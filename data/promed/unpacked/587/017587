There was panic yesterday [20 Jan 2018] in Lokoja, the Kogi state capital, following the death of a 7-month-old child infected with the dreaded Lassa fever. The child died at the Federal Medical Centre in Lokoja.

Incidentally, the authorities at the Medical Centre have also confirmed that doctor caring for the late baby has also contacted the deadly disease. The Medical Director of the Centre, Dr Olatunde Alabi, confirmed that the male doctor was diagnosed of the disease on [Fri 19 Jan 2018].

He said that the victim's blood sample was sent to the Federal Medical Centre, Irrua, Edo state, and that the blood sample tested positive. Alabi added that the 30-year-old doctor was in the early hours of [Sat 20 Jan 2018] evacuated to Irrua for further treatment.

According to the Medical Director, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the state's Ministry of Health, and other stakeholders have been informed of the development and are already assisting the Centre in various ways.

All the people that came in contact with the sick doctor, both at home and work, had since been placed under surveillance, he added.

According to Alabi, the Medical Centre had, in conjunction with some partners and stakeholders, commenced tracing the source of the disease and to ascertain if there is any other victim within the community where the doctor resided.

[This is another unfortunate example of transmission of Lassa fever virus to a healthcare worker in a hospital setting. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or their excreta as was likely the case of the infant. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened with the case of the infected physician.

Images of the _Mastomys_ mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.

The Ondo State government has confirmed 24 cases of Lassa fever and 5 deaths from the deadly disease in 4 Local Government Areas in the state.

The State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Yemi Olowolabi, who confirmed this to newsmen listed the local government areas affected as Owo, Akoko South/West, Akure North, and Akure South.

He, however, said the government had strengthened its medical apparatuses in all its specialist hospitals to contain the spread of the disease.

Mr Olowolabi informed that the isolation centre at the Federal Medical centre in Owo had also been reinforced to take adequate care of patients as part of efforts to check the spread of the disease.

He revealed that government was embarking on sensitisation of the public on unhygienic habits that could aid the spread of Lassa fever in the state.

The recent outbreak of Lassa fever has killed 4 in Ebonyi state, an official has said. The Commissioner for Health, Daniel Umezuruike, also said 139 persons have been placed under surveillance in the state.

Also schools have been shut down in the state as government scrambles to curtail the rampaging deadly disease.

Addressing journalists in Abakaliki, Mr Umezuruike revealed that a total of 9 cases have been confirmed. "At present, the state has a total of 9 confirmed cases, 4 deaths, and 3 others on treatment including 139 persons now under surveillance.

"Also, a mother has been confirmed positive and is presently taking treatment and this incident happened yesterday [Wed 17 Jan 2018]."

"We have 3 patients on treatments and all of them are doing well and we have contact tracing and we have 139 people we have kept on surveillance.

Mr Umezuruike however assured that the state government was handling the situation well. "We have set up all the committees and strategies to ensure that this disease is brought under control within the shortest possible time and the strategies are working out well. We don't have new cases of the disease as at yesterday [18 Jan 2018], so the situation has been brought under control.

"Schools closure came up when we had 3 positive cases and ministry of education noticed that one of them has children in schools and closed down schools in Ebonyi state. We have put all the strategies and everything is working out, we believe that the situation will be brought under control."

Meanwhile, the outbreak has also forced the wife of the governor, Rachel Umahi, to cancel her visit to Afikpo Local Government Area, which was scheduled to take place on [Fri 19 Jan 2018].

Dr Giyan Joshua-Ndom, the Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Keffi, Nasarawa state, says the hospital is currently handling 3 cases of suspected Lassa fever.

Joshua-Ndom told our NAN [News Agency of Nigeria] in Keffi on [Thu 18 Jan 2018] that the hospital had taken the patients' blood samples for test to ascertain whether or not they had the disease.

"The patients have been separated from other patients," he revealed.

"There are 3 suspected cases and we have taken adequate measures in order to tackle the situation because the health of the people is our concern.

"I want to use this medium to appeal to patients and members of the public not to panic, but to remain calm.

"Necessary steps have been taken to avert the spread of the virus in case there is any," he said.

The medical director also restated the commitment of the centre to good policies and projects that had direct bearing on the lives of Nigerians.

Lassa fever virus is transmitted to humans through contamination of broken skin via direct or indirect contact with the excreta or urine of infected rats. One can also contract it through the consumption of contaminated rat. [If the rat is well cooked, the virus would be inactivated. Handling the rat or preparing it for cooking could result in exposure to the virus. - Mod.TY]

In Benin, on 8 Jan 2018, a confirmed case of Lassa fever was reported in the Tanguiéta-Matéri-Cobly Health Zone [Atacora department].

The case is a 35-year-old man from the village of Nadoba in Togo, bordering with the village of Boukoumbé [Atacora] in Benin. The patient became ill on 25 Dec 2017, during a visit to Nigeria.

Upon his return, he sought care at the Boukoumbé Health Center before being transferred to the Tanquiéta hospital.

[Of the patient's contacts,] 10 were identified and followed, 9 of whom are healthcare workers.

Reminders about Lassa fever
---------------------------
Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever that is known to be endemic in various West African countries, including Nigeria, and causes epidemics almost every year, with annual peaks observed between December and June. Lassa virus was first described in 1969 in the city of Lassa, Borno state, Nigeria.

Lassa fever is caused by a virus of the family Arenaviridae, the Lassa virus, whose reservoir is a rodent (_Mastomys_). The virus is endemic in several West African countries where epidemic outbreaks occur regularly and affect 100 to 300 000 people per year, of which 5 to 6000 succumb. Transmission to humans is through contact with food or household products contaminated by the faeces of the reservoir host, inhalation of aerosols of dust contaminated with rodent excreta, or inter-human contact.

The clinical picture of Lassa fever is variable, from asymptomatic infection, very common (80 percent of cases) to a lightning haemorrhagic fever. The disease begins 6-21 days after the infection with clinical signs including fever, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, and asthenia. In severe cases, the symptoms worsen, with the appearance of edema, haemorrhagic signs, pericardial and pleural effusions, and more rarely encephalitis. The patient dies in a context of hypotensive and hypovolemic shock and renal and hepatic failure.

Lassa fever is extremely serious for the pregnant woman, frequently leading to the death of the mother and systematically to that of the fetus.

Ribavirin (anti-viral drug) has been used successfully in patients with Lassa fever.

Lassa fever is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality.

World Health Organization advice
--------------------------------
The prevention of Lassa fever is based on the promotion of good "community hygiene" to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should always apply standard infection prevention and control precautions when caring for patients, regardless of their presumed diagnosis.

On rare occasions, travelers from regions where Lassa fever is endemic export the disease to other countries. Although other tropical infections are much more common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposure in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be endemic. Healthcare workers who see a patient suspected of having Lassa fever should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and laboratory tests.
