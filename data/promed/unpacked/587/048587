There has been a further outbreak of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza in Turkey. A farm with a susceptible population of 170 000 birds had 137 deaths from the disease. The rest of the birds on the farm have been destroyed as a containment measure.

A protection zone with a 3 km radius and a surveillance zone with a 7 km radius surrounding the protection zone were established. The outbreak occurred in the west of the country.

[The above media report is based upon Turkey's follow-up report No 2 to the OIE, submitted 18 May 2015, addressing an outbreak in Moralimar, in the western province of Manisa (map included).

The report includes the following epidemiological comments:
"H5N1 virus was detected in a poultry farm in Moralilar. Protection zone [with a] 3 km radius and a surveillance zone [with a] 7 km radius surrounding the protection zone were established. All poultry were destroyed in the protection zone. Holdings and pens were cleaned and disinfected after the destruction process. Outbreaks in Edincik and Ikizciler are currently [being] monitored."

Manisa has become the 3rd Turkish province with HPAI H5N1. Previous outbreaks reported by the Turkish authorities were located in northern Turkey (Ikizciler, Kastamonu province; notified 4 May) and in the west (Edincik, Baliesir province; notified 11 May).

Subscribers may recall ProMED-mail's RFI of 3 May 2015 regarding suspected HPAI in the Balikesir province, which reportedly may have started much earlier (see 20150503.3338904). - Mod.AS
