In France the government said all tests on canned Coca-Cola products have
turned up negative, suggesting the French Agency for Food Safety could lift
the ban on Coke sales soon.
About 800 cases were brought to the attention of experts in France, and of
those, nine ''were very precisely studied by toxicology specialists,''
Kochner said. None could be clearly linked to a problem with Coca-Cola
products, he said.
The European Union is seeking further investigation into what caused more
than 200 cases of stomach pains, nausea and hyperventilation linked to
drinking Coca-Cola products. Some children had to stay two nights in the
hospital.
Selective bans on Coca-Cola products in Belgium, France and other European
countries entered their second week. Belgium banned all Coca-Cola products
on June 14, and only restored some of its brands to store shelves Thursday.
France has banned sale of cans produced at a plant in Dunkirk. The
Netherlands and Switzerland also have imposed selective bans.
The 15-nation EU's Executive Commission has said Belgium and France would
conduct inspections on Coca-Cola plants over the next few days.
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has blamed defective carbon dioxide, used to put
fizz in its drinks, for problems at its Antwerp manufacturing plant in
Belgium. [The Swedish supplier of the CO2 has denied that there was
anything wrong with it - Mod.JW. The company also said the outside of cans
made in Dunkirk became contaminated with a wood preservative during
shipping. The company said the two unrelated problems led to nausea and
vomiting. But one company-commissioned study suggested the health
problems were psychosomatic.
Belgian officials were skeptical of that explanation. ''Thirty children had
to be hospitalized. Eight had to spend the night in hospital. Four had to
spend two nights in hospital. It makes me doubt any argument about
psychosomatic,'' said Health Ministry
spokesman Marc Pattyn.
