The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) was notified of an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Guangdong by the National Health and Family Planning Commission today (18 Jan 2016) and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a woman aged 31 in Futian, Shenzhen. She developed fever and cough on 8 Jan [2016] and is currently hospitalised for treatment in critical condition.

From 2014 to date, a total of 9 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the mainland health authorities.

"All novel influenza A infections, including H5N6, are statutory notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said. "We will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," the spokesman said.

The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is underway. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:

- do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- if contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

[The H5N6 flu virus has been detected in poultry in China, Laos and Viet Nam. The virus emerged in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6. There have been a total of 9 human cases since its recognition, but 4 have been reported since 29 Dec 2015 in Guangdong province. In response to this uptick in cases of H5N6, a report was issued reassuring the public that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/15/c_135013921.htm).
