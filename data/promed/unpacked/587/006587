Two Washington postal workers died of anthrax
----------------------------------------------
Washington DC Mayor Anthony Williams said Tuesday that 2 Brentwood
postal workers who died Monday had inhalation anthrax. Those 2 deaths
were confirmed as anthrax deaths, said Dr. Ivan Walks, Washington
DC's health director. Another 2 postal workers from Brentwood remain
hospitalized with inhalation anthrax.
Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said
Tuesday that scientists will "immediately" check any postal facility
through which an anthrax-tainted letter or package is processed.
Testing and treating of postal workers also will be a part of the
rapid response.
House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Missouri, said he thinks
mail-processing equipment that applies pressure to envelopes may have
played a critical role in spreading anthrax spores at Brentwood.
Gephardt described the anthrax spores mailed to the Senate as "weapons
grade," a label that differs from other political and health officials
who have been cautious in characterizing the type of bacteria
contained in anthrax-laced letters.

[Weapons grade & professional grade are terms that have not been
clearly defined in the media. The spores in the letters had apparently
been milled to remove clumping and make them more likely to pass
through the nasal passages into the lungs, which is which is one step
in weaponization. Another step is to add a stabiliser -- we have not
been told if this has been identified. A third step would be to
bioengineer the anthrax strain to be resistant to current antibiotics
& vaccines. This strain is evidently susceptible to Cipro as long as
the lung infection is identified early enough. - Mod.JW
