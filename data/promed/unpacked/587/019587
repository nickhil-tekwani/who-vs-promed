As of 9 Jun 2014, a total of 17 persons infected with the outbreak strain of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O121 have been reported from 5 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Idaho (3), Michigan (1), Montana (2), Utah (1), and Washington (10).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illnesses began range from 1 May 2014 to 20 May 2014. Ill persons range in age from 11 years to 45 years, with a median age of 27 years. 66 per cent of ill persons are female. Among those persons with information, 7 (47 per cent) of 15 have been hospitalized. No ill persons have developed HUS, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation update
--------------------
As part of the ongoing investigation, FDA performed a traceback analysis and determined that Evergreen Sprouts, in the timeframe prior to the outbreak, supplied sprouts to 7 restaurants at which 9 people who became ill during the outbreak reported eating before they became ill. 8 of the people who became ill recalled eating sprouts. This analysis used documents collected directly from the distributors and the grower, Evergreen Fresh Sprouts, as well as documents collected by the states from the points of service.

FDA also conducted an inspection of Evergreen Fresh Sprouts' facility on 22-23 May 2014; 27-30 May 2014; and 6 Jun 2014. During the inspection, FDA investigators observed a number of unsanitary conditions, including condensate and irrigation water dripping from rusty valves; a rusty and corroded mung bean room watering system; tennis rackets that had scratches, chips, and frayed plastic used to scoop mung bean sprouts; a pitchfork with corroded metal being used to transfer mung bean sprouts; and a squeegee with visible corroded metal and non-treated wood being used to agitate mung bean sprouts inside a soak vat.

[Since the 1st CDC posting on 22 May 2014, the number of states has increased from 2 (Idaho and Washington) to 5, with the addition of the states of Michigan, Montana, and Utah and the total number of cases increased from 10 to 17.

The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) serotype is identified as O121, one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5).

Sprouts are a very notable vehicle for EHEC. Sprouting generally involves germinating seeds (which may be contaminated) at temperatures higher than ambient temperature facilitating a higher bacterial inoculum. Sprouts have been the vehicle for 2 notable outbreaks. In July 1996, almost 10 000 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 occurred primarily in schoolchildren in Sakai City, Osaka, Japan, transmitted by white radish sprouts (7). During 2011, an outbreak centered in northern Germany (8) involved a chimeric, non-zoonotic EHEC/EAEC _E. coli_ O104:H4 spread by fenugreek sprouts and infecting almost 4000 people. This unique outbreak produced one of the largest number of deaths ever reported from a Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, more than 50.
