India: Encephalitis Kills 63 in Northern India (Uttar Pradesh)
--------------------------------------------------
Mosquito-borne encephalitis has killed at least 63 people, mostly children,
in northern India in the past 4 weeks, a health official said on Wed 10 Sep
2003. The death toll could increase, because authorities are awaiting
reports from remote areas of Gorakhpur district in Uttar Pradesh state,
said Dr. Diwakar Sinha, a senior official in the state's health department.
"At least 425 cases were registered and 63 have died," Sinha said.
The deaths in Uttar Pradesh brought the nationwide death toll from the
virus to 336 so far in 2003. Earlier this year, at least 273 people died in
2 other Indian states, where scientists said most of the deaths were caused
by a virus in the same family as Japanese encephalitis virus. [Japanese
encephalitis virus belongs to the family _Flaviviridae_ . The other major
pathogens in this family are the 4 serotypes of Dengue virus. Lack of
specific information makes any assignment speculative. Further information
would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
Another health official in Uttar Pradesh said the victims mostly lived in
the outskirts of villages or near water-logged paddy fields. In Uttar
Pradesh, an impoverished state, outbreaks of encephalitis are routine. In
2002, at least 300 people died. Symptoms of the disease start with very
high fever, followed by seizures, vomiting, then vomiting of blood, and
finally coma. There also are behavioral changes and delirium.
Mosquito-borne diseases have been spread partly by stronger-than-normal
monsoon rains in many parts of India in 2003.

[A similar report was received yesterday from Nepal (see reference below).
The lowland areas on both sides of the border between the Terai region of
Nepal and Uttar Pradesh state in India provide a suitable environment for
the spread of mosquito-transmitted disease. The vulnerability of children
is compatible with the diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis. However, the
occurrence of similar disease caused by an unidentified virus (possibly a
flavivirus) in 2 other (unnamed) Indian states earlier in 2003 raises
questions about the reliability of the diagnosis. Some past epidemics of
this type in India have been attributed to a variety of agents (mutated
measles virus, henipavirus, Chandipura virus) with ultimate resolution.
Further information would be appreciated. - Mods.MPP/CP]
