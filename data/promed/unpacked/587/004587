On 13 Feb 2007, the Department of Livestock and Fisheries of the
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry informed the National Avian
Human Influenza Coordination Office of the detection of H5N1 among
ducks on a private farm in Phonpapao-thong village, and in a private
backyard in Dongsavath village in Sisattanak district, Vientiane.
The report specified that 7 of the 1100 ducks on the farm had died,
while more than 100 were sick, and that 12 of the 600 ducks [in the
private backyard] had died.
The movement of poultry in and out of the detected areas was
restricted, and more than 83 000 people living in the 50 villages
near the area were surveyed for suspect symptoms from 14-15 Feb
2007. Authorities were also checking inhabitants in 20 villages
between Xaysettha and Sisattanak districts, and plan to cull all
ducks on the 2 affected properties.

Laos' last outbreak of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1
started, reportedly, on 14 Jul 2006 (notified, after confirmation, 4
Aug 2006). It involved chickens in a commercial farm at Dong Bang,
Vientiane, adjacent to the Thai border. Out of 6000 birds, 2500 died
prior to the culling of the remainder.

Animal Health Information Database) website

According to the above newswire, the mortality rate in the currently
affected duck holdings was, on 13 Feb 2007 (probably the early stages
of the outbreaks) rather low: 7/1100 and 12/600. It would help to
obtain additional morbidity and mortality data collected prior to the
culling of the flocks.

Poultry and eggs produced at farms near Moscow are safe to eat,
Russia's animal and plant health watchdog said Saturday [17 Feb 2007].
Rosselkhoznadzor's (the Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Surveillance) statement came a day after health
officials confirmed avian flu as the cause of chicken and turkey
deaths at 2 private farmsteads outside the Russian capital.
Russia recorded its 1st cases of bird flu in August 2005, but until
now, outbreaks have occurred only in southern provinces and in Siberia.
Gennady Onishchenko, the country's chief epidemiologist and head of
the Rospotrebnadzor [Territorial Directorate of the Federal Services
for Consumer Protection and Human Wellfare] said Fri 16 Feb 2007:
"Vets... confirm it is the H5N1 strain." But he said "the
pathogenicity of this virus for humans has not been
confirmed." Onishchenko also said it was highly unlikely that the
virus detected in the Domodedovo district, south of Moscow, and in
the western district of Odintsovo, would spread to commercial farms.
He gave assurances that all local poultry producers "are modern and
self-contained operations."
On Sat 17 Feb 2007, however, Rosselkhoznadzor Veterinary Oversight
Department Head, Nikolai Vlasov, said tests are still ongoing and
that it yet remains to be seen whether, indeed, the birds in
Domodedovo and Odintsovo died of H5N1, a bird flu strain potentially
lethal to humans. "We will know exactly which strain it is by Sunday
[18 Feb 2007] evening," Vlasov said. He cautioned against
overdramatizing the situation, as all of Russia's poultry farms have
been taking precautions against bird flu for 2 years now.
One of many measures to minimize the risk of avian flu outbreaks has
been a ban for people working at poultry farms to keep birds at home,
said Vlasov. "The measures will now be toughened further, of course," he added.
In a separate development, Russia's Emergency Situations Ministry
reported wild fowl deaths in the southern region of Krasnodar
Saturday. It said between 100 and 1000 dead ducks had been found in
coastal areas, but that preliminary tests had detected no bird flu
virus in the birds.

A 3rd avian flu outbreak has been detected at a private farm in the
Moscow Region, the acting governor said Saturday [17 Feb 2007]. "A
resident of the Podolsk District [south of Moscow] bought a chicken
on Moscow's Ptichy pet market, and 44 birds at his farmstead died as
a result," Alexei Panteleyev said.
Russia's chief epidemiologist, Gennady Onishchenko, on Friday [16 Feb
2007] confirmed bird flu as the cause of poultry deaths in 2 other
households outside the capital -- in the southern Domodedovo District
and in Odintsovo, to the west. [But see last sentence below "It is
yet unclear whether H5N1 ... is responsible". - Mod.JW]
The Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance
(Rosselkhoznadzor), said earlier Saturday [17 Feb 2007] the dead
birds there have been traced to the same Moscow market and that they
were presumably brought in from other regions.
Russia recorded its 1st cases of bird flu in August 2005, but until
now, outbreaks have occurred only in southern provinces and in Siberia.
All pavilions that sell birds at Moscow's Ptichy market have been
closed since Friday [16 Feb 2007], and veterinary inspectors are now
looking for any traces of the virus there.
A telephone hotline has been opened for residents of the Moscow
Region who bought any birds on the Ptichy market after 1 Feb 2007.
It is yet unclear whether H5N1, a strain potentially lethal to
humans, is responsible for the poultry deaths near Moscow, but strict
security measures are now being taken all across the region to
prevent the virus spreading to commercial farms.

[Laboratory test results are anticipated; if confirmed, the official
notification is expected to include complementary details.
Russia's last notification to the OIE on H5N1 involved an outbreak in
Krasnodar, affecting native chickens and traditionally raised ducks,
geese and turkey cocks. The notification, including map, is available at:

Residents of the Dok IX area in Jayapura voluntarily culled 56 fowls
and one bird Thursday [15 Feb 2007], after 7 chickens believed to be
infected with bird flu died suddenly.
Jayapura Mayor Mr. Kambu and representatives of the mayoralty
offices, including Papua Livestock Husbandry chairman AR Pintadewa
and Papua Animal Quarantine head Elias Inte, witnessed the
culling. The fowls were gathered from nearby houses and slaughtered
before being burned in a pit. "I have raised chickens for sale for a
long time, but because of the discovery of the bird flu infection, I
just let my 23 fowls be culled," said one of the local residents.
If the presence of the virus were confirmed, it would make Jayapura
the 3rd city in Papua and West Papua to be hit by bird flu, along
with Manokwari and Timika.
It is not yet known how the virus might have gotten there. Elias Inte
said his agency had strictly supervised the entrance of chickens into
Jayapura by air and sea. "As soon as chickens arrive from outside,
they are immediately eliminated," he said.
The nearby livestock husbandry office suspected an outbreak after
local residents reported the deaths of the chickens. Officers sent to
the area took blood samples from the dead chickens for laboratory
testing at the veterinary agency in Maros, South Sulawesi.
In Jambi, a suspected bird flu patient was admitted to Raden
Mattabher Hospital, the 6th to be treated at the hospital this week
[11-18 Feb 2007]. A hospital employee said the 5-year-old patient had
bird flu-like symptoms such as difficulty breathing, a high fever and coughing.

Bird flu spreads to 10 villages in Turkey
-----------------------------------------
DIYARBAKIR: Bird flu has spread to 10 villages in southeast Turkey,
where 4 children died of the virus a year ago [2006], but no human
cases have been reported, agriculture officials said on Friday [16 Feb 2007].
Provincial agriculture officials said bird flu had been detected on
Friday in 2 villages in Diyarbakir, one of 2 neighbouring provinces
in the poor and rural southeast where the virus has hit. More tests
were needed to determine whether it was the deadly H5N1 strain of the
virus, which was detected in the region last week. The 2 villages
were quarantined and 340 birds were destroyed, the officials said.

[A laboratory confirmation of H5N1, or otherwise, is anticipated. The
area affected in south-east Turkey can be seen in WHO's map: "World
Areas reporting confirmed occurrence of H5N1 avian influenza in
poultry and wild birds since 1 January 2007, status as of 14 Feb 2007
(latest available update)", at
<http://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/Global_SubNat_H5N1inAnimalConfirmed_2007_20070214.png>.
The previous reported outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in Papua took place in
August 2006 (see ProMED Avian influenza (178) - Indonesia (Papua)
20060809.2236). Results of the current laboratory tests are awaited.
The readiness of the owners to sacrifice their chickens in
consideration of the suspected infection reflects a high level of AI
alertness and awareness in Papua. The presence of officials is,
hopefully, indicative of the intention to compensate the
owners. Early and full compensation for culled animals are
prerequisites for efficient disease prevention and control.
New Guinea, the world's 2nd largest island after Greenland, is
politically divided into independent (east) and Indonesian (west)
territories. The eastern, independent (since 1975) territory, is
Papua New Guinea; the western, Indonesian territory, is divided
(since 2003) into 2 provinces: West Irian Jaya and Papua. A map of
the region is available at:
