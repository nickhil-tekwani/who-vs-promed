We report the case of a 22-year-old female, ordinarily resident in the
UK, who has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary histoplasmosis
following a biology field trip in Uganda. Our patient spent one month
in Uganda from 19 Jun to 20 Jul 2011, studying insects, primates, and
bats in the rainforest near Fort Portal [Kabarole district, western
Uganda] close to the Congolese border. On a single occasion during the
last week of her trip she and fellow students climbed into a hollow
tree full of bats.

Our patient traveled to Canada on 24 Jul 2011 where, on 1 Aug 2011,
she developed a flu-like illness followed by a dry cough and mild
exertional shortness of breath. A chest x-ray in Canada showed
diffuse, miliary shadowing. Induced sputum was negative for AFB
staining. She returned to the UK on 22 Aug 2011. She continued to have
exertional dyspnea as well as chest pain. She was reviewed at
Blackpool Victoria Hospital where oxygen saturations were 93 percent
on room air and a chest x-ray showed persistent diffuse nodularity
with the suspicion of a thin-walled cavity in the right lower lobe.
She was referred to our Tropical and Infectious Disease Unit at the
Royal Liverpool University Hospital with suspected pulmonary
histoplasmosis, which has been confirmed with serology.

Of the group of 24 who visited Uganda, 8 others have been diagnosed
with histoplasmosis in their home country (another in the UK and one
in each in Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Poland,
South Africa, and Madagascar). These 8 individuals shared the same
risk factor for exposure, having also climbed into the bat-infested
tree. 2 of the 8 were initially suspected of having tuberculosis
before being diagnosed with histoplasmosis.

In addition to these 9 cases of histoplasmosis, a 10th member of the
group, from the Netherlands, was diagnosed with miliary TB while
traveling in Kenya.

Our patient has been reported to the GeoSentinel Surveillance site.
Her symptoms are resolving spontaneously and she has not required
treatment. We are reporting this patient in case other physicians
encounter travelers from the same or similar groups. We would be eager
to hear from other specialists involved with this particular outbreak
in order to collate data.

The following was obtained from Medscape
(http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/299054-overview#showall):

"_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a dimorphic fungus that remains in a
mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body
temperature in mammals. Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the
fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates
throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and
Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the
fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central
America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern
Asia, and Australia.

The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic damp
environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial
growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats
and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit
the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby
enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can
become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings.
Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks
of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and
renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition,
travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because
airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.

Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who
develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are
exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may
remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment
of cell-mediated immunity.

Approximately 90 percent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms
develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache,
malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms;
usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a
large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse
pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6
percent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar and mediastinal
lymph nodes are present in 5-10 percent of patients. Cough,
hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related
to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation.
Paratracheal involvement may cause cough or dyspnea because of
compression on the trachea or bronchi."

African histoplasmosis is a systemic infection caused by the fungus
_Histoplasma capsulatum_ var. _duboisii_ which occurs, with very few
exceptions, only on the central part African continent, most commonly
in west and central Africa, particularly Nigeria, Senegal, the
Democratic Republic of Congo, and Angola. The _duboisii_ variety has
yeast cells that average about twice the size of _H. capsulatum_ var.
_capsulatum_. In general, the _duboisii_ variant is recognized when
presenting with dissemination to skin, bone, and lymph node rather
than the primary lung form. Both variants are more likely to
disseminate in the presence of immune suppression. - Mod.LL]
