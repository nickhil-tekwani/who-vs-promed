virus newly reported in _Mentha_ crops in India. BSPP New Disease
Reports, vol. 18]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spearmint (_Mentha spicata_; family _Lamiaceae_), an important
essential oil-bearing crop, is cultivated on 0.15 million ha land of
India. Approximately 80 percent of its planting consists of identical
genetic material. _Mentha_ spp. have been reported to be affected by
many viral diseases.

In a field of _M. spicata_ at Lucknow [Uttar Pradesh], and in
adjoining areas the occurrence of a begomovirus-caused disease was for
the 1st time observed during May and June 2005. Typical symptoms were
foliar rugosity [wrinkling], light yellow mosaic, upward curling,
crinkling and retarded growth leading to drastic reduction in yield
(Fig.1 -- see below for links to figures). In 2007, the disease
incidence was recorded to be in the range of 50 to 60 percent. The
disease also appeared in the Tarai region of Uttaranchal province.

Infected plants were used for electron microscopy, whitefly
transmission tests and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-mediated
begomovirus-specific diagnostics, but no virus particles, cytopathic
effects or inclusion bodies were detected. However, from the naturally
infected plants, the disease was transmitted to healthy seedlings of
_M. spicata_ by whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_), but not by aphids or
mechanical inoculation. Viruliferous whiteflies did not transmit the
infection to other mint species (_M. arvensis_; _M. citrata_ or _M.
piperita_) in glasshouse tests, confirmed through PCR.

Symptomatic and asymptomatic _Mentha_ samples from different
locations were tested by PCR specific to begomovirus coat protein. A
product 771 bp [base pairs] in size was amplified from symptomatic,
but not from asymptomatic plant samples (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis
(Fig. 3) showed the highest levels of sequence identity (93 percent)
with the begomovirus Tomato leaf curl Pakistan virus.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of a begomovirus associated
with an economically relevant disease of spearmint in India, and the
2nd finding of a geminivirus in a species of _Labiatae_ worldwide,
the other one consisting of a partial sequence from a putatively
bipartite begomovirus collected from the weed _Leonurus_ sp. in Brazil.

[Begomoviruses (family _Geminiviridae_) affect many economically
important crops causing symptoms often including leaf yellowing,
distortion, stunting, reduced plant vigour, and yield losses. They
are transmitted by different whitefly vectors and many may also be
transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed
transmitted. Disease management of begomoviruses relies on control of
the vector and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In
some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

The whitefly _B. tabaci_ is believed to be a species complex with a
number of recognised biotypes varying in their distribution and
vector activities. They are widely distributed and have a very wide
host range. Whiteflies have been reported to transmit over 100 virus
species, including many begomoviruses, but also cause serious crop
damage by direct feeding.

The new virus appears to be related to species in the tomato leaf
curl and tomato yellow leaf curl viral clades which contain many
economically important viruses. There seems to be some inconsistency
as to the taxonomy of Tomato leaf curl Pakistan virus; it is listed
by the Internationl Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) as a
strain, not a species, in the tomato leaf curl group. Several other
species or strains of this group have been reported from India
previously (see previous ProMED-mail posts below).
