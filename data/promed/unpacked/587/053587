New WHO Influenza Vaccine Recommendations for use in the 2010/2011
influenza season in the northern hemisphere
---------------------------------
From: Eurosurveillance editorial team, European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control, Stockholm, Sweden

The World Health Organization (WHO) today, 18 Feb 2010, published
recommendations for the composition of influenza virus vaccines for
the forthcoming season in the northern hemisphere (November 2010 to
April 2011) [1].

They foresee a trivalent vaccine including also a 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) strain:

- an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like virus;
- an A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus*;
- a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.

*A/Wisconsin/15/2009 is an A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like virus and is a
2010 southern hemisphere vaccine virus.

Each year, representatives of the WHO Collaborating Centres on
Influenza meet to analyse the data and make recommendations for the
following year's vaccine strains. The recommendations are used by
pharmaceutical manufacturers to update the composition of the vaccine
so that vaccine strains are matched to circulating strains the
following year. WHO also provides the manufacturers with prototype
strains for the seasonal vaccine.
