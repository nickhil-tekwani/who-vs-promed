[As with many of the previous reports of encephalitis coming from
eastern Uttar Pradesh this year (2011), there is no indication of the
etiological agent responsible for the above cases of encephalitis. A
report from the Minister of Women & Child Development indicated that
as of 31 Oct 2011, 462 children died from undiagnosed acute
encephalitis syndrome, and 27 children died from Japanese encephalitis
virus infection in 2011 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20111209.3555).
