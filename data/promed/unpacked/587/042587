[In the post Dengue/DHF update (106): Asia, Pacific archive number 20131230.2143621, Cairns was incorrectly identified as being located in New South Wales, Australia. Cairns is in fact located in the state of Queensland, not New South Wales. ProMED-mail apologizes for the error and thanks Dr. David Thompson and Irene Lai for pointing out the error. - Mod.TY]
