Since mid-2019, the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) has received an increased number of reports and submitted cases of dead hares, with the largest numbers originating from counties north of the river Dalilven (approx. Lat. 60A 73N). An increase in the number of reports submitted through the online form for reporting wildlife diseases rapporteravilt.sva.se indicated an ongoing outbreak already in July [2019].

Tularemia could be confirmed in multiple cases by pathology and confirmed with PCR or immunohistochemistry in dead hares submitted for diagnostic examination at SVA. Of 266 reports of dead hares, representing 320 carcasses for this year [2019] so far, 257 were reported from July [2019] to this date. Of 84 hares examined at SVA (almost equal number of European brown hare _Lepus europeaus_ and Mountain hare _Lepus timidus_) 22 were positive for tularemia; 16 cases from north of Dalilven, and 6 cases from south of this river.

The southernmost case was in the southern county of Blekinge, an unusual finding of tularemia so far south in the country. Tularemia cases in hares are also more common in the same counties where increased numbers of human cases are reported. A geographical correlation between cases of tularemia in hares and cases in humans has been observed.
