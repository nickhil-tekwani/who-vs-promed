The disease in horses which has broken out in Iceland is still unknown.
Text of a fax received on 18 March 1998 from Dr Halldor Runolfsson, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Reykjavik:
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: first two weeks in
February 1998.
Location of the outbreaks: the first cases occurred in stables near
Reykjavik and soon spread to stables in neighbouring towns and to farms in
Arnessysla county, east of the Reykjavik area. So far, all cases have
occurred in the southwest of Iceland.
Of a total estimated 80,000 horses in the country, there have been about
4000 cases reported, 4 animals dead, 3 destroyed.
Diagnosis: the first few cases were diagnosed as listeriosis, which is not
uncommon in Iceland during this time of year, but this was later ruled out.
So far, investigations in Iceland and at the State Veterinary Laboratories
in Uppsala, Sweden, have failed to reveal the true nature of this disease.
A. Clinical picture: clinical examination reveals high temperature, even up
to more than 42o C, which only lasts for about two to three days. Most
horses lose their appetite during this period and some signs of abdominal
discomfort can be seen. Three horses have been humanely killed, due to
abdominal distress that did not respond to therapy. No signs of respiratory
illness can be seen.
B. Post-mortem findings: the horses that were killed were autopsied and the
most obvious abnormalities were found in the small intestines, where severe
swelling of the mucosa was the predominant feature. In two horses, the
kidneys were also swollen. Blood examination revealed severe leucopenia.
C. Causal agent: the causative agent, which is believed to be a virus, has
not yet been identified. One possible explanation is that this could be a
virus common in horses in Europe but not clinically manifested there due to
acquired immunity. Once in Iceland, this virus could cause disease in the
Icelandic horse, due to the centuries-long isolation of the breed and almost
total lack of immunity to viral diseases.
Mode of spread: most cases occur in the closely situated stables in towns,
but the disease has also spread between horse farms in Arnessysla county,
in an as yet unexplained manner.
Control measures during reporting period: The first news release on this
disease was issued by the office of the Chief Veterinary Officer on 20
February 1998, urging people to take care in their handling of horses. All
export of horses was stopped on 22 February and will not be allowed until
it can be certified with total confidence that the exported animals are
free from this disease.
On 27 February, a regulation was enacted which placed a ban on all
transport of horses between stables and farms in the whole of Iceland.
Severe restrictions were also placed on the movement of people handling
horses. Today, most of Iceland is regarded as free from this disease, and
precautionary measures to prevent further spread will stay in force until
more is known about its cause.
