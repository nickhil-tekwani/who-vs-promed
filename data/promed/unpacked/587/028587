Asian soybean rust [ASR] has been confined to southern states this summer and
likely won't affect Midwestern fields this year, experts said. Soybean rust
causes premature leaf loss, leading to fewer bean pods, fewer seeds per pod
and early maturity, all of which adds up to lost crop yield. It arrived in the
southern United States from South America late in 2004, and reached as far
north as Missouri.
"There is still a remote chance we could see it, but it's a very, very low
chance," said Loren Giesler, a University of Nebraska extension plant
pathologist. "If we see it in northern states, it'll be late enough in crop
production that [it] won't damage yield."
ASR spores have actually been detected this year as far north as Wisconsin,
Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas in spore traps set up by Syngenta Crop
Protection, a private company, but ASR failed to infect plants there, Giesler
said. But there have been no confirmed cases of the fungus infecting plants
this summer north of Atlanta. Still, because ASR is infecting soybeans in
Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi, it could survive
another winter in the South.
That means ASR could spread northward next year if weather conditions are
right, said Susanne Bissonnette, a soybean rust expert with University of
Illinois Extension, and farmers are no less worried about a disease that
scientists are still trying to understand. "Just because we didn't have it
this year -- yet -- means nothing about next week or next year," said Jeff
Abbey, who grows about 800 acres of soybeans near Bloomington, Ill. Giesler
said there's no way to predict what happens next year.
"If we see rust spread to the west, in Mexico, Texas, or Central America, that
will increase the chance of finding it in our region." If it gets cold enough
far south enough this winter, that would limit spreading next year. Prevailing
winds can make the difference, he said. "We don't really know the exact
reasons why it didn't balloon out and spread faster and farther," said Glen
Hartman, a plant pathologist at the National Soybean Research Laboratory on
the University of Illinois campus.
Part of the reason the fungus has been confined to the South may be because it
survived only in Florida during the winter of 2004-5. "If the epidemic had
started in Louisiana or the bottom part of the Mississippi Valley, I think
there would have been more chance for it to move up," Hartman said.
Since it was first spotted in this country last year, there were no
preparations for finding, tracking and battling the disease. The government
and agriculture industry has spent millions to provide information to farmers
and train them to hunt for rust. Researchers from Florida to North Dakota also
planted sentinel plots, special fields that are closely monitored to help
track the fungus. In Nebraska, there are 48 of those plots, Giesler said.
"I don't remember any other (crop) disease in history where we've had so much
interest and training ahead of time," Hartman said.
Farmers remain fearful of a disease that can cost a lot to fight.

[The possibility that Hurricane Katrina may exacerbate spread of ASR in the
southern states may be a factor in the coming weeks. Given that ASR is
widespread in those states and that kudzu is a perennial ASR host, the disease
could be a problem for soybean growers in the 2006 crop season.
