Some 62 people have died so far this year [2017] in the Dominican Republic because of leptospirosis, 7 more than in the same period of the previous year, the Ministry of Public Health reported today [13 Dec 2017].

A report from the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health stated that in the last registered epidemiological week, from 19 to 25 Nov 2017, 14 suspected cases of leptospirosis were reported, for a total of 59 cases in the last 4 weeks, including 9 deaths.

In total, up to that period, 695 cases of leptospirosis have been reported in the country, with a [case fatality rate] of 10% (62 deaths) [62 deaths out of 695 cases gives a case fatality rate of 8.9%], compared to 540 cases and 55 deaths in the same period of 2016, the report said.

Leptospirosis is an acute bacterial disease that affects both humans as animals and is acquired through contact with standing water and soils contaminated with urine from reservoir animals, such as rats and others of the canine, porcine and caprine species.

[Leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic has been reported previously by ProMED-mail (see archives listed below). In 2006, it was attributed to "sanitary problems and to deficiencies in municipal garbage collection." Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic, as elsewhere, has also follow heavy rainfall and the ensuing contaminated fresh water flooding. Also, the Dominican Republic is the 2nd-largest Caribbean producer of sugarcane, the nation's most important crop (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Dominican_Republic), and sugar cane workers may be exposed to soil and vegetation contaminated by the urine of chronically infected rats living in the cane fields. However, the news report above fails to delineate the types of exposure that placed the most recent cases at risk for leptospirosis in the Dominican Republic. - Mod.ML
