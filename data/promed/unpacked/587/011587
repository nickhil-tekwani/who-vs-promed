We describe the isolation of an NDM-1-producing _Acinetobacter baumannii_ in a Czech patient repatriated in July 2011 from Egypt. The infection spread to another patient on the same ward. Both isolates showed the same resistance pattern and were susceptible only to colistin. They had an identical PFGE [pulse feild gel electrophoresis] pattern and belonged to the same sequence type ST 1. Sequencing of the blaNDM gene identified the NDM-1 variant of the carbapenemase, surrounded by two copies of insertion sequence ISAba125.

The index patient was hospitalized in Egypt, and then transferred to a hospital in the Czech Republic. The patient developed ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by _A. baumannii_ in addition to a primary neurological diagnosis. A carbapenem-resistant _A. baumannii_ strain (V509) was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage and an oral cavity swab. He was initially treated by meropenem and metronidazole. Due to progression of the primary disease, the patient was transferred to a long term intensive care unit (ICU). Although the antibiotic regimen was not changed, the patient recovered according to the biochemical markers of inflammation within 7 days and the antibiotic therapy was then stopped. The available data are not conclusive as to whether this patient was infected or colonized. However, the resistant isolate has been detected in low quantity in oral swab and bronchoalveolar lavage until the transfer to the long term ICU. The ICU was informed about the epidemiological risk associated with this patient so that they could prepare for appropriate measures upon transfer.

A second _A. baumannii_ isolate (V566) with the same resistance pattern was recovered 6 days later from the airways of another ventilated patient sharing the same room. The patient was treated with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, and ciprofloxacin. He died due to respiratory failure 4 days after the 1st isolation of NDM-1-producing _A. baumannii_.

Laboratory analysis
-------------------
The isolates from both patients were identified as _A. baumannii_ by biochemical testing and by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to 14 antibiotics were tested and the results were interpreted according to the EUCAST recommendation (1). The isolates from both patients were resistant to all beta-lactams tested including carbapenems and other antibiotics (Table, see URL above. - Mod.LL]).

Typing performed by PFGE (2) showed that the isolates had indistinguishable macrorestriction patterns. Carbapenemase production was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (3). Production of metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL) activity was verified by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) double-disk synergy test (4).

The blaNDM gene of both isolates was amplified and sequenced as described previously [5], and revealed the NDM-1 variant of the enzyme. The blaNDM-1 together with other genes was located between two copies of the insertion sequence ISAba125 in the same orientation as found by Pfeifer and colleagues [6]. Because plasmid preparations from the two isolates did not yield any plasmids visible after electrophoretic separation, and no transformants were obtained after transformation experiments performed as previously described [7], it can be hypothesised that blaNDM-1 is located on the bacterial chromosome.

Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was performed [8] and the MLST database available at the website of the Pasteur Institute was used to assign the sequence type (ST). Both isolates belonged to sequence type (ST) 1 (allelic profile 1-1-1-1-5-1-1) which represents the epidemiologically successful European clone I [9].

Discussion and conclusion
-------------------------
Reports describing NDM-type carbapenemase producers isolated from patients previously hospitalised in high-prevalence countries have been increasing. Pfeifer and colleagues detected NDM-1 in _A. baumannii_ isolated from a patient repatriated to Germany from Serbia in 2007 [6]. Importation of NDM-1-producing _A. baumannii_ strain from Serbia has also been described by Poirel and colleagues [10]. Other _A. baumannii_ isolates expressing NDM-1 MBL have been isolated in China and India [11,12]. It is remarkable that blaNDM-1 was also found on a plasmid in _A. lwoffii_ in China [13]. The new NDM-2 variant was first detected in _A. baumannii_ from a patient transferred from Egypt to Germany [5]. Recently, clonal spread of NDM-2-producing _A. baumannii_ strains have been described in a rehabilitation ward in Israel and in the United Arab Emirates [14,15].

Until this report, no NDM-1 producing bacterium had been described in the Czech Republic, a country with a low prevalence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria [16-18]. Although routine procedures were in place in the hospital department, the strain quickly spread within one ward to another patient. After the death of the second patient and the transfer of the first patient to the long term ICU, the department was closed for 2 weeks and general cleaning including decontamination of all equipment was undertaken. No NDM-1-producing strain has been detected after the cleaning. Due to the importance of international travel in the spread of bacterial resistance, fast detection and active surveillance of bacteria producing acquired carbapenemases is needed [5-7,10,16,18,19].

We also tested the new MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry approach [3] for the detection of carbapenemase activity in the isolates. Although phenotypical detection of carbapenem-hydrolyzing enzymes in _A. baumannii_ seems to be difficult by conventional methods [20], we were able to see a clear carbapenemase activity by this assay. Further validation, however, is necessary.
