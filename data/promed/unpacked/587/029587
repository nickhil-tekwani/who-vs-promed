Earthquake-hit Haiti escaped a fresh disaster threatened by Hurricane
Tomas, but the storm caused flooding that killed 8 people and
increased the contagion threat from a deadly cholera epidemic, the
government and aid workers said on Sat 6 Nov 2010.

Amid widespread relief that the hurricane largely spared crowded
camps in the Haitian capital housing 1.3 million quake survivors, the
international humanitarian operation was turning its attention back
to the 2-week-old epidemic, which has killed just over 500 people and
sickened more than 7000.

"We do expect the infection rate to jump up due to the flooding and
to the bad sanitation conditions in many areas," Christian Lindmeier,
spokesman in Haiti for the Pan American Health Organization/World
Health Organization, told Reuters. "Cholera is a water-borne disease,
and so additional water means additional risk," said Lindmeier. Tomas
skirted Haiti on Friday [5 Nov 2010], flooding some coastal towns,
forcing thousands from their homes and soaking camps for displaced
people in the capital Port-au-Prince with rain.

The cholera epidemic, which has affected 5 of Haiti's provinces,
still appeared to be spreading. Haiti's health ministry released
updated figures showing 501 people had died through 4 Nov 2010, up
from 442 on 3 Nov 2010.

[These morbidity and mortality figures for cholera are through 4 Nov
2010, the day prior to Tomas' dumping of 5-10 inches of rain on
Haiti. It is overwhelmingly likely that there will be a significant
ramping up of cholera cases following the wake of the storm. Such
flooding, in the midst of cholera breaking out in a location with
poor access to clean water, can be a perfect storm for the release of
the Pale Horseman upon this stricken land. - Mod.LL]

The Nepal Army (NA) on Thursday [4 Nov 2010] said that allegations
against UN peacekeepers from Nepal currently deployed at a Nepalese
peacekeeping base at Miraebalasis in Haiti as the source of a cholera
outbreak have been proved wrong.

Issuing a press statement, NA's Directorate of Public Relations (DPR)
said investigations conducted by UN investigators and the Nepalese
"contingent" confirmed that tests of water samples from the military
camp were negative for cholera.

"An investigation conducted by collecting and testing water samples
and waste from the military camp of Mirebalais confirmed that the
tests proved to be negative," states the press release issued by DPR.
There have been allegations that the Nepalese peacekeeping mission at
Mirebalais was the source of a cholera epidemic in Haiti.

"We have an official policy not to deploy unhealthy soldiers in
peacekeeping missions," states the press release, adding, "We don't
allow anyone in a peacekeeping mission without a health check."

The DPR also clarified that no symptoms of cholera were found in
Nepali peacekeepers during their health check up following the
allegation that they are the source of the epidemic. "All the
Nepalese peace keepers had their health checked up instantly after
the allegations. The investigation did not find any evidence that
Nepalese peace keepers were the source of the cholera; there is no
evidence that the disease has been caused or carried by Nepalese
peacekeepers," the statement points out.

"Following additional tests of water samples from the military camp
of Mirebalais concluded one week ago, the UN Mission in Haiti
(MINUSTAH) can now confirm that the tests were analyzed by an
independent laboratory and proved negative," Martin Nesirky,
spokesperson of UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, said. The latest
test followed previous ones conducted on 22 and 26 Oct 2010, which
also proved negative.

Asked about UN efforts to determine whether its peacekeepers have
cholera, Nesirky said that all the soldiers in the Nepalese
contingent underwent all necessary medical tests and were found
innocent of the allegations. "If they had diarrhea or any other
cholera-related symptom, they would have undergone further tests,
including for cholera. But none of them had to do that, as they were
all healthy and remain that way now," Nesirky said.

[The source whereupon _V. cholerae_ was introduced into Haiti is
still not clear. Not to cast further aspersions on the Asian
peacekeepers, but the water testing was done after the outbreak was
established, and if there was a transiently infected individual, by
the time that the water was tested, the carriage may have ceased.
Clearly, many infected individuals are not affected, and the
peacekeepers were not cultured per se. Long term carriage of cholera
is rare but not unknown. - Mod.LL]
