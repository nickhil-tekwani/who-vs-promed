MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM
It was in 1885 that Daniel E. Salmon, U.S. veterinary surgeon, discovered
the first strain of _Salmonella_. Today, there are 2213 known strains and
the book is not closed. Over the years, antibiotic resistant strains have
developed that are difficult to control and there is a body of evidence in
the scientific literature suggesting the possibility that some of these
strains may have emerged due to use of antibiotics in intensive anima
husbandry. Recent years saw a dramatic rise both in terms of incidence and
severity of cases of human salmonellosis; compared to 1980 some countries
in Europe witnessed a staggering 20-fold increase in incidence in the last
10 - 15 years. Where the epidemic has been further studied, the majority of
cases has been caused by strains or, more correctly, serotypes of
_Salmonella enteritidis_ and _Salmonella typhimurium_. The bad news is
that since the beginning of the 1990s, strains of _S. typhimurium_, which
are resistant to a range of antibiotics, have emerged and are threatening
to become a serious public health problem. This is part of a general
trend. The incidence of bacterial resistance has increased at an alarming
pace in recent years and is expected to continue rising at a similar or
even greater rate in the future as antimicrobial agents or antibiotics
lose their effectiveness.
SALMONELLOSIS
Transmission: Salmonellosis in humans is contracted mainly through the
consumption of raw or undercooked contaminated food of animal origin
(mainly meat, poultry, eggs and milk) , although many other foods have been
implicated in its transmission. The causative organisms pass through the
food chain from primary production or through cross-contamination from
food products in households or food-service establishments and institutions
such as hospitals. In developed countries human to human transmission is
uncommon but can occur, notably in institutions, for instance special-care
baby units and residential homes for the elderly. Little is known about the
epidemiology in developing countries but spread within hospitals and
health centres has been reported.
A total of 2213 different _Salmonella_ strains have been identified.
Epidemiologically, they can be classified according to their adaptation to
human and animal hosts:
Group 1, e.g. _Salmonella typhi_ and _Salmonella paratyphi_, causes enteric
fever only in humans and in higher primates. Group 2 causes disease in
certain animals: _Salmonella dublin_ in cattle, _Salmonella cholerae-suis_
in pigs, but only infrequently in humans. However, when these strains do
cause disease in humans, it is often invasive and can be life-threatening.
Group 3 includes the remaining strains. Typically, such strains cause
gastroenteritis which is often mild and self-limiting but can be severe
in the young, the elderly, and patients with weakened resistance against
infectious diseases. This group features _Salmonella enteriditis_ and
_Salmonella typhimurium_, the two most important strains for salmonellosis
(transmitted from animals to humans).
The clinical course of human salmonellosis is usually characterized by
acute onset of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea and sometimes
vomiting. In some cases, particularly in the very young and in the elderly,
dehydration can become severe and life threatening. Antibiotic treatment
is necessary in less than 2% of the clinical cases. Serious complications
occur in a small proportion of cases. The incidence is particularly high in
children and the elderly accounting for up to 60% of all reported
laboratory confirmed cases. Studies in developed countries indicate that
more than 80% of all salmonellosis cases occur individually rather than as
outbreaks.
Cost estimates per reported case of human salmonellosis range from US$
1,000 to $1,300 in North America and Europe. The annual cost of
salmonellosis in the United States of America is estimated to total almost
US $4,000 million. The United Kingdom Food and Drink Federation calculated
in its 1994 report that foodborne illness, principally salmonellosis, is
costing the British economy about UKÂ£ 1,000 million annually. The costs
associated with individual outbreaks in North America and Europe ranged
from around US$ 60,000 to more than US$ 20 million.
SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM
_Salmonella typhimurium_ can be found in a broad range of species as well
as the environment. Together with _Salmonella enteritidis_, it causes the
overwhelming majority of cases of zoonotic salmonellosis in many countries.
Because of their predominance, it is necessary to discriminate between
the various serotypes in the course of epidemiological investigations and
a fairly sophisticated technique called phage typing is used for this
purpose in many countries.
EMERGENCE OF MULTI-DRUG RESISTANT SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM DT 104
Multi-drug resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 initially emerged in
cattle in 1988 in England and Wales. Subsequently, the strain has been
isolated from poultry, sheep, pigs, and horses. Antimicrobial therapy is
used extensively to combat Salmonella typhimurium infection in animals. The
evolution of a strain resistant to the commonly-used antibiotics has made
infections with _Salmonella typhimurium_ in food animals difficult to
control and it will likely remain an animal health problem for quite some
time. To make things even worse, a particular variant of _Salmonella
typhimurium_, rather awkwardly called R-type ACSSuT, has developed
multiple drug resistance as an integral part of the genetic material of
the organism. Unlike other salmonella strains, multiresistant _Salmonella
typhimurium_ DT 104 is therefore likely to retain its drug resistance
genes even when antimicrobial drugs are no longer used.
EPIDEMIOLOGY AND TRANSMISSION
The primary route by which humans acquire infection is by consumption of
contaminated food of animal origin. Unlike Salmonella enteritidis which is
mainly associated with poultry and eggs, multi-drug resistant _Salmonella
typhimurium_ DT 104 can be found in a broad range of foodstuffs. Outbreaks
in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have been
linked to poultry, a variety of meats and meat products, and unpasteurized
milk. In addition to acquiring infection from contaminated food, human
cases have also occurred where individuals have had contact with infected
cattle. A small proportion of cases may have contracted infection from pets
such as cats and dogs, which can also be infected with this strain of
_Salmonella_. Pets probably acquire the infection like humans, in other
words through consumption of contaminated raw meat, poultry or
poultry-derived products.
The evolution of specific salmonella serotypes in intensive animal
husbandry and subsequently in humans has been observed over the last three
decades. The most recent epidemic was caused by _Salmonella enteritidis_,
which peaked in humans in 1992 in many European countries. Its current
slight decline sets the scene for re-emergence of _Salmonella typhimurium_
as - epidemiologically - the most important serotype in human
salmonellosis. Another possible scenario is that these two particular
strains of epidemic potential will dominate in many countries within
foreseeable future.
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION
England and Wales: The disease reporting system in England and Wales has
revealed a ten-fold increase in the number of human cases of multi-drug
resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 in the six year period 1990-1996
going from 300 to 3,500 cases per year. This specific strain is second
only to Salmonella enteriditis as the most common salmonella in humans in
England and Wales in 1995 and more than 55% of cases of Salmonella
typhimurium in humans were caused by the muilti-drug resistant DT 104. It
has worked out stable resistance to some of the most common antibiotics:
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline.
Since 1994, an increasing number of isolates with additional resistance to
trimethoprim and a few with additional resistance to ciprofloxacin have
been reported. Infection with multi-drug resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_
DT 104 has been associated with hospitalization rates which are twice that
of other zoonotic food-borne salmonella infections and with ten times
higher case-fatality rates.
Other countries: An increase in overall number and percentage of multi-drug
resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 is also reported from other
European countries. In Germany, it accounted for up to 10% in more than 10
000 salmonella samples from human sources examined in 1995; and 18% of
those examined in 1996. Almost all DT 104 isolates were multi-drug
resistant with the same resistance pattern as in England and Wales,
although resistance to ciprofloxacin has not yet been observed.
_Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 was recently detected in the United States
but little is known about its prevalence and means of transmission.
Preliminary evidence suggests that DT 104 may have spread widely in the
United States during the past two to three years which may result in a
marked increase in human illness in the near future. Over the past three
decades, practically all countries in Europe have reported sharp rise in
salmonellosis incidence. The same pattern could be observed in a number of
countries in the Middle East and South-East Asia.
CONCLUSIONS
The emergence of _Salmonella_ strains that are resistant to commonly used
antibiotics is important to clinicians, microbiologists and those
responsible for the control of communicable disease and to the food
industry. It is also important to farmers who may sustain economic losses
when consumer confidence in their products is lost. Control of multi-drug
resistant _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104 requires reducing infection in
food animals and lowering the risk of contamination at all stages in the
food production chain. In addition, the avoidance of unnecessary
antibiotic usage in food animals should be combined with good husbandry,
good abattoir practice and good hygiene at all stages in the food
production chain from processing plants to kitchens and food service
establishments.
Existing knowledge and technology cannot be used to provide consumers with
pathogen-free raw meat and poultry, and it is very unlikely that the
eradication of salmonellas in domestic animals is possible in the
foreseeable future. Educating farmers and their families regarding the
risks of occupationally acquired infections is also an important step in
the control of human infections from _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT 104.
