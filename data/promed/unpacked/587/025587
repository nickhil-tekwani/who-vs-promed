Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (Inf. with) (non-poultry including wild birds) (2017-), Canada
------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 9 Dec 2021
Confirmed: 20 Dec 2021
Reported: 22 Dec 2021
Reason for notification: recurrence
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Avalon Peninsula, St John's Division No 1, Newfoundland and Labrador
Started: 9 Dec 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 419 / 360 / 360 / 59 / - / -

Affected population: The site is an exhibition farm with multiple bird species (chicken, turkeys, emus, geese, ducks, guinea fowl and peafowl) as well as multiple mammalian species. The geographic coordinates do not represent the actual location of the premises.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, contact with wild bird.

Epidemiological comments: The infected premises is an exhibition farm located on an island off the Atlantic coast of Canada. A protection zone (3km) [about 1.86mi] and a surveillance zone (10 km) [about 6.2mi] have been put in place around the infected premises. The virus has HA cleavage site motif "PLREKRRK/GLF" consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza strains of H5 subtype. The HA gene segment is A/goose/Guangdong/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage belonging to 2.3.4.4B clade. Phylogenic analysis indicates this virus corresponds to the Eurasian lineage circulating in 2021. Wildlife surveillance as well as the Canadian Avian Influenza Surveillance System (CanNAISS) activities for poultry are ongoing in Canada. According to article 10.4.1.4 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, member countries should not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notification of infection with any Influenza A viruses in birds other than poultry.

Control measures applied in domestic: traceability; stamping out; quarantine; zoning; surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone

Control measures to be applied in domestic: disinfection; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Control measures applied in wild: surveillance within containment and or the protection zone; surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone

"The infected birds were located on an exhibition farm; the detection is considered a non-poultry detection according to the OIE definition. Canada's animal health status as 'free from AI' remains in place. No trade restrictions are anticipated as a result of this detection".

According to the OIE Terrestrial Code, the definition of poultry, "means all birds reared or kept in captivity for the production of any commercial animal products or for breeding for this purpose, fighting cocks used for any purpose, and all birds used for restocking supplies of game or for breeding for this purpose, until they are released from captivity.

"Birds that are kept in a single household, the products of which are used within the same household exclusively, are not considered poultry, provided that they have no direct or indirect contact with poultry or poultry facilities.

"Birds that are kept in captivity for other reasons, including those that are kept for shows, racing, exhibitions, zoological collections and competitions, and for breeding or selling for these purposes, as well as pet birds, are not considered poultry, provided that they have no direct or indirect contact with poultry or poultry facilities".
