An outbreak of _E. coli_ at Carbon Live Fire Mexican Grill has grown to include 65 people who have become ill, more than double the number initially reported by the Chicago Department of Public Health. The restaurant has locations in Bridgeport and on the North Side. The North Side restaurant has been found by city health inspectors to be "safe" and "clean." The 2 locations share a phone number, and a person answering the phone Thu [14 Jul 2016] morning said the North Side spot is open, and the Bridgeport restaurant remains closed for now.

On 5 Jul 2016, Chicago health officials said the _E. coli_ outbreak affected at least 25 customers and sent at least 5 to the hospital. The health department said the main location in Bridgeport was the outbreak's "focal point," but that the North Side restaurant had been "voluntarily closed." On 9 Jul 2016, the health department said that after inspecting the North Side location, it was "determined that the restaurant was safe, clean and able to meet all requirements for a safe reopening." As of that day, 54 people had been identified as contracting Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ from the outbreak, the department said.

Health department spokesman Matt Smith said on Thu 14 Jul 2016 that 65 cases have been confirmed and tied to Carbon, with 20 people requiring hospitalization.

[The scope and source of this relatively large outbreak is still unclear. In Mexican cuisine, since many dishes include a variety of produce together, it can be difficult to hone in on a source of the pathogen. - Mod.LL
