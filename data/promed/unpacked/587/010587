Saskatoon Health Region officials have confirmed a case of hantavirus infection in the area. The health region says the patient is under medical care. No other details have been provided. It is the 3rd case recorded by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Health in the last 2 months.

The infection is potentially fatal and can develop after humans are exposed to the hantavirus through the droppings, urine or saliva of rodents such as deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. Early symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness and respiratory distress.

Saskatoon Health Region deputy medical health officer Shovita Padhi said hantavirus [infection] symptoms are very similar to "run of the mill flu." Symptoms can appear in as little as 3 days after exposure, though the average is 14 days. "Definitely, please be cognizant of these symptoms," said Padhi.

Padhi said those in rural areas, particularly with known deer mice populations, should be especially vigilant. A visit to a family physician will determine whether someone needs to be tested for the virus. If allowed to progress untreated, hantavirus is fatal in roughly 1/3rd of cases.

[Sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in humans have occurred in Canada's Prairie Provinces and British Columbia for several years. This report does not indicate which hantavirus is involved in this case, but it is likely to be Sin Nombre virus. The circumstances under which the infection occurred are not given.

A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site with extensive information about hantaviruses, including those in North America, with clinical signs, treatment, epidemiology, and an image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at http://www.discoverlife.org/nh/tx/Vertebrata/Mammalia/Muridae/Peromyscus/maniculatus/images/Peromyscus_maniculatus_map.320.jpg.html.
