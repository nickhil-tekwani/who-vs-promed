Russia: research scientist dies of Ebola fever in lab accident
--------------------------------------------------------------
While working with guinea-pigs infected with Ebola virus, a female member
of staff of the Vector State Scientific Centre of Virology and
Biotechnology was accidentally injected. This accident occurred in the
course of a scientific experiment in the Department of Dangerous viral
Pathogens of the Molecular Biology Scientific Research Institute.
The woman scientist was hospitalized in the dangerous infections department
of a special hospital with the greatest possible level of biological
defence. There were constant consultations with Health Ministry specialists
regarding treatment. A doctor who has often been involved in treating
patients with Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Africa was consulted. In spite of
the treatment, the scientist died.
According to the Vector press office, an analysis of clinical materials is
currently underway. The staff who were involved in the treatment and
investigation of the patient will be kept under observation for 21 days:
they will undergo a daily medical examination and twice-daily temperature
measurement.
The Vector State Scientific Centre of Virology and Biotechnology under the
Russian Health Ministry was set up in 1974 to study dangerous virus
pathogens and to develop treatment and diagnostic preparations in the
interests of health care and defence. All viruses, bacteria and microbes
known to be dangerous pathogens have been assembled within its walls.
