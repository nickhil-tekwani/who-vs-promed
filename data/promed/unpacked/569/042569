The following background data on cholera in Taiwan were extracted from
GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>.
Note that this perhaps the third report of _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 in this
country:
Cholera epidemics totaling 11 036 cases were reported in 1912, 1919 to
1920, 1946 and 1962. No autochthonous cases were reported during 1962 to 1997.
No cases were reported in 1988; 1 in 1990; 0 in 1993; 2 (imported) in 1994;
3 (imported) in 1995; 0 in 1996. No cases were reported in 1998.
A single (nonfatal) autochthonous case of _V. cholerae_ O139 infection was
acquired in Likang (Pingtung county) in 1997 - the first reported infection
by this serogroup in Taiwan. An autochthonous case of _V. cholerae_ O139
infection was reported from Taichung in 1999.
