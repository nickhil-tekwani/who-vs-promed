The death of a homemaker March 13, 1997, had baffled doctors until now.
The deceased, a 39-y.o. female from Cresco, has been shown to have died of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), state public health officials
confirmed. She is now the first person in Pennsylvania known to have died
from HPS. A family member said the patient lived in a rural area where
deer mice are common. Deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) are reservoir
hosts of Sin Nombre, an etiologic agent of HPS, and closely related
hantaviruses.
Dr. Andre Weltman, a public health physician in the state Department of
Health's Division of Communicable Diseases, confirmed Thursday that the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta diagnosed the disease in tissue
samples taken from the patient in an autopsy. The case had baffled doctors
until a hunter, a resident of Trexlertown, died in November in
what authorities thought was the state's first case of hantavirus [infection.
After the hunter's death, Dr. Luther Rhodes, chief of infectious diseases
at Lehigh Valley Hospital, asked doctors to examine their records for
similar cases. A Bethlehem forensic pathologist, remembered performing an
autopsy on the woman and had saved the tissue samples.
Only about 10 cases have been reported east of the Mississippi River.
