Did wild game feasts lead to fatal brain disorders?
---------------------------------------------------
Wild game feasts were a fall ritual that drew outdoorsmen to a family cabin
overlooking the Brule River in Wisconsin. The father of the present owner
died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and 2 other participants also died
from rare brain disorders. Now, years later, the legacy of those hearty
spreads of the late 1980s and early '90s is a medical mystery linking these
3 diners.
One by one, the 3 have died from rare brain diseases, leaving their
families and health officials wondering whether their deaths were an eerie
coincidence or evidence that the deer and elk brain disorder known as
chronic wasting disease has crossed the threshold from animals to people.
Either way, their tale is one more warning sign on a cautionary trail
cutting through the heart of one of Wisconsin's most popular and revered
traditions: deer hunting.
Of the 3 deceased, 2 died of CJD, an always-fatal brain ailment that occurs
in only one in a million people. The third was believed to have died of
Pick's disease, a somewhat more common neurological disorder that can be
diagnosed in error when the true culprit is CJD.
Over the years, as many as 100 men may have taken part in the wild game
feeds at the Brule River cabin. The odds are strongly against 2 men dying
of CJD, according to Dennis Maki, a professor of medicine and an infectious
disease expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison; 3 would increase
those odds dramatically."It's very suspicious," he said.
The families of 3 men were devastated and baffled by their deaths, 2 of
which occurred in 1993 and the third in 1999; all before chronic wasting
disease was known to exist in Wisconsin's deer herd.
Raising more suspicion, however, is the fact that some of the meat served
at the wild game feasts was elk and deer from Western states, including
Colorado, where chronic wasting disease has been endemic for decades.
Presented last week with specifics of the cases, state public health
officials expressed concern. "We've immediately decided to proceed with an
investigation," said Jeffrey Davis, chief medical officer and state
epidemiologist for communicable diseases at the Wisconsin Division of
Public Health. He said the state will request death certificates and
clinical and laboratory records for the 3 men.
So far, there has not been a documented case of a person contracting
chronic wasting disease, but a handful of suspicious cases have surfaced in
Wisconsin and around the country, all involving venison eaters who have
contracted CJD, a deadly neurological disorder closely related to mad cow
disease. One of those cases involved a Minneapolis resident who died of CJD
in 1996 at the age of 41. He occasionally ate venison from Wisconsin,
including deer killed in Barron County. There have also been several
documented cases of CJD among people who cooked and ate brains from
squirrels and wild goats.
The human version of mad cow disease, known as new variant CJD [abbreviated
as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail], has killed more than 130 people
in Europe and is believed to be caused by eating contaminated beef.
Scientists who watched mad cow disease jump from animals to humans are now
deeply concerned that chronic wasting disease will make the same leap, if
it hasn't already happened. "We're actively looking for human beings who
have acquired chronic wasting disease," said G. Richard Olds, chairman and
Linda and John Mellowes Professor of Medicine at the Medical College of
Wisconsin.
Chronic wasting disease, mad cow disease and CJD are so-called
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and are believed to be caused by
prions. Prions are mutant proteins that get normal proteins to mimic their
distorted shape, resulting in a buildup of spongelike holes in the brain.
One reason prions are so feared is that they are highly resistant to heat
and other sanitizing methods. In addition, prions may silently incubate for
years or even decades in a person before producing symptoms of disease.
If chronic wasting disease prions were going to infect people, the men who
gathered for the feasts at the Brule River cabin in northwestern Wisconsin
were as likely candidates as any. Several of the men were prolific hunters,
bagging hoofed game in Wisconsin, the western United States, Mexico, and
Canada.
There may be reasons to question the diagnosis in the case of the Pick's
disease patient. It is "highly unusual" for a Pick's patient to die within
a year of the onset of symptoms, Grafman said. The vast majority of
patients die within 2 to 10 years, whereas the patient in question died
slightly less than a year after he first displayed symptoms It's also
unusual for someone to get Pick's after age 60 and this patient died at age
66. More important, the gold standard for diagnosing Pick's disease is to
do an autopsy and a molecular analysis of brain tissue. However, according
to a certificate of death obtained from the state of Nevada, where the
third patient died after being taken to a clinic in Reno for treatment, no
autopsy was performed.
Maki said he believes that if chronic wasting disease spreads among
Wisconsin's deer herd, it's only a matter of time before the disease
spreads to people."We eventually will see cases (in humans)," he said.
However, he predicted the number of cases is likely to remain small and the
risk low.
In 2000, federal government researchers at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories
in Hamilton, Montana, analyzed prions from deer infected with chronic
wasting disease. The analysis showed a substantial molecular barrier that
helped prevent chronic wasting prions from converting normal human protein
to the mutant form. Despite the barrier, deer prions ultimately were able
to convert human protein to the mutant form. They did so with about the
same level of efficiency as mad cow prions.
Maki and others point to a growing body of evidence linking the consumption
of deer or other wild game with CJD. In 1984, neurologists at Baylor
College of Medicine investigated 4 suspicious deaths involving unrelated
patients, all with a history of eating the brains of wild animals. All the
patients eventually died, and CJD was the suspected cause. "Our patients
ate many brains from many wild animals over the course of many years and
therefore could have come in contact with infected material," the
researchers wrote.
In 1986, a study involving 26 CJD patients by researchers at Temple
University and the National Institutes of Health found that exposure to
deer through a hobby such as hunting resulted in up to a 9-fold increased
risk for CJD.
A 1997 study in the journal Lancet linked 5 unrelated CJD patients from
different towns in rural Kentucky to a history of eating squirrel brains.
"Culinary preparations include scrambling the brains with eggs or putting
them in a meat and vegetable stew referred to as 'burgoo,' " the
researchers wrote.
In October 2001, a study in the journal Archives of Neurology reported on
the cases of 3 people who contracted CJD and who had been deer hunters or
had regularly eaten venison. The 3 individuals, who were from Maine,
Oklahoma, and Utah, all were under the age of 30 and came down with the
disease between 1997 and 2000. The vast majority of CJD patients get the
disease in their 60s and 70s. The researchers, some from the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, concluded that although circumstances
suggested a connection with chronic wasting disease, they could find no
"causal link." Now, the cases of the 3 Wisconsin men raise some of the
same questions. Fred Bannister, a small-town doctor who knew all 3 men and
took part in the wild game feeds, said a thorough investigation of the case
is needed.

[The sad truth is that panic has far outrun science, and the lack of
evidence does not help the panic. There is far too little research on a
disease that has existed in the States for more than 50 years. Now because
of BSE and some tests, there is an epidemic of diagnosis, not necessarily
an epidemic of disease, resulting in an epidemic of fear without reason.
With BSE, there is a genetic link, a clear pathological pointer linking BSE
and vCJD. However, no such link exists between vCJD or CJD and CWD.
There appears to be clear evidence that families and the media wish there
to be such a link, but there is no pathological confirmation, only
speculation. (In the cases reported above, perhaps coincidence.) However,
that begs the question: Has the familial form of CJD always been linked to
CWD and we are only now speculating that? - Mod.TG
I agree with my colleague that the absence of hard data in this report and
the excessive amount of speculation make any reasonable evaluation of the
claims problematic in the extreme. - Mod.CP]
