Animal Health Report to the OIE (Follow-up to report of 09/06/1999)
Geographical Location: 4 properties in Waikato region, North Island, New
Zealand
Species code: EQU (Equine)
susceptible: 12
cases: 1
deaths: 0
destroyed: 1
slaughtered: 0
Description of (newly) affected population: No new cases have been detected
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Centre for Disease
Investigation, Wallaceville
Diagnostic test used: AGID (Coggins) test
Causal agent: Equine Infectious Anaemia virus
Source of agent/Origin of infection: A horse imported from New South Wales,
Australia
have been detected.
Other epidemiological details:
The report of 9 June 1999 advised that an imported horse which had tested
positive to equine infectious anaemia (EIA) was destroyed on 8 June 1999.
Trace-back established 11 horses had direct or indirect contact with the
imported case. The horses were on 4 separate properties following movements
of horses in the same consignment as the imported case. Movement
restrictions were imposed on all 4 properties, and the in-contact horses
were isolated and received daily treatment with prophylactic insecticide
sprays. Insect trapping early in the isolation period indicated _Stomoxys
calcitrans_ (the only likely vector in New Zealand) was present, but in
very low numbers.
All isolated horses were tested using the AGID (Coggin's) test at the start
of the isolation period, after 30 days, and after 60 days. All results were
negative for EIA. Although isolation was originally intended to run for 45
days, this period was extended to 60 days on the advice of experts in order
to provide an appropriately conservative level of confidence that a horse
would have seroconverted by the final test, if infected.
Upon completion of testing with negative results, all restrictions on
in-contact horses and their premises have been removed. Stamping out has
been completed, and New Zealand is once again considered free from EIA.
