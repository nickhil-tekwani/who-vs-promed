Emerging pathogen in humans linked to pneumonia in a horse
----------------------------------------------------------------
A bacterium considered an emerging pathogen in humans has been linked to a serious lung infection in a horse in Italy.

The details of the horse's illness are described in a case report just published in the journal BMC Veterinary Research [see reference below].

The 17-year-old saddle horse was found to be infected with _Klebsiella variicola_. The researchers believe it is the 1st time _K. variicola_ has been identified as the cause of respiratory disease in a horse.

The bacterium was first isolated in Mexico in 2004, initially being identified as an endophyte in soil and plants such as bananas, rice, sugar cane, and maize. However, recent studies have identified the micro-organisim as an emerging pathogen in humans.

"It has been isolated [in humans] from many clinical samples, including blood, tracheal aspirates, several types of secretions, as well as the respiratory and urinary tract," Elisabetta Mondo and her colleagues at the University of Bologna noted.

In animals, species of _Klebsiella_ are associated with infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract, and sepsis, while _K. variicola_ has to date been described only in bovine mastitis [see commentary].

The horse at the center of the case study was admitted to the university's Veterinary Teaching Hospital, part of the Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences. It was laboring under respiratory distress and had a fever.

At home, the horse had undergone antibiotic therapy without improvement.

Vital signs on admission revealed an increased respiratory rate, a racing heart, a fever, and weight loss.

Testing revealed a bilateral seropurulent pleural effusion -- pus and fluid on both lungs -- with associated areas of collapsed lung.

A sample of the fluid -- a cloudy yellow colour -- was collected, with testing identifying the presence of _K. variicola_.

The isolate was found to be sensitive to several antimicrobials -- amikacin, cefazolin, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

The horse was treated with oxytetracycline and amikacin, and a tube was inserted in the chest so the fluid could be drained daily.

Despite general health improvement in the horse, and its discharge home, it still retained some fluid on the lung 10 weeks later.

The authors noted the similarities between _K. pneumoniae_ and _K. variicola_, leading to potential misidentification. Indeed, several researchers have estimated that around 10% of _K. pneumoniae_ isolated in human infections are actually misidentifications of _K. variicola_.

"Correct identification of _K. variicola_ is of the utmost importance because this new bacterium may be a pathogenic agent in the animals like it is classified as an important human pathogen," the study team wrote.

Correct identification will also aid in the use of appropriate antimicrobial therapies, which is fundamental for the animal's healing and the prudent use of antibiotics.

"In line with our findings, _K. variicola_ isolates are broadly antimicrobial susceptible and have lower antibiotic resistance rates than other _Klebsiella_ species. Nevertheless, lower antibiotic resistance rates do not necessarily correlate with better treatment outcomes in _K. variicola_ infections.

"Further efforts should be performed to differentiate _K. variicola_ from _K. pneumoniae complex_ since adequate identification of _K. variicola_ is not routinely performed in clinical specimens and its real incidence is unknown.

"The use of new methods for bacterial identification will probably lead to the isolation of a greater number of strains that will widen knowledge on the pathogenic power and diffusion, as well as on the clinical importance and relevance of _K. variicola_ in human and animal infection."

The authors suggest that misidentification between _K. pneumoniae_ and _K. variicola_ has probably reduced awareness about the latter and its possible role in diseases in animals.

"Probably due to the poor isolation rate, its role is not clear in animals, while it has been demonstrated to be an emerging human pathogen.

"Further studies will be needed to understand the spread and the virulence pattern of _K. variicola_ in veterinary medicine."

The _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ complex is a member of the _Klebsiella_ genus of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Recently, the taxonomy of the _K. pneumoniae_ complex has expanded, comprising several taxa, including the subspecies _K. variicola_. All the members of this complex possess overlapping biochemical and phenotypic features; thus, classifying them by traditional microbiological methods is not practicable.

_Klebsiella_ are opportunistic pathogens that are frequently isolated from various infections in animals and humans. In humans, _Klebsiella_ spp. causes infections mainly in hospitalized patients (= nosocomial cases). In animals, infections of the urinary tract, respiratory tract and sepsis are the most common clinical manifestations. _Klebsiella_ species are well-documented causes of mastitis in cattle, metritis in mares, and can cause serious infections in other animals including dogs, rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, muskrats, and birds. It may be expected that improved differentiation of the isolates will lead to additional diagnoses of _K. variicola_ infections in various animal species and organs, hitherto attributed to _K. pneumoniae_.

The Horsetalk report is titled "Emerging pathogen in humans linked to pneumonia in a horse"; the term "linked" may be erroneously interpreted by readers as indicative of a zoonotic event, which, in reference to an opportunistic pathogen, is not the case.
