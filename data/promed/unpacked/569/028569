The Director of Health Services, [Ministry of Health, Republic of Gambia], is asking for the use of paracetamol to be suspended. They recommend "crossing of paracetamol tables," possibly supposed to read "crushing of paracetamol tablets."

Furthermore, there may be an _E. coli_ strain involved in the situation and possible contamination of the paracetamol syrup. [This may be why they are suggesting the use of crushed paracetamol tablets. - Mod.TG]

1st National Situational Report on acute kidney injuries:
The cases were reported from Western 1, Western 2, Lower River Region, and Central River Region.

They had also called for a stop in the distribution of paracetamol syrup, but the Facebook post got deleted, possibly due to an error in the date: it said 10 Aug 2022 instead of 10 Sep [2022].

It said, in part, "Due to the serious nature of the situation, the MCA [Medicines Control Agency] urges all importers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers of all brands of paracetamol syrups to be put under quarantine with immediate effect and to stop their distributions and sale whilst investigation is ongoing."

[This situation is most unfortunate and heartbreaking. We are saddened by the loss of life and the problems caused by a potentially contaminated drug.

An _E. coli_ strain affecting the kidneys would make more sense than the paracetamol syrups causing kidney failure. However, if the contamination is something that causes kidney failure, then the syrup may be the only vehicle of delivering the potential contaminant. Recall that usually paracetamol causes liver failure in high doses, not kidney failure. But perhaps there is a contaminant in the syrup affecting the kidneys.

We look forward to hearing what the cause of the problem is. ProMED would welcome information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.TG]

[The Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=482409953887672&set=pcb.482410170554317), dated 8 Aug 2022, says that "Over 35 cases were reported, while only 32 met the event based case definition with 28 deaths (CFR=87.5%)." The "event case definition: Any child less than 5 years of age with sudden failure to pass urine for more than a day with any of the following: fever, diarrhoea or vomiting from the 24th June 2022 to date." The cases were reported from Western 1, Western 2, Lower River Region and Central River Region. An investigation start date is 19 Jul 2022. The "homes of 8 case patients were visited to collect detailed information on patients in 4 health regions." "National Public Health Laboratory is conducting test on Urine and stool samples. Blood and drug samples were sent to Centre Anti-Poison du Senegal Hospital de Fann."

The "UPDATE ON THE MANAGEMENT", dated 7 Sep 2022, from Dr. Mustapha Btittaye, Director of Health Services, Ministry of Health, states the investigation is ongoing "on the Acute Kidney Injury outbreak in the country," and "it is now concluded that the possible causes are E. coli and possible toxicity from syrup paracetamol." "We also want all syrup paracetamol be suspended till further notice." (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FcQdA6pXwAAUcjg?format=jpg&name=large)

However, we are not told if there are additional cases or deaths since 8 Aug 2022 and the results of any laboratory tests in this ongoing investigation.

Many thanks to Diego Zendejas from International SOS for supplying the Facebook page and the update on management of the outbreak from Dr. Mustapha Bittaye.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
