The National Institute of Health (NIH) has deployed a team of experts to facilitate the local health authorities in northern Sindh to mount a robust response to the recent on-going HIV outbreak in the province. The team will work closely with the Ministry of Health and other partners.

Moreover, the Field Epidemiology and Disease Surveillance Division (FEDSD) of NIH has issued an advisory regarding the prevention and control of HIV. The aim of the advisory is to alert public health authorities across Pakistan to take necessary steps for prevention and control of HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections propagated by unsafe equipment and syringes as well as blood transfusion.

According to the advisory, more than 700 HIV cases have thus far been detected in Sindh, highlighting gross inadequacies in the healthcare system, especially with regard to infection control practices. "The infection is disproportionately affecting children and while scientific investigations are currently underway to ascertain the causative factors, the involvement of young kids born to HIV-negative mothers points to a significant role being played by poor infection prevention and control practices, injection malpractices, and reuse of contaminated syringes," the Executive Director of NIH Dr Aamer Ikram has flagged in his covering letter to the advisory.

The advisory states that HIV can be transmitted from person to person through unprotected sexual intercourse with an infected partner; from contaminated needles, syringes, and other sharp injecting instruments; from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth and through feeding; and from transfusion of HIV-infected blood and blood products. Once in the bloodstream, the retrovirus infects CD4 cells, resulting in progressive deterioration of the immune system and leading to HIV. A person is said to have AIDS when the infection progresses, dropping the CD4 count to below 200. On average, the time from HIV infection to clinical AIDS is 8 to 10 years though AIDS may manifest in less than two years or be delayed in onset beyond 10 years.

The comprehensive advisory provides definition of confirmed HIV-infected and AIDS cases, as well as ways for prompt diagnosis and effective management and prevention of HIV and AIDS. What protocols to follow for disease surveillance and notification, and risk communication and health education are also listed in the advisory.

[2] Risk of HIV spread
Date: Sun 2 Jun 2019

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/479272-exclusive-the-global-fund-fears-possible-spread-of-hiv-into-general-population-in-pakistan


The Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria [Sat 1 Jun 2019] said that it is worried about a possible spread of HIV into general population in Pakistan as recent outbreak in Ratodero area of Larkana (and many outbreaks before) is just a symptom of a deeper crisis.

"The spread of HIV in Pakistan is worrying. Long time thought to be contained in high risk groups, notably injecting drug users, it is now on the verge of spilling into the general population. Larkana (and the many outbreaks before in Pakistan) is just a symptom of a deeper crisis. There is no reason for panic, but also no justification for denial," said Dr Werner Buehler, Senior Fund Portfolio Manager at the Global Fund in Geneva in response to written queries from The News International.

Responding to queries from The News regarding HIV/AIDS situation in Pakistan and a possible procurement of antiretroviral medicines for HIV infected children in Ratodero area of Pakistan, the Global Fund official confirmed that the fund has started procurement of pediatric antiretroviral therapy (ART/ARVs) medicines for the children infected with HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana, Sindh "through our Rapid Supply Mechanism, after consultation with WHO on the most appropriate regimens."

"We have indeed started procuring paediatric ARV, through our Rapid Supply Mechanism, after consultation with WHO on the most appropriate regimens," Dr Werner Buehler said in his email to this scribe.

Over 742 people including 605 children have so far been tested positive for HIV in Ratodero area of Larkana since [25 Apr 2019], officials of Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP) said, adding that majority of the children (411) were of 2 to 5 years of age while 57 were of less than one year's age.

Following reports of deaths of some children due to HIV/AIDS related co-infections in the Ratodero area of Larkana, World Health Organization (WHO) officials in Pakistan had said that they had requested the Global fund to provide pediatric ART medicines for around 500 children under the age of five years who could not take drug in tablet forms.

SACP Program Manager Dr Sikandar Memon said at the moment, they already had 420 infected with HIV in Sindh who were registered with them and getting ART medicines regularly that were being provided by the Global Fund and added that also started giving ARTs to around 190 newly diagnosed children at Paediatric HIV treatment center in Larkana.

The Global Fund official maintained that they are providing treatment for roughly 15 000 people living with HIV in Pakistan, saying: "We have seen massive increases of numbers of people on ART in the past 4-5 years, mostly due to revised treatment guidelines and expanded and decentralized testing in the drug user community. This is a good development, as individuals on ART can no longer spread the virus and can lead healthy and normal lives."

"But it has financial consequences," said Dr Buehler. "The Global Fund is still the only funding source for ART in Pakistan. There is an urgent need for the Government (of Pakistan) to plan and pay for domestic drug procurement. There is also a need to decentralize HIV service delivery (and testing) as much as possible. Only then can we overcome one of the biggest obstacles to treatment, that is, distance," he added.

Dr Werner Buehler maintained that the Global Fund will continue to support Pakistan's fight against HIV for the foreseeable future. "We try our best to prevent more human suffering, but we do realize that the roughly USD 12 million the Fund spends on HIV in Pakistan per year may not be enough at this stage. We hope that Government finds the resources to intensify the fight."

The Global fund official said media and independent journalism have a major role to play in raising general awareness over the nature of HIV. That supposes that more and more journalists acquire technical knowledge about the epidemic, its causes, its treatment, its prevention, in order to comment critically on the situation and to repeat the right messages at every opportunity.

The team of World Health Organisation that arrived in the country on [Tue 28 May 2019] to probe reasons behind the spread of HIV and investigate from where the virus had travelled to the area, visited the children's treatment centre for HIV/AIDS in Chandka Medical College children's hospital on [Thu 30 May 2019] and inquired the staff about how they handled the patients.

The team asked project manager of Sindh AIDS Control Programme who accompanied them about the facilities and the protocol for treating AIDS patients. On [Fri 31 May 2019], the team members would visit Ratodero taluka hospital to personally observe the ongoing process of blood screening for HIV, said sources.

Before the visit of the healthcare facility, the WHO team held a meeting with Sindh Minister for Health Dr Azra Pechuho and other stakeholders at Darbar Hall to review the overall situation regarding the outbreak of HIV/AIDS in Ratodero and the efforts put in so far to fight the virus.

Olive Morgan, the team leader, told that meeting that the scope of the delegation was to dig out the reasons behind the spread of the deadly disease and also see from where it had travelled to the area.

He said that WHO was ready to help patients suffering from the deadly virus. The participants in the meeting exchanged views and discussed certain proposals as to how best to handle the situation. The delegation also handed over AIDS medicines to the minister.

The minister said that since the outbreak of the virus, the health department had set up blood screening camps in and around Ratodero to test the population and opened treatment centers in hospitals. She termed the situation a 'challenge' and expressed optimism about overcoming it in near future.

The minister accompanied by health officials later visited blood screening centre in Ratodero taluka hospital where she told reporters that the WHO delegates were working on different diseases and they would provide the Sindh government a detailed study report on HIV/AIDS.

She said that both Global Fund and Sindh government were financially contributing towards efforts to combat the virus and "we are planning to systematically and scientifically spend the funds." She claimed a 'drop' in the virus' intensity and said that people were very afraid of the virus.

She said that so far 712 persons had been diagnosed as HIV positive at the blood screening centre at Ratodero and announced that WHO and other stakeholders would help Sindh government in establishing good treatment centers.

She said that during their stay the foreign delegates would interact with different communities, visit blood screening camps and treatment centers and compile a report with the findings and reasons which led to the virus' spread.

Secretary for health Dr Saeed Ahmed Magnejo, Larkana commissioner Saleem Raza Khuhro, project manager of Sindh AIDS Control Programme Dr Sikandar Memon, deputy commissioner, representatives of PPHI, Expanded Programme of Immunisation, and district health officer attended the meeting.

A total of 15, 11 among them children, tested positive for HIV during ongoing blood screening test at Ratodero taluka hospital where 286 persons were screened on [Thu 30 May 2019]. Among them 4 were adults (one male and 3 females) and 11 were children (6 boys and 5 girls), said sources.

Ghulam Yaseen Vessar, deputy director of anti-quackery section of the Sindh Healthcare Commission, sealed 9 healthcare facilities on the outskirts of Larkana after raids.

Mr Vessar said that the health facilities were either run by quacks or their premises were found unfit for being clinics. 3 clinic owners had been warned to rectify shortfalls or face action, he said. So far 189 clinics had been sealed and 61 had been issued warning, he said.

[4] WHO update

WHO supports response to HIV outbreak in Sindh, Pakistan
--------------------------------------------------------
An international team of experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) has arrived in Pakistan to support the response to an outbreak of HIV in Larkana in Sindh province, Pakistan, at the request of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination.

The outbreak was first reported on 25 Apr 2019, and a major HIV screening programme started on 28 Apr 2019. It was expanded on 8 May 2019, with additional health workers being deployed. Testing is ongoing.

So far more than 600 HIV cases have been identified. The majority are among children and young people: more than half those affected are children under the age of 5. This poses a particular challenge. Prior to this outbreak, there were just over 1200 children diagnosed with HIV and receiving antiretroviral treatment in the whole of Pakistan.

On 16 May 2019 local authorities established a new antiretroviral treatment clinic for children in Larkana.

Key tasks for the WHO-led team will include: ascertaining the source of the outbreak and controlling it; providing technical expertise, particularly in the areas of HIV testing, paediatric HIV treatment and family counselling; and ensuring adequate supplies of rapid diagnostic tests and antiretroviral medicines for both adults and children, as well as single-use needles and syringes.

The WHO mission will include experts in emergency response management, epidemiology, HIV clinical care, and infection prevention and control from WHO as well as the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN). The team will work closely with the Ministry and partners, including the Aga Khan University, Pakistan's Field Epidemiology & Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), UNAIDS, and UNICEF in Larkana.

[On 25 Apr 2019, the local administration in Larkana, Sindh province in Pakistan was alerted following diagnosis of 13 HIV positive cases among children in Ratodero taluka of Larkana. A screening camp was established at the taluka's (governing unit) main hospital. Initial HIV testing was done using HIV rapid test kits, which were not WHO pre-qualified. Later screening was expanded to other health facilities at the lower level of health care delivery, including selected Rural Health Centres (RHCs) and Basic Health Units (BHUs). As of 3 Jun 2019, 25 856 people were screened of which 742 (2.9 percent) were found to be HIV positive. Most of the diagnosed cases are children (607, 81 percent), mostly under 5-year-old with an overall very high proportion of children among people tested (https://www.nacp.gov.pk/).

This the 4th reported HIV outbreak in Larkana district since 2003. Risk factors identified were unsafe IV injections during medical practice, unsafe delivery practices, unhygienic control measures, unsafe practices at blood banks, poorly implemented harm reduction programmes, and improper hospital waste management.

The current HIV epidemic in Pakistan is defined as a concentrated epidemic (http://www.emro.who.int/pak/programmes/hiv-aids.html). the epidemic is expanding among injecting drug users, with an estimated prevalence of 20 percent, and their sexual contacts, including male and transgender hijra sex workers, with rates of 2 percent-3 percent and 4 percent, respectively.

Like many developing countries, Pakistan faces elevated risk of HIV transmission as a result of poverty, low literacy, gender-related discrimination, ignorance about modes of transmission and the stigma that prohibits people with risk behaviours from seeking HIV testing or disclosing their HIV positive status. Although the overall prevalence is still less than 1 percent in the adult population, the latest estimates of people living with HIV (PLHIV) is 150 000. In 2018, 21 000 new infections were recorded. In Sindh Province where Larkana district belongs, the HIV/AIDS response is spearheaded by Sindh AIDS Control Program (SACP). The HIV service delivery is limited and mostly focused on key populations (injectable drug users, sex workers) in Karachi and Larkana districts.

The recommendations of the WHO expert mission and national experts on the ground will be helpful in determining the risk factors associated with this outbreak, confirmation of the outbreak (whether this is new or has been going on for some time and detected now) and planning the immediate, medium, and long term activities. - Mod.UBA
