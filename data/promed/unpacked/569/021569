Text of a fax received on 5 March 1998 from Dr R.S. Kimanzi, Director of
Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Development and
Marketing, Nairobi:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: November 1997.
Location No. of outbreaks
Isiolo district 1
Kajiado district 1
Koibatek (South Baringo) district 1
Laikipia district 1
Machakos district 1
Nakuru district 1

Description of affected population: the disease mostly affects exotic breeds
of sheep and their crosses.
Epidemiology: the disease has affected sheep remaining in flooded areas,
mostly plains, for long periods. The unprecedented, long El Nino rains have
led to a prolonged wet environment conducive to vector multiplication.
Control measures during reporting period: flocks in affected areas have been
vaccinated against bluetongue. Translocation of affected flocks from
vector-prone areas has been carried out where applicable.

[The indication that this outbreak is largely confined to "exotic breeds and
their crosses" suggests either a recognition bias or that native sheep have
a high level of routine exposure. - Mod.MHJ
