Viet Nam: in the north, avian influenza may be passing from human to human
-----------------------------------------------
Scientists are warning that the virus which causes bird flu could soon be
able to pass between humans. New evidence seen by Channel 4 News points to
an increased risk of a global flu outbreak because of the way the virus has
started to mutate.
It has killed 52 people in Asia in the last 2 years [2004-2005] and,
despite the slaughter of millions of birds, has not stopped spreading. Now
we've seen a report by World Health Organization scientists [see part (2)
of this post - Mod.CP] which warns that the risk of a global flu outbreak
is increasing.
These are the 1st signs that the avian influenza (H5N1) virus is evolving,
and evolving in ways that make a global pandemic more likely. Deep in
northern Viet Nam, scientists have noticed localized changes in the
patterns of infection. In the lab, they have seen genetic changes [also]
that suggest the virus in northern Viet Nam is different: changes that may
affect how the disease will spread.
Scientists at the World Health Organization monitoring avian flu in South
East Asia say they are seeing what they call a "worrisome development."
Recent cases have started appearing in clusters, and the disease is getting
a little milder, signs, they say, the virus may be adapting to humans:
changing genetically to transmit more easily between people at the cost of
losing a little of its virulence. Professor Maria Zambon, from the Health
Protection Agency, told Channel 4 News: "If you have a virus which is more
virulent for humans, it may be less transmissible. But if the virus is
better able to transmit within humans it may be less virulent."
The genetic changes they have seen in the northern Viet Nam viruses are in
the gene that codes for the spike, a molecule called hemagglutinin, in a
part that controls how well the spike fits into the receptor.
The report we've seen recommends that immediate steps should be taken to
step up surveillance in countries where H5N1 is present, and they say
there's an urgent need for up-to-date information on the genetics of the virus.
Constant monitoring of virus from new victims is the key: the WHO denies
reports south-east Asian countries have failed to provide samples -- Viet
Nam alone has supplied over 100 -- but it does admit it has been hard to
extract virus from many of them, hampering research.
H5N1 is proving to be a virus full of surprises. The original jump from
wild ducks, in which it doesn't cause illness, to domestic chickens, which
it kills, was a genetic leap akin to a jump from a cat to a horse. The leap
from chickens to humans was even bigger.
The nastiest surprise would be what's called reassortment: if a completely
new virus emerged after H5N1 got into someone already infected with
conventional human flu.
So, news today that 3 pigs in Indonesia have tested positive for H5N1 is a
warning. There aren't many pigs in this largely Muslim country, but as a
precaution, pigs are being quarantined and tested before they're slaughtered.
And the news there are signs of genetic shifts [technically, the changes
should be described as "genetic drift" pending further analysis - Mod.CP]
in the virus in northern Viet Nam could affect the plans of some
governments to control a pandemic with vaccines. Many that are now being
stockpiled are based on British research that took a virus from Viet Nam
last year [2004] and genetically engineered it to make it safe. The man who
did that work admits genetic shifts since then could make the stockpiles
redundant.
One final surprise, too. One recent sample from Viet Nam proved to be, in
part, resistant to the drug [a neuraminidase inhibitor? - Mod.CP] mainly
used to treat victims of H5N1. Chances are, it's a one-off -- the patient
was being treated with the drug -- but the WHO scientists warn that if
further samples are found, it would have serious implications indeed.

The assessment which prefaces this document is reproduced below. The
assessment that human-to-human transmission may be occurring in northern
Viet Nam is far from conclusive, and although the virus is undoubtedly
showing increasing sequence diversity, its biological relevance is
debatable. - Mod.CP]

WHO Inter-country consultation - Influenza A/H5N1 in Humans in Asia -
Manila, 6-7 May 2005
-----------------------------------------------
Assessment: Some important epidemiological features of human H5N1
infections occurred in northern Viet Nam during January through April 2005
and appeared to differ in some respects from those seen in 2004 in other
parts of Asia, and in the concurrent period in southern Viet Nam. These
included an increase in the number of case clusters in the north compared
with the south, a prolonged interval between the 1st and last cases in
clusters, detection of sub-clinical infections, an expanded age range of
cases and fewer fatal cases. Investigators were not able to prove that
human-to-human transmission had occurred.
However, they expressed concerns, which were shared by local clinicians,
that the pattern of disease appeared to have changed in a manner consistent
with this possibility.
These differences suggest that the epidemiology of H5N1 infections may be
evolving in Asia. The changes in epidemiological patterns are consistent
with the possibility that recently emerging H5N1 viruses may be more
infectious for humans. Furthermore, sequencing analyses of H5N1 genes from
avian and human H5N1 viruses from several countries suggest that they are
becoming more antigenically diverse and may be forming distinguishable
groupings based on phylogenetic analyses.
While the implications of these epidemiological and virological findings
are not fully clear, they demonstrate that the viruses are continuing to
evolve and pose a continuing and potentially growing pandemic threat. Based
on these concerns and findings, it would be prudent to take increased steps
to improve risk assessment procedures, to strengthen the ability of
affected countries to respond promptly to local outbreaks, to accelerate
control of avian influenza in poultry and to implement or complete pandemic
preparatory actions as soon as is possible, even if current H5N1 outbreaks
in Asia cease or diminish during the summer.
