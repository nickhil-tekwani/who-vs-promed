Agricultural ministry confirms FMD outbreak at Matopi
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture has confirmed an outbreak of Foot & Mouth
Disease (FMD) at Matopi, near Matsiloje, where there was another outbreak
in 2002.
Animal Health and Production deputy director Dr Musa Fanikiso said blood
tests conducted by the Botswana Vaccine Institute (BVI) on Tue, 07 Jan
2003, showed that the blood contained the FMD virus.
Fanikiso said contingency measures have been put in place, and they involve
joint police and BDF control of livestock movement along the border between
Zimbabwe and Botswana.
The Department of Animal Health Production team at Matopi is intensifying
surveillance and carrying out further tests to check the extent of the
spread of the disease and to establish how it entered the area.
Fanikiso said they are sure that the area had been previously free of the
disease, as all diseased livestock were completely destroyed in Matsiloje
last year, leaving the whole area disease-free.
He said the outbreak of FMD could be a result of carelessness by human
beings in handling livestock and meat products and movement of people,
including herdsmen or anyone who has been in contact with infected animals.
However, it is likely that Botswana could be experiencing a spillover
problem of the disease from neighbouring Zimbabwe, where the disease
already exists.
He said currently his team is compiling reports and making recommendations
to present to the government for final implementation of disease
eradication measures.
