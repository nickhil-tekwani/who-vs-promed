I am an epidemiologist working in the Antilles-Guyane Regional
Epidemiologic Unit of the French National Institute for Public Health
Surveillance. I am writing in response to your request for information
about dengue in St Martin:
In effect, a dengue outbreak occurred in 2005 in Guadeloupe (St Martin
belongs to Guadeloupe). It started in July [2005] and reached its maximum
in September. Now [Jan 2006] it is [tapering off].
For the [French] part of St Martin, the number of people who consulted a
general practitioner for suspicion of dengue between July and December
[2005] was estimated to be 335 cases. For the first week in January 2006, 7
confirmed cases (serology) have already been recorded. So the outbreak is
not yet completely finished in St Martin.
You can find more information about the actual dengue outbreaks in
Martinique and Guadeloupe on the following websites:

Situation in the French Antilles [as of 11 Jan 2006]:
Guadeloupe
----------
Since June 2005, epidemiological surveillance data have shown a steady
increase in the number of cases reported each week. In July 2005, the
threshold signaling an epidemic was reached. Between the beginning of July
and the end of December 2005, the network of 50 physicians [participating
in the surveillance program, or 5.5 per cent of all the physicians in
Guadeloupe] reported 1555 suspected clinical cases of dengue. Among the 144
hospitalized cases since the beginning of the epidemic, 28 were severe, and
8 were hemorrhagic cases, all with favorable outcomes.
Among the 2655 serological tests ordered since July 2005 by the island
physicians, 1422 cases of dengue were confirmed. The epidemic is associated
with the circulation of the DEN-4 serotype, which represents almost all of
the isolates (for 99 isolates, there were 95 DEN-4, 2 DEN-2 and 2 DEN-3).
The geographic area most affected up until the end of August 2005 was
southern Basse Terre and the island of St. Martin. Geographic extension
towards northern Basse Terre, Grande Terre, and the eastern islands had
been observed since the beginning of September 2005. Desirade island was
not affected by the epidemic. Certain areas remain active: the northern
islands (St. Martin and St. Barthelemy) and St. Francois, where a case of
hemorrhagic dengue fever [DHF] occurred during the last few weeks.
Indicators showed a peak in the epidemic by the end of September [2005],
since by the middle of October the number of daily cases (reported and
confirmed) had diminished. One estimates that, since the beginning of the
epidemic [in 2005], 7700 persons in Guadeloupe had consulted a local
physician for suspected dengue fever.
Martinique
----------
The threshold for the seasonal recurrence of dengue was reached in mid-June
2005, earlier than usual, and the epidemic threshold had been reached in
the middle of July 2005. Between 1 June 2005 and 5 January 2006, the
network of physicians reported 2279 suspected cases of dengue. Up until
that day, 2672 cases had been confirmed by biological analyses (serology
with reverse transcriptase PCR). This epidemic has been associated with the
co-circulation of the DEN-2 and DEN-4 serotypes. The latter predominates
and represents nearly 3 out of 4 of the isolates collected in 2005 (of 227
isolates, there were 158 DEN-4, 63 DEN-2, and 6 DEN-3).
Extrapolating from the physician network data it is estimated that, since
the beginning of the epidemic, nearly 13 000 people in Martinique have been
infected. The epidemic has extended and intensified to the north part of
the island and exists now throughout the island. The communities most
affected by this epidemic with the greatest cumulative conversion incidence
are those with 1000 to 10 000 inhabitants. These include Carbet, Morne
Vert, Morne Rouge, Fonds-Saint-Denis, and Saint-Joseph.
Since the beginning of the epidemic, 170 people (a third of them children)
have been treated in hospital with dengue. Among these, 37 patients
presented with serious criteria, but only 3 presented with hemorrhagic
dengue [DHF], all with favorable outcomes. In addition, 3 patients died in
the context of a dengue infection.
The peak of the epidemic was attained by the end of September 2005. Since
the beginning of October (week 40 of 2005) a steady decline has been seen
in the surveillance indicators [up through] these past 2 weeks. The number
of confirmed cases is 1/30 of the previous daily cases, which should be a
clear indication that the end of the epidemic has been attained.
Even though the transmission of illness has clearly decreased recently, it
appears to have stopped in certain communities that were initially affected
(Ducos, Le Marin, Case-Pilote, Fond-Saint-Denis, St. Pierre). The disease
remains active in the communities of St. Luce, Trinite and Trois Ilets,
since the number of non-immune arrivals during the holiday period has
likely led to a resurgence in disease propagation.

[In response to the RFI regarding the dengue situation in St. Martin posted
by Dr Neil V Rau in the previous report (20060119.0174), several readers
have promptly provided valuable information. ProMED-mail is grateful for
such proactive attitude from our readers. Apparently a dengue outbreak is
still active, though in a trend towards ending, in St. Martin - Mod.RY]
