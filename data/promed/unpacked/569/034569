[3] COVID-19: Lancet, comment -- Heymann DL, Shindo N
Date: Thu 13 Feb 2020

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30374-3/fulltext


ref: Heymann DL, Shindo N. on behalf of the WHO Scientific and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards. COVID-19: what is next for public health. Published. 13 Feb 2020. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30374-3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The WHO Scientific and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards (STAG-IH), working with the WHO secretariat, reviewed available information about the outbreaks of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on [7 Feb 2020], in Geneva, Switzerland, and concluded that the continuing strategy of containment for elimination should continue, and that the coming 2-3 weeks through to the end of February 2020, will be crucial to monitor the situation of community transmission to update WHO public health recommendations if required.

Genetic analysis early in the outbreak of COVID-19 in China revealed that the virus was similar to but distinct from, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), but the closest genetic similarity was found in a coronavirus that had been isolated from bats (1). As there was in early January 2020, scarce information available about the outbreak, knowledge from outbreaks caused by the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) formed the basis for WHO public health recommendations in mid-January 2020 (2). However, the availability of more evidence in the past month has shown major differences between the outbreaks and characteristics of COVID-19 compared with those of SARS-CoV.

Recognising the Wuhan-focused and nationwide outbreak responses in China, WHO has encouraged countries with heavy air travel exchange with Wuhan to take precautionary public health measures (2) and, if there is imported infection, to undertake activities that could lead to the elimination of the virus in human populations as occurred during the 2003 SARS outbreak (3). After the SARS outbreak, a few follow-on outbreaks occurred, including accidents in laboratories researching SARS-CoV (4). SARS-CoV is thought to have been eliminated from human populations during 2003, and there have been no reports in the medical literature about SARS-CoV circulation in human populations since then.

The 2003 SARS outbreaks are thought to have originated from the spillover of a mutated coronavirus from animals sold in a live animal market in Guangdong province in China to a few humans, and it then surfaced as a large cluster of pneumonia in healthcare settings in Guangdong province (5). Although the causative agent was then unknown, an infected medical doctor who had been treating patients in Guangdong province travelled to Hong Kong when he became ill and became an index case for hospital-associated and community outbreaks in Hong Kong and in 3 countries outside of China. The causative agent was later identified as a coronavirus and named SARS-CoV. The SARS outbreaks were at times characterised by several superspreading events -- such as, hotel-based transmission from one infected hotel guest to others who travelled to Canada, Singapore, and Viet Nam (6). One large apartment complex-based outbreak of SARS was later found to be caused by aerosolisation of virus contaminated sewage (6).

COVID-19 is thought to have been introduced to human populations from the animal kingdom in November or December 2019, as suggested by the phylogeny of genomic sequences obtained from early cases (7). The genetic epidemiology suggests that from the beginning of December 2019, when the 1st cases were retrospectively traced in Wuhan, the spread of infection has been almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission, not the result of continued spillover. There was massive transmission in a matter of weeks in Wuhan, and people in the resulting chains of transmission spread infection by national and international travel during the Chinese New Year [25 Jan 2020] holidays.

COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS-CoV. COVID-19 replicates efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and appears to cause less abrupt onset of symptoms, similar to conventional human coronaviruses that are a major cause of common colds in the winter season (8). Infected individuals produce a large quantity of virus in the upper respiratory tract during a prodrome period, are mobile, and carry on usual activities, contributing to the spread of infection. By contrast, transmission of SARS-CoV did not readily occur during the prodromal period when those infected were mildly ill, and most transmission is thought to have occurred when infected individuals presented with severe illness, thus possibly making it easier to contain the outbreaks SARS-CoV caused, unlike the current outbreaks with COVID-19 (6).

COVID-19 also has affinity for cells in the lower respiratory tract and can replicate there, causing radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract lesions in patients who do not present with clinical pneumonia (8). There seem to be 3 major patterns of the clinical course of infection: mild illness with upper respiratory tract presenting symptoms; non-life-threatening pneumonia; and severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that begins with mild symptoms for 7-8 days and then progresses to rapid deterioration and ARDS requiring advanced life support (WHO EDCARN clinical telephone conference on COVID-19, personal communication with Myoung-don Oh [Seoul National University Hospital] and Yinzhong Shen [Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center]).

The case fatality ratio with COVID-19 has been difficult to estimate. The initial case definition in China included pneumonia but was recently adjusted to include people with milder clinical presentation and the current estimate is thought to be about 1-2%, which is lower than that for SARS (10%) (9). The actual case fatality ratio of infection with COVID-19 will eventually be based on all clinical illness and at the time of writing information on subclinical infection is not available and awaits the development of serological tests and serosurveys.

Presently COVID-19 seems to spread from person to person by the same mechanism as other common cold or influenza viruses -- that is, face to face contact with a sneeze or cough, or from contact with secretions of people who are infected. The role of faecal-oral transmission is yet to be determined in COVID-19 but was found to occur during the SARS outbreak (10).

The lock-down of Wuhan City seems to have slowed international spread of COVID-19; however, the effect is expected to be short-lived (WHO modelling group). Efforts are currently underway in China, in the 24 countries to which infected persons have travelled, and in public conveyances, such as cruise ships, to interrupt transmission of all existing and potential chains of transmission, with elimination of COVID-19 in human populations as the final goal. This WHO-recommended strategy is regularly assessed each week by STAG-IH on the basis of daily risk assessments by WHO as information becomes available from outbreak sites.

A plausible scenario based on the available evidence now is that the newly identified COVID-19 is causing, like seasonal influenza, mild and self-limiting disease in most people who are infected, with severe disease more likely among older people or those with comorbidities, such as diabetes, pulmonary disease, and other chronic conditions. Health workers and carers are at high risk of infection, and health-care-associated amplification of transmission is of concern as is always the case for emerging infections. People in long-term care facilities are also at risk of severe health consequences if they become infected.

Non-pharmaceutical interventions remain central for management of COVID-19 because there are no licensed vaccines or coronavirus antivirals. If the situation changes towards much wider community transmission with multiple international foci, the WHO strategy of containment for elimination could need to be adjusted to include mitigation strategies combined with the following activities currently recommended by STAG-IH on the WHO website.

First, close monitoring is needed of changes in epidemiology and of the effectiveness of public health strategies and their social acceptance.

Second, continued evolution is needed of enhanced communication strategies that provide general populations and vulnerable populations most at risk with actionable information for self-protection, including identification of symptoms, and clear guidance for treatment seeking.

Third, continued intensive source control is needed in the epicentre in China -- that is, isolation of patients and persons testing positive for COVID-19, contact tracing and health monitoring, strict health facility infection prevention and control, and use of other active public health control interventions with continued active surveillance and containment activities at all other sites where outbreaks are occurring in China.

Fourth, continued containment activities are needed around sites outside China where there are infected people and transmission among contacts, with intensive study to provide information on transmissibility, means of transmission, and natural history of infection, with regular reporting to WHO and sharing of data.

Fifth, intensified active surveillance is needed for possible infections in all countries using the WHO-recommended surveillance case definition (11).

Sixth, preparation for resilience of health systems in all countries is needed, as is done at the time of seasonal influenza, anticipating severe infections and course of disease in older people and other populations identified to be at risk of severe disease.

Seventh, if widespread community transmission is established, there should then be consideration of a transition to include mitigation activities, especially if contact tracing becomes ineffective or overwhelming and an inefficient use of resources. Examples of mitigation activities include cancelling public gatherings, school closure, remote working, home isolation, observation of the health of symptomatic individuals supported by telephone or online health consultation, and provision of essential life support such as oxygen supplies, mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment.

Eighth, serological tests need to be developed that can estimate current and previous infections in general populations.

Finally, continued research is important to understand the source of the outbreak by study of animals and animal handlers in markets to provide evidence necessary for prevention of future coronavirus outbreaks.

[I have reproduced the entire commentary (except references which are available at the source URL above) because this is an excellent overview of where we have been, where we are, and where we may be going with respect to the identification of the COVID-19 outbreak, recommended containment measures, and future containment vs. mitigation measures. This has been a moving scale watching the fairly rapid explosion of the outbreak in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, to importation of cases in 24 other countries, and the slow but present local transmission in countries such as Japan, Singapore, and especially on the cruise ship quarantined off Yokohama, Japan.

It is clear that reassessment on a regular basis is warranted with a willingness to change strategies if indicated. - Mod.MPP]

The epidemiological characteristics of an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) -- China, 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei Province China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive, explanatory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of [11 Feb 2020].

Methods
All COVID-19 cases reported through [11 Feb 2020] were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System.
Analyses included the following:
1. summary of patient characteristics;
2. examination of age distributions and sex ratios;
3. calculation of case fatality and mortality rates;
4. geo-temporal analysis of viral spread;
5. epidemiological curve construction; and 6. subgroup analysis.

Results
A total of 72 314 patient records -- 44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10 567 (14.6%) clinically diagnosed cases (Hubei Province only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%) -- contributed data for the analysis.

Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%) and considered mild (80.9%). diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild (80.9%). A total of 1023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei Province sometime after December 2019, and by [11 Feb 2020], 1386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked around [23-26 Jan 2020], then began to decline leading up to 11 Feb 2020. A total of 1716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%).

Conclusions
COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly taking only 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.

[This is the 1st large study of all confirmed cases of COVID-2 reported to the Chinese National Health Information System as of 11 Feb 2020.

Additional details in the method section that clarifies the presentation of results are noteworthy. In classifying clinical presentation, the authors defined cases as mild, severe, or critical. Mild were those whose clinical course was either non-pneumonia or a mild pneumonia. Severe included those who had dyspnea (shortness of breath), respiratory rate greater than or equal to 30 per minute, a blood oxygen saturation of less than or equal to 93%, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio (the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen) of 50% within 24-48 hours. Critical cases were defined as individuals with respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multi-organ dysfunction or failure. Health workers included all individuals working in a healthcare facility, not just doctors and nurses. Of note, the variables Wuhan-related exposure, comorbid condition, and case severity were not mandatory reporting fields, so information was not available on all reported cases.

Date of onset was self-described date of onset of either fever or cough. For asymptomatic cases, the date of positive viral nucleic acid test results was taken as date of onset for purposes of the epidemic curves in the paper. Suspected cases were those who were diagnosed clinically, based on symptoms and exposures, whereas those clinically diagnosed cases were suspected cases with abnormal pulmonary imaging consistent with coronavirus pneumonia.

A sobering set of analyses in the baseline characteristics of the cases was the age specific case fatality rates (CFR). The overall CFR among the 72 000+ cases analyzed was 2.3 %. In the 0-9 years the CFR was 0 as no deaths were reported out of 416 cases; in the 10-19 years, 20-29 years and 30-39 years age groups the CFR was 0.2%. In the 40-49 years, the CFR was 0.4%, the 50-59 years 1.3 %, 60-69 years 3.6 %, 70-79% 8.0% and the 80 years or older 14.8%.

CFRs by type of co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease 10.5%, diabetes 7.3%, chronic respiratory disease 6.3%, hypertension 6.0%, cancer 5.6%, and none 2.6%

An interesting look at the CFRs by time period: Before 31 Dec 2019 14.4%; 1-10 Jan 2020 15.6%; 11-20 Jan 2020 5.7%; 21-31 Jan 2020 1.9%; and after 1 Feb 2020 0.8%. Possibly attributable to the known phenomenon of early recognition of more serious cases, followed by introduction of testing (12 Jan 2020), combined with health services overwhelmed by the volume of cases and the volume of ICU care beds needed.

There is an excellent series on the geo-temporal progression of the outbreak in China available at Figure 2 at the source URL. Figure 3 shows epidemiological curves of the number of cases by date of onset of confirmed cases, compared with suspected cases, clinically diagnosed cases, and asymptomatic cases. Figures 3A and 3B are epidemiological curves by date of onset of confirmed cases compared with number of cases diagnosed each day for confirmed cases.

Figure 4A shows the epidemiological curve for cases reported outside of Hubei, and figure 4B shows the epidemiological curve for cases among healthcare personnel (a total of 3019 if one includes suspected and clinically confirmed cases.)

The author's conclusion is noting the highly infectious nature of this coronavirus with spread from one city to countrywide in approximately 30 days, even with the shutdown and isolation of whole cities, cancellation of New Year celebrations, prohibition of school and work attendance, and rapid construction of hospitals. They note the good news, that the disease is mild for 81% of patients with a low overall CFR of 2.3%

The authors note that there seem to be 2 different transmission patterns of this outbreak. The 1st they describe as a continuous common source pattern of spread in December 2019 and then the 2nd pattern from early January 2020 through 11 Feb 2020 (and presumably onward in time) a propagated source pattern. Consistent with the ongoing theory of possible multiple common source exposures in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market I Wuhan City, where the virus was transmitted from animal (as yet unknown) to humans, followed by the viruses high mutation and recombination rates to facilitate rapid human-to-human transmission.

The authors raise the following questions still needing addressing: identification of the animal reservoir, determination of infectiousness period, identification of transmission routes, and effective treatment and prevention methods, including further test development, drug development, and vaccine development.

While they note a leveling off of transmission, they caution there may be another increase in transmission as people return to work and school as the isolation measures are lifted. - Mod.MPP]

An additional 99 people have tested positive for coronavirus on a cruise ship off the Japan coast, Japanese media said [Mon 17 Feb 2020], citing new figures from the health ministry. That would take the total number of positive cases on the Diamond Princess to 454. It was also not clear whether the figures included 14 US citizens who tested positive for the virus but were allowed to board evacuation flights home.

The Diamond Princess vessel moored in Yokohama near Tokyo has become the 2nd-largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside the epicentre in China. Passengers have been largely confined to quarters since [5 Feb 2020] with only brief and occasional breaks to take air on deck -- with face masks. The quarantine period is over on [Wed 19 Feb 2020] but many countries have decided to repatriate their citizens after an alarming climb in cases on board. The US was the 1st country to evacuate its citizens from the ship but Australia, Canada, Italy, and Hong Kong have indicated they will follow suit.

On land, cases in Japan have risen to 65, with authorities warning that the outbreak is entering a "new phase" and advising people to avoid large gatherings. A public celebration of the new emperor's birthday on [Sun 23 Feb 2020] has been scrapped and organisers of the Tokyo Marathon scheduled on [1 Mar 2020] are reportedly considering cancelling the amateur part of the race.

[The number of positive laboratory confirmations among the Diamond Princess quarantined (passengers and crew) continues to grow. One suspects there are a multitude of reasons behind this -- possible fomite contamination of surfaces, the air duct systems aboard the boat, crew living in dormitory-like conditions with multiple people to a room, individuals not following correct use of PPE (personal protective equipment) to name a few.

It is noteworthy that 14 of the 338 evacuees transferred back to the USA were found to be infected with the coronavirus (the SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the disease COVID-19) (figures on evacuees came from a NY Times/Reuters article https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/02/17/world/asia/17reuters-china-health-japan-cruiseship.html. - Mod.MPP]

Japan enters "new phase" of coronavirus outbreak
------------------------------------------------
The number of coronavirus cases in Japan has now reached over 500, including 454 from a cruise ship docked near Tokyo. The health ministry is scrambling to come up with measures to limit the outbreak but infections continue to emerge in prefectures around the country. Officials are struggling to identify infection routes in at least four of the cases.

Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said on [Sat 15 Feb 2020] that Japan has entered a "new phase" of the outbreak.

A male doctor in his 50s in Wakayama Prefecture tested positive for the coronavirus on [Thu 13 Feb 2020]. Since then, 8 more people in the prefecture, including patients at the doctor's hospital, have been infected. Troublingly, the Health Ministry says it has been unable to figure out where these transmissions originated. The ministry says it has also been unable to identify infection routes for a man in his 60s in Aichi Prefecture, a man in his 20s in Chiba Prefecture, and a man in the northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido. Until recently, officials were able to easily identify the transmission routes, as the majority of the infected had been among those the government flew back from Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, or the passengers of the quarantined cruise ship docked near Tokyo.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened a meeting of epidemiologists at his office on [Sun 16 Feb 2020]. He said the situation in the country is changing "minute by minute" and emphasized the need to tackle the outbreak from an epidemiological standpoint.

Takaji Wakita, head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said Japan was in the initial stages of the outbreak and could see cases continue to spread. The epidemiologists agreed that people should go to the doctor if they develop flu-like symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and difficulty breathing. The panel added that it was crucial to do so promptly, so they could receive treatment before their conditions became serious. The panel also agreed to set up guidelines to encourage and help vulnerable people, such as the elderly and those suffering from chronic illnesses, seek medical consultation even earlier.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he is committing all available resources to provide accurate and prompt testing and counseling.

The private sector has started putting its own measures in place. Telecom giant NTT says it is urging employees to work from home or adopt staggered hours. The company says it is also calling on staff to avoid in-person meetings and to instead use videoconferencing. Yahoo Japan is also urging employees to adopt staggered hours. One company in the tourist hub of Kyoto is taking no chances. Software-maker connectFree has asked its employees to work entirely from home, conducting client meetings online. For staff members who must be in the office, the company has made facemasks and antiseptic handwash mandatory.

[6] WHO situation report 28 (as of 17 Feb 2020*)
Date: Mon 17 Feb 2020
Source: World Health Organization [edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200217-sitrep-28-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=a19cf2ad_2


*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- From today [17 Feb 2020], WHO will be reporting all confirmed cases, including both laboratory-confirmed as previously reported, and those reported as clinically diagnosed (currently only applicable to Hubei province, China). From [13 Feb through 16 Feb 2020], we reported only laboratory confirmed cases for Hubei province as mentioned in the situation report published on [13 Feb 2020]. The change in reporting is now shown in the figures. This accounts for the apparent large increase in cases compared to prior situation reports.

- Based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19, WHO has developed guidance documents for managing public health events at Points of Entry and mass gatherings. These are posted on WHO COVID-19 Points of Entry and Mass Gatherings website (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings). See Technical focus for more details.

- WHO Eastern Mediterranean office has updated information on COVID-19 cases. For more information please see http://www.emro.who.int/media/news/update-on-covid-19-in-the-eastern-mediterranean-region.html

Technical focus: points of entry (PoE) and mass gatherings
----------------------------------------------------------
A point of entry (PoE) encompasses ports, airports, ground crossings, and means of passage for international entry or exit of travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and postal parcels as well as agencies and areas providing services to them on entry or exit (International Health Regulations 2005).

Based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19, WHO has developed guidance documents for managing public health events at PoE and mass gatherings. These are posted on WHO COVID-19 Points of Entry and Mass Gatherings website (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings).

The materials currently available are:
- Key planning recommendations for mass gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this document will be to outline key planning considerations for organizers of mass gatherings in the context of COVID-19 outbreak, to be read in conjunction with WHO's Public Health for Mass Gatherings: Key Considerations.

- Management of ill travellers at points of entry in the context of COVID-19 outbreak. This document provides advice on the detection and the management of ill travellers at international ports, airports, and ground crossings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak. It includes the following measures and should be implemented based on priorities and capacities of each country:
* detection of ill travellers;
* interview of ill travellers for COVID-19;
* reporting of alerts of ill travellers with suspected COVID-19 infection;
* isolation, initial case management and referral of ill travellers with suspected COVID-19 infection.

- Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships: this is a generic guidance addressing all public health risks and related maritime rules and regulations to assist States Parties in contingency planning and implementation of health measures onboard ships and at ports.

- Handbook for the management of public health events in air transport: this handbook was developed in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization. It is intended to help competent authorities at airports to implement a risk-based approach to public health events in a consistent manner and assist in determining interventions that are commensurate to the risks.
- An online course for public health preparedness for mass gathering events to support host nations in delivering a safe event.

The material that is in production includes operational considerations for managing COVID-19 cases/outbreak on board cruise ships. This material has been prepared based on the evidence currently available about COVID-19 transmission, by providing operational considerations for public health measures to manage cases, contacts, and environment. It is recommended to be used in conjunction with the Handbook for the management of public health events on board ships.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China remains at 14 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, and Egypt). There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan related to a quarantine officer. - Mod.MPP

Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
