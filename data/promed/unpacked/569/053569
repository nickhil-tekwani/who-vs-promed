Mumps virus outbreak in Baltimore's Loyola University
-----------------------------------------------------
Loyola campus officials have put out a campus community alert to watch out for symptoms of the rare virus. The students who came down with mumps live on and off the North Baltimore campus. Mumps virus used to be very common in the United States among infants, children, and young adults, but became rare after a widespread vaccination campaign for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR). The MMR vaccine is one of the recommended childhood immunizations, given first when a child is 12 to 15 months old and followed up with a 2nd shot, usually before the child enters school by age 6. The MMR vaccine is reputed to be 90 per cent effective, and like many schools, Loyola University requires the MMR vaccination for all enrolled students.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mumps symptoms start with several days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, which are followed by swelling of the salivary glands and testicular or ovarian inflammation within 2 to 4 weeks of infection. Half of the people who get mumps, however, show mild or no symptoms.

Mumps virus is contagious, and spreads through the saliva or mucus of an infected person. Anyone who is not already immune to the mumps virus from vaccination or previous infection can be afflicted by it. As one might imagine with a disease that spreads through bodily fluids, mumps outbreaks are most common in places that bring together many young people living in the same place, like summer camps and universities.

According to the Baltimore Sun, Loyola University officials notified the campus community of the 1st cases before spring break started on 4 Mar 2013, and sent a warning letter this week [week of 11 Mar 2013] about the growing number of cases. In addition to the 12 confirmed cases of the mumps virus, several more suspected cases have been reported, said Loyola University spokeswoman Courtney Jolley.

[Outbreaks of mumps occur occasionally in universities and similar educational institutions where young adults from diverse backgrounds congregate. Although the current mumps virus vaccine strains included in the triple MMR vaccine induce sufficient immunity to protect virtually all young children from mumps virus infection, the level of immunity maintained in older children and young adults may be less than adequate to provide protection under all circumstances. This reduced extent of protection does not appear to be a consequence of antigenic diversity among circulating mumps viruses, although genetically distinct strains of mumps virus appear to circulate globally. - Mod.CP
