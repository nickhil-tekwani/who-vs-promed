Already struggling to recover from one of the country's worst droughts
on record, Syria's agricultural sector has been dealt another blow,
with up to one-third of its wheat crop damaged by a virulent disease.

Yellow rust infections have been "significant" in Syria's breadbasket
eastern region, according to farmers and officials. With harvests now
being collected, they warned that production of soft wheat could be
cut by half compared with last year [2009]. Hard wheat that makes up
approximately 40 percent of the total wheat crop, has not been affected.

Farmers in Raqqa confirmed that 50 percent of their soft wheat has
been decimated. Both the larger, mechanised, well irrigated farms and
smaller plots rented from the government have been hit by the
outbreak. The government is evaluating the problem, but details on the
extent of the disease have not been released.

According to agricultural scientists, the "Cham 8" variety of soft
wheat, used in Syria because of its high yield and tolerance to other
diseases, has proven weak against yellow rust.

The United Nations is distributing food packages, but funding received
is only sufficient for two thirds of the 300 000 people targeted.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale
(wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind
dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus
survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge" between
seasons. Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties,
fungicide applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and are
also suspected to have emerged in China. Monitoring programmes are
important to recognise these emerging new strains. Depending on the
susceptibility of preferred cereal varieties grown in different
countries, it can be expected that new rust strains will differ in
national or regional significance.

The International Centre for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas
(ICARDA) reports that in Syria up to 80 percent of fields are affected
by a new strain of stripe rust (ProMED-mail post 20100531.1803). It is
one of the countries where key cereal production regions are under
threat. Breeding programmes for stripe rust resistant wheat varieties
are in progress at ICARDA and elsewhere. Some new resistant varieties
are already available, but the process of releasing these to farmers
has been slow in some areas.

Soft wheats (_Triticum aestivum_, used mostly for bread) and hard (or
durum) wheats (_T. turgidum_, used for example for pasta) are
different species and therefore different levels of susceptibility to
pathogen strains can be expected.
