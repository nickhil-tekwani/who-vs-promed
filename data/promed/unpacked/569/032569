A neonatal intensive care unit in a hospital in the southern Brazil state of Rio Grande do Sul has been temporarily closed due to an outbreak of enterovirus, which has sickened 8 newborns, according to a Globo 1 report (computer translated).

The situation reported at the Windmills Hospital in Porto Alegre is as follows: 4 confirmed, 3 suspected cases and at least 1 death has been reported. The report does not specify which enterovirus strain is implicated in the outbreak.

Hospital officials do say that they have suspended admissions and they are transferring high-risk pregnancies and births in obstetric emergency services to other hospitals, UOL Noticias reports (computer translated).

The hospital was apparently fined for not notifying health authorities of the outbreak. The institution ensures that [they] are doing everything possible to avoid contamination. Other services usually follow the hospital [?]. Newborns who were already hospitalized remain in place, with the necessary security measures.

Rio Grande do Sul (Great Southern River) is a state located in the southernmost part of Brazil.

[The news report above does not specify which enterovirus serotype(s) is implicated in this outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit (ICU), nor does it give detailed clinical or epidemiologic characteristics of the outbreak. Serotyping and genotyping isolates that have the same serotype may help establish whether this is a common source outbreak. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

Enteroviruses are RNA viruses that include the polioviruses types 1, 2, and 3, coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, and other enteroviruses. Serologic studies have distinguished over 71 enterovirus serotypes on the basis of antibody neutralization tests. Enteroviruses are associated with diverse clinical syndromes that include minor febrile illnesses, herpangina, hand, foot and mouth disease, Bornholm disease or epidemic pleurodynia, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, and severe, potentially fatal conditions, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, and neonatal enteroviral sepsis. Enteroviruses are often found in the respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) and stool of an infected person and are usually spread through via respiratory droplets or the fecal-oral route.

Enteroviral outbreaks in neonatal ICUs have been reported in the past (http://www.uptodate.com/contents/nosocomial-viral-infections-in-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit). Transmission in a neonatal ICU may initially be from an infected mother to child during the delivery or post-partum period, and subsequent spread from infant to infant because of inadequate infection control. Some enteroviral serotypes are capable of producing in the newborn a severe, life-threatening and fulminant sepsis-like illness with myocarditis, pneumonia, hepatitis, and/or coagulopathy or meningitis/encephalitis; significant sequelae may occur in survivors (e.g., poor neuro-developmental outcome, and heart or liver failure) (1-4).
