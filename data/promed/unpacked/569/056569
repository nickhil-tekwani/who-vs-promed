RABIES, HUMAN - CHINA (GUANGDONG) (02): CORRECTION

A Correction
------------
Several ProMED-mail subscribers have pointed out an error in the text of
the Agence France Presse report contained in the post entitled: "Rabies,
human - China (Guangdong) 20030721.1783", which was reproduced without
comment or correction.
The offending statement read: "Rabies is a serious, fatal disease that can
be transmitted by dogs, cats, livestock, and certain wild animals and
birds." In fact, although pre-human diploid cell vaccines were produced in
embryonated duck eggs or primary chicken and quail embryo cells, birds have
never been shown to be susceptible to rabies virus infection, nor have
raptors or avian scavenger species been implicated in the transmission of
rabies. The report should have been amended to read "terrestrial animals
and bats".
My thanks to all who alerted us to this inaccuracy. - Mod.CP
