An Emirates Airline flight was held in quarantine for a period at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after a large number of passengers were reported feeling ill during the flight.

The airline said in a statement that about 10 passengers on the flight from Dubai to New York had become ill on board. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] said the estimated number was about 100. Passengers and some crew complained of illness including cough, according to the CDC; some had developed a fever.

"CDC public health officers are working with port authority, EMS, and CBP officials to evaluate passengers including taking temperatures and making arrangements for transport to local hospitals," the CDC said. "Passengers who are not ill will be allowed to continue with their travel plans, and if necessary will be followed up with by health officials."

A spokesman for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said 19 passengers had taken ill -- 10 were sent to a hospital and another 9 refused medical attention. There were approximately 521 passengers on the flight.

A number of the passengers on the flight were returning from the Hajj, the annual mass pilgrimage to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia, a source told STAT. It was unclear if the people who were ill were the same passengers who had attended.

Saudi Arabia has reported cases of MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome, which passes to people from camels. But the fact that so many people became ill during the flight would make MERS seem an unlikely cause.

A total of 19 people have been taken ill after an Emirates airline plane landed in New York, officials say. The plane was quarantined at JFK airport as those on board were checked by health officials. As many as 10 were taken to hospital but others refused treatment.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that initially about 100 people including some crew had complained of illness. Flight 203 from Dubai landed at 09:10 (13.10 GMT) with 521 passengers.

Emergency vehicles were seen on the runway as it landed. Soon afterwards, Emirates airline tweeted that the sick passengers were being attended to and those who were unaffected would be allowed to leave the plane.

The CDC said in a statement that is was "aware of an Emirates flight from Dubai that arrived this morning at JFK".

"Approximately 100 passengers, including some crew on the flight, complained of illness including cough and some with fever.

"CDC public health officers are working with... officials to evaluate passengers including taking temperatures and making arrangements for transport to local hospitals those that need care."

Later Eric Phillips, spokesman for New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, confirmed that all the passengers were off the plane and the sick people had been taken to hospital.

He said that some of the passengers had originally come from the Saudi Arabian city of Mecca, which was currently experiencing a flu outbreak, and that the passengers' symptoms were "pointing to the flu".

Health and safety officials are investigating an illness that struck people on an Emirates Airline flight from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday morning.

A total of 7 crew members and 3 passengers were taken to the hospital, Emirates Airline said. It added that [Wed 5 Sep 2018] return flight from New York to Dubai would leave 3 hours late.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said around 100 people on the overnight Flight 203 had complained of illness. For some, the symptoms were limited to a cough; others had a fever.

An Emirates A380 in quarantine at JFK Airport right now awaiting CDC officials after about 100 passengers became ill with fevers over 100 degrees and coughing. Flight 203 had just arrived from Dubai.

Ten people were taken off the plane for treatment at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, said Eric Phillips, press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. He said 9 others were found to be sick but refused medical attention.

The aircraft was carrying around 521 passengers. Health officials allowed people to disembark only after checking each one for symptoms, Phillips stated, adding, "The plane's been quarantined and the CDC is on the scene."

As for what the sickness might be, Phillips referred to a "flu outbreak" in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and said that might be a possibility, stating, "It appears some of the ill passengers came from Mecca before getting on in Dubai."

[One] passenger called it the "worst flight ever," saying on Twitter that the plane "was basically a flying infirmary. Many of these people should never have been allowed to board."

By around noon, 432 passengers had been cleared and allowed to go to the customs area, according to Phillips. A few others who showed symptoms were held for treatment and possible transport to the hospital.

NPR's Rob Stein reports that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with local authorities. The Airbus A380 jet was isolated on the tarmac at JFK, as officials took stock of the situation. Images from the scene showed a row of ambulances alongside the aircraft.

[Another] passenger said via Twitter that CDC staff came onto the plane and that everyone aboard was asked to fill out a form providing their contact information for the next 3 weeks.

[Mention a plane load of individuals with febrile respiratory symptoms coming from the Middle East and immediate panic of "could this be MERS-CoV?" Equally or more serious than this is an outbreak of influenza. According to the media coverage, there is an ongoing outbreak of influenza in Mecca (Makkah) (Saudi Arabia, where Hajji's congregate) now, concurrent with the Hajj, and a rapid onset of respiratory symptoms is more likely to be influenza than it is MERS-CoV. We still do not have information as to the origins of the ill passengers to know if they were beginning their trips in Mecca and were returning Hajji's or if they began their travels elsewhere. Presumably the crew members began their working journeys in Dubai, but may have commuted in from elsewhere in or outside of the region (and there is mention of ill crew members).

Returning to the possibility that this is related to the Hajj, a mass gathering of more than 2 million individuals from all over the world, making a religious pilgrimage to Mecca, it is interesting to review the Saudi Hajj/Umrah health requirements. While some vaccines are mandatory (meningitis vaccine, polio if coming from a country with ongoing poliovirus transmission, and yellow fever if coming from a known yellow fever endemic area, in contrast, influenza vaccine is recommended but not obligatory.

"Seasonal Influenza:
"The Saudi Ministry of Health recommends that international pilgrims be vaccinated against seasonal influenza before arrival into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, particularly those at increased risk of severe influenza diseases, including pregnant women, children under 5 years, the elderly, and individuals with underlying health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, and chronic heart or lung diseases. In Saudi Arabia, seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for internal pilgrims, particularly those at risk described above, and all health-care workers in the Hajj premises." https://www.saudiembassy.net/hajj-and-umrah-health-requirements

Given concerns re: possible MERS-CoV transmission to pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia, many countries have increased surveillance of respiratory illnesses in returning pilgrims (notably post Hajj), and in the 6 years since identification of the MERS-CoV, there have been no cases among returning Hajji's and just a handful of cases among individuals returning from having performed the Umrah pilgrimage. Movement and exposures of visiting Hajj pilgrims are controlled - camels are not permitted in the area where Hajjis are congregated, healthcare workers and others identified as contacts of confirmed MERS-CoV cases are not permitted to go to the Hajj area Studies addressing the etiologies of respiratory illnesses in returning Hajji's have identified influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and rhinovirus (see Respiratory infections - UK: Hajj returnees 20151011.3706464 and Respiratory virus infections - Saudi Arabia: Hajj pilgrims 2012 20130730.1854631). Note that the incubation period for influenza ranges from 1-4 days so transmission during travel is a plausible event.

The actual number of individual identified as ill enough to require medical treatment at a hospital seems to be between 19 and 27 (taking into account the additional 8 identified and mentioned by the New York City's mayor's spokesperson in a tweet). Presumably these individuals had a fever above 100 F (37.8 C) and cough. The extension of the count to approaching 100 individuals may include those with a cough, possibly in the early stages of illness (influenza frequently begins with a dry cough), and others possibly coughing in response to hearing others coughing around them (think theater or lectures when coughing begins...)

As the rapid respiratory virus screening tests should be available in a reasonable amount of time, we will post information as it becomes available, but should any knowledgeable sources have additional information that can be shared with us, ProMED would be very grateful.
