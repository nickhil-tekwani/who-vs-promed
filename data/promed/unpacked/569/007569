Comments re: Avian influenza (14): H5N1 WHO 20120210.1038410
---------------------------------------------------------
This 09 Feb 2012 article by Helen Branswell states that the H5N1 Avian influenza virus used by the Dutch laboratory at Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam originated from Indonesia and that scientists from the Indonesian laboratory that provided the virus isolate are invited to WHO conference on 16 Feb 2012. This information provides clarifying context to comments made by Dr. Ron Fouchier, who led the Rotterdam lab that created [i.e. isolated] a mutant H5N1 avian influenza virus that became respiratory-transmissible while still maintaining its ability to kill some of the ferrets used in the experiments.

For example, in the [20 Jan 2012] Science Insider article by Martin Enserink based on an interview with Dr. Fouchier, and translated from Dutch, he states: "Also, as researchers, we work very closely with people in Indonesia. It would be very unwise not to share our results with our close collaborators."

In response to the question: "You also want to repeat the experiments with more H5N1 strains?" Dr. Fouchier replied: "Yes. We did this with one genetic lineage of the H5N1 virus. The question is whether all lineages can become aerosol-transmissible. If they can't, if it's just this lineage, perhaps you can focus on the region where it came from and try to stop H5N1 outbreaks there to prevent a pandemic. If it can happen everywhere, you've got to work everywhere." The genetic lineage, or clade, of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that has circulated in Indonesia is one found predominately only in Indonesia and is a distinct clade from those found in other parts of Asia or Africa. Thus, it is rational to have one or more scientists from Indonesia participating in the WHO meeting next week, even if the sharing of the H5N1 virus isolate from Indonesia with the Rotterdam lab occurred before the May 2011 WHO's Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework went into effect.

The rationale for the leading role of Indonesia from 2007-2011 in what would, after much controversy and debate, become the PIP Framework document is detailed in the Ann Acad Med Singapore 2008; 37: 482-88 paper co-authored by the current and immediate past Minister of Health entitled: "Towards Mutual Trust, Transparency and Equity in Virus Sharing Mechanism: The Avian Influenza Case of Indonesia".

[The WHO meeting, to be held on 16 and 17 Feb 2012 at the WHO's headquarters, will focus on the most basic problems that have arisen as a result of the Avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus controversy. In essence: should the 2 papers at the heart of the dispute be published? In full or in abbreviated form? If they must be abbreviated, which sections must be held back?

Further comment on this topic will be withheld until the outcome of the meeting and the identities of the participants become available. - Mod.CP]]
