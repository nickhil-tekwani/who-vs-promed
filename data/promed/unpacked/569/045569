Two more people have contracted hepatitis C after receiving intravenous
anesthesia from a doctor in New York who is under investigation.
[Previously, laboratory tests suggested that 3 of about 4500 potentially
exposed patients were infected while getting intravenous anesthesia drugs
during outpatient medical procedures. - Mod.CP]. [A 64 year old doctor] is
accused of spreading the disease by failing to follow proper infection
control protocols, The New York Post reported [on Sun 24 Jun 2007].
A 45 year old woman with a prominent corporate post filed a lawsuit last
week [18-24 Jun 2007] against the doctor and 3 other doctors at a Manhattan
practice, where she underwent a colonoscopy in 2004. She filed her suit as
"Jane Doe" due to what she called the "stigma, discrimination, and
embarrassment" of a hepatitis C infection, which typically affects drug
addicts and the sexually promiscuous.
Another woman has notified the city Health Department after contracting
hepatitis C after an outpatient procedure. That notification brings the
number of possible victims to at least 5, the Post said.

[Worldwide, about 170 million people are infected with hepatitis C virus
and there are about 40 thousand new cases of hepatitis C in the United
States per year. Nonetheless, transmission of hepatitis C in a medical
setting is rare and avoidable when standard infection control procedures
are followed. The basis for relating these rare instances of hepatitis C
infection to anaesthetic procedures in medical practice is unclear and the
evidence yet to be revealed. At this stage, legal proceedings would seem to
be somewhat opportunistic.
The consequences of hepatitis C virus infection, apart from the perceived
stigma, may be severe since chronic infections (developing in perhaps 50
per cent of cases) that may result in liver damage and death. Fortunately,
chronic hepatitis is now treatable with pegylated interferon and/or the
antiviral ribavirin, although the outcome is, to some extent, dependent on
the genotype of the infecting virus. - Mod.CP]
