UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS - POLAND: SEPSIS SUSPECTED, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I received a report from a colleague in Poland regarding an
unidentified "sepsis" being reported in the news in Warsaw and other
cities. No other symptomology was available, but it reportedly
originated among recruits at military bases 2-3 weeks ago and is now
beginning to be seen in the civilian population. Deaths have
evidently been reported, including a 3-year-old child.
Does anyone have any clarifying information on this?

[We have not been able to obtain additional information on the
above-reported event in Poland. In the absence of more information
on the symptoms it is very difficult to even attempt speculation on
possible etiology (it is tempting to try to speculate something like
meningococcal septicemia which has been observed in military
recruits, and of course might be part of a larger outbreak ongoing in
the community.... but hazardous in the absence of additional information).
ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information from
knowledgeable sources on the above-mentioned outbreak of a
"sepsis-like" illness in Poland. - Mod.MPP]
