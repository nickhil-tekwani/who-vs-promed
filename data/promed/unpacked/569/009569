Outbreak of polio prompts mass vaccination campaign in West Africa
------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the governments of Niger, Burkina
Faso, and Mali are launching a cross-border polio vaccination campaign
today [13 Jun 2008] following an April 2008 report of a polio case at
Tillabery in south west Niger, 100 km [62 miles] from the borders of Mali
and Burkina Faso. The campaign will target the Gao region in Mali, north
eastern Burkina Faso, and southern Niger, including Maradi, Tahoua and the
capital, Niamey.

"Hundreds of thousands of children will be vaccinated, the majority of them
in Niger, to avoid the virus spreading into neighbouring countries,"
Mathieu Kamwa, coordinator of the WHO West Africa office told IRIN. "We
will pay particular attention to populations that frequently move across
the borders of these three countries," said Kamwa.

The campaign aims to create a polio barrier to prevent the spread of the
virus in polio-free areas of the 3 countries. WHO officials fear the
re-emergence of polio in Tillabery, which has been free of the virus for 3
years, because of its proximity to the borders Burkina Faso and Mali.

Burkina Faso and Mali have had no reported polio cases since 2004 and both
are on their way to receiving certification as polio-free countries in
October 2008. Niger meanwhile reported 9 cases in 2008.

Tillabery is 180km [112 miles] from Nigeria, where 21 percent of the
world's polio cases were reported in 2007. That made it one of 4 countries
in the world alongside India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where polio is
still endemic.

According to WHO's Kamwa, 247 cases of polio have been reported in Nigeria
since January 2008.

Polio mainly affects children under 5 years old, with one in 200 infections
leading to irreversible paralysis, according to WHO.

Endemic countries
-----------------
India
- In 2008, 222 cases have been reported (4 type 1 and 218 type 3).
- Technical support to Bihar has been scaled-up in order to meet the
primary objective of stopping type 1 poliovirus transmission in this key
reservoir. The increased support is focused primarily on the high risk
blocks of Bihar, particularly access-compromised areas such as the Kosi
River basin. Initial reports from the [27 Apr 2008] SIAs [supplemental
immunization activities] indicate strong technical and supervisory presence
and high coverage rates in all visited areas.
- The type 3 outbreak in Bihar is waning (148 cases reported in Quarter 1
2008, from 416 in Quarter 4 2007). The majority of type 3 cases in Bihar in
recent weeks are in blocks with only one round of SIAs using type 3
monovalent oral polio vaccine (mOPV3). The most recent mOPV3 round was at
the end of March [2008].
- The April [2008] SIAs used a mix of type 1 monovalent and trivalent oral
polio vaccine (mOPV1 and tOPV), to maintain the pressure on type 1
transmission. Uttar Pradesh has passed a historic 5 months without any type
1 polio detected in the state; Bihar has reported 1 case of type 1 this
year [2008] (January). However, mop-up vaccination response to type 1 in
Delhi, Orissa and West Bengal has been limited, leaving these areas at risk
of further type 1 transmission.
- The Minister of Health held a review meeting of the polio eradication
programme on [3 Apr 2008], concluding that progress in stopping type 1 was
encouraging and that the type 3 outbreak had been controlled.

Nigeria
- In 2008, 167 cases have been reported (150 type 1 and 17 type 3).
- The upsurge in type 1 cases in Nigeria to date this year is close to that
of the entire year in 2007 (116), although transmission is geographically
more limited. Over a 5th of the type 1 cases in 2008 are in Kano state (25
cases). Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) were held in 10 northern high risk
states on 5-8 Apr 2008, using mOPV1, followed by [19-22 Apr 2008] in
high-risk districts of other states. This staggering of activities is to
ensure that the highest-risk areas benefit from full concentration of human
resources.
- Improvements in operational quality and vaccination coverage are urgently
necessary during the IPDs planned before Ramadan.
- While Nigeria accounts for 84 per cent of all type 1 polio cases in the
world, transmission of type 3 is at low levels, with 8 reported this year.
SIAs continue to intersperse mOPV1 and mOPV3 with tOPV [trivalent] to curb
type 1 transmission in the north and stop the small type 3 outbreak around
Oyo state.

Pakistan and Afghanistan
- In 2008, 7 cases have been reported in Pakistan (all type 1 in Sindh
province); and 6 cases have been reported in Afghanistan (4 type 1 and 2
type 3, all in the southern region).
- In Afghanistan, national immunization days (NIDs) were held on [13-15 Apr
2008], using a mix of mOPV3 and tOPV. The new strategy of Short Interval
Additional Dose (SIAD) -足 introduced in January to deliver an extra dose to
communities living in known transmission zones who are difficult to reach
due to security conditions -足 was repeated on [20-22 Apr 2008]. The most
severely security-challenged areas of the southern region have a target
population of 750 000 children under the age of 5 years, out of a national
target population of 7.6 million.
- In Pakistan, all cases this year have been from Sindh province, from
northern through central Sindh to Karachi in the south. Strategies to
further improve operations in this province were discussed at the Regional
Technical Advisory Group meeting in Cairo ([12-13 Apr 2008]). These include
the systematic concentration of technical support in highest risk districts
and greater reliance on independent monitoring and objective indicators
such as finger-marking to guide SIA assessment.
- NIDs were held in transmission zones in Pakistan on [8-10 Apr 2008],
using a mix of mOPV3 and tOPV.

Reinfected countries
--------------------
Angola
- In 2008, 5 cases have been reported, 1 type 1 and 4 type 3. This is the
1st importation of type 3 poliovirus into Angola. Genetic sequencing
indicates that the 1st type 3 case detected (with onset of paralysis on [19
Mar 2008) is related to virus from Uttar Pradesh, India.
- All cases have been in the Luanda area, where the 2nd mop-up of the year
was carried out on [18-20 Apr 2008] with mOPV1; a mix of mOPV1 and mOPV3
will be used during NIDs scheduled for [16-18 May 2008] due to the presence
of type 3 poliovirus.

Central African Republic (CAR)
- CAR has reported its first case 足- a type 1 -足 since November 2004.
Genetic sequencing is awaited to determine the origin of the virus.
- Detection of polio after a gap of over 3 years emphasizes the continued
importance of sensitive surveillance, especially in the vicinity of endemic
countries. NIDs were held on [4 Apr 2008].

Chad
- With 2 cases reported this year, both type 3, Chad remains a high risk
country for polio transmission due to weak operations during its 2 SIAs
this year, conducted in the midst of insecurity. Following a meeting
between government and partners in early April [2008], SIAs have been
scheduled in staggered phases across the country due to security
constraints: the first of these took place in the last week of April
[2008]; the next are due to take place end-May [2008]and end-June [2008].
It is critical to boost population immunity before the onset of the rains
in June.

Democratic Republic of Congo
- Two cases have been reported this year, both type 1. The most recent is
from the previously uninfected province of North Kivu; genetic sequencing
is awaited to determine whether this represents a new importation.
- Following a mop-up targeting 400 000 children on [10-12 Apr 2008], using
mOPV1, large-scale SIAs are planned for [8-10 May 2008] and again in June
[2008] (also with mOPV1).

Nepal and Niger
- Both countries continue to be exposed to repeated importations, due to
their proximity to endemic areas of India and northern Nigeria
respectively. Both also continue outbreak response activities; in Nepal, 4
SIAs have been held between December 2007 and April 2008, and no cases have
been reported since [16 Feb 2008]. Niger's most recent campaigns were on [5
Apr 2008], using mOPV1 along its border with Nigeria.

Horn of Africa
- Two polio cases were reported in the Ethiopia/south Sudan cross-border
area, the 1st polio reported this year to the east of Chad.
- Confirmation of these cases, which are genetically related to previously
circulating virus, underscores the need to sustain campaigns in this
difficult-to-access area, and to urgently fill subnational surveillance
gaps across central Africa. Although current population immunity levels
across the Horn of Africa are higher than in 2004-2005, there is a risk of
further polio spread, facilitated by frequent population movements.
- A combined cross-border outbreak response is currently being planned. Two
large-scale SIAs covering the whole of southern Sudan (targeting 2.5
million children) and 52 districts of south western Ethiopia bordering
southern Sudan (targeting 400 000 children) will be held in early May
[2008] and again in early June [2008], using mOPV1. Longer-term plans, also
to strengthen sub-national surveillance gaps across several countries in
central Africa, are being formulated.

[At present, there are 4 countries that are still endemic for wild
poliovirus (WPV) -- India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria. As can be
seen from the above updates, there have been continued WPV cases identified
in 2008, in previously polio-free areas in both Asia (Nepal 3 cases) and
Africa (Benin 1, Chad 4, Niger 9, Central African Republic 1, Ethiopia 1,
Dem Rep of the Congo 2, and Sudan 1). Of concern is that while there have
been continued importations into some of these countries, in the Horn of
Africa (Ethiopia/Sudan) there is evidence that there was probable
undetected circulation of the WPV previously identified in 2007 (see notes
for Horn of Africa in part [3] above).

It is also noteworthy that WPV 3 has been occurring in a number of the
countries in 2008 -- India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Angola (imported from
India), Nigeria, Chad, and Nepal (see table at the polio eradication
website <http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>.)
In response to this, mOPV3 has been used in immunization campaigns.

For maps of WPV infected countries see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casemap.shtml>. For more
detailed maps with information on districts and dates of most recent WPV1
and WPV3 isolates, see
