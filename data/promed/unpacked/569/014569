[In the past 2 days since the last update (12 Feb 2019), there have been 2 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia. Both were males in Wadi Aldawasir, where there has been ongoing transmission both in the community as well as in one or more healthcare facilities. Both newly confirmed cases were classified as secondary healthcare-acquired cases, one of which was reported as a fatality at the time of initial confirmation report. There was a 2nd fatality reported in a previously confirmed case, also in a secondary healthcare-acquired case with an initial confirmation report on 8 Feb 2019.

Noteworthy is the number of previously confirmed cases (5) that had been listed as on home isolation and were changed to hospitalized, suggesting the asymptomatic or mild infection at the time of confirmation developed into more serious disease requiring hospitalization. In my memory over the years reporting on MERS-CoV cases, this is the 1st time we are seeing in real time reported mild or asymptomatic cases progressing to more serious disease.

Also noteworthy is the number of cases whose initial classification by transmission type was changed after further investigation (6 cases): 3 cases reclassified as secondary healthcare-acquired infections and 3 reclassified as primary community-acquired infections.

The total of laboratory-confirmed infections reported since 1 Jan 2019 is now 61, with 38 cases reported from Wadi Aldawasir since 29 Jan 2019.

[The above media report mentions a 6th case confirmed in Oman in the past 2 weeks. The previous 5 cases were all female residents of a household that was associated with a camel farm, although none of the infected individuals gave a history of direct contact with camels. The current ministry report (https://www.moh.gov.om/en/-/---973) does not mention if this newly reported case is associated with the previous cluster. No further epidemiologic information was available. If any of our subscribers have more information to share, it would be greatly appreciated.
