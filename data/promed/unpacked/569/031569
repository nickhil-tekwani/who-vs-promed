The State Health Department is investigating 4 cases of _Legionella_ infection, a [type of pneumonia], all treated at Queen's Medical Center.

It [_Legionella_] went airborne from [contaminated] water through spraying, misting, and splashing.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is also on board, trying to find out whether exposure came from inside [nosocomial] or outside the hospital [community-acquired].

People with weak immune systems are more vulnerable to _Legionella_ infection, but it is not necessarily transmitted person-to-person.

The recommendation is for high-risk patients to avoid exposure to tap water at Queen's.

The Health Department has confirmed that one patient being treated for Legionnaire's disease has died. Two others are hospitalized, and one is still recovering at The Queen's Medical Center.

Officials told KHON2 that the water sampling was done on Tuesday [19 Jun 2018], and it could take a week to get the results.

Legionnaires' disease can cause severe pneumonia and can be deadly in some cases.

Officials say this is the 1st hospital in Hawaii to ever test for the _Legionella_ bacteria. "Here in Hawaii, this is fortunately, unfortunately, the 1st instance. It is something that, going forward just like every other state and every other jurisdiction, we are looking at much more closely," said Dr. Sarah Park, state epidemiologist.

Queen's says it is working with the Hawaii State Department of Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to investigate these cases and all potential sources of _Legionella_ exposure within and outside of the hospital. The Hawaii State Department of Health told KHON2 it collected environmental samples at Queen's Medical Center.

In the meantime, a spokesperson for the hospital says Queen's is proactively asking all healthcare providers to take additional precautions with patients who are at greatest risk of contracting the disease. It's recommending that high-risk patients avoid exposure to tap water in any form at Queen's. Under state and federal guidelines, that means they are avoiding:
- drinking water from a fountain,
- using ice from the ice machine,
- taking showers,
- and flushing their toilets.

We're told there have been no closures at the hospital at this time. "If you look at other cases of Legionnaires' disease at other hospitals across the nation, that is normally the case. It's very rare that you would close down a hospital system; that's quite a severe case," said Dr. Park.

Queen's says it has taken a number of measures to ensure the safety and wellbeing of patients and staff, some of which include increased chlorination of water, increased surveillance, water cultures and testing in conjunction with DOH and water experts, scheduled running of showers and faucets as part of routine room cleaning, and replacement of laminar flow devices on faucets.

"That's the thing at the bottom of the faucet that prevents the spraying out in all directions. So that's the last point of contact when water comes out of the pipe," said Dr. Erlaine Bello, the medical director of the infection control department at Queen's.

_Legionella_ is spread through water that has been aerosolized. It is most likely to occur in people who have weakened immune systems. It is not readily transmissible from person to person. _Legionella_ is found in water and soil, and most people exposed to the bacteria do not become ill. You can get it by inhaling the bacteria through water sources like showers and air conditioners. "It's a matter of just reminding everyone that we have to maintain our water system," said Dr. Park, "but especially in our hospitals, because, as I said earlier, these are our people that are at highest risk."

The Hawaii State Department of Health said the 4 cases are still under investigation, and it's working to determine whether the cases are linked with a common source of infection. The DOH also included this statement:

"The Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) is investigating additional suspected cases of Legionnaires' disease in 4 Honolulu residents and is working closely with health care partners and Queen's Medical Center. Prevention measures are in place, and environmental samples have been collected and are being tested to identify possible sources of the disease. DOH is working closely with QMC and other partners to ensure the health and safety of patients and staff."

We're told that 2 of the [legionellosis] cases may have happened outside of Queen's. Water samples at the hospital were taken Tuesday [19 Jun 2018] to find out whether the other 2 may have gotten [legionellosis] after they were admitted.

"It does appear right now that that may be the case; hence, part of our investigation is focusing on the facility here, but we haven't ruled out all potential issues, and, again, it's very early in the investigation," said Dr. Park.

[_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacteria that embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and containers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers, and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ becomes undetectable by culture of the hospital water.

Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates. More information on the outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as it becomes available. - Mod.ML
