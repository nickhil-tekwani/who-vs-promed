Strange how things remain the same although they change. It is only six or
seven years ago that a similar incident happened in Norway, fortunately
without any accidental spread. You mentioned the need for dipstick tests
for anthrax: I still insist that all the veterinarians we train with the
Norwegian Army should be able to make a blood smear and use Loeffler's
methylene blue/polychrome methylene blue and a microscope. The procedure
takes about ten minutes and is at least as precise as any dipstick test (if
they were available).
In my view one should not forget (or indeed discard) the "old" tests and
procedures: had they been followed this case and others would have been
diagnosed, the carcass would not have been opened and spore production
reduced. The microscope is still a very versatile and useful tool, and with
the minimum of knowledge that one should have, a few different stains and a
few minutes you can actually do field, "on the spot" diagnoses on quite a
few diseases: At least you get an indication. You don't even need a
computer (except to get your ProMED-mail, of course!)

[I don't disagree with the Norwegian military experience, if only because
when I qualified in 1960 every UK large animal vet carried a microscope and
the appropriate stains in the boot (US = trunk) of his car to examine blood
smears on site when examining an unexpected livestock death. I witnessed
their frequent use up to the early 1970s. Unfortunately, that is not the
current experience in the USA or, I suspect, in many countries these days.
I have been told by Peter Turnbull that Loeffler's methylene blue is
essentially unobtainable now in the UK. Other than to the Norwegian
military, the only other country where I know of its ready availability is
Azerbaijan, or so I was forcefully informed personally last year in Almaty
by their CVO. The old tests are still good IF you have the materials to
hand and training. Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED AHEAD moderator.
