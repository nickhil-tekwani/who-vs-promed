The Government has launched a 10-day mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever disease in Isiolo County as well as parts of the neighboring Garissa County.

This follows an outbreak of the disease in parts of Isiolo in March this year [2022], with 71 reported cases and 7 fatalities so far.

Speaking in Isiolo town Saturday [23 Jul 2022] while launching the campaign, Acting Director General for Health Dr Patrick Amoth said that the mass vaccination drive will target all people aged 9 months to 60 years, even as he called on residents in the targeted areas to take advantage of the free vaccination campaign and get immunized.

He said that all the 3 sub counties of Isiolo have reported yellow fever cases, with Merti and Garbatulla being most affected.

Dr Amoth assured members of the public of the safety of the yellow fever jab, asking them to dispel any rumors to the effect that the vaccine could harm them in any way.

He noted that a single dose of the vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and life-long protection against the disease.

Amoth further challenged county governments to ensure immunization coverage for other vaccines remains high to prevent outbreaks of diseases including having all children under 5 years receive 2 doses of measles Rubella vaccine to reduce the risk of measles outbreaks.

According to Dr Sergon Kibet from the World Health Organisation, the vaccination campaign is important in protecting the lives of the vulnerable population, urging all eligible persons in the targeted areas to turn up and ensure that they get the yellow fever jab before the 10 days' campaign ends.

Isiolo County Deputy Governor Dr Abdi Issa said that the mass vaccination campaign marked a critical milestone in ongoing efforts to eradicate the disease that causes widespread illness and death, even as he urged the political class to desist from politicizing healthcare issues.

He noted that the highly infectious disease leads to the death of almost 50% of those infected if they do not access early medical attention, making it one of the most dangerous diseases.

Dr Issa also called upon the members of the public to protect themselves against mosquito bites by sleeping in treated nets as well as clearing bushes around their homesteads in order to destroy breeding grounds for the pests.

The campaign is set to cover the entire Isiolo County as well as 2 sub-counties of Lagdera and Balambala in the neighboring county of Garissa, targeting over 700 000 people.

[Yellow fever (YF) virus transmission has continued in Isiolo county, although with a small number of cases. During the period 12 Jan to 15 Mar 2022, there was a total of 53 suspected yellow fever cases, including 6 deaths. Now the number of reported cases is 71, with 7 deaths. The emergency vaccination campaign has begun in the affected and neighboring localities. Although attempts at vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites that are mentioned in the report are prudent, vaccination is more effective at preventing YF virus transmission. Although the Acting Director General for Health mentions the eradication of YF, the virus will persist in the endemic natural sylvan (forest) transmission cycles. A successful vaccination campaign will, however, end human cases. - Mod.TY
