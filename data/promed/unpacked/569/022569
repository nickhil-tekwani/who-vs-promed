Powassan virus infection likely acquired through blood transfusion presenting as encephalitis in a kidney transplant recipient.

Abstract
--------
A kidney transplant patient without known tick exposure developed encephalitis 3 weeks after transplantation. During the transplant hospitalization, the patient had received a blood transfusion from an asymptomatic donor later discovered to have been infected with Powassan virus. This report describes a probable instance of transfusion-transmitted Powassan virus infection.

[Although tick transmission is by far the commonest means by which humans acquire Powassan virus infection, the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that Powassan virus can be transmitted through blood transfusions. People with confirmed Powassan virus infections should not donate blood for 6 months after their illness. Powassan virus infections temporally associated with blood transfusion should be reported promptly to the appropriate state health department (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/treatment-prevention.html).

Although the location where this blood-related transmission occurred is not stated, it appears to be Wisconsin. Powassan virus is endemic there and transmitted by the blacklegged or deer tick, _Ixodes scapularis_. The Powassan virus variant there (lineage 2) is often referred to as deer tick virus. From 2009-2018 there have been 25 cases of Powassan virus infection in Wisconsin reported to CDC. Although ProMED-mail has not reported cases of Powassan virus infection in Wisconsin before, it has posted a case in the neighboring state of Minnesota (see Powassan virus, encephalitis - USA: (MN) fatal 20110701.2003). - Mod.TY
