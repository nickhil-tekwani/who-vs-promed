E.COLI - UK (SCOTLAND & ENGLAND)

A new outbreak of _E. coli O157_ is reported by The Herald in Glasgow,
Scotland -- a total of 30 cases, all of which are either hospital patients,
visitors or staff members. Also, there are four new cases (no hospital
locus) in England -- two in Bradford and two in Birmingham. Preliminary
studies in Scotland indicate that the new outbreak is caused by a different
strain of the bacteria than the one that caused 19 deaths last year. The
English cases are children ranging from 12 months to six years. There have
been no deaths, but two elderly patients in Scotland are said to be severely
weakened.
