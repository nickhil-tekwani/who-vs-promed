Disease outbreak forces pig cull
--------------------------------
Hundreds of pigs will be slaughtered in a bid to contain a fatal pig
disease found in New Zealand for the first time. But it seems too late to
eradicate the disease, post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS),
which does not threaten human health.
The disease, which affects piglets that have recently been weaned, has
killed a number of animals in the Waikato.
Pork Industry Board chief executive Angus Davidson said a final decision
had not been made on whether to kill all 480 sows and their offspring on 3
North Island farms where the disease had been found. The farmers involved
had agreed to the cull in principle, and the board was now discussing
compensation with them.
"From the information we have from the Northern Hemisphere, we have to try
and contain it, but this gives us only a 50-50 chance," he said.
Most of the pigs would be slaughtered through abattoirs and their meat
sold. There was no risk to human health and no food safety issues from
PMWS, which would have no effect on the price of pork.
The disease was "right through" Europe and North America, said Mr Davidson.
A Waikato farm is understood to have lost at least 1/3 of its piglets in
the initial outbreak, revealed in September 2003, and 15 farms in the North
Island have been investigated.
The ministry is restricting the movement of pigs and pig semen between the
North and South Island. But it said the disease could not be eradicated.
