Why omicron might stick around
------------------------------
Omicron, the 13th named variant of the coronavirus, seems to have a remarkable capacity to evolve new tricks.

Where is Pi?
------------
Last year [2021], the World Health Organization began assigning Greek letters to worrying new variants of the coronavirus. The organization started with alpha and swiftly worked its way through the Greek alphabet in the months that followed. When omicron arrived in November [2021], it was the 13th named variant in less than a year.

But 10 months have passed since omicron's debut, and the next letter in line, pi, has yet to arrive.

That does not mean SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, has stopped evolving. But it may have entered a new stage. Last year [2021], more than a dozen ordinary viruses independently transformed into major new public health threats. But now, all of the virus's most significant variations are descending from a single lineage: omicron.

"Based on what's being detected at the moment, it's looking like future SARS-CoV-2 will evolve from omicron," said David Robertson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow.

It's also looking like omicron has a remarkable capacity for more evolution. One of the newest subvariants, called BA.2.75.2, can evade immune responses better than all earlier forms of omicron.

For now, BA.2.75.2 is extremely rare, making up just 0.05% of the coronaviruses that have been sequenced worldwide in the past 3 months. But that was once true of other omicron subvariants that later came to dominate the world. If BA.2.75.2 becomes widespread this winter [2022], it may blunt the effectiveness of the newly authorized boosters from Moderna and Pfizer.

Every time SARS-CoV-2 replicates inside of a cell, it might mutate. On rare occasions, a mutation might help SARS-CoV-2 replicate faster. Or it might help the virus evade antibodies from previous bouts of COVID.

Such a beneficial mutation might become more common in a single country before fading away. Or it might take over the world.

At first, SARS-CoV-2 followed the slow and steady course that scientists had expected based on other coronaviruses. Its evolutionary tree gradually split into branches, each gaining a few mutations. Evolutionary biologists kept track of them with codes that were useful but obscure. No one else paid much attention to the codes, because they made little difference to how sick the viruses made people.

But then one lineage, initially known as B.1.1.7, defied expectations. When British scientists discovered it, in December 2020, they were surprised to find it bore a unique sequence of 23 mutations. Those mutations allowed it to spread much faster than other versions of the virus.

Within a few months, several other worrying variants came to light around the world -- each with its own combination of mutations, each with the potential to spread quickly and cause a surge of deaths. To make it easier to communicate about them, the W.H.O. came up with its Greek system. B.1.1.7 became alpha.

Different variants experienced varying levels of success. Alpha came to dominate the world, whereas beta took over only in South Africa and a few other countries before petering out.

What made the variants even more puzzling was that they arose independently. Beta did not descend from alpha. Instead, it arose with its own set of new mutations from a different branch of the SARS-CoV-2 tree. The same held true for all the Greek-named variants, up to omicron.

It's likely that most of these variants got their mutations by going into hiding. Instead of jumping from one host to another, they created chronic infections in people with weakened immune systems.

Unable to mount a strong attack, these victims harbored the virus for months, allowing it to accumulate mutations. When it eventually emerged from its host, the virus had a startling range of new abilities -- finding new ways to invade cells, weaken the immune system and evade antibodies.

"When it gets out, it's like an invasive species," said Ben Murrell, a computational biologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

Omicron did particularly well in this genetic lottery, gaining more than 50 new mutations that helped it find new routes into cells and to infect people who had been vaccinated or previously infected. As it spread around the world and caused an unprecedented spike in cases, it drove most other variants to extinction.

"The genetic innovations seen in omicron were far more profound, as if it was a new species rather than just a new strain," said Darren Martin, a virologist at the University of Cape Town.

But it soon became clear that the name "omicron" hid a complex reality. After the original omicron virus evolved in the fall of 2021, its descendants split into at least 5 branches, known as BA.1 through BA.5. Over the next few months, the subvariants took turns rising to dominance. BA.1 went first, but it was soon outcompeted by BA.2. Each one was distinct enough from the others to evade some of the immunity of its predecessors. By this summer [2022], BA.5 was on the rise.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration responded by inviting vaccine makers to produce booster shots that included a BA.5 protein along with one from the original version of the virus. Those boosters are now rolling out to the public, at a time when BA.5 is causing 85% of all COVID cases in the United States.

But BA.5 could be fading in the rearview mirror by winter [2022], scientists said. Omicron has continued to evolve -- likely by sometimes jumping among hosts, and sometimes hiding for months in one of them.

Since these new lineages belong to omicron, they haven't gotten a Greek letter of their own. But that doesn't mean they're just a slight twist on the original. Antibodies that could latch onto earlier forms of omicron fare poorly against the newer ones. ...

Abstract
--------
"Several sublineages of omicron have emerged with additional mutations that may afford further antibody evasion. Here, we characterise the sensitivity of emerging omicron sublineages BA.2.75.2, BA.4.6, and BA.2.10.4 to antibody-mediated neutralisation, and identify extensive escape by BA.2.75.2. BA.2.75.2 was resistant to neutralisation by Evusheld (tixagevimab + cilgavimab), but remained sensitive to bebtelovimab. In recent serum samples from blood donors in Stockholm, Sweden, BA.2.75.2 was neutralised, on average, 5-fold less potently than BA.5, representing the most neutralisation resistant variant evaluated to date. These data raise concerns that BA.2.75.2 may effectively evade humoral immunity in the population."

Abstract
--------
"Continuous evolution of omicron has led to numerous subvariants that exhibits growth advantage over BA.5. Such rapid and simultaneous emergence of variants with enormous advantages is unprecedented. Despite their rapidly divergent evolutionary courses, mutations on their receptor-binding domain (RBD) converge on several hotspots, including R346, R356, K444, L452, N460K and F486. The driving force and destination of such convergent evolution and its impact on humoral immunity established by vaccination and infection remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that these convergent mutations can cause striking evasion of convalescent plasma, including those from BA.5 breakthrough infection, and existing antibody drugs, including Evusheld and Bebtelovimab. BA.2.75.2 is the most evasive strain tested, and only BQ.1.1 could compare. To clarify the origin of the convergent evolution, we determined the escape mutation profiles and neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from convalescents of BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough infection. Importantly, due to humoral immune imprinting, BA.2 and especially BA.5 breakthrough infection caused significant reductions of neutralizing antibody epitope diversity and increased proportion of non-neutralizing mAbs, which in turn concentrated humoral immune pressure and promoted the convergent RBD evolution. Additionally, the precise convergent RBD mutations and evolution trends of BA.2.75/BA.5 subvariants could be inferred by integrating the neutralization-weighted DMS profiles of mAbs from various immune histories (3051 mAbs in total). Moreover, we demonstrated that as few as 5 additional convergent mutations based on BA.5 or BA.2.75 could completely evade most plasma samples, including those from BA.5 breakthrough infections, while remaining sufficient hACE2-binding affinity. These results suggest herd immunity established by natural infection could hardly stop RBD evolution, and vaccine boosters using BA.5 may not provide sufficiently broad protection. Broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and NAb drugs development should be in high priority and the constructed convergent mutants could serve to examine their effectiveness in advance." - Mod.LK]

[2] Infants < 1 year old
Date: Sun 25 Sep 2022
Source: Inside Medicine [abridged, edited]
https://insidemedicine.bulletin.com/infants-are-being-hospitalized-with-covid-at-higher-rates-than-most-adults-and-seniors


The risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 rises with age. Children are the least likely to be hospitalized or die, followed by young and middle-aged adults, followed by seniors. In 2021, if you were age 85 and older, you were over 1800-times more likely to die of COVID-19 than children ages 1-17 were.

But there's an age group that often gets overlooked: infants under 1 year of age. Infants under age 1 are a high-risk group flying under the radar. And it's getting worse.

Infants under age 1 account for nearly a third of pediatric COVID mortality in children under age 12. Within that age group, however, the 1st 6 months of life are particularly dangerous. During the pandemic, over 1% of all infants followed by COVID-NET (the CDC's tracker which covers around 10% of the US population) have been hospitalized for or with COVID during their 1st 6 months of life. (The actual reported rate is 1255 COVID-associated hospitalizations per 100 000 infants ages 0-5 months old). That's around 78% as high as the rate observed in 50-64-year-olds during the pandemic.

This next piece of information will shock you, as it shocked me. During the peak of early omicron, and for much of the summer of 2022, infants ages 0-5 months were hospitalized at a higher rate than even 65-74-year-olds -- that is, at a higher rate than any age group, other than seniors ages 75 and older.

Why is this happening? There are 2 likely explanations. First, these babies are fragile by definition. The 1st days and weeks of life are dangerous times. Though medicine has made colossal strides in reducing morbidity and mortality from all causes in newborns in the last century, the 1st year of life remains a high-risk period. Second, newborns are far less likely to have any immunity to COVID; they're too young to have been vaccinated and they weren't around for the last 30 months, during which a majority of Americans were infected with COVID and now, at least, have some protective immunity to show for it. This is why on the graphs, we see that the hospitalization rate in newborns has been accruing at a steeper rate since the early omicron wave compared to all age groups (other than the oldest seniors, who clearly need more protection). Most of us have some degree of immunity to COVID by now, be it from infection, vaccination, or both. But newborns have no immune memory to this virus, and they just keep coming.

What can we do about it? Starting at age 6 months, children should be vaccinated. This should happen as soon as possible. That helps because, after the 1st 6 months of life, the 2nd riskiest time for children to get COVID is the next 6 months (that's in terms of mortality -- we don't have hospitalization data for 6-12-month old babies, because that group gets lumped in with all kids up to age 4). But that doesn't fix the problem in babies under 6 months of age.

To protect newborns, there are 3 actions we can take. First, we should ask the public to mask in crowded public settings like busses and subways, especially during surges. Parents don't have a choice in these areas, and we should band together to help their babies through these risk corridors. Second, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna should begin to study vaccination safety and efficacy in newborns younger than 6 months of age. Third, pregnant mothers should receive COVID vaccinations or booster doses during the 2nd half of pregnancy, as antibodies passed from mother to fetus seem to be protective to babies during the 1st few months of their lives.

Researchers also need to study whether babies of recently vaccinated (or infected) mothers who breastfeed fare better, as research implies but has not yet shown definitively. Protective COVID antibodies in breastmilk line babies' mucous membranes, where this virus likes to enter our bodies. It's probable that breastfeeding provides a short-term layer of protection with each feeding. So for those who can't breastfeed, donor milk from recently vaccinated mothers should be considered. [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2209651]

Vaccinating children has been controversial, although not for any particularly good reason. The main arguments put forth by doubters are that COVID does not seem to be that harmful to children, and misinterpretations (intentional or unintentional) of data on vaccine safety (they're safe). ...

[3] CIDRAP news: life span, mental health, pediatric cases
Date: Tue 27 Sep 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/09/report-covid-19-has-lowered-lifespan-across-americas


Report: COVID-19 has lowered lifespan across the Americas
---------------------------------------------------------
A report today [27 Sep 2022] from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) shows that COVID-19 reduced life expectancy across the Americas while amplifying economic inequities and existing health disparities. [https://iris.paho.org/handle/10665.2/56472]

The publication, "Health in the Americas 2022," assessed the health status of the region 2 years after the pandemic began.

The Americas house 13% of the world's population, but the region has recorded 37% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 45% of deaths globally.

Health expectancy across the region fell to levels not seen since 2004. Life expectancy in Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 75.1 years in 2019 to 72.2 in 2021, a decline of 2.9 years. In North America, expected lifespan dropped from 79.5 years in 2019 to 77.7 in 2021, or by 1.8 years.

In addition to declining life expectancy, both routine childhood immunization levels and mental health diagnoses have suffered under the veil of COVID-19. The number of vaccines administered to children has fallen dramatically, with routine complete immunization for the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine falling 3.6% between 2019 and 2021 (from 84% to 81%). Complete uptake of the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine declined from 75% to 68%, or 9.3%.

Mental health needs increase as services drop
---------------------------------------------
The prevalence of depression has increased by 27.6%, and anxiety by 25.7%, relative to pre-pandemic levels, PAHO said. At the same time, 93% of countries in the region reported having significant disruptions in essential health services.

Notably, the authors of the report suggest the disruption in health services led to 1.7 million unplanned pregnancies, resulting in nearly 800 000 abortions, 2900 maternal deaths, and nearly 39 000 infant deaths, representing a setback equivalent to 20-30 years of progress in this field.

In conclusion, the report suggests that, while most countries in the region sought a comprehensive response to the pandemic, "One of the greatest challenges was to coordinate the response in a context of high fragmentation at the government level and lack of critical resources in the health system."

US pediatric COVID cases drop
-----------------------------
In other COVID-19 news, child COVID-19 cases declined for the 4th consecutive week in the United States, with 55 000 reported for the week ending 22 Sep 2022, according to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics. [https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/]

In the past 6 months, weekly pediatric cases have fluctuated between a low of 55 000 cases and a high of about 112 000 cases. Overall 14.7 million American children have tested positive for the virus during the pandemic -- almost half of whom tested positive this year [2022].

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 52 539, with 417 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker. [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html]

Yesterday [26 Sep 2022] the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it has authorized an additional 5 batches of Moderna's updated bivalent booster shots made at a facility in Indiana after it deemed them safe for use, Reuters reports. Moderna has requested the use of these vaccines to boost supply, as the government has ordered more than 170 million updated vaccine doses for this fall [2022], in preparation for a revaccination campaign. [https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-clears-additional-lots-modernas-covid-booster-amid-shortage-2022-09-26/]

And today [27 Sep 2022] the FDA updated its COVID test policy that has a goal of continued access to tests while encouraging developers to seek approval through the pre-COVID pathways.

"Taking into account the current status of manufacturing capacity and consumer access given the Administration's important investments in tests, for most new tests, shifting to traditional premarket review would best meet the public health needs at the current stage of the COVID-19 public health emergency," said Jeff Shuren, MD, JD, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health in a press statement.

[4] Adipose/fat tissue

https://scienceblog.com/533860/sars-cov-2-infects-fat-tissue-creates-inflammatory-storm-cloud/?utm_campaign=ScienceBlog.com&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newslette


SARS-CoV-2 infects fat cells and induces inflammation
-----------------------------------------------------
A study by Stanford Medicine investigators shows that SARS-CoV-2 can infect human fat tissue. This phenomenon was seen in laboratory experiments conducted on fat tissue excised from patients undergoing bariatric and cardiac surgeries, and later infected in a laboratory dish with SARS-CoV-2. It was further confirmed in autopsy samples from deceased COVID-19 patients.

Obesity is an established, independent risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as for the patients' progression, once infected, to severe disease and death. Reasons offered for this increased vulnerability range from impaired breathing resulting from the pressure of extra weight, to altered immune responsiveness in obese people.

But the new study provides a more direct reason: SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can directly infect adipose tissue (which most of us refer to as just plain "fat"). That, in turn, cooks up a cycle of viral replication within resident fat cells, or adipocytes, and causes pronounced inflammation in immune cells that hang out in fat tissue. The inflammation converts even uninfected "bystander" cells within the tissue into an inflammatory state...

The findings are described in a study published online 22 Sep 2022 in Science Translational Medicine. [Martínez-Colón GJ, Ratnasiri K, Chen H, et al. SARS-CoV-2 infection drives an inflammatory response in human adipose tissue through infection of adipocytes and macrophages. Sci Transl Med. 2022 Sep 22:eabm9151. doi: 10.1126/scitranslmed.abm9151. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 36137009.]...

Oddly, ACE2 -- the cell surface molecule that's been implicated as the cardinal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 -- appeared to play little or no role in the ability of the virus to infect fat cells.

The method by which SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to fat cells and macrophages in fat tissue remains mysterious. ...

Fat tissue's potential to serve as a reservoir where SARS-CoV-2 can hide out also raises the possibility that it could contribute to the enduring post-infection symptoms collectively called long COVID, a hypothesis that McLaughlin and Blish are beginning to explore. ...
