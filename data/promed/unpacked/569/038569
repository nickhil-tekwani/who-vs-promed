Circulation of bovine ephemeral fever in the Middle East
--------------------------------------------------------
Bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) is an economically important arbovirus of cattle. The main routes of its transmission between countries and continents are not completely elucidated. This study aimed to explore BEFV transmission in the Middle East. A phylogenetic analysis was performed on the gene encoding the G protein of BEFV isolates from Israel from 2000 and 2008 with isolates from Turkey (2008), Egypt (2005), Australia (1968-1998) and East Asia (1966-2004).

Calf sera collected during the years 2006-2007 were tested by serum neutralization in order to explore for recent exposure to BEFV before 2008. These were followed by a meteorological analysis, aimed to reveal movement of air parcels into Israel in the 2 weeks preceding the 1st case of BEF in Israel in 2008. The 2008 Israeli and Turkish isolates showed 99 percent identity and formed a new cluster with the 2000 Israeli isolate. The serological survey showed no new exposure to BEFV during 2006 and 2007. These results coincided with the meteorological analysis, which revealed that air parcels originating in Southern Turkey had reached the location of outbreak onset in Israel 9 days before the discovery of the index case.

The Egyptian isolate clustered phylogenetically with the Taiwanese isolates, coinciding with data on importation of cattle from China to the Middle East in the year preceding the isolation of the Egyptian isolates. These results suggest that both winds and animal transport may have an important role in trans-boundary transmission of BEFV.

[The above paper was accepted for publication by Vet Microbiology on 1 Mar 2012, available on-line 8 Mar 2012. In view of the exceptional findings regarding the circumstantial/hypothesized evidence for the long-distance/intercontinental transmission of BEFV from China to the Middle East (Egypt), we copy herewith (1) a passage from the discussion chapter. In addition, (2) the conclusions chapter. References, respective to both passages, are included.

(1). "An interesting finding presented in this study is the similarity of the Egyptian isolate from 2005 with the 2004 Taiwanese isolate. Outbreaks of BEF have been previously reported in Taiwan (Hsieh et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2001). The disease has also been reported in China (Wenbin et al., 1991), including some recent occurrences in parts of China, although their exact timing was not stated (Qiu et al., 2010). The distance between Taiwan or China and the Middle East is about 7000-8000 km, which is about 10 times the distance between Turkey and Israel. Thus, transmission of BEFV by winds from East Asia to the Middle East is unlikely.

"Unfortunately, reports of cattle import by Egypt in 2004 are not available. However, according to the FAO, China reported the export of 6000 cattle heads to Jordan. This coincided with a Chinese press report from 2004
(http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-09/22/content_376544.htm) claiming that in September of that year, China exported 1800 cattle heads to Jordan from Hebei province, an area which had previously suffered from large outbreaks of BEF (Zhongguo et al., 1992). It is therefore likely that in 2004, BEFV was transmitted from East Asia to the Middle East via the transport of infected animals."

(2). "The results of this study support the existence of 2 possible transmission routes for arboviruses within and into the Middle East: winds and animal transport. It therefore emphasizes the importance of integrated surveillance combined with international communication and transparency to prevent the spread of diseases. It should be mentioned, however, that this study does not aim to quantify the risk of such transmission routes.

"Extensive work on models for arbovirus dispersion by winds have been published recently and may help in quantifying the risk of BEFV transmission in the Middle-East as well as its invasion to other geographical locations, including Europe. [for references, see the original paper]. Further analysis of BEFV isolates from Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East as well as investigation of its potential vectors are also needed to increase our understanding of the spread and circulation of this virus which, apart for being economically important, might also serve as a good example for the global spread of arboviruses of livestock."
