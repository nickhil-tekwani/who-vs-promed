A severe loss of livestock during winter: Lumpy skin disease in cattle, which emerged in May 2022, has spread to around 30 provinces [in Afghanistan]. As of December [2022], 125 000 cattle have been vaccinated against the disease, and the FAO [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] plans to vaccinate 3 975 000 more by July [2023]. Untreated, this disease can result in low milk yield, reducing farmers' income.

[The above report rhymes with the following forecast addressing the lumpy skin disease (LSD) vaccination project, published in FAO's Afghanistan Newsletter No. 29, which covered the 3rd quarter of 2022 (https://www.fao.org/3/cc2841en/cc2841en.pdf):

"FAO has procured 125 000 doses of LSD vaccines and they are currently [October/November 2022] being implemented in 11 provinces through private sector Veterinary Field Units (VFUs). The VFUs provide vaccinations, deworming and the treatment of special conditions and ectoparasites for all species of livestock. There are up 1200 functioning VFU facilities across the country, and FAO is working with 100 of them for LSD vaccination in the 11 provinces during the 1st phase of administering the vaccine. Over 3 million cows across Afghanistan's 34 provinces need to be vaccinated, which is around 80% of the total cattle in the country."

The event in Afghanistan started, reportedly, in May 2022 in the provinces of Laghman and Kandahar, bordering Pakistan. As observed in relation to other transboundary livestock diseases, in particular foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), the eastern regions of Afghanistan can be considered an extension of the western Pakistan ecosystem because the 2 regions are linked by contiguous livestock populations, transhumance routes, and 2-way trade and fattening enterprises (http://164.115.40.47/Portals/0/Combining%20livestock%20trade%20patterns%20with.pdf). - Mod.AS
