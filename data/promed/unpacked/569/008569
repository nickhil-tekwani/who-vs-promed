["The causal organism of European foulbrood of honey bees (EFB) is the bacterium _Melissococcus plutonius_. The identification of its presence by the observation of signs of disease in the field is unreliable. The most usual and obvious sign is the death of larvae shortly before they are due to be sealed in their cells, but this may be for reasons other than European foulbrood. Most infected colonies display few visible signs, which themselves often quickly abate spontaneously before the end of each active season. Infection remains enzootic within individual colonies because of mechanical contamination of the honeycombs by the durable organism. Recurrences of disease can therefore be expected in subsequent years."

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references please refer to the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.3 on EFB at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.03_EUROPEAN_FOULB.pdf

An infected colony may show some or all of the signs below:
- erratic or uneven brood pattern;
- twisted larvae with creamy-white guts visible through the body wall;
- melted down, yellowy white larvae;
- an unpleasant sour odour;
- loosely-attached brown scales

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to Infection of honey bees with _Melissococcus plutonius_ (European foulbrood) are detailed in chapter 9.3. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.9.3.htm

Quantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database section "Detailed country(ies) disease incidence", indicates that Belgium reported on August 2009 one outbreak of EFB in the West- Vlaanderen region. This information and additional data on this outbreak can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view the information scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the region, and time period).

According to the information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist) 27 of 178 OIE Member countries have provided some information related to EFB (this information is based on the most recent 6-monthly report sent by the countries). Of these 27 countries, the disease was reported in 11 European countries.
