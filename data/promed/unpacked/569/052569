The US measles epidemic has surpassed 1000 cases, health officials said, marking the highest level in nearly 27 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its count on Wednesday [5 Jun 2019], saying 1001 illnesses have been reported since the beginning of the year [2019].

Most are from outbreaks in New York in Orthodox Jewish communities. The nation last saw this many cases in 1992, when more than 2200 were reported.

"The Department of Health and Human Services has been deeply engaged in promoting the safety and effectiveness of vaccines, amid concerning signs that there are pockets of undervaccination around the country," Alex Azar, US Health and Human Services secretary, said in a statement. "The 1000th case of a preventable disease like measles is a troubling reminder of how important that work is to the public health of the nation," he added.

Measles became rare after vaccination campaigns started in the 1960s. A decade ago, there were fewer than 100 cases a year. While overall vaccination rates have remained fairly high, outbreaks have been happening in communities where parents have refused recommended shots for their children.

The latest figures were updated after the agency initially reported 20 fewer cases on Monday [3 Jun 2019].

"We cannot say this enough: Vaccines are a safe and highly effective public health tool that can prevent this disease and end the current outbreak," the health secretary continued in his statement. "The measles vaccine is among the most-studied medical products we have and is given safely to millions of children and adults each year," he added. "I encourage all Americans to talk to your doctor about what vaccines are recommended to protect you, your family, and your community from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases."

[2] USA: measles cases continue to increase
Date: Mon 3 Jun 2019

http://kobi5.com/news/measles-cases-continue-to-increase-103310/


Confirmed cases of the measles continue to creep up. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reporting that there are now 981 cases in 26 states as of last Friday [31 May 2019]. That is an increase of 41 cases from the previous week.

Over 800 of the cases are in New York, and the majority of those were in people who not vaccinated. This is the most cases reported in the country since 1992. The agency warned last week that the USA may lose its measles elimination status if the outbreak continues through the summer and the fall.

The disease was declared eliminated back in 2000.

The states that have reported cases to CDC are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee, and Washington.

[3] USA: measles outbreaks put USA at risk of losing prized "elimination" status
Date: Tue 4 Jun 2019
Source: STAT Morning Rounds [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/06/04/measles-outbreaks-put-u-s-at-risk-of-losing-prized-elimination-status/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&utm_campaign=b4567a3557-MR_COPY_08&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-b4567a3557-125542229


With 2 large and still growing outbreaks in New York pushing the country's measles count to a quarter-century high, public health officials are starting to grapple with an unpleasant prospect. The Rockland County and Brooklyn outbreaks have dragged on for 8 months. If transmission from either of those outbreaks continues until late September [2019], the USA will likely lose a hard-fought and prized status -- that of a country deemed to have "eliminated" measles.

And if that happens -- Venezuela and Brazil are the only other countries in the Americas where measles is considered endemic, or constantly circulating -- the implications could be profound, experts say.

While there would be no international penalties involved, the rollback of measles elimination status would mean more than just the crossing of a psychological divide. It would be a harbinger, experts say, that the USA could face far larger outbreaks in the future -- epidemics that could strain the capacity of health departments that already struggle to extinguish each and every chain of measles transmission that occurs in the country.

"An ounce of prevention is a ton of work," said Dr. Thomas Clark, deputy director of the division of viral diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who has been thinking about what might happen if the USA loses its measles-free status in the fall.

"In practice, you can't respond the way our local health departments are responding to 20, and 30, and 50 cases a week," Clark said. "If you have hundreds, you're not calling everybody. You're not seeing who they exposed. You're not recommending individuals isolate themselves in case they come down with measles. You just have endemic measles. You just understand that everybody's at some risk of measles from people who are unvaccinated."

Is that where the USA is heading? Clark and others wonder.

"Do we reach a place where measles is acceptable? And some rare but real case fatality from measles is OK despite having safe and effective vaccines," he mused. "That's not a place we want to get back to. We don't want to slide back down to measles being endemic in the United States."

After measles vaccines came onto the market in the 1960s, several efforts were made to stop transmission of the virus in this country. Those, after all, were the heady days when major breakthroughs in vaccine development -- 1st polio, then measles -- were opening up new vistas for disease control. The ultimately successful campaign to rid the world of smallpox was launched. Infectious diseases could be prevented.

Two attempts to stop measles transmission in the USA -- the 1st in the 1960s, the 2nd in the 1970s and early 1980s -- failed, said Dr. Walter Orenstein, who was the director of the US Immunization Program from 1988 to 2004. But those failures pointed to problems that needed to be addressed, and galvanized the collective will to get the job done, he said. A 3rd attempt, in the 1990s, succeeded, and the country was declared measles-free in 2000.

[4] USA: homeopathic alternatives to vaccination
Date: Fri 7 Jun 2019
Source: The Guardian [abridged, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/07/homeopathic-therapies-prevent-measles-cure-autism


Thousands of American children are being put on homeopathic alternatives to vaccination by practitioners who claim they can prevent measles and "cure" autism, the Guardian has learned. At least 200 homeopaths in the USA are practicing a controversial "therapy" known as Cease that falsely asserts that it has the power to treat and even cure autism. The acronym stands for Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression.

The "therapy" relies in part on administering high doses of vitamin C. Advocates falsely say it repairs the harm caused by vaccination -- a double untruth, as most vaccines are safe and there is no link between vaccines and autism, a condition for which there is no cure.

In addition, 250 homeopaths, some of whom also practice Cease, are promoting "homeoprophylaxis" that advertises itself as an "immunological education program". More than 2000 American children have been put on the program, which claims to build natural immunity against infectious diseases, though there is no scientific evidence that it works.

Parents who opt to follow Cease or homeoprophylaxis are potentially exposing their children, as well as others around them, to life-threatening illness. The implicit message behind both therapies is that vaccines are harmful and should be avoided.

The spread of such ideas, amplified through the proliferation of anti-vaxxer theories on social media, has begun to have a profound impact on public health in the USA. Last month [May 2019], the number of measles cases reached a 25-year peak. A leading advocate of both programs is Kate Birch, a homeopath based in Minnesota who said she imported homeoprophylaxis into the USA in 2008 having learnt about it in Cuba. She has trained 250 practitioners in its thinking, 80 of whom she still supervises.

She added that there are now some 2000 children across America under their direction.

Birch's organization, Free and Healthy Children, is constituted as a 501(c)3 public education charity, allowing it to operate free of federal tax. On its website it clearly states its anti-vaccine ideology, proclaiming that its members "are concerned about the alarming incidence of immune system disturbances and developmental delays affecting so many children as a result of the current-day vaccination programs".

An associated website run by Birch, vaccinefree, claims that "homeopathic remedies can be used preventatively for measles".

In an interview with the Guardian, Birch said that homeoprophylaxis strengthened children's immunity to infectious diseases using "nosodes" -- homeopathic remedies made from "pathological disease tissue". They are taken orally in diluted form.

She claimed nosodes were regulated in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In fact, the FDA can and does take action against specific homeopathic manufacturers for putting patients at risk, but it does not approve homeopathic products.

The Guardian put it to Birch that the anti-vaccination message of homeoprophylaxis and Cease was contributing to a public health crisis manifested by the spread of measles. She said her work was dedicated to the "betterment of public health by strengthening children's immune system to infectious disease".

She added that in her opinion exposing children to infectious disease by leaving them unvaccinated was a good thing. "We need infectious disease," she said. "The best immunity to childhood infectious disease is through natural exposure and then you have lifelong immunity".

The last time that the American public relied on "natural exposure" to measles -- that is, before the US measles vaccination program began in 1963 -- the disease caused untold human suffering. Up to 4 million Americans contracted it each year, of whom almost 50 000 were hospitalized and 500 died annually.

The Guardian asked the FDA to state its current position on both Cease and homeoprophylaxis. The agency did not comment on the 2 programs specifically, but said in a statement that the "FDA has warned about the use of products labeled as homeopathic because of concerns that they have not been shown to offer clinical benefits in treating serious and/or life-threatening medical conditions, and that they also may cause serious harm."

The FDA added: "It deeply concerns us when we see preventable diseases such as measles -- a life-threatening infection we thought we had eliminated in the US in 2000 -- now making a tragic comeback and threatening our communities, despite having a vaccine available that is safe and highly effective. A factor contributing to the measles outbreak is inaccurate and misleading information about vaccines rather than the reliance on accurate, scientific-based information."

[Recommended reading!!! This is a serious problem that is being highly publicized as an alternative medical preventative. A history lesson is in order. - Mod.LK]

[It's bad enough the antivaxxers are putting children directly and indirectly in harm's way by creating pockets of susceptibles that permit circulation of the measles virus in a community and in addition to endangering those unvaccinated children, they are endangering those children who could not be vaccinated for medical reasons. Now they are selling snake oil treatments for autism and "immune boosting" to protect against diseases such as measles. As my colleague Mod.LK says, a history lesson is in order -- how many children were hospitalized and how many died due to measles before there was an effective vaccine. Millions of dollars have been spent looking at the theory of autism and its relationship to vaccinations, and no association has been found through the years since the fateful false study of Wakefield was published in Lancet. - Mod.MPP]

The Sullivan County Public Health Department reported 3 new cases of measles Tue [4 Jun 2019] and warns of 3 places in Kiamesha Lake and Fallsburg where others may have been exposed to it.

Since March [2019], Sullivan County now has 5 confirmed measles cases, as well as 2 suspect cases.

Two people confirmed to be contagious are under quarantine per a mandatory isolation order issued by Sullivan County Public Health Director Nancy McGraw, according to a news release from the county.

[See URL for locations and times of possible exposure.]

Sullivan County has been preparing for measles for a few months in anticipation of the annual summer migration of downstate residents and visitors that triples its population, as well as a massive outbreak of the disease in New York City and Rockland County. As of this week, there are 566 confirmed cases in the city and 255 in Rockland County, largely among unvaccinated children in the orthodox Jewish community.

Last week, the county legislature adopted a public health order that mandates summer camps require their campers and staff to be vaccinated against the measles.

https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/clarkstown/news/as-measles-cases-climb-rockland-summer-campers-required-to-be-vaccinated/769631/


As the number of measles cases climbs again in Rockland County to 256 confirmed cases, health department officials are offering additional free vaccine clinics and notifying parents that all children attending summer camp will be required to be vaccinated.

According to Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, all children attending summer camp and all camp staff must have been vaccinated for the measles in order to work or attend any Rockland County camp. The orders include day camps, traveling summer day camps, and children's overnight camps.

"For all the families who have already had their children vaccinated, this should be as simple as getting a document from your doctor," said County Executive Ed Day.

To help make it a fun summer for all and keep everyone safe, the department is offering a host of free MMR vaccine clinics.

Gritman Medical Center in Moscow treated a patient infected with measles Fri 31 May [2019], according to a statement on Gritman Medical Center's website. This is the 1st confirmed case in Idaho since 2001, according to a press release from Public Health - Idaho North Central District (PH-INCD) sent Wed 5 Jun [2019].

Clinical staff at Gritman quickly recognized measles symptoms and isolated the infected individual in a negative pressure containment room to reduce risk of measles spreading, according to the hospital's statement. After contacting the public health department, the patient left Gritman and staff cleaned all areas the individual passed through.

Public Health, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, and Gritman Medical Center are collaborating in response to the case, according to Public Health's release. The hospital and Public Health identified people who could have been exposed to the virus, according to the statement.

Washington's measles outbreak in February and March [2019] was mostly confined to Clark County and a later outbreak in 3 Puget Sound counties began 9 May [2019], likely due to exposure at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to the Washington State Department of Health website. Fifty-two of the 81 cases reported in Washington affected people aged one to 10, according to the Washington DOH, and 63 of the 81 confirmed infected individuals had received zero doses of the measles vaccination.

https://www.wcvb.com/article/religious-exemption-targeted-amid-measles-outbreaks/27702719


A week after this year's [2019] 2nd case of measles in Massachusetts was diagnosed, a state lawmaker from Haverhill filed a bill that would remove the religious exemption for vaccinating schoolchildren.

State law requires children who are entering school to be immunized against diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles and poliomyelitis, unless a physician certifies that a vaccine would endanger the child's health or unless the parent or guardian offers a written statement that vaccination or immunization conflicts with their "sincere religious beliefs."

A bill (HD 4284) Rep. Andy Vargas filed on Friday [31 May 2019] would strike the language about religious belief, allowing only medical exemptions. "As a Catholic myself, I fully respect everyone's right to practice their religious beliefs, but nobody has the right to infect another person's child," Vargas said in a statement. "We must keep in mind the common good. We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable members of our society."

Amid large outbreaks of measles both nationally and internationally, the Department of Public Health confirmed late last month [May 2019] that a child in greater Boston had been diagnosed with measles on 24 May [2019]. Public Health Commissioner Dr. Monica Bharel attributed spread of the disease to lack of vaccination, combined with domestic and international travel.

Another person in the greater Boston area had been diagnosed with measles on 31 Mar 2019.

A total of 981 individual measles cases have been confirmed in 26 states this year [2019] through 31 May, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's the highest number of cases reported in the USA since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000, according to the CDC. Last year [2018], a total of 372 measles cases were reported nationwide.

Maine Gov. Janet Mills on 24 May 2019 signed a law ending religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccination in her state.

California, West Virginia and Mississippi do not allow students to be exempted from vaccines for non-medical reasons, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Forty-six states, including Massachusetts, allow religious exemptions, and 15 allow philosophical exemptions for personal or moral beliefs.

Last month [May 2019], the Massachusetts Medical Society's House of Delegates adopted a resolution making it the society's policy to oppose non-medical vaccine exemptions for school entrance.

In the midst of a 27-year high for measles cases in the USA, health officials in northern Virginia are warning people that that they may have been exposed to a person with measles. The individual visited multiple locations this past weekend.

[See source URL for dates, times and places of possible exposure, according to the Virginia Department of Health.]

From 1 Jan through 31 May 2019, 981 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 26 states. This is an increase of 41 cases from the previous week. This is the greatest number of cases reported in the USA since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.

[Case count is preliminary and subject to change. Data are updated every Monday (charts and data courtesy of the CDC; see source URL).]

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, recently told WTOP that health officials find the lack of vaccinations "disturbing." And those who are most vulnerable are babies too young to get vaccinated. "That's the problem.... You generally get children vaccinated between 12 and 15 months for the 1st shot, and then the 2nd shot at 4 to 6 years," Fauci told WTOP.

"When you are in a very vulnerable area -- either traveling internationally or living in one of the outbreak areas -- you can vaccinate the child as early as 6 months to 11 to 12 months. But you only do that if you're in an area where there is an outbreak."

Before that, though, children remain at risk.

"That's why it's so disturbing to us in public health, where we see" less importance put on vaccines, Fauci said. "Which is really gauged not only to protect the individuals, but also to protect the vulnerables, like the children who cannot yet get vaccinated because of their age."

Adults can also simply go and get a vaccine, even if you've been vaccinated before.

"In general, you try to figure out if you were vaccinated with the full component. If you have not and you're concerned about it, there's no harm in getting another shot," Fauci said.

The worst year for measles in modern US history was 1958, with more than 763 000 reported cases and 552 deaths. The numbers fell dramatically after a vaccine became available in the 1960s, and by the 1983, the annual case count dipped below 1500.

But the illness rebounded at the end of the 1980s, with many cases among young unvaccinated black and Hispanic children living in inner-city areas. In 1990, more than 27 000 cases were reported, including about 90 deaths.

During the resurgence, public health officials began recommending children get 2 vaccine doses, instead of one. Cases began to drop, and they plummeted after the 1993 creation of a federal program providing vaccines to children whose parents or guardians can't afford them.

Will this year's measles cases reach the levels seen in the early 1990s? There are several reasons the answer may be no.

Overall, vaccination levels are higher nationally today. Also, measles cases historically peak in the spring for some unknown reason. Maybe that pattern will hold this year, too. But experts have been surprised by the current epidemic, and say some recent developments make it hard to predict. Some point to a social media-driven anti-vaccine movement that has been a major factor in the Brooklyn outbreak.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/canada-vaccine-registry-1.5158270


Creating a central place for people to look up their records is just one part of a long list of reasons why public health advocates have spent more than 2 decades calling for a national immunization registry. Those calls have been renewed recently with an outbreak of measles in Saint John.

One of those patients had visited a hospital in Halifax for treatment of something unrelated to measles. Because of that, all cleaners, doctors and nurses had to be tested to see if they were immune before they could return to work.

"I think the big advantage for a national registry is that allows us to see how well we're doing at reaching unimmunized populations and bringing their immunizations up to date. And that gives us a sense as to how protected we are against some of the most serious vaccine preventable diseases."

While Watson-Creed said the desire is there, a national registry would force public health officials to sort through some significant hurdles. Each jurisdiction follows its own system when it comes to vaccines. There are different types of shots, some are given on different schedules. "It would require 13 provinces to have the same approach."

There are, however, hints that it's possible. Eight provinces and territories have opted to use the same program, Panorama, to digitally track their public health records. Ultimately, it would also require the federal government's involvement to oversee the program.

Another death from measles was registered in Rivne city, western Ukraine. A 3-month-old child died from the complications caused by this disease, Rivne Regional Lab Center reported.

It is reported that a girl was born by a woman who was infected with measles during the pregnancy. A child was born premature and had congenital measles. The virus struck the brain and lungs of the child. All necessary resuscitation events took place; however, it was impossible to save a child.

The diagnosis of measles was confirmed at the virological labs.

It is noted that 74 citizens of Rivne region, including 60 children, were infected with measles last week. A total of 25 ill people, including 14 children, were hospitalized.

As we reported 50 749 people, including 24 905 adults and 26 844 children, have been sickened with measles in Ukraine in 2019. Earlier, the UN reported that 70% of all measles cases in Europe are observed in Ukraine.

Besides, all adults will get the vaccines against measles for free. Acting Healthcare Minister Ulyana Suprun reported that another 780 000 vaccines against measles will be bought by Ukraine in 2019.

Measles is on the increase in London with infections in the 1st quarter of 2019 outstripping the same period last year [2018] by more than a third. According to data from Public Health England (PHE), 149 measles infections were confirmed in London between January and March this year [2019]. Almost half of the infections were found in one northeast London borough alone, with 70 laboratory-confirmed infections found in Hackney.

By comparison, London recorded 107 cases in the 1st quarter of 2018.

Low vaccine uptake is thought to be responsible for the spread of the disease. Parents are now being urged to make sure children are vaccinated against the disease, which can cause serious health complications, including vision problems, hepatitis, meningitis and encephalitis.

London reports one of the lowest rates of uptake of the jab, and roughly two-thirds of confirmed measles cases in London were in children under 15.

According to PHE, 4 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in east and north London had the highest number of cases in the 1st quarter of the year: City and Hackney, Brent, Camden and Tower Hamlets.

The CCGs are working with GPs, NHS England and PHE to promote vaccine uptake. A spokeswoman from Tower Hamlets Borough Council, which is leading on immunisation work in the area, said there was not currently an outbreak in the borough.

Cases in City and Hackney CCG have been associated with the area's Charedi Orthodox Jewish community. Vaccine uptake has been "consistently lower than the rest of the borough and the rest of England," according to PHE's measles elimination plan published in January [2019].

The community has endured 5 or 10 times higher rates of infection than the rest of Hackney, the plan said. This year [2019] appears to have followed the same pattern, though the CCG said the infections recorded in the community have significantly declined through May.

The CCG has recorded 204 likely infections from January to March this year [2019] with around a third confirmed following lab testing. Four cases have been hospitalised, according to Homerton University Hospital Foundation Trust.

PHE's health protection team has "been working closely with City and Hackney CCG, GP practices, schools, nurseries and children's centres to raise awareness," the CCG told HSJ in a statement.

"The CCG also funded extra clinics across the borough and we have seen an improvement in uptake from the extra clinics and thanks to the efforts of staff within GP practices," the CCG said.

Northwest London is also experiencing a measles outbreak. According to preliminary reports to London's health protection team, 31 cases have been reported in April and May [2019], double the number reported in the first 3 months of the year.

West London GPs are urging patients to phone ahead if they suspect they or their child have measles, so they do not risk exposing susceptible patients to the virus.

The city's highly mobile and dense population, with people moving between boroughs as well as flying in and out from other countries, means infections such as measles "are imported more frequently [and] can be spread more quickly," according to Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at Public Health England.

"A third of children will have moved house at least once by the time they are one year old," he said. "As children move, there has been a tendency not to register promptly with a new GP, so invitations to appointments for pre-school boosters will not go to the correct address and children may miss out."

In contrast to London, England as a whole has reported fewer cases of measles so far in 2019. Last year [2018], England recorded its largest measles outbreak since 2012, with 966 infections.

This year [2019], there have been 231 laboratory-confirmed measles infections across England in the 1st quarter of the year -- fewer than the 265 recorded last year [2018].

This year's hospitalisation rate is also lower than in 2018, with one in 5 patients in hospital compared with more than 30% the year before.

In addition to London, PHE also identified the northwest and the east of England as areas associated with outbreaks of the disease.

Vaccine coverage across England is below the 95% target. Nearly 70% of this year's [2019] measles cases are in children aged under 15.

Passengers on an international flight to Sydney Airport [NSW, Australia] and a train to Sydney's south-west have been warned to look out for measles symptoms. A man in his 40s travelled on a Cathay Pacific flight to Sydney from Bangladesh

[See source URL for details on flight and train.]

It can take up to 18 days for symptoms to appear following exposure to a person with measles.

This alert brings the total number of measles cases in NSW to 36, including 8 children under the age of 5.

NSW Health director of communicable diseases, Dr. Vicky Sheppeard, said none of the locations visited by the man pose an ongoing risk.

It is not known if the man was fully vaccinated against measles.

More than 95% of 5-year-olds in NSW are vaccinated against measles.

A little boy who attended a Whangarei childcare centre has been cleared of having measles after it was reported his was the region's 5th case.

However, 2 new cases have since been confirmed elsewhere in the community, meaning the region does have a 5th and now 6th case.

When the alarm over the suspected child's case was raised last week, the Three Little Birds childcare centre in Tikipunga went into voluntary shutdown.

Staff and children who did not have full immunisation were asked to remain in isolation for 14 days to prevent any chance of passing on or contracting the highly infectious disease.

But the Northland District Health Board (NDHB) yesterday [4 Jun 2019] confirmed the initial results from tests carried out at a laboratory in Auckland had returned a "false positive." Further testing over the weekend proved the child did not have measles.

"We were delighted to be able to inform the daycare centre staff and attendees over the weekend that they were no longer required to be in isolation," Dr. Simon Baker, locum Medical Officer of Health, said.

The daycare centre had adhered to the isolation protocol until the test results were finalised, he said.

Three Little Birds' operations manager, Elysa Schuster, said the experience had been stressful for everyone, including the unwell child and his family, but had shown the centre's action plans were sound.

"The reason we had to close was because we could not confirm if we had enough immunised staff to stay open," Schuster said. "We now have the information that everyone has been immunised."
