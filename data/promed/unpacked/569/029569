The deadly disease infectious salmon anemia (ISA) may have
spread to another part of Scotland with a fish farm in the Loch
Broom area of Wester Ross suspected of harbouring the virus.
The Scottish Office confirmed a Statutory Notice has been issued
imposing movement restrictions on all the fish and farm equipment.
As a precaution, similar restrictions have been placed on 7 other
farms in the area .
The disease, which poses no threat to human health, is now
suspected in 18 fish farms in the Highlands and Islands, with 11
sites cleared of fish. It had previously hit operations in Lochaber,
Skye and Shetland and cost hundreds of jobs.
ISA has previously been identified in Norway and Canada, but this
is the first outbreak in the European community. It is a List 1
disease under the EC (European Commission) Fish Health regime
which requires eradication when an outbreak is confirmed.
A Scottish Office spokesman said an investigation has been
launched into the latest outbreak. The disease is seen as the
greatest threat to the UKL275 million industry.
A UKL9 million financial package, to be matched by the industry,
has been offered to salmon farmers directly affected by ISA.
