Hemorrhagic fever has caused the deaths of 5 people in Bolivia so far this year [2012], stated the Director of Epidemiology, Wilfredo Camargo.

According to the physician, Machupo virus causes this disease and is transmitted by the mouse _Calomys callosus_ [large vesper mouse], which is abundant in Mamore and Itenez provinces of the Bolivian department [state equivalent] of Beni.

To date, 98 suspected hemorrhagic fever cases are under investigation, of which 9 were confirmed by laboratory tests, stated Camargo. According to him, another 4 people are currently interned in the hospital, suspected of having contracted this disease.

The health authorities in Beni developed a contingency plan to avoid an increase in the cases in these provinces.

The Director of the departmental Health Services, Cesar Lijeron, said that the departmental government will disburse funds for the purchase of poison, traps, and other materials needed in the task of hygiene [rodent control] in the area.

[As of 21 Apr 2012, 3 people in Beni died of hemorrhagic fever and there were 50 suspected cases. Now the number of confirmed deaths is 9 and the number of suspected cases is essentially double. This appears to be a continuation of the outbreak in Beni department that began at the end of November last year (2011) (see ProMED-mail archive nos. 20111202.3514 and 20120129.1025260).

Symptoms and epidemiology of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are presented in ProMED-mail archive no. 20000416.0545. The large vesper mouse can be persistently infected with Machupo virus, a situation common among arenaviruses and their rodent hosts.
