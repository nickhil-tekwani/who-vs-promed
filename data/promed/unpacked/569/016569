1st report of an Rsv resistance-breaking isolate of Soybean mosaic
virus in Korea

Soybean mosaic virus (SMV), a member of the genus Potyvirus, is the
most prevalent pathogen of soybean (_Glycine max_) in Korea. Since a
single dominant gene, Rsv1 and its alleles, were identified in
resistant soybean lines or cultivars (Chen et al., 2002), additional
resistance genes Rsv3 and Rsv4 for SMV have been characterised
(Gunduz et al., 2002). In Korea, SMV-G5H in the 1980's (Cho & Chung,
1986) and SMV-G7H in the 1990's (Kim et al., 2003) were regarded as
dominant resistance-breaking (RB) strains on soybean cultivars
carrying Rsv1 alleles alone.
SMV isolate SMV-CN18 was collected from naturally-infected soybean,
cv. Taeankong, at Chungnam Agricultural Research & Extension
Services, Daejeon, Korea in 2000. It was identified serologically by
positive reaction to SMV-G1 antiserum (ATCC PVAS-94) in an agarose
gel double diffusion test, subjected to successive isolations from
single lesions on bean (_Phaseolus vulgaris_) cv. Topcrop and
maintained in soybean Lee 68 by mechanical inoculation.
To determine the biological traits of the isolate, differential
soybean cultivars and lines, Lee68 (rsv), PI96983 (Rsv1), York
(Rsv1-y), Marshall (Rsv1-m), Kwanggyo (Rsv1-k), Ogden (Rsv1-t),
Suweon97 (Rsv1-h), L29 (Rsv3) and V94-5152 (Rsv4), were mechanically
inoculated with the isolate and symptom development was observed for
2-3 weeks in a temperature-controlled greenhouse.
All soybean plants developed systemic mild mosaic symptoms on the
upper uninoculated leaves, without causing local necrotic lesions on
the lower leaves. To verify the systemic infection, upper leaves were
collected from each cultivar, tested for the presence of virus by
RT-PCR analysis and the positive results were confirmed.
The gene-specific primers to amplify coding regions of SMV-CN18 were
designed based on the conserved nucleotide sequences of SMV-G2, -G7
and -N. The optimal conditions for RT-PCR consistently yielded
amplified products of P1 (927 bp), HC-Pro (1371 bp), P3 (1197 bp), CI
(1902 bp including 6K), NIa (1298 bp including VPg), NIb (1551 bp)
and CP (795 bp) (Fig. 2).
The amplified DNA fragments encoding SMV genes were introduced into
pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, USA), their nucleotide sequences were
determined in both directions. In addition, the 5' and 3' non-coding
regions were determined by 5'- and 3'-RACE kit (Takara, Japan). The
complete sequence was submitted to the EMBL database under accession
number AJ619757.
The identities of nucleotide sequences for the full length genome of
SMV-CN18 were between 93 and 94 percent with known SMV strains (G2,
G5K, G7, G7d, G7H, Aa, Huanghuai 5 (HH5), Severe (HZ), N, and
Aa15-M2), and the identities of amino acid sequences for the coding
regions were between 95 and 96 percent, confirming that CN18 is a
strain of SMV.
This is the 1st report on the emergence of a SMV RB isolate
overcoming the resistance genes, Rsv1, Rsv3 and Rsv4 in the soybean
cultivars and lines.

[The emergence of resistance-breaking strains of SMV is a blow to
plant breeders and pathologists. SMV is one of the most widespread
viruses in soybean, and new resistance-breaking strains continue to
emerge. An example is the cultivar Hutcheson, developed in Virginia,
that is resistant to the common strains of SMV, but new
resistance-breaking (RB) isolates of SMV have emerged in natural
infections to break the resistance of Hutcheson containing the Rsv1
allele. Resistance to SMV is controlled by single dominant genes at 3
distinct loci, Rsv1, Rsv3, and Rsv4. The Rsv3 gene induces extreme
resistance, hypersensitive response, or restriction to virus
replication and movement, which are strain-specific. The Rsv4 gene
functions in a non-strain specific and non-necrotic manner,
restricting both cell-to-cell and long-distance movement of SMV. The
Rsv1, Rsv3, and Rsv4 resistance genes exhibit a continuum of
SMV-soybean interactions that include complete susceptibility, local
and syst!
emic necrosis, restriction of virus movement (both cell-to-cell and
long distance), reduction in virus accumulation, and extreme
resistance with no detectable virus. Cultivars containing 2 genes for
resistance (Rsv1 and Rsv3 or Rsv1 and Rsv4) were resistant to
multiple strains of SMV tested and show great potential for gene
pyramiding efforts to ensure a wider and more durable resistance to
SMV in soybeans.
