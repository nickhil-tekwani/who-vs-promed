As Liberia continues its fight against Ebola, another highly infectious disease is threatening young children. Pertussis disease, also known as whooping cough, has already infected more than 500 children in Maryland County in southern Liberia. The International Rescue Committee is supporting the local government in fighting what it calls an alarming outbreak of cases.

"Pertussis is an example of a terrible disease that's preventable if children and babies are vaccinated," said Nick Lobel-Weiss, an IRC health coordinator in Maryland County. "We're working rapidly to get the message out to communities that parents need to get their kids to health facilities for treatment now. The people of Liberia have suffered enough. They don't need this."

The IRC is already working closely with the county health team in the hardest hit areas of Maryland County, training and deploying teams of local volunteers to find children infected with whooping cough, assist parents in seeking treatment, and supporting campaigns to prevent further spread.

[The scope of this outbreak is not clear. Most pertussis-associated deaths are in quite young, unimmunized children who are in contact with older children or young adults with milder illness. Pertussis mortality can be minimized not only by immunization with trivalent vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, but also by early antimicrobial intervention. Large populations of susceptible people in the developing world are the cause of large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. - Mod.LL
