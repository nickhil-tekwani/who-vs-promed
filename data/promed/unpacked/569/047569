DRC: At least 34 die in new cholera outbreak
--------------------------------------------
At least 34 people have died from cholera in areas along Lake Kivu in the
east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a senior health official in the
affected province said on Thu, 27 Jan 2005. Another 2152 people have been
infected in the cholera outbreak, which began in early Jan 2005, Dr
Guyslain Bisimwa, medical inspector for South Kivu Province, told IRIN.
"The epidemic continues to advance although we are still waiting for
statistics," he said, adding that the Fizi area was the worst affected,
with 19 deaths so far.
South Kivu's deputy governor, Didas Kaningini Kyoto, who described the
outbreak as "serious and spreading," said the affected areas included the
localities of Mwenga -- where 12 deaths had been reported -- Uvira, Kabare,
Nyangezi, Katudu, Kamituga and the provincial capital, Bukavu.
Health and humanitarian agencies have been helping the affected population,
Jean-Marc Cordaro, who heads the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs in Bukavu, said. Hospitals have been providing free
medical care, while the public was being informed on measures to curtail or
prevent infection.
Cordaro said the fact that the supply of potable water in Bukavu had been
interrupted for 3 days last week, and that sewage had mixed with the water
supply, had contributed to the spread of the disease. "Cholera is endemic
to the region, but this time around we are facing one of the deadliest
outbreaks," he said.
Deputy Governor Kyoto said heavy rains in the province from 2 to 4 Jan 2005
had swept the town's garbage into Lake Kivu, which residents use for
drinking as well as washing. The rains, he said, had also destroyed at
least 800 homes in Uvira.

8 people have died and more than 48 others are admitted to various
hospitals following an outbreak of cholera in Funyula and Matayos divisions
of Busia District. 5 of the victims died at home, while 3 others perished
on arrival at hospital.
Western Provincial Medical Officer, Dr Olang'o Onudi, said more than 45
people had been treated at Matayos and Namboboto health centers, Nangina
Mission Hospital and Busia District Hospital.
Among the dead were an 80-year-old man, a 26-year-old woman and a
2-year-old girl who died at their homes. Dr Onudi said investigations
point to the use of the water from River Sio and other springs in the area
by residents after the Bumala-Funyula water project management cut off
supply to homes over unpaid bills 2 weeks ago.
He said investigations had established that the water source is heavily
contaminated with bacteria.

Disease hits flood victims in Sumatra
------------------------------------
Thousands of refugees in flood-hit areas in Sumatra are contracting serious
diseases because of inadequate shelter and a lack of clean water, officials
say.
In Lampung, more than 1500 people were treated by doctors during the
weekend with about 6500 recorded to be suffering from a series of ailments
ranging from skin rashes to dysentery and cholera.
In Ryacudu Hospital in North Lampung, at least 40 children have been
treated during the past few days for dysentery and cholera. Children were
most at risk from these life-threatening illnesses, while adults more often
contracted skin and respiratory infections, health workers said.
Officials were concerned the number of ill could rise, because clean water
being distributed by provincial and regental governments had still not
reached all the affected areas on Sun, 23 Jan 2005.
The recent flooding in Lampung, which began about 10 days ago, is more
severe than similar floods in 2002. It has affected every region except the
Metro municipality and Tanggamus regencies, which have better irrigation
and sewage systems. As of Sun 23 Jan 2005, the trans-Sumatra highway
connecting Lampung and Medan remained closed, with water cutting off the
Way Tulangbawang bridge.
Water levels in several places in Tulangbawang regency had gone down to 30
centimeters as of 23 Jan, from 1 to 2 meters a few days ago.
In South Sumatra, a government official estimated that hundreds of people
in the province were also sick from flood-related illnesses. 5 regencies in
the province have been affected, including Ogan Komering Ilir, Ogan Ilir
and Musi Banyuasin.

Dysentery outbreak kills 12 in Flores
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of dysentery has killed at least 12 people and affected
hundreds of others in eastern Flores, an official said. East Flores health
agency head Eduard Kleruk said dysentery had affected 6 subdistricts in the
regency, with East Adonara the worst-hit.
"In East Adonara alone, 11 people died from the disease and more than 100
are still being given serious treatment," he said. Many of the victims were
babies and the elderly. Kleruk blamed poor domestic sanitation for the
outbreak.
