A two-year-old boy who died this month was killed by a strain of
enterovirus 71 similar to one thought to have claimed at least 80 lives in
Taiwan and Malaysia, officials said yesterday. The Department of Health
confirmed that both the boy and his three-year-old sister [who recovered
completely] had EV71 infections, although its source remained a mystery.
Gene sequencing tests showed the strain of EV71 isolated from the boy was a
"relative" of that found in Malaysia in 1997 and Taiwan last year.
However, Dr Mak Kwok-hang, the department's consultant in community
medicine, said the public should not be alarmed. He said the strain was
only similar to "one of the many" discovered in Taiwan and Malaysia. It was
different to the strain found in Hong Kong last year. "There is no
evidence to show that the gene sequence of enterovirus is directly linked
to its toxicity [virulence]," he said.
More than 30 children in Malaysia and 50 in Taiwan died after suffering
hand-foot-mouth disease, one of the manifestations of EV71. However, health
authorities are still unable to prove the epidemic was caused by EV71.
It was the first fatal case reported in the territory since the
surveillance system on hand-foot-mouth disease was set up last June. The
Hospital Authority's taskforce on enterovirus infection met yesterday and
agreed to improve surveillance of hand-foot-mouth disease in public
hospitals.

[This message included much of the above report and further suggests that
nucleotide sequencing analyses indicate that the EV-71 virus strain is very
similar to but slightly different from isolates from Malaysia and Taiwan
analyzed last year. This is not surprising. - Mod.CHC]
This brings the total number of EV-71 cases in Hong Kong this year to six
cases. One patient (mentioned above) had died and all others made full
recovery. In 1998, there were 60 confirmed cases of EV71 infections, five
of whom had neurological complications but there was no fatality.
