A new virus that has killed more than 100 people in Malaysia has claimed
the life of one more victim on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, a news report
said today.
The latest victim was a worker at a slaughterhouse in the central state of
Selangor, The Sun newspaper reported. The man, who had been hospitalized
since July 27 after being infected with the deadly Nipah virus, died on
Friday.
The virus, which is transmitted from pigs to humans, swept through more
than half of Malaysia's thirteen states earlier this year.
It first surfaced in Negri Sembilan state, 60 miles southeast of Kuala
Lumpur, where it killed 84 people and sickened hundreds. To prevent its
spread, the government ordered the destruction of about 1 million pigs.
The latest death troubled health officials.
"We are curious how he could be infected, since his official work was to
mark carcasses,'' Veterinary Services Department director general Dr.
Mohamad Nordin Mohamad Nor was quoted as saying by newspaper.
"The risk of infection for those at the end of the slaughter process is
low, compared with those who handle live pigs," he said.
Health officials warn that there are still pigs across Malaysia that are
infected by the deadly virus. Malaysia has been conducting random tests on
pigs nationwide and any hog farm found with even one infected pig must
destroy its entire stock.
The viral outbreak was initially attributed to Japanese encephalitis, which
is transmitted from pigs to humans by the culex mosquito. Later, scientists
identified a new virus, named Nipah after the Malaysian village where it
claimed its first victim.
The nine-month outbreak has ruined the pig-farming industry in many parts
of Malaysia.

[With a virus as widespread around the country as this one, there are bound
to be cases where a virus-positive pig farm is missed and an infected
animal reaches the slaughterhouse. We are, of course, assuming that this
case has been confirmed by laboratory tests. Now the important thing is to
identify the points of risk in the carcass-marking process. It would also
be interesting to know if the fatal case was immunodeficient, making him
susceptible to a very low infective dose of the virus. - Mod.JW
