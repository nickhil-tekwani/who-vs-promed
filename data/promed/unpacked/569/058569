Over the years, bird flu has been hitting different areas worldwide. According to RFI [Radio France Internationale], the contagious avian influenza virus has hit a poultry set in Peru, specifically a Huacho-based [Huaura province, Lima region] farm located in the north of Lima.

Because of the confirmed case, over 37 000 birds have been killed to prevent the further spread of the illness. Jorge Mantilla, head of disease control in the national agricultural health agency SENASA, mentioned.

Managing avian flu outbreaks
To control the spread of these outbreaks, slaughtering infected birds is part of the protocol. This is done so further spread of the disease to other birds can be prevented. Avian flu is severely lethal for birds. Hence, authorities need to prevent the illness from reaching other birds and places.

Bird flu casualties across Peru
In the past weeks, around 14 000 seabirds in Peru have succumbed to bird flu. Most of these birds were pelicans.

Phys [https://phys.org/news/2022-12-peru-slaughters-poultry-bird-flu.html] also reports there were around 700 birds killed to stop the virus from being transmitted to other birds. This took place across north Peru, specifically in Lambayeque city.

Because of this outbreak, the Peruvian Poultry Association notes consuming eggs and births is risky.

After a case of avian flu was first confirmed among poultry on the farm, Peru immediately implemented a national health emergency for 90 days.

Bird flu's roots and spread
RFI notes according to SENASA [National Agrarian Health Service of Peru], bird flu comes from wild and untamed birds from North America. These birds then arrive in Patagonia.

Avian flu had its 1st outbreak across the Americas last year [2021]. Just last January 2022, the virus was spotted in the United States. Its presence has then affected poultry production, according to Peru authorities.

The CDC [https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/avian-in-birds.htm] notes while bird flu naturally happens among wild aquatic poultry, domesticated birds can also get infected through direct exposure to other infected birds or waterfowl. This can cover contact with the infected bird's nasal secretions, saliva, or manure. Other birds can also get infected by direct exposure to contaminated surfaces.

Bird flu is greatly contagious and infectious among different kinds of birds. At times, the virus may make the bird sick or even let it succumb to an untimely death.

When outbreaks are noted in particular poultry sets, culling or depopulation of infected poultry is done. Other than that, authorities also check nearby poultry or birds connected to the infected group. They may also quarantine exposed flocks.

Nebraska agriculture officials say another 1.8 million chickens must be killed after bird flu was found on a farm in the latest sign the outbreak which has already prompted the slaughter of more than 50 million birds nationwide continues to spread.

The Nebraska Department of Agriculture said Saturday the state's 13th case of bird flu was found on an egg-laying farm in northeast Nebraska's Dixon County, about 120 miles (193 kilometers) north of Omaha, Nebraska.

Just like on other farms where bird flu has been found this year [2022], all the chickens on the Nebraska farm will be killed to limit the spread of the disease. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) says more than 52.3 million birds in 46 states -- mostly chickens and turkeys on commercial farms -- have been slaughtered as part of this year's outbreak.

Nebraska is 2nd only to Iowa's 15.5 million birds killed with 6.8 million birds now affected at 13 farms.

In most past bird flu outbreaks the virus largely died off during the summer, but this year's version found a way to linger and started to make a resurgence this fall with more than 6 million birds killed in September [2022].

The virus is primarily spread by wild birds as they migrate across the country. Wild birds can often carry the disease without showing signs. The virus spreads through droppings or the nasal discharge of an infected bird, which can contaminate dust and soil.

Commercial farms have taken a number of steps to prevent the virus from infecting their flocks, including requiring workers to change clothes before entering barns and sanitizing trucks as they enter the farm, but the disease can be difficult to control. Zoos have also taken precautions and closed some exhibits to protect their birds.

Officials say there is little risk to human health from the virus because human cases are extremely rare and the infected birds aren't allowed to enter the nation's food supply. Plus, any viruses will be killed by properly cooking poultry to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.

But the bird flu outbreak has contributed to the rising prices of chicken and turkey along with the soaring cost of feed and fuel.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) on Tuesday announced bird flu has been found at commercial turkey flocks in Cherokee County and Sac County.

A commercial turkey farm in Buena Vista County was found to have the virus four days earlier, according to the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza, a very contagious form of bird flu, has been circulating in the United States this year, resulting in the euthanizing of millions of birds, which in turn caused the prices of many egg and poultry products to rise. The disease is believed to be spread by wildfowl and is not thought to present a health risk to humans.

With the positive results in Cherokee and Sac counties, the virus has been found in 26 flocks of birds in the state of Iowa this year [2022]. Cherokee County and Sac County have each been hit with bird flu twice this year, while Buena Vista County has had fiv5e outbreaks. Commercial turkey farms have been especially hard-hit.

The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship recommends operators of commercial flocks and owners of backyard flocks do as much as possible to prevent their birds from coming into contact with wild birds. Birds that show signs of illness or an unusual uptick in deaths among birds should be immediately reported to state or federal officials, the department said in a press release.

ABC News reports bird flu has returned to the Midwest earlier than predicted following a lull of several months. On 31 Aug 2022 officials said the highly pathogenic disease had been detected in a commercial turkey flock in western Minnesota. Last weekend [3-4 Dec 2022], a farm in Meeker County reported a sudden increase in mortality. According to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health, tests confirmed the presence of the disease, and the flock was euthanized to prevent the spread. ABC News reports it was the 1st confirmed case of avian influenza in Minnesota since the end of May [2022]. Cases have been detected in Indiana, California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, and several eastern states.

While the timing of this detection is a bit sooner than we anticipated, we have been preparing for a resurgence of the avian influenza we dealt with this spring, Dr Shauna Voss, Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian, via ABC. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is here and biosecurity is the 1st line of defense to protect your birds, Dr. Shauna Voss, Minnesota Board of Animal Health senior veterinarian, via ABC.

According to the US Department of Agriculture, 414 flocks in 39 states, have been infected since February [2022]. As a result, over 40 million birds, mostly commercial turkeys and chickens, have been euthanized. So far in 2022, avian flu has struck 81 Minnesota flocks and required 2.7 million birds to be killed

How the avian influenza has impacted Iowa
One human and more than 37 million birds -- comprised mostly of poultry across 172 commercial flocks and 119 backyard flocks in 34 states -- have been affected in the current avian influenza outbreak.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced in April 2022 that a Colorado man was the 1st reported US citizen to have contracted the H5N1 virus during the current outbreak. The patient was an inmate at a state correctional facility whose pre-release employment program involved the depopulation, or killing, of poultry at a commercial farm in Montrose County. His only symptom was fatigue, and he has since made a complete recovery.

Stacker compiled statistics on the avian influenza in Iowa using data from the US Department of Agriculture. The data is current as of 9 May 2022. According to the USDA, the affected count captures the total number of birds on the premises where the H5N1 virus was detected. Although it is possible that not every bird was carrying the virus, all birds within an affected population are culled to prevent further spread.

Impact from state to state varies based largely on the number of commercial operations within each state. In Ohio, just one backyard flock and 20 birds were affected. In neighboring Pennsylvania, close to 4 million birds have been destroyed. Worse still, Iowa, which had the highest number of chickens of any US state in 2021 with 60 million heads, has been the most severely impacted in terms of quantity, losing a little more than 13 million birds since the virus was first reported in a commercial turkey flock in Indiana in February 2022.

The impact of the outbreak is being felt by many Americans at the grocery store. According to the USDA's Food Price Outlook for April 2022, poultry prices are predicted to increase between 7.5% and 8.5%, and egg prices are predicted to increase between 6% and 7% due, in part, to decreased production at some of the country's biggest commercial flocks.

- Number of birds affected in Iowa: 13.4 million
-- 1 most birds affected among all states
-- 35.6% of all birds affected nationwide

[4] Missouri (Osage county): commercial turkeys
Date: Mon 12 Dec 2022
Source: Farm Progress, Missouri Department of Agriculture (MDS) report [edited]
https://www.farmprogress.com/poultry/another-missouri-poultry-flock-infected-avian-flu


Federal officials have confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Osage County, Missouri USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed presence of HPAI in the turkey flock. Samples were delivered to NVSL in Ames, Iowa, for testing after a sudden increase in mortality in the flock.

Missouri saw 9 outbreaks of the disease last spring. And so far this fall 7 flocks have been found infected with the disease. HPAI is deadly in domesticated poultry.

Missouri Department of Agriculture [MDA] veterinary officials have quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property have been depopulated. The depopulated birds did not enter the food supply.

MDA Animal Health Division employees are working with federal partners on additional surveillance and testing in the areas around the affected flock.

All poultry producers are encouraged to tighten their biosecurity practices around the farm. Producers should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and report sick birds or an unusual increase in death loss to a local veterinarian or the state veterinarian's office at MDA.

Avian influenza does not present a food safety risk. Poultry and eggs are safe to eat. Always properly handle poultry products and cook those products to proper temperatures.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States.

Situation updates of ongoing avian influenza activities in Missouri, as well as important biosecurity and virus-related information, will be posted online at http://www.Agriculture.Mo.Gov/avian-influenza.

A commercial flock of 11 394 turkeys at a farm in Daviess County is the 15th flock in Indiana found to have bird flu, state officials said.

The birds tested presumptive positive for avian influenza on Sunday and have been quarantined, the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) said in a statement. Samples will be tested at Iowa's national U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory for confirmation. [National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa]

The flock is the 1st in Daviess County to test positive for bird flu so far this year [2022].

With Sunday's [11 Dec 2022] discovery, the state board will test birds in nearby flocks for the virus.

The bird flu confirmation is the 1st in Indiana since the start of September [2022], the state said in a news release. On 1 Sep 2022 more than 260 birds in a hobby flock in Elkhart County tested positive for the virus.

The 2022 bird flu outbreak is Indian's largest in years and is part of the country's worst outbreak since 2015. In the past year, Indiana farmers have lost more than 400 000 birds to the flu.

Avian flu is spread by the droppings of migrating waterfowl, which makes it hard for farms and state officials to control the spread.

Here's data on bird flu outbreaks so far this year [2022] in Indiana:
- Elkhart County in northern Indiana: a small flock of chickens, ducks, and geese tests positive. The birds were euthanized.
- DuBois and Greene counties in southern Indiana: 6 commercial turkey flocks. A total of 171 224 birds in the flocks were euthanized.
- Elkhart County in northern Indiana: 3 commercial duck flocks. A total of 17 179 birds in the flocks were euthanized.
- Johnson County: hobby flock of chickens, ducks, and peafowl. Remaining birds in the flock were euthanized.
- Allen County: 2 small flocks of an undisclosed type of bird. Remaining birds in the flock were euthanized.
- Allen County: about 50 chickens and ducks in a small, hobby operation in the Fort Wayne area. The birds were euthanized.

Updated numbers from the state show 171 733 commercial turkeys and 17 703 commercial ducks have been euthanized due to bird flu in 2022.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the risk to humans is low and the strains of bird flu currently circulating in North America have no history of causing human illness.

According to agriculture officials, the affected site is a commercial turkey flock. This marks the 1st confirmed case of bird flu in an Ida Countyflock this year [2022].

There have now been 30 flocks infected with bird flu in Iowa this year, with 11 of them during the fall season. Since last Friday [9 Dec 2022], a total of approximately 240-thousand turkeys have been infected between turkey farms in Ida, Buena Vista, Sac, and Cherokee Counties. Around 16-million turkeys and chickens have had to be slaughtered in Iowa this year to limit the spread of the disease.

Avian influenza is a highly contagious viral disease affecting bird populations. The disease can travel in wild birds without those birds appearing to be sick, but is often fatal to domestic bird populations.
