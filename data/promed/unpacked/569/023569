[It does appear as though MERS-CoV transmission is increasing this month [January 2020]. Since 1 Jan 2020, there have been 10 newly confirmed patients, including 3 in healthcare workers in Abha city, Asir region, all 3 of whom are classified as secondary cases, suggesting they had contact with a MERS-CoV-infected individual, most likely in the healthcare setting. That being said, the most recent MERS-CoV confirmation in Abha city prior to these 3 healthcare workers had date of confirmation of illness on 12 Dec 2019 and date of death on 24 Dec 2019, both dates outside of a 14-day incubation period. We've asked for more information in a prior post and are still requesting more information.

The other 7 cases have all been classified as primary cases and came from Riyadh region (4), Al Qasim (2), and Al Madinah (1) regions.
