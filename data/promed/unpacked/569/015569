The control measures described in the above report do not include stamping-out/modified stamping-out/slaughter, nor vaccination; this may lead to continuous circulation of the virus (endemic situation) with periodic exacerbations.

Comoros has submitted to the OIE semi-annual and annual reports for 4 years, namely 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011. According to those reports, PPR was absent during 2008 and 2009; 3 outbreaks, affecting goats, were reported during the 2nd half of 2010. The control measures reportedly applied in 2010 were limited to Qf (precautions at the border) and GSu (=General surveillance); the disease is reportable. According to Comoros annual report for 2011, the disease was present but no further details supplied; the control measures applied were similar to 2010, with Te (= screening) added. No periodic reports for 2012 are available yet.

Has the source of infection in 2012 not been a manifestation of an ongoing endemic situation? Clarifications will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
