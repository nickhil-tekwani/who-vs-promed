Russia Bans Spanish Meat Over Mad Cow Fears
---------------------------------------
MOSCOW: Russia has banned imports of cattle and some meat and meat products
from Spain due to fears of BSE, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Ministry
told Reuters on Wednesday. "The ban became effective from 7 Mar 2001, that is
from today," the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said that the ban would
apply to imports of pedigreed cattle, beef products, sheep and goat meat
and products, processed bovine, sheep and goat proteins and some other
products including gelatin.
Russia has already banned imports of live cattle from 3 German states,
France and the Netherlands and restricted beef imports from Portugal,
Switzerland, Ireland, France and Britain because of fears over BSE. No case
of BSE has been discovered in Russia so far.
