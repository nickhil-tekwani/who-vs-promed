Re: the health tests on milk in U.K. and the discussion on the efficiency
of pasteurization -- I would like to mention the paper of Ebringer et al.
(Environmental Health Perspectives 105, 1997, 1172-1174) where a paper of
Mielants H. et al.( Br. J. Rheumatol. 27, Suppl. 2, 1988, 95-105) is
cited.
I suppose that the hypothesis of autoimmune etiology of Crohn's disease due
to bacteria showing molecular mimicry with antigens in the gut has to be
taken into account. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ is cited in the above-mentioned
paper. Great numbers of relevant articles showing the relations in
immunological findings in patients with Crohn's disease and different
arthropathies can be found. Similar sequences could be present in different
bacteria, different strains of mycobacteria included. If this hypothesis
would be confirmed, _M. paratuberculosis_ would be important not only if
its ability to survive pasteurization would be proven. Huge numbers of
cells (even dead cells) in milk and milk products from infected herds would
be the main reason for anxiety.
If one of the etiological reasons for Crohn's/Johne's disease is any
sequence in bacteria together with sensitivity of the macroorganism, the
problem to be solved would not be in [the efficiency of pasteurization, or
in recommendations not to drink milk and to consume milk products, but in
the decrease or elimination of relevant microorganisms in the environment.
Eradication of Johne's disease in cattle, elimination of _M. xenopi_ from
water, etc. would be on the list of national budget items. Really
unpleasant, but not [an impossible development.
