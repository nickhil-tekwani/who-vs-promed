Russia: 4 Fatal Cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in the Southern
Federal District
---------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 25 Jul 2005, Rospotrebnadzor (the Federal Service for [Human
Rights] and Welfare) reported that 127 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever (CCHF) had been notified in the Southern Federal District (SFD) since
the beginning of the year. This number is 2.3 times more than during the
same period of 2004. According to Rospotrebnadzor, 110 patients have been
discharged on recovery (compared with 43 during the same period in 2004),
and 4 have died (compared with 6 in 2004). In all cases the diagnosis has
been confirmed by laboratory testing.

In detail, 38 cases of CCHF have been notified in Kalmykia (compared with
12 in 2004), 32 cases in Stavropol territory (compared with 28 in 2004), 36
cases in the Astrakhan region (compared with 3 in 2004), 14 in the Rostov

[The Southern Federal District (SFD) is one of 7 federal administrative
districts in Russia. It is located in the far southwest and includes the
Rostov, Krasnodar, Stavropol, Volgograd, and Astrakhan regions, and also
the Republics of Chechnya, Kalmykia, Dagestan, Adygeya, Severhaya Osetiya,
Kabardino-Balkaria, Ingushetiya, and Karachaevo-Cherkessiya. The Capital of
the Southern Federal District is Rostov-on-Don. - Corresp.NP]

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a severe tick-borne hemorrhagic fever
that occurs in rural communities throughout much of Africa, the
Middle-East, the Balkans, Russia, and northern China. The causative agent
is a tick-borne virus belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. The disease can be contracted directly from infected ticks
or from sheep and other susceptible domestic animals at time of slaughter.
Infected domestic animals rarely exhibit symptoms of infection. Nosocomial
transmission can occur in hospitals, particularly among those undergoing
surgery. No information is included in the above report regarding the
source of infection, but it is likely that the patients are mainly rural
workers infected directly by tick-bite. The increased number of human cases
in the first half of 2005 no doubts reflects a corresponding increase in
the abundance of ticks over a wide area of southern Russia. - Mod.CP]
