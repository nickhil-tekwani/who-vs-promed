A local artisan food shop is voluntarily recalling some of its products after an inspection by the Rhode Island Department of Health, but the company said it hasn't changed its production methods since it passed inspection in 2010.

The health department, on Fri 15 Dec 2012, advised consumers not to eat certain cheeses, meats and jarred vegetables produced by Farmstead Inc. and sold at a shop at 186 Wayland Ave., Providence, Rhode Island, and through <www.farmsteadinc.com>.

Health inspectors initiated an investigation after receiving a tip, the Health Department said, and no one has reported an illness associated with Farmstead foods. The recalled products, which include carrots, beets, eggplant, zucchini, pickles and tomato jam in 8- or 16-ounce jars and chicken liver mousse and pork rillettes in 4-ounce jars, all with a screw-on metal lid and without a production or date code, were produced without the required controls to prevent a toxin that causes botulism.

Also recalled are certain soft and semi-soft cheeses, raw milk cheeses, goat cheeses, and any cheeses that are labeled "Keep Refrigerated" that were sold at room temperature in the retail store.

D'Artagnan salami (labeled "Keep Refrigerated") and prosciutto, salamis, liverwurst, and other meats processed at the store are also being recalled because they were improperly processed, the health department said.

Consumers who have any of these recalled products at home should discard them or return them to the store, the health department said.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
