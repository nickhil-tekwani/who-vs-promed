An unknown disease causing bouts of severe fever has spread across several
districts of Hodeida [Al Hudaydah], 200 km west of the capital Sana'a, a
local doctor told the Yemen Times. "It's an epidemic which is now rampant,
especially in the rural areas of Hodeida," Dr Mohamed Abdul Rahman Al-Qadi,
a doctor in Al-Marawa' district of Hodeida told the Yemen Times.

He explained that the disease, aided by falling temperatures at night, is
seriously affecting Hodeida's rural areas, which are more exposed and
vulnerable to the cold. Adults, especially those over 30, are more
susceptible to contracting the disease.

A similar disease hit the same area last year [2009], but this year, its
prevalence has been much higher, hitting around 40 per cent of Hodeida's
population compared to the one per cent of those infected in 2009,
according to Al-Qadi.

No deaths have yet been reported, but the disease can cause paralysis. The
fever causes an acute inflammation of the joints as well as severe
headaches, the doctor told the Yemen Times. He added that those with
already weak immune systems are particularly vulnerable.

Locals from Hodeida are reportedly alarmed by the disease, which has yet to
be officially classified by doctors. However, officials from the Ministry
of Health in Hodeida have told the Yemen Times that it is only a normal
fever and that there is no need to panic.

"It is only a normal fever caused by the cold," said Dr Othman Al-Baidani,
director of the Ministry of Health Office in the governorate. "Not a single
death has been recorded yet." The director said that the Ministry of Health
has recently formed a medical team and sent them to some of the affected areas.

In addition, the Health Office in the governorate has formed an operation
team in all of Hodeida's districts to follow up on the strange epidemic,
according to Al-Baidani. Those suffering from the disease, which is known
amongst locals as Al-Kritis fever, do not recover until given a strong dose
of antibiotics and vitamin injections, Dr. Al-Qadi said.

But many of those living in the infected areas of Al-Marawa', Al-Jarahi,
Zabeed, Bait Al-Faqih, Al-Mansoorya and Hais are unable to afford the
medication which costs more than YR 2000 (USD 10). In addition to disease,
Hodeida, Yemen's poorest governorate, suffers from rampant levels of poverty.

More than half of Hodeida's 2.5 million people live in traditional houses
built from wood, mud bricks, and straw. Their main source of income is
derived from agriculture and livestock.

The director of the Health Office in Hodeida advised families to take care
of hygiene in their houses and to cover water pools and swamps.

Strange epidemic ravaging western Yemen
---------------------------------------
A number of cities villages and districts of the province of Hodeidah,
western Yemen have been hit by strange outbreaks, the causes and sources of
which are unknown.

The outbreaks have so far resulted in the deaths of 5 people and infected
thousands of others from different age groups. Local sources say that the
epidemic started about a month ago and has now spread to the "Zabid -- Beit
al-Faqih --Nectarine".

The outbreak has so far killed 5 people in the Nectarine city and infected
thousands of others, many of whom are in a coma. There is a state of panic
and terror among the citizens because of the rapid spread of infection,
which has prompted a large numbers of students to leave school, especially
after the discovery of infections among students and teachers.

It is believed that there are deaths and infected people in many other
villages in remote and distant districts, where the inhabitants lack most
of the basic services and health infrastructure.

The sources confirmed that the epidemic, which is known to the inhabitants
of those areas as "Almkrvs". The disease begins with a very high
temperature, without without treatments leading to a sustained coma. In
addition to flulike symptoms [cough, fever, and muscle and joint pains],
headache, swelling of the face and joints, and trembling of the body have
been reported. Bleeding from the mouth and nose, and skin rash "bleeding
under the skin", diarrhea and vomiting, and inability to stand or walk have
also been described.

The sources said that the results of medical examinations conducted in the
patients affected by the epidemic, were all infections in the blood. The
treatment has been limited to giving the patient a dose of "glucose" with
some vitamins and painkillers.

A large number of the local population are being infected by the epidemic,
which appeared to infect in all the houses of the affected areas where the
number of patients in each family is between 4 and 5 people. It is a
serious threat to all county residents, who numbered over 2.1 million
according to the 2004 Census.

A large proportion of the population are experiencing difficult and
miserarable living conditions making them more susceptible to infection. It
is believed to be caused by bacteria transmitted by the wind resulting from
the bodies of dead animals.

A number of local residents have condemmed and rejected what they called
the "ignorance" shown by the concerned authorities and local councils in
the province. Citizens are demanding that the government, led by the
Ministry of Health and local authorities in the province to assume their
responsibilities and hasten to send medical teams to the areas where the
epidemic has spread and undertake the examination of infected cases to
identify the causes of the disease.

In addition to the transfer of patients from villages and neighborhoods,
isolating them in special places outside the population centers and
providing treatment and other actions that would protect the population
against infection and limit the spread as they consider that the epidemic
is spread by the air and move with the wind.

The need is stressed to provide the necessary treatment for patients free
of charge as some families cannot pay the costs of treatment. Local press
sources confirmed by mid-August that a strange epidemic was killing
children in rural villages directorate "Alemrauap" Hodeidah province, which
has resulted in the deaths of five children and infecting dozens of cases
of diarrhea and vomiting.

The Office of Health, the Government and an anti-epidemiological
surveillance group in addition to a committee from the Ministry of Health
visited the region in an attempt to control the epidemic, but they did not
identify what the disease is. In late October, other press sources said
that the disease had alos been identified in the Directorate of "Beit al-
Faqih -- and the Nectarine.

[The two reports differ in both detail and tone, which makes it hard to
assess what the cause is likely to be. Both agree that many cases of
something have occurred. Deaths appear to have been absent or relatively
rare. The following commentaries are based on the first and second reports,
respectively. Authoritative information from the region would be
appreciated. - Mod.SH

From the limited description of symptoms, it is difficult to make a
precise diagnosis. This seems to be a recurrent non-lethal disease
associated with poverty and lack of basic resources. In recent years, there
have been extensive outbreaks of malaria, dengue haemorrhagic fever, and
influenza in Yemen, any of which might be responsible for the current
outbreak. - Mod.CP

The newspaper message translated above says that thousands have been
infected but only 5 people have died. A picture of a patient published in
the newspaper article showed ecchymosis, a sign of subcutaneous bleeding.

Given that it seems to be large outbreak in a limited geographical area
within a short time span (few months?), vectorborne zoonoses like Crimean
Congo haemorrhagic fever, hantavirus, or Rift Valley fever seem unlikely.
Dengue haemorrhagic fever is another possibility and a large number of less
severe cases in a situation with an introduction of a new serotype could
explain the outbreak. Meningococcal infection would cause a clinical
picture of septicemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, with
cutaneous bleeding, but a large community wide outbreak would be unusual
outside the meningitis belt in tropical Africa, and a higher case fatality
rate would be expected. Leptospira may cause DIC, but large outbreaks are
usually linked to exposure to surface water and a widespread outbreak like
this would have to be explained by contanmination of drinking water sources
in all of the affected areas.

Anthrax spread by airborne spores would probably more cause sporadic cases
and the zoonotic Alkhurma virus is rare and probably spread by direct
contact with infected animals, which cannot explain the large number of
cases including many children seen here. Â– Mod.EP
