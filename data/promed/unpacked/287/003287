A total of 4 people have died from food poisoning caused by the consumption of shark meat in the district of East Fenerive, Madagascar.

According to the local journal Midi, after the death of 2 men, a child and a woman who died of food poisoning after eating shark meat in the village of Ampasibe Manampatrana, Fenerive East [Analanjirofo Region], the death toll increased to 4 persons.

While most of the victims were able to return to their homes, others are still quite ill, said The News. After 4 days of intensive care, 10 patients have not yet awakened from coma, while 3 others are aware but are in a serious condition. Hospital sources say that "23 patients are still being followed day and night, with doctors closely monitoring their health."

According to The News, 4 of them have been transferred to the hospital in Toamasina [Atsinanana Region], as their cases required the use of more appropriate care materials.

Note that this food intoxication goes back to last Monday, 11 Nov 2013, after a local fisherman captured and sold, in the local market, a shark of a weight of 120 kg, suspected to be toxic and harmful to human health.

[For the most part, eating shark meat has been felt to be safe, but it can contain toxic levels of mercury. However, published reports from eastern Madagascar (essentially the same report published in French in 1994 and in English in 1995) documents a large cluster of foodborne illness from a bull shark (_Carcharhinus leucas_) with gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms and a case fatality rate of almost 30 percent.

From the English language report: Boisier P, Ranaivoson G, Rasolofonirina N, et al: Fatal mass poisoning in Madagascar following ingestion of a shark (Carcharhinus leucas): clinical and epidemiological aspects and isolation of toxins. Toxicon. 1995; 33:1359-1364.

Abstract:
"In November 1993, 188 people were admitted to hospital after eating the meat from a single shark (_Carcharhinus leucas_) in Manakara, a medium-sized town on the south-east coast of Madagascar. This shark and its meat had no unusual characteristics. The attack rate was about 100 percent. The 1st clinical signs appeared within 5-10 hours after ingestion. The patients presented with neurological symptoms almost exclusively, the most prominent being a constant, severe ataxia. Gastrointestinal troubles, like diarrhoea and vomiting, were rare. The overall case mortality ratio was close to 30 percent among the 200 poisoned inhabitants. There were no reports of previous similar poisonings in this area, and fishermen in Manakara usually eat this kind of shark without problems. Bacteriological and chemical causes were eliminated. Two liposoluble toxins were isolated from the liver and tentatively named carchatoxin-A and -B, respectively. They were distinct from ciguatoxin in their chromatographic properties."

The earlier French language report of the same outbreak is: Boisier P, Ranaivoson G, Rasolofonirina N, et al: [Fatal ichthyosarcotoxism after eating shark meat. Implications of two new marine toxins]. Arch Inst Pasteur Madagascar. 1994; 61:81-83.

Additionally, the flesh of a Greenland shark (_Somniosus microcephalus_) is poisonous (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_shark). This is due to the presence of the toxin trimethylamine oxide, which, upon digestion, breaks down into trimethylamine, producing effects similar to extreme drunkenness. Occasionally, sled dogs that end up eating the flesh are unable to stand up due to the neurotoxins. Similar toxic effects occur with the related Pacific sleeper shark, but not in most other shark species, whose meat is often consumed fresh. However, it can be eaten if it is boiled in several changes of water or dried or fermented for some months to produce kaestur hakarl, often called hakarl for short. Traditionally this was done by burying the shark in the ground, exposing it to several cycles of freezing and thawing. It is considered a delicacy in Iceland and Greenland. Despite being the Icelandic national dish (http://www.theexpeditioner.com/2011/06/16/my-encounter-with-hakarl-the-worst-tasting-food-on-earth/), its "putrid smell is said to rival its horrifying taste. When explaining hakarl to foreigners, Icelanders enjoy recounting the reaction of Anthony Bourdain who described the delicacy as the single worst, most disgusting and terrible tasting thing. Andrew Zimmern had a similar reaction, and even more disturbing, the smack-talking Gordon Ramsey reportedly vomited after eating it." - Mod.LL
