From: Jonathan Mayer <jmayer@hsph.harvard.edu>

I have had a few messages sent to me asking why I am "against" the Lyme
Disease vaccines, following my comments earlier this week on possible
paradoxical effects of the vaccine in people who, hypothetically, may gain
a false sense of security. I am not against the administration of the
vaccine at all. It probably will be a major advance, though questions such
as how long immunity lasts are still open. What is important is for the
public health community and health care providers who give the vaccine to
emphasize that the vaccines are not perfect, and that it is IMPERATIVE to
still use prophylactic behaviors against Lyme Disease, and also to
emphasize that the vaccine does nothing against other tick-borne diseases.

[It is unfortunate if someone interprets Jonathan's previous message as
being "against" the vaccine. He made very sensible comments about the
limitations of the vaccine and the appropriate public health procedures
needed to reduce the risks of disease associated with ticks. It should be
obvious to all of us that simple solutions are not always, by themselves,
the appropriate ones. Sometimes the best public health strategy involves
several preventive tactics. - Mod.PC
