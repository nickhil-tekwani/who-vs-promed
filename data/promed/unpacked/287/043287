Man hospitalized with suspected anthrax in Ulyanovsk region
---------------------------------------------------
A resident of the town of Sengilei in Russia's Ulyanovsk region has
been hospitalized with suspected anthrax, the deputy head of the
regional centre of the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations told
Itar-Tass on Wednesday.
Tissue samples have been sent for lab analysis. However, it is not
clear how long [the tests] will take, Nikolai Gerasimov said. Anthrax
bacillus was found in a fallen 7-month-old piglet. 4 people who had
been in contact with the piglet were hospitalized. They remain under
supervision of medics.

[This represents an additional 5th case in this outbreak. If "tissue
samples" have been taken, without notification of death, one can
presume that this 5th case is probably cutaneous.
One of the problems with this disease is that many in affected
regions don't take it seriously, because the incidence is sometimes
so hit-and-miss. In regions where sick animals are routinely
slaughtered and eaten, local experience tends to dismiss the risk,
because the locals notice that the disease does not invariably follow
upon butchering and eating the affected animal. This is a
non-invasive pathogen, so it can cause a skin lesion only if the
individual has cuts or scratches through which the organism may gain
entry.
Similarly, over-cooking can kill the spores, and prior exposure
results in a measure of immunity. In India blood tests have shown a
prevalence of positive titres in folk living in endemic areas, even
though they have no apparent history of being affected. Unfortunately
this makes for complacency, but in areas with chronic malnutrition
and rural poverty there may be little choice. - Mod.MHJ]
