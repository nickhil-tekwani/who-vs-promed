Some people in Yellowstone County are infected with salmonella, the
same strain that is making people sick in states as far away as Texas
and Pennsylvania. Now the Yellowstone County Health Department is
trying to figure out how they are connected. A communicable disease
specialist at the health department said they are conducting
interviews with the people infected here, and other states are doing
the same with their cases.
The information will then be sent to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), where experts will pinpoint the source of
contamination. "The CDC will run it through an EPI program, and it's
like a sorting program that goes through all the interviews and sorts
through what item it could be," said Tamalee Taylor, communicable
disease specialist at Yellowstone County Health Department.

Texas in south-central and Pennsylvania in the mid-Atlantic areas ?
see map below. ProMED and its readers would appreciate more
