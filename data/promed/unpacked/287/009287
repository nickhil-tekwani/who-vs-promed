Please find below for your information the latest communication from Dr. KH
Mak, Department of Health, Hong Kong in relation to cohort studies
conducted during the H5N1 "Hong Kong chicken flu" epidemic last year.

Cohort studies on avian flu
**********************
Results of three cohort studies conducted among healthcare workers on the
risk of influenza A H5N1 (avian flu) infection tied in with preliminary
investigation and observations of the Hong Kong Department of Health (DH)
during the occurrence of the avian flu cases in Hong Kong last year that
man-to-man transmission may have occurred but is inefficient. DH's
Consultant (Community Medicine), Dr Mak Kwok-hang, said today (Friday) that
the primary mode of transmission of H5N1 infection is believed to be from
poultry to man; most likely through contact with the faeces of poultry.
There is no evidence that H5N1 infection is transmitted to man from raw,
chilled or frozen poultry foods. "Infection control measures, like hand
washing and the use of masks is effective in reducing the chance of
man-to-man transmission." He noted that the preventive measures implemented
in the past 10 months had proved to be effective in preventing H5N1 in Hong
Kong.
"No new avian flu cases had occurred in Hong Kong since December 29 1997
after a number of measures, including chicken slaughter, were taken to
stamp out the virus. "On the cohort studies, Dr Mak said they were
conducted in hospital settings and aimed at comparing the prevalence of
influenza A (H5N1) antibody among healthcare workers exposed to H5N1
case-patients with the prevalence among non-exposed healthcare workers.
They covered 547 healthcare workers in three hospitals in Hong Kong with
influenza A (H5N1) infected case-patients and one Hong Kong hospital with
no known cases. Test results found a low seroprevalence of influenza A
(H5N1) antibody among both exposed and non-exposed healthcare workers. Of
the 547 healthcare workers, 10 were found to be antibody positive. This
represents three percent (i.e., eight persons) of the healthcare workers
exposed to case patients and one percent (i.e., two persons) of the
non-exposed healthcare workers. Six of the ten antibody positive healthcare
workers reported exposure to poultry. In addition, one antibody positive
healthcare worker with no reported poultry exposure had a four-fold rise in
antibody titer and a temporally-related febrile illness after exposure to a
case patient. The case suggested that influenza A (H5N1) was transmitted
from at least one patient to a healthcare worker.
Based on the overall low seroprevalence of H5N1 antibody among healthcare
workers, the evidences indicated that transmission of the virus from
person-to-person had occurred but was uncommon. These results are
consistent with results from the serologic investigation of persons exposed
to the first case of human H5N1 illness in May 1997. Consultant
Microbiologist of the Hospital Authority (HA), Dr Dominic Tsang Ngai-chong
said HA together with DH had provided counseling to the ten staff found to
have H5N1 anti-body. He pointed out that the Hospital Authority had issued
guidelines to staff on infection disease control. The results of the
studies also indicated that the infection control measures implemented in
the hospitals, which were known to be effective for influenza, would also
work for the avian flu. The cohort studies were jointly conducted by the
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta; the Hong Kong
University, Queen Mary Hospital; the Chinese University of Hong Kong,
Prince of Wales Hospital; Queen Elizabeth Hospital; Kwong Wah Hospital; and
the Hong Kong Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Department of Health.
