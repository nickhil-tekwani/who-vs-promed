West Nile virus (WNV), which is transmitted via mosquito bites, reemerged and spread to new territories of Greece in 2017 following a 2-year hiatus in reported human cases, according to findings presented at the 28th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) [Madrid, Spain, 21-24 Apr 2018].

During this reemergence, in the summer and early autumn of 2017, researchers diagnosed 45 cases from blood samples and cerebral spinal fluid from 180 patients who had symptoms and signs that probably indicated WNV. Prof Athanassios Tsakris, who is head of the Microbiology Department at the University of Athens Medical School, and his team of researchers analysed the reemergence and presented the findings.

The researchers diagnosed 26 patients, or 57.8 percent of the new cases, with WNV neuroinvasive disease. They characterized the remaining 19 patients, or 42.2 percent, with WNV fever [WNF]. The age of patients diagnosed with the neuroinvasive disease ranged from 15 to 91, with a median age of 63. Elderly patients with underlying diseases were particularly affected. Of the five patients who died (19.2 percent of those with neuroinvasive disease), all were older than 70.

All new cases emerged from southern Greece and most were reported in regions that had not been affected before. Of the 45 confirmed cases, 40 were in new territories: 37 in Argos and 3 in Corinthia prefecture. One case was reported in Crete and the remaining 4 were reported from previously affected prefectures of northwestern Peloponnese. Researchers analysed geographical data of the areas affected by the virus and concluded that Greece's landscape, such as natural and constructed wetlands, seem to influence the transmission and rate of new cases.

Prof Tsakris says: "The reemergence of WNV after a 2-year hiatus of reported human cases and its subsequent geographic expansion in newly affected areas demonstrates that Greece provides the appropriate ecological and climatic conditions for WNV circulation. The virus has been established in Greece and disease transmission may continue in the future."

"Epidemiological surveillance, intensive mosquito management programmes, and public education about personal protective measures are crucial to prevent WNV transmission, especially among susceptible population groups," Tsakris said.

"The risk of WNV transmission is complex and multifactorial; it concerns the virus, the vectors, the animal reservoirs, the environmental conditions, and human behaviour. Preventing or reducing of WNV transmission depends on successful controlling vector's abundance or interruption of human-vector contact. Also, targeted WNV surveillance within mosquito populations may contribute to the well-timed detection of the virus prior to its emergence in equine species or human populations," Prof Tsakris emphasizes.

WNV is transmitted to humans via infected mosquito bites. The transmission period is typically between mid-summer and early autumn when mosquitos are most active. Most people infected with WNV have no symptoms, but 20 percent develop West Nile fever, a flu-like illness that causes fever and body aches. Less than 1 percent of infections progress to diseases with sever neurological manifestations, such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis and acute flaccid paralysis.

Prof Tsakris explains that the dramatic decline in cases in the previous 2 years may be result of the mosquito management strategy, that is, the timely and proper use of effective larvicides, which has shrunk the populations of adult mosquitoes, and the preventive measures taken by the community to limit their exposure to WNV. Still, WNV continued to circulate in Greek territories as it was demonstrated by serological testing of birds in 2015, he adds.

"Additionally, the development of immune response against WNV may have reduced human cases by depleting the susceptible human population. It is also possible that WNV caused infections that were asymptomatic, as occurs in approx. 80 percent of cases, or that remained undetected including neuroinvasive cases," Tsakris says. "Of course, climatic conditions cannot be excluded since virus replication rate within mosquitoes, as well as vector competence and population dynamic, are mainly weather dependent."

The 1st outbreak of WNV in Greece was recorded in 2010 and was considered to be the largest epidemic in Europe since the 1996 outbreak in Romania. Most outbreaks in western Europe have been caused by WNV lineage 1. In eastern Europe, however, lineage 2, which emerged in Hungary in 2004, has been responsible for human and bird mortality, particularly in Greece.

[West Nile virus (WNV) is an RNA virus within the Flaviviridae family, a member of the Japanese encephalitis virus serocomplex. Mosquitoes of the genus _Culex_ mainly and to a lesser extent _Aedes_ spp. and _Ochlerotatus_ spp. act as vectors,

Infection from WNV has been an important public health issue for many European countries, including Greece, since 2010. WNV circulation has been recorded in several countries across the European continent, both in Central Europe and in the Mediterranean basin

Two main WNV genetic lineages have been reported by various research studies. Lineage 1 has been found in Europe, Africa, Middle East, America, Australia, and India, whereas lineage 2 has been initially recorded in sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar (https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2016/2450682/).

Key characteristics of West Nile virus (WNV) infection surveillance in Greece include (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5434877/):

Intersectoral collaboration
---------------------------
- The Ministry of Rural Development and Food and the HCDCP (Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention) share the results of human, animal, and vector surveillance with each other and with regional and local public health authorities, local veterinary services, municipalities and local health units.
- There are a multisectoral committee for the prevention and management of tropical diseases (including WNF) and 2 multisectoral working groups: for vector-borne diseases and for the designation of areas affected by such diseases

Human surveillance
------------------
- Since 2010, all laboratory probable and confirmed WNF cases should be notified.
- Enhanced surveillance is implemented at national level that includes awareness campaigns towards physicians, support of laboratory confirmation, active laboratory-based surveillance, cases investigation, and daily dissemination of information to national and local stakeholders.
- Measures for the safety of blood products are taken in line with the EU directive for blood safety.

Animal surveillance
-------------------
- WNF in animals is a notifiable disease and disease suspicions must be reported to the competent veterinary authorities.
- There is active serological surveillance of sentinel horses; active clinical surveillance of equidae (horses) around confirmed human and animal cases; passive surveillance of WNF in equidae all-year-round and some small scale surveillance in wild birds.

Vector surveillance
-------------------
- Since 2010, HCDCP together with the National School of Public Health, Universities, local authorities, and subcontractors, conducts active vector surveillance from June to October to detect WNV circulation in mosquitoes.
