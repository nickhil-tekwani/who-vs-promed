Deer ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_, also called blacklegged ticks) sampled in upstate New York simultaneously harbored the pathogens that cause Lyme disease and babesiosis at almost twice the expected levels, according to a study in PLoS One.

Researchers from the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (CIES) in Millbrook, NY, and elsewhere in the United States measured the infection prevalence in 4368 "questing" nymph ticks (young ticks seeking to feed) that were gathered in the field in Dutchess County, NY. They tested for _Borrelia burgdorferi_, _Babesia microti_, and _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the pathogens that cause Lyme disease, babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, respectively.

The investigators found that almost 30 percent of the questing nymphs were infected with _B. burgdorferi_, and a 3rd of those were also infected with at least one other pathogen.

Specifically, 6.7 percent of the questing nymphs (292) were infected by both _B. burgdorferi_ and _B. microti_, a rate 83 percent higher than would be predicted by chance alone. Infections with all 3 pathogens occurred in only 0.52 percent of ticks, and co-infection of _A. phagocytophilum_ with either of the other 2 pathogens was also low (0.53 percent and 2.4 percent).

"People in tick-infested parts of the United States, such as the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Upper Midwest, are vulnerable to being exposed to 2 or 3 diseases from a single tick bite," said senior author Felicia Keesing, PhD, in a CIES press release. "And, of course, that risk increases when they're bitten by more than one tick."

[The news report above refers to a recently published study that used the prevalence of coinfection in nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks to estimate risk of coinfection in people because nymphs are more likely to bite and transmit disease than adult ticks (Hersh MH, Ostfeld RS, McHenry DJ, Tibbetts M, et al: Co-Infection of blacklegged ticks with _Babesia microti_ and _Borrelia burgdorferi_ is higher than expected and acquired from small mammal hosts.

Abstract
--------
Humans in the northeastern and midwestern United States are at increasing risk of acquiring tickborne diseases -- not only Lyme disease, but 2 two emerging diseases, human granulocytic anaplasmosis and human babesiosis. Co-infection with 2 or more of these pathogens can increase the severity of health impacts. The risk of co-infection is intensified by the ecology of these 3 diseases because all 3 pathogens (_Borrelia burgdorferi_, _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, and _Babesia microti_) are transmitted by the same vector, blacklegged ticks (_Ixodes scapularis_), and are carried by many of the same reservoir hosts. The risk of exposure to multiple pathogens from a single tick bite and the sources of co-infected ticks are not well understood. In this study, we quantify the risk of co-infection by measuring infection prevalence in 4368 questing nymphs throughout an endemic region for all 3 diseases (Dutchess County, NY) to determine if co-infections occur at frequencies other than predicted by independent assortment of pathogens. Further, we identify sources of co-infection by quantifying rates of co-infection on 3275 larval ticks fed on known hosts. We find significant deviations of levels of co-infection in questing nymphs, most notably 83 percent more co-infection with _Babesia microti_ and _Borrelia burgdorferi_ than predicted by chance alone. Further, this pattern of increased co-infection was observed in larval ticks that fed on small mammal hosts [Northern short-tailed shrews, white-footed mice, masked shrews, and eastern chipmunks], but not on meso-mammal [Virginia opossums and raccoons], sciurid [Southern flying squirrels, Eastern gray squirrels, and North American red squirrels], or avian hosts [veeries, gray catbirds, wood thrushes, and American robins]. Co-infections involving _A. phagocytophilum_ were less common, and fewer co-infections of _A. phagocytophilum_ and _B. microti_ than predicted by chance were observed in both questing nymphs and larvae fed on small mammals. Medical practitioners should be aware of the elevated risk of _B. microti_/_B. burgdorferi_ co-infection.

In the USA, the prevalence of _B. burgdorferi_ infection in _I. scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 percent and 40 percent in New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, and Minnesota and Wisconsin, where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED, et al: The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. 2006; 43(9): 1089-134. doi: 10.1086/508667; available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full). In addition, _I. scapularis_ can be infected with _A. phagocytophilum_, _B. microti_, and _Rickettsia_ spp.

This topic has also been reviewed in an article by EA Belongia (Epidemiology and impact of coinfections acquired from _Ixodes_ ticks. Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2002 Winter; 2(4): 265-73; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12804168); the abstract is extracted below:

Coinfections occur with varying frequency in ticks. The proportion of _I. scapularis_ or _I. ricinus_ ticks coinfected with both _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato and _Anaplasma phagocytophila_ is generally low, ranging from less than 1 percent to 6 percent in 6 geographic areas. A higher prevalence of tick coinfection (26 percent) has been reported in Westchester County, New York. The proportion of _Ixodes_ ticks coinfected with _B. burgdorferi_ and _Babesia microti_ has ranged from 2 percent in New Jersey to 19 percent on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts.

Several studies have prospectively assessed the occurrence of acute coinfection. Among patients with a confirmed tickborne infection, coinfection rates as high as 39 percent have been reported. The most commonly recognized coinfection in most of the eastern United States is Lyme borreliosis (LB) and babesiosis, accounting for approximately 80 percent of coinfections. LB and human granulocytic anaplasmosis coinfections are less common, occurring in 3-15 percent of patients with a tickborne infection in Connecticut or Wisconsin. Studies of clinical outcomes suggest that patients with acute _Babesia_ coinfection have more severe symptoms and a longer duration of illness than patients with LB alone, but the risk of spirochete dissemination is similar. - Mod.ML
