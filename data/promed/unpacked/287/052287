Cholera is spreading in South Africa -- and fast. There have been more than
2000 infections in Limpopo, and Mpumalanga has recorded its 1st cholera
death. 9 new cholera infections were reported in Mpumalanga yesterday [14
Jan 2009]. This brings to 13 the number of people who have died from the
disease.

Department of health spokesman Fidel Hadebe said: "We are dealing with a
communicable disease. People are traveling from Zimbabwe [and] moving into
Gauteng and Western Cape." He said health workers "are working flat out.
Sometimes people seek help too late when they have complicated symptoms. We
are dealing with a complicated problem and we just cannot quarantine people."

An Mpumalanga health department spokesman, Mpho Gabashane, said the
province was on high alert after laboratory tests confirmed that a South
African woman who died on 5 Jan 2009 had succumbed to cholera after
visiting Zimbabwe with her husband. 9 other cholera cases were recorded at
Mpumalanga clinics and hospitals. Gabashane said the provincial health
department was monitoring the rivers in all the areas in which cholera had
been reported.

A spokesman for the Limpopo health department, Phuthi Seloba, said [the
number of] cholera infections in the province had reached 2023, with 49 new
cases confirmed yesterday [14 Jan 2009]. All the patients are South African.

Western Cape health department's spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said there had
been 7 cholera infections to date.

In KwaZulu-Natal, the department of health's spokesman, Leon Mbongwa, said
only 2 cholera cases had been confirmed in the province. 4 suspected cases
had been incorrectly diagnosed.

Gauteng has 33 cholera infections confirmed, and it is suspected that 173
people have contracted the disease, health department spokeswoman Phumelele
Kaunda said.

Both North West and Eastern Cape have been relatively unscathed by the
disease, but isolated cases of cholera infection have been reported.

A cholera outbreak has hit the Anyako community in the Keta Municipality of
the Volta Region, a development that has created fear and anxiety and panic
among residents. The Keta municipal director of health services, Dr Atsu
Seake, who briefed the Chronicle, said that 8 out of the 249 affected
people had already died. He said those who had been admitted to hospital
and clinics in the municipality are responding to treatment.

According to Dr Seake, the problem began on 12 Dec 2008, and he blamed the
situation on poor environment and sanitation practices in the community. He
disclosed that out of the 8 reported deaths, 7 of them died at home, while
only one died at the hospital.

Mozambique's new cholera outbreak in the northern region of Nampula has
killed 40 people. More than 60 others are seeking medical treatment daily,
health officials said here Wednesday [13 Jan 2009].

Nampula health director Flavio Wate told APA in an interview that most of
the densely populated suburbs in the provincial capital of Nampula
contracted the preventable disease after drinking contaminated water and
for practising poor hygiene. "We recorded 16 deaths as of January 2009 and
the rest died in the month of December 2008. We are working with the
communities in our efforts to reduce the consequences, should it continue
raining in the next few weeks," he said.

Radio Mozambique reported on Wednesday that 3 people died this week in the
neighboring province of Cabo Delgado out of the 60 cases reported this
month in the area. The health ministry said 103 people have died from the
epidemic from 10 200 cases registered since March 2008.
