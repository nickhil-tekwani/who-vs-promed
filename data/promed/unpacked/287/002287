Salmonellosis linked to Subway restaurants continues to plague the
state line with 2 cases now reported in Winnebago County. Those who
got sick ate at a Subway in Machesney Park. That now brings the total
to 60 cases of salmonellosis related to this outbreak in Illinois.
Normally this specific serotype is only seen in one or two cases a
year in the state.

Although health investigators say the bacterium has not yet been
linked to a specific product, they're narrowing it down by comparing
similar items that the infected people ate. In fact, Subway has
voluntarily replaced all its lettuce, green peppers, red onion, and
tomatoes, with fresh produce.

The illnesses are reported to have started between 11 and 25 May 2010.
Leaders with the Winnebago County Health Department say people who
choose to eat at Subway now should be safe.

"All the food products that are in question that the state has worked
with Subway, that are under question, have been pulled. Those products
are no longer in the stores. I would say that it is alright to go eat
at a Subway," says Sue Fuller, Public Information Officer with the
Winnebago County Health Department. Fuller says salmonellosis is not
typically deadly. But symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, fever and
stomach cramps. Salmonellosis usually develops within 72 hours after
being exposed to the bacterium and can last up to a week.

Certain Subway restaurants in 14 Illinois counties have been linked to
a salmonellosis outbreak involving the rare strain [serotype]
Hvittingfoss. The Illinois Department of Public Health and local
health departments throughout the state are investigating the cause of
salmonellosis among customers who ate at certain Subway restaurants in
Illinois. To date, 34 cases of salmonella have been confirmed with
this outbreak and all are recovering, of which 14 had been hospitalized.

Salmonella cases identified in this outbreak reported eating at Subway
locations in the following counties: Sangamon, Schuyler, Christian,
Bureau, LaSalle, Cass, Champaign, Peoria, Shelby, Warren, Macon, Ogle,
Fulton, and Tazewell. At this point in the investigation, no cases
have reported eating at Subway restaurants in either northeastern or
southernmost portions of Illinois. Illnesses are reported to have
started between 14 May and 25 May 2010 and cases range in age from 6
to 88 years old.

"We are aware of the investigation currently being conducted by the
State of Illinois Department of Public Health and are cooperating
fully as they attempt to pinpoint the exact product in question and
its origin," the company said. "The Subway brand will continue to work
with the Department of Health to assist in pinpointing the exact cause
of the outbreak."

[It can be difficult to pinpoint the initial vehicle of the enteric
pathogen if it is generally served in combination with others on a
sandwich or salad.

A 2005 outbreak (42 cases) of _S._ Hvittingfoss infection involving
several states in Australia was mentioned in a 2007 background
posting. The outbreak was associated with contaminated fruits or
vegetables. (Salmonellosis, eggs - Australia (QLD) (02): background
20070305.0771)

An earlier Australian outbreak of _S._ Hvittingfoss occurred in those
who had attended a private party in Brisbane in August 1997. There
were approximately 30 guests, 15 of whom allegedly became ill. The
party was a "bring-your-own-plate affair", and because of the range of
foods available and the time interval between the party and the
detection of this cluster, no further follow up was possible or
feasible. (Salmonella infections - Australia (Brisbane) 19970926.2021)
