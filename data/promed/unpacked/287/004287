Deadly strain seen in new Romania bird flu cases
-----------------------------------------------
Romania will send samples from new cases of bird flu detected in the
southeast of the country for testing in Britain next week, but
officials said on Sunday [4 Dec 2005] the birds had most likely
contracted the deadly H5N1 strain.
Late on Saturday [3 Dec 2005] the H5 strain of the virus was found in
poultry in the village of Ciocile outside the Danube delta, where the
highly pathogenic H5N1 strain was 1st discovered in October 2005, and
culling of over 8000 birds started. [Ciocile, the 4th infected site
in Braila, is situated at the southwestern tip of the county; see map at

"We are almost sure it's the N1 subtype, taking into account what
we've seen so far in Romania," Gabriel Predoi, a top official from
the national Animal Health Agency, told Reuters.
Predoi said officials would send the Ciocile samples to a laboratory
in Britain next week [3rd week December 2005] to be absolutely sure
it was the deadly strain.
TV images showed pictures of masked men in white overalls catching
and culling hens, ducks and geese in Ciocile, which was quarantined,
while local people watched, some with tears in their eyes.
Disinfection filters were installed on all roads leading out of the
county of Braila, home to Ciocile and 3 other villages where the
virus was detected over the past week.
Officials said all the outbreaks occurred in villages close to lakes
where migratory birds often rest. They repeated recommendations that
people keep their flocks isolated so they do not come into contact
with wild birds.
Veterinary inspectors stepped up testing and controls to ensure that
villagers abide by the recommendations in the area affected and in
neighboring counties.
In October 2005, the Balkan state became the 1st country in mainland
Europe to detect the deadly H5N1 virus in poultry in 2 villages in
the Danube delta, Europe's largest wetlands near the Black Sea.
The 1st bird flu case outside the delta occurred on 26 Nov 2005 in
the village of Scarlatesti, close to Ciocile and about 70 miles (110
km) from the delta.
Romania has not reported any cases of bird flu in humans so far.

Ukraine culls birds after confirmation of H5 virus
-----------------------------------------------
Ukraine was to begin culling birds in Crimea on Sunday [4 Dec 2005]
after an H5-type bird flu virus was detected in the southern
peninsula, and officials awaited test results to determine whether
the strain was of the lethal H5N1 variety that has killed nearly 70
people in Asia.
President Viktor Yushchenko placed affected areas in Crimea under a
state of emergency on Saturday [3 Dec 2005] after tests confirmed an
H5 bird flu virus in poultry that began dying en masse in the
peninsula's northeast 4 days ago.
"Today, we received laboratory results that confirmed the existence
of the H5 variety of bird flu on Ukrainian territory," Agriculture
Minister Olexander Baranivsky told reporters in Kiev.
The virus was found among domestic chickens and geese in 2 parts of
Crimea, a peninsula that juts into the Black Sea, after more than
1600 domesticated birds, including chickens, geese, ducks and
turkeys, had died in the region, Baranivsky said.
Samples had been forwarded to laboratories in Britain and Italy to
establish whether the virus is of the deadly H5N1 strain.
Yushchenko, who chaired an emergency government meeting on Saturday
[3 Dec 2005], ordered that the affected areas be placed under a state
of emergency.
A special commission, headed by Emergencies Minister Viktor Baloga,
would be in charge of all bird flu-related measures and would
determine the exact areas affected by the state of emergency, said a
presidential press service statement.
The 5 Crimean villages where bird flu-affected poultry have been
found so far and areas within 3 km (1.9 miles) of them were placed
under quarantine, and all poultry within them will be destroyed,
Baranivsky said.
Special teams were to go from house to house killing birds and
testing people for abnormal symptoms, Pyotr Verbitsky, Ukraine's
chief veterinary inspector, told reporters in the Crimean city of Simferopol.
Sales of live poultry have been banned throughout the peninsula, and
all people who had come into contact with poultry would undergo
regular medical testing and were expected to receive flu vaccination
shots, local health officials told reporters in Crimea.
The domestic poultry were likely to have caught the virus after
coming into contact with migratory birds, officials said. The cases
are near the Sivash saltwater lake in Crimea's northeast, a popular
stopover route for millions of migratory birds from Russia's Siberia
and Volga regions, as well as Asia, Verbitsky said. [This statement
is in need of clarification. It was previously stated that wide-scale
surveillance in migratory birds has been carried out in Ukraine, with
negative results. More details, and additional testing, are expected. - Mod.AS]
"The virus is behaving differently than in Russia and Romania,
Ukraine's neighbors where bird flu has also been detected," said
Verbitsky. "The sickness passes without any symptoms," he said. "In
the evening, the birds are healthy and in the morning they are dead."

[The described peracute course of the disease, if accurate, is rather
unusual. Generally, even with very virulent strains of highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus, affecting susceptible birds, death
is known to occur within 24 hours of 1st signs of disease, frequently
within 48 hours. The pathogenicity index of the Ukrainian causative
strain, when established, should clarify this observation. - Mod.AS]
