["Rabies is endemic in the canine population in the majority of Southeast Asian countries, where nearly all human rabies infections are transmitted via rabid dog bites. Controlling the disease in dogs, therefore, would be the most effective and cheaper way to prevent rabies in humans.

The last recorded animal rabies case in Malaysia was in 1999. The Animal Rabies Surveillance Programme was initiated by the Department of Veterinary Services in accordance with OIE standards in 1998 (OIE standards on rabies, which have been developed since then), but after an intensive campaign, no positive cases have been detected to date. With state and federal funding, Malaysia continues to implement initiatives that are relevant to rabies, including annual dog licensing, an annual rabies vaccination programme, and animal movement control in the immune belt, management of dog bite cases, and a national surveillance programme. The efforts sustained have reportedly been supported by sufficient legislation at local and national levels. The Laws of Malaysia Act 647 (Animal Act of 1953) cover special provisions relating to dogs in connection with rabies. This includes licensing (Section 38), management of rabies‐infected areas (Section 39), destruction or detention of an animal suspected to be infected with rabies (Section 40), detention of any dogs that have bitten a person (Section 41), and anti‐rabies vaccination in dogs (Section 42)" http://www.rr-asia.oie.int/fileadmin/SRR_Activities/SEA_Rabies_Strategy_-_OIE_Final_Draft.pdf.

See the Laws of Malaysia Act 647 (Animal Act of 1953) Rabies section at, http://www.vertic.org/media/National%20Legislation/Malaysia/MY_Animals_Act.pdf (pages 26 to 32).

Usually, with events such as these, both public and animal health authorities would work together to coordinate response and preventive efforts. It would be of interest to know what health measures have been taken to monitor and protect those exposed to the affected animal (the owner and his family and neighbors), as well as the outcomes of measures applied as indicated in this immediate notification.

[With an absence of so long it would be very valuable to have the rabies virus typed to get a lead on the source. This would have a valuable impact on the veterinary and public healh response to prevent any more cases. - Mod.MHJ
