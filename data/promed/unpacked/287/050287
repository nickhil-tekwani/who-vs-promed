The Florida Department of Health, Hillsborough County, has confirmed the 1st human case of locally acquired Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) [virus infection] for 2013.

Health officials say the individual was most likely infected earlier this month in the northwestern part of Hillsborough County.

The unidentified person is currently being treated for the virus and is "doing well," according to the county's FDH Director Dr. Douglas Holt. Holt says while seeing a case of EEE this early in the year is unusual, it's not surprising given the very mild winter we've had locally.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare disease that is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. The EEE virus is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).

In the United States, approximately 5-10 EEE cases are reported annually. EEE [virus] is only transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito, and does not occur directly from person to person.

The Florida Department of Health, Hillsborough County is working closely with Hillsborough County Mosquito and Aquatic Weed Control to reduce the risk of mosquito-borne disease throughout the county.

[The occurrence of a human case this early in the season does not bode well for the remainder of the year. EEE virus is endemic in Florida. The statement that the patient is doing well is good news. The USA CDC points out that "EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United States with approximately 33 per cent mortality and significant brain damage in most survivors." (http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/).

EEE virus infections in equine animals is also serious, and owners should have their animals vaccinated routinely. Unfortunately, there is no commercially available vaccine for humans. The best way to prevent infection is to avoid mosquito bites. Many local health departments also have mosquito control programs.
