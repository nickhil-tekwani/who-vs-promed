Franklin County reported its first confirmed case of a mosquito-carried
virus that killed another teen last week.
A13-year-old boy of Westerville, is in the intensive-care unit at Children's
Hospital. The hospital would not release his condition, but confirmed that
he has La Crosse encephalitis.
His is the 10th confirmed case reported to the Ohio Department of Health
this year, all involving children 5 to 14. There have been 2 cases in
Delaware, Morrow and Preble counties, and one in Columbiana and Portage
counties.
Another case was [another 13-year-old boy], of Thurston in Fairfield County,
who died of La Crosse encephalitis 1 Oct 1999. He was the first Ohioan to
die of the virus since 1996 and the seventh since 1963.
Only symptoms of the virus can be treated, but the disease is seldom fatal.
Most cases are mild and are not reported. Symptoms -- which include
headache, nausea, stiff neck and seizures -- usually occur within 5 to 15
days of infection.
The tree-hole mosquito transmits the virus, which causes inflammation of the
brain. The mosquitoes usually breed in stagnant water in tree cavities,
tires, buckets and cans.
Most infections occur between mid-August and mid-September, but cases can
show up as early as June and as late as October, depending on the amount of
rainfall.
The strain is different from the one in the New York area that has killed 6
people. [Instead of having a natural cycle in birds & mosquitoes, it has
one in wild rodents & rabbits & mosquitoes. It is a North American virus -
