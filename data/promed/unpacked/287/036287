Consortium set up to address new virus problem
----------------------------------------------
An IRRI [International Rice Research Institute] -- China -- Viet Nam
consortium has been set up to address concerns of the potential threat a
new virus disease carried by the white backed planthopper (WBPH) can pose
to rice production in Viet Nam and China. A set of action plans that will
include research, workshops, and training in pest and disease monitoring,
disease diagnosis, virus-insect-plant relationships, and management options
will be developed and implemented.

In August 2009, the spread of a new virus transmitted by the white backed
planthopper in the southern provinces of China was reported. At the same
time, many fields in the Red River Delta of northern Viet Nam were found to
be attacked by virus and samples examined by Vietnamese and Chinese
scientists confirmed the presence of a virus [similar to the one] found in
China. Virologists have labeled this virus Southern rice black streaked
dwarf virus (SRBSDV).

In November 2009, Chinese, Vietnamese, and IRRI scientists visited Hanoi
and found maize plants with virus symptoms. [They report that] SRBSDV can
also affect maize and several other grasses. Since these grasses are
alternative hosts of WBPH their abundance can increase the potential of
further virus spread.

[_Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) causes
serious crop losses in South-East Asia. On rice, symptoms include darkening
and distortion of leaves, black streaked tumours along leaf veins, and
severe stunting of plants. It also affects some other graminaceous hosts
including maize, wheat, oat and barley. It is spread by planthoppers
(_Laodelphax striatellus_, _Unkanodes_ species). WBPH (_Sogatella
furcifera_) is not a vector of RBSDV, but it acts as a vector for other
viruses of grassy hosts (_Pangola stunt virus_, _Echinochloa ragged stunt
virus_).

RBSDV and the closely related _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV) have both
been classed into the serogroup 2 of _Fijivirus_, which also contains other
viruses of _Gramineae_. The new virus was associated for the 1st time with
symptoms resembling black streaked dwarf disease of rice in Hunan province
of China. While its taxonomic classification remains to be confirmed, it
appears to belong to the same sero-group 2 of _Fijivirus_ and has been
tentatively named Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) or Rice
black streaked dwarf virus-2 (RBSDV-2) (Zhang et al. Arch Virol 2008; 153:
1893-8).

Disease management for rice viruses includes cultural practices, vector
control, and use of cultivars with reduced sensitivity or resistance to the
virus, the vector, or both. Cultivars resistant to the vectors tend to have
low disease incidence, but insect adaptation overcoming hopper resistance
has been a problem. The application of insecticides to migratory
planthoppers is being used in some areas to reduce disease incidence.

An increase in WBPH and other rice hoppers has been reported in areas
growing new hybrid rice in southern China, resulting in severe crop damage
and an increased risk of the spread of associated viruses. A similar
increase in some pests and pathogens in improved varieties has also been
observed in other crops and regions, and it has been suggested that this
may be due to higher insect appeal and/or an increased ability to sustain
pathogen replication of healthier, more vigorous plants.
