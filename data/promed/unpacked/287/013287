Two men with cutaneous anthrax have been put in the Rustava city hospital
in the past week. Both live in Akhali Samgori. They got the disease while
butchering livestock.
Azerbaijan journalists have asked their local veterinary administration
head about their national situation. Azeri livestock were vaccinated,
though some may have slipped through the cracks.
