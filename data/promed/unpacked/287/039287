Santiago de Cuba
----------------
The official weekly "Sierra Maestra" published on 5 July 1977 an article
saying that the number of cases in Santiago de Cuba is decreasing, without
giving any figures.
The independent journalist Haydee Rodriguez Rodriguez reports that
according to a trustworthy source who prefers, for obvious resons, to
remain anonymous, there have been 10 681 cases, and agrees that the numbers
being admitted to hospital there are declining.
Dr Dessy Mendoza, who publicly divulged the extent of the dengue epidemic
in Santaigo de Cuba, was arrested on 25 June 1997 and remains in detention,
facing charges of unlawful association and meeting and of "enemy propaganda."
Guantanamo
----------
Dr Walter Estrada Legen, a resident of Guantanamo, stated that there are
now 21 cases of dengue there, 6 in the Agostino Neto Hospital and 15 in
prisoners in the Combinado prison.
Camaguey
--------
Dr Leo Jimenez stated that 2 patients have died of dengue in Tamarindo,
Ciego de Avila province. One of them was a 44 year old woman who died on 4
July.
Carlos Manuel Guerra stated that trustworthy sources who prefer to remain
anonymous have reported 7 cases of dengue in Camaguey.
[Previous reports have indicated that the death certificates carry the
notation "hemorrhagic dengue," "disseminated intravascular coagulation with
symptoms associated with dengue," or "hipogolonico," literally "to die
without blood." An interesting feature is that in contrast to other
epidemics of dengue, only one of the reportedly fatal cases has been in a
child - Mod.JW
