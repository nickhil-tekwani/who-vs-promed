[The Chinese giant salamander (_Andrias davidianus_) is the largest amphibian in the world. It can grow to more than one meter (3.3 ft) in length. This species used to be widespread in central, south western, and southern China, but it is considered to be critically endangered. It has declined catastrophically over the last 30 years, principally due to over-exploitation, and it is now very rare, with few surviving populations known. Commercial over-exploitation for human consumption is the main threat to this species. It has also suffered from habitat destruction (such as from the construction of dams) and habitat degradation (such as water pollution from mines). For a picture go to http://www.factzoo.com/sites/all/img/amphibians/salamander/chinese-giant-salamander.jpg.

In 2010, an outbreak of disease occurred amongst farmed Chinese giant salamanders in Shanxi Province, China. Clinical signs included anorexia, lethargy, ecchymosis, and swollen areas on the head and limbs and skin ulceration. An investigation was carried out and they isolated for the 1st time a ranavirus infection associated with mass mortality in Chinese giant salamanders. This virus was named Chinese giant salamander virus (CGSV-L). This virus has not been studied in the wild. It might be possible that it circulates causing little impact, but under the stressing circumstances that might arise in captivity the virulence increases. - Mod.PMB
