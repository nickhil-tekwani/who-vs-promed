9 deaths due to mystery fever in Lucknow district, Uttar Pradesh
----------------------------------------------------------------
At least 9 people died of a mysterious fever in Lucknow on Saturday [16 Oct 2010]. A team of doctors from the health department has reached Khadra on the outskirts of Lucknow on Sunday [17 Oct 2010] but hasn't been able to ascertain what has caused the outbreak.

A 22-year-old man, who had been suffering from mild fever for the past 3 days, was the 1st casualty. He died about 5 pm at his residence in Roopnagar colony, Khadra. Subsequently, 8 individuals ([ages] 5, 25, 26, 28, 40, 41, 56, and 60), who were also suffering from fever, died. The majority of victims had been undergoing treatment at government hospitals. Chief medical officer AK Shukla confirmed the deaths. He said the 26-year-old had been suffering from malarial fever, while the 5 and 40-year-old died because of wrong treatment. "Both were suffering from a common form of viral fever but the line of medication administered to them was wrong. We are trying to find out the reasons behind the death of the other patients as well. It is a serious lapse. We have deployed a team of doctors there to diagnose all the residents who were down with fever," Dr Shukla said.

"At least 200 people are suffering from fever in Khadra. Registered medical practitioners have treated many of them. They are within our reach," he said. The child's father said the residents had also informed the health department, the municipal corporation, and the district administration about the outbreak. According to him, more than 30 locals had died in the past 2 weeks. The team of doctors reached the area only on Sunday [17 Oct 2010] though. " They claimed the 25-year-old died of malaria. But we know he had no symptoms of the disease and the health department has no facility to diagnose the other diseased [other diseases? the other diseased individuals? - Mod.TY]," the 5-year-old's father added.

[Apparently, this is not just an increase of the undiagnosed fatal fever outbreak that has been occurring in the Ramabai Nagar District of Uttar Pradesh. It appears to be a 2nd focal outbreak. There are no detailed reports of symptoms, other than fever and death, in either of these outbreaks. ProMED-mail awaits with interest the report of the medical team that visited the above outbreak site.
