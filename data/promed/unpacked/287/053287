Re: Russia's immediate notification report sent to the OIE on 24 Jun 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[The notification above included a] confirmation of an HPAI H5N1
outbreak at Uuvs Nuur [Ubsu-Nur], a lake in western Mongolia that
shares a shoreline with Russia.

This continues a strikingly similar pattern of wild bird outbreaks in
2006 and 2009 in the central Asian region, with wild bird HPAI
confirmed in Qinghai province, China (May 2006 and May 2009),
immediately followed by outbreaks in central/northern Mongolia (May
2006 and May 2009), followed by Uuvs Nuur (June 2006 and 2009). It is
unlikely that this pattern is due to biases in survey coverage as wild
bird surveillance in Mongolia, both through national authorities the
National Emergency Management Agency, State Central Veterinary
Laboratory and Mongolian Academy of Sciences, as well as
non-government partners such as the Wildlife Conservation Society are
extensive and cover much of the available waterbird habitat throughout
the country.

Surveys by all groups will continue in Mongolia throughout the summer
and into the autumn, and it will be interesting to see how things
progress.

[Dr Gilbert is gratefully acknowledged for drawing our attention to
the new Russian notification and to the similarity in the
epidemiological patterns of the previous central Asian outbreaks
affecting wild birds (2005 and 2006) and the current one. The species
affected on the Chinese territory have been discussed in ProMED-mail
posting 20090529.1998; any available details of the species affected
and tested in the Russian territory (map available in the OIE
notification at the source URL above) will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
