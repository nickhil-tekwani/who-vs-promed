People must not eat meat from cattle that have succumbed to unknown illnesses, the Deputy Head in the Department of the Dairy Herd Improvement Services in the Agriculture Ministry has said, following the unexplained deaths of livestock in Gutu.

Douglas Pakati said it was the duty of the veterinary services department to monitor disease outbreaks and determine the cause of death. "I am not aware of this mysterious disease that is reported to be in or around Gutu. But it is not advisable to consume meat from livestock that have died in unclear circumstances," said Pakati.

Pakati's comment comes in the wake of a mysterious disease outbreak in Gutu, which some experts have said could be anthrax. Although no cases have been confirmed, fears are that because anthrax is a disease that affects mostly livestock and wild game, the disease can affect humans through direct or indirect contact with sick animals.

The Deputy Veterinary Director, Field Service, identified as Mr Njagu, could not be reached for comment at the time of going to press.

[Latterly, anthrax outbreaks involving cattle have been reported in 2003, 2005 (58, involving cattle and goats), 2007 (11), 2008 (2), 2009 (3), 2010 (9), and on ProMED in 2012; the provincial distribution for 2011 is not available yet, but I think we can assume, on past performance, that there were outbreaks there in 2011. There were human cases in 2003, 2004, 2005 in significant numbers. Douglas Pakati was wise to issue a general warning. Of course, it would also be cost effective to have a provincial proactive control and vaccination programme, but that costs money, which is in short supply in Zimbabwe.
