Panamanian news reports the finding of an undetermined number of dead
sea turtles on the coastline of Veraguas and Los Santos. There are
indications that the deaths may be linked to a red tide detected
around Coiba Island, experts from the national evironmental agency
(Agencia Nacional del Ambiente, ANAM) said.
Trauma inflicted by fishing nets has been ruled out as the cause of
death, Francisco Carrizo, ANAM regional representative said. Dead
turtles have been found in the following beaches: Cambutal, Punta
Blanca, Verde, Cobachon, Colorado, Coloradito, Granada, Cierra,
Ventana, Tembladera, Restingue, Piro, La Puerca, and La Pita y Mato Palo.

The cause of the turtle die-off observed since the beginning of 2006
is still unknown, speakers from the Ministry of Environment (MARN),
the Ministry of Agriculture (MAG) and the National Centre of
Fisheries (CENEDEPESCA) said to the press yesterday.
The main hypothesis for the deaths of more than 100 turtles is the
red tide observed in the Salvadorian waters since November 2005, Hugo
Barrera, head of MARN said. Other suspected causes are heavy metals
and a sudden change in seawater temperature.
Dr J. White from the Wildlife Conservation Centre in New York has
taken samples and will carry out further analysis. Dr White said that
the main causes of die-offs in turtles are red tide and brain parasites.

[Although red tide may certainly be the cause of the turtles' demise,
simultaneous brain parasites in this many turtles would be very unusual.
We look forward to a report on the cause of these deaths. - Mod.TG]
