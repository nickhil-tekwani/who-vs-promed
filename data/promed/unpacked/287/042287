Christiana Scotland is the wife of Dr Thomas Scotland, one of the 5 doctors who died during the outbreak of Ebola. Currently, she has 4 children -- all males -- in high school but disclosed that she is faced with the constraints of paying their tuition. Though she is a university graduate, she can't seek a job, as she breastfeeds her 8 month old baby, and cash is hard to come by in order to supplement the breast milk he feeds on. She has called for support to families who lost their spouses during the outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus.

Dr Thomas Scotland was born on 20 Dec 1975. A graduate of the AM Dogloitti College of Medicine, he died on 18 Oct 2014 at a local ETU when he contracted the virus. Several students dressed in black, white and purple gathered at the auditorium of the AM Dogloitti College to memorialize fallen doctors and a medical student who died to save Liberia from Ebola during the peak of the crises.

Some of those remembered include Dr Samuel Muhumuza Mutooro of Uganda, Dr John Taban Dada of Uganda, who died on 9 Oct 2014 and a professor of the Medical College, Dr Samuel Brisbane, an instructor of the Medical College Department of Internal Medicine, Dr Abraham Saah Borbor who died 24 Aug 2014 and Malikee Siryon, a 5th-year medical student of the A M Dogloitti College who died on 18 Dec 2014...

[3] Liberia, utility of nanopore sequencing test
Date: 21 Dec 2015

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/12/news-scan-dec-21-2015

Separate Ebola studies published late last week [18 Dec 2015] in Emerging Infectious Diseases noted the efficacy of a field sequencing test and lessons learned by Dutch healthcare professionals from the 1st case there.

In the 1st study, an international team of researchers detailed the field performance of an approach based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in which whole-virus genomes were amplified in overlapping fragments to sequence Ebola virus RNA. After the approach was validated in non-human primates, the team tested it in Ebola patients in Monrovia, Liberia, from August 2014 through May 2015. Complete-genome phylogenetic analysis of viruses from the patients showed them being clearly distinct from Sierra Leone or early Guinea sequences but clustering well with all other sequences found in samples from Liberia, suggesting that Ebola viruses in Liberia resulted from a single or very few introductions.

The authors conclude, "Because of the device's small size and comparatively modest resource requirements, nanopore sequencing has tremendous potential for use in remote and resource-limited areas, and its implementation could revolutionize the capacity of public health professionals to perform sequencing during future disease outbreaks."

In the 2nd study, scientists from the University Medical Centre of Utrecht in the Netherlands reported the preparation involved and the lessons learned from treating the only Ebola patient in that country, who was admitted on 6 Dec 2014. They noted that waste management -- a task that was ultimately outsourced -- was their greatest concern. They also noted that the maximum time that healthcare personnel were allowed to wear the extensive personal protective equipment was 45 minutes, with an additional 20 minutes of recovery.

They concluded that treating even 1 patient was demanding on staff resources.

[4] Deficiencies of MSF Ebola triage system
Date: 18 Dec 2015

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/12/news-scan-dec-18-2015

The criteria that Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors without Borders) use in triaging West Africa Ebola patients resulted in more than a 3rd of patients falsely testing positive, and the guidance needs to be revised, a study yesterday [17 Dec 2015] in Eurosurveillance concluded.

MSF researchers and local public health officials analyzed data on 433 Ebola patients admitted into MSF's Ebola management center in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, from 1 Jul 1 to 30 Sep 2014. MSF uses 2 triage categories for suspected patients --"suspect" and "highly suspect" -- placing each type of patient into a separate ward.

The investigators found that 276 of patients (64 per cent) were true-positive admissions and 157 (36.3 per cent) were false-positive admissions, meaning they tested positive for the disease when they did not have it and would be exposed to a risk of Ebola infection when placed in a ward with patients who were actually infected.

The positive predictive value for receiving a positive laboratory result after being placed in the highly suspect ward was 76 per cent, and the corresponding negative predictive value was 54 per cent. Sensitivity of the protocol (the proportion of patients with the disease who test positive) was 70 per cent, and specificity (proportion without the disease who test negative) was 61 per cent. Ultimately, 254 (59 per cent) of admissions were classified as highly suspect, with the remaining 179 (41 per cent) as suspect.

The authors conclude, "The current triage system should be changed. Whenever possible, patients should be accommodated in single compartments pending laboratory confirmation. Furthermore, the initial triage step on whether or not to admit a patient in the 1st place must be improved. "What is ultimately needed is a point-of-care EBOV diagnostic test that is reliable, accurate, robust, mobile, affordable, easy to use outside strict biosafety protocols, providing results with quick turnaround time."

[5] WHO IHR emergency committee maintains (PHEIC) for Ebola

The 8th meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO director-general under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) regarding the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa took place by teleconference on Tuesday, 15 Dec 2015, and by electronic correspondence from 15-21 Dec 2015.

The committee's role was to provide the director-general with views and perspectives as to whether the event continues to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), whether the current Temporary Recommendations should be extended, rescinded or revised, and whether additional recommendations should be considered.

The committee remains deeply concerned that 34 countries still enact inappropriate travel and transport measures and highlights the need to immediately terminate any such measures due to their negative impact, particularly on recovery efforts. The committee advised that in this critical phase of transition, from stopping the original chains of transmission to managing new outbreaks most likely due to the re-introduction of the virus from survivor populations, often in densely populated areas, the EVD outbreak continues to constitute a PHEIC. The committee advised the director-general to extend the Temporary Recommendations [which follows].

21 Dec 2015 Liberia: celebrating a milestone in Liberia: closing an Ebola Treatment Unit
https://www.pciglobal.org/closing-ebola-treatment-unit/
[Liberia has closed its Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) in Ganta, Nimba County where the director for Project Concern International (PCI) Liberia's country director, Jolene Mullins, Dr Teweldebrhan Abrha (chief of party) and the team have spent the last year in this area mobilizing a team of health professionals to stop the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in Liberia. According to director Jolene, "It's a bittersweet celebration as we say goodbye to many members of our medical team who have fought Ebola since the early days and have become an important part of the PCI family."]

21 Dec 2015 Sierra Leone: Enhanced entry airport screening for Ebola to end for travelers from Sierra Leone to the United States
http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/s1221-airport-screening.html
[On 7 Nov 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Sierra Leone free of Ebola virus transmission. This date marked 42 days (two 21-day incubation periods) after the last known patient with Ebola tested negative twice for Ebola. On 22 Dec 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will remove Sierra Leone from the list of nations affected by Ebola that are subject to enhanced visa and port-of-entry screening.

Travelers leaving Sierra Leone will still require outbound screening measures, and the United States (USA) will continue to support Sierra Leone's Ebola virus disease (EVD) prevention and detection measures, including at its primary international airport. Outbound travelers are still encouraged to monitor their health for 21 days after leaving Sierra Leone and to contact their local health departments or seek healthcare if they develop symptoms consistent with EVD.]

22 Dec 2015 USA: CDC provides Delaware with guidelines on how to prepare for Ebola cases
http://news.delaware.gov/2015/12/22/ebola-preparation-cdc-provides-delaware-guidance
[New cases very unlikely in the state, according to health officials. In partnership with the Division of Public Health (DPH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently visited Delaware to offer assistance to DPH, Christiana Care Health System's Wilmington Hospital, and Saint Francis Healthcare on their readiness to identify, diagnose, and treat patients suspected of having Ebola or other emerging infectious diseases.]

21 Dec 2015 USA: Exaggerations about Ebola 2014
http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/dec/21/look-back-lie-year
[In 2014, there were just 2 Ebola-related deaths in the United States, yet fear of the disease stretched to every corner of the country, stoked by exaggerated claims from politicians and pundits. They said, wrongly, that Ebola was easy to catch, that illegal immigrants may be carrying the virus across the southern border, that it was all part of a government or corporate conspiracy. The false claims distorted the debate about a serious public health issue and edged the nation toward panic. In all, PolitiFact and PunditFact rated 16 separate Ebola claims as Mostly False, False or Pants on Fire, so we chose this collection as our 2014 Lie of the Year.]

Vaccine

21 Dec 2015: Sierra Leone ends Ebola vaccine study
http://makonitimes.com/2015/12/21/sierra-leone-ends-ebola-vaccine-study/
[According to Dr Mohammed Samai, the chief investigator in the joint trial that involved the United States CDC, who spoke on Mon 21 Dec 2015, Sierra Leone has shut down its Ebola vaccine study over a year after it started. Dr. Samai also said the trial conducted at the main Connaught Hospital in Freetown had enrolled nearly 9000 participants but that only about 8500 people were vaccinated. Dr Samai (who is also the provost of the medical hospital) also said, except from the normal vaccine-related side effects, there were no serious side effects discovered as a result of the trial. In addition, the study has equipped the university to the extent it can now handle any future similar situations.

Date: 23 Dec 2015 USA: WHO to review Merck's investigational Ebola vaccine for emergency use assessment and listing (EUAL)
http://pipelinereview.com/index.php/2015122360001/Vaccines/World-Health-Organization-to-Review-Mercks-Investigational-Ebola-Vaccine-for-Emergency-Use-Assessment-and-Listing.html
[The EUAL process is designed to expedite the availability of vaccines needed for public health emergencies such as another outbreak of Ebola. The procedure is intended to assist United Nations' procurement agencies and member states on the acceptability of using a vaccine candidate in an emergency-use setting. EUAL designation is not prequalification by WHO, but rather is a special procedure implemented when there is an outbreak of a disease with high rates of morbidity and/or mortality and a lack of treatment and/or prevention options. In such instances, WHO may recommend making a vaccine available for a limited time, while further clinical trial data are being gathered for formal regulatory agency review by a national regulatory authority.

Research
----
[Ebola virus and bats have been waging a molecular battle for survival that may have started at least 25 million years ago, according to a study led by researchers at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the University of Colorado-Boulder (CU-Boulder) and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) that was published online today in the journal eLife. The findings shed light on the biological factors that determine which bat species may harbor the virus between outbreaks in humans and how bats may transmit the virus to people.] [This is a very technical article. - Mod.JW]

22 Dec 2015 Liberia: Ebola mystery: Did a woman who tested negative infect her family?
http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/12/22/460700289/ebola-mystery-did-a-mom-who-tested-negative-infect-her-family
[Dr Mosoka Fallah, a Harvard-trained epidemiologist in Liberia, who specializes in tracing the origins of Ebola cases, is trying to determine how a father and 2 of his children became infected with Ebola virus in mid-November [2015] -- more than 2 months after Liberia had been declared Ebola-free. In the latest Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia (now resolved) there are questions that still need to be answered about the origins and causes of the outbreak. These questions include who was the actual source of the latest outbreak of EVD in Liberia, and can a pregnant woman who survived EVD once still harbor ebolavirus in immune-privileged areas of the body can infect their sexual partners if the woman's immune system is compromised.]
[The article is well worth reading. - Mod.JW]

22 Dec 2015 IMF: increases support to Liberian economy following Ebola outbreak
