[In the prior posting cited above, Dr. Badrinath noted the temporal
coincidence of this outbreak with the ongoing occurrence of Rift Valley
fever in Saudi Arabia. He inquired as to whether our readers might wish to
comment on potential epidemiological linkages. - Mod.ES

Vector-borne diseases tend to occur following a wet and warm season, the
same climatic conditions that favour typhoid. This is a logical deduction,
clustering of RVF and typhoid cases would have a common determinants, like
clustering of syphilis and gonorrhea would have common determinants, but do
not interact. [This is different perhaps from the clustering of HIV and
syphilis or chancroid.
