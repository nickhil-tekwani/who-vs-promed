According to the results of laboratory tests, the sample from the dead calf in the village of Zagoriche [Shumen oblast] tested positive for anthrax. This was announced on Radio "Focus" quoting Shumen's Dr. Katya Raykinska, director of the Regional Directorate of Food Safety. In addition, the carcass has been incinerated and the farm disinfected. All susceptible livestock -- 600 cattle and 900 sheep -- have been vaccinated. "A timely response requires that all hazards are avoided. Samples were taken on 13 Aug [2014]; control measures were immediately put into effect; and on 20 Aug [2014] we received a positive record of anthrax," said Dr. Katya Raykinska. She noted that at this stage there were no other signs of suspected infection in the field.

Frankly, it is unusual to see anthrax in a calf, so I suspect the affected animal was a yearling.

Shumen seems to be the oblast for anthrax in Bulgaria. It suffered an ovine outbreak in 2013, and 3 bovine outbreaks in 2012. It is presumably this consistent history that has persuaded the oblast veterinarians to vaccinate the sheep and cattle in Zagoriche this time. Latterly livestock vaccination in Bulgaria has not been done since 2009. As the disease is truly sporadic in Bulgaria, this is understandable. But we need to remember Kyriakus Polydoru's successful strategy for Cyprus that at this point annual vaccination should be tightly targeted at the areas were there are outbreaks occurring, while just keeping a sharp eye out for unexpected deaths elsewhere.
