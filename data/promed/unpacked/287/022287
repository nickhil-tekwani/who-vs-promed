Transmissibility of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in New Zealand:
effective reproduction number and influence of age, ethnicity and importations
--------------------------
S Paine, GN Mercer, PM Kelly, D Bandaranayake, MG Baker, QS Huang, et al.

Summary
-------
The 1st wave of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) has subsided in New Zealand as
in other southern hemisphere countries. This study aimed to estimate the
effective reproduction number (R) of 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) taking
into account imported cases. It also aimed to show the temporal variation
of R throughout the New Zealand epidemic, changes in age- and
ethnicity-specific cumulative incidence, and the effect of school holidays.

Using a new modelling method to account for imported cases, we have
calculated the peak R during the containment phase of the pandemic as 1.55
(95 per cent confidence interval (CI): 1.16 to 1.86). This value is less
than previously estimated in the country early in the pandemic but in line
with more recent estimates in other parts of the world. Results also
indicated an increase in the proportion of notifications among school-age
children after the school holiday (3-19 Jul 2009). This finding provides
support for the potential effectiveness of timely school closures, although
such disruptive interventions need to be balanced against the severity of
the pandemic.

Introduction
------------
The Federal Government of Mexico activated its national pandemic
preparedness and response plan on 24 Apr 2009 in response to a severe
outbreak of influenza-like illness, later identified as 2009 pandemic
influenza A(H1N1) [1]. It has been estimated that around 23 000 people in
Mexico were already infected with the emerging virus at that time [2].

The 1st cases of the pandemic influenza were imported into New Zealand on
25 Apr 2009, with a group of students returning from a school excursion to
Mexico. The arrival of the students triggered the activation of New
Zealand's influenza pandemic action plan and associated border containment
measures. In the following week, on 30 Apr 2009, non-seasonal influenza
A(H1N1) became a notifiable and quarantinable disease in the country.
Evidence of community transmission was detected from the 1st week of June
2009 (week 23), with a rapid increase in notifications lasting until the
epidemic peaked 5 weeks later [3]. New Zealand's sentinel general
practitioner surveillance system and non-sentinel laboratory surveillance
systems demonstrated that the pandemic virus had rapidly overtaken seasonal
influenza viruses, becoming the predominant circulating strain of the 2009
influenza season within 4 weeks of the detection of community spread [4,5].

To determine the transmissibility and spread of a disease, we need to know
the effective reproduction number (R), and how it evolves over the duration
of the pandemic. R is the average number of secondary cases generated by a
single primary case in the actual population. It is always less than the
basic reproduction number, R0, which is calculated by assuming a
hypothetical population with no prior immunity. If R is less than one, the
disease will not persist but will manifest itself in outbreaks of varying
size triggered by importations of the disease, whereas if R is greater than
one, there is a chance of a large outbreak. Over the course of an outbreak,
R is influenced by, among other things, actions that slow the spread of the
disease, such as behaviour change, social distancing [6,7] and antiviral
drug use [8], as a result of interventions.

There was considerable interest in the transmission pattern of the pandemic
virus during the 2009 influenza season. The R of the pandemic influenza was
estimated in a variety of settings and at different stages of the 2009
pandemic. Previous estimates include: 1.4-1.6 in Mexico [2,9], 1.3-1.7 in
the United States [10], 1.8-2.15 in New Zealand [11], 2.0-2.6 in Japan
[12], 1.39-1.49 in Peru [13] and 2.1-2.6 (1.5-1.8 after allowing for bias
in case ascertainment) in Victoria, Australia [14].

Differences in these estimates may be attributed to sampling strategies,
clustering due to heterogeneous mixing amongst teenagers, family and
various cultural groups, changes in the diagnostic coverage of infected
individuals, using data from only very early in an outbreak or not
accounting for imported cases. Different countries also had varying public
health interventions for reducing the transmission of the virus including
school closures, quarantine and antiviral drug prophylaxis, which may have
altered the transmission of the virus in certain settings.

This study aimed to recalculate R for disease transmission throughout the
pandemic in New Zealand (June-September 2009), using a new method that
takes into account imported cases, and to show how R changed through the
course of the 2009 winter. In response to questions posed in an earlier
paper by Baker et al. [3], we also aimed to describe the age-specific and
ethnicity-specific cumulative incidence during the pandemic in the country
and to examine the influence of school holidays.

Discussion
----------
In this study, we found that the peak R was lower than previously
calculated early in the New Zealand epidemic. There is also evidence of the
seeding of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) cases from Australia in the weeks
leading up to the detection of community transmission. When a pandemic of
an emerging infectious disease arises, it can be considered advantageous to
be isolated geographically from the threat. New Zealand, with its natural
oceanic borders, has a high level of geographical isolation. The most
likely way in which a new influenza virus could be introduced is the
arrival of infected air travellers who are not detected by screening at the
border [24]. Recent pandemic influenza activity highlights the
susceptibility of New Zealand's population to incursion of a novel
transmissible disease.

Short-term travel between Australia and New Zealand is increasingly common,
with more than one million visitors arriving from Australia annually. In
the month of June 2009, 298 267 people arrived by air from all countries
including Australia into New Zealand [25,26], providing multiple
opportunities for infectious travellers to arrive in the country
undetected. Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch regions all have
international airports that service flights between Australia and New
Zealand: Unsurprisingly, these were the 1st regions to experience an
observed escalation in community transmission. Early clustering in Pacific
peoples' community was believed to have been seeded by a member of their
community returning to Christchurch from Melbourne, Australia with the
virus in early June 2009 [27].

Australia's 1st observed community-acquired case of the pandemic virus had
an onset of symptoms on 16 May 2009 and was reported in Victoria, although
there is evidence to suggest that unobserved transmission was occurring in
Australia before that time [14]. By 4 Jun 2009, the state of Victoria had
reported a total of 977 confirmed cases of pandemic influenza to the
Victorian Department of Health [28]. At that time, New Zealand's confirmed
cases had been imported, although unobserved transmission had begun;
observed cases of community transmission appear to have been established by
the 2nd week of June 2009.

Young children and Pacific peoples contributed disproportionately to early
propagation of the pandemic in the country. It is possible that the school
holidays were associated with a lowering of the age-specific incidence rate
in school-age children. All schools had resumed classes by 27 Jul 2009,
which coincided with an increase in notifications lasting around a week
before declining in August 2009 as the epidemic tailed off.

The increase in confirmed cases among young children could suggest an
increased risk of exposure to the virus through infected older siblings or
that this age group is more likely to be presented at their general
practice for consultation. Data from the sentinel general practice
surveillance system were consistent with the proportions from the
notification data. Proportions of cases seen in the over 60 year old age
group were consistently much lower than expected.

The high proportions in the younger age distributions are consistent with a
lack of pre-existing antibodies to the pandemic virus in children and young
adults. Recent studies suggest older adults (over 60 years) have some
degree of preexisting immunity, and this may have contributed to lower
numbers in this age group [29].

When importations are removed, our method is in agreement with the early
results from New Zealand of R=1.96 [11]. Early in the outbreak, our
adjusted R value was 1.55 (CI: 1.16 to 1.86). As the epidemic progressed,
the calculated R value declined to around 1.0 (CI: 0.83 to 1.25) until the
management phase was implemented on 22 Jun 2009. This change in phase
impacted on the case ascertainment, probably affecting the adjusted value
of R. An increase in R in late June 2009 to around 1.25 (CI: 1.08 to 1.37)
is consistent with ongoing work on Australian data (unpublished) but is on
the lower end of other estimations [9,13].

The reduction in R below one around 12 Jul 2009 coincided with reduced
testing after implementation of the management phase. Public health
measures in place at the time and other factors such as voluntary social
distancing may have also contributed to the reduction in transmission of
the virus.

Other countries have reported high transmission rates in schools that have
contributed to high measures of R[12,14]. In New Zealand, the highest
numbers and rates were reported in the under one year old and 15-29 year
old age groups, indicating that there were high levels of transmission
occurring outside school settings. Reasons for this may relate to the
communities that were initially affected. Heterogeneous mixing of imported
cases into susceptible populations who interact in close proximity -- such
as cultural and religious communities and people in childcare centres, work
places and schools -- could have contributed to case clustering and rapid
transmission of the virus within those groups.

Complete ascertainment of imported cases was not possible during the
pandemic as travel information was only collected during the containment
phase during an active surveillance period. A change in the case report
form on 10 Jul 2009 meant the question was no longer asked.

There are difficulties in comparing values of R from this study with those
from other countries, as differences in generation time and modelling
methodologies vary across studies. Methods for modelling pandemic influenza
are evolving rapidly. Our analysis suggests it is important to consider
imported cases, particularly in the early stages of an epidemic.
Consequently, surveillance systems should attempt to record such status on
all cases at least until local transmission is dominant.

The data collected before the management phase commenced were influenced by
case clustering in Pacific peoples, which could have overestimated the
community-wide R value. Calculations towards the end of August 2009 are
less reliable as low numbers of cases were reported.

Conclusions
-----------
Using a new modelling method to account for imported cases, we have
calculated the peak R during the growth phase of the pandemic as 1.55 (CI:
1.16 to 1.86). This value was less than previously estimated for New
Zealand early in the pandemic but is in line with more recent estimates in
other parts of the world.

An increase in the proportion of notifications among school-age children
could be associated with the children returning to school after the July
2009 holiday. Although this relationship should be analysed further, this
preliminary evidence could support the effectiveness of timely school or
selected classroom closures as a potential public health intervention for
future influenza pandemics.

It should be noted that it is likely that it was the importation of the
virus through infected travellers from abroad that fuelled the influenza
A(H1N1) pandemic early in the 2009 New Zealand winter. Future resources
might be better focused on containing the spread of infection caused
through exposure to infected travellers returning to or arriving in New
Zealand, in particular, through early case and cluster detection, effective
contract tracing systems and the timely use of prophylaxis.

The overrepresentation of Pacific peoples and to a lesser extent people of
Maori ethnicity was observed during the containment phase and was probably
due to case clustering, The high proportions initially observed in these
groups decreased towards the end of July 2009 when all ethnic groups were
more evenly represented.

Descriptive epidemiology and modelling are useful for understanding how a
novel pandemic influenza virus affects a newly exposed population. They can
help measure how successful public health interventions have been in
mitigating the severity of the pandemic and estimate the potential
effectiveness of interventions before they are implemented.

During a pandemic of moderate severity, where most infected individuals
experience self-limiting illness, governments could consider public health
actions that target groups most at risk of infection and that cause the
least disruption to society. Applying mitigating measures of limited
benefit that have a disruptive effect on society, such as reactive school
closures in a relatively moderate pandemic, should be carefully scrutinised
before being implemented.

[The geographical location of New Zealand has provided a unique opportunity
for analysis of the transmissibility and spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009
strain of influenza virus and determination of the effective reproduction

authors conclude, among other things, that applying mitigating measures
such school closures during the course of a relatively moderate pandemic
may have limited value.
