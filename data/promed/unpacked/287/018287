Horse sickness not abating
---------------------------
Properties in the Kalbaskraal and Durbanville-Klipheuwel areas in the
Western Cape have been placed under quarantine because of a suspected
outbreak of African horse sickness [AHS], SABC radio news reported on Fri,
2 Apr 2004.
The death toll among horses stands at 16. 2 animals from an infected area
in Gauteng have been withdrawn from Saturday's J&B Met [a prestigious horse
race] at Kenilworth.
All other race entrants did not pose a threat of AHS transmission and were
being moved under special permits issued by the relevant provincial
veterinary authorities, SABC said.
Western Cape Agriculture Minister Johan Gelderblom said he was confident
the situation was being controlled in the best possible way.

[The same news agency reported on 17 Mar 2004, that -- following an
outbreak of the disease in a region of South Africa which was very close to
a zone traditionally free of AHS -- the European Commission was putting a
temporary ban on imports of horses from South Africa to prevent the
possible spread of AHS in the European Union. - Mod.AS]
