A viral horse disease that's more prevalent further west in Canada has returned to Manitoba for the 1st time in recent memory, as horses from 2 municipalities have been found with the virus in the past 4 weeks.

Equine infectious anemia (EIA) was confirmed in horses from a property in the RM of St. Clements, north of Winnipeg, in early June 2017, followed weeks later by a horse in the RM of Armstrong, in Manitoba's Interlake region, according to a report from the Manitoba Horse Council.

The Equine Disease Communication Center, an arm of the American Association of Equine Practitioners, has reported the Armstrong horse was sampled as part of an investigation by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency into cases in St. Clements. The latter probe also includes a horse that had been moved to a breeding operation in Saskatchewan.

A federally reportable disease in Canada since 1971, EIA is a "potentially fatal" viral disease affecting horses and other equines such as donkeys and mules, with no human health risk, according to CFIA. The disease has a history in Manitoba dating back to 1881, with the 1st recorded case in Canada, when it went by the name "swamp fever." However, the vast majority of Canada's cases in the past 20 years have been in horses in Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, and no cases have been reported in Manitoba in recent years.

Apart from Manitoba's new cases, EIA cases in 2017 have also been reported in the RMs of Torch River and Kinistino in northeastern Saskatchewan, at Mascouche in Quebec and in Beaver County southeast of Edmonton [Alberta].

Most EIA-infected horses show no clinical signs of disease but will be carriers of the virus for life and can be a source of infection for susceptible animals. Foals infected with EIA before birth are often aborted, or die within 2 months of birth.

In infected horses, the virus' incubation period can range from one week to 3 months, with symptoms including anorexia, depression, general weakness, intermittent fever, jaundice, small hemorrhages under the tongue and eye, swelling of the extremities, and weight loss. In some cases, according to CFIA, a loss of coordination may be the only clinical sign. Infected animals show temporary recovery from the severe stage of EIA and may even appear normal for 2-3 weeks before relapsing with similar but less severe signs, CFIA said. Episodes of clinical illness are often associated with use of steroids or with periods of stress, such as hard work, hot weather, racing, or pregnancy.

Horses or other equines confirmed with EIA are then either ordered destroyed by the CFIA or undergo lifelong quarantine.

EIA is transmitted mainly by transfer of contaminated blood from one animal to another, such as through horse flies, stable flies or deer flies, or when blood-contaminated objects such as needles or surgical tools are used on more than one animal. It can also be transmitted via semen from an infected stallion.

The disease so far has no cure, CFIA said, or any vaccine to prevent an animal from becoming infected.

[To quote the Merck Manual: "All equids shipped across state lines in the USA [and presumably between Canadian Provinces] must be tested for EIA with a negative result within 12 months before transport. All equids sold, traded, or donated within a state must have tested negative for EIA no more than 12 months before change in ownership and, preferably, no more than 60-90 days. All equids entering horse auctions or sales markets are required to have a negative test before sale, or the horse must be held in quarantine within the state until the test results are known.

It is recommended that horse owners implement an EIA control plan for their premises. All horses should be tested every 12 months as part of a routine health program. More frequent testing may be indicated in areas that perennially have a high incidence of EIA. Owners of equids entering shows or competitive events should present proof to event officials of a negative EIA test. All new equids introduced to a herd should have a negative EIA test before entry or be isolated while tests are pending. Vector control practices, including application of insecticides and repellents and environmental insect control, should be implemented. Good hygiene and disinfection principles should be maintained to prevent iatrogenic infection of horses with contaminated needles, syringes, or equipment."

This is an expensive infectious disease spread by hemophagic insects. "Under natural conditions, the most important mode of transmission of EIA is by the transfer of virus-infective blood by blood-feeding insects between horses in close proximity. Virus is found free in the plasma or is cell-associated, principally in monocytes and macrophages of infected animals. Although infection is considered primarily blood borne, all tissues and body fluids are potentially infectious, especially during episodes of clinical disease when viral burdens are high. Transmission of EIA by biting flies is purely mechanical; the virus does not replicate in the vector. The chance of transmission of EIA is directly proportional to the volume of blood retained on the mouthparts of the insect after feeding. In that respect, horse flies, deer flies, and to a lesser extent, stable flies are likely the most efficient vectors. It is also because they are capable of triggering host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in their seeking a new susceptible host to complete their blood meal." But don't forget bloody needles. - Mod.MHJ
