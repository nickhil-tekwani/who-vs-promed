[All 7 outbreaks recorded in Israel since 31 Dec 2006 have affected
grazing beef cattle, fattening units or goats, particularly involving
young animals before their primary vaccination or following a single
vaccination without booster. The experience during more than 20 years
shows that dairy cattle escape infection during FMD outbreaks due to
biosecurity measures and to the intensive vaccination scheme in dairy
farms and its strict implementation. One may hope that this tradition
is maintained during the current outbreak, which otherwise will
follow the spread routes experienced many a time before. - Mod.AS]
