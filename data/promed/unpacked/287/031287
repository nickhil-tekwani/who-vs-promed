During the 1998-99 season, maize plants showing viruslike symptoms were
observed at 2 locations in Andhra Pradesh, India. Several hybrids were
evaluated at Hyderabad in a replicated yield trial and most were affected,
with disease incidence ranging from [about 4 to 61 percent of the plants
among plots. Hybrid 4642 (Proagro 3-way hybrid, late maturity) and the
pre-commercial hybrid YLY102 were the most susceptible, whereas the popular
hybrid 4640 was among the least susceptible entries. In seed production
fields near Eluru, incidence ranged from 10 to 15% among plots, with the
female parent of hybrid 4210 (Proagro 3-way hybrid, early maturity) being
especially affected.
Symptoms observed in hybrids varied, presumably, according to [time of
infection and included severe plant dwarfing, dark-green leaves, enations
on the lower leaf surface, and small malformed ears with few or no kernels.
[Extracts from symptomatic and asymptomatic field plants (root and leaf
tissues) were tested by ds-RNA polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by
DAS-ELISA with antiserum to mal de rio cuarto [fiji virus (MRCV). MRCV and
maize rough dwarf [fijivirus (MRDV) were selected as controls because
symptoms were similar to those caused by these maize viruses (1,2). ds-RNA
gels from symptomatic plants showed 10 bands with banding patterns
different from those of MRCV or MRDV. DAS-ELISA indicated a distant
relationship to MRCV.
These results provide evidence of a reovirus infection [in maize hybrids
in India and suggest that a virus belonging to the Reoviridae, genus
Fijivirus [causes this new disease. The high disease incidence and the
severity of symptoms should alert breeders and pathologists in southern
Asia about potential yield losses.

[Wheat is a new, natural host of MRCV in Argentina. It would be interesting
to know if wheat is naturally infected by the reovirus in India. 2
