As of 18 Dec 2006, the Ministry of Health, Togo reported 3 cases of
yellow fever in 2 adjacent districts, Dankpen district, Kara region
and Oti district, Savanes region in the northern part of the country.
Yellow fever has been laboratory confirmed in the 3 cases (males aged
9, 15 and 20) by Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal.
A team from the Ministry of Health and the WHO country office are
currently carrying out a field investigation. Since the most recent
mass vaccination campaign in this area was conducted in 1987, there
are concerns for a highly susceptible population. The Ministry of
Health will be requesting additional vaccine from the International
Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Yellow fever
Control to rapidly respond to outbreaks [and?] to carry out a mass
vaccination campaign, with the support of WHO and UNICEF. A stockpile
of 6 million doses of yellow fever vaccine is provided annually by
the GAVI Alliance to rapidly respond to outbreaks.

[This situation illustrates the dilemma of attempting to maintain
good herd immunity through costly routine yellow fever vaccination
programs, or waiting until cases are detected and then mounting an
emergency immunization effort.
The risk with the latter approach is, of course, that transmission
could get out of hand, especially in populous areas where the vector
_Aedes aegypti_ is abundant. Togo has a population of 5.4 million.
Rapidly immunizing this number, or even a small subset in the areas
where the cases occurred, will not be easy or inexpensive. This WHO
EPR report does not comment on the vector situation in Togo, nor what
vector control measures are being implemented. ProMED will appreciate
receiving updates on this situation.
