[1] Leaf & sheath blights, undiagnosed rot - Bangladesh

The prospects of aman [a group of lowland rice varieties] paddy seem
bleak in Kurigram and Lalmonirhat districts, as paddy plants on vast
areas of land are affected by disease. Farmers and rice dealers in
the 2 districts are anxious about a possible shortfall in aman
production due to diseases and have expressed apprehension that the
yield of aman paddy will decrease by almost half compared to last year [2007].

However, Agriculture Extension Department (AED) officials said the
problem is not so grave and that only 5 percent of aman plants in the
district were attacked by sheet blight and rot blight. Kurigram AED
Deputy Director Mohshin Ali said, "Heavy rainfall in the last 5 days
helped plants recover from the attack of leaf blight disease."

Several farmers of Lalmonirhat district, however, refuted the
versions of AED officials and said about 60 percent of aman paddy
plants in the district have been attacked with sheet blight and rot
blight. "Aman paddy plants on 34 acres of my land were attacked with
diseases," said Reazul Hoque Patwari of Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila
[subdistrict]. Abdur Rahman of Rajarhat upazila in Kurigram district
said aman paddy plants on 23 acres of his land are becoming
yellowish. "I cultivated aman paddy on 20 acres of land. Plants got
yellowish, and within 7 days they got dried. I can hardly get 20
maunds [ca. 746 kg] of paddy from the land," Motahar Hosen, a farmer
of Lalmonirhat Sadar upazila said.

[2] Bacterial leaf blight - Pakistan: (Punjab), alert

The Pest Warning Wing of the Agriculture Department, Punjab has
warned growers of late-[planted] rice varieties to keep a vigil on
their crop, as an attack of Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) might occur
in some areas. Director General Pest Warning Dr Ijaz Parvaiz during a
press briefing by the Punjab Agriculture Minister Malik Ahmad Ali
Aulkah told newsmen that symptoms of the disease have been reported
in 25 percent of areas of those regions where rice was sown late.

He said these areas include Hafizabad, Kamoke, Gujranwala, Sialkot,
Okara, Nankana Sahib and Baddo Malhi. He said that the farmers should
remain vigilant in these areas, and, as soon as a symptom of attack
of the disease is found, they should spray copper-based fungicide on
their crop to save it. He said that this disease appears in patches
and could be controlled in its initial phase. "It is hard to control
this disease at later stages," he said.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern
Australia, Africa, and the USA. The pathogen causes yellowing and
drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and reduces yield. Yield
losses of up to 60 percent have been reported in Asia. The bacterium
is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed-borne, and it is
spread mainly by windblown rain and mechanical means. Disease
management includes phytosanitation, cultural measures, and use of
resistant crop varieties. For more information on BLB, please see
previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.

Sheath blight (called "sheet blight" in report [1]) is caused by the
fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_. Symptoms include expanding lesions
on sheaths of leaves near the water line during the late tillering or
early internode elongation growth stages. Infection spreads rapidly
in the field by runner hyphae or plant-to-plant contact. Yield losses
of up to 50 percent in highly susceptible cultivars result from
poorly filled grain heads and from reduced plant vigour. Fungal
sclerotia survive for long periods in the soil and float to the
surface of flooded rice fields causing infection in the next crop.
The fungus can also attack a number of weed hosts, which can serve as
reservoirs. No reliable source of genetic host resistance has been
identified so far. Disease management includes cultural and
phytosanitary techniques and foliar fungicides. For further
information see ProMED-mail post 20070718.2300.

The name "rot blight" mentioned in item [1] is not commonly used for
any rice disease, and it is not clear which pathogen is referred to.
We would be most grateful for information from anyone familiar with this term.
