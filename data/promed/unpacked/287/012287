At least 50 cattle died from nitric poisoning at a dairy farm in Dorbeshpur union of Ramganj upazila [sub-district], Lakshmipur [district in Chittagong division], last week [week of 20 Jan 2014]. The owner of Amy Dairy Farm, said; "I have to endure losses of around Tk [Taka] one crore [unit equal to 10 million; about USD 130 000] because of the 50 cattle that died from disease."

He said that he had acquired a loan of Tk 5 crore [about USD 650 000] and invested it in the dairy. Chief scientific officer (PSO) of Feni, Dr Nurul Amin, said; "The amount of the poison has increased in the grass beside the farm." Chief scientific officers of Chittagong's divisional, local animal disease investigation laboratory, and veterinary specialists of Feni visited the farm on Saturday [25 Jan 2014].

They collected samples through the necropsy of the cattle. According to sources, the disease had spread through the fodder. UNO [chief executive of a sub-district] Kazi Mokbubul Alam said; "A 5 member committee was formed by appointing the upazila livestock official as convener."

"We may submit a report to the ministry concerned to provide compensation to the farm owner," the UNO said. District Livestock Officer Abu Al Mansur, Sadar Upazila Livestock Officer Dr Md Mostafa Ashraf, Raipur Upazila Livestock Officer Abdul Motaleb, Ramganj Upazila Livestock Officer Md Zakir Hossain, and Upazila Milk Vita Manager Dr Ashraful Islam paid a visit to the farm on Thursday [30 Jan 2014].

[There are certain grasses that are capable of accumulating nitrate. Nitric acid would be something applied to the grass vs the grass accumulating nitrate. Grasses high in nitrates can kill cattle rapidly.

Alternatively some grasses may accumulate prussic acid, a type of cyanide. Prussic acid, hydrocyanic acid, and hydrogen cyanide are all terms relating to cyanide poisoning. Certain grasses may accumulate large quantities of cyanogenic glycosides, (a sugar compound with cyanide attached) which are located in the outer tissue or epidermal layer of the plant.

An enzyme resides in the inner or mesophyll leaf tissues. When an event stresses the plant, such as frost, drought, drought followed by rain and a sudden burst of growth, or trauma to the plant, the mesophyll portion of the plant or leaf releases the enzyme, which breaks down the cyanogenic glycosides releasing the cyanide compound and the sugar. The sugar makes the plant tasty and cyanide makes the plant deadly.

The article is unclear if this is nitrate, or prussic acid, or both. However, grasses do not accumulate nitric acid. - Mod.TG
