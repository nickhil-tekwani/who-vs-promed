The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed a case of enterovirus-71
(EV-71) infection involving a 9-month-old boy, bringing the year's total
cases to 11. The baby fell ill on Tue 27 Jun 2006 and was admitted to
Princess Margaret Hospital 3 days later. His condition is stable and his 5
family members have no symptoms.
Good personal hygiene and ventilation should be maintained to prevent EV-71
infection. Parents should seek medical advice if their children develop
symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease. Infected children should stay at home
and avoid contact with others.
In 2005, 8 EV-71 cases were recorded, whereas 35 were recorded in 2004. For

A 2-year-old boy has become the 11th child to die in an epidemic of hand,
foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Malaysia's eastern state of Sarawak, a
official said on Sun 9 Jul 2006. Deputy Chief Minister George Chan said the
boy died on Fri 7 Jul 2006 but described the death as an isolated case. The
State has been battling the outbreak since February and the number of cases
had declined in recent months. The critically ill boy was first admitted to
a local hospital on Thu [6 Jul 2006] but died the following day despite
being flown to Miri hospital.
Chan said the number of new cases had dropped to around 200 to 250 per week
since mid-April from between 1000 and 1300 cases per week previously. The
illness affects mainly infants and young children, causing painful mouth
and throat ulcers, fever and blisters on hands and feet.
The Health Ministry on 3 Mar 2006 ordered the closure for a few weeks of
all 488 kindergartens and child-care centres in Sarawak, which is on the
island of Borneo. Sarawak has been hit periodically by the disease. In the
worst outbreak in 1997, 31 people died.

[HFMD is a common illness of infants and children, characterized by fever,
sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters. It begins with a mild fever,
poor appetite, malaise, and frequently a sore throat. One or 2 days after
the fever begins, painful sores develop in the mouth, usually on the
tongue, gums, and inside of the cheeks. The skin rash develops over 1-2
days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters, usually on the
palms of the hands and soles of the feet -- hence the name.
HFMD is usually associated with infection by human coxsackievirus A16 or
human enterovirus 71 (EV-71). Occasionally cases due to infection by other
group A or B B coxsackieviruses have been recorded. Coxsackievirus A16
infection is normally a mild disease and nearly all patients recover
without medical treatment in 7 to 10 days. Complications are
uncommon. EV-71 may also cause viral meningitis and, rarely, more serious
diseases, such as encephalitis, or a poliomyelitis-like paralysis. EV71
encephalitis may be fatal. Cases of fatal EV-71-associated encephalitis
have occurred during outbreaks of HFMD in Malaysia and Taiwan [see
ProMED-mail references below]. The case in Hong Kong has been diagnosed as
due to EV-71 infection and it is likely that the same virus is responsible
for the outbreak in Sarawak, although that is not stated specifically in
the above report.
