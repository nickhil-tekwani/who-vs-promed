6th case of mad cow disease confirmed in Poland
-----------------------------------------------
A new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; also known as mad cow
disease) was confirmed in Poland on Sat, 9 Aug 2003, bringing the number of
the cattle infected in the country to 6.
The 5 year old cow from Malopolska tested positive for the disease after a
laboratory in Krakowskie discovered the [prion] during a test program at a
slaughterhouse located in Malopolska, medical officials said.
BSE is an infectious disease that is believed to spread by recycling meat
and bones from infected animals and grinding them into cattle feed. Until
now, the brain wasting malady has occurred in many European countries. The
first case in Poland was detected in May 2002, also in Malopolska.

[Following the detection of its 1st BSE case in May 2002, Poland recorded 3
more cases in 2002, all separately reported to the Office International des
Epizooties (OIE). The 5th case was added to the OIE's BSE statistics on 28
Feb 2003 (see ProMEDmail posting: BSE update 2003 (03) 20030321.0701). BSE
is a list B disease, thus only 1st cases in a previously unaffected country
are required to be immediately reported to the OIE; otherwise they are
included in periodic reports.
The age of the new case indicates that contaminated animal feed might still
have been circulating in Poland in 1998 or even later. Details on the age
of the previous (5th) affected cow will be of interest. - Mod.AS]
