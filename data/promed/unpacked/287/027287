The recent discovery of chronic wasting disease [CWD] in a deer at a breeding farm near Goodman in Marinette county prompted the Florence county board on [Tue 17 Jul 2018] to impose moratoriums both on importing any cervids -- deer, elk, moose, or caribou -- into the county and establishing or expanding any cervid game farms in the county.

The board also will begin the process of crafting an ordinance so the moratoriums will have some "teeth," board chairwoman Jeanette Bomberg said. With an ordinance in place, officers will be able to ticket offenders, she explained.

Only one deer farm exists in Florence county, on 40 acres [about 16 ha] in the town of Fence and crossing over into Forest county.

No CWD case has yet been confirmed in Florence county, Florence County Deer Advisory Council chairman Dale Ebert said, but he pointed out the Goodman-area farm with the CWD-positive deer is less than 10 miles [about 16 km] from both Florence and Forest counties.

Due to the proximity, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has enacted a ban on feeding or baiting deer in Florence and Forest counties, as well as Marinette County. The ban lasts 2 years, but could be renewed if more deer in the area test positive for CWD, Ebert said.

Residents still can feed birds and small mammals, as long as the feeding devices are within 50 yards of a home and at a sufficient height to prevent deer access, according to the DNR.

CWD is a fatal neurological disease in cervids caused by an infectious protein that affects the animal's brain. It can be spread in game farms and in the wild through movement of infected animals, fence failures, escapes, contaminated soil moved off site by wind and water, contaminated trailers and equipment, and nose-to-nose contact, according to the board's moratorium resolution.
