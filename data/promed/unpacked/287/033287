A number of years ago all mosquitoes on an isolated island owned by Marlon
Brando in the South Pacific were successfully eradicated when a tropical
storm passed through and leveled everything in sight. (The mosquitoes are
probably back by now). It's been several decades since the "success" of the
DDT mosquito eradication program. No one (with much credibility) that I
know in operational mosquito control believes that even a young Brando can
duplicate the South Pacific feat in any but the most isolated (sub)tropical
locales. Any knock out, whatever the incentive, would be temporary,
limited, leading to yet another round of symposia, funding....
These remarks are not intended to denigrate coordinated control efforts,
only to emphasize their limitations.

[No question there are limitations, including insecticide resistance,
funding, political will, intellectual input, culture, climatic conditions,
administrative incompetence, arrogance, ignorance, and stone-walling, among
others. Certainly we cannot expect to kill mosquitoes by spraying them
with insecticides and walking away successful. Nonetheless, if I recall
correctly, _Aedes aegypti_ was eradicated from areas of the Western
Hemisphere until the US started exporting their eggs in used tires,
reversing all previous gains.
Finally, last I saw Marlon Brando he was an island. - Mod.CHC
