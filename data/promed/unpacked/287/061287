First report of cotton leaf curl disease affecting chili peppers
----------------------------------------------------------------

Stress Biology, The John Innes Centre, Colony Lane, Norwich, NR4 7UH, UK).
Accepted for publication 8 Jul 2003.
Cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD) is an important disorder of cotton in
Pakistan and Western India and is associated with begomovirus species. A
symptom modulating DNA satellite (CLCuD DNA b ) is also required to induce
CLCuD (1,2).
Recently a CLCuD begomovirus/DNA b complex that overcomes disease
resistance in cotton has been found in Pakistan (3). This prompted efforts
to identify alternate host plants that may affect the epidemiology. A
survey of cotton growing areas in 2002/2003 found typical CLCuD symptoms,
leaf curling (LC) and vein thickening (VT), on chili pepper (_Capsicum annum_).
Chili pepper production often overlaps with cotton in Pakistan and might
serve as an important inoculum source. Chili peppers with LC have been
shown to contain begomoviruses and a distinct DNA b has been isolated (4).
But there are no reports of CLCuD affecting chili pepper.
To assess CLCuD in chili pepper, plants with LC and VT were collected from
the Vehari and Khanewal districts of Punjab province. To identify the
begomoviruses present, total DNA was isolated from leaf samples, resolved
in agarose gels and blotted onto nylon membranes. A sample from the Jhang
district previously shown to contain chili leaf curl disease (ChLCD) DNA b
was included.
Blots were probed with a non-radioactive probe derived from cotton leaf
curl Multan virus (1) and washed at low stringency. A positive signal was
detected in all symptomatic chili pepper samples. Polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using primers CLCV1 [5'-CCGTGCTGCTGCCCCCATTGTCCGCGTCAC-3'] and CLCV2
[5'-CTGCCACAACCATGGATTCACGCACAGGG-3'], designed to conserved sequences of
begomoviruses isolated from cotton and okra, produced products of the
expected size from all symptomatic samples.
DNA b was determined by PCR using a set of universal primers (4). An
amplicon of the expected size (approx. 1350 nucleotides) was produced in
assays of all symptomatic samples.
Southern blots of extracts from symptomatic chili peppers, probed with
CLCuD DNA b and washed at high stringency yielded a strong signal in
samples from Vehari and Khanewal districts but not from the Jhang district.
The results confirm the presence of CLCuD DNA b in chili pepper. This is
the first report of CLCuD in this crop.

[In addition to its presence in Pakistan, CLCuV has been reported in Egypt,
Sudan, Central Africa, and Malawi, and similar symptoms have been reported
in Chad, Togo, Nepal, and West Africa. Cotton is the primary natural host,
but it is interesting to note that ClCuV also infects watermelon
(_Citrullis lanatus_). Watermelon leaf curl disease in Pakistan is
associated with tomato leaf curl India virus (ToLCV-In). Other natural
hosts of CLCuV are _Solanum nigrum_ (black nightshade) and several species
of _Hibiscus_. - Mod.DH]
