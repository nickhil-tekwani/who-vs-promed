A confirmed influenza-associated death has been reported in the Two Rivers Public Health Department District, which includes Dawson, Buffalo, Gosper, Phelps, Kearney, Harlan and Franklin counties [Nebraska].

According to a press release from Two Rivers, there is widespread flu activity across the state at this time. Outbreaks are occurring in schools, long-term care facilities, hospitals, clinics and workplaces. The health department did not release a name or city where the death occurred.

Influenza symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and dry cough. Officials at Two Rivers remind people to stay at home for at least 24 hours after they are fever free and haven't taken fever reducing medications in that time. They also suggest calling health care providers rather than visiting a clinic and potentially infecting others. The flu may be serious especially for the elderly, young children and those with compromised immune systems.

Two Rivers provides these tips for flu prevention:
1. Stay home when you are sick, especially if you have a fever.
2. Get vaccinated each year.
3. Cover your cough.
4. Wash your hands frequently using soap.
5. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
6. Practice other good health habits, such as getting plenty of sleep and exercise, managing your stress, drinking plenty of water and eating nutritious foods.

Two Rivers and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to recommend influenza vaccination for everyone ages 6 months and older. It takes approximately 2 weeks to receive immunity from influenza after getting the vaccine.

As of [5 Jan 2019] there were 1084 confirmed cases of influenza in the North Zone, the zone that includes the towns of Edson and Hinton and Jasper. A total of 133 people were hospitalized due to influenza, while there was one confirmed death due to the flu. In total, there were 89 677 people immunized in the North Zone.

The H1N1 strain, which became dominate in 2009, is the most prevalent type of flu in 2018-19, said Dr. Kathryn Koliaska, one of the medical officers of health for the North Zone.

The H1N1 strain has been a component in flu shots administered since 2009. Prior to 2009 it was not included in flu shots, but was added that year as a separate shot. As a result 2 flu shots were given to each adult in the fall of 2009. This year there are 4 different strains included in the current flu shots - two Influenza A and Two Influenza B strains, plus the H1N1 component.

"Our data is getting better and better," said Koliaska. "This helps to determine what kind of shot will be needed for the 2 hemispheres [northern and southern] and vice versa."

Flu strains around the earth are studied once data is compiled from the 2 hemispheres. Once that is accomplished the World Health Organization makes its best educated guess on what strains are to be included in each year's flu shot.

It had been thought that H1N1 originated in Mexico, Koliaska said. Flu seems to have started earlier this year than in 2017, she noted.

"[It seemed to be on the] upswing earlier [but] seems to be on the downswing slightly earlier," noted Koliaska. In 2014 and 2015 there was a 2nd rise of the pandemic, said Koliaska. She said health officials don't know whether the same trend will occur this year [2019].

Adults who get their flu shot may want a 2nd flu shot but the only ones who receive 2nd flu shots are children in the form of boosters, said Koliaska. This usually applies to children in their 1st year.

Koliaska recommends that people who have yet to have their flu shot get one. The shot will be available until the end of March. Shots can be administered at most drug store pharmacies and at the Edson Health Unit, the latter by appointment.

Japan's health ministry says an influenza outbreak is taking hold across the country. It estimates over 1.6 million people have been affected. The ministry reports that about 190.000 people were treated for flu symptoms at roughly 5000 medical institutions in the week through last [Sun 13 Jan 2018]. That is 110.000 more than the week before.

The figure works out to 38.5 patients per institution on average. The total number of flu patients is believed to have surpassed 1.63 million, jumping more than a million in a week. The ministry says the outbreak is worsening in most of Japan's prefectures, and warns that more people are bound to fall ill in the coming weeks. It says the virus subtype H1N1 is responsible for 70% of the cases. This is the same strain that caused a global pandemic a decade ago.

Officials are urging people, especially children and the elderly, to take preventive steps, such as hand-washing and wearing face masks.

[4] United Kingdom: Aussie flu

Aussie flu is a type of flu virus that mutated to form the deadly H3N2 viral strain. While it's similar to the more common flu strains, the symptoms tend to be worse and may last longer.

More than 430 people were hospitalised from Aussie flu infection last year [2017-2018], while almost 400 people died from flu over the course of the last flu season. It's now been revealed that a total of 18 people were admitted into hospital intensive care units last week due to Aussie flu infection, revealed latest Public Health England figures. That's the highest number of patients since the start of this year's flu season in October [2018].

[5] UK (Windsor-Essex): children flu cases

https://windsor.ctvnews.ca/children-account-for-43-of-windsor-essex-flu-cases-report-1.4259290


The number of children in Windsor-Essex who have been confirmed with influenza is higher than last flu season.

According to the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, children under 10 years of age account for 43% of documented flu cases in the region so far this year [2018-2019]. That is up 9% over last year [2017-2018].

Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Wajid Ahmed tells AM800 News flu season isn't close to over and cases are on the rise. He notes this year's strain is H1N1 and it's hard on children. "This particular strain is targeting young adults and young children," says Dr. Ahmed. "So people who haven't been vaccinated yet, our message is for them to get the vaccine."

Dr. Ahmed adds the vaccine is a good match with the circulating strain they have seen in the community. The Health Unit anticipates it will have more concrete influenza statistics in February [2019].

[6] USA: assessing baloxavir susceptibility of influenza viruses

The anti-influenza therapeutic baloxavir targets cap-dependent endonuclease activity of polymerase acidic (PA) protein. We monitored baloxavir susceptibility in the United States with next generation sequencing analysis supplemented by phenotypic one-cycle infection assay. Analysis of PA sequences of 6891 influenza A and B viruses collected during 2016/17 and 2017/18 seasons showed amino acid substitutions: I38L (2 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses), E23G (2 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses) and I38M (one A(H3N2) virus); conferring 4 10-fold reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.

The novel cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil was approved for the treatment of influenza virus infection in Japan in February 2018. Two influenza A(H3N2) viruses carrying an I38T substitution in the polymerase acidic subunit (PA) were detected in baloxavir-treated children in December 2018. This mutation is known to confer reduced susceptibility to baloxavir, and the 2 mutant viruses exhibited 76- and 120-fold reduced susceptibility to baloxavir.
