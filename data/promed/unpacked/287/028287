[Re: ProMED-mail Hepatitis B - USA: (WV) acute cases increase 20131007.1988954]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The number of cases of "acute" hepatitis B in West Virginia is noteworthy. Distinction from reactivation of chronic hepatitis B is sometimes difficult since patients with chronic hepatitis B often have 7S IgM anti-HBc (vs 19S) circulating in their blood prior to reactivation that is below the detection limit of the IgM-specific anti-HBc assay (which begins at a dilution of approximately 1:2000). When they undergo a reactivation of the disease, however, the IgM level increases and becomes detectable, the difference being that the IgM ratio (determined from the cutoff level of the assay and the value of the test sample), usually is low (ratio less than 3.5) in the patients with reactivation compared to acute infection where the titers are very high.

The age range and HBV genotype of the cases would be of interest since universal vaccination of newborn infants began in 1991 with adolescent recommendations following, although vaccination was available commercially beginning in 1982. It also might be of interest to determine if they had ever been vaccinated and at what age since durability of the vaccine begins to wane over time in persons vaccinated at birth (compared to those vaccinated at 6 months or later) and genotypes distinct from the HBsAg vaccine, which is made from genotype A, subgenotype A2 genomic material (subtype _adw2_), may have slightly lower efficacy against genotypes E and F and perhaps even other subgenotypes in which _ad_ strains are not being specified.
