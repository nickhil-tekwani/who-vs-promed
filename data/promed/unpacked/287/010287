The Plateau State Government has confirmed that the state has recorded 2 positive cases of monkeypox in Shendam Local Government Area of the state. Dr Kunden Deyin, the state commissioner for health, told the News Agency of Nigeria on [Thu 7 Jun 2018] in Jos that the 1st case recorded was imported from Port-Harcourt, as the victim came in from Rivers for treatment.

According to the commissioner, the infected victim eventually infected his brother and both of them were treated at the Bingham University Teaching Hospital in Jos and discharged. Deyin said that the state's Epidemiology and Surveillance unit of the ministry are still monitoring the contacts to curtail the spread of the disease.

The commissioner said that the symptoms of monkeypox were similar to that of chickenpox but more severe. He said that the disease is primarily transmitted from animal to man while the secondary source of transmission is through human to human contact. Deyin warned that people who kill, touch or cook bush animals, such as rats, squirrels and monkeys were at risk of contracting the disease as they serve as reservoirs of the virus. He cautioned the public to desist from indulging in such acts. Deyin also called on the public to report any sign of unexplained rashes to the nearest health facility.

He further disclosed that the number of suspected cases has risen from the initial 87 suspected cases on [Tue 5 Jun 2018] to 126 suspected cases. However, he assured that the ministry is working in collaboration with WHO, UNICEF, Médecins sans Frontières (MSF; Doctors Without Borders) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control to contain the disease.

The commissioner further cautioned the public to ensure that they practise handwashing and maintaining good hygiene as measures of preventing the disease. Besides, Deyin further cautioned that people should desist from eating uncooked vegetables, raw fish, street foods and ensure that they drink boiled water. He also called on the public to report cases of diarrhoea and vomiting to the nearest health facility.

The News Agency of Nigeria recalls that the state had recorded 5 confirmed cases, 3 deaths from symptoms similar to cholera and 87 cases.

[A 25 Feb 2018 report that summarized monkeypox cases as of that time indicated that there was a total of 228 suspected cases reported from 24 states and the federal capital territory [FCT]; 89 cases had been confirmed in 15 states, a total of 6 deaths had been recorded since the outbreak, 4 of which are in patients with background immunosuppression. A clustering of cases was found in Bayelsa, Rivers and Imo states but no evidence of epidemiological linkages across states had been demonstrated. Genetic sequencing suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into the human population.

The most recent extensive monkeypox (MPX) outbreak is the one in Nigeria, where as of late February 2018 there have been 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases in 14 states from September to December 2017. In addition, a 26 Mar 2018 report indicated that there were 2 suspected MPCX cases in Adamawa state with a cumulative case count of 6 with 1 death (https://reliefweb.int/report/nigeria/adamawa-state-integrated-disease-surveillance-and-response-idsr-nigeria-emergency-7). Now there are 2 additional cases, this time in Plateau state.

The question remains about the source of these recent infections within Nigeria and more recently in the Central African Republic. In Nigeria, infection of the index case for this outbreak was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing suggesting multiple sources of introduction of MPX virus into the human population, one wonders whether there is an MPXV epizootic going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in Nigeria. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
