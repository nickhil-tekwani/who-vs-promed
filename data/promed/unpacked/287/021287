Latest UK variant CJD figures and compensation scheme
-----------------------------------------------------
Coinciding with the publication of the latest figures on variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail in the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State for Health
announced details of the full compensation scheme that has been developed
to make payments to each of those who have had a diagnosis of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and their families (1,2). The compensation scheme
for United Kingdom victims of vCJD has been developed by the government in
consultation with representatives of families affected by vCJD. A new trust
will administer the compensation fund. An interim trust fund was set up in
April 2001, and interim payments of GBP 25 000 (USD 40 330) have already
been made to most of the families.
To Fri 28 Sep 2001, 101 deaths from vCJD have occurred in the United
Kingdom. This number includes 12 deaths of probable cases where
neuropathological confirmation will never be possible. The total number of
definite and probable cases is 107. There have been 120 referrals to the
CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh in 2001, of which 53 have been confirmed
including 16 cases of vCJD. In total 3 cases of vCJD were reported in 1995,
10 in 1996 and in 1997, 18 in 1998, 15 in 1999, and 28 in 2000.
The compensation scheme will provide for payments to be made in respect of
250 cases up to a maximum of GBP 55 million [USD 81 million plus. If the
number of cases turns out to exceed 250, an updated scheme would be put in
place.
In addition to the GBP 55 million trust fund, in recognition of the
exceptional circumstances, the British government will pay an additional
GBP 50 000 to each victim or their family. The government is making this
further commitment to a maximum of 250 cases. It is made to take account of
the legal and other difficulties the first families have had to encounter
and the additional pressures they have had to bear. Future claimants beyond
the first 250 cases will not be entitled to this additional payment.
