In reference to the meningoccemia outbreak in the Dominican Republic, has
the serotype been identified? What measures have been instituted in the
region to suppress further spread of the disease?

Benenson's latest "Control of Communicable Diseases in Man, 16th ed.
(1995) offers the following complete guidelines for the chemoprophylaxis
and specific treatment of meningococcal disease:
Chemoprophylaxis
----------------
The chemoprophylaxis of contacts depends on the sensitivity of the organism
to sulfadiazine. If sensitive, then sulfadiazine is the drug of choice.
However, this drug has not been manufactured in the USA since 1993 and
assistance from the CDC may be needed to obtain the drug. If the organism
is not sulfadiazine sensitive, then chemoprophylaxis with rifampin,
ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin may be useful.
Specific Treatment
------------------
For the treatment of proven meningococccal disease, parenteral penicillin is
the drug of choice and ampicillin and chloramphenical are also effective.
If the diagnosis is presumptive, then ampicillin is the drug of choice for
children (if the organism is ampicillin-sensitive) to provide protection
against Hib and S. pneumoniae. Patients with meningococcal disease should be
given rifampin prior to discharge to assure eliminatation of the organism.
