[This article written by Lucy CS LUM, helps explain the pulmonary edema
seen with EV-71. - MV]
Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE)
The association of pulmonary edema with CNS disease without underlying
cardiopulmonary disease is known as neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE). NPE
is characterized clinically by an often fulminant course marked by
pulmonary vascular congestion, protein rich edema fluid and intra-alveolar
hemorrhage.
The association between CNS injury and pulmonary edema was first reported
by Moutier in 1918; he observed the frequent occurrence of fatal acute
pulmonary edema after cerebral trauma from war injuries. Since then NPE has
been reported in a wide variety of CNS injuries such as raised intracranial
pressure, brain tumour, seizures, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid
hemorrhage, bulbar poliomyelitis, Guillain Barre and Reyes syndromes.
Several clinical and experimental observations point towards involvement of
the medulla in the pathogenesis of NPE. To date, only 3 reports relate NPE
in man to specific brainstem lesions:

a. Schlesinger. Neurogenic pulmonary edema due to puncture wound of the
medulla oblongata; J Nerv Ment Dis 102: 247-255, 1945.
b. Baker AB. Poliomyelitis. A study of pulmonary edema. Neurology
7:743-751,1957.
c. Brown RH et al. Medulla oblongata edema associated with neurogenic
pulmonary edema. J Neurosurgery 64:494-500, 1986.[MEDLINE abstract]
Baker's description is particularly interesting because EV71 and
polioviruses are enteroviruses. In his study of NPE following
poliomyelitis, Baker noted that only patients with pathologic changes in
the region of the dorsal nucleus of the vagus and the medial reticular
nuclei of the medulla developed NPE. The pathogenesis of NPE is not so well
defined but the physiologic changes have been described. Following an
insult to the brainstem, there appears to be an overwhelming outpouring of
catecholamines, especially noradrenalin. This produces peripheral
vasoconstriction followed by systemic hypertension and a shift of blood
from the high resistance systemic circulation to the relatively low
resistance pulmonary circulation. This elevation in hydrostatic pressure
damages the pulmonary capillaries with subsequent pulmonary hemorrhages.
Experimental data also point towards an increase in pulmonary capillary
permeability; thus the protein rich edema fluid. It is also shown in
clinical studies that the heart suffers a severe knock: myocardial necrosis
and echocardiographic evidence of severe cardiac dysfunction. It is the
latter that might be misinterpreted as myocarditis. It has been argued that
this may represent centrally mediated cardiac failure secondary to severe
increase in left ventricular afterload.
