Bird flu detected in cat as Thailand orders investigation into dead
cattle
-------------------------------------------------
Thailand on Thursday ordered an urgent probe into the deaths of
196 cattle over concerns they may have died from the bird flu
outbreak, as the deadly virus was reportedly discovered in a pet
cat.

If confirmed, the cat could be the first domesticated mammal to be
struck by the virus that has killed 22 people and ravaged poultry
stocks across Asia. A clouded leopard died of bird flu [in January
2004] in a zoo near Bangkok, the first mammal to be killed by the
virus besides humans that raised concerns about the virus jumping
species. The virus was discovered in the cat by researchers at the
Animal Hospital of Kasetsart University in Bangkok, the Krungthep
Thurakij daily newspaper said on its Web site, quoting the hospital's
director, Thanirat Santiwat.

"This could be the world's first bird flu case in a house cat,"
Thanirat was quoted as saying. He said the cat was brought to the
hospital from Nakhon Pathom province near Bangkok by its owner,
who reported that it had eaten dead chickens and had become sick.

The cattle died in early February 2004 near the mountains of
northeastern Kalasin province, 430 kilometers (270 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, Yukol Limlamthong, director general of the
Livestock Department, told reporters. "So far, we only know that the
cattle were local breeds and were roaming freely in the village," he
said.

However, Deputy Agriculture Minister Newin Chidchob said he did
not believe the animals were killed by the bird flu virus sweeping
Asia. "The cattle started dying 4 Feb 2004, and it is normal during
this time of year," he said. "Every year, those animals come down
from the hills to escape the cold. Some fall down and die and others
cannot tolerate the cool weather."

Newin said authorities would be unable to conduct lab tests for bird
flu from the cattle's carcasses because the animals had been
eaten by villagers or sent to slaughterhouses. Tests will instead be
done on the cattle's manure, said the chief veterinarian at the
Kalasil provincial livestock office, Prayat Leychiangsean.

The director of the Disease Control Division of the Livestock
Department, Dr. Nirundorn Auangtrakulsuk, said there was "no way
the animals had contracted bird flu," because cattle are too
genetically different from other species that have been infected. He
said the cattle likely died from foot & mouth disease, which has
been known to hit animals in Thailand, or a disease called
hemorragic septicemia, which causes swelling of the throat.

Commenting on the suspected jump of the disease to cattle, Dr.
Samuel Jutzi, director of Animal Production and Health Divisions at
the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization headquarters in
Rome, told The Associated Press that transmission of the virus
from one species to another "is not so easy." Still, he said he
would encourage Thai authorities to check symptoms and make
samples available for independent testing.

Bird flu has killed 7 people in Thailand and is known to have
sickened 2 other people, who have recovered. 15 people have also
died from the disease in Vietnam.

Another person has been added to the list of suspected human
cases, bringing the total number of people thought to have the
disease in Thailand to 21, 8 of whom have died and 8 of whom
have recovered.

[It is interesting to find this virus in a cat, but this virus has
been known to jump species before. It seems odd to find it in cattle,
however; foot and mouth disease does not necessarily kill the
animals. If there is authoritative information on the test results from
the dead cattle and the cat, ProMED-mail would appreciate
receiving that information. - Mod.TG]

The deadly strain of avian influenza hitting Asia has been found in 5
more birds that died at a zoo outside [Phnom Penh], a wildlife
expert said Thursday. The 5 fowl -- a crow, 2 eagles, a parakeet,
and an owl -- were among 59 wild birds that mysteriously dropped
dead at the Phnom Tamao zoo during January 2004. Earlier test
results for the 5 birds were negative for the H5N1 strain of bird flu,
but another round of tests turned out positive, said Matt Hunt, an
animal husbandry specialist with the U.S.-based conservation
group WildAid. He received the latest results on Tuesday.

A dead heron from the zoo had earlier tested positive for the H5N1
strain. WildAid is helping to care for rescued birds at the zoo, 45
kilometers south of Phnom Penh.

Pin Lyvun, the zoo's director, said no more birds have fallen sick
since 19 Jan 2004, when the last death took place. But the zoo's
bird section is still closed to the public to prevent human infection.
Cambodia is so far free of human cases of bird flu, said Sen
Sovann, a deputy director of the animal health department. But
authorities here are being cautious, because the virus has jumped
to humans in neighboring Viet Nam and Thailand, killing at least 22
people.

Sen Sovann said no new suspected cases in fowl have been
reported, but officials remain vigilant in monitoring the situation.
Cambodia has confirmed 3 outbreaks, all near Phnom Penh. More
than 25 000 chickens, ducks, and swans have been culled in
Cambodia in an effort to stop the disease from spreading.

3 previously suspected outbreaks of the H5N1 strain of bird flu
have been confirmed by the National Avian Influenza Reference
Laboratory, the Ministry of Agriculture announced Thursday. The
bird flu infected regions are Huanggang City of Hubei and
Chenzhou City of Hunan, 2 provinces in the south China area, and
Baicheng City in northeastern China's Jilin Province.

The local government has taken measures against the disease by
culling poultry in the affected areas and imposing prompt quarantine
restrictions, said the ministry.

At the same time, the reference laboratory excluded 3 previously
suspected outbreaks reported in Anning and Xigu districts and
Jingyuan County of Lanzhou City in northwestern China's Gansu
Province, according to the ministry.
