The President Prudente Regional Hospital [HR] announced this afternoon [12 Dec 2013] that meningococcal meningitis, caused by the bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_, caused the death of one of the OAS [construction company] employees, which had a work crew in the Regente Feijo area.

The diagnosis for the death of the other contractor has not yet been disclosed because the hospital is still awaiting test results to identify what killed this patient. The diagnosis was confirmed for the 24 year old worker hospitalized on 30 Nov [2013] who died on Monday [9 Dec 2013]. He and a 25 year old employee, who died on Tuesday [10 Dec 2013], were providing services to the dealership Auto Raposo Tavares (Cart).

According to the HR, the bacteria which caused the meningitis was identified by specific examination of the CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] of the dead worker. According to the hospital, the result of "highly sensitive" [tests] on the index case that were carried out by the Adolfo Lutz Institute was confirmed in the morning this Thursday [12 Dec 2013]. Until this Wednesday [11 Dec 2013], the Regional Hospital and the OAS had dismissed the possibility of meningitis.

The diagnosis was announced in the HR by the infectious disease physician Alexandre Portelinha Filho and by the coordinator of municipal epidemiological surveillance (Regente Feijo Epidemiological Surveillance; VEM), Vania Maria Alves Silva, at a press conference in the afternoon. "Meningitis was ruled out previously because the disease presentation was atypical. The tests on blood and CSF did not present findings commonly found in this disease; they were not suggestive [of meningitis]. Because of this, it seemed unlikely that this was a case of meningitis," stated Portelinha.

The infectious disease physician explained that the disease is transmitted through interpersonal relationships, that is, from person to person, through "saliva or nasopharyngeal droplets. [Transmission] depends on the proximity of the patient to other people," he stated.

The other patients who were interned in the HR and those who went to urgent care for attention have no relationship to the disease. "As was said yesterday [11 Dec 2013], they do not have a clinical picture compatible with that of the patient who died. These are different entities," he stated.

Vania Maria Alves Silva explained that VEM has now initiated chemoprophylaxis, that is, treatment with drugs for 2 days for people who had closest contact with the ill worker. "The work began in the housing area, with about 60 people. In reality, no one knows [the person who transmitted meningococcus to the patient who died of the disease]. So, this chemoprophylaxis will eradicate bacteria in the carrier to prevent a healthy person conveying it to another person," said the Coordinator of VEM Prudente. Portelinha emphasized that a person can be a carrier of the [bacteria] without developing symptoms.

Also according to the doctor, meningococcal meningitis is the "most feared for having a very fast development." The confirmation of a disease that had been ruled out before was a surprise for the hospital. "This atypical manifestation of the disease could have 2 explanations: the [particular strain] of meningococcus, or [susceptibility of] that person," said the infectious disease physician.

The HR now awaits the results for the other [dead] worker. "If it is a virus, the results can take 1-2 weeks, but for bacteria it is quick," stated Portelinha.

Also on the morning of Thursday [12 Dec 2013], health authorities and representatives of the contractor OAS had gathered behind closed doors in the Municipal Health Department of Presidente Prudente to discuss the matter. Among the participants of the meeting was the director of the Regional Health Department (DRS), Paulo Roberto Mazaro.

In an official statement, OAS [company] stated that since they have acknowledged the facts, "[they have] marshaled all efforts giving necessary support to affected employees by putting doctors on hand and dialoguing with all work teams to inform them correctly and calm them about the matter." The company claimed that it "deeply regrets the deaths of 2 of their workers recently admitted to hospital" and took the opportunity to announce that "the other 8 employees, who had also been admitted to hospital, were discharged already."

[The news release above fails to specify what exactly was "atypical" about the clinical presentation or to specify how the diagnosis of meningococcal disease was finally made in the man who died. Patients with acute meningococcal infection can present clinically with (1) meningitis, (2) meningitis with meningococcemia, or (3) meningococcemia without obvious meningitis. Did he have meningococcemia, an often dramatic, rapidly fatal blood stream infection associated with bleeding into the skin that causes a characteristic petechial rash, shock and multiorgan failure? Ischemic necrosis in the extremities may also occur that can necessitate amputation of digits or limbs.

Meningococcal disease is caused by a Gram negative diplococcus, _Neisseria meningitidis_. Meningococci are classified into serogroups on the basis of the composition of the capsular polysaccharide. At least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. At any time, 5-10 per cent of the population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of _N. meningitidis_. Person-to-person transmission occurs via respiratory secretions or saliva. Transmission is facilitated by close contact and crowded living conditions. Meningococcal disease occurs worldwide. In non-epidemic situations, invasive disease (that is, meningococcemia and meningitis) occurs at a rate of 0.5-10 cases per 100 000 population, and hundreds of cases per 100 000 population occur in epidemic situations (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm).

Photographs of lesions that accompany meningococcemia can be found at

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).

However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immunocompromised HIV infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017). In addition, individuals deficient in components of the alternative and terminal complement pathways are predisposed to invasive, often recurrent meningococcal infections. We don't know whether the worker who died of meningococcal disease had any condition predisposing to severe meningococcal disease.

Close contacts of patients with invasive meningococcal disease who are themselves at increased risk of acquiring the disease include household members, day care center contacts, and persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions (for example, through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or kissing). Chemoprophylaxis is given to these close contacts because their attack rate for secondary meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the general population
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm.

Rifampin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone are 90-95 per cent effective in reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitdis_ and are all acceptable antimicrobial agents for chemoprophylaxis. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

Presidente Prudente is a city with a population of 207 625 in 2010 in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil and located 558 km (346 miles) west of the city of Sao Paulo. - Mod.ML
