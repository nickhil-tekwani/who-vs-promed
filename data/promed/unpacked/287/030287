Canadian health officials have confirmed the 1st known fatal case of the H5N1 avian influenza strain in North America. Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose said the deceased person was an Alberta [province] resident who had recently travelled to Beijing. Calling the death an "isolated case," Ms Ambrose said the risk to the general population was low.

A total of 10 people have died in Alberta this season [2013-2014] from swine flu, or H1N1.

H5N1 infects the lower respiratory tract deep in the lung, where it can cause deadly pneumonia. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says it is difficult to transmit the virus from person to person but when people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 percent.

In the latest incident, the infected person 1st showed symptoms of the flu on an Air Canada flight from Beijing to Vancouver on [27 Dec 2013], officials said. The passenger continued on to Edmonton, and on [1 Jan 2014] was admitted to hospital where [the case] died 2 days later. Canadian federal health officials said they would not identify the patient's sex, age or occupation. Ms Ambrose said Canadian officials were working with Chinese authorities on the case. "The risk of getting H5N1 is very low. This is not the regular seasonal flu. This is an isolated case," she said.

According to the WHO, between 2003 and December 2013 there were 648 confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in 15 countries, leading to 384 deaths. Experts say that if the H5N1 virus were to mutate and become easily transmissible between humans, the consequences for public health could be very serious.

[2] Request for information

What lab methodology has been used other than PCR? Aside from a travel history, there is no epidemiologic risk factor such as exposure to live animal markets, based on what we are hearing. Is virus isolation being performed? Was immunohistochemistry on lung tissue performed on lung tissue? Did another lab confirm the PCR findings, which presumably are from a respiratory specimen? Was the CSF tested by PCR as well? More laboratory information would be most welcome, given the unprecedented nature of this case.

[This fatality is the 1st case of avian H5N1 influenza virus infection to have been recorded in North America, and undoubtedly the infection was contracted during a visit to Beijing. Many relevant details, such as the purpose of the visit, the sex of the victim, duration of residence in Beijing, exposure to live poultry, etc., have been withheld in order avoid unnecessary panic. So far there has been no evidence of transmission of infection to the victim's companions, relatives, fellow airline passengers, or medical staff. Human cases of avian H5N1 virus infection have been restricted to Middle Eastern and Asian countries with relatively few occurring in China. It is unlikely that the H5N1 infection will spread beyond this single fatality in Edmonton, Alberta, but until the Canadian authorities release more details of the diagnosis and characteristics of the virus obtained from the patient, that will remain uncertain for the present. - Mod.CP
