2005/075 Situation of several quarantine pests in Lithuania in
2004: 1st report of rhizomania

The NPPO of Lithuania has informed the EPPO Secretariat of the
results of national surveys conducted in 2004 on several quarantine
pests. Results of earlier surveys were presented in EPPO RS 2004/078.

Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus (rhizomania - EPPO A2 list)
----------------------
In October 2004, rhizomania was recorded in the Sakai district. A
sugarbeet field of 84 ha was found infected. The EPPO Secretariat had
previously no data on the occurrence of rhizomania in Lithuania.
After harvest, agricultural machinery used on the infected field was
thoroughly cleaned. Sugarbeets were processed only at the end of the
factory work. The factory installations were then also disinfected.
Plant wastes were buried and used waters were treated. Washed soil
will not be used for agricultural purposes. For 2005, the grower
concerned was advised to grow resistant sugarbeet cultivars, to
choose fields isolated as much as possible from the infected field,
and not to use the infected field for any root vegetable. Present,
first found in 2004 in the district of Sakiai (1 field), under
official control.

[Rhizomania is a disease of beet _(Beta vulgaris_ subsp. _vulgaris_)
caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV). The disease is
most serious on sugar beet, although it is also known to infest
fodder beet, red beet, spinach beet, seakale beet, swiss chard and
spinach (_Spinacea oleracea_). If left unchecked, there are
significant reductions in sugar beet yields through reductions in
root weight and accompanying reduction in sugar content. 3 different
pathotypes (strains) of the virus have been identified, the 'A', 'B'
and 'P' pathotypes. Sugar beet cultivars have been developed that are
both tolerant and show some resistance to infection. - Mod.DH]

_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] (EPPO A2 list)
-----------------------
In 2004, 31 samples of ware potatoes (corresponding to 525.80 tons
and 15 farms) were found infected by _C. michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_. Of these 15 farms, 5 had been found infected
previously. Infected potatoes were used for animal feed or
processing. Potato cultivation was prohibited for at least 3 years in
infected fields. Present, found in a few areas (15 farms), under
official control.

[Cms is a major constraint to potato production worldwide. Management
of the disease requires that only certified disease-free seed tubers
be planted. In Canada and the U.S., there is a zero tolerance for
Cms. Planting of infected seed is to be discontinued. Before handling
seed tubers, all containers, tools, knives and mechanical cutters,
planters, and other equipment should be thoroughly washed with a
detergent solution, rinsed, and then sanitized with a disinfectant.
If Cms is confirmed to be present, a thorough cleanup must be
undertaken. All infected tubers should be disposed of away from
potato production areas. All surfaces of storage and equipment must
be freed of all mud, dirt and debris and then washed with a strong
detergent in hot water applied by a high-pressure washer. After
cleaning, all storage facilities and equipment must be treated with a
disinfectant. Farmers must not plant potatoes for 2 seasons in any
field in which ring rot has been found. -Mod.DH]

_Ditylenchus destructor_ (EU Annexes)
------------------
The nematode (Potato rot nematode) was detected in 33 samples of seed
potatoes (corresponding to 942.4 tons and 8 farms) and in 48 samples
of ware potatoes (894.5 tons, 26 farms). Some of the infected
potatoes were used for animal feed or processing, and the rest were
destroyed. A crop rotation will be established. Present, found in a
few areas (34 farms), under official control.

[The potato rot nematode (PRN) has been reported in areas of Idaho,
California and Wisconsin. PRN has also found in widespread areas in
many potato-growing areas in Europe and the Russia, in some areas of
South America, South Africa and the Mediterranean region. PRN cannot
be eradicated from any cropland with any conventional farm chemical
or management practice, but sanitation and some management practices
help prevent the nematode's further spread. Only certified potato
seed that originated from a limited generation program is to be
planted; year-out or eliminator plants should not be planted.
Resistance among recently released potato cultivars has not been
determined, but all older cultivars are considered susceptible. Do
not store potatoes if PRN is detected during harvest, because the
nematode can grow and develop under normal storage conditions.
Potatoes must not be planted in infested fields for 4 to 6 years and
a cereals and grasses rotation is suggested for inclusion in the scheme.

All contaminated storage facilities, and cultivation and handling
equipment that have come in contact with contaminated potatoes must
be disinfected. Infested soil or potatoes on cropland must be
properly disposed of and fields should be free of weeds. Application
of approved nematicides according to label recommendations is
presently the best management method for reducing PRN populations in
the soil. - Mod.DH]

_Globodera rostochiensis_ [Gr] (EPPO A2 list)
-------------------
101 farms were found infested by _G. rostochiensis_ (Potato cyst
nematode, PCN), covering an area of approximately 261 ha. 168 ha were
intended for ware potatoes (corresponding to 25 farms), 54 ha for
seed potatoes (3 farms), and 39 ha for fruit tree orchards and
ornamental nurseries (73 farms). Cultivation of potatoes and other
plants for planting was prohibited in all infested plots. Present,
found in a few areas (101 outbreaks), under official control.

[Cysts of the Potato cyst nematode (PCN) persist in soil for more
than 10 years. Second-stage juveniles (J2) emerge from the cysts,
penetrate host roots and establish a specialized feeding site
(syncytium, a large region of cytoplasm that contains many nuclei) in
the stele. The nematode is present in at least 56 countries. In the
US, the golden nematode occurs in New York State (Long Island and
Steuben County, Upstate New York). The nematode was also introduced
in Delaware (Newcastle county), where it was eradicated. The spread
of the nematode is restricted in the state of New York by quarantine
actions including nematode surveys, application of nematicides and
the use of resistant varieties. Its main host is potato (_Solanum
tuberosum_) but other species include oca (_Oxalis tuberosa_),
jimsonweed (_Datura stramonium_), tomato (_Lycopersicon_ spp.), and
_Salpiglossis_ spp. Under poor nematode management, crop losses
induced by the PCN range from 20-70 percent. Presence of the PCN in
potato growing-areas preclude the export of potatoes to international
markets due to the restrictions imposed by many countries against
this pest. Nematodes are dispersed with soil debris and plant
material contaminated by the cysts and by infected or contaminated
potato tubers. Because of yield losses and adverse regulatory impact
caused by this nematode, the risk posed by this pest to the United
States is very high. Quarantine actions are already implemented by
APHIS against PCN. - Mod.DH]

Plum pox potyvirus (PPV - EPPO A2 list)
-------------------
In August/September 2004, 3 outbreaks of PPV were detected in the
districts of Kaunas and Telsiai. 1 was found in a breeding station
and 2 in orchards. All infected trees will be destroyed. Present,
found in a few areas (3 outbreaks), under eradication.

[PPV, the cause of the most destructive and most feared viral disease
of _Prunus_, (plum pox or Sharka) is now well established in North
America. PPV strains can infect peaches, plums, apricots, nectarines,
almonds, sweet and sour cherries, as well as other selected _Prunus_
and non-_Prunus_ species. More than 20 aphid species transmit in a
stylet-borne manner, the virus is also spread by movement of nursery
stock, budwood, and grafting. There is no cure or treatment for the
disease once a tree becomes infected. Infected trees must be
destroyed so as to eradicate inoculum sources. 4 PPV strains transmit
PPV: PPV-D, PPV-M, PPV-EA, and PPV-C. PPV-M isolates are more
aggressive in peach, are aphid-vectored more efficiently, and spread
more rapidly in an orchard. PPV-M has been reported to be
seed-transmitted, while other PPV strains are not known to be
transmitted through seeds. Both PPV strains M and D infect peach,
plum, and apricot. PPV-C infects sweet and tart cherry naturally, and
has infected other Prunus hosts experimentally. To date, no other PPV
strains have been reported to infect cherry naturally. The strain
present in Pennsylvania has been determined to be PPV-D.

Scientists use several techniques to distinguish PPV strains,
including serological test such as ELISA and molecular test such as
polymerase chain reactions (PCR). They also sequence the PCR products
or cut the PCR products with enzymes at locations in the DNA sequence
that are unique to each strain. In established orchards, Once the
disease becomes established in an orchard, control and prevention
measures for plum pox include field surveys, use of certified nursery
materials, control of aphids, and elimination of infected trees in
nurseries and orchards. Sources of resistance exist in _Prunus_, but
are not abundant. Collaborative research between scientists from the
United States and France has genetically engineered a PPV-resistant
plum (otherwise known as C5), and the resistance can be transferred
through hybridization to other plum trees. This provides a unique
source of germplasm for future breeding programs worldwide. There has
been no similar success in the attempt to genetically modify other
_Prunus_ spp., although these efforts are ongoing. - Mod.DH]
