Abstract
-----------
We describe 2 cases of human infections caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ clonal complex (CC) 75, also called _Staphylococcus argenteus_, harbouring the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL). These 2 sporadic cases were community-acquired, and identified in France in 2014. Both had an epidemiological link with Mayotte, an overseas department of France located in the Indian Ocean off the south-eastern African coast. This report illustrates that, contrary to previous descriptions, _S. argenteus_ can acquire important virulence factors and be responsible for severe infections.

In 2014, 2 cases of human infections caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates belonging to clonal complex (CC) 75 lineage, also called _Staphylococcus argenteus_, harbouring the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) occurred in France. The 2 cases were sporadic and community-acquired, and had an epidemiological link with Mayotte, a French archipelago in the Indian Ocean. The 2 strains affecting the respective cases were both isolated from blood culture.

Case description
---------------------
Case 1
In January 2014, a French woman of Comorian origin in her mid-20s presented to the Emergency Department of a hospital in Lyon, with an 8-day history of deterioration of the general condition, chills and cough complicated by haemoptysis starting the day before. The symptoms had appeared 3 weeks after the excision of a recurrent abscess in the left thigh for which the patient had initially received oral treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid during five days, then roxithromycin during the following 8 days. Interview of the patient revealed a travel to Mayotte 6 months earlier. The patient was immediately admitted to hospital. At that time, she presented with cough, haemoptysis and chest pain. Body temperature was high at 39.1 C and heart rate was 119/min. Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 17.4 x 109/L (norm: 4-10.5 x 109/L), a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 251 mg/L (norm: under 3 mg/L), and abnormal liver function tests (alanine and aspartate transaminases, alkaline phosphatase and gammaglutamyl transpeptidase were all elevated). A chest radiography revealed a bilateral abscessed pneumonia with right pleural effusion. Blood cultures were immediately initiated but no pulmonary sample was taken prior to antibiotherapy at the hospital. Treatment was started with ceftriaxone-spiramycin on the same day. The next day, blood culture was positive with _S. aureus_. As the strain was susceptible to meticillin [methicillin] and positive for Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), treatment was changed to intravenous oxacillin and clindamycin per os. After initiation of this treatment, fever disappeared in only 1 day while haemoptysis persisted for 7 days. No other pathogen was identified. After 21 days, treatment was stopped due to a drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome and replaced by linezolid up to a total duration of 5 weeks. _S. aureus_ decolonisation was performed during hospitalisation to eradicate nasal carriage and to prevent recurrences.

Case 2
In November 2014, an 18-month-old child living in Mayotte presented at a dispensary with a 3-day history of fever and right lower limb pain. They were referred to the hospital Emergency Department of Mamoudzou. At the time of admission, the clinical examination led to suspect arthritis of the right knee with a skin lesion in front and inflammatory extension to the rest of the leg. Body temperature was 39.8â€‰C and heart rate 193/min. Laboratory findings showed a white blood cell count of 13.4 x 109/L and a CRP of 229 mg/L. Ultrasound revealed joint effusion which could not be punctured. Blood cultures were immediately collected and treatment started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and gentamicin intravenously. The next day, the child was transferred to the intensive care unit due to worsening tachycardia and cold extremities despite the infusion of a volume expander. Blood culture was positive with _S. aureus_ susceptible to methicillin. Based on suspicion of a toxin-mediated infection, treatment was changed to clindamycin, gentamicin, linezolid and polyvalent immunoglobulins intravenously. Blood culture became negative 48 hours after the initiation of antibiotherapy. 3 days after admission, ultrasound showed joint effusion of the right knee associated with a collection at the quadriceps bursa. Culture from pus aspiration yielded an _S. aureus_ isolate susceptible to methicillin. The _S. aureus_ isolate was positive for PVL by PCR. Treatment was continued intravenously with oxacillin and clindamycin. Multiple pulmonary abscesses appeared on the 10th day, which led to change treatment for clindamycin-rifampicin [rifampin] and finally for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid-rifampicin orally for a total of 6 weeks, allowing the patient's recovery.

Analysis of strains
---------
Blood cultures from the 2 patients yielded _S. aureus_ isolates, which were sent to the French national reference centre for staphylococci in Lyon for characterisation.

The 2 strains were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (Maldi-Tof) mass spectrometry as _S. aureus_. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion assay or on automated Vitek2 system and interpreted according to the 2013 guidelines of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society for Microbiology (CA-SFM). The following panel of antibiotics was tested: penicillin, oxacillin or cefoxitin, kanamycin, tobramycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, clindamycin or lincomycin, pristinamycin, levofloxacin or ofloxacin, tetracycline, rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, fusidic acid, fosfomycin, linezolid, teicoplanin, and vancomycin. The 2 isolates were susceptible to meticillin and to all the antibiotics tested except penicillin.

Further characterisation of the strains with the DNA microarray Identibac _S. aureus_ Genotyping (Alere Technologies, Jena, Germany) for staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec typing and toxin profiling [1] revealed that the 2 strains harboured the PVL genes and belonged to the _S. argenteus_ lineage sequence type (ST) 2250/2277. This was confirmed by PVL PCR and by assignment by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) to ST2250 using specific primers for aroE [2]. Alignment of the 7 MLST gene sequences from the patients' respective strains to those of _S. argenteus_, and neighbour-joining phylogenetic analysis showed that the 2 strains belonged to the _S. argenteus_ lineage. Moreover, after 48 hours of growth, the 2 strains presented a lack of pigmentation typical of _S. argenteus_ [3].

Discussion
--------------
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the 1st observation of _S. argenteus_ lineage isolates harbouring the PVL genes. _S. argenteus_ has recently been described as a novel species in the genus _Staphylococcus_, and is - as _S. schweitzeri_ is - part of an _S. aureus_ species complex [1]. Several studies previously described the CC75 lineage as grouping clones of _S. aureus_ belonging to STs that are very distant from all other clones and characterised by the lack of staphyloxanthin (e.g. ST75, ST850, ST883, ST1223, ST1304, ST1850) [2-5]. Such strains were isolated mainly from indigenous populations in Australia and French Guyana [2,4,6], but also in Cambodia, Fiji, Trinidad and Tobago, Thailand [7-10] and from animals in Africa [11,12]. No strain harbouring the PVL was described among these isolates, which were considered as having an attenuated virulence compared with other _S. aureus_ strains [5,13,14].

By conferring cytotoxicity on neutrophils and monocytes-macrophages, PVL leads to a high degree of virulence [15]. PVL-positive strains are most frequently responsible for skin and soft-tissue infections, but can also cause severe necrotising pneumonia or aggressive bone and joint infections [16]. The present results indicate that some strains belonging to the _S. argenteus_ lineage are able to acquire the PVL phage. Moreover, the severity of the clinical presentation of the 2 cases described in this report strongly suggests an important role of PVL in their infections.

Both cases described had a link to Mayotte, which indicates the potential geographical origin of these isolates there. Enhanced surveillance is therefore necessary to determine whether PVL-positive _S. argenteus_ lineage might emerge as a cause of infections in Mayotte and might disseminate further in France and in other countries.

[The above report describes 2 patients infected with Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive, methicillin-susceptible organisms that were also susceptible to all the antimicrobial agents tested, except penicillin. The 2 strains were also found to belong to _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA) clonal complex (cc)75 that lacks the genes for production of staphyloxanthin, the carotenoid pigment that confers upon colonies of _S. aureus_ its characteristic golden color. These organisms form part of a _S. aureus_ related complex, but are sufficiently genetically divergent from _S. aureus_ to be designated a separate species, _Staphylococcus argenteus_ (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/early/2014/09/30/ijs.0.062752-0).

Both patients had a link to Mayotte, an archipelago with a population of 212 645 people, located in the northern Mozambique Channel in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Southeast Africa, between northwestern Madagascar and northeastern Mozambique (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayotte). It is an overseas department and region of France.

PVL is an exotoxin produced by some strains of _Staphylococcus aureus_ that induces lysis of host phagocytic blood cells, thus impairing host response and predisposing to severe skin and soft-tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. The genes encoding PVL can spread from strain to strain by bacteriophages. PVL has been strongly linked epidemiologically to prevalent community-acquired, methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (CA-MRSA) strains, which carry staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) types IV or V and are usually sensitive to multiple classes of antibiotics. PVL is usually not present in healthcare-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA), which are multidrug resistant and carry SCC types I, II, or III (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1829128/). (SCC carry the mecA gene that encodes for resistance to methicillin. The SCC found in HA-MRSA carry, in addition to the mecA gene, genes that encode resistance to multiple non-beta-lactam classes of antimicrobials.)

Although commonly associated with CA-MRSA, PVL is also present in MSSA. In fact, historical MSSA isolates that were pandemic in the 1950s and 1960s harbored PVL genes (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/2/480.long). More recently, PVL-positive MSSA strains have been associated with outbreaks of skin infections (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2657610/). - Mod.ML
