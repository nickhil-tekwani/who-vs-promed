A 14 year old girl died of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the Municipality
of
Aracatuba, in the State of Sao Paulo. This is the first death of this
disease in the state. She was being treated as leukemic for one year, and VL
was found one week ago.
739 dogs in about 10 000 in the city are positive, there are no vehicles to
transport dogs to be killed, and there are positive dogs in 13 nearby
cities,
within a radius of 50 km.

[Dogs are the reservoir of VL, caused by protozoan parasites of the genus
_Leishmania_ transmitted by sandflies (phlebotomines). Some of the symptoms
are lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes), leukopenia, a lowering
of the white cell count in the blood, & anemia, lowering of the red cell
count, a combination which in some cases might mimic leukemia, which is a
cancerous proliferation of the white cells. It is not clear whether the
child was misdiagnosed for one year, or whether the leukemia treatment
contributed to the VL infection spreading throughout her body. In any
event, this case should alert physicians to look for alternative diagnoses
to chronic blood count abnormalities - Mod.JW
