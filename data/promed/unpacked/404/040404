[Note: We received this report from many of our loyal and helpful readers,
including
Andrew Tucker, Clyde Markon, Angie Lee, and Chan Yow Cheong. A more
definitive report follows the one below and is from Julie Rawlings, Texas
State Department of Health. - Mod.CHC
A dengue fever outbreak in Texas has grown to 36 confirmed cases, the most
in the state this decade. While the viral illness is not rare in the
United States, most cases are contracted in other countries. Health
officials said 11 cases in this outbreak are believed to have been
contracted in Texas.
Texas Department of Health epidemiologist Julie Rawlings said dengue is
common in the state because the climate near the Mexican border is
conducive to breeding mosquitoes. Also, many residents travel frequently to
Mexico, which has seen thousands of cases this year. "The potential for
bringing the virus into Texas is greater than other states," she said.
The largest outbreak of dengue in Texas was in 1980, when 63 cases were
reported. In a 1995 outbreak, 29 cases were reported.
Unseasonably warm weather has allowed more mosquitoes to breed. Cities and
counties are advising residents to wear insect repellant and long sleeves
and pants to avoid being bitten and to empty water containers such as pet
water dishes that are kept outdoors.

[I wouldn't say, and Julie Rawlings likely did not say, that dengue is
"common" in Texas. I do agree with the media report suggesting than people
should wear pants. - Mod.CHC

Thirty-nine cases of dengue have been confirmed in Texas since 1 Jul 1999.
Twenty-five cases were in Webb County residents. The remaining fourteen
cases were in residents of Cameron (3), Dallas, Galveston, Hidalgo (2),
Nueces, Starr, Tarrant, Travis (2), and Willacy (2) Counties.
Thirteen of these cases (seven in Webb County residents, two in Cameron
County residents, and one each in Dallas, Nueces, Starr, and Willacy County
residents) were acquired in Texas. The Nueces County resident had traveled
to Webb County, but not outside the US during the two weeks prior to onset
of illness. The Dallas County resident had traveled to Cameron County, but
not outside the US during the two weeks prior to onset of illness.
The remaining patients, except for the Tarrant County resident who traveled
to Brazil, all had been in Mexico during the two weeks prior to onset of
illness.
The latest illness onset date for locally acquired cases: 26 October;
latest onset for persons who traveled during the two weeks prior to onset
of symptoms: 4 November.
