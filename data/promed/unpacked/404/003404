Foot and mouth disease detected in north Malaysian
----------------------
22 head of cattle had so far been found to have foot and mouth disease
(FMD) in the northern state of Terengganu, Malaysia National News Agency
reported Monday.
Terengganu Director of Veterinary Services Azizol Mohd Sharum was quoted by
the agency on Monday as saying that 63 percent of the nearly 2000 head of
cattle in the infected areas had been vaccinated over the last 4 days.
The veterinary officials striving to check the spread of the FMD among
cattle in Terengganu seized 3 cows at the Gong Badak slaughterhouse after
the house owner failed to produce a permit for the movement of cattle. The
movement of cattle has been restricted in the state since the disease was
detected there 4 days ago.
"We are viewing this case seriously, for in the present situation, actions
such as this can cause more cows to be infected," the director said.
Azizol said the Veterinary Services Department was concerned that the cows
could be from infected areas and investigations were still on.
"We hope farmers and cattle dealers will play their role to prevent the
disease from spreading, as the veterinary officials already have their
hands full," he said.
Azizol said action would be taken under the law against any farmer or
cattle dealer moving livestock without a permit.
Anyone bringing in the infected cow from the disease-stricken areas can be
punished under the Animal Ordinance 1952, which provides a fine of 5000
ringgit (USD 1315) and seizure of the prohibited item.
