[1] Cholera - India (New Delhi)

It is the time of cholera in the city and the cases have shot up way
above 700. As compared to 2006, when until the month of July there
were 569 cases of cholera reported, in 2007 the number has jumped to
719.
"The frequent rain this year [2007], even before the arrival of
monsoon, has led to greater water contamination. Besides, in the
monsoon season high humidity makes the environment more disease
prone. Rainwater especially, ends up contaminating the water in hand
pumps. Lack of personal hygiene is also to blame," said municipal
health officer NK Yadav.
In 2006, a total of 1085 cases were reported by the end of the year
and 176 cases were reported in the month of July 2006. In 2007, close
to 100 cases have already been reported in July.
It had been expected that the figures would go down in 2007, as there
was more potable water available from the Sonia Vihar water
treatment plant. "The amount of potable water we had expected wasn't
made available in the end due to certain reasons. This added to the
problem," said Yadav.

[2] Cholera, El Tor - India (Mumbai)
Date: Mon 16 Jul 2007

<http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?NewsID=1110097>

For the 1st time this monsoon [2007], the Brihanmumbai Municipal
Corporation (BMC) hospitals have shifted at least 15 patients from
different hospitals to one civic hospital citing "medical reasons".
BMC's executive health officer Jairaj Thanekar admitted that it is El
Tor cholera, but not "classic cholera". His comment was in response
to a query when this paper asked why there is a sudden need to
isolate some patients. (The El Tor form tends to be milder in nature,
while the classic is more often fatal.)
The 15 patients, most of who are from Antop Hills, were moved to
Kasturba Gandhi Hospital at Mahalaxmi from the KEM (King Edward
Memorial), Nair, and Sion hospitals over the last 7 days. The
decision to isolate 15 patients has created a panic though the civic
authorities vehemently denied any outbreak of monsoon-related
diseases.
The 15 patients are now being monitored in Kasturba Hospital, which
has a special ward for diarrhea cases. Interestingly, the BMC termed
the disease "extreme gastroenteritis" or extreme "diarrhea".
"As of now, we have been told there are only cases of gastroenteritis
and diarrhea, but not cholera," added Dr Suhas Ranade, Assistant
Director, Directorate of Health Services (DHS).
Thanekar also added that 70 percent of the "mild cholera patients"
have already been discharged. "These are not cases of classic cholera
so there is nothing to panic," he added. "Figures are not with me."

[The flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many
water vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing strains
causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do
distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serotypes. Almost
all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the
emergence of the Bengal strain (which is "non-O1"), a single
serotype, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.
However, there are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and
Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor
phenotype.

<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/505c6b25abdf174dc785827be2deb3ee.htm>

Health bodies and UN agencies in Nepal have taken emergency measures
in the capital, Katmandu, and elsewhere to control a cholera outbreak
1st reported last week [9-15 Jul 2007].
Diarrheal diseases are endemic in the country but this monsoon season
[2007] Katmandu had a record 223 cases of cholera, according to the
Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EPCD) of the Department of
Health.
Acute gastroenteritis, also known as acute watery diarrhea, has
already claimed 5 lives, and there are over 3700 cases, the EPCD, a
government agency charged with managing outbreaks and public health
emergencies, said. "The problem became worse this year [2007] due to
severe water pollution," Manas Kumar Banerjee, director of EPCD, told
IRIN on 18 Jul 2007. Banerjee said water quality in Katmandu was very
low and much of the drinking water was polluted.
In April 2007, 28 percent of the city's drinking water was unsafe to
drink. By July 2007, it had worsened to a dangerously high level of
72 percent.

The [number of] patients with cholera and gastroenteritis has gone up
at and around the areas of Lalitpur sub-metropolis, said District
Public Health Office, Lalitpur. Around 62 out of 508 patients of
diarrhea visiting hospital between 15 Jun and 10 Jul 2007 have been
detected with cholera, said Senior Public Health Officer Rishi Prasad
Lamichhane.
The Public Health Office has launched a special program following the
rise [in the number] of patients of cholera and diarrhea at and
around the sub-metropolis area. The office has taken initiatives to
examine the quality of drinking water, to create awareness among
people, and to dispatch medicines to the respective health posts at
the area, informed Lamichhane.
Likewise, the office is set to launch a massive public awareness
program on how to prevent epidemics of cholera in the area, in
coordination with the sub-metropolis, local social organisations, and
the District Education Office. The office has started the task of
examining and purifying water at stone spouts and wells, the main
sources of drinking water at the area.

A teenager has died and 7 others have fallen seriously ill due to an
outbreak of cholera in a [remote] village in the northern part of
Dolakha district over the week.
The 13-year-old girl, a resident of Sungure in Lapelang VDC-9, passed
away Friday morning [20 Jul 2007], while undergoing treatment at the
village.
According to a health worker Jagat Bahadur Khadka, 3 patients in
serious condition have been referred to the district headquarters
after they were treated in the village. Khadka also said the patients
apparently were suffering from cholera, as they showed no sign of
improvement even after administering medicines and saline water
throughout the night.
According to [the Kantipur] correspondent, an entire locality in the
village has been affected following the outbreak of gastroenteritis.
The District Health Office has informed that a team of health workers
and some medicines have been dispatched to the affected village.

A total of 4 children have now died in an outbreak of diarrhea in
Tangerang regency, which has affected 5 districts. The head of the
communicable diseases prevention unit at the regency's health agency,
Yuliah Iskandar, said Mon 16 Jul 2007, that 2 children in Lebak Wangi
village and another in Sarakan village, both in Sepatan district, had
died of dehydration over the weekend [14-15 Jul 2007]. The 1st death
was of a 2-year-old girl on Thu 12 Jul 2007, after being treated at a
health clinic for several hours.
According to the agency, 487 people, mostly children, have been
treated for diarrhea at public health clinics in Sepatan, Kedaung
Barat, and Pakuhaji districts. The overwhelmed clinics have been
forced to set up tents to accommodate all of the patients.
While Regent Ismet Iskandar earlier blamed residents and their lack
of understanding of proper sanitation for the outbreak, Yuliah said
the outbreak was not caused by contaminated water used in their
homes. "We have examined water taken from the residents' wells and it
is free from the _E. coli_ and _Vibrio cholerae_ bacteria that have
caused the outbreak," she said.
Patients interviewed by health agency officials, she said, consumed
snacks and iced syrup beverages purchased from street vendors before
falling ill. "We have sent a sample of the syrup for laboratory tests
and we will announce the results as soon as possible," Yuliah said.
The outbreak began early last week [8-14 Jul 2007] in Sepatan
district, spreading to Sepatan Timur, Pakuhaji, Rajeg, and Sukadiri
districts. The Tangerang regency administration has declared the
diarrhea outbreak an "extraordinary occurrence" in the 5 districts.
In June 2005, a similar outbreak affected more than 1000 people,
killing 19.

[7] Diarrhea, cholera - Iraq

Iraqi Health Ministry officials warned on 3 Jul 2007 of a possible
increase in waterborne diseases among children and the elderly during
the summer's hottest month of July 2007.
Water and sewage networks have not been repaired and this could
exacerbate the problem, which has been further highlighted by 5
cholera cases recently reported in southern Iraq, the officials said
[previously posted by ProMED-mail, Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery
update 2007 (22) 20070615.1959 - Mod.LL].
"Many cases of viral hepatitis, diarrhea, typhoid, and bacterial
infections have been registered in Baghdad due to polluted drinking
water," Ahmed Assad Naji of Baghdad's health directorate said.
"Water is an enormous need, and people take it where they can get it,
and they are getting it from places where it is not always clean. The
deteriorated security situation has made it very hard to repair the
country's sewage and water networks to work properly and that caused
these waterborne diseases," Naji said.
"The number of cases in Iraq is still small; none has been fatal and
all of them are still under control. Nevertheless the cases could
reach serious levels if immediate measures are not taken to repair
sewage and water networks," he added. Naji also said the most
vulnerable persons for these diseases were children under 5, women
aged 19-45, and elderly people. Precise figures for the number of
people, especially children, affected by waterborne diseases in Iraq
are not available.
In late June 2007, 5 cases of cholera were reported among children in
the southern city of Najaf, about 200 km (124.3 mi) south of Baghdad,
said Nasser Mohammed Ali of the city's health directorate. "All of
the cases were among children under 12," Ali added.

On the afternoon of 19 Jun 2007, Guandong Provincial Health Bureau
announced that Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau reported 2 confirmed
cases of cholera in Guangzhou's Liwan District on 16 and 17 Jun 2007.
An investigation showed that both patients serve as nannies in a
Liwan District household. On 13 Jun 2007, they developed low-grade
fever, diarrhea, and other symptoms. Lab analysis was positive for
_Vibrio cholerae_ (Inaba type). Prior to becoming ill, the patients
had eaten blue crab, freshwater prawns, and other food. There is a
high likelihood that food was the source of infection.

Cholera has broken out in the Manyatta settlement of Kisumu District.
Reports by the Kisumu East Ministry of Health (MoH) office on 12 Jul
2007, stated that there was a cholera outbreak currently being
experienced in the area. According to the District Health Management
Team (DHMT), 4 cases were admitted at the New Nyanza Provincial
Hospital on 11 Jul 2007. One of the affected people was discharged
while the other 3 are currently recuperating and are in stable
condition.
A rapid assessment team dispatched by the Kenya Red Cross Society's
Kisumu Branch and the MoH, has visited the affected area and
collected rectal swabs from 6 people who reported to have experienced
diarrhea more than 3 times on 12 Jul 2007. The team has also sampled
the water from households and water wells, which are common water
sources in the area. The specimens collected from the affected people
have been taken to New Nyanza General Hospital for analysis.

[10] Diarrhea - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland West)

A diarrhea outbreak has claimed the lives of 29 children and 5 adults
in the last 2 weeks in Zimbabwe, which has been experiencing water
shortages as a result of frequent disruptions of supplies, according
to a UN official.
"The problem (diarrhea outbreak) is related to the water pumping
capacity in the affected areas, and we are aware that it is something
that can happen again and again," said James Elder, spokesman for the
United Nations Children's Agency (UNICEF) in Zimbabwe. Most of the
deaths have occurred in Kadoma, a mining town in Mashonaland West
Province in the north.
"We are taking the situation seriously and we are on the ground,
together with WHO and the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. We
have managed to contain the outbreak, but we will continue monitoring
the situation so that lives are not lost again," he added.
Last week [2-8 Jul 2007], the official daily newspaper, The Herald,
quoted Wenselaus Nyamayaro, a provincial medical director, as saying
that 20 people had died in the mining town of Kadoma, which has a
population of about 80 000 people.
A resident who lives in the populous, poor suburb of Rimuka in
Kadoma, said deaths resulting from suspected diarrhea and cholera
were "something we live with every week. For years, we have seen many
people die because of the unhygienic conditions under which we live.
There are several sections of the suburb that have gone without water
for more than 8 months, and residents are forced to use the bucket
system when relieving themselves, thereby getting exposed to
communicable diseases."

shigellosis [a disease caused by the bacterium _Shigella_.
It can be treated with antibiotics and generally subsides in about 5
days. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramping, and fever
