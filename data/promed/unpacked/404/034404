First new British nv-CJD case reported in three months.
The first British case in three months of nv-CJD has been reported to
scientists advising the government, it was disclosed Wednesday. The total
number of confirmed British cases of the new strain of Creutzfeldt Jakob
Disease (CJD), which the government linked to mad cow disease, or Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), in March 1996, now stands at 24.
The new case was disclosed in a Ministry of Agriculture report on the last
meeting of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) which
advises the government on the progress of CJD and measures to avoid its
spread. The committee, which met on March 9, noted that the number of BSE
cases was continuing to decline.
But it also urged London to initiate further research into the possibility
that some cattle which do not show any symptoms of mad cow disease may
carry BSE. Experiments had shown that in certain conditions BSE-type agents
can exist in mice without making them ill.
