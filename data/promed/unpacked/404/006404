[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; Fam. Paramyxoviridae) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease. APMV-1 strains maintained in pigeon populations have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then it became pandemic.

Several Newcastle disease outbreaks in chickens have been attributed to PPMV-1, which makes it a real threat to the poultry industry.

The Eurasian collared dove (_Streptopelia decaocto_) is a species of dove native to warm temperate and subtropical Asia and can now be found from Southeast Asia through to Western Europe.
