15 500 ha of banana farms affected by disease
----------------------------------------------
Panama disease has already affected 15 500 hectares of banana farms in the Davao Region, especially those owned by small growers, according to 2015 data from the Department of Agriculture (DA).

Virgelio Gutierrez, DA [region] XI, said that they are providing interventions to the growers. Davao del Norte [is] the province that was largely hit by the disease, followed by Compostela Valley. "We have so far assisted 710 banana farmers," he said.

He said they have so far provided 45 000 Giant Cavendish Tissue-Cultured Variant 219, which was proven to be resistant of the disease. This variety is only given to those whose farms have 5 percent and above Fusarium Wilt infection.

Those banana farms with 5 percent and below infection were advised to do proper eradication protocols. DA XI also provided trichoderma harzianum, a beneficial fungus that could help manage the spread of the disease.

The Pilipino Banana Growers and Exporters Association has requested the DA to come up with a mapping of the affected areas by the disease.

Tully banana farm tests positive for Panama again
--------------------------------------------------
Almost one year to the day since Panama disease Tropical Race 4 was first detected at the Tully Valley farm, the farm has again tested positive.

About 12ha of banana plants on the property were destroyed and fenced off in a bid to contain the disease, which is easily spread. Despite the efforts, a BQ [Biosecurity Queensland] spokesman confirmed a 4th positive detection of TR4 on the quarantined farm.

"BQ will destroy other banana plants in the immediate area where this plant was found, [but] this detection is not surprising and there may be more in the future," he said. "This is why we conduct regular surveillance. ..."

Both the grower and the Australian Banana Growers' Council concede the best option would be to shut the farm down completely, but negotiations on an industry-funded buyout and closure have failed.

[A] Mareeba [less than 200 km north of Tully] farmer is locked in a battle with authorities after a "false positive" test [see ProMED-mail post 20150411.3288176 and links below].

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents (as mentioned in item 1 above). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But tropical race 4 (TR4), which is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia, has recently also spread outside that area (for example, ProMED-mail posts 20131107.2044265 & 20131206.2095450; see map below for current distribution). It is of great concern worldwide.

_Trichoderma harzianum_ is a fungus that is also used as a fungicidal biocontrol agent for foliar applications as well as seed and soil treatments. It has been reported to be successful for suppression of various fungal pathogens including soil-inhabiting species of _Fusarium_, _Rhizoctonia_, _Sclerotium_, _Sclerotinia_ and _Botrytis_.
