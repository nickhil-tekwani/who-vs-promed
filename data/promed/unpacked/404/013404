2 fatal cases of rabies have been recorded in Kyrgyzstan in 2015. This was reported to the 24.kg News Agency by the press service of the Disease Prevention and Sanitary Inspection Department.

According to them, the last case was registered in Kara-Suu district of Osh region, [where] on 1 Nov 2015, a rabies- infected dog bit animals and local residents in the village of Uchar. "As a result, a 2-year-old girl died in a hospital 10 days later. The animal has bitten 4 children, who received treatment. Their condition is stable," the press service reported.

They added that in mid-2015, the death of a 72-year-old man was recorded in Kara-Buura district of Talas region. Having been bitten by a jackal, he turned for medical help only after clinical manifestations of the disease, when the doctors were not able to provide the necessary aid.

At least 4 people have died of the infection in the Kyrgyz Republic during the last 3 years.

Cambodia has the highest rate of rabies deaths per capita in the world, with an estimated 850 people killed every year by the virus. Although rabies is preventable if treated quickly, there are few treatment centers, and almost none of the country's roughly 4 million dogs are vaccinated against the virus. As a result, a Cambodian is as likely to be killed by rabies as a citizen of Western Europe is to be killed in a traffic accident.

The ASEAN Rabies Elimination Strategy, which has been endorsed by Cambodia, aims to wipe out the disease by 2030. The Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture are drafting a strategic plan to eliminate the disease, but the head of the epidemiology department and the rabies prevention clinic at the Pasteur Institute, Dr. Arnaud Tarantola, said it could take decades to eliminate canine rabies from the country.
"If you want to eliminate canine rabies, you have to vaccinate all the dogs," he said. "And it will probably take 2 decades before all the dogs are routinely and regularly vaccinated in Cambodia."

Dr. Ly Sovann, head of the communicable diseases control department of the Ministry of Health, said the disproportionate number of rabies cases in Cambodia has a simple explanation: the country has too many dogs. He estimated there are roughly 4 million dogs in the country, one for every 3 humans. The dogs are usually domesticated, not strays. More than 98 percent of Cambodians who went to the Pasteur Institute for rabies prevention after a bite said they were bitten by their dog or a neighbor's dog. If dogs become rabid, they will often bite multiple people before they can be put down. Despite the risk, people are often reluctant to pay to vaccinate their dogs against rabies. "People are loath to vaccinate their animals in general, and their dogs especially," said Dr. Tarantola.

Though other countries such as the United States have laws requiring people to vaccinate dogs against rabies, Cambodia has no such law. And with little funding for vaccinations, the government cannot afford to provide free canine vaccinations. With the goal of vaccinating the country's dogs out of reach for now, attention remains focused on vaccinating people who are bitten. If treated quickly, infection by the virus is completely curable. But if left untreated, rabies is one of the most lethal infectious diseases in the world, killing 100 percent of people who develop neurological symptoms.

There are currently just 2 treatment centers for rabies in the entire country, both in Phnom Penh. Most healthcare centers outside of Phnom Penh do not store rabies vaccines because of the high cost, and because the vaccines are rarely used. While some private medical practitioners have the vaccine, it may often be counterfeit, ill-stored, or expired.

The lack of nearby rabies treatment proved fatal for Ms. Vann, a Battambang resident, whose 1st name was withheld for privacy reasons. After she was nipped on the hand by her dog in late May [2015], she went to the local doctor for treatment. The doctor was out of rabies medication, however, so she didn't receive treatment. The bite healed quickly, and she did not return for a rabies shot. One morning 2 months later, her son said she was terrified of getting in the shower. She had one of the classic symptoms of late-stage rabies, fear of water, or hydrophobia. She was transported to a Phnom Penh hospital, but it was too late: she couldn't be treated and died 2 days later.

The tragedy spurred action. After Ms. Vann's death, her neighbors in Battambang all decided to vaccinate their dogs. "People, when they know someone who died, will tend to get vaccinated or vaccinate their dogs," said Dr. Tarantola. "But when they don't know someone who died [of rabies] in their immediate surroundings -- and most people don't -- then the only thing you can place your hope in is a good information campaign and a change to the law."

The government's new strategic plan for dealing with rabies aims to prevent tragic cases like Ms. Vann's by introducing new rules for animal vaccinations and creating more rabies treatment centers outside the capital. "We are in the final stage of drafting [the plan]," said Dr. Sovann, "and have already started implementing parts." Still, it may take years for the new treatment centers to be completed. Meanwhile, the government is also using an informational TV, newspaper, and radio campaign to inform citizens about the disease.

Long a neglected disease, rabies needs to be brought into the spotlight, said Dr. Sovann. "As the number of HIV-AIDs and tuberculosis cases are down, there should be more attention to neglected diseases, such as rabies," he said. "People need to work together to eliminate the disease in animals and humans."

[Though the rabies situation in Cambodia, as described, is of serious concern, achieving satisfactory results within a relatively short time frame is within reach, since this country enjoys, according to the report, the fortunate situation where most dogs are owned and docile. In countries where most dogs are strays, even if their population is smaller, the prospects are significantly less promising, the timeframe longer, and costs higher.

Hopefully, the rewarding cost benefit ratio warranted by this case will help Cambodia's veterinary authorities obtain the needed financial support from donors for the vaccination and identification of the dog population as soon as possible. Public education will be the initial and essential part of the operation.
