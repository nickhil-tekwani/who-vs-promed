Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: As part of routine surveillance for H5/H7 Avian Influenza, H5 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) was detected in a commercial duck breeder flock. Partial HA sequencing determined the H5 to be a LPAI virus of North American wild bird lineage. Further characterization is pending virus recovery. There have been no clinical signs of illness or increased mortality on the premises. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding. Two additional commercial poultry premises associated with the initial premises have been quarantined and sampled for avian influenza virus. Results are pending.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory (Local laboratory) / birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 19 Apr 2019 / positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (national laboratory) / birds / gene sequencing / 22 Apr 2019 / positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (national laboratory) / birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 20 Apr 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness". https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/ai

"LPAI viruses typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and respiratory secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must 1st be cleaned from the environment.

"When LPAI findings occur, APHIS and its state partners work to address them quickly and keep the disease from spreading to new flocks. Because LPAI does not typically kill poultry the way that HPAI does, there may be additional control options beyond depopulation. Federal and state officials will work with producer to determine what option(s) are available."
