["Unlike for many other diseases, the tools needed to eliminate dog-mediated rabies already exist. It is 100% preventable, and rabies vaccines for dogs can efficiently eliminate the disease at its animal source.

"Dog vaccination has contributed to eliminating rabies as a major public health and economic burden in several countries around the world" (https://www.oie.int/en/disease/rabies/).

To mark World Rabies Day, the OIE has revamped its rabies portal, which hosts up-to-date information on the disease. See OIE Rabies Portal at https://www.oie.int/en/disease/rabies/.

"September 28 is World Rabies Day, a global health observance started in 2007 to raise awareness about rabies and bring together partners to enhance prevention and control efforts worldwide. World Rabies Day is observed in many countries, including the United States" (https://www.cdc.gov/worldrabiesday/).

Melilla is a Spanish autonomous city located on the northwest coast of Africa, sharing a border with Morocco. It has an area of 12.3 sq km (4.7 sq mi). Melilla is one of 2 permanently inhabited Spanish cities in mainland Africa, the other being nearby Ceuta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla). Rabies is endemic in Morocco.
