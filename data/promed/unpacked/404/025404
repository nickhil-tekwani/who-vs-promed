Vaccinated people can transmit vaccinia virus
New research on smallpox vaccinations
-------------------
Experts poring over data from past widespread smallpox vaccinations
conclude the live virus used in the vaccine may result in cases of contact
vaccinia -- the spreading of the vaccinia virus from someone recently
vaccinated to someone who has not had the shot.
Vaccinia, a less virulent relative of smallpox, is the live virus used in
smallpox vaccinations. People with skin disorders like eczema can spread
the virus across their own skin and potentially infect others who aren't
vaccinated. The vaccinia virus may cause a rash, fever, and head or body aches.
The researchers, led by Dr. John Neff, a former researcher with the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention's Smallpox Eradication Program,
discussed what they found in a commentary in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association released today.
Their research focused on mass vaccinations in the United States, United
Kingdom, and Sweden from 1947 to 1968. Overall, in the U.S. studies, the
rate of contact vaccinia was in the range of 2 to 6 per 100 000 vaccinations.
The majority of such cases -Â­ a few of which resulted in death -- occurred
in children with eczema, a skin disorder characterized by itchy red skin
and even blisters in severe cases. The disease was more likely to be spread
to people with a history of eczema even though they had no active skin lesions.
Age distribution of those U.S. cases shows young people are more vulnerable
to contact vaccinia:
Younger than 1 year: 25 cases
One to 4 years of age: 113 cases
Five to 19 years of age: 40 cases
Twenty years or older: 44 cases
That translates to 62 percent of the cases occurring in children 5 years
old or younger and almost 20 percent in those 20 years or older, according
to the study.
Most cases happened in the home, with many victims getting the virus from
vaccinated family members or playmates. In rare cases, transmission
occurred from a vaccinated nurse to a patient.
"The risk (of contact vaccinia) is not large," the researchers write. "This
risk needs to be kept in perspective." But they do admit that in this day
and age we're more susceptible than past generations. Why?
Since widespread smallpox vaccinations stopped in 1972, almost everyone
born since then has no immunity to vaccinia, according to the authors. If
vaccinated, this group could spread the virus for up to 19 days. Even those
who have had a smallpox shot in the past could shed more of the virus and
for a longer period of time depending on how long it's been since their
last vaccination and how many shots they've had in all. In short, most
people born before 1972 have had only one smallpox shot and they would
probably react as if they've never had one at all.
Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, is more prevalent today. In the
United States, rates have increased from 3 to 6 percent to 6 to 22 percent
in the past 30 years, according to the researchers.
Today there are more people with weak immune systems. The authors theorize
that's likely due to the spread of HIV and wider use of drugs to suppress
the immune system for cancer patients and organ transplant recipients, for
example. "Contact vaccinia in this population could be especially serious,"
the authors write.
Preparation and a carefully crafted vaccine policy is key to keeping
contact vaccinia under control should mass smallpox vaccinations become a
reality, according to the commentary.
They recommend public health officials carefully screen for those with a
history of eczema and compromised immune systems. The public should be
informed about how contact vaccinia is spread and how to avoid it. Finally,
a surveillance system needs to be in place to document and track adverse
reactions to the vaccine.

[This is a very interesting article addressing the observed rates of
contact vaccinia during the period of time when routine smallpox
vaccinations were administered. It is a nice addition to the body of
evidence for development of a smallpox vaccination strategy based on the
concept of "data for decision making". The article reference is:
Neff JM, Lane JM, Fulginiti VA, Henderson DA. Transmission of Vaccinia
Virus JAMA 16 Oct 2002 288 /15.
The data presented in the above newswire are from different studies that
were used as part of this review. Readers are referred to the actual
article for a more detailed discussion of the epidemiology of contact
vaccinia during the 50's, 60's, and 70's.
The authors are very prudent in adding the comment about the increased
numbers of people in today's environment with weakened immune
systems. Subscribers are once again referred to the earlier discussions on
ProMED-mail (see the 2002 postings listed in the "see also" section below)
for discussions and estimates of what proportion of the population may need
to be excluded from vaccination either because of their own personal risk
factors or because of risk factors in their close contacts (up to 25
percent in some calculations).
With respect to the recommendation that "a surveillance system needs to be
in place to document and track adverse reactions to the vaccine," such a
system is in place already and is used for all vaccines administered. The
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) <http://www.vaers.org/>, is
"a cooperative program for vaccine safety of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
VAERS is a post-marketing safety surveillance program, collecting
information about adverse events (possible side effects) that occur after
the administration of US licensed vaccines." If smallpox vaccinations were
to be resumed, adverse reactions to vaccination should/would be reported
through this system.
Of additional note and worthy of commentary is that on the CNN website,
where the above article was posted, there was a "quick vote" available for
readers to address the question, "Would you get a smallpox vaccination if
one was available to you?" It was very interesting to see the results as
of the time mentioned below, where 45 percent of those voting said they
would get the vaccine now. This suggests that among those who chose to
take the survey, there has been enough concern raised on the theoretical
risk of intentional release of smallpox virus as part of a bioterrorist
attack to warrant risking possible serious complications from exposure to a
vaccine with known serious side effects.
(Results of quick vote Created: Tue Oct 15 16:18:33 EDT 2002
Would you get a smallpox vaccination if one was available to you?
Yes 45 percent 508 votes
No 23 percent 259 votes
Not now, but maybe in the future 33 percent 374 votes
Total: 1141 votes
