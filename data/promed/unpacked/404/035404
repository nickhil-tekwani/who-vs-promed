Veterinary scientists in the Republic are examining the possibility that bird flu may have killed over 30 swans at a Co Donegal lake.

Just a few miles from Dunfanaghy [County Donegal] a wildlife haven called the New Lake is the permanent homes to scores of swans. It's normally a safe haven, however, now investigations are underway to determine how a number of the swans have died.

In recent days 33 swans have been recovered from the waters of the lake. It's thought they may have died over a 4 week period.

The dead animals have been collected by the Republic's National Parks and Wildlife Service and samples have been sent to veterinary laboratories for testing. A number of sick swans have also been rescued by the park service.

It's also emerged that tests are being carried out at another lake following the discovery of more dead animals.

Poisoning or water pollution is being considered as a cause of the deaths.

However, bird flu [avian influenza] hasn't been ruled out much to the concern of residents living along the shoreline.

Because of those concerns around what has caused the deaths, the public are being warned that if they find a dead swan not to lift it or touch it.
