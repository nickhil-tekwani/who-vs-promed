Dear Colleagues,

Sometimes we need to be reminded of just how important something is to our lives. Each year, as we undertake finding the funding to support our work, I am reminded of just how important ProMED-mail is to so many people. But, given the number of subscribers and the high regard in which ProMED is apparently held, why is it so difficult to raise the money needed to keep it alive?

I am writing today to remind you that ProMED needs your help.

Ninety-six percent of our subscribers say they rely on ProMED to stay aware of outbreaks and events. They read ProMED on a daily basis and most use it in their work. ProMED provides the detailed, comprehensive news and evidence-based information that help you understand what is happening now around the globe. Multiple times each day, ProMED brings you accurate, relevant, and timely emerging infectious disease reporting. Every day, ProMED brings you news and unique expert interpretation and context that informs you about the disease and helps you understand how it might affect you, your family, your patients, your business, and your plans. ProMED provides the facts and perspective that are unavailable from other scientific sources; ProMED keeps the infectious disease community up to date on topics long after public interest has faded. But to maintain this level of coverage, ProMED needs your support today.

If you use ProMED-mail in your daily work, you should pay your fair share.
