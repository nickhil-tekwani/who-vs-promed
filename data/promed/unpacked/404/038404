Sofia Gas Poisoning Was Accident, Police Say
-------------------------------------------------
Bulgarian authorities said Friday that a release of toxic gas in a police
office lobby, which caused the hospitalisation of 49 people, was an
accident and not a terrorist attack.
Police arrested a 50-year-old man, who said he accidently dropped an
ampoule of chloro-picrine that was in his pocket while at the traffic
police central office in Sofia.
"It was an accident," Boyko Borisov, a senior Interior Ministry officials
told reporters after questioning the man, identified as Georgi Hadzhiivanov.
He was to remain in custody pending criminal charges, Borisov said.
It was not immediately clear either how Hadzhiivanov obtained -- and why he
held -- the chloro-picrine, an obsolete weapons-grade tear gas that can be
fatal if inhaled in large quantities. It is also rarely used as a pesticide
in farming.
The life of one man was in danger, and 4 other were in critical condition
after inhaling the gas, the Sofia military hospital said.
Another 44 people were treated for lighter poisoning, but their situation
could also worsen, as the chloro-picrine could have delayed effects, said
Dr. Aneta Hubenova, a toxicologist from SofiaÂ’s emergency hospital.
Civil Defence officials, who measured the levels of gas in the air at the
site of the accident, said there was no further risk for the public.
