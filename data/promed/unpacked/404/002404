-----------------------------------------------
Defoliation, dieback and mortality of Satsuma mandarin (_Citrus unshiu_), as well as kumquat (_Fortunella margarita_), in Shaanxi Province was 1st noticed in 2006 and caused substantial economic losses to citrus production. The incidence of leaves infected approached 100 percent in some badly infected orchards. The disease prevailed only in late winter and early spring, where early symptoms were rounded leaves with target-like spots. The disease was named target spot.

Black conidiomata were observed on the upper surface of the leaves. A _Cryptosporiopsis_ species was consistently recovered from the infected leaves, shoots, and branches. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by inoculating a conidial suspension onto the leaves of Satsuma mandarin.

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that this taxon clustered in _Cryptosporiopsis_ (teleomorph: Neofabraea, Dermateaceae) and that the isolates constituted a distinct clade. Further study also demonstrated that this taxon was morphologically distinct from other species of _Cryptosporiopsis_, thus suggesting it might belong to an undescribed species. The name _Cryptosporiopsis citricarpa_ sp. nov. is given to accommodate the fungal pathogen in this study.

[A leaf spot disease of citrus caused by the related species _Cryptosporiopsis citri_ has been described from the Pacific Islands. Additional pathogens in the genus affect other tree species such as cashew, apple and eucalypts, as well as a range of herbaceous hosts.
