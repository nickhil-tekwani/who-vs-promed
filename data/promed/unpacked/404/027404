"Two serious viral diseases are affecting Turkey's citrus cultivation and threatening all the Mediterranean countries." This was reported by Antonino Catara, former president of the International Organisation of Citrus Virologists. "One of the 2 diseases is Citrus Chlorotic Dwarf, CCD, which mainly affects lemon and grapefruit plants. The disease, whose presence is currently reported only in Turkey, [affects] more than 60% of the plants in some provinces. The other disease [is] known as 'yellow discoloration of the veins' (Citrus Yellow Vein Clearing, CYVC)."

All citrus fruits, varieties, and rootstocks may be carriers of the 2 viruses in latent form, and therefore act as sources of inoculation not easily monitored by phytosanitary services. "Since the 2 diseases are not currently included in the list of pathogens of European plant health significance, while their vector insects are widely spread, it is essential to take all precautionary measures, alerting the responsible plant protection bodies at both national and European levels to ensure that appropriate measures are being taken," Catara [said].

"The responsibility of operators, researchers, and collectors is a prerequisite to avoid exposing the sector to further risks. The available diagnostic techniques are well suited to carry out all necessary tests of the propagation material. As required for all viruses and viroids, such measures are indispensable on mother plants."

[Citrus chlorotic dwarf disease was 1st reported from Mediterranean Turkey in the 1980s and has been spreading in the area. A viral agent was suspected. Symptoms may include crinkling, mottling, distortion, and reduced size of leaves. Young trees may be stunted with a bushy growth habit. Yield losses and reduction of fruit quality can be severe, depending on the citrus species or hybrid. In 2012, the causal _Citrus chlorotic dwarf associated virus_ (CCDaV; family Geminiviridae, not assigned to genus yet) was characterised (see link below). It is transmitted by the whitefly vector _Parabemisia myricae_ but can also be spread by mechanical means and grafting. Symptomless infections can occur and act as sources of inoculum in orchards. Some level of tolerance to the disease has only been found in sweet orange varieties.

Citrus yellow vein clearing disease is present in some Asian countries but was reported for the 1st time from the Mediterranean region in Turkey in 1997. Symptoms may include vein yellowing and/or clearing, leaf distortion, ringspots and veinal necrosis, depending on citrus species or hybrid. The causal _Citrus yellow vein clearing virus_ (CYVCV; genus _Mandarivirus_) was also characterised in 2012 (see link below). It is related to _Indian citrus ringspot virus_ (ICRSV; see ProMED-mail post 20111216.3609), and symptoms may be very similar in some citrus hosts. Both CYVCV and ICRSV can be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting.

While neither CCDaV nor CYVCV are "new" in Mediterranean Turkey, as seems to be implied in the story above, this is a timely reminder of the threat they pose to citrus in the Mediterranean region, as well as the importance of reliable molecular diagnosis and quarantine measures to prevent virus spread within and between countries.
