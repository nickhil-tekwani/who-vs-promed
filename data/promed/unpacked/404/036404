Farmers face huge losses from fungal tikka disease, which is one of the most common diseases in almond groves at this time. There are 2 types of tikka: leaf spot and nabi spot. If the incidence of disease is high, there is a risk of severe loss of yield. Quick spot on almond leaves is one of the major diseases of Chinese almonds in West Bengal state.

["Chinese" (or bitter) almonds, as referred to above, are kernels of some varieties of apricot (_Prunus armeniaca_) that are grown specifically for the flavour of their seeds.

A few fungal pathogens causing leaf spots on stone fruit (_Prunus_ spp.) have been reported (see links below). However, the common name of "tikka" seems to be used generally for a disease of peanuts; in that crop, it is caused by species previously or currently classed in the genus _Mycosphaerella_, none of which seem to have been reported on _Prunus_.

It is, however, unclear whether perhaps both stone fruit trees and underplanted peanut crops are affected by (different or the same) leaf spot pathogens.
