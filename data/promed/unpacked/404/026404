Agriculture officials warned farmers to watch for signs of a cattle disease that can cause fever and lameness after 2 cases were found in Wisconsin.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, is unlikely to kill cattle, according to the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection [DATCP]. But its signs include fever, ulcers in the mouth, a swollen tongue, excessive salivation, and lameness or stiffness when walking.

Dr. Paul McGraw, the state veterinarian, said in a statement that the disease will remain a threat until a hard freeze kills the insects that spread the virus. EHD does not infect humans.

One concern is that EHD's signs are similar to foot-and-mouth disease, so officials want to make sure animals are tested to rule out the more serious illness, McGraw said.

DATCP spokeswoman Raechelle Cline said Friday [4 Oct 2013] that samples from 2 infected animals were submitted for tests in September [2013]. A rapid test done by a state lab identified the disease, and confirmation tests are pending at a federal lab.

This is the 1st year [2013] that EHD in cattle has been reported in Wisconsin. The disease is more common in southern states and among white-tailed deer.

There is no vaccine for EHD, Cline said. Veterinarians can prescribe anti-inflammatory medication and antibiotics to prevent problems with secondary bacterial infections. It's also important for farmers to provide palatable food for infected animals because of the pain cause by mouth sores, she said.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is closely related to bluetongue virus. However, these are very separate diseases. EHD is indeed common in cervids in many portions of the US. One must test the animals with specific tests. It would be helpful to know which tests were used to detect this disease.

There are other states that are finding this disease in cattle and are testing with serology and with PCR. This disease may have mutated to be more infective to cattle, or some cattle may have lost their resistance to this disease, or some combination of factors. We do know that it is more often being found in cattle.
