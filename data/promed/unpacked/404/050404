(California), Part 1 - Mod PKA
Susceptible period
-------------------
In the Imperial Valley of California, the fields that are most
vulnerable to Karnal bunt, _Tilletia indica_, are those that were
previously contaminated with KB spores, were planted with
infested seed or are planted to common wheat (i.e. hard red
wheat, which is more susceptible to KB than durum wheat). In
1996, 14 fields (960 acres) were planted with infested wheat
seed, and all tested negative for KB teliospores, In the same
year, less than 1,000 acres of common wheat were planted in the
valley; all of these fields also tested negative. Of the
remaining wheat acreage, approximately 90% was planted with one
of 3 durum varieties: Kronos (60%), Westbred Turbo (20%), an
Yavaros 79 (10%).
Unlike other smut and bunt fungi, _T. indica_ does not infect
seedlings. This fungus must infect plants between the beginning
of spike emergence and the end of flowering. A conservative
estimate of this period for 1996 was January 1 through March 22
for all wheat planted in the Valley. This estimate was derived
from data from 1996 durum wheat trials at the UC Desert Research
& Extension Center combined with trials from previous years.
In the Imperial Valley, wheat is planted between November 15 and
March 1. Most is planted between late November and January 1,
and in 1996, 71% was planted before January 1. Due to the heat
unit differences between winter and spring, the earlier wheat is
planted, the longer its growing season. For example, wheat
planted on November 15 requires 5 more days to reach heading
stage than wheat planted on December 15. Similarly, wheat
planted on January 13 required 17 fewer days to reach heading
than a December 15 planting. Combining these data with
performance data on the three most popular durum wheat varieties
grown the valley, we determined the time to heading as a function
of planting date.
Days to heading is the number of days from planting until 50% of
the spikes are fully emerged (peduncles visible). The period
from the beginning of spike emergence (the beginning of the KB-
susceptible period) to the completion of spike emergence (heading
date) is temperature-dependent and is approximately 5 days for
the January planting, 10 days for the December 15 planting, and
14 days for the November 15 planting. The number of days between
the heading date and the completion of flowering or anthesis (the
end of the KB-susceptible period) is influenced less by
temperature, and is estimated to be 5, 6 and 7 days for planting
dates of January 13, December 15 and November 15, respectively.
Utilizing information on estimated days to heading, along with
the above adjustments for days to the beginning of spike
emergence and to the end of flowering (period of KB-
susceptibility), we estimated the KB-susceptible period to be 10
days, 16 days and 21 days for planting dates of January 13,
December 15 and November 15, respectively.
For the three durum varieties, which vary in their time to
heading, the KB-susceptible period was calculated for three
planting dates. Taking these as representing the majority of
wheat varieties planted, and the three planting dates as
representative of the Imperial Valley planting times, the KB-
susceptible period in 1996 was estimated to begin January 8 and
end March 22. To be conservative and accommodate the few earlier
wheat plantings, we considered the period of January 1, 1996,
through March 31, 1996 as the KB-susceptible period.
Weather
-------
Dr. D.V. Singh of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute has
collected meteorological data in India during outbreaks of Karnal
bunt. These data associate the occurrence of KB with the
following weather parameters (Royer, 1984):
weekly mean maximum temperatures: 67 - 74 degrees F (19-23 C)
weekly mean minimum temperatures: 46 - 54 degrees F (8 - 12 C)
weekly mean relatively humidity: 80%
Another report (Singh et al. 1983) states, "If at the time of
anthesis, the temperature ranges between 67 - 47 degrees F and 46
- 50 degrees F (19 - 23 C, and 8-10 C) coupled with a slight
shower providing high atmospheric humidity, the disease gets
established very well." In the Imperial Valley, a total of 3 mm
of precipitation fell between November 1 and May 6 (1 mm in mid-
February and 2 mm in early March). Other studies note "the high
incidence of the disease...when the temperature ranges from 64-73
degrees F (18-25 C) and relative humidity is above 70% (Aujla et
al. 1977). While these weather data are very general, they
provide some measure for comparison with the 1996 Imperial Valley
weather conditions.
The KB-susceptible period was shortened by rising temperatures in
the Imperial Valley beginning around March 1. During this
period, temperatures were in the upper 70s to low 80s (higher
than Singh's maximum range) and maximum relative humidity was
between 65 and 75% (lower than Singh's reported humidity
requirements). Perhaps more important than maximum and minimum
temperatures was the duration of temperatures and humidities.
Daily temperatures on January 28 and 30, February 1, 2, 3, 10,
11, 12 and 21, and March 4, 5, 12 and 13 fell within the
temperature range associated with KB reported by Singh et al.
(1983). Of these dates, maximum humidities were above 70% on
January 28 and 30, February 1, 2, 3, 10, 11, 12 and March 13.
Minimum relative humidity on these days always dipped below 70%,
the minimum humidity associated with KB reported by Aujla et al.
(1977). Rain fell in the Imperial Valley only on February 12 (1
mm) and March 1 (2 mm). Even considering the microclimatic
conditions at the soil surface created by irrigated cropping
systems, we conclude that conditions required for KB to occur
rarely persisted longer than 24 hours in the Imperial Valley in
1996.
Summary
-------
The amount of disease occurring in or on any host is dependent
upon the presence of the pathogen in sufficient abundance, a
favorable environment and a susceptible host. For Karnal bunt of
wheat in the Imperial Valley, all three factors were at a minimum
in 1996. The amount of pathogen introduced was limited to a
small number of spores on wheat used to plant 960 acres, and the
weather conditions, planting dates and varieties were not
conducive to teliospore germination.
Considering the conditions that must be met for KB disease
development, it is not surprising that KB is a minor disease even
in areas where it is endemic. While it is not impossible for KB
to occur in the Imperial Valley, the probability of its
occurrence is very low.
