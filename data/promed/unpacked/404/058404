ProMed-mail reported yesterday (26 May 2015) on the first Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in free-range deer in Michigan.

The moderator made a statement, "With all of the positive deer we have had in Michigan lately, it is most amazing this is the 1st free-ranging animal that has been confirmed to have the disease. As such, it is likely that we may see more reports in free-range deer."

This is a 1st report of CWD in free range deer in Michigan. The moderator regrets the error, as there have been problems in Michigan with tuberculosis but not CWD. CWD should not be confused with tuberculosis, and the moderator regrets the error. Thank you to all our sharp-eyed readers for calling it to my attention. - Mod.TG
