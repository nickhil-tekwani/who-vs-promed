The number of anthrax cases is increasing in eastern Kazakhstan
---------------------------------------------------------------
Two more people were hospitalized with an anthrax diagnosis in Pavlodar
oblast. Hence, the number of infected people has increased to 10; 4 out of
them are sick with anthrax and 6 are those who have had contact with
anthrax cases. [Sic. See comment below. - Mod.MHJ]

The condition of the anthrax cases is moderate and the condition of
contacts is satisfactory. According to the Ministry of Emergencies in
Jolkudukskiy village 7 carcasses of cattle, 4 dead sheep/goats, and 1 horse
carcass have been found, burnt, and buried. Currently, anti epidemic
measures are being carried out.

[The 6 described as infected through contact are probably family members
who may have shared the meals of contaminated meat. Anthrax is not a
contagious disease; you do not catch it by being with an infected person.
This report is useful as it gives a more realistic picture of events in
these steppe villages. Multiple livestock cases are frequently involved,
not just a single animal butchered for its meat and reported by the public
health authorities. The bigger picture emphasises why anthrax is primarily
a veterinary problem, and why effective vaccination and control programmes
provide multiple social and economic benefits to these village agricultural
communities, way beyond those of just preventing human cases. - Mod.MHJ
