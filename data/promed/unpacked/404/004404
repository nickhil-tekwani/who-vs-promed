Nigeria
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 has been reported this week in Baruten LGA, Kwara state, with onset of paralysis on [22 Jan 2019]. This is the 2nd cVDPV2 AFP case reported from Kwara state. This new cVDPV2 case is the 1st one reported in Nigeria and globally in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.

- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighboring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of one of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. The most recent cVDPV2 isolated in the country was in Magaria district, Zinder province with an onset of paralysis on [5 Dec 2018].
- The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 reported in Niger in 2018 is 10. The outbreak is genetically-linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. Virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018 through 5 Dec 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.

Central Africa
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20.
- The most recent cVDPV2 AFP case was reported from Mufunga-Sampwe district in Haut-Katanga province with onset of paralysis on [7 Oct 2018].
- DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.

Horn of Africa
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week.
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- The most recent cVDPV2 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected on [11 Oct 2018] from Waberi district in Banadir province. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was isolated from an environmental sample also from Waberi district, Banadir province collected on [23 Aug 2018].
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nationwide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- One circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolate was detected, from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case (with onset of paralysis on [21 Oct 2018], in a 6-year old girl with no history of vaccination, from Molumbo district, Zambezia province), and 2 isolated from a community contact of the case reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.
- In January 2017, a single VDPV2 virus had been isolated from a 5-year old boy with AFP, also from Zambezia province (Mopeia district). Outbreak response was conducted in the 1st half of 2017 with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2).

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.

This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

[The positive environmental samples in Pakistan serve as an indicator that the WPV1 is still circulating in the region, even in the absence of paralytic cases. As for the circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 identified in a 2nd case in Kwara state, Nigeria, it appears as though local transmission of this cVDPV2 is now occurring in Kwara state.
