Mosquitoes blamed for horse deaths
----------------------------------
Mosquito-borne viruses have been identified as the killers of scores
of horses across eastern Australia.

Tests done by the Victorian Department of Primary Industries [DPI]
found Murray Valley encephalitis and Ross River viruses were
responsible for the outbreak.

To date, 18 horse deaths are confirmed in Victoria, and from more
than 110 cases reported in New South Wales, about 15 died or had to be
euthanised.

Victoria's deputy chief vet Andrew Cameron says the worst of the
outbreak is over.

"A number of exotic diseases were ruled out in this case and a lot of
hendravirus testing was also done and ruled out at the Animal Health
Laboratory at Geelong," he said.

"We used the DPI laboratory which has a very strong arbovirus
investigation capability as well."

[While Ross River and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses were
diagnosed, one wonders what happened to the diagnosis of Kunjin virus.
It seemed at some point they were all on the list of diagnostic rule
outs.

In other postings I have inquired what test method was used for the
diagnosis. Was it PCR? Was it serology? Is there any cross reactivity
in the testing? How many viruses were tested for? - Mod.TG]
