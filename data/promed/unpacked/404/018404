[Many thanks to Jack Soo for his translation of a Chinese language news
report on gastroenteritis in Hong Kong. In the first posting on foodborne
gastroenteritis in Hong Kong (Gastroenteritis, foodborne - China (Hong
Kong) 20020705.4672) there was mention of an outbreak associated with a
meal of prawns and fish at a restaurant. In that posting we speculated
that the etiology might be _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, as it is more
commonly seen following a seafood meal. In addition, there was mention of
the seasonal increase in gastroenteritis outbreaks with 34 different
outbreaks involving a total of 222 cases in the week preceding the
announcement of the specific outbreak in question. In this posting we have
confirmation that there has been increased activity, and at least one of
the outbreaks has been documented to be associated with _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_.
According to Gideon (<http://www.cyinfo.com>) _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is
a gram-negative bacillus found in marine water. Transmission is via raw or
incompletely cooked seafood or fish, or through wound infections after
exposure to contaminated sea water. The disease is found worldwide and is
particularly common in the Far East. Symptoms usually begin within 10 to
20 hours after ingestion of seafood, and persist for 2 to 10 days. Illness
is characterized by vomiting (50 percent of cases), abdominal pain and
watery or explosive diarrhea. Fever is noted in 25 percent of patients.
Dysentery has been described in some cases. Additional information on _V.
parahaemolyticus_ can be found at:
