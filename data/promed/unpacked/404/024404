Louisiana: Fatal St Louis Encephalitis Case Previously Listed as West Nile Case
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 Livingston Parish residents and a Baton Rouge man have been
diagnosed with mosquito-borne St. Louis encephalitis virus infection.
One of those Livingston Parish cases, a 64-year-old man, has died
from St. Louis encephalitis. His case apparently was listed
previously as a West Nile virus case. The 2 diseases give similar
results in preliminary screenings.
State Epidemiologist Dr. Raoult Ratard said Tuesday he expects the
St. Louis encephalitis cases to remain small in number. "It is fairly
late in the season and I would not expect St. Louis to blossom into
an outbreak. But, you never know," Ratard said. The encephalitis
season should end in about 5 weeks, he said. There were no new cases
in Caddo Parish, which has been the hardest hit by West Nile virus
infection, so it appears the disease is slowing down.
East Baton Rouge Parish Mosquito Abatement and Rodent Control
District Director Matt Yates said the one St. Louis encephalitis case
in his parish is a 43-year-old man who lives north of the Antioch
Road Park and 2-3 miles west of some of the Livingston Parish cases.
The Livingston cases are scattered across that parish, he said.
Mosquitoes carrying St. Louis encephalitis virus have been found in
surveillance traps in 5 locations in East Baton Rouge since the
beginning of August 2003.
On Tue 23 Sep 2003, the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals
reported the new St. Louis cases and also 8 new cases of West Nile
virus, bringing that disease's total to 67 Louisiana cases and one
death. A Tangipahoa Parish man was diagnosed earlier this summer with
Eastern equine encephalitis, which kills about 30 percent of those it
infects. So Louisiana now has 3 of the most common forms of
mosquito-carried encephalitis. 2 years ago, a St. Louis encephalitis
outbreak in the Monroe area killed 4 and made 71 people sick.
Only one of the state's West Nile virus cases is from East Baton
Rouge, which this time of year in 2002 reported 48 cases. Statewide
at this time in 2002, there were 287 cases of West Nile and 14
deaths. Lincoln, West Carroll, and Washington parishes all reported
their first human cases of West Nile virus, meaning 20 of the state's
64 parishes have been touched by a human case of West Nile virus.
Yates said the mosquito control district's traps have found an
increasing number of _Culex nigrapalpus_, the primary carrier for St.
Louis encephalitis. "_Culex nigrapalpus_ bites outdoors at night,"
Yates said. "People need to keep wearing the inspect repellent, even
if it is getting cooler. In the history of the district we have never
seen many of that species (_Cx.nigrapalpus_), a few here and there,"
Yates said. One possibility for the jump in _Cx nigrapalpus_ numbers
is the increased use of storm water retention ponds across the
parish, Yates said. "They like to breed in those. We are seeing more
problems associated with those structures, and that may account for
the increase in this species, but there may be something else going
on," he said. "It may have something to do with rainfall patterns."
Officials are asking people to reduce their risk of contracting West
Nile virus or St. Louis encephalitis by applying mosquito repellent,
wearing long sleeves and long pants, and avoiding use of perfumes or
colognes when outside for prolonged periods of time. Dead birds have
also been used as sentinels to alert health officials to presence of
the virus in an area. Only 5 parishes have not shown some evidence of
one of the 3 encephalitis viruses: Plaquemines, Red River, East
Carroll, Madison, and Tensas.

[The simultaneous presence in Louisiana of 3 different mosquito-borne
viruses causing encephalitis emphasizes the need for accuracy in
diagnosis. St Louis encephalitis virus is a member of the Japanese
encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses, which also includes West
Nile virus. Hence confusion can occur in preliminary diagnosis (as
initially occurred in the New York City outbreak of WNV in 1999 -
Mod.LM). Eastern equine encephalitis virus belongs to a different
virus group and is less likely to be confused with the others. As
with West Nile virus infection, St Louis encephalitis virus infection
results in clinical illness in only a small proportion of cases. The
disease is usually milder in children. However, in those children who
do become ill, there is a high frequency of encephalitis. As with
West Nile virus infection, the elderly are at greatest risk of severe
illness and death. St Louis encephalitis virus is maintained in a
culicine mosquito-bird-mosquito cycle with occasional amplification
in peridomestic birds. The virus is prevalent throughout the Western
hemisphere, causing occasional outbreaks in the midwestern and
southern states of the USA, but not usually in Central and South
America. - Mod.CP]
