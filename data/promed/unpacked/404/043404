As many as 103 cases of malaria have been detected in Kapilvastu in the past 8 months, according to the Kapilvastu District Health Office. It comes as a startling fact at a time when the government claims that malaria cases have been reduced by more than 75 per cent in the country.

At an interaction programme organised on the occasion of World Malaria Day today [27 Apr 2014] in Taulihawa, Udaya Chandra Chaurasiya, Chief of the malaria department at DPHO, said: "Out of blood samples of 1400 persons sent to the laboratory for tests in the past 8 months, 103 patients were found positive for the disease." Of the total, 19 cases were serious.

Mostly, the residents of Banganga, Mahendrakot and Motipur and other VDCs bordering the Indian villages and towns have been affected by the disease. The disease is transmitted from those workers who come to Nepal during holidays, said Chaurasiya.

According to Dr Ananta Sharma, Chief, DPHO, and medical superintendent of Taulihawa Hospital, they have initiated a campaign to curb the disease by distributing insecticide-treated nets to the residents of as many as 24 VDCs in order to protect them from mosquitoes.

Dr Sharma has advised people to keep their surroundings clean, to wear full length clothes, and to use mosquito nets while sleeping to keep themselves safe from malaria, elephantiasis, and Japanese encephalitis, among other diseases.

Malaria is caused by _Plasmodium_ parasites and is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito.
