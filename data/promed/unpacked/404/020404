Two more dengue cases have been confirmed in Webb County residents. One
patient had a travel history (Nuevo Laredo), the other did not. The date
of onset for each of these patients is 8/12/99.
To date, eight cases of dengue have been confirmed in Webb Co. residents.
Two of the eight cases are in patients who deny travel in the two weeks
prior to onset.
