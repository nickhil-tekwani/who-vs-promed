Turkish village quarantined after anthrax outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Turkish authorities quarantined a village in the southeast of the country
Tuesday after 8 villagers were diagnosed with anthrax, the Anatolia news
agency reported. The outbreak was discovered when one of those taken ill,
from the village of Cukurca, was taken to hospital in Bingol province.
Health authorities identified 7 other infected people in a subsequent check
in the village. 2 of those, a brother and a sister aged 10 and 9
respectively, were in a life-threatening situation, the doctor treating
them told Anatolia.
Officials immediately imposed a ban on animals leaving or entering the
village and began to destroy all the meat found in households, the report said.
Mehmet Bayiltmis, the father of the sick children, told the agency that up
to 85 sheep and goats had died in the past week and a vet called to the
village declared there was nothing to worry about. "He (the vet) told us we
could eat the meat of the animals except the internal organs. So some
villagers gave the meat of the dead animals to relatives and others sent
their sick animals to butchers in Bingol," he said. "We called the vet
again when more animals died. This time he told us it was anthrax," he added.
There are occasional anthrax cases in Turkey, especially in central and
eastern parts, although authorities says the disease is on the wane and
under control.
Anthrax occurs when animals eat contaminated vegetation, absorbing
bacterial spores that can live for decades.

[Anthrax is probably hyperenzootic in Turkey, with the number of human
cases reported annually in the >300 cases/year range: 1999 (690 cases);
2000 (396); 2001 (532); 2002 (368); & 2003 -- last year of available data
-- (325). "Waning" is a relative term. It is under-reported in Turkish
livestock. From this communication it is clear that the Turkish Ministry of
Agriculture needs to improve the continuing education standards and
curriculum for the veterinarians.
I have said this before and hold strongly by it -- that when there are
human cases of anthrax it is because the veterinarians (my profession) have
failed. There is a strange blindness by livestock owners to disregard
deaths in sheep and goats. All too often I have heard accounts of ovine or
caprine flock deaths having to reach 100 before a diagnosis is sought and
control procedures are implemented. I suspect it is because cattle are kept
by men and community leaders, and sheep and goats are looked after by women
and marginal groups. This is a bit of an over-statement to make the point,
but ignoring small ruminant health problems occurs far too often.
While the unit value of cattle is high and therefore the loss of one animal
is significant, families and communities depend on sheep and goats for
food, protein, wool and hair. Therefore their health may be affected more
by the latter animals' health than by that of cattle. - Mod.MHJ]
