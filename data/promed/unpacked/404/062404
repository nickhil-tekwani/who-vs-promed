The authorities are looking into a recent spike in bacterial infections that were associated with eating raw freshwater fish in the past. In a Friday [28 Aug 2020] circular to doctors seen by The Straits Times [ST] Ministry of Health (MOH) medical services director Kenneth Mak said 50 cases of invasive group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS) were reported by public hospitals last month [July 2020]. This is twice the average monthly figure of 25 from earlier this year [2020].

Laboratory tests showed that 18 of these cases were infected by GBS type III ST283, and the profile of these patients is similar to that of those who were infected by the same bacteria in a 2015 outbreak caused by eating raw freshwater fish. The National Environment Agency had subsequently banned the sale of such ready-to-eat fish by retail food places.

Most of the latest 18 cases were aged 65 years and above and developed septicaemia or bacteraemia, commonly known as blood poisoning. All of them were Chinese, said Associate Professor Mak in the circular. Most of the patients have been discharged but one patient died from an unrelated cause. "All medical practitioners are requested to remain vigilant and to refer all patients with symptoms suggestive of severe GBS to a hospital for assessment," he said.

It is not known if the July [2020] infections are linked to eating raw freshwater fish. ST has contacted the MOH and the Singapore Food Agency for more information.

In 2015, the highly infectious strain of bacteria caused an outbreak of blood poisoning in over 160 people, who suffered from fever, joint infection, and meningitis. A 50-year-old man lost all of his limbs, and another 54-year-old man fell into a 2-week coma and eventually lost his hearing.

GBS is a common bacterium found in the human gut and urinary tract of about 15 to 30 per cent of adults without causing disease, said Prof Mak. It may occasionally cause serious infections, and symptoms include fever, chills, and low alertness. Doctors who spoke to ST on Saturday [29 Aug 2020] confirmed that they had received the circular and warned that the disease could be easily misdiagnosed as COVID-19 or dengue fever. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said this is because the initial symptoms are "remarkably similar". "You don't want to put a strain on the existing system, already laden with COVID-19 and dengue... It confuses the picture," he said. Dr Leong added that he has seen at least 3 GBS cases in recent weeks, and said 50 cases was a lot, especially considering milder cases may not be identified.

Similarly, Dr Raymond Ong, a general practitioner at Intemedical 24 Hour Clinic, said the symptoms are the same as many other infections. Like COVID-19 and dengue, most people generally recover, but the infection is much more dangerous for the elderly and those who have pre-existing symptoms, he added. Both doctors stressed the importance of hygiene in food preparation and consumption. Dr Ong said: "The disease is transmitted through the faecal-oral route, so hand hygiene is very important." He advised consumers to wash their hands and not to cross-contaminate cooked and uncooked food. Dr Leong agreed, saying: "If we don't clean food with GBS, we end up as food for the GBS."

[Prior ProMED-mail posts (see also's below) reported an outbreak of invasive infections due to group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS, also called _Streptococcus agalactiae_) serotype III sequence type (ST) 283 that sickened 238 people in Singapore in 2015. This outbreak was linked to eating GBS-contaminated raw fish in "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centers (food courts), where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger. The dish typically is made from 2 freshwater fish species, Asian bighead carp and snakehead.

GBS ST283 that caused this foodborne outbreak of invasive disease in Singapore was subsequently reported to be widespread in humans and aquaculture in South East Asia; only 4 cases of GBS ST283 were said to be reported outside Asia (see ProMED-mail post Strep. Group B - Singapore: serotype III, ST283, invasive, foodborne, raw fish 20180719.5914097).

The news report above describes a recurrent outbreak of invasive infection due GBS serotype III ST 283 in 18 people in July 2020. It is unknown at this time if the July infections were linked to eating raw freshwater fish.

In December 2015, the Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA) banned the use of all freshwater fish in ready-to-eat raw fish dishes with immediate effect, because freshwater fish were found to have significantly higher bacterial contamination than saltwater fish. Food stalls, including those at hawker centers, coffee shops, and food courts were required to stop all sales of raw saltwater fish as well until they have shown that they can comply with the practices required for handling raw fish. Fish intended for raw consumption were required to go through appropriate cold chain management practices, handled hygienically throughout the supply chain, and kept separate from other fish intended for cooking to avoid cross contamination (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/nea-bans-use-of-all-freshwater-fish-in-ready-to-eat-raw-fish-dishes-from-dec-5).

GBS are Gram-positive cocci that produce beta-hemolysis when cultured on sheep blood agar. Streptococci are classified into several groups based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide. GBS colonize the vagina and gastrointestinal tract in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15-45 per cent and can cause chorioamnionitis, post-partum endometritis, and sepsis in pregnant women and pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in newborns following vaginal delivery in mothers with vaginal GBS colonization at the time of delivery.

GBS have been found to colonize the urethra in both men and women and can also colonize the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract; they are increasingly recognized as an invasive pathogen in diabetics and the elderly, causing sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infection (such as decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections), urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, peritonitis, and endophthalmitis (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/6/839.long).

GBS are also found in other animals including fish, cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. The strains that cause disease in humans, however, were said to be usually biochemically, metabolically, or serologically different from strains that cause disease in other animals (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf). However, GBS multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST-283, serotype III-4 with similar genotypes has been detected both in fish and in adult humans with invasive GBS disease in Southeast Asia, which suggested that there may be an epidemiological connection between the 2 host species, as previously described for a closely related streptococcal species, _Streptococcus iniae_ (http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/41). This epidemiologic connection has now been established in the Singapore outbreak (1-4).
