At least 70 more residents of Senator Ninoy Aquino town in Sultan Kudarat [province] have been reportedly confined in a hospital after allegedly eating horse meat, officials said yesterday [5 Apr 2014]. The latest cases brought to more than 100 the total number of victims of food poisoning over the past 4 days, said Nestor Casador, chief of the province's agriculture office.

Casador said Sultan Kudarat Gov. Suharto Mangudadatu has sent a team to investigate an alleged viral disease believed to be affecting the town's farm animals.

Of the more than 100 victims, 4 have died, and a majority is still under observation at the provincial hospital in Isulan town.

Earlier reports said the victims vomited and complained of stomach pain and diarrhea after eating horse meat in Barangay Tinalon on Wednesday [2 Apr 2014]. Municipal health officer Maricris Idio said more victims were rushed to the municipal hospital, but they have to transfer those in serious condition to the provincial hospital.

Veterinarians expressed belief the horse's meat might have been infected with a viral disease that caused the food poisoning.

[The meat could have been tainted with a number of different toxins. It is implausible that the number of illnesses described here would be from a virus.

Not long ago there was a scandal of horsemeat being mislabeled and sold as other types of meat. One of the concerns was the meat could contain phenylbutazone, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used in horses as an analgesia.

Phenylbutazone is toxic to bone marrow, and exposure to this substance has been associated with aplastic anemia, a potentially life-threatening blood disorder in which the body's bone marrow does not make enough new blood cells. If people are treated with phenylbutazone, aplastic anemia is estimated to occur in a small number of sensitive individuals at a rate of about 1 in 30 000. There are also uncertainties regarding the potential genotoxicity (the capacity to damage DNA of cells) and carcinogenicity of the substance.

However, this does not match the clinical signs reported in this case. These illnesses may be caused by drugs the horses were given before they were slaughtered, or drugs may have been added to the meat at the processing plant. Until some drug testing is done on the meat, it is not possible to determine what drug it may be.
