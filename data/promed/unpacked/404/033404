[Cabbage (_Brassica oleracea_ var. _capitata_) is one of the most important
winter vegetables in India. West Bengal is among the major producing states
with a total of around 65 000 ha [about 160 000 acres] planted with
cabbage. Important diseases of cabbage in India are, for example, damping
off of seedlings (caused by _Pythium_ fungi and occasionally by
_Phytophthora_ species), as well as downy mildew (caused by the fungus
_Hyaloperonospora parasitica_), but it is uncertain if either of these is
the 'Jhalsa' disease reported above.

Diamondback moth (_Plutella xylostella_) is considered the most destructive
insect pest of brassica crops worldwide.
