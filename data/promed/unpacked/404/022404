A mystery disease is killing cattle in western New South Wales, with losses so far in the hundreds.

Hay district veterinarian, Colin Peake, says the illness was first detected in October last year [2013].

A similar disease hit the Western Division in 2006 and again in 2009. Two farms near Hay and one at Mossgiel have been affected. Mr Peake says he is perplexed by the deaths with tests returning inconclusive results.

"There's a lot of diseases that have been ruled out, even lead poisoning has been ruled out," he said.

He says farmers should report any signs of the disease as soon as possible.

The fatal disease is most commonly affecting calves that are dying close to water, possibly because of fever.

Mr Peake says farmers have reported losses of more than half of their herds and symptoms include drooling and diarrhoea before dying.

"A lot of the cattle are either dead near a water course or water tanks or troughs," he said. "I think they've got a fever or they're very hot, they're trying to get to somewhere where they can cool down."

Mr Peake says if the illness persists for more than 2 weeks it spreads to older cows.

Farmers should report any signs of the illness as it is more easily identified in sick cattle or shortly after death.

The Department of Primary Industries is investigating the disease and says it is developing a questionnaire to examine the extent of the disease.

[A number of possibilities exist, but there is not enough information to come to much of a conclusion. Surely there is an investigation, necropsies, testing, etc. taking place. But this article does not tell us that.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) sounds a bit like this. The virus is carried by insects and it does cause the animals to seek water. Many of these animals die. While survivors may develop diarrhea for a time, it is not common.

EHD is related to bluetongue virus, but they are not the same virus.

Another thought is that this may be some form of blue-green algae in the water. Many of these toxic algae can cause death of the animals near the water sources.

We look forward to more information regarding the testing that is surely being done.
