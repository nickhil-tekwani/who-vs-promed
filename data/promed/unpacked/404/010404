The Technical Committee of the National Center for Disease Control that follows up pandemics held an emergency meeting at its Centre on Sun 28 Dec 2014, during which time the study of the current situation was discussed with regard to the current emergency cases of severe pneumonia: 10 cases of acute pneumonia with symptoms of "cough, fever, phlegm, accompanied by bleeding and with acute respiratory failure."

5 cases have died. The cases were as follows (from the Tripoli Medical Center):

- 2 cases of pregnant women in their 30s from Moatntan, one of them confirmed [diagnostically] infected with H1N1 influenza virus [by an unexplained procedure].
- The 3rd case is a young man in his 40s still in intensive care and waiting for lab results.
- The 4th case is a young man in his 30s who died, and whose lab results confirmed he was infected with influenza type A.
- The 5th case is a young man in his 30s still receiving treatment in the intensive care unit and waiting for lab results.
- A 6th case, a Libyan citizenship holder with the same symptoms, was taken from the Tripoli Medical Center to Asabieh Hospital and died at the hospital.

Cases in the city of Tobruk (4 cases with the same symptoms as 3 other patients):
- 2 brothers aged 28 and 40 years, but samples were not taken from them;
- 2nd case [3rd case?] died in Egypt, and there is no information about this patient; or
