Over 20 cows have been reported dead after a mysterious disease hit a village in Chuka Igambang'ombe Constituency [Tharaka Nithi county].

Villagers, especially farmers in Kiang'ondu, are now a worried lot, claiming the government has done little to help them and are calling on the national and county governments to step in and stop the disease from spreading.

Among those affected is Mutwiri Mutegi, a farmer, who claimed that a county livestock department representative had toured the village once but did not enforce quarantine in the face of the deadly disease. "This disease has been here close to a month now, and some symptoms, such as the cows' legs swelling, are easily noticeable," said Mutegi. He claimed that when they reported the matter, the officers demanded bribes, which they could not afford.

On their part, veterinary officers who toured the region said the signs and symptoms of the animals could be those of ramp skin and anthrax, a deadly disease that is highly contagious [sic. Anthrax is infectious, rarely contagious. - Mod.MHJ].

Reports indicated that over the last one week, 20 cows have died, and more than 30 households have animals that are already infected.

The farmers are now demanding an apology from the livestock department due to the loses they have incurred so far, while at the same time urging the county government to give assistance following the tragedy that has befallen them.

Back in October [2015], over 200 residents of Karandine Village in Imenti South, Meru County were rushed to hospital after consuming meat suspected to be from a cow infected with anthrax. In July 2015, an anthrax outbreak was reported in Rongai, Nakuru West and Nakuru East sub-counties. Following the outbreak, the county department of agriculture livestock and fisheries enforced a quarantine in all the affected areas.

[Chuka is a town on the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya in Kenya, about 65 km south of Meru Town. It falls within Tharaka Nithi County and the former Eastern Province. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuka,_Kenya. For a satellite image of Chuka, go to http://www.maplandia.com/kenya/eastern/chuka/.

Bovine anthrax is enzootic in Eastern Province counties, with outbreaks every year, though there are claims of significant vaccination. The veterinary response reality, as revealed by this report, is patently different, and it is clear that over a minimum of 30 animals have probably died. Cutaneous anthrax is known in cattle, and this may be what we are seeing now. If it is anthrax, I would expect to have seen accounts of human cases, as sick and dead livestock in Kenya are routinely butchered in poor rural areas. There is patently an urgent need for digital extraction by the veterinary service, a rapid determination as to the cause or causes, and the initiation of suitable treatment for the livestock in this area. - Mod.MHJ
