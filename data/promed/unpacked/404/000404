Yellow fever in Senegal
-----------------------
On 20 Sep 2010, the Ministry of Health in Senegal reported a
suspected case of yellow fever in Mbour health district in Thies
region, which is approximately 50 km [31 mi] from Dakar, where the
suspected case was hospitalized. The case was identified as a 27
year-old fisherman working in the Gambia (Tandji [Tanji] locality)
who presented with clinical symptoms of fever and jaundice. Blood
specimens from the patient were laboratory tested at the Institut
Pasteur de Dakar and found to be IgM positive by ELISA and confirmed
with PRNT [plaque reduction neutralization test], a more specific
test. The patient had no history of yellow fever vaccination.

A 2nd suspected case reported in Thies region, Senegal was also a
fisherman from Tanji locality in the Gambia, showing neurologic
symptoms including an altered mental state. This particular case was
found not to be confirmed by the Institut Pasteur de Dakar.

Through WHO, the Gambia has been informed of the situation in order
to assess the epidemiological situation in Tanji locality.

Senegal conducted a yellow fever preventive mass vaccination campaign
in 2007, targeting more than 3.1 million people in all 18 districts
not previously protected through outbreak response. In the health
district of Thies, 314 713 people were targeted and vaccination
coverage of 91.8 percent (88.3-95.3 percent) was achieved. This
preventive campaign was part of the global Yellow Fever Initiative
which aims to prevent yellow fever epidemics and secure adequate
yellow fever vaccine supply for Africa. Routine infant immunization
coverage against yellow fever in Senegal was 79 percent in 2009.

After the Gambia yellow fever outbreak in 1978-1979, a village-based
serological retrospective study estimated some 8000 cases and 1700
deaths had occurred. According to some reports, the national
vaccination coverage was estimated to be 95 percent in January 1979.
The national routine infant immunization coverage reported for 2009
was 99 percent.

In the face of high routine and recent preventive vaccination
coverage in both Senegal and the Gambia, an epidemic is not
anticipated and emergency vaccination is not required at this time.
Investigation around sporadic cases may identify pockets of
unimmunized individuals and guide immunization and vector control
strategies at the local level for those at risk.

[With the high percentage of yellow fever virus vaccinated
individuals in the Gambia and in Senegal, the risk of an outbreak
does seem unlikely.
