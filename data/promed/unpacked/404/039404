The animal disease bovine tuberculosis [TB] was detected in August 2016 in a wild deer in Franklin County, marking the first such discovery of the disease in Indiana history.

Deer hunters in south eastern Indiana are facing stricter deer inspections as the state responds to the discovery of bovine tuberculosis in that region. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources [DNR] says hunters who kill deer in Dearborn County north of State Road 48 between now and 27 Nov 2016 must take them to a DNR check station to be sampled for bovine TB.

The deer tissue sampling is mandatory in the affected portion of Dearborn County. The sampling is voluntary for deer taken in Franklin County and Fayette County south of State Road 44, but the DNR strongly encourages deer hunters in those areas to participate.

[As the article mentioned, a wildlife host of the disease will increase the amount of testing and surveillance required substantially.

"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _Mycobacterium bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB (bTB), caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

"Bovine tuberculosis results from infection by _M. bovis_, a Gram positive, acid-fast bacterium in the _M. tuberculosis_ complex of the family Mycobacteriaceae.

"_M. bovis_ is the causative agent of tuberculosis in cattle and has a broad host range that includes humans. In 1994, a wild white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) killed by a hunter in Alpena County, Michigan was found to have gross and microscopic lesions consistent with tuberculosis. _M. bovis_ was later isolated from affected tissues.

"_M. bovis_ infection has been diagnosed sporadically in wild white-tailed or mule deer (_Odocoileus hemionus_) in North America.

"With more than 19 million white-tailed deer, 5 million mule deer, and 750 000 elk (_Cervus elaphus_) in the United States, a reservoir of _M. bovis_ infection in free-ranging wildlife not only represents an emerging disease but also a threat to domestic livestock and the bovine tuberculosis eradication effort in the United States."
