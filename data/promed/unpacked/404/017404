[As of 6 Jun 2016, 33 states (AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, IA, KS, KY, ME, MA, MI, MN, MT, NE, NH, NJ, NY [including New York City], NC, ND, OH, OR, PA, SC, TN, TX, VA, and WI) in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 1272 people to CDC. Four states have reported more than 100 cases this year: IA, IN, IL and MA.

Although mumps cases have seen a sharp decline since the CDC began recommending a 2-dose vaccine prevention plan in 1988, outbreaks are still prevalent, particularly in high-contact social settings like college campuses. Mumps is transmittable through the air or by touching unwashed, contaminated surfaces, and the rising cases bring into question vaccination practices, waning immunity, and college healthcare.

Concerns unique to colleges
---------------------------
Mumps outbreaks can be difficult to detect at 1st because doctors are not always thinking about the disease, said Susan Even, MD, executive director of the University of Missouri Student Health Center and chair of the American College Health Association (ACHA)'s Vaccine Preventable Disease Advisory Committee. ...

One dose of the MMR vaccine affords 78 per cent protection, while 2 doses provide 88 per cent effectiveness, according to the CDC. The vaccine is the best prevention for mumps, and Even encourages colleges to ask for proof that their students are immunized and not just assume they are.

The disease is contagious at least 5 days before symptoms appear, and not all students experience or report symptoms.

Health agency warns of mumps exposure
-------------------------------------
The Branch-Hillsdale-St. Joseph Community Health Agency is asking health care providers to be on alert for potential exposures to mumps, particularly in Hillsdale County [Michigan]. They say the suspect case took place in an out-of-state camper who was attending a local camp. It's the 1st Hillsdale County case of the mumps since 2008.

Mumps is a highly contagious illness spread by contact with an infected person through coughing, sneezing, sharing utensils and other personal contact.

Symptoms include headaches, loss of appetite and a low grade ever. Infections with the mumps virus may also present with severe abdominal pain or pelvic pain. While mumps is usually a mild disease, there could be complications.

Health officials say you should check your immunization status with your health care provider.

Doctors are being asked to notify the health department of any suspect cases.

People who have mumps or are suspected of having mumps should notify their physician and follow medical directions.

There is no treatment for mumps, only supportive care such as bed rest, fluids and fever reducing medications.
