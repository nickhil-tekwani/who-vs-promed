[The current peste des petits ruminants (PPR) epizootic reportedly started on 5 Dec 2013, in northwestern China, spreading, within less than 4 months, throughout vast parts of the mega State along northern provinces in an eastward direction, and then spreading southwards in eastern China infecting the provinces Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and Anhui. For the locations of all 17 outbreaks since 5 Dec 2013, see the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/oqx8okm.

Since no figures are given for number of susceptible populations in each of the 7 above new outbreaks, number of killed animals might not represent the actual number of animals present in each farm (and exposed to infection?). Have only recently introduced animals, "purchased from other places," been affected/destroyed?

The rapid speed of the disease spread, as reported, is overwhelming. It will be helpful to note if previous possible presence of the PPR virus in those provinces has been excluded. The new outbreaks might, in such a situation, just reflect intensified surveillance and improved breeder/practitioner awareness.

China's PPR control policy is, according to the OIE reports, based upon stamping out without vaccination, combined with quarantine measures. Without vaccination, China's sheep and goat breeders may be experiencing grave concerns, facing a continued spread of this disastrous disease. China's PPR-susceptible animal population (2012 OIE data) is 143 680 000 sheep and 141 361 000 goats. - Mod.AS]
