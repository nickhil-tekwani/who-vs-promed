Syphilis cases in Garfield County [Oklahoma] are on the increase, enough so that health officials are calling for people who might be at risk to get tested.

Ten early [primary and secondary] syphilis cases were reported in Garfield County during all of 2012. So far this year [2013], 18 new cases have been reported. The Oklahoma State Department of Health has declared a syphilis outbreak among young adults in Enid and the surrounding areas. [The city of Enid is the county seat of Garfield County.]

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease that can have significant health outcomes if left untreated. Health officials also are concerned that the outbreak can spread to other counties. "The good news is that syphilis can be identified by examination and testing, cured with antibiotics, and through disease investigation, the spread of syphilis can be stopped," said Chad Newton, Garfield County Health Department administrative director. "We want to encourage people to seek testing and treatment if they have been having unprotected sex." County health departments offer free, confidential testing and treatment, Newton said.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection spread through sexual or intimate contact, including kissing when a syphilis sore is present in the mouth. Often, the primary sore, called a chancre, develops during the early stage of the disease. However, it may go unnoticed, as it is painless and can be on or in a man's or woman's sex organs, anus or mouth. Usually, the sore will go away even without treatment, but the disease still can be passed along unless it's treated. Other symptoms of syphilis include rashes that appear as rough, red or reddish-brown spots on the palms of hands and bottoms of the feet, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, and fatigue.

Early detection and treatment prevent further damage from the disease and also may reduce the risk for HIV transmission. Untreated syphilis can damage major organs, especially the brain and blood vessels, as well as cause serious birth defects.

"There are many effective ways to prevent, diagnose and treat syphilis and other STDs," Newton said. "Consistent condom use is one effective way to prevent becoming infected with STDs, including syphilis. Once infected, STD screening and early diagnosis are vital to prevent serious health consequences and increased transmission. Screening is particularly important, since many STDs often have no signs or symptoms."

[The news report above fails to characterize the cases of early syphilis, other than to say that the outbreak in Garfield County, Oklahoma is occurring among young adults in the city of Enid and the surrounding areas, where over 80 percent of the county's population resides. Enid is home to Vance Air Force Base, a major employer in the area of both soldiers and civilians, but we are not told whether any of the syphilis cases have linkage to the air force base. A more detailed description of the cases would be appreciated.

In 2000 in the U.S., the number of cases and the incidence rate of primary and secondary syphilis (P&S), the contagious stages of syphilis, were 5979 and 2.1, respectively, the lowest since reporting began in 1941 (Table 1, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). The number of cases and incidence rate of P&S then increased almost yearly to 13 970 and 4.5 per 100 000 in 2011 (Table 1, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/1.htm). The southern region of the U.S. accounted for 44.1 percent of P&S cases in 2011 (Table 26, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/26.htm).

Oklahoma had the 33rd highest incidence rate for P&S of 2.2 per 100 000 among all the states in 2011 (Table 25, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/25.htm) and accounted for 0.6 percent of P&S in the country in 2011 (table 26, http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats11/tables/26.htm).

Garfield County, with a population of 60 580 in 2010, is located in the north-central region of the U.S. state of Oklahoma (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_County,_Oklahoma). Enid, with a population of 49 379, is the county seat and largest city in Garfield County (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enid,_Oklahoma). Primary industries in Garfield County are agriculture and livestock, and Enid has the largest grain storage capacity in the U.S. - Mod.ML
