Wildlife officials are trying to determine the cause of a fish die-off in a Northern California lake. Hundreds of dead carp have lined the shores of Lake Mendocino, about 10 miles [16 km] northeast of Ukiah.

US Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Ryan McClymont says the carp were first reported Sunday [25 May 2014].

State fish and wildlife biologists have been called in to investigate.

McClymont tells The Press Democrat of Santa Rosa (http://bit.ly/1wiSUH0) that the water doesn't appear to be too warm or lack oxygen since the die-off is affecting only carp, not other fish. He says the fish are resilient, but there are some diseases that affect only carp.

The discovery follows a fish die-off this month [May 2014] in a Southern California harbor. Tens of thousands of northern anchovies were found dead along the coastal waters of Marina del Rey. State authorities say the cause was too little oxygen.

[There is not enough information to make any sensible speculation. Viral diseases that affect carp are Koi herpesvirus disease and spring viremia of carp.
