Authorities have issued dengue alerts in 4 nations across Central America, where alarm is rising, as the mosquito-borne disease has infected 30 000 people and killed 17 this year alone [2013].

Honduras, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and El Salvador have issued formal alerts. In Guatemala and Panama, officials say they are monitoring the disease, which normally spreads more easily later in the rainy season. "It is great that they are coming around to fumigate; mosquitoes seem like no big deal, but they really can kill you," said Mauricio Gonzalez, a mechanic in the Nueva Esperanza district south of Tegucigalpa.

So far this year [2013], Honduras has had 10 deaths, 8380 cases of ordinary dengue, and 1219 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. In Honduras alone, the 2010 epidemic killed 83 people.

Health authorities said they have been baffled by this recent outbreak, which has occurred despite a spate of unusually dry weather. The mosquitoes that carry dengue usually proliferate in times of heavy rain.

There is no vaccine, so medical authorities in the region, where poverty is widespread, have been trying to stamp it out by focusing on mosquito control.

The illness can be fatal, developing into hemorrhagic fever, which can lead to shock and internal bleeding.

[Unusually dry conditions may lead people to store water in their houses and other buildings, providing breeding sites for _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito vector of the dengue viruses.
