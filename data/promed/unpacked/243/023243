Discovery of new avian flu strain closes BC school
-----------------------------------------------
A new strain of avian flu has been found in the Fraser Valley, one that is
different from anything that has been seen in the area before. The
discovery [of the new strain], among geese and ducks at the Abbotsford
farm, has prompted officials to close a school across the road.

Scientists could not rule out the possibility that the strain is the H5
virus responsible for the deaths of people in Asia, though they urged
people not to panic. "We don't know what it is," said Sally Greenwood, a
spokeswoman for the BC Centre for Disease Control. "It's not the H7 we have
seen in BC, we don't know what it is. There's a possibility it could come
back as being an H5 subtype. But, even if it does, it doesn't mean it's
going to be the same virus as the one in Asia. Let's wait until we get the
test results back."

Those are expected back in 48 hours.

Some 19 millions chickens and turkeys in the Fraser Valley are being culled
after an especially aggressive strain of H7 avian flu began killing off
birds in Mar 2004. But, unlike that outbreak, the geese and ducks aren't
showing any symptoms.

Greenwood said the mystery virus was discovered when blood tests of the
birds showed antibodies, indicating they had been exposed to it at some
point in the past. No children or staff at the nearby school showed any
signs of illness, she said. While the H7N3 virus was especially deadly to
birds, it was not considered dangerous to humans. 2 farm workers came down
with pink eye. However, the industry has been hard hit. Several Asian
countries closed their borders to Canadian or BC chicken products.

During the first week of May 2004, Agriculture officials estimated that it
could take until next Mar 2005 before the industry is up and running in the
province again.

The H and N represent different proteins. There are 15 varieties of the H
protein and 9 varieties of the N protein. The proteins combine in different
ways to make up specific viruses, some of them more deadly than others.
