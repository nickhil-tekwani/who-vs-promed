Local authorities in Nassiriyah, a town about 300 km south of
Baghdad, have asked livestock farmers to take all necessary
precautions after laboratory tests showed that some livestock had
developed Rift valley fever (RVF). "We were informed by local farmers
about strange symptoms appearing among sheep and cattle near
Nassiriyah," said Mandhor Rayhan, a spokesman for Dhi Qar provincial
council. "A veterinary doctor who examined the animals suggested they
should be laboratory tested for Rift valley fever, and the suspected
diagnosis was confirmed in at least 4 animals." [A map of Nassiriyah
can be seen at <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IZ/9/An_Nasiriyah.html>].
The Nassiriyah medical laboratory chief, Abdel-Rayy Muhammad, said
the samples confirmed as positive were being rechecked at the
National Baghdad Laboratory over the next 48 hours. "A recent phone
call from a senior official in the National Laboratory said there was
possible confirmation of one case, but other samples were waiting to
be tested," he said.
Fayad Sulaiman, a senior official in the Ministry of Agriculture in
Baghdad, told IRIN a group of specialists were on their way to Dhi
Qar to evaluate the situation. "We are retesting again, but, as a
precaution, we have sent some specialists to Nassiriyah. ... We hope
it is an isolated case," Sulaiman said.
"Some vaccines have been sent to Dhi Qar Governorate this morning,
and we have contacted companies to get more supplies, which should
arrive within a couple of days," he added. "We are seriously
concerned about the possibility that the disease might spread," Dhi
Qar provincial council spokesman Rayhan said, adding that affected
livestock farmers have been asked to confine their animals within a 2
sq km area until more specialised laboratory tests can be carried out
in Baghdad.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), RVF affects
livestock (including cattle, buffalo, sheep, goats and camels) as
well as humans. The disease mostly appears in Africa.
People get RVF mainly from infected mosquitoes, which act as vectors.
The disease can also be spread by contact with the blood or body
fluids of an infected animal. "Our concern is that with the situation
as it is in Iraq -- with increased poverty, displacement and pools of
stagnant water -- people might get infected by mosquito bites," said Rayhan.
Khalid Idris, a veterinary specialist in Nassiriyah who has been
dealing with the problem, told IRIN that livestock in the
contaminated farms must be vaccinated as a matter of urgency. "All
sheep, cattle and buffalo in herds within the infected area should be
vaccinated immediately with an inactivated RVF vaccine and
revaccinated after 2 to 4 weeks. But these vaccines have not been
available in Iraq since before the US-led invasion in 2003," Idris said.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said it had not
received any details of the outbreak but that it was in touch with
the Ministry of Agriculture.
In July 2001, the FAO said RVF had been detected among livestock in
Yemen and Saudi Arabia and warned of the possibility of the disease
spreading into Iraq. No case was confirmed then, but, since that
time, farmers have been advised to vaccinate their livestock
periodically, a procedure that, according to Idris, has not taken
place in Dhi Qar since February 2002. "We are urging international
organisations and the central government to find quick solutions to
the problem," Idris said.
The RVF virus can cause several different syndromes. People who are
infected with RVF either show no symptoms or develop a mild fever and
liver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the illness can
progress to haemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or
haemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead
to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular diseases.
Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalised
weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset
of the illness. Normally, RVF patients recover within 2 days to one
week after catching the illness.

[In the absence of details on the symptoms allegedly observed in the
cattle and sheep, and of the diagnostic tests applied and their
specificity, it is difficult to assess the significance of the above
suspicions. In previous RVF cases in the Middle East, cases in humans
preceded the reporting of animal disease.
RVF has never been diagnosed in Iraq; the only countries in the Near
East which have been affected by RVF in the past are Egypt, Yemen and
Saudi Arabia. During the late 1970's, RVF was reportedly suspected in
Egyptian laborers residing in Iraq, but their eventual diagnosis was
Congo-Crimean Haemorrhagic fever.
The clinical signs of RVF in animals vary with the age, species and
breed of the animal. In endemic regions, epidemics of Rift Valley
fever can be recognized by high mortality rates in newborn animals
and abortions in adults. In lambs, a biphasic fever, anorexia and
lymphadenopathy may be followed by weakness and death within 36
hours. Hemorrhagic diarrhea or abdominal pain can also be seen. The
youngest animals are most severely affected. In neonates, the
mortality rate may reach 90 to 100 percent. However, no ovine
neonates are expected yet in southern Iraq, where lambing is
anticipated to commence not earlier than the end November 2007.
Similar symptoms occur in young calves: fever, anorexia and
depression are typical, with mortality rates of 10 to 70 percent.
Abortions are the most characteristic sign in adult sheep and cattle.
Other symptoms that may occur in adult sheep include fever, weakness,
a mucopurulent nasal discharge (sometimes bloodstained), melena,
hemorrhagic or foul-smelling diarrhea, and vomiting. In adult cattle,
fever, anorexia, weakness, excessive salivation, fetid diarrhea and
decreased milk production have been reported. Icterus may also be
seen, particularly in cattle.
Similar but milder infections occur in goats. Adult camels do not
develop symptoms other than abortion, but young animals may have more
severe disease.

An extensive epizootic of RVF spread earlier this year [2007] in
eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa.
Further details, particularly confirmation (or otherwise) of the
diagnosis by a reference laboratory, are soon anticipated. Then OIE
reference laboratory for RVF is the Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute in South Africa. The NAMRU-3 laboratory in Cairo has been
helpful in the early diagnosis of outbreaks in the region. - Mod.AS]
