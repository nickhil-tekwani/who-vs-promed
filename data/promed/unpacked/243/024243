North Korea reported some 79 100 more people with fever symptoms and one additional death amid its 1st-confirmed coronavirus outbreak, state media KCNA said on Saturday [4 Jun 2022].

The reclusive country has been waging a battle against an unprecedented COVID-19 wave since declaring a state of emergency and imposing a nationwide lockdown last month [May 2022], fueling concerns over a lack of vaccines and medical and food supplies.

The total number of fever patients compiled across the country since late April [2022] neared 4 million, and the death toll rose by one to 71, KCNA said, using data from the state emergency epidemic prevention headquarters.

KCNA has said the epidemic has shown signs of subsiding after daily tallies of fever cases topped 390 000 2 weeks ago.

North Korea has never confirmed how many people have tested positive for COVID-19, apparently lacking testing supplies. But experts have said the publicised numbers could be underreported, and that could make it difficult to assess the actual scale of the situation.

[2] France: variants BA4 and BA5 increasing
Date: Fri 3 Jun 2022

The share of the BA4 and BA5 sub-lineages of the omicron variant is increasingly important in France. While the circulation of the virus continues to slow down in France, the BA4 and BA5 sub-variants are becoming increasingly important in sequencing, according to data from Public Health France.

It is still the BA2 sub-lineage of the omicron variant which is by far the majority. But it now represents 94% of interpretable sequences against 98% last week. This decrease is explained by the increase in the detection of BA4 and BA5: 0.8% for BA4 and 5% for BA5. There was 0.5% BA4 and 1.5% BA5 a week earlier.

Sant√© Publique France recalls that BA4 and BA5 were at the origin of a wave of contamination in South Africa where these sub-lineages were initially detected. But "the peak of the epidemic wave passed in mid-May, and its impact was very moderate," recalls SPF.

Note that the general decline in COVID-19 cases in France is less marked this week compared to previous weeks. The fall in the incidence rate was lower in certain age groups, and a trend towards stabilization was observed in certain regions. At the same time, the number of hospital admissions continued to decline.

[A] Fatigue, poor sleep with long COVID
Nearly all long-COVID patients at an Ohio health system reported moderate to severe fatigue, and about half said they had serious sleep disruptions, which were up to 3 times more common in Black participants, according to findings presented this week at the Associated Professional Sleep Societies' annual meeting. The research abstract was published 25 May [2022] in an online supplement of Sleep [see citation below].

Cleveland Clinic researchers parsed data from 962 patients at the health system's COVID-19 clinic who completed the patient-reported outcomes measurement (PROMIS) sleep disturbance and fatigue questionnaires from February to November 2021.

PROMIS scores are standardized to the US adult population on a T-scale, with sleep disturbance and fatigue scores of 60 or higher indicating at least moderate severity, and 70 or higher indicating severe impact.

T-scores among the 682 patients who completed the sleep disturbance questionnaire were, on average, 57.7; 41.2% had at least moderate sleep problems, while 7.3% had severe disruptions. The average fatigue T-score was 63.0; 68.6% had at least moderate fatigue, and 22.6% were severely fatigued.

Relative to patients reporting normal or mildly disturbed sleep, those with moderate or severe impairments had a higher body mass index (BMI) (32.3 vs 30.9 kg/m2), were more likely to be of Black race (40.0 vs 41.0), and had worse scores for generalized anxiety disorder (2.8 vs 1.6) and fatigue (66.7 vs 60.4), regardless of age, sex, or infection severity. After adjustment, Black race was linked to moderate or severe sleep difficulties (odds ratio, 3.42).

In an American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/954920), lead author Cinthya Pena Orbea, MD, said that debilitating sleep problems are very common in long-COVID patients. "Our study suggests that the prevalence of moderate to severe sleep disturbances is high and that Black race confers increased odds to suffer from moderate to severe sleep disturbances, highlighting the importance to further understand race-specific determinants of sleep disturbances in order to develop race-specific interventions," she said.

[B] COVID-19 antibody test
A new microfluidic device directly visualizes SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in vaccinated people, which could help clinicians to time booster doses better, as it measured waning immunity. The test is detailed in Science Advances. [see citation below].

Traditional antibody tests include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and chemiluminescence immunoassay, which are labor-intensive and require laboratories. The new test uses magnetic microparticles (MMPs) to detect antibodies, producing a readout that can be seen in as little as 20 minutes.

During the test, a capillary-driven microfluidic chip is loaded with a solution containing MMPs and polystyrene microparticles that bind to SARS-CoV-2 antibodies simultaneously.

The test was used on 91 vaccinated participants 21-35 days after they received their 2nd dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Participants who had received mRNA vaccines had higher antibody levels than those who had received inactivated vaccines. All volunteers, however, showed a significant decrease in antibody levels at day 45.

The authors, from the University of Hong Kong, said the test could be used as an "immunity passport": a better way to check protection against COVID-19 infection than standard vaccination records.

"Our device is particularly suitable for the general public to routinely check immune protection at local clinics, testing booths at border entry control, or other public sectors, providing a solution for accelerating economic recovery without adding to the medical burden on health-care systems," they concluded.

"Increasing evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 antibody level as a correlate to immune protection, which is useful when choosing vaccine types and monitoring its decay over time. Antibody-based 'immunity passports,' instead of vaccination records alone, might offer a better additional means of evaluation before resuming work, flight travel, or border entry control."

But it still must be determined what level of antibody is protective. - Mod.LK]

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JUNE6WORLD7_1654636996.pdf. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, 8 countries including the USA (114 926), North Korea (61 730), Taiwan (53 010), Argentina (46 045), Brazil (41 353), the UK (33 111), Australia (20 623), and New Zealand (10 378) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 1016 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 4 Jun 2022 to late 5 Jun 2022).

A total of 27 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 8 of the 27 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 0 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 8 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 8.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 19.4%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 52.9% increase in daily reported cases and 17.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.45 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 535.91 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.32 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
