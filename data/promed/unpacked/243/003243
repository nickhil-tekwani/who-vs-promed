Veterinarians and farmers have begun culling at least 2.5 million minks in northern Denmark, after coronavirus was reported in at least 63 farms [see comment for updated numbers].

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration [DVFA] is handling the culling of the infected animals while breeders who have non-infected animals on a farm within 8 km (about 5 mi) of an infected farm must put them to sleep themselves, Flemming Kure Marker of the government agency said.

"We are moving forward, we are getting it done," he said of the culling that started Thursday [8 Oct 2020] in the village of Gjoel, west of Aalborg, adding it could last months, depending on the spread of the virus. There were no immediate figures on how many animals have already been killed.

On Friday [9 Oct 2020], a mink farmer refused to let authorities enter his farm to cull the animals and a padlock had to be cut, police spokesman Henrik Skals told The Associated Press. Over the weekend, a handful of protesters were removed outside 2 mink farms, he added.

The administration said breeders with non-infected minks will get 100% compensation while those with infected animals will receive less as an incentive for farmers to keep the infection out of their herds.

Denmark is among the largest mink exporters in the world and produces an estimate 17 million furs per year. Kopenhagen Fur, a cooperative of 1500 Danish breeders, accounts for 40% of the global mink production. Most of its exports go to China and Hong Kong.

The coronavirus pandemic could "threaten the entire profession," Tage Pedersen, chairman of the Danish Fur Breeders Association, said. "All breeders are right now in a huge amount of uncertainty and frustration over this 'meteor' that has fallen on our heads."

Scientists are still digging into how the minks got infected and if they can spread it to people. Some may have gotten the virus from infected workers. Dutch authorities say some farm workers later caught the virus back from the minks.

In August [2020], the Netherlands brought forward the mandatory end of mink farming by 3 years to 2021 amid a growing number of coronavirus infections at fur farms. In Poland, another large mink fur exporter, the ruling right-wing coalition and the opposition are deeply divided over a new law that would ban fur farms. Opponents say the law will destroy the livelihoods of hundreds of fur farmers.

[When the (continuously updated) DVFA map addressing COVID-19 in minks was accessed yesterday (13 Oct 2020) afternoon, the total number of infected mink holdings in Denmark was 76; their number, 24 hours later (Wed 14 Oct 2020 afternoon), is 89. The virus is circulating in mink farms in 8 municipalities, distributed in 2 of Denmark's 5 main regions, namely, in North Jutland (in 6 municipalities out of 11) and in Mid Jutland (in 2 municipalities out of 19). This is a sharp daily increase that deserves clarification. The map and the said data are available at https://www.foedevarestyrelsen.dk/Leksikon/Sider/Kort-over-screening-af-COVID-19-i-mink.aspx.

The last (4th) OIE update from Denmark on its COVID-19 situation in farmed minks was submitted 1 Oct 2020 (available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Update_4_Letter_to_OIE_on_Sars-CoV-2_in_mink_farms_in_Denmark.pdf). It informed that "in order to mitigate the current situation, additional activities have been initiated, including intensified frequency of sampling (twice a week) of all dead mink in a herd in the relevant municipalities." Such enhanced sampling frequency could have partially contributed to the increased number of reported infected holdings. However, since the number of infected municipalities was, at that point in time, reported to be 2 (Hjorring and Fredeikshavn), there should be other factors behind the spatial spread of the disease in the Danish mink farms located in 8 municipalities. Updated official information on the epidemiology of the disease, the revised control policy, its background and estimated culling figures will be helpful. - Mod.AS
