The following background information on hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in
Canada was extracted from the GIDEON software program:
The first case was reported in 1989.
As of January 1998, 24 cases (7 fatal) had been reported: 15 from Alberta,
6 from British Columbia and 3 from Saskatchewan. The mean patient age was
40.5 years (range 16 to 62); and male/female ratio 2.0/1.
One case was reported in 1989; 1 in 1990; 8 in 1994; 3 in 1995; 3 in 1996;
6 in 1997
Eight cases were reported from Alberta during 1994 to 1996 - all having
been exposed to rodents, including deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_).
The local viruses are Sin Nombre virus in the North, and New York virus in
southern Alberta, Southern Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Convict Creek
virus [thought to be a strain or subtype of Sin Nombre virus - Mod.CHC] was
implicated in a case from Ontario (1997).
