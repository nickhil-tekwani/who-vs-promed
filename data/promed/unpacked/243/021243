A Woodlawn graduate and her family joined an exclusive club recently when they were bitten by a rabid dog in West Monroe [Ouachita Parish, Louisiana] and are now undergoing rabies injections at University Health in Shreveport. [The woman], 43, her children ages 23 and 14, along with her 11-year-old adopted niece, received bites from a female black lab puppy mix that had followed a neighbor home following a morning jog. The family began feeding the stray and it seemed fine for a few days, before it began acting "strangely."

The dog died last week [week ending 5 Oct 2014] in the Ouachita Parish Animal Shelter and was later (necropsied) in Baton Rouge by state officials, who determined it had rabies. [The woman], who is transitioning from West Monroe to Bossier City, and her family will undergo a 3rd round of shots on Friday and Saturday [10 and 11 Oct 2014] at University Health.

Only 5 cases of Louisiana residents being exposed to rabies from a bite by a domesticated pet have been reported in Louisiana since 2007, according to Dr. Gary Balsamo, an epidemiologist with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. "What's unusual about it is -- in Louisiana in the immediate past, we haven't had many dog cases," Balsamo said. "Most of the cases we've had have happened in areas where we have high concentrations of skunk variant rabies. There is a lot of it around Shreveport and a lot of it around Lafayette. Monroe has never really been in the center of that. That's what struck us as unusual." And the West Monroe case is at least the 2nd in the state this year [2014] after a cat near Bogalusa was discovered with the disease in September.

"I just got off the phone with the people at the (Centers for Disease Control) and they said the odds of that happening in the same state in the same year are about one in 1000," Balsamo said. "We just found out that this was a bat variant, which doesn't surprise us, because we know we have bat variance throughout the state. That made sense to us."

[The woman] said that after all 4 family members received bites one morning, she called the Ouachita Parish Animal Control and was told to bring the puppy in for observation. Her friend, who retired from Bossier City animal control after 32 years, captured the dog and secured it in a kennel. "It's been an eye-opening experience, because it's not something you often hear about," [the woman] said. "It's not every day that someone from the CDC calls you asking for help on a case. They've taken a proactive approach in handling this matter."

The incident also has been expensive. [The woman], a regional restaurant supervisor, was told to quarantine her family pet, a Catahoula Cur mix, for 45 days to ensure it wasn't infected. Local and state officials are covering that expense. But the shots that she and her family are receiving cost approximately USD 3200 per person. "My shots were very painful initially, but the 2nd round of shots weren't much different from a flu vaccine," said [the woman], a single mother without health insurance. "It was pretty traumatic."

The good news for the family is that no human in Louisiana has died from rabies exposure within the state since 1953, according to Balsamo. "We did have a gentleman die in 2009 or 2010 who was an immigrant from Mexico, who was exposed there and got sick on a farm here," Balsamo said [2010; see ProMED-mail post 20100825.2992].

But Balsamo added that if humans contract rabies, "they're going to die 99.999 percent of the time. There have been very few to survive. I think the count is like 5 in the world. The advantage with rabies is you can vaccinate after exposure when the disease is incubating." While rabies remains just as prevalent in the wild as it's always been, Balsamo said getting pets vaccinated and local animal control programs have helped keep rabies largely under control for domesticated animals in Louisiana. "The compliance with (vaccination) in the entire state is usually pretty bad," he said. "I think the best in the state is East Baton Rouge Parish and they estimate theirs at 50-60 percent compliance. In some areas, it's probably less than 10 percent."

[We have (Mexican free-tailed) bat rabies throughout the state of Louisiana. I remember when I was a graduate student at Tulane in 1965, a sick rabid bat was picked up in the school's Public Health Department downtown, and I was told to find where it came from. It turned out to be a from bat roost in the roof space of an old slave quarter in the French Quarter in New Orleans. I collected some 21 bats and a number turned out to be virus positive -- as a result of which I was then vaccinated. Skunk rabies came into Louisiana some 15+ years ago via a skunk hopping a lift on a truck out of Texas and dropping off in Lafayette.

The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry has the following admirable advice for keeping pets safe:
"- All dogs, cats and ferrets should be properly vaccinated;
- Ask your veterinarian about what precautions to take if you own a horse;
- Keep vaccinations up to date;
- Avoid stray animals and report strays to local animal control;
- Avoid contact with wildlife, especially skunks and bats, and especially when crepuscular species are about during the day);
- If your dog, cat, ferret or horse is sick, contact a veterinarian." - Mod.MHJ
