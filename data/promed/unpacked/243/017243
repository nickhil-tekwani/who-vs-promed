An outbreak of a hog disease that cannot be treated has hit New
Zealand. Agriculture officials, citing initial tests at a pig farm
where 1/3 of the piglets died, said final DNA results won't be
available for 2 weeks, but other clinical and pathological tests
showed the animals had post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry exotic disease response
coordinator Clifton King said the disease, which usually kills
affected pigs aged 6 to 12 weeks, is widespread outside New Zealand
and Australia. It causes the animals to waste away and is connected
with other pig viruses such as porcine parvovirus. The disease was
identified in the early 1990s and has since been found with
increasing frequency in pig farms in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and
Asia.
Until now, New Zealand and Australia have been among the few
countries that had no cases.
