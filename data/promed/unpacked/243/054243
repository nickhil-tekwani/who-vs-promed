The source of a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_ [O157] in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Ontario was likely lettuce served at KFC/Taco Bell outlets, health officials say. All suspect lettuce has been recalled, they said Friday afternoon, 11 Jan 2013.

"The evidence from our collaborative investigation leads us to believe that the common food source was distributed to this fast-food restaurant chain," said Dr. Frank Atherton, Nova Scotia's deputy chief medical officer of health. "Lettuce has a limited shelf life, and we have not seen a new case in more than a week. This tells us it is highly unlikely the food item remains in the food chain. As an added precaution, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is issuing a recall of the lettuce products."

He added that the fault did not lie with the restaurants, but with FreshPoint, the company that supplied the lettuce. No new cases of _E. coli_ O157 are expected, officials said.

Nova Scotia has had 10 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ O157 in the past couple of weeks. At least 5 are linked to the outbreak. New Brunswick has also had 6 confirmed cases, while Ontario has had 5. All of the patients have been treated and are recovering, Atherton said.

Dr. Eilish Cleary, New Brunswick's chief medical officer, said it was hard to pin down the particular outlet. The lettuce was distributed to other fast-food chains, but the cases were all linked to Taco Bell/KFC. "When we looked at the food history of our patients, they had eaten at several locations, so we were unable to pinpoint exactly which ones they were exposed at," she said.

Sabir Sami, president of KFC/Taco Bell parent company Yum Restaurants, said his company takes the developments seriously. "We're obviously concerned, as this lettuce provided to us by FreshPoint has been distributed to many area restaurants in Canada, including ours," he said in a news release. "We have removed all the affected lettuce from our restaurants in Canada and want to reassure our customers that our food is perfectly safe to eat. The health and safety of our customers is our top priority."

While washing produce with water before use (or in the field with water and/or antibacterial agents such as dilute bleach) is recommended to help remove any dirt, bacteria or residual pesticide, this procedure cannot always be successful in preventing EHEC or other pathogens from causing illness. It is clear that bacteria such as EHEC are able to not only internalize into plants but also survive and multiply (1). The contamination resulting in internalization can occur in seedlings or adult plants and from exposure to roots, stems, or leaves. This observation clearly underscores the need to prevent the initial contamination of the produce at all stages of growth.
