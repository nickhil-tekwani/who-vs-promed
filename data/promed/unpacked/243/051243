Abstract
--------
Background
World Health Organization expert groups recommended mortality trials of 4 repurposed antiviral drugs -- remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a -- in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Methods
We randomly assigned inpatients with COVID-19 equally between one of the trial drug regimens that was locally available and open control (up to 5 options, 4 active and the local standard of care). The intention-to-treat primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each trial drug and its control (drug available but patient assigned to the same care without that drug). Rate ratios for death were calculated with stratification according to age and status regarding mechanical ventilation at trial entry.

Results
At 405 hospitals in 30 countries, 11 330 adults underwent randomization; 2750 were assigned to receive remdesivir, 954 to hydroxychloroquine, 1411 to lopinavir (without interferon), 2063 to interferon (including 651 to interferon plus lopinavir), and 4088 to no trial drug. Adherence was 94 to 96% midway through treatment, with 2 to 6% crossover. In total, 1253 deaths were reported (median day of death, day 8; interquartile range, 4 to 14). The Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 11.8% (39.0% if the patient was already receiving ventilation at randomization and 9.5% otherwise). Death occurred in 301 of 2743 patients receiving remdesivir and in 303 of 2708 receiving its control (rate ratio, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81 to 1.11; P=0.50), in 104 of 947 patients receiving hydroxychloroquine and in 84 of 906 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.59; P=0.23), in 148 of 1399 patients receiving lopinavir and in 146 of 1372 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.25; P=0.97), and in 243 of 2050 patients receiving interferon and in 216 of 2050 receiving its control (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.39; P=0.11). No drug definitely reduced mortality, overall or in any subgroup, or reduced initiation of ventilation or hospitalization duration.

Conclusions
These remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon regimens had little or no effect on hospitalized patients with COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation, and duration of hospital stay.

[From the article above, "In February 2020, a World Health Organization (WHO) research forum on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recommended evaluation of treatments in large, randomized trials, and other WHO expert groups identified 4 repurposed antiviral drugs that might have at least a moderate effect on mortality: remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a. In March 2020, the WHO began a large, simple, international, open-label, randomized trial involving hospital inpatients to evaluate the effects of these 4 drugs on in-hospital mortality. The trial was adaptive; unpromising drugs could be dropped and others added. Hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon were eventually dropped from the trial, but others, such as monoclonal antibodies, will be added." The report above provides interim results for the original 4 drugs.

The Authors conclude, "For each of these 4 repurposed nonspecific antivirals, several thousand patients have now undergone randomization in various trials. The unpromising overall findings from the regimens tested suffice to refute early hopes, based on smaller or nonrandomized studies, that any of these regimens will substantially reduce inpatient mortality, the initiation of mechanical ventilation, or hospitalization duration. Narrower confidence intervals would be helpful (particularly for remdesivir), but the main need is for better treatments."

With successive pandemic waves that continue to have a high morbidity and mortality impact, the search for better regimens to treat cases is ongoing but no magic 'pill or shot' available as yet! - Mod.UBA]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recent announcements that some COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to have high short-term efficacy provide new hope that vaccination will soon contribute to controlling the pandemic. The initial roll-out of limited quantities of vaccines that are still investigational will provide the opportunity to ethically obtain pivotal data to improve regulatory and public health decision making, thereby increasing public and professional confidence in these and other vaccines.

After relatively short follow-up in phase 3 trials, even when vaccine efficacy appears to be high, reliable information will still be needed on longer-term safety and duration of protection. Other information gaps will include more comprehensive assessments of short-term safety, knowledge of whether waning of vaccine-induced protection may lead to vaccine-enhanced disease if a vaccinee becomes infected on exposure to SARS-CoV-2, information on protection against clinically severe forms of COVID-19, and knowledge of any associations between the degree of protection and the recipient's age or coexisting conditions. Even after the 1st vaccines become available, it will still be important to evaluate additional vaccines to meet worldwide needs.[1]

On [6 Nov 2020], we, as participants in a World Health Organization (WHO) ad hoc consultation on the next steps for COVID-19 vaccine evaluation, discussed what critical additional data should be sought to inform regulatory and policy recommendations for the 1st successful vaccines and subsequent optimization. Consensus emerged that while it is still feasible and ethical, ongoing studies and others that are about to start should continue to collect high-quality information using directly randomized comparisons against placebo to address as many of the data requirements as possible. While vaccine supplies are limited, available vaccines are still investigational, or public health recommendations to use those vaccines have not been made, we believe it is ethically appropriate to continue blinded follow-up of placebo recipients in existing trials and to randomly assign new participants to vaccine or placebo. Moreover, under these conditions, we believe that trial sponsors are not ethically obligated to unblind treatment assignments for participants who desire to obtain a different investigational vaccine. People who enroll in clinical trials for altruistic reasons would probably understand the value of gathering data that will further elucidate the safety and efficacy of these vaccines and their appropriate use.

Conversely, there was concern that observational data obtained from nonrandomized studies after vaccine deployment could yield unreliable answers. Observational studies are subject to substantial biases and are much less amenable to unambiguous interpretation. Their limitations are of particular concern during this public health emergency, because vaccinated and unvaccinated people will differ in their risk of exposure to infection and of serious disease, partly because of fluctuating attack rates and because during early phases of vaccine deployment, vaccinees may well be at particular risk of infection. In these circumstances, even carefully analyzed observational studies can yield misleading answers about safety and efficacy.[2,3] In addition, unrelated events that occur by chance after vaccination may be incorrectly attributed to the vaccine, and such anecdotes may be deliberately promulgated by groups opposed to vaccination.

Large, placebo-controlled, phase 3 efficacy trials could provide much of the needed information if they have appropriately prolonged follow-up while random assignments are still blinded. Such continuation would yield unbiased evidence on the duration of protection and on longer-term safety, including assessment of any evidence of the vaccine eventually enhancing the risk of severe disease (as was recently detected by continued follow-up of placebo recipients in dengue vaccine studies [4]). If there are hazards, they need to be identified; conversely, longer follow-up might reassuringly demonstrate continued protection with few or no adverse consequences, reducing vaccine hesitancy.

This opportunity to obtain reliable evidence about longer-term effects would be destroyed by early unblinding and immediate vaccination of participants assigned to placebo. Although each participant has the option to pursue any available intervention, if substantial numbers of participants choose not to do so, continuation of blinded follow-up in a population in which no licensed vaccine is being deployed could yield important and unexpected findings that would be difficult to obtain reliably any other way.

Thus, early deployment of scarce doses of still-investigational vaccines (under Emergency Use Listing [EUL] or similar regulatory mechanisms) could bring additional public health benefits if accompanied by firm commitments to maintaining blinded follow-up of participants in ongoing or future placebo-controlled trials until a licensed vaccine is fully deployed in the population. In some settings, early deployment could instead use the Expanded Access/Compassionate Use (EA/CU) mechanism, under which recipients are unambiguously informed of the vaccine's investigational nature. For example, under trying conditions, the WHO deployed an Ebola vaccine under EA/CU during the recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, ensuring that hundreds of thousands of prioritized persons received an investigational vaccine that was in limited supply.[4]

Because hundreds of millions of people in some priority groups will eventually be vaccinated against COVID-19, the world needs highly reliable evidence of vaccine safety that can be straightforwardly and convincingly explained to the public. Indeed, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 vaccines in a population may depend more on the prevalence of hesitancy or strong disinclination to receive a COVID-19 vaccine than on whether the vaccine has 95%, 80%, or 70% efficacy. Current phase 3 studies typically provide controlled data on about 20 000 vaccine recipients and 20 000 placebo recipients. Although these numbers should suffice for detecting relatively common adverse events, there is a risk of missing or exaggerating less common but clinically important events. Because large numbers of people will rapidly be vaccinated, vaccination will inevitably seem to be temporally associated with some uncommon adverse events. A large, simple trial [5] to evaluate serious safety outcomes, in which many participants (even hundreds of thousands) are randomly assigned to vaccine or placebo and those who receive placebo are vaccinated only about 2 months later could identify any rare but serious short-term side effects or show that there were none. Such a trial could be conducted either during a period of emergency use or immediately after licensure and could be viewed as a fair way of allocating initially limited vaccine supplies.

What about vaccine candidates that do not become available for phase 3 study until after effective vaccines have already been deployed in some locations? Additional vaccines with worthwhile efficacy would still be desirable, especially if they could be readily deployed on a large scale or if safety concerns emerge with the 1st vaccines. For example, a 70% effective single-dose vaccine may be more valuable than a 2-dose regimen with 90% efficacy and greater implementation challenges. It is noteworthy that such a vaccine could not be identified without using placebo controls. Participants in trials of such vaccines should have access to the standard of care in their location [3] and, if the trial is successful, their communities should share in the benefit. Countries with limited or no access to a known effective vaccine could thus ethically permit placebo-controlled trials of vaccines of potential relevance to them even if effective vaccines were already being marketed elsewhere.

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are the bedrock of modern clinical decision making and remain the most efficient way to obtain reliable results. If successful, focused attempts to ascertain correlates of protection could materially accelerate acceptance of 2nd-generation vaccines but alone cannot provide an adequate basis for assessing safety and efficacy. Early clinical trial results may offer promise, but they cannot provide all the reliable data required. Randomized, noninferiority trials can provide clinically relevant data in some cases, but at a considerable cost to efficiency.

We can address important needs with continued follow-up of placebo recipients in phase 3 trials, use of placebo controls in large, simple safety trials, and clinical data from placebo-controlled, randomized trials evaluating new vaccines. A concerted global effort to collect such data while it's still possible would increase the likelihood of reliably identifying multiple vaccines with favorable benefit-risk profiles. These studies would go far toward earning the broad public confidence required for widespread vaccine acceptance so that we can bring this pandemic to an end.

As ProMED has reported in numerous posts, the earlier challenges of having good enough vaccine candidates have been surmounted, many have cleared, or are in the final stages of human trials. Yet the mechanisms of producing and distributing these vaccines at the global scale with the ongoing logistics hurdles due to the pandemic remain to be determined.

The paper above mentions pertinent concerns of rolling out vaccines on a trial basis without an understanding of the medium to long term impact of the vaccines, citing "Current phase 3 studies typically provide controlled data on about 20 000 vaccine recipients and 20 000 placebo recipients. Although these numbers should suffice for detecting relatively common adverse events, there is a risk of missing or exaggerating less common but clinically important events. Because large numbers of people will rapidly be vaccinated, vaccination will inevitably seem to be temporally associated with some uncommon adverse events." This could potentially lead to increased hesitancy among the recipient populations; the infodemic on the vaccine roll out is already happening on social media....

The authors observe quite aptly, "Because hundreds of millions of people in some priority groups will eventually be vaccinated against COVID-19, the world needs highly reliable evidence of vaccine safety that can be straightforwardly and convincingly explained to the public. Indeed, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 vaccines in a population may depend more on the prevalence of hesitancy or strong disinclination to receive a COVID-19 vaccine than on whether the vaccine has 95%, 80%, or 70% efficacy." More work needs to be done. Ethical dilemmas associated with double blind vaccine trials are another dimension to be considered, in which a healthy volunteer participates in a vaccine trial and ends up receiving a placebo. - Mod.UBA

[3] FDA approval of remdesivir

ref: Rubin D, Chan-Tack K, Farley J, Sherwat A. FDA approval of remdesivir -- A step in the right direction. N Engl J Med. 2020; doi: 10.1056/NEJMp2032369. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33264539
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [31 Jan 2020], the US secretary of health and human services declared a public health emergency in response to COVID-19. This disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, can have severe manifestations, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and death. Although there is now an extensive global search for therapies, there remains an unmet need for safe and effective treatment options for patients.

On [1 May 2020], on the basis of preliminary results from phase 3 trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow the use of remdesivir for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients hospitalized with severe disease.[1] The scope of the EUA was subsequently expanded on [28 Aug 2020], to allow use in a broader hospitalized population. On [22 Oct 2020], the FDA approved remdesivir for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age or older and weighing at least 40 kg [88 lb]) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.[2]

This approval was based largely on the results of three phase 3 clinical trials in hospitalized patients with disease of varying severity. These were the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-1) sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the supportive trials GS-US-540-5774 and GS-US-540-5773 sponsored by Gilead Sciences. ACTT-1, which had a rigorous design, provided the most compelling evidence of efficacy.

ACTT-1 was a phase 3, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in hospitalized patients with mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19.[3] A total of 1062 eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive remdesivir or placebo for up to 10 days. The primary efficacy end point was time to recovery through day 29. In the overall population, the median time to recovery was 10 days in the remdesivir group as compared with 15 days in the placebo group (recovery rate ratio, 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12 to 1.49; P less than 0.001). The predefined key secondary end point of odds of clinical improvement at day 15, based on an 8-category ordinal scale, also significantly favored remdesivir over placebo (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.91). The 29-day mortality was 11% in the remdesivir group, as compared with 15% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03) -- a result that left uncertainty about whether remdesivir provides a survival benefit in addition to accelerating time to recovery.

GS-US-540-5774 was a phase 3, multinational, 1:1:1 randomized, open-label trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 5 days of remdesivir, 10 days of remdesivir, and standard of care in 584 hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19.4 The primary efficacy end point was clinical status on day 11, assessed on a seven-category ordinal scale. The odds of improvement on the ordinal scale were higher in the 5-day remdesivir group at day 11 than in the group receiving the standard of care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.48; P=0.02). The odds of improvement in clinical status did not differ significantly between the 10-day remdesivir group and the standard-of-care group (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.95).

GS-US-540-5773 was a phase 3, multinational, 1:1 randomized, open-label trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 5 days as compared with 10 days of remdesivir in 397 hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.5 The primary efficacy end point was clinical status assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale on day 14. After adjustment for baseline differences between groups, clinical status at day 14 did not differ significantly between patients assigned to 5-day and 10-day courses of remdesivir (odds ratio for improvement, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.12), with no differences in recovery or mortality rates. Overall, results in this trial were suggestive of similar treatment effects with 5-day and 10-day regimens in this patient population.

The main limitations of the Gilead-sponsored trials included their open-label design and the lack of a standard-of-care group in GS-US-540-5773. It is possible that the open-label design contributed to the differences in outcomes in these trials, specifically, a numerical difference favoring the 5-day remdesivir group over the 10-day remdesivir group in both trials. In GS-US-540-5773, virtually all patients in the 5-day group received 5 days of therapy or less, whereas nearly half of patients in the 10-day group received the full 10 days of therapy; similarly, in GS-US-540-5774, virtually all patients in the 5-day group received 5 days of therapy or less, whereas more than a third of patients in the 10-day group received the full 10 days of therapy. Hence, discharge decisions may have been influenced by the patients' assigned durations of intravenous therapy, which potentially affected results on the ordinal scale that ranged from 1 (not hospitalized) to 7 (death). The limitations of these trials led to uncertainty with respect to the optimal duration of treatment for hospitalized patients.

The FDA is aware of the recent preprint from the Solidarity trial, a large, open-label, simple, randomized trial that included a comparison of remdesivir with the standard of care in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [see item [1] above]. That trial's primary objective was to assess in-hospital mortality, and it did not find a statistically significant difference in mortality between the remdesivir and standard-of-care groups. This finding is not inconsistent with ACTT-1, which also did not establish a mortality difference between remdesivir and placebo. However, ACTT-1 did demonstrate robust results on time to recovery and odds of clinical improvement in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, whereas Solidarity was not designed to rigorously assess these end points.

The major safety signals identified in the FDA review included hepatotoxicity (manifested as an elevation in aminotransferase levels and associated with duration of administration) and hypersensitivity reactions, both of which are described in the prescribing information for remdesivir. The FDA considered the safety profile for remdesivir acceptable for the indicated patient population (that is, adults and certain pediatric patients requiring hospitalization for treatment of COVID-19). Postmarketing pharmacovigilance will be important in further defining the safety profile of remdesivir.

The approval of a new drug product under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires substantial evidence of effectiveness and a demonstration of safety for the drug's intended use or uses. In considering approval of a drug, the FDA conducts a benefit-risk assessment based on rigorous scientific standards to ensure that the product's benefits outweigh its risks for the intended population. For remdesivir, this assessment included review by a multidisciplinary team that comprehensively assessed safety, efficacy, and product quality, including independent analyses of data from the clinical trials. Confirmation of data integrity was also an integral part of the review and included inspections of selected clinical trial sites as well as the clinical trial sponsors.

Given the unmet medical need for safe and effective therapeutics for COVID-19, the FDA used several mechanisms to facilitate product development and expedite the review of the new drug application (NDA) for remdesivir. These included granting a fast-track designation, which increases opportunities for a sponsor to engage with the FDA, and granting a rolling review as part of the fast-track process, which allows a sponsor to submit, and the FDA to review, sections of the NDA as they arrive. The NDA also received a priority review designation, which places the review on an expedited timeline. These mechanisms enabled a comprehensive review to be completed less than 3 months after the last component of the NDA was submitted.

There remains uncertainty surrounding the optimal dosing of remdesivir in pediatric patients, pregnant patients, and patients with renal or hepatic impairment. These uncertainties result, in part, from the important public health priority of expediting the development and review of a safe and effective therapeutic agent in the setting of an unmet medical need and will be addressed through postmarketing requirements and postmarketing commitments.

The approval of remdesivir marked an important step toward addressing the needs of patients with Covid-19. Nonetheless, the absence of a demonstrated survival benefit highlights the need for continued therapeutic development.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 2 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC2_1607019190.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 42.7% of daily case numbers and 25.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 26.8 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Chile, and Peru. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Ecuador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Puerto Rico.

- The European region reported 38.3% of daily case numbers and 58.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 19.05 million. Countries not reporting cases today (2 Dec 2020) include Israel, and Kazakhstan. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Germany, and Ukraine. There are 27 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.9% of daily case numbers and 7.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.14 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, and the UAE. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Tunisia, Sudan, Yemen, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.51 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Angola, and Benin.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.63% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.89 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Guam, French Polynesia, China, and Mongolia.

- The South East Asia region reported 9.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.8 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, Malaysia has overtaken Japan as the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy maintains dominance in the European region, although France has the highest cumulative case count. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.
