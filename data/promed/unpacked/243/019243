Rabies kills 74 people in northern Mountainous Provinces of Viet Nam
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabies has claimed the lives of 74 people in the northern mountainous provinces so far this year [2012], but only 83 percent of deaths were reported. According to the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, after 5 straight years of reductions, the number of rabies cases rose sharply this year, spreading across the northern mountainous region.

Up to 96 percent of rabies cases in humans can be traced back to unvaccinated dogs, while public awareness of rabies and its preventive measures remains low.

Rabies, caused by a virus transmitted through an animal bite, has the 2nd highest fatality rate among infectious diseases in Viet Nam.

[Previously, in mid-July 2012, it was reported that in the northern mountainous provinces of Son La, Lai Chau, Dien Bien, Lao Cai, and Yen Bai about 200 people had experienced dog bites and 16 people had died as a result. The above report indicates that there has been no improvement in the situation. The Health authorities in Viet Nam attribute the very high deaths rates to the mountainous terrain making it difficult to carry out systematic canine vaccination, and to a lack awareness of the local population in these remote areas.
