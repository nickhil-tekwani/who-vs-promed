Viet Nam: Veterinarian is Suspected Case of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
A Vietnamese veterinarian has just been hospitalized on suspicion of having
contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection, according to the local
newspaper Pioneer on Thu 10 Mar 2005. The patient, a woman from Vietnam's
northern Thai Binh province, was admitted to the Institute of Tropical
Diseases in Hanoi city on Wed 9 Mar 2005. She has frequently had contact
with poultry, including infected fowl.
In the most recent outbreak of avian influenza starting in late December
2004, Viet Nam has reported 24 human cases of avian influenza, of whom 13
have died. The country does not recognize [i.e. disputes] the recent
re-testing by a lab in Japan, which indicated that specimens from 7
Vietnamese people had tested positive for the virus, not negative, as
testing by Viet Nam's Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute in January 2005.
The same specimens had tested negative to H5N1 virus, the Institute said,
adding that all of the 7 people are still alive.
To prevent new outbreaks of avian influenza, Viet Nam will vaccinate duck
flocks in the southern Mekong Delta in April, the country's Institute for
Veterinary Research said, noting that they will use avian influenza
vaccines imported from China and the Netherlands. [The outbreak of] avian
influenza, which has killed and led to the forced culling of more than 1.5
million fowl in 35 cities and provinces in Viet Nam since January, is
subsiding. By Wed 9 Mar 2005, 20 out of the 35 localities have detected no
new bird flu-affected spots for at least 3 weeks.
[If confirmed, this report records a significant case of transmission of
avian influenza to a person whose occupation involves frequent exposure to
diseased fowl. However, the report also adds some confusion to the
epidemiological situation by disputing the results of tests claimed to have
greater sensitivity carried out in Japan. Further information is awaited. -

Viet Nam: Relatives of Avian Flu Patients Are Asymptomatic Cases
--------------------------------------------------
2 relatives of avian influenza patients in northern Vietnam have tested
positive for the virus without being sick, according to reports from
Vietnam today. [9 Mar 2005]. The 61-year-old widow of a man who died of
avian flu in late February and the 80-year-old grandfather of 2 patients
currently under treatment in a hospital have tested positive, the
Associated Press and other news services reported. Both are apparently
healthy. Both people live in Thai Binh province, where 5 other avian flu
cases have been reported in the past 2 weeks. Nguyen Tran Hien, Director of
the National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi, confirmed
that the 61-year-old woman had tested positive for the H5N1 virus. The
Director of a district medical center in Thai Binh, Nguyen Van Thieu, said
the woman remained in good health but was isolated at home, the story said.
Her 69-year-old husband fell ill 19 Feb 2005 and died on 23 Feb, Thieu
said. He said the family had raised some chickens, but they remained
healthy, and the source of the woman's infection was unclear.
The 80-year-old is the grandfather of a 21-year-old man and a 14-year-old
girl who have avian flu. The young man has been in critical condition for 2
weeks, while the girl is in good condition though still hospitalized.
Testing completed yesterday at the National Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology showed that the grandfather had the H5N1 virus, according to
Pham Van Diu, Director of the province's Preventive Medicine Center. Diu
said the man was at home and in good health.
A Reuters report today quoted health officials in the man's village as
saying he had drunk raw duck blood during the Lunar New Year festivities in
February. But an Agence France Presse report said it was unclear whether he
had caught the virus from infected poultry or from his grandchildren. None
of 12 other relatives tested positive for the virus, according to an
Associated Press reporter.
The 2 new cases are not the 1st sign that people can contract the H5N1
virus without getting ill or seriously ill. Mild and asymptomatic cases
were seen when the virus 1st jumped to humans in Hong Kong in 1997, Dick
Thompson, infectious disease spokesman for the World Health Organization
(WHO) in Geneva, told CIDRAP News via e-mail today. (6 of 18 people
infected in that outbreak died.)
In addition, a Japanese man was found to have been infected while working
at a farm where a poultry outbreak of H5N1 avian flu occurred in February
2003, though he never got sick, according to news reports in December 2004.
The confirmation of asymptomatic cases implies that infections may be more
common than previously thought and that the case-fatality rate may be
lower. The fatality rate for officially confirmed cases has hovered in the
70 percent range. Thompson commented, "The CFR [case-fatality rate] had to
be overstated. The cases we were sure of were those which were sick enough
to go to a hospital and these extreme cases have very poor outcomes. Surely
others were infected and either not getting sick or not getting sick enough
to seek treatment at a hospital. Factoring those into the CFR has been
impossible. We simply don't know the denominator."
Dr. Arlene King of the Public Health Agency of Canada told CIDRAP News that
researchers in Asia have conducted serologic surveys in an effort to find
asymptomatic cases, but full results have not been released yet. In a
newspaper report yesterday, she said, the WHO's Peter Horby reported that a
serologic survey of Asian health-care workers who had cared for avian flu
patients found no evidence of infection among the workers. King is Director
of the agency's Immunization and Respiratory Infections Division in Ottawa.
King said mild and asymptomatic cases of avian flu could go undetected even
if people are tested, depending on test sensitivity. "The sensitivity of
tests may be higher in sick patients," she said. "If you're swabbing
patients who are less sick, maybe your tests are less sensitive."
If avian flu cases are more common than suspected, it raises the question
whether the virus has more opportunities to mix, or "re-assort," with
human-adapted flu viruses. Reassortment could lead to a mutated virus that
could spread easily from person to person, potentially triggering a flu
pandemic in a world population with little or no resistance to the virus.
Thompson said the WHO is assessing the implications of asymptomatic cases
for viral reassortment. "We hope to have something soon," he wrote. King
commented, "I think we know so little about the conditions in which
[reassortment] occurs that it's really difficult to speculate on that."
King said it would not surprise her if the 2 latest cases are found to
involve person-to-person transmission, given that some possible cases of
human transmission have been seen previously in the past year. "The 2
settings you're going to see [cases involving human transmission] in are
households and health-care settings, because that's where infection gets
amplified," she said.
Several family clusters of cases have occurred since H5N1 avian flu began
spreading in Southeast Asia in late 2003, but human-to-human transmission
has been described as probable in only one instance so far. Researchers
concluded that the mother and an aunt of an 11-year-old girl probably
acquired the virus from her when they cared for her in a hospital in
Thailand in September 2004.

[This report contains the 1st, albeit preliminary, results of determination
of the seroprevalence of anti-H5N1 antibodies in asymptomatic persons
occupationally exposed to avian influenza virus infection. The data suggest
that the frequency may be low.
