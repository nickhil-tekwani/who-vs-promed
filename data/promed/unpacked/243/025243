Meningitis in the WHO African Region Update, January-April 1997:
In Togo, the epidemic of cerebrospinal meningitis is completely over.
The weekly number of reported cases in Burkina Faso, the Gambia, Ghana
and Mali has steadily decreased since the thirteenth week of 1997, and
it is hoped that with the immunization activities being carried out and
the recent rain in most affected areas, the epidemic may soon be under
control.
This report includes a Table showing the cumulative number of
cases/deaths notified from 1 January to 28 April 1997.
