The district of Dueren [North Rhine-Westphalia] has announced that 42 patients had been treated within a few weeks treated for a certain form of community-acquired pneumonia in Juelich hospital; legionellosis was determined to be the cause in 5 of 9 cases examined. Authorities under pressure are now investigating the source of the pathogen.

_Legionella pneumophila_ [the cause of legionnaires' disease] can cause high fever and pneumonia, if, for example, contaminated water vapor is inhaled while showering and thus reaches the lungs. The pathogens multiply [in the hot water pipes of a building's plumbing system]. Infection in swimming pools is also possible. [As at 2005, no recorded outbreak of legionnaires' disease has been directly associated with bathing in swimming pools (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/legionella.pdf).]

_Legionella_ are not transmitted from person to person. Even when eating and drinking, there is no risk of infection, [says] the Bavarian State Office for Health with on its website. [Aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated tap water may be the source for _Legionella_ pneumonia in people prone to aspirate (http://legionella.org/media/14950/cab.pdf) and neonates born in birthing pools (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/alert-after-legionnaires-disease-case-in-baby).] Particularly at risk for severe disease are people with weakened immune systems, the elderly, and smokers.

The source of the _Legionella_ in the district of Dueren is still unknown. So far, the pathogens were detected in 5 cases with special microbiological tests, which have been carried out by the health department. The authorities were responding to a cluster of pneumonia cases in Juelich. In the period from 14 Aug to 11 Sep 2014, 42 people were treated in hospitals for a certain type of pneumonia. In 2 of the affected the lung inflammation led to death. However, no investigation has been conducted for _Legionella_ in these 2 cases. In 5 of 9 subjects tested, a _Legionella_ infection was confirmed.

The district of Dueren also announced that the National Center for Health (LGZ) is involved. Currently, patients are asked about their whereabouts to help identify the source of pathogens. "Since the incubation period is usually 2 to 10 days, 1st infections may have taken place on [4 Aug 2014]. In the last of these cases infection took place before [10 Sep 2014]," said a statement from the district. "Whether more cases will be reported in the future, cannot be excluded."

After last year [2013] in Warstein [North Rhine-Westphalia] 160 people were infected with _Legionella_, which probably came from an industrial cooling system, the district of Dueren made it mandatory in for all operators of cooling plants in the city of Juelich to register. [The outbreak in Warstein was posted last year by ProMED-mail (Legionellosis - Germany: (NW) fatal, cooling tower susp. 20130905.1926123).]
