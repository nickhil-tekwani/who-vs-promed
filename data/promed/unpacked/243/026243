In a study published online by the journal Annals of Internal
Medicine [Emergence of Multidrug-Resistant, Community-Associated,
Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ Clone USA300 in Men Who
Have Sex with Men
<http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/0000605-200802190-00204v1>],
the bacteria [multidrug-resistant MRSA clone US300] seemed to be
spread most easily through anal intercourse but also through casual
skin-to-skin contact and touching contaminated surfaces. The authors
warned that unless microbiology laboratories were able to identify
the strain and doctors prescribed the proper antibiotic therapy, the
infection could soon spread among other groups and become a wider threat.

The new strain seems to have "spread rapidly" in gay populations in
San Francisco and Boston, the researchers wrote, and "has the
potential for rapid, nationwide dissemination" among gay men. The
study was based on a review of medical records from outpatient
clinics in San Francisco and Boston and 9 medical centers in San Francisco.

The Castro district in San Francisco has the highest number of gay
residents in the country, according to the University of California,
San Francisco. One in 588 residents is infected with the new
multidrug-resistant MRSA strain, the study found. That compares with
1 in 3800 people in San Francisco, according to statistical analyses
based on ZIP codes. A separate part of the study found that gay men
in San Francisco were about 13 times more likely to be infected than
other people in the city. The San Francisco researchers suggested
that scrubbing with soap and water might be the most effective way to
stop skin-to-skin transmission, particularly after sexual activities.

MRSA, for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, was once
spread chiefly in hospitals. But in recent years, a number of healthy
people have acquired it outside hospitals. Nearly 19 000 people died
in the United States from MRSA infections in 2005, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention has reported. The infection can cause
unusually severe problems, including abscesses and skin ulcers. The
bacteria can invade through the skin to produce necrotizing
fasciitis, giving them the popular name of flesh-eating bacteria.
They can also cause pneumonia, damage the heart and produce
widespread infection through the blood.

Among gay men in the study, MRSA was spread by skin contact, causing
abscesses and infection in the buttocks and genital area. The new
strain is closely related to earlier ones. Both are known as MRSA
USA300. The strain is much more difficult to treat because it is
resistant not just to methicillin, but also many more of the
antibiotics used to treat the earlier strains, said Dr. Henry F.
Chambers, an author of the new study. The new strain contains a
plasmid called pUSA03.

"This particular clone is resistant to at least 3 other drugs,
clindamycin, tetracycline and mupirocin," Dr. Chambers said in a
telephone interview. Of the alternatives recommended by the C.D.C.
and the Infectious Diseases Society of America,
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), clindamycin and a
tetracycline, "this strain is resistant to 2 of those 3," he added.
"In addition, the new strain is resistant to mupirocin, which has
been advocated for eradicating the strain from carriers."

[Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is a type of
_S. aureus_ that is resistant to antibiotics called beta-lactams,
which include methicillin, oxacillin, and other more common
antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. MRSA
have been causing infections acquired in a healthcare facility, such
as a hospital, long-term care facility (e.g., nursing home), or
hemodialysis unit for more than 40 years. Most healthcare-associated
MRSA (HA-MRSA) are also resistant to multiple other classes of
antibiotics than include the macrolides (e.g., erythromycin),
fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin), and clindamycin. HA-MRSA are
usually sensitive to vancomycin, daptomycin, and linezolid; and are
also likely sensitive to the tetracyclines and
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. While 25 percent to 30 percent of the
healthy population carry _S. aureus_ in their nose and on skin, they
infrequently carry HA-MRSA.

The appearance of MRSA in infections acquired outside healthcare
settings is a more recent problem. Community-Associated MRSA
(CA-MRSA) strains have been generally susceptible to a wider range of
antibiotics, other than beta-lactams (e.g., fluoroquinolones and
clindamycin). Most CA-MRSA carry a specific type of genetic element
that encodes methicillin-resistance (staphylococcal chromosomal
cassette Type IV), whereas HA-MRSA carry Types I, II, and III. Many
CA-MRSA carry genes that encode Panton-Valentine leukocidin, a toxin
that predisposes to severe skin and soft-tissue infections and
necrotizing pneumonia.

Unlike HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA often cause infection in children and adults
without any obvious risk factors. Clusters of CA-MRSA skin infections
have been documented among athletes participating in contact sports,
military recruits, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, Native
Americans, men who have sex with men, IV drug users, and prisoners.
Factors that have been associated with the spread of CA-MRSA skin
infections in otherwise healthy people include close skin-to-skin
contact, skin cuts or abrasions, contact with contaminated surfaces
(e.g., gym equipment, shared towels), and poor hygiene.

The CDC classifies MRSA isolates into pulsed-field types (currently
USA100-1200) based on genetic relatedness (McDougal, L. et al.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of oxacillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates from the United States: Establishing
a national database. J Clin Microbiol. 2003;41:5113-20). USA300, the
predominant epidemic clone in numerous outbreaks in the United
States, is also increasingly seen in Canada and Europe. International
travel and the increasing trend of training or working abroad among
health care workers probably is contributing to its global spread
(Tietz et al. Transatlantic spread of the USA300 clone of MRSA. NEJM
2005 353:532-533). USA300 has been implicated in skin and soft tissue
infections, as well as invasive disease, including septicemia,
necrotizing pneumonia, and necrotizing fasciitis.

More recently, some CA-MRSA USA300 have accumulated multiple drug
resistance genes resulting in resistance not only to beta-lactam
antibiotics, but also resistance to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline,
macrolides, clindamycin, and mupirocin (Diep et al. Lancet 2006;
367:731-9). Spread of multidrug-resistant USA300 limits options both
for oral therapy and for use of mupirocin topically to eradicate MRSA
carrier state during CA-MRSA outbreaks. Because genes that determine
resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and mupirocin
are plasmid-mediated, they could spread quickly. In 2006 and 2007,
clusters of infection due to multidrug-resistant CA_MRSA were
reported among gay men in San Francisco and Boston (Carleton,
Perdreau-Remington. 46th ICAAC. San Francisco, CA. September 27-30,
2006. Abstract C2-1142; Han et al. J Clin Microbiol 2007; 45:1350-2).

The above New York Times news release refers to a recent publication
in the Annals of Internal Medicine by the same San Francisco and
Boston investigators that further characterizes the epidemiology
of multidrug-resistant USA300 infection among men who have sex with
men. The MRSA clone USA300 infection of the buttocks, genitals and
perineum suggested transmission by skin-to-skin contact during anal
intercourse; however the evidence remains circumstantial, since
specific sexual practices were not assessed systematically in this
retrospective study. The investigators postulated that spread of the
MRSA clone USA300 between the Boston and San Francisco outbreaks
could have been facilitated by an infected man who had sex with men
and who travel frequently between the two cities.

The investigators cited another recent study that reported CA-MRSA
clone USA300 infections of the buttocks and genito-perineal area in
heterosexual partners (Cook et al. Clin Infect Dis 2007; 44:410-3)
and an on-line reader response to the Diep et al. publication
questioned if this could be also attributed to heterosexual practice
of anal intercourse. - Mod.ML]
