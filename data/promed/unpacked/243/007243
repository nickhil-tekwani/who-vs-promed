[We are reporting this disease event even though it occurred in March
2007. First of all, late reporting, even if severely delayed by the
reporting country like this, is better than none at all. Furthermore,
it confirms events we have previously reported and which are
referenced below. Finally, there is no indication of wild boar
exposure or any other particular epidemiologic pattern, and the
apparent case fatality rate was 100 percent, much higher than the 40
percent in the other recent Russian outbreak in Krasnodar reported on
22 Feb 2007; see OIE Disease Information Vol 20 - No 8, 22 Feb 2007 at
