Several persons bitten by rabid otter: Request for information
------------------------------------------------------------
About three weeks ago [circa 30 Apr 2007] several persons were bitten
by an otter in a affluent gated community in Vero Beach, FL. The
community has a golf course and numerous ponds with extensive
landscaping. The otter was rabies positive. At least one person has
received the 2 vaccines. Interestingly no notice has been give in the
press about this. I had not heard of otters being infected, but of
course there's no reason they could not be. Further information is requested.

[According to Potter, et al., in Wilderness Environ Med. 2007
Spring;18(1):41-4, as a result of the successful restoration and
conservation programs deployed by state and federal agencies,
populations of the North American river otter (_Lontra canadensis_)
are increasing in many states. Recreational activities such as
swimming, boating, and fishing increase the likelihood of human
interactions with this mustelid. Otters tend to avoid areas of high
human activity, and occur at low population densities. Therefore,
interactions with humans are rare, and aggressive encounters by
otters are even less frequent. Any aggressive and unprovoked attack
may be indicative of rabies virus infection. The Florida Department
of Health website lists a single identification of an rabid otter in
Sumter county during the period Jan - Mar 2007
(<http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/community/rabies/Data/2007/RabiestableMar2007.pdf>).
Sumter county is in the northwestern part of central Florida (map at
<http://www.doh.state.fl.us/environment/community/rabies/Maps/2007/2007YTD_Rabies_March.pdf>)
whereas Vero Beach, the site of the current attack is further east.
Information on the so-far unrecorded incident at Vero Beach is being
sought. - Mods.MPP/CP]
