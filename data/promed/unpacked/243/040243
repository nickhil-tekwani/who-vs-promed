[According to the End Polio Pakistan website, there has been a newly confirmed case of polio reported in Sindh province.

The addition of this new case brings the total number of cases reported from Pakistan since 1 Jan 2019 to 12, and in Sindh to 2, one in Larkana district, and one in Karachi district [previously reported]. (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019. - Mod.MPP]

[The addition of this case will bring the global total of WPV associated polio since 1 Jan 2019 to 19. I am presuming that this case is associated with infection with WPV1 as those have been the cases currently reported on the End Polio Pakistan website.

Details on this newly reported case are not presently available (having tried searching the media). More information on this case including age, gender, vaccination history and other relevant epidemiologic parameters would be greatly appreciated.

A map showing the districts and provinces of Pakistan can be found at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf. Larkana district is located in the northern portion of Sindh, not far from the border with Balochistan province where there are significant pockets of unvaccinated individuals. Larkana has been in the news in recent days due to an apparent major increase in HIV infections identified in the district and the accusation that a local doctor has been responsible for infecting patients (https://tribune.com.pk/story/1967184/1-30-new-hiv-positive-cases-surface-hyderabad/), which may have overshadowed the current news cycle.
