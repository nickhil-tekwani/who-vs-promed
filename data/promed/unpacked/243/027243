Following an annual one week flower exhibition from 19-28 February 1999 in
the northwest of the Netherlands (Bovenkarspel) with over 80 000 visitors,
at least 26 people have been admitted in hospitals in the province of
North Holland with severe legionella pneumonia. Two persons died.*

After a public alarm for the whole country on Friday evening 13 Mar 1999
several other cases, including some deaths, were reported to us.
The installation of stands and equipment on the exhibition grounds started
from 12 Feb 1999. The exhibition normally has many international visitors.
As the theme of this year's exhibition was Russia, many people from the
former USSR have visited the exhibition grounds, from the onset of the
preparations. [Also as in previous years, many visitors from Indonesia
were present.

legionellosis with onset of disease in the period from 12 Feb 1999 to 12
Mar 1999 in people that visited or worked at the exhibition grounds.

laboratory confirmation of legionellosis or any other specific causative
microorganism), with onset of disease in the period from 12 Feb 1999 to 12
Mar 1999 in people that visited or worked at the exhibition grounds.
Possible case: clinical atypical pneumonia e.c.i. (without laboratory
confirmation of legionellosis or any other specific causative
microorganism) with onset of disease in the period from 12 Feb 1999 to 12

Several new cases of the potentially fatal Legionnaires' disease were
contracted over the weekend and a third victim died from the illness, the
Dutch Health Ministry said Monday.
"We are trying to take inventory of all those who have been affected by
the bacteria, but it's hard to track everyone down,'' said ministry
spokeswoman Fanny Bod.
Two of the victims were men, aged 41 and 69, from Bovenkarspel, a town 40
miles north of Amsterdam where some 80 000 people visited a weeklong
flower show that ended 28 Feb 1999.
The third was a 50-year-old woman from Delftzijl, 75 miles northeast of
the capital, who also visited the annual flower event.
Bod said at least 35 people, including the three deceased, have been
diagnosed with the disease, whose symptoms are similar to those of
pneumonia. All the infections are believed to have originated from the
show.
Investigations started on Monday to determine how many people were at
risk. "We are doing everything we can to find out why some people got sick
and others didn't in order to learn more about the illness,'' Bod added.
The exact source of the bacteria has not been confirmed but authorities
suspect it may have been a drinking fountain, a decorative water curtain
or water particles spread by sprinklers, Bod said.
Legionnaires' disease is a potentially deadly bacterial pneumonia first
discovered after an outbreak at a 1976 convention of the American Legion
in Pennsylvania. The bacteria that are believed to cause the illness are
found in soil and grow in air- conditioning ducts, storage tanks and
rivers.
