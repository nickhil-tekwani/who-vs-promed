The growers' association Unio de Pagesos (UP) has warned that this year's [2020] Catalan pome fruit production will be smaller due to a fungal disease that has gone out of control, despite appropriate phytosanitary treatments. Girona [province] has the most affected areas of apples, with a 50% drop in production due to flooded soil for more than 10 days. In Lleida [province], the impact is not as great, with between 15% and 20% lost, since timely phytosanitary treatments were implemented, as the land there was not flooded.

For pears, the impact of diseases is not as great, with [some] varieties only slightly hit. However, they are still affected by mottling, so they had to be sold to the processing industry. According to UP, the difficulties in the control of mottling may be due to a greater resistance of the disease to control products, as warned by the Action Committee on Resistance to Fungicides. UP has asked for a thorough assessment of losses to guarantee fair taxation for growers, since [they] had to deal both with a poor harvest and the extra cost of the treatments.

[While the fungal pathogen(s) reported above may be known locally, neither the story above nor the additional news items at the links below state a pathogen or supply a diagnosis of the disease(s). Symptoms of "mottling", as described, may be due to a number of diseases or external factors and are not sufficient to identify any cause(s).

A large number of fungal pathogens are known to affect pome fruit in the region. Fungicide-resistant strains, as mentioned above, may emerge for any of them. Reliable molecular diagnosis of any pathogen(s) is needed in order to be able to design suitable management strategies. However, an increased risk of crop diseases is known to exist when environmental conditions (such as flooded fields) hamper the application of agrochemicals or other measures that are known to provide effective control.
