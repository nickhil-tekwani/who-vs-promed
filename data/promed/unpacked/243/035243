Bird flu detected on a large poultry farm in Russia
---------------------------------------------------
Russian veterinary services have warned that avian flu, which is currently spreading through South East Asia, has been found on a large poultry farm in eastern Russia.

[The article indicates that the outbreak, affecting a facility of Amurski Broiler, one of the largest poultry farms in the Primorsk Territory, adjacent to the Chinese border, was caused by a low pathogenicity avian influenza virus serotype H9 [Mod.AS].

--
communicated by:
ProMED-mail rapporteur Mary Marshall

[According to OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, low pathogenic avian influenza H5 and H7 in poultry are notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Code. Hence, the current H9 outbreak in Russia's far east is not notifiable.

The following statement by Russia's Rosselkhoznadzor, published 22 May 2012, is of relevance:

"According to the data provided by the Rosselkhoznadzor low pathogenic influenza H9 is likely to have occurred in South East Asia and now it is spreading. There is a risk of its introduction into eastern and central Siberia. According to some data available this virus has already occurred in synanthropic birds and possibly in migratory wild birds in the Amur Oblast".

Additional details on the current Russian outbreak and on the H9 situation in north eastern China would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
