Laboratory tests have confirmed an outbreak of tularemia in Kosovo and the
Institute of Public Health has now identified 250 suspected cases spread
across almost 90 per cent of the territory, with most cases in the western
area. The first cases date back to August 1999. Confirmation of the
outbreak came from laboratory tests in Rome, Tirana and Skopje.
Tularemia, which is endemic in many parts of the world, including North
America, eastern Europe, China, Japan and Scandinavia, is a bacterial
disease normally transmitted from animal hosts and has a variety of
clinical manifestations. The symptoms in Kosovo include high fever and body
aches, swollen glands and difficulty with swallowing, which continue over a
period of a couple of weeks. People with these symptoms should go to their
doctor.
There have been no reports of death and in normal daily conditions the
disease is not transmitted directly person-to-person. Investigations are
continuing to identify the mode of transmission and source in the current
outbreak. Tularemia (_Francisella tularensis_) is also known as Rabbit
fever, Deer-fly fever, Ohara disease or Francis disease. Tularemia can be
transmitted to humans via ticks, drinking water contaminated by rats,
handling of under-cooked infected meat from host animals, such as rabbits,
and through contaminated soil. So far 26 municipalities in Kosovo have
reported suspected cases. Symptoms are not specific and diagnosis needs to
be confirmed by blood tests. Tularemia is easily treatable.
The Institute of Public Health has prepared guidelines for the public and
these are now being distributed to medical centres throughout Kosovo.
People are being advised to keep their surroundings clean, disinfect or
boil drinking water, and ensure that food is kept away from rats and cooked
thoroughly. In addition, they are being advised not handle dead rats and
rabbits.
International experts on tularemia from WHO, Centers for Disease Prevention
and Control (CDC, Fort Collins), Istituto Superiore di Sanit√†, (ISS,
Italy), European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPINET)
and a senior German epidemiologist and microbiologist have arrived in
Kosovo to help health authorities with the scientific investigation and
with outbreak containment.
