An outbreak of tularemia was reported from the village of Zemo Ren in
eastern Georgia. According to the Center of Public Health Services of
the Kaspskiy district, more than 30 persons of different ages have
become ill with tularemia. The pathogenic agent of tularemia has been
found in potable water from the village.
Vakhtang Maisuradze, the Head of Administration of the Kaspskiy
district, has given assurances that the situation related to the
focus of infection is under control. It is strictly forbidden for the
local population to drink water from this source, Maisuradze said.

[ProMED would be interested in additional information regarding these
cases, especially regarding how the diagnosis was made and the form
or forms of tularemia that the individuals acquired (i.e.,
ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, typhoidal, or pneumonic). Although
classically transmitted to humans via infected animals, such as
rabbits or a tick vector, infection with _Francisella tularensis_ may
be acquired from contact with soil or water harboring the bacterium.
Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64
cases in Dagestan, Russia, associated with a flood-plain swamp (1),
49 cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system
(2), and an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia, also
attributed to contamination of a water supply (3).
