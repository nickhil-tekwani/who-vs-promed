Birds / 9.74 / 3.76 / 38.57 [see comment] / **

*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The H5N8 subtype of viruses has a series of basic amino acids at the haemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site, such as LREKRRKR/GLF or LRERRRKR/GLF, which [make it] highly pathogenic to chickens. The intravenous pathogenic index was 3.0, which [indicates that it is] highly pathogenic to chickens. The Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (QIA) injected intravenously 0.1 ml of the 1/10 diluted virus into each of 10 6-week-old SPF chickens. All birds died within 24 hours.

QIA submitted the genetic information to GenBank and a manuscript to the journal Emerging Infectious Disease (MS No.EID-14-0233) about the outbreak situation and the genetic information on 27 Jan 2014.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs; stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (National laboratory)

Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 26 Feb 2014 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / 26 Feb 2014 / Positive
Birds / virus sequencing / 26 Feb 2014 / Positive

Future Reporting:
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The given 38.57 percent "case fatality rate" is in need of clarification. Combining the mortality figures of chickens and ducks led to biased results.

Out of the 12 reported outbreaks, 7 were related to duck flocks, in which 26 706 "cases" were recorded, of which only 111 died. This extremely low case-fatality rate (0.4 percent) is in contrast to the one seen (apparently, as expected) in the chicken holdings.

Since the start of this epizootic, 27 outbreaks have been reported from South Korea; see interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/ol4s3qz. - Mod.AS
