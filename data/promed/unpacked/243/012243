Re: Influenza (59): Australia (QL) 20111020.3125
------------------------------------------------
Your recent post of a news byline may have incorrectly suggested a
recent rise in influenza cases in Australia and also that the State of
Queensland suffered more influenza than other parts of the country.

It is unclear what prompted the recent news report as influenza peaked
in August this year [2011] as it commonly does. The report did
accurately indicate that of the last decade, during which
laboratory-diagnosed influenza has been a reportable disease in
Australia, the number of reported cases this year was 2nd only to the
pandemic year 2009.

The issue raised by the moderator regarding the incidence in
Queensland, and not just for this year, has been the subject of a
recent publication [S. B. Lambert, C. E. Faux, K. A. Grant, S. H.
Williams, C. Bletchly, M. G. Catton, D. W. Smith, and H. A. Kelly.
Influenza surveillance in Australia: we need to do more than count.
Med J Aust. 193 (1):43-45, 2010] and it is widely considered that this
is a testing artifact.

For anyone who is interested detailed reports of the 2011 Australian
influenza season are available though the Australian Government web
site at:

And detailed statistics are available at:
