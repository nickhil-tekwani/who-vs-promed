Leopard dies from bird flu in Thailand
--------------------------------------
A leopard has died from bird flu in a Thai zoo, a cabinet minister said on
Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) said it had little information
about the case -- but if confirmed it could be the first known time the
disease has jumped to exotic animals or members of the cat family.
The clouded leopard died 27 Jan 2004 at Khao Khiew Zoo in Chonburi
province, 70 km south of Bangkok, minister of natural resources and the
environment Prapat Panyachatraksa said. "After double and triple tests,
veterinarians confirmed that the leopard died from bird flu," he told
reporters. But later in the day, Mr Prapat said authorities were still
waiting for the results of the 3rd test. He said the 1st one was done at a
state laboratory, while the 2nd was done at an independent lab. Both tests
showed the leopard had bird flu, but of different strains.
An official at the zoo, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
leopard's death "may have been as a result of eating chicken infected with
bird flu."
Bird flu has swept through Thailand, ravaging its poultry industry and
killing 5 people. The disease has struck 10 countries and territories in
Asia and has also killed 14 people in Viet Nam.
Clouded leopards are an endangered subspecies in South East Asia. WHO's
Bangkok spokesman, Mr John Rainford, said that even if bird flu has jumped
to leopards, any additional threat to human health would be minimal because
of limited contact between people and exotic cats.
A UN Food and Agriculture Organization official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he could not confirm the death of the leopard. But he
stressed that even if true, it was not clear whether the animal died from
the same deadly strain of bird flu that has been sweeping through Thailand
and other countries, or a milder strain that has been found in some parts
of Asia but is not known to have jumped to humans.

H5N1 avian influenza: a chronology of key events
------------------------------------------------
12 Dec 2003: The sudden death of chickens at a farm in Eumsung district,
near the capital city of Seoul, prompts suspicions of an epidemic of highly
pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] in the Republic of Korea. Tests are
initiated. Of the 24 000 chickens on the farm, 19 000 died between 5 and 11
Dec 2003. The remaining 5000 were culled.
17 Dec 2004: Authorities in the Republic of Korea formally report an
epidemic of HPAI, caused by the H5N1 strain of the virus, at the chicken
farm. This is the first time that highly pathogenic avian influenza has
ever been reported in the country. No symptoms are reported in farmers in
close contact with the infected chickens.
26 Dec 2003: Authorities in the Republic of Korea report the spread of H5N1
infection to chicken and duck farms in 5 provinces. Altogether, more than
1.3 million chickens and ducks have died or been destroyed.
5 Jan 2004: Health authorities in Viet Nam inform the WHO office in Hanoi
of an outbreak of severe respiratory illness in 11 previously healthy
children hospitalized in Hanoi, with the most recent hospital admission on
4 Jan 2004. 7 cases were fatal and 2 patients remain critically ill. A 12th
case, a sibling of one of the Hanoi cases, died of a respiratory illness in
a provincial hospital.
Included in this report are 6 children, aged 9 months to 12 years, who died
in a Hanoi hospital of respiratory illness of unidentified cause between 31
Oct and 30 Dec 2003. For the first 5 cases, no samples are available for
analysis. Samples are available for the 6th case, a 12-year-old girl who
was admitted to hospital on 27 Dec and died 3 days later. All of these
cases were identified retrospectively based on hospital records.
It is not known whether all cases were caused by the same pathogen. The
pathogen is unknown, but thought to be an influenza virus or an adenovirus.
Arrangements are made for testing.
WHO assistance in responding to the outbreak is requested. WHO headquarters
and the regional office in Manila are alerted.
6 Jan 2004: A member of the press informs the WHO office in Hanoi of
rumoured chicken deaths in southern Viet Nam. The regional office in Manila
is alerted.
7 Jan 2004 : WHO informs public health officials worldwide through its
electronically distributed Outbreak Verification List.
8 Jan 2004: Authorities in Viet Nam report outbreaks of HPAI, caused by the
H5 subtype (later confirmed as the H5N1 strain), at farms in the southern
provinces of Long An (2 farms) and Tien Giang (1 farm). Around 70 000 birds
died or were destroyed. This is the 1st time that highly pathogenic avian
influenza has ever been reported in the country.
11 Jan 2004: Since the 5 Jan report, Vietnamese officials have identified 2
further cases of severe respiratory illness (another child and the first
adult), bringing the total since the end of October 2003 in Hanoi's
hospitals to 13.
Tests on samples from 2 fatal cases in Viet Nam (12 year old girl and 10
year old boy), performed by Hong Kong's National Influenza Centre, confirm
infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus strain.
WHO alerts its partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network
(GOARN).
12 Jan 2004: Hong Kong's National Influenza Centre confirms infection with
H5N1 in a 3rd fatal case in Viet Nam, 30 year old mother of the 12 year old
girl.
Vietnamese health authorities and WHO announce laboratory confirmation of
the 3 cases of human infection with avian H5N1.
Confirmation of these 3 cases marks the 3rd time in recent years that the
H5N1 strain has jumped from its avian host to infect humans. The previous
human infections occurred in Hong Kong in 1997 (18 cases, 6 of which were
fatal) and again in Hong Kong in Feb 2003 (2 cases, one of which was
fatal). The 1997 outbreak coincided with H5N1 HPAI in Hong Kong's poultry
farms and live markets. The 2 cases in 2003 had returned to Hong Kong
following travel in southern China.
Authorities in Japan report an outbreak of HPAI, caused by the H5N1 strain,
at a farm in Yamaguchi prefecture. This is the 1st report of HPAI in the
country since 1925.
13 Jan 2004: Authorities in the Republic of Korea announce the spread of
H5N1 infection to an additional farm, dashing hopes that the epidemic had
been brought under control. To date, about 1.6 million birds have died or
been destroyed.
Sequencing of virus from one of the fatal cases in Viet Nam reveals that
all genes are of avian origin.
14 Jan 2004: WHO sends an urgent request for assistance to GOARN to
identify experts to support the Vietnamese health authorities and the WHO
office in Hanoi. Immediate objectives are to reduce the risk of
transmission from birds to humans and to support health authorities in the
epidemiological investigation and containment of human cases. Expertise is
also requested to increase laboratory capacity, to advise on hospital
infection control, and to strengthen surveillance for human cases.
15 Jan 2004: A 4th case of human infection with H5N1 is confirmed in Viet
Nam. All 4 cases, who had been hospitalized in Hanoi, were fatal.
19 Jan 2004: A 5th fatal case of H5N1 infection is confirmed in Viet Nam,
also in Hanoi.
A single peregrine falcon is found dead near a residential development in
Hong Kong. Testing begins immediately. 2 days later, H5N1 is confirmed in
samples taken from the bird.
WHO staff and a GOARN international team arrive in Viet Nam.
20 Jan 2004: Laboratories in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network
accelerate work needed to develop an H5N1 vaccine for humans.
22 Jan 2004: Network laboratories determine that H5N1 viruses in the
current human and avian outbreaks are significantly different from H5N1
viruses in outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, indicating that the
virus has mutated.
23 Jan 2004: Authorities in Thailand report an outbreak of HPAI, caused by
the H5N1 strain, at a farm in Suphanburi Province. This is the 1st time
that HPAI has ever been reported in the country. Nearly 70 000 birds have
died or been destroyed. Japan, the EU, and other major export markets
immediately ban all Thai poultry products.
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand informs WHO of 2 laboratory
confirmed cases of H5N1 infection in humans. The cases, from Suphanburi and
Kanchanburi provinces, are young boys. Both are alive.
Influenza network laboratories report that human H5N1 viruses from Viet Nam
are resistant to one class of antiviral drugs, the M2 inhibitors,
amantadine and rimantadine.
24 Jan 2004: Viet Nam reports 2 more cases of H5N1 infection in children
hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City -- the 1st cases from the south. One child
died, and the 2nd remains hospitalized in critical condition. The country
has now reported 7 cases, 6 of which were fatal.
Viet Nam reports that the H5N1 outbreak in poultry has spread to 23 of the
country's 64 provinces. Nearly 3 million chickens have either died or been
destroyed.
Cambodia reports H5N1 in chickens in a farm near Phnom Penh.
25 Jan 2004: WHO staff and a GOARN international team, with support from
Health Canada, arrive in Thailand.
26 Jan 2004: Authorities in Thailand report laboratory confirmation of the
country's 3rd case, also in a young child. One of the 2 previously
confirmed cases dies.
27 Jan 2004: Thailand's 3rd case, reported on 26 Jan 2004, dies. Of the 3
cases, one remains alive.
Viet Nam reports its 8th case. The child has fully recovered and been
discharged from hospital.
The Ministry of Health in China confirms the presence of highly pathogenic
H5N1 avian influenza in poultry at a duck farm in the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region in the south.
Laos reports poultry deaths at a farm near the capital city of Vientiane.
The report states that 2700 hens in a flock of 3000 have died. Initial
tests identify H5. Arrangements are made to test for H5N1.
Cambodia reports positive influenza A results from geese at a farm near
Phnom Penh.
28 Jan 2004: Pakistan reports an outbreak of HPAI. Testing detects the H7
subtype. The report states that 1.7 million hens have either died or been
destroyed.
30 Jan 2004: Chinese authorities confirm H5N1 infection in poultry at farms
in an additional 2 provinces, Hunan and Hubei. Suspected outbreaks are
reported in Anhui and Guangdong provinces and in Shanghai municipality.
1 Feb 2004: Viet Nam confirms 2 further cases, both fatal, in sisters, aged
23 and 30 years. Of the country's 10 cases, 8 have died, one has recovered,
and one remains hospitalized.
2 Feb 2004: Thailand reports its 4th confirmed case of H5N1 infection in a
58-year-old woman from Suphanburi Province, who died on 27 Jan. Of the
country's four cases, 3 have been fatal.
Chinese authorities report that H5N1 infection is now confirmed or
suspected in 10 of the country's 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities.
A WHO investigation of a family cluster in Thai Binh Province, Viet Nam,
fails to reveal a specific event, such as contact with sick poultry, or an
environmental source, to explain these cases and concludes that limited
human-to-human [transmission] is one possible explanation.
Indonesia reports an outbreak of HPAI in poultry, subsequently confirmed as
H5N1. This is the first time that HPAI has ever been reported in the country.
3 Feb 2004: Thailand's one surviving case, reported on 23 Jan, dies. To
date, Thailand has reported 4 cases, all fatal.
Viet Nam reports an additional 3 cases, one fatal, all in young adults.
Authorities in Viet Nam report that 52 of the country's 64 provinces have
been affected by H5N1 in poultry.
Thai authorities estimate that around 26.9 million chickens have been
culled nationwide, with slaughtering continuing in 7 provinces. Altogether,
36 of the country's 76 provinces have been affected.
Tests confirm that the poultry outbreaks in Indonesia are caused by H5N1.
In 1995, HPAI was declared to be present throughout the country.
4 Feb 2004: Chinese authorities report the spread of H5N1 infection in
poultry to farms in 2 additional provinces.
In Vientiane, Laos, 17 out of 18 farms (including one duck farm) test
positive for the H5 subtype.
5 Feb 2004: Viet Nam reports 2 further cases, both fatal, in young adults.
Thailand confirms the country's 5th case. The patient, a child, died on 2
Feb 2004.
In Thailand, 40 of the country's 76 provinces have reported H5N1 disease in
poultry.
The Republic of Korea confirms H5N1 infection at an additional 2 farms in
Asan, south of Seoul, suggesting that the epidemic in birds is not fully
under control.
6 Feb 2004: A GOARN international team arrives in Cambodia. Members of the
GOARN team are drawn from the Institut de Veille Sanitaire and the Institut
Pasteur Network in France.
China confirms further spread in poultry. Altogether, H5N1 infection is
confirmed or suspected at farms in 13 of the country's 31 administrative
districts.
In Viet Nam, 56 of the country's 64 provinces are now affected by H5N1
disease in poultry.
As part of the investigation of possible human-to-human transmission in a
family cluster in Viet Nam, virus from one fatal confirmed case is fully
sequenced. All genes are of avian origin. This finding does not, however,
entirely rule out limited human-to-human transmission. If this occurred,
the chain of transmission reached a dead end with the death or recovery of
all family members in the cluster.
8 Feb 2004: US authorities report an outbreak of avian influenza at a farm
in Delaware. H7 is detected in the initial tests. Further tests are
initiated to determine if the H7 subtype is highly pathogenic. Some 12 000
birds are destroyed.
OIE reports that half a million birds have been culled at 9 farms in China
where H5N1 infection has been confirmed.
9 Feb 2004: Viet Nam reports 3 additional cases, 2 of which were fatal.
The total number of cases in the 2 affected countries, Viet Nam and
Thailand, is now 23 cases, of which 18 were fatal.

poultry. Around 27 million birds have died or been destroyed.
10 Feb 2004: Chinese authorities report a suspected H5N1 outbreak at a
chicken farm in Tianjin Municipality. Spread to additional farms within
other provinces is also reported. Altogether, H5N1 infection is suspected
or confirmed on 39 farms in 14 of the country's 31 provinces, autonomous
regions, and municipalities. Of the outbreaks at 39 farms, 19 are confirmed
as caused by H5N1.
Avian influenza is detected at a 2nd farm in Delaware. Some 72 000 birds
are destroyed. Japan, China, Poland, Malaysia, Singapore, and the Republic
of Korea ban poultry imports from the US.
11 Feb 2004: In the investigation of possible human-to-human transmission
in Viet Nam, results from the analysis of virus isolated from the 2nd
sister in the family cluster show that the virus is of avian origin and
contains no human influenza genes.
WHO issues guidelines for global surveillance aimed at monitoring spread of
H5N1 infection in human and animal populations.
The number of farms in China with confirmed H5N1 outbreaks increases from
19 to 23.
12 Feb 2004: Thailand confirms its 6th case, a 13 year old boy.
Viet Nam confirms its 19th case, which was fatal, in a 19-year-old man who
had been hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City.

Bird flu: HK sets mass cull plan
--------------------------------
Hong Kong would cull its entire stock of farm chickens, ducks, and pigeons
if even one case of bird flu was found among the flocks or in humans, a
government spokeswoman confirmed today.
The contingency plan was established to ensure Hong Kong remains free of
H5N1 and other bird flu viruses that have infected 10 Asian countries and
the US, killing at least 19 people.
The Government will order the mass cull of the city's estimated 2.7 million
poultry birds at 199 chicken and pigeon farms should the flu virus be
detected within the former British territory.
"In the event of a case of H5N1 virus being found in a dead chicken or
detection of a local H5N1 human infection ... we will cull all live poultry
to prevent the spread of avian influenza and to minimise the risk of human
infections," a paper presented to the city's legislature states.
Once an infection is discovered, the Government will declare all farms,
wholesalers, and markets infected areas, allowing them to begin the cull.
Farms will also be placed under quarantine.
Hong Kong's cull of 2 million chickens in 1997 to end an outbreak that
killed 6 people has been praised by World Health Organisation (WHO)
officials battling the outbreaks as a model response. The UN agency says
mass slaughter is the only way of ensuring the disease does not spread.
Hong Kong has fought valiantly to keep the bird flu from its shores. It has
banned poultry imports from infected countries, imposed strict health
checks on visitors entering the city, and subjected poultry farmers,
wholesalers, and market traders to stringent hygiene inspections.
The moves have had a devastating effect on the local poultry industry,
which has seen demand slide from about 150 000 chickens a day to just 27,000.
The Government was forced to reiterate its tough stance yesterday, as
chicken workers staged a noisy street protest calling for the lifting of
the import ban on neighbouring China -- the source of most of Hong Kong's
poultry.
"Public health will have to remain the over-riding principle," health
secretary Carrie Yau said, rejecting the calls.

FAO says bird flu outbreak still not under control, urges vigilance
--------------------------------------------------
Asia's bird flu epidemic is still not under control despite a cull of more
than 80 million poultry, and affected nations must remain vigilant, the
UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Friday. "The spread of
the avian influenza virus in several Asian countries is still not under
control... Cambodia, China, Indonesia and Laos continue to report new
outbreaks in poultry," it said.
The UN agency said that cooperation with the regional nations hit by the
deadly virus had "significantly improved" but that the response to the
crisis in some poorer countries had been slow. "Countries realise that
cooperation and transparency are absolutely essential for the fight against
bird flu," the agency said. "While China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam
have set up information and response structures, the situation remains very
difficult in some of the affected countries." The slow response to the
emergency was due to a lack of resources such as veterinary staff,
diagnostic tools, and transport, it said.
"In addition, the urgently required administrative and political structures
to run an effective emergency campaign are often not yet in place," it
said, adding that donor funds and emergency assistance should be better
targeted.
Veterinarians from more than 20 countries will meet in Bangkok from 26-28
Feb 2004 to discuss the economic impact of the bird flu crisis, strategies
to control the disease, and how to rebuild shattered poultry industries, it
said.
The FAO said that 80 million poultry in Thailand, Viet Nam, Indonesia, and
Pakistan had now been slaughtered in a bid to curb the spread of the
disease. It did not include more than 1.2 million chickens, ducks and geese
culled in China, where a total of 46 confirmed and suspected outbreaks of
the H5N1 virus have been reported, affecting 14 of the country's 31
provincial-level regions.
The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has emerged in Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Japan, Laos, South Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Pakistan and
Taiwan have announced weaker strains, as has the United States, where bird
flu has been found in the state of Delaware.
19 people have died in Viet Nam and Thailand but no other countries have
reported human infections.
