New _Salmonella_ Potsdam outbreak announced by FDA
--------------------------------------------------
FDA's CORE Response Teams have published information about food poisoning outbreaks for the last month or so on their CORE Investigation Table. This table lists recent outbreaks caused by _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_, and other pathogens. This table sometimes links to actionable steps for consumers to take, but it may not. At this time, there is no information about the potential food source for the new _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Potsdam outbreak.

In the case of this new outbreak that was added to the table today [24 Dec 2020], 7 people are sick. The case is active, and no product or establishment has been linked to these illnesses yet.

_Salmonella_ Potsdam is a rare pathogen. In fact, there has been only one food poisoning outbreak caused by that bacteria in the last 20 years and that one occurred in New South Wales. In 2011, emergence of _S._ Potsdam as a major serovar [or serotype] in waterfowl hatcheries and chicken eggs was studied by the National Institutes of Health.

In 2002, a _Salmonella_ Potsdam outbreak that was associated with a salad dressing served at a restaurant sickened at least 12 people in New South Wales. Illness onset dates ranged from 27 Jan 2002 to 7 Feb 2002. The epidemiologic investigation did not find the pathogen in a food source, but shell egg-based Caesar salad dressing and mayonnaise, along with a swab of a cap from a mayonnaise bottle collected from the restaurant in question, both tested positive for _S._ Potsdam. In addition, environmental and laying hen feed samples from the egg supplier to the restaurant, and meat meal, which is the major component of laying hen feed, tested positive for various _Salmonella_ serotypes.

Investigators found issues with inadequate cleaning, time-temperature abuse, and ignorance of the hazardous nature of raw shell eggs at the restaurant level. And at the egg production plant, there were problems with cleaning, storage, and bacterial monitoring of the final product.

Public health interventions were conducted, which "likely prevented further cases of foodborne disease" in New South Wales.
