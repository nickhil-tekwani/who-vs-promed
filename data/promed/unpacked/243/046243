Uganda: Hepatitis E death toll reaches 98
-----------------------------------------
The hepatitis E death toll in Kitgum has reached 98, the district
chairman, John Ogwok, said on Wednesday [30 Jul 2008]. He added that
over 6000 cases had been registered in the district since the
outbreak began in October last year [2007].

He appealed to the leaders at the grassroots to mobilise and
sensitise the communities on hygiene and sanitation in order to
control the spread of the disease. He said leaders have to ensure
that each household has a pit latrine and that the compounds and
surrounding areas are kept clean in accordance with public health regulations.

The head of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Kitgum, Dr Charles
Okot, said hepatitis E had affected about 68 percent of the
population in Kitgum. He added that the district needed more support
from the government and health agencies in eradicating it. "The main
risk factor is the low latrine coverage in the newly-created IDP
[internally displaced persons] camps or in the villages to which the
people are returning. Most people use the bush and when it rains, the
water takes the faeces into water sources and contaminates them," he explained.

There is also the problem of inadequate safe drinking water sources
in the villages, he said, and called for the drilling of more
boreholes. "Our population still practices communal hand washing, or
use water in the same basin. So if one of them visited the toilet and
his or her faeces had hepatitis E [virus], then the others will
definitely get the infection."

Meanwhile, [reporter] Mary Karugaba [notes] that the Acholi
Parliamentary Group has expressed concern about the rate at which the
disease is spreading. They said it has spread to the districts of
Pader, Gulu, and Amuru, covering the entire Acholi region. Addressing
journalists on Thursday [31 Jul 2008], the group, led by chairperson
Livingstone Okello Okello, said: "An average of 112 people share one
latrine in the IDP camps, almost 6 times above the standard
requirement of 20 people per latrine." They also said there was need
for water vessels of 20 litre capacity with narrow necks to replace
the wide neck pots that are highly responsible for household water
contamination. The health ministry has urged people in affected areas
to boil all drinking water and keep water containers clean.

[The hepatitis E outbreak in the Kitgum region of northern Uganda,
which began in October 2007, has not yet been contained and indeed is
worsening. Since the last report from the region on 16 Jul 2008, the
number of fatalities has risen from 67 to 98 and the number of cases
from around 4000 to around 6000. The outbreak has now spread to
engulf the Acholi region. The source of the problem is well
recognised and there is an urgent need to accelerate the provision of
improved sanitation and clean water supplies for both local villagers
and the occupants of refugee camps..
