[Parts [1] and [2] of the ProMED-mail post "West Nile virus update 2002 -
USA (22) 20020919.5360" reported the occurrence of West Nile virus infection
in grey squirrels in the Chicago area. The following request for information
has been received from a subscriber in Michigan. ProMED-mail posts this
request as a public service. Any relevant information should be sent
directly to Michele Hurd, not to ProMED-mail. - Mod.CP]
As a wildlife rehabilitator in Michigan, we have had many numbers (and
increasing) fox squirrel deaths lately. Unfortunately at this point in time
our State is testing crows only, so we can't confirm the deaths are from
West Nile virus. We are located in a current "hot spot". Anyone know of any
private labs testing or ways/means to get our State to broaden their test
species?
