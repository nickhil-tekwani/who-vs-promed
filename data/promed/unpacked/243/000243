Measures against avian influenza AH7N3 in Coahuila and Durango*
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To ensure quick detection of cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (AI) AH7N3 in Coahuila, the National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality (Senasica) has established epidemiological surveillance, for which they will take samples from 100% of the poultry production units (UPA) in the state and the Comarca Lagunera, which also covers part of the state of Durango.

The agency of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development reported that to prevent the spread of the virus, it imposed an internal quarantine on farms in all the municipalities of the states of Coahuila and Durango, which will remain in place until such time as it is confirmed they are negative.

This measure means the Senasica established restrictions and requirements for the movement of birds, their products and by-products, and the absolute prohibition against extracting bird waste from the Poultry Production Units: chicken manure and poultry manure.

The agency indicated that personnel of the General Directorate of Animal Health (DGSA) of the Senasica has imposed a definitive quarantine on all the affected production units, and are supervising the application of the corresponding animal health measures, in addition to the depopulation of the farms. This implies the destruction of the remains of the animals, their waste and other contaminated materials, and later a meticulous cleaning and disinfection of the facilities will be carried out.

Through the epidemiological investigation carried out in the affected region, the staff of the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA) of the DGSA confirmed the presence of the virus in a commercial laying farm located in the municipality of Ramos Arizpe, Coahuila, which reports an inventory of 230 000 birds and mortality of 90%. The farm has been placed under total definitive quarantine, with the measures that this implies.

The CPA technicians also confirmed the presence of the disease in 3 farms in the Comarca Lagunera, one of them in Gómez Palacio, Durango, with a population of 48 000 birds, so today the operation also began in that region.

In order to respond to this emergency, Senasica has expanded the capacity of its Molecular Biology Laboratory located in the Comarca Lagunera. There are now lab staff in 3 shifts to process samples 24 hours a day.

The agency also reported that inter-institutional coordination meetings have been held with producers from the Saltillo region and the Comarca Lagunera to explain the strategy to contain the outbreak in Coahuila and Durango.

Federal and state authorities participated in the meetings and have shown a high willingness to contain the outbreak as soon as possible. The National Guard has also joined the mobilization.

It is important to mention that there are 102 registered commercial poultry farms in Coahuila, with an estimated population of 4.5 million birds, mostly broiler breeders, or producers of fertile eggs.

The Lagunera Region has 268 commercial farms, most of which raise broilers.

*[Durango is a sparsely populated state in northwest Mexico, with terrain marked by forest, desert and the Sierra Madre mountains. The capital, Victoria de Durango, has a historic center with several well-preserved baroque buildings, including the Basilica Menor Inmaculada Concepción. Outside the city, the small towns Villas del Oeste and Chupaderos frequently have been filming locations for Wild West movies.]

[The AH7N3 virus is generally not a disease affecting humans, but cases of conjunctivitis have been reported. Genomic and antigenic analyses of 1 isolate indicated relatedness to poultry and wild bird subtype H7N3 viruses from North America in a 2012 case.

This avian influenza virus has already been determined to be a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) strain by the OIE.

As it seems most of North America is dealing with avian influenza, this is just another variant to be on the lookout for. - Mod.TG
