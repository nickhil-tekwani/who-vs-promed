Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease concerns prompt warning on transfusions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blood transfusion patients should ask whether the procedure is "absolutely
necessary" because of the unknown risk of contracting variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail}, Scotland's transfusion chief has warned. Professor Ian
Franklin said although there was no current evidence that blood products
can transmit the infectious agent which causes the human equivalent of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), it remained a possibility. He said
that meant attitudes to transfusions which could be avoided needed to change.
Professor Franklin, Medical Director of the Scottish National Blood
Transfusion Service, was speaking following a row over hemophiliacs who
were not told for 2 years that they might have been exposed to blood
products from a donor who later developed vCJD. He said: "I don't want to
mistakenly give the impression of being completely reassuring here. We
prefer to use the term unknown or uncertain risk [of transmission of vCJD
through blood]. There may well be a risk. "That shouldn't make people
worried about a transfusion if it's going to save their life or maintain
their quality of life, but they should consult with their doctors whether a
transfusion is absolutely necessary. We would support that." He said
examples where it might be better to avoid a transfusion, as a precaution,
included patients who were slightly anemic following hospital treatment. He
added: "If you look at the history of blood transfusion it will tell you
it's not a zero-risk product."
Professor James Ironside, of the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, said
Franklin's advice was "reasonable".

[The risk of transmission of vCJD via blood transfusion is a theoretical
possibility following the experimental transmission of BSE and natural
scrapie to a small number of sheep by experimental transfusion of large
volumes of contaminated blood (see references below). There has been no
evidence to indicate that any cases of vCJD in humans has been associated
with transfusion of blood. Nonetheless Professor Franklin's advice is
sensible. - Mod.CP]
