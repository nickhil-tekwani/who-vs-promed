The public health officials in the Volgograd oblast have held a
meeting recently to discuss the necessary measures to protect the
population from West Nile virus [WNV] infection. It is being
recognized that the epidemic season for WNV infection has started.

As of 4 Aug [2011], there were 5 local cases in the city of Volgograd.
Three of the cases had moderate severity, and 2 were mild.

One of the factors contributing to the WNV epidemic process in
Volgograd is the high temperature. Households are being advised to
protect themselves from mosquito bites both at home and during outdoor
activities. A list of water bodies that should be treated for mosquito
larvae also has been established.

[There were over 300 encephalitis cases due to WNV infection last year
(2010), and WNV may now be endemic. Comparative genetic studies of the
local virus with those from areas of eastern Europe would be of
interest.
