As one with an abiding interest in the subject of rabies in bats, may I be
permitted to make one or two comments on recent happenings in Europe, with
the objective of increasing awareness?
Although records of bat bites leading to the death of humans and animals in
Central and South America in the sixteenth century are almost certainly the
earliest indications of rabies in bats, not until 1911 did Carini note
Negri bodies (pathognomic of rabies) in histological sections from the
brains of cattle dying of an undiagnosed disease in southern Brazil.
Subsequently, rabies was confirmed in insectivorous, frugivorous and
haematophagous (vampire) bats in Trinidad by Pawan in 1936. Little notice
was taken of this finding until 1953, when a boy in Florida was attacked by
a rabid insectivorous bat. Within a decade bat rabies in insectivorous
species was also reported from most Central and South American countries
and from Canada.
The Florida incident sparked interest in and awareness of bat rabies in
many parts of the world. It is no coincidence that within a short period
of time Lagos bat virus was isolated from frugivorous bats in Africa (and
later in insectivorous bats) and rabies was confirmed in an insectivorous
bat in Europe.
Today, more than 500 bat rabies cases have been recorded throughout Europe,
with an apparent 'peak' in incidence in 1986/87, when 262 cases were
reported, predominantly from Denmark and the Netherlands; currently, only
about a dozen cases are reported each year.
In each of the ten European countries to have reported bat rabies, the
disease came to light when a member of the public came into contact with an
infected bat. This is an important point to make. Even today we do not know
the extent of European bat rabies, since bats are protected species under
law and very few countries examine bats unless they have come into contact
with a human in suspicious circumstances.
Just as the doctor who sent the bat which bit a schoolteacher in Denmark in
1985 to the laboratory for rabies examination is to be congratulated on his
foresight, so too are the Danish workers who have isolated an EBL1a virus
from sheep. Mention of the virus type behooves us never to forget that,
whatever name or classification we give them, these viruses are simply
rabies viruses which over time, possibly centuries, have become adapted to
certain bat species. But they are rabies viruses nevertheless and when they
infect other species, including man, they cause a death which, in the
majority of cases, is clinically indistinguishable from classical rabies.
That is not to say that we should be alarmist or to persecute bats, the
most gentle and harmless of creatures. We must simply be aware that they
may carry diseases including rabies and that if by misfortune one is bitten
by a bat, one should seek medical advice and/or post-exposure treatment
straightaway, even in apparently bat-rabies free countries. WHO recommends
that people in rabies-infected countries should be informed of the risk of
infection, to ensure that every person bitten by an insectivorous bat
receives appropriate treatment.
