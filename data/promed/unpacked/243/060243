WHO is supporting the national authorities in the response to an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD; formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever). The outbreak is now confirmed to be caused by a strain of ebolavirus with very close homology (98 percent) to the Zaire ebolavirus. This is the 1st time the disease has been detected in West Africa. Cases were 1st reported from forested areas in southeastern Guinea. The outbreak has rapidly evolved, and several districts and Conakry have reported cases and deaths caused by EVD. A small number of suspected cases and deaths has also been reported from neighbouring countries with all of them having crossed from Guinea. Confirmed cases have been reported from Guinea and Liberia. (Read more at source URL).

Guinea's health authorities Thursday [3 Apr 2014] said 4 new ebolavirus disease cases have been reported in the country, bringing the total number of patients to 134, out of which 84 have succumbed to the viral disease. The disease is mostly widespread in the southern regional towns of Gueckedou, Macenta, Kissidougou and the capital Conakry, Xinhua reported.

To curb the spread of the epidemic, the government has taken certain measures that include setting up medical isolation centres in the affected regions and disinfection of homes with suspected cases or where ebolavirus disease patients have died. The government has also undertaken mobilisation of necessary resources to provide individual protective materials to the most affected zones. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) has equally proceeded to distribute hygiene kits to schools in areas most hit by the virus.

As of 1 Apr 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported a cumulative total of 127 clinically compatible cases of EVD, of which 35 are laboratory confirmed by PCR. The total number includes 83 deaths (CRF 65 percent). These figures correspond to 5 new clinical cases and 3 new deaths since the last update on 31 Mar 2014; 22 patients remain in isolation.

The current numbers of clinical cases by place of report are:

- Conakry (12 cases, including 4 deaths),
- Guekedou (79 cases/57 deaths),
- Macenta (23 cases/14 deaths),
- Kissidougou (9 cases/5 deaths), and
- Dabola and Djingaraye combined (4 cases/3 deaths).

11 of the cases in Conakry have been laboratory confirmed for Ebola virus disease (EVD); 14 health care workers have also been laboratory confirmed for EVD, 8 of whom have died. Case investigation and contact tracing are continuing, with 375 contacts under medical follow-up at present.

When more than 3.5 tons of protection material arrived in Conakry, the capital of Guinea, on 30 Mar 2014, WHO immediately started distributing it to health facilities in different locations dealing with the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD).

The supplies include single-use personal protection equipment and disinfection and secure burial material. Half of the infected persons in Conakry are health workers. Providing them with adequate training and necessary equipment is crucial for infection control. As there is no treatment or vaccine available, prevention is the most effective way to stop the transmission.

"These supplies are essential, as we were not able to be in contact with sick persons who could have Ebola. With protection equipment, we feel reassured and can do our job to help patients," said Dr Lansana Kourouma, head of the emergency section of the Chinese-Guinean Friendship hospital, where 5 patients are currently under observation.

The material was also sent to the Donka national teaching hospital in Conakry, where an isolation ward has been set up to provide care to infected persons. The ward is located in a separate building. The Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal has dispatched technicians to the hospital so it can carry out on-site rapid testing.

"The biggest problems at Donka are no electricity, no water, no equipment, no sanitation, and very high rates of infection," said Bintu Cisse, adjunct midwife supervisor, who has worked at Donka National Hospital for 20 years.

Donka, the largest medical center in Guinea, is run by the government and maintains short and long term partnerships with international aid organizations such as UNICEF and MSF (Medecins sans Frontieres or Doctors Without Borders). External support provides some operational assistance, but Donka lacks basic facilities due to the inefficiency of Guinea's under-performing infrastructure.

Inside the maternity ward operating room, Cisse pointed out that the equipment did not work, and doctors used suspended basins of water and a mixture of chlorine to sanitize. The main light sources were open windows. Outside, garbage was burning.

[In summary, a young man from the frontier with Guinea was spotted at the bus station in Bamako, capital of Mali, and suspected to be a case of ebolavirus disease. He was taken to a hospital to be quarantined, but his relatives took him away by taxi.

Later in the day, 2 more suspect cases were spotted. One was also from the Guinea frontier, arriving with severe diarrhea and vomiting.

The entire busload of passengers was quarantined for 17 hours, while blood specimens were taken for testing. It is emphasized that there is no confirmation that they were cases of ebolavirus disease, but there is considerable anxiety in the capital.

Foreign mining firms have locked down operations in Guinea and pulled out some international staff as the death toll from suspected cases of Ebola there hit 83.

The epicentre of Guinea's 2-month old outbreak has been in the southeast, close to its main iron ore reserves. The country is also the world's top exporter of Bauxite, the raw material used in aluminium production, and has rich deposits of gold.

"Everyone is practicing precautionary strict hygiene, but there has been no real impact on production so far," a senior executive at a mining company told Reuters. The executive said he had been placed on extended leave, while other companies were preventing people from entering or leaving their mines. "Firms are more concerned by what is happening in the densely populated capital Conakry than in remote mining sites in the interior, where controls are easier to put in place," he added.

Liberia said Thursday [3 Apr 2014] that it was dealing with its 1st suspected Ebola case thought to be unconnected to the epidemic raging in Guinea and to have originated separately within its borders.

If confirmed, the case in the eastern town of Tapeta would mark a worrying development in the fight against Ebola, as cases so far have been attributed to people returning with the infection from neighbouring Guinea, where 84 people have died.

"We have a case in Tapeta where a hunter who has not had any contact with anyone coming from Guinea got sick," chief medical officer Bernice Dahn said. "He was rushed to the hospital and died 30 minutes later. He never had any interaction with someone suspected to be a carrier of the virus, and he has never gone to Guinea. This is an isolated case."

The fruit bat, thought to be the host of the highly contagious Ebola virus, is a delicacy in the region straddling Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and experts suspect huntsmen may be the source of the outbreak.

Tapeta, a small town in the eastern county of Nimba, is 400 km (250 miles) from the epicentre of the Ebola outbreak in southern Guinea, at least a 5-hour drive and much further from the border than other suspected cases.

"The huntsman has 500 traps in the forest. He felt sick in the forest and was rushed to the hospital," Dahn told AFP, adding that 7 new patients brought the total suspected Ebola cases in Liberia to 14; 6 people have died, she said, since Liberia reported its 1st cases of haemorrhagic fever last month [March 2014], raising the previous toll by 2.
