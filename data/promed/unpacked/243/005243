A flesh-eating form of [_Staphylococcus aureus_] that is easily passed between healthy people on public transport is spreading across the UK, experts have warned. The deadly strain of MRSA [methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_] called USA300 passes easily through skin-to-skin contact. It can also survive on surfaces and so has the potential to be picked up on crowded buses and tubes. It was 1st seen in the U.S but cases are now being reported in the community, and not just hospitals, in Britain.

Dr Ruth Massey, from the Department of Biology and Biochemistry at the University of Bath, said extra vigilance was required around this and similar MRSA bugs known as PVL [Panton-Valentine Leukocidin toxin]-positive community-acquired strains. USA300 is resistant to treatment by several front-line antibiotics and can cause large boils on the skin. In severe cases, USA300 can lead to fatal blood poisoning or a form of pneumonia that can eat away at lung tissue.

Dr Massey said there were 1000 cases of PVL-positive community-acquired MRSA in England in the last year, of which 200 were USA300 strains. "These community-acquired strains seem to be good at affecting healthy people -- they seem to be much better than the hospital ones at causing disease. They don't rely on health care workers moving them around, which the hospital ones seem to." Dr Massey said USA300 is "a really big issue in the U.S. and it's starting to emerge here. But hopefully because we are aware of it and are working to understand it, it won't become as big of a problem (in the UK)."

In a new research paper published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases [Rudkin JK, Edwards AM, Bowden MG, Brown EL, Pozzi C, Waters EM, Chan WC, Williams P, O'Gara JP, Massey RC. Methicillin Resistance Reduces the Virulence of Healthcare-Associated Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus by Interfering With the agr Quorum Sensing System. J Infect Dis 2012; 205. 1st published online: 1 Feb 2012], Dr Massey and colleagues analyse the way community-acquired MRSAs are able to adapt and fine-tune themselves to spread outside of hospitals. MRSA bacteria in hospitals have not been able to migrate into the community in the same way.

Dr Massey said: "Our research found that the composition of the cell wall of the bacteria is critical to the community-acquired bacteria being more toxic. The ability of the MRSA bacteria to secrete toxins is one of the main ways it causes disease. Using a sensing system, it carefully controls when it switches on its ability to do this, so as not to cause disease until it is firmly established within the human. Many antibiotics target the cell walls of harmful bacteria, and to resist this, the bacteria have to make changes to their cell wall." Community-acquired MRSA strains have cell walls that are different to those seen in hospitals, allowing them to sense their environment and switch toxin expression on at the right time.

An HPA spokesman played down the danger of USA 300, saying: "In England we have seen sporadic cases of this type of MRSA most often causing boils and abscesses, but it has not emerged as a major public health issue."

A spokeswoman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said: "The paper highlights some important observations which helps us understand at the molecular level why hospital strains of MRSA are less virulent than the so-called community [-acquired] MRSA strains. We have known about community MRSA for over a decade and, whilst they are responsible for a high burden of disease in North America, this is not the case in the rest of the world. In England we have seen sporadic cases of this type of MRSA most often causing boils and abscesses, but it has not emerged as a major public health issue in this country. The HPA are carrying out active surveillance of this type of bacteria and advise health care professionals on correct infection control procedures to reduce the likelihood of spread."

[USA300 is one of the 'USA' types of _Staphylococcus aureus_, e.g., USA100-1200 (1). This _S. aureus_ typing nomenclature is a system established by the CDC that is based on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns for both methicillin-resistant _S. aureus_ (MRSA) (2) and methicillin-susceptible _S. aureus_ (1). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcus protein A (spa) typing, and staphylococcal cassette chromosome _mec_ (SSC_mec_) typing are also used to characterize _S. aureus_ isolates. (SCC_mec_ determines methicillin-resistance.) For example, USA100 are multidrug-resistant strains of MRSA that typically are associated with health care-acquired infections.

Over the past decade, USA300 has become the predominant type of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) in the U.S. (1). It usually carries the genes encoding the Panton-Valentine Leucocidin (PVL), a toxin that predisposes to severe skin and soft-tissue infections and necrotizing pneumonia. USA300 is characterized also by having the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), MLST ST8, spa-sequence type t008, the _msr_(A) erythromycin resistance gene, and SCC _mec_ type IVa, whereas health care-acquired MRSA carry SCC_mec_ Types I, II, and III. CA-MRSA have caused outbreaks of skin and soft issue infection, as well as invasive disease (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, and osteomyelitis) in children in day care centers, military recruits, athletes participating in contact sports, IV drug users, prison inmates, men who have sex with men, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, and Native Americans, in which the infected, but otherwise healthy, individuals had no link to health care systems, unlike health care-associated (HA)-MRSA (1). Factors that have been associated with the spread of CA-MRSA skin infections in otherwise healthy people include close skin-to-skin contact, skin cuts or abrasions, contact with contaminated surfaces (e.g., gym equipment, shared towels), and poor personal hygiene.

USA300 genotype has also emerged as a significant cause of health care-associated infections in some medical facilities (3,4). CA-MRSA strains have been generally susceptible to a wider range of antibiotics, other than beta-lactams (e.g., fluoroquinolones and clindamycin). However, USA300 isolates are becoming more resistant to antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, mupirocin and tetracycline, and have spread to Europe, Japan, South America and Australia (1).

Isolation of USA300 in regions outside the U.S. (5-7) has been attributed to importation from the United States due to international travel, with the potential for subsequent spread in the local communities. In the UK, USA300 has been considered uncommon (8).
