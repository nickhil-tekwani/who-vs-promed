As a precautionary measure, Stonewall Kitchen of York, Maine is
voluntarily recalling 7 dessert sauces because they have the
potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a
bacterium, which can cause life-threatening illness or death.
Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does not look
or smell spoiled.

The following list of products was distributed nationwide to
consumers through the 9 Stonewall Kitchen Company Stores, Stonewall
Kitchen's direct-to-consumer division (catalog/internet) and through
their wholesale division. Products could have been purchased
individually or within a gift basket. This recall affects all product
codes and expiration dates for:

- Stonewall Kitchen Chocolate Hazelnut Sauce (SKU 161312) -- round
glass jar, 12 oz.
- Stonewall Kitchen Chocolate Peanut Butter (SKU 161211) -- round
glass jar, 12 oz.
- Stonewall Kitchen Coffee Caramel Sauce (SKU 161204) -- round glass
jar, 13 oz.
- Stonewall Kitchen Dulce de Leche Sauce (SKU 161214) -- round glass
jar, 12.5 oz.
- Barefoot Contessa Espresso Dulce de Leche (SKU 542313) -- round
glass jar, 10.5 oz.

Additionally, the following list of products was distributed
nationwide to consumers through A-Hold Corporation (Stop & Shop and
Giant stores). This recall affects all product codes and expiration
dates for

- Simply Enjoy Coffee Caramel Sauce -- square glass jar, 13 oz.
- Simply Enjoy Chocolate Peanut Butter Sauce -- square glass jar, 12 oz.

To date, Stonewall Kitchen has not experienced any problems or
complaints about our dessert sauces. No illnesses have been reported
to date.

Stonewall Kitchen is voluntarily recalling these products due to the
fact that during manufacturing, the pH level and water activity did
not meet our food safety standards.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food. Most of the food recalls (as in this case)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
