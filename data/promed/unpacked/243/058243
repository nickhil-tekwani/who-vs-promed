2 in PA Contract Legionnaires' Disease
--------------------------------------
2 men tested positive for Legionnaires' disease after they attended
the Pennsylvania American Legion's annual convention in Montgomery
County, not far from where 34 people died of the disease at a similar
event in 1976, hotel officials said Thu, 11 Aug 2005.
The legionnaires, 60 and 70 years old, are from the Pittsburgh area
and are back home after brief hospitalizations, said Kit Watson,
Adjutant for the Pennsylvania posts of the American Legion. 3 other
legionnaires who felt sick after the convention were tested and
results came back negative for the respiratory infection, he said
The cases come more than 3 decades after the bacterium was discovered
nearby in Philadelphia, where 34 people died and 221 became ill at an
American Legion convention in 1976.
The 2005 convention was held 14-17 Jul 2005 in King of Prussia, a
Philadelphia suburb. About 1500 people attended the event at the
Radisson Valley Forge, a complex that includes hotel rooms and a
convention center, Health Department spokesman Richard McGarvey said.
The only direct link between the 2 men was that they both attended
the convention. The hotel could be the source of the illnesses, given
the men's onset dates for the illness and the usual 2-10 day
incubation period for legionellosis, but investigators have not made
any conclusions, McGarvey said.
Montgomery County health officials are taking water samples from the site.
Legionnaires' disease often spreads through inhalation of mist from
contaminated water. It can be found in air conditioning cooling
towers, hot water tanks, whirlpool spas, humidifiers, faucets, shower
heads and moist soil.
"Certainly when you have 2 cases that have someplace in common,
you'll want to do environmental testing to see what's there,"
McGarvey said.
There are typically about 150 cases of Legionnaires' disease reported
annually in Pennsylvania, McGarvey said. As many as 90 percent of
Legionnaires' cases go unreported, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Those who contract the disease experience flulike symptoms. Untreated, the
disease proves fatal in 15 to 20 percent of the cases.
