A total of 24 horses in 17 Indiana counties have tested positive for a
mosquitoborne viral encephalitis that also can sicken humans, state
officials said on Wednesday [24 Oct 2007]. Horses have tested positive for
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in the following counties: Adams, Boone,
Daviess, Decatur, DeKalb, Elkhart, Hendricks, Howard, Jay, Kosciusko,
LaGrange, LaPorte, Noble, Putnam, Rush, Steuben, and St. Joseph.

It's the widest dispersion of the virus in Indiana in recent memory, said
Dr. Sandra Norman, equine director for the Indiana State Board of Animal
Health. "Typically, in years when we receive reports of EEE, we see them
clustered in the most northern counties in Indiana, particularly on the
western side of the state," Norman said. Because the virus is carried by
mosquitoes, the state is likely to receive new positive test results for
the virus until freezing temperatures kill off the flying pests, she said.

Eastern equine encephalitis causes incurable central nervous system
problems in horses. Humans also are susceptible to the virus, but not via
horses. Mosquitoes must feed from infected birds to spread the virus to humans.

[It is very late in the year for eastern equine encephalitis. But Indiana
has only recently received rain, so the mosquitoes must have breeding
pools. Generally where EEE is prevalent, it is recommended to vaccinate
twice a year as the immunity induced from vaccination wanes after about 6
months. A map of Indiana may be seen at
