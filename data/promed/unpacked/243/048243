----------------------------------------------------------------------
The National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa was requested by the Department of Correctional services to assist with investigation and management of leptospirosis that had been identified in 2 awaiting trial prisoners in a facility in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.

The diagnosis had been made by an astute physician, who suspected leptospirosis when a 1st patient from Pollsmoor Prison presented with overwhelming sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multi-organ failure including jaundice, following approximately a week of worsening symptoms, including conjunctivitis, myalgia, and fever. Initial tests for bacterial sepsis (blood culture), and aetiologies of viral hepatitis (A, B, C, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) were negative. The local laboratory reported a positive test result on serum using the Panbio _Leptospira_ IgM ELISA (manufactured by Standard Diagnostics, Inc, Republic of Korea). These results, along with compatible clinical symptoms and the absence of an alternative diagnosis were the basis on which the diagnosis was made. 2 subsequent cases were identified using the same case definitions and a further 2 cases are awaiting laboratory results.

An assessment of the prison facility was done and showed evidence of extensive rodent activity, including direct sighting of over 20 rats during daylight hours, numerous burrows, droppings, and dead rat carcasses. In the facility, overcrowding, difficulties in achieving adequate waste management and blocked drains created a habitat in which rodent populations were thriving. Amongst 12 rats captured during a subsequent site visit 2 days after the initial assessment, 3 were found to be positive by a nested rDNA PCR for pathogenic _Leptospira_ species. DNA of _Leptospira_ species was not found [in] any of 5 water samples obtained from blocked, overflowing drains.

Recommendations were made to the Department of Correctional Services regarding elimination of rodents in the facility and prevention of subsequent cases. The facility was subsequently closed. Blood for antileptospiral IgM and PCR is being collected, and pre-emptive treatment for leptospirosis is being prescribed amongst symptomatic prisoners prior to transfer out of the facility.

As elsewhere, leptospirosis is endemic to South Africa. Serological surveys of stray and owned dogs in 2010 revealed a seroprevalence of 4 percent (25/230), with predominance in the coastal regions of South Africa, particularly KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, and Eastern Cape provinces (1). Antibodies to serovars Tarassovi and Pyrogenes were most frequently detected. In KwaZulu-Natal in 2003, 19 percent (383/2021) of cattle from rural communities were found to have positive serology to serovars Pomona (most frequently) but also to serovars Tarrasovi, Bratislava, Hardjo, Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae (2). In the 1960s amongst 100 Cape Town dogs, 43 percent were shown to have positive serology to serovars Canicola or Icterohaemorrhagiae or both (3). In South Africa, leptospirosis was first reported in South Africa amongst dogs in 1953 (4). Subsequently, a case series on the Witwatersrand due to serovar Canicola was described by James Gear in 1958 (5). In the 1970s a number of human cases were described from Cape Town mostly due to serovar Canicola, but also Icterohaemorrhagiae (6). Presently sporadically occurring cases are identified across South Africa, with over 200 specimens submitted to the NICD annually, and less than 20 percent being positive for IgM.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Kerrigan McCarthy for providing the report that the clinical diagnosis of leptospirosis in 4 prisoners was confirmed by _Leptospira_ IgM ELISA. Laboratory confirmation is pending for 2 additional patients and laboratory confirmation is ongoing for additional (number not specified) symptomatic prisoners. - Mod.ML
