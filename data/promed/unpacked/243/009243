A 6th heroin user in Scotland has died from anthrax, with the total
number of cases now at 12. The death occurred in a man in the NHS
Forth Valley area, marking a further geographical spread of the
infection. The other cases are in Tayside, where there has been one
fatality, Glasgow, where there have been 4 deaths, and in Lanarkshire.

Health officials believe contaminated heroin or a contaminated
cutting agent may be responsible for the infections.

Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist at Health Protection
Scotland, said: "The death of this patient in NHS Forth Valley
indicates further geographical spread of the cases, meaning that
heroin users all across Scotland need to be aware of the risks of a
potentially contaminated supply. I would urge all users to stop using
heroin immediately and contact local drug support services for help
in stopping. If any heroin users do notice signs of infection, for
example marked redness and swelling around an injection site or other
signs of serious infection such as a high fever, they should seek
urgent medical advice."

A man from Tayside has died after injecting heroin laced with
anthrax, it emerged yesterday [6 Jan 2010]. He is one of 5 [now 6]
people who have died in recent weeks after taking contaminated drugs,
which Health Protection Scotland believe are circulating in Scotland.
Another 6 people are being treated in hospital with the deadly infection.

NHS Tayside is refusing to name the man or reveal exactly where and
when he died. Heroin often comes from countries where anthrax is more
prevalent in animals [Most heroin originates in Afghanistan where the
disease in livestock is enzootic. - Mod.MHJ]. Bone meal, an animal
product, is sometimes used as a cutting agent. The 1st victim, a man,
died in Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow on 16 Dec 2009.

NHS Tayside public health consultant Dr Christopher McGuigan said
health officials are working closely with Health Protection Scotland
and Tayside Police to investigate the case and minimise the risk to
other drug users. "The possible presence of a batch of heroin
contaminated with anthrax makes drug injecting even riskier and more
dangerous," he added. "While those who inject drugs need to be on
alert, the risk to others, including close family members of anyone
infected, is very small. It is extremely rare for anthrax to be
spread from person to person, and there is no significant risk of
airborne transmission from one person to another."

Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said the public should be reassured
that there is no evidence of health risks to the general population
from the outbreak which started in Glasgow. "Scottish police forces
are investigating the source of the contamination," she added. "We
will be monitoring the situation closely over the coming days and are
receiving regular updates from all involved."

The confirmed anthrax cases include 3 people in Lanarkshire and 4 men
and 3 women in Glasgow.

One woman in Fife is being investigated for the infection.

[Throughout the UK, the medical authorities are on high alert to the
possibility of further infected heroin users, not just in southern
Scotland where suspect cases are being watched but also in the rest
of the UK. The Scots have set up a national team to coordinate and
oversee their investigations as well as on the clinical aspects. The
police are intensively involved, and this should result in more
heroin samples for testing and back-tracing. Like anything else, the
system, God willing, will come out stronger because of the need for
good coordination and collaboration by the various agencies. You can
War Game until you are blue in the face, but nothing beats this like
a real emergency. But as we saw in the 2000 _Cl. novii_ series of
cases, it will take time for all the contaminated heroin to work
itself through the illicit drug distribution network.
