According to ANP news agency, the bluetongue virus has spread to the
provinces of Overijssel and Utrecht with the total number of farms affected
up to 117, since the new outbreak of the disease was 1st identified in the
Netherlands less than 2 weeks ago. [The official sites and figures are
somewhat different; see commentary. - Mod.AS]
The disease, which originates from southern Europe and Africa [so far,
BTV-8 has not been identified in southern Europe. - Mod.AS], is carried by
insects and affects sheep, goats, and cattle. [So far, goats in northern
Europe have remained practically unaffected by BTV-8. - Mod.AS]
The 1st large scale outbreak of bluetongue in the Netherlands was last year
[2006], when around 400 farms were hit.
Animals infected by bluetongue develop a high fever, excessive salivation,
and the swelling of the face and tongue. The disease does not affect humans.

the Netherlands was 125. Due to the appearance of a new case in 't Harde,
in the province Gelderland, the boundary of the "20 km area" had to be
extended further northwards.
