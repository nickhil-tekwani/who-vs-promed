Cholera in Pakistan -- still no comments from NIH Islamabad
--------------------------------------------------------------
It's been a frustrating experience watching the federal and provincial
health authorities remain silent while at least 2000 hospital admissions
and over 70 deaths from severe dehydration secondary to diarrhea are
reported in national newspapers since July. There have been confirmed
reports of _Vibrio cholerae_O1 Ogawa imported from Pakistan into Europe
and further reports of similar isolates among patients arriving from NWFP
[North West Frontier Province for treatment in a Karachi hospital.
Currently, either the outbreak appears to be over or reporters and editors
just aren't interested any more.
We know the NIH [National Institute of Health, Pakistan undertook an
epidemic investigation of the Peshawar outbreak and perhaps of another one
in southern Punjab. We were informed that our query in reference to these
outbreaks merited an official response and one would be forthcoming
shortly. Since then, we've tried not to be disruptive.
At this late stage, however, silence can only be interpreted to reflect
absolute disregard for international health regulations, frank
institutional incompetence or a fear of reporting what they've found. So
when we read reports of _Vibrio cholerae_O139 isolated from travelers in
India, we can't be faulted for thinking whether NIH didn't stumble upon
something similar in NWFP or Punjab.
The human cost (at least in the eyes of those responsible for limiting it)
seems to be inconsequential. If NIH were to publicly share details of what
happened, physicians currently managing these cases, or managing them in
future outbreaks, would be better placed to treat if they knew what
pathogens are involved and what drug resistance patterns to expect (along
with all the other benefits of good laboratory and field data).
The NIH did not cause these outbreaks. There are some very competent
public health professionals working there but they can't be held directly
responsible for what the institution will not allow them to do. This is a
failure on part of this institution to comply with its own mandate.

sign of an official announcement about the cause of these outbreaks -
