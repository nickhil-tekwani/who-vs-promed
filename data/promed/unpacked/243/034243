At least 9 patients who received dental care at the Dayton VA Medical
Center have tested positive in preliminary tests for Hepatitis B and
Hepatitis C, VA officials said Tuesday [1 Mar 2011]. Since 8 Feb 2011,
the Dayton VA has contacted 527 of 535 veterans seen by a dentist who
failed to change latex gloves and sterilize dental instruments
properly between patients. Of 375 patients tested so far, there have
been 7 hepatitis C cases, 2 hepatitis B cases and no cases of HIV,
Director Guy Richardson said.

None of the patients had been previously diagnosed, and further
testing will be needed to confirm those infections, said Dr. Andrea
Buck, the VA's national director of medicine. Epidemiological testing
will be used to determine if any confirmed cases resulted from
exposure at the Dayton VA dental clinic, but Buck said: "We may never
know the answer to that question."

The VA hasn't worked through what assistance might be available to
those 9 patients' family members if any of them are infected. Testing
so far has not been requested by family members, VA officials said.

Administrative actions were initiated against 3 employees, including
the dentist who may have infected patients from 1992 to July 2010. But
the dentist, 81, retired on 11 Feb 2011. As a result, he no longer
faces administrative action, Richardson said. "I'm not aware of any
legal requirement preventing someone from retiring" during an active
investigation, he said.

Richardson on Tuesday [1 Mar 2011] apologized to veterans. Richardson
said the VA will respond aggressively in providing free screenings as
well as care to those who may have been exposed to blood-borne
pathogens while receiving care from a VA dentist between 1992 and July
2010. Asked what responsibility he bears for the lack of oversight of
the dental clinic, Richardson said, "I'm charged as the leader of the
facility to make sure we provide high quality, safe veteran care. I
will continue to be committed to achieving that mission as long as I'm
in this position."

More details are expected to be disclosed in a yet-to-be-released VA
Office of Inspector General report. The VA is taking steps nationwide
to ensure problems in Dayton aren't repeated elsewhere, Buck said. For
example, one of the VA's own inspection controls -- Systemwide Ongoing
Assessment and Review Strategy -- added a dental component.

Buck noted the Ohio State Dental Board had declined the dentist's
request to have his license retired. Such a step is typically not
taken by the dental board unless an active investigation of that
dentist is underway. Dayton VA's testing of veterans is estimated to
cost USD 18 000 to 25 000.

[It is unclear whether the 9 dental patients who have tested positive
for blood-borne hepatitis virus infections were infected as an
immediate consequence of their treatment at the dental clinic or have
been identified through screening and had other earlier exposures. It
appears that the dentist responsible did not observe standard
infection control procedures, but his personal disease status is not
clearly stated. Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
