Canada has closed its border to Montana cattle, horses, and other livestock
for 6 weeks or more in response to an outbreak of infectious vesicular
stomatitis (VS) in 16 Yellowstone County horses.
The disease also has prompted organizers to postpone 2 Billings Livestock
Horse Sales, planned for later this month and in September, and to cancel
Malta's 2005 Mustang Stampede rodeo scheduled for next month.
The 1st case of the disease was reported 10 Aug 2005 in the Laurel area.
Dr. Tom Linfield, state veterinarian with the Department of Livestock, said
Friday that so far, 16 animals have tested positive at 11 locations. All
the locations are in Yellowstone County, though other horses are being
tested in nearby Carbon, Stillwater and Park counties.
VS is a close relative of hoof-and-mouth disease. The signs of the 2 are
identical: excessive drooling and severe lesions on noses, in mouths, and
around the hooves.
The U.S Department of Agriculture requires livestock owners and
veterinarians to report suspected outbreaks of VS.
In addition to horses and cattle, VS can be contracted by goats, sheep,
pigs, alpacas, and llamas but is rarely fatal, although VS can cause severe
weight loss, because the mouth sores make eating and drinking painful. In
humans, it can cause a flu-like illness.
The disease is moving north, having been documented in horses or cattle in
Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. Wyoming's 1st cases in
horses and a cow were reported the same day as Montana's 1st case.
Linfield said the border will be closed until 21 days after the sores heal
on the last reported animal. Lesions take 2 to 3 weeks to heal.
Discovery of the disease also voids seasonal grazing permits between
states, he said. Places like California, Idaho, and Nevada likely will want
a recent veterinarian exam before allowing animals to move into their state.
Great Falls vet Kelly Manzer said she warned several Canadian horse owners
not to come to Montana for shows or rodeos, knowing they wouldn't be able
to take their horses back across the border. Other Canadian horse owners
are stuck in Montana until the ban is lifted.
While death is very rare, VS spreads easily between animals that share
water or are in close range of each other
"The people I know are not necessarily worried about their horses getting
it, but they don't want to bring it back and spread it to cattle," Manzer
said. "If their cattle lose weight, they lose money."
Summer is a busy travel time for many horse owners, with fairs, rodeos,
horse shows and horse racing around the state. Both Manzer and Linfield
advised that people keep their horses at home if possible to slow the
spread of VS.
Livestock owners should keep their animals away from other livestock.
Simple sanitary measures like washing hands between handling different
animals and not sharing water buckets also helps.
Saliva and fluids from an infected animal can infect other livestock. Flies
also are suspected carriers. That's why the Billings horse sales will be
postponed until a good fly-killing frost occurs.
Billings Livestock Horse Sale managers Bill and Jann Parker said they sell
nearly 8000 horses per year.
"As the largest horse sale in the West, while it may be costly to us to
postpone our events, it will be beneficial to you, our consignors and our
buyers, to have the confidence in the health and safety of your animals,"
Parker said.
"We just feel that it is in the best interest of the industry to take a
lead on this," Jann Parker said. "And we hope others will follow."
BLS' 3-day sale starting 28 Oct 2005 and the sale at the end of November
will be held as scheduled and expanded to accommodate the 2 summer sales
being postponed.
"We feel that at this time, with the vector season in full swing, no
consignment horse sales should be held, period," BLS President Pat Goggins
said. He also owns PAYS Auction Yards in Billings. All the horse sales are
held at BLS.
Hundreds of animals arriving for the Montana Fair in Billings have been
visually inspected for VS symptoms. And racehorses arriving for the
Yellowstone Downs meet, which started Friday, must have a vet inspection
and a health certificate.

[This article does not tell us the strain of VS, which is hopefully being
determined at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory.
It is not uncommon for other states, or nearby countries, such as Canada,
to close its borders when this is disease is present. - Mod.TG]
