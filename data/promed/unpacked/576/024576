Aseptic meningitis is a reportable illness in our country, Argentina.
Around 1,000 cases of aseptic meningitis are reported every year by the
Department of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health. Our laboratory,
Neurovirosis Service, at the Department of Virology of the National
Institute of Infectious Disease, ANLIS "Carlos G. Malbran", is the national
reference lab for diagnosis of viral infections of central nervous system.
In the last 3 years, we have received samples from four aseptic meningitis
outbreaks that have occurred in different regions of our country. All of
them occurred during the summer, starting in 1996 in a north state of the
country with approximately 250 cases. The second took place in 1997 in
another state, on the border with Bolivia, the third was in February 1998
in a city in the western part of the country, and the last occurred in a
city of Buenos Aires state. [Human} echovirus 30 has been identified as
the etiologic agent in all four outbreaks.
Moreover, [human] echovirus 30 has been identified as the most frequent
etiologic agent of sporadic cases of aseptic meningitis. The diagnostic
was made using a generic enterovirus RT nested PCR [with] CSF, virus
isolation from CSF and stool in Rd, PTP and Vero cells. The isolates were
identified by serum neutralization with LBM pool. According to these
results, [human] echovirus 30 has been circulating in our country at least
since 1996,and is still circulating and causing sporadic meningitis around
the country. We are currently investigating the genetic variation among
the different outbreak strains in order to establish their relationships
and origins.
