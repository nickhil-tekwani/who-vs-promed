The 5th State Level Orange Festival was held today [8 Dec 2008] at
Tamenglong [Manipur].

Awangbou Newmai from Tamei Assembly constituency, revealed that the
production of oranges in Tamenglong district fell sharply this year
following the decaying of orange plants. He also said that the orange
growers were running from pillars to post seeking help as their
plants were dying.

Awangbou also questioned the horticulture department how much it had
helped to cure the unknown disease of the oranges.

[A number of diseases of citrus are known to occur in India,
including tristeza, greening, canker, and a range of fungal, viral
and viroid pathogens. Furthermore, a combination of various pathogens
may also occur in citrus and result in the decline of the crop. From
the report above it is not possible to conclude what the cause of the
problem in Manipur may be.
