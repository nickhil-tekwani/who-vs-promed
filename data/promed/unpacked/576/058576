Officials warn of rabies outbreak in Mhondoro
----------------------------------------------
Officials have warned of a rabies outbreak in Mhondoro after a boy died and
4 other people were suspected to have come into contact with the virus
infected dogs last week. The cases were treated at Manyewe Clinic and Ngezi
Hospital, both in Mhondoro, but the boy died after admission at Harare
Central Hospital.
Rabies is an acute viral disease of the nervous system that is transmitted
by rabid dogs or jackals to humans. A patient who has contracted the rabies
virus becomes severely hydrophobic (fear of water), restless, and nervous.
Symptoms also include excess salivation and panting like a dog. Rabid
animals usually die after 10 days and symptoms in humans may appear within
5 days after exposure.
Acting head of the Disease Prevention and Control unit in the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare Dr Stanley Midzi confirmed the 5 cases at the
weekend and warned people to be wary of dogs, especially stray ones that
were not likely to have been vaccinated. He said 3 of the victims were
vaccinated soon after exposure, while health officials were still following
up another boy who was bitten by the same dog that bit the boy who later died.
"We take all bites from dogs that have not been provoked as suspect because
we can only confirm rabies by testing the animals' brains. However, if a
person is bitten by any dog they should immediately seek treatment," said
Dr Midzi. He said he regretted that the shortage of foreign currency in the
country had disturbed regular dog vaccinations, which used to be conducted
by the Veterinary Services department.
Most dogs roaming the streets are not vaccinated and only a few people,
especially those living in low-density suburbs where there are facilities,
still vaccinate their dogs regularly against rabies at private centers.

[The described case in Zimbabwe -- a country where urban rabies is known to
persist -- seems to be related to a delayed reporting of the exposure in a
boy, leading to his inevitable death.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) fact sheet, where data are
available there appears to be consistency in the toll canine rabies exacts
on children in endemic communities. From age-stratified incidence rates, on
average between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of human cases of rabies (and
therefore rabies deaths) occur in children under 15 years of age. It is
also noteworthy that the more detailed age-stratified epidemiological
studies tend to suggest even higher childhood incidence rates (for example,
60 per cent). Furthermore, most of these bites are never reported and go
unrecognized by both parents and health officials. Consequently, exposed
children often do not receive timely and complete post-exposure treatment.
It is likely, therefore, that a disproportionately high number of young
children contract and die of undiagnosed rabies -- many more than even the
most pessimistic estimates suggest. See:
<http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/zoo/Canine%20Rabies%20in%20Children.pdf>.
During the 5 years 1994-1998, 26 clinically confirmed rabies cases in
humans have been reported to WHO by Zimbabwe, 12 of them laboratory
confirmed. Out of the 8 cases in humans reported in 1998 -- the last
reported year in the WHO tables -- 6 cases were caused by rabid dogs; the
source of the remaining 2 was unknown. During that year, 442 rabies cases
were confirmed by the laboratory in animals in Zimbabwe, including 159
dogs, 8 cats, 145 ruminants, 11 equines, and 119 wild animals - of which 3
were mongoose. - Mod.AS
