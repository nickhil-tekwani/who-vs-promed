Canada
Latest Case Counts
-------------------
Since yesterday, 8 additional probable cases and one death have been
reported in Canada. A total of 44 probable cases with SARS have been
reported in Ontario and British Columbia, including 4 deaths (Table 1). The
number of probable cases by symptom onset date and type of exposure is also
shown (Figure 1). One individual previously classified as a probable case
in Manitoba is no longer being considered for SARS since a specific etiology
has been identified.
Recent Ontario Epidemiologic Findings
--------------------------------
The Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care has reported a total of
42 probable cases of SARS. Of these, most remain hospitalised for isolation
purposes while six are in intensive care. Using the information currently
available, the average age of probable cases is 46.3 years (n=35, range 17
to 82 years), with 24 known females and 17 known males. The majority of
those with severe illness or deaths have occurred in elderly patients with
underlying illness.
While it is difficult to accurately determine the incubation period of the
etiologic agent, given the fact that many of the probable cases in Ontario
may have multiple exposures, the current estimated mean incubation period
is 4 days (estimated range 2 to 10 days).
It is believed that 4 generations of transmission have occurred. The index
case in Ontario was an individual who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at
the Metropole Hotel, where a cluster of SARS cases has since been reported.
Upon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4 members of the
immediate and extended family. A physician who had close contact with
members of this family was also diagnosed with SARS. Following this, cases
were reported in individuals in a hospital setting where some of the first
cases were treated. Most recently, SARS has been reported in a few of the
household contacts of these hospital-associated cases. An isolated case in
Ontario was reported in an individual who had travelled to Asia, but did
not stay in at the Metropole Hotel.
Based on the most recent epidemiologic investigations, nearly all of the
probable cases of SARS that occurred in individuals outside of the initial
family cluster have been linked to exposure to the first hospitalised case
of SARS, on 7 Mar 2003. It is believed that disease transmission occurred
mainly as a result of person-to-person contact. The initial
hospital-associated cases are believed to have contracted the illness as a
result of unprotected contact with the initial cases prior to the
recognition of SARS. Subsequent transmission is thought to have occurred
between households of these hospital-associated cases, and between other
healthcare workers. To date, there has been no evidence of transmission in
the general community.
Other Reports
--------------
A Canadian with SARS [not counted in the official Canadian case count], who
is currently hospitalised in Hong Kong, stayed at the Metropole Hotel. The
first identified probable case of SARS in British Columbia also stayed at
this hotel. The second probable case reported by BC today did not stay at
the hotel but was exposed to a SARS case while in Hong Kong. Both
individuals are currently in isolation and no community transmission has
occurred in this province.
Ontario has declared a provincial emergency and SARS is now a reportable
diseases under Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Act. The province
has introduced a number of public measures in an effort to contain the
spread of SARS. Key public health measures include extensive contact
tracing of persons who may have come in contact with SARS cases, isolation
of suspect and probable cases, and voluntary home quarantine for
asymptomatic contacts. Isolation wards have been established at hospitals
and health care staff are required to observe full airborne and contact
precautions. Health care staff across the province are now alerted to SARS
and have implemented infection control practices to protect themselves and
their patients in an effort to prevent any further infection.
Health Canada is supporting Ontario in its SARS response efforts by
providing epidemiologic and infection control expertise, as well as
emergency supplies as needed. Health Canada in collaboration with the
Provinces and Territories has implemented enhanced surveillance for the
detection of SARS cases, alerted laboratories and initiated special
laboratory investigations in an effort to identify the cause of SARS. In
addition, Health Canada is working quickly to implement a screening
protocol for international travellers in response to the WHO
recommendations to prevent travel-related spread of SARS. Due to recent
concerns regarding the possibility of transmission of SARS aboard aircraft,
Health Canada has also recommended follow-up of all passengers on flights
where a suspect or probable SARS case is identified. For regular updates on
public health actions taken by Health Canada, please see the most recent
update at:

International
-----------
Since 1 Nov 2002, 1557 cases of SARS (1513 outside of Canada) have been
reported to the World Health Organization. The majority of cases are
reported from Guangdong Province and Hong Kong SAR China, Singapore and
Hanoi, Vietnam with Hong Kong presently showing the greatest increase in
cases. Cases of SARS in other parts of the world have occurred in persons
or close contacts of persons who have travelled to these destinations. As
of 30 Mar 2003, 51 deaths have been reported outside of Canada, the
majority (34) of which were reported in Guangdong Province of China. The
total number of cases and deaths in Guangdong was only recently reported in
the WHO cumulative international total.
As of 25 Mar 2003, a cluster of 13 persons with suspected or probable SARS
are known to have stayed at the Metropole Hotel in Hong Kong. These cases
subsequently became index cases in several countries, including Vietnam,
Singapore, the United States, Ireland, and Canada (MMWR Vol 52, No. 12,
March 28, 2003). The visitor from mainland China, a medical doctor from
Guangdong Province who became ill a week before staying at the hotel, is
considered to be the original source of the infection. No further cases
have been linked to the hotel.
The majority of cases have occurred in people who have had very close
contact with other cases including household contacts and health care
workers.
[B] Update 16 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 31 Mar 2003 8:00 PM
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11update16.htm
>
As of 31 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of approximately129
probable or suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in
Ontario, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Alberta and New Brunswick. There
have been 4 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons
who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household
or in a health-care setting. The information contained in this update is
based on the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
Health Canada is changing the way it is reporting probable and suspect
cases of SARS to ensure consistency in reporting across the country.
"Probable" cases of SARS are similar to suspect cases, but often they have
a more severe illness, with progressive shortness of breath and difficulty
breathing, and in some cases, chest x-rays show signs of atypical pneumonia.
A "suspect" case of SARS is a person who fits into one of the following two
categories: a person who develops fever and one or more respiratory
symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,
within 10 days of returning from travel to areas in Asia where SARS cases
are being reported, or a person who develops fever and one or more
respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath or difficulty
breathing, within 10 days of having had close contact with a "probable"
case of SARS (i.e. within one metre).
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
-----------------------------------
Ontario is reporting 51 probable and 58 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 2 probable and 11 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting one suspect case.
Saskatchewan is reporting one suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Here are the most recent developments:
-------------------------
Due to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in
non-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; the
People's Republic of China including the Hong Kong SAR; Singapore; and
Taiwan, Health Canada recommends that persons planning to travel to these
areas should defer all travel until further notice. Health Canada also
recommends alternate routing be considered, when possible, if a traveller
is transiting through the People's Republic of China including the Hong
Kong Special Administrative; City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Singapore; or Taiwan.
Health Canada is aware that health authorities in these affected areas are
making concerted efforts to contain the spread of SARS in their
populations. Given the uncertainties of the current situation, Health
Canada believes it is prudent to await the outcome of national and
international control measures before undertaking travel to these
destinations.
For further information on this travel advisory, please see:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/tmp-pmv/2003/sars0329_e.html>
Effective 1 Apr 2003, Health Canada will launch an initiative to inform all
departing passengers from the Pearson International Airport about symptoms
and contact with persons with SARS through the Health Alert Notice (cherry
cards).
For more information on this initiative, please see: "SARS Screening of
Travellers To and From Canada"
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/2003/2003_11factsheet1.h
tm>
On 31 Mar 2003, Health Canada sent 2 mobile x-ray machines and processors
to Toronto for 2 isolation units that are being set up in non-hospital
facilities.
On 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada deployed 2 additional staff to assist Toronto
Public Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of
SARS cases. This now brings the total number of Health Canada staff
assisting in Ontario to 7. The department has also provided guidelines for
infection control and recommendations on actions for public health settings.

[Presenting updated data is becoming a challenge as the time zone
differences are impacting when data are submitted to WHO vs when data
become available on the various websites. Hence, the above update refers
to 69 cases reported from the USA as of 30 Mar 2003, whereas today's WHO
update (presented in SARS - worldwide (21):cases) gave the USA report of 59
(which was the number of cases reported on 29 Mar 2003).
To further add to the challenge, the 2 above reports on the Health Canada
website were presented. In the first report, there is presentation of data
related to 44 probable cases reported as of 30 Mar 2003. In the second
part of the report, there is information related to approximately 129
suspected and probable cases, creating a challenge to compare one day with
the next... (albeit in the 30 Mar 2003 SARS - Worldwide (20):cases update,
the Health Canada website discussed 98 cases of suspected and probable
cases of SARS, representing an increase of approximately 31 cases).
In the first part of the report [A], the data from 30 Mar 2003 first
available on the website several hours ago are shown. In this presentation,
data on probable cases (44) are presented, along with some preliminary basic
epidemiology -- out of 35 cases (in Ontario), the average (?mean) age is
45.3 years with a range of 17 to 82 years; 24 females and 17 males. There
is also a description of the 4 generations of transmission in Ontario, with
the index case being an individual who was on the 9th floor of the Metropole
Hotel in Hong Kong and is related to the cluster there. Interesting
epidemiologic data, still supporting the observation that close contact has
been necessary for transmission thus far in Ontario.
It would be interesting to see similar epidemiologic data on reported cases
elsewhere. - Mod.MPP]
