Canine visceral leishmaniasis has been confirmed in 21 states. The
discovery was made by scientists at North Carolina State University (NCSU)
College of Veterinary Medicine, the National Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and Walter Reed Army Institute.
Leishmaniasis is a rare, often fatal tropic disease transmitted to people
and other animals. In other parts of the world, leishmaniasis is almost
wholly transmitted by sandflies.
In an interview with DVM Newsmagazine in the October 2000 issue, Dr. Edward
Breitschwerdt, a professor of small animal internal medicine at NCSU, says,
"If we find there is a competent sandfly vector in the southeastern United
States, this becomes an extremely important problem, because that sandfly
will not only be biting dogs, it will be biting humans too."
Breitschwerdt says the disease is very hard to diagnose and until
researchers determine how leishmaniasis is transmitted in the United
States, the threat to human health is not known.
