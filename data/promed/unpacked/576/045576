Fever tick quarantine enlarged in Starr County; reduced in Dimmit County
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The temporary preventive fever tick quarantine zone in south Texas'
Starr County has been enlarged by nearly 24 000 acres (9700
hectares), after fever ticks were found on a premises outside the
county's quarantine zone. Inspectors have used livestock market
records to locate the 94 head of cattle sold by the ranch 28 Mar
2008. Using livestock market records, inspectors have contacted the 9
initial buyers of the cattle, which are considered to be tick-exposed
or infested. The animals are being quarantined, inspected, and
treated to eliminate the spread of fever ticks. Due to cattle
movement, 3 livestock markets also are being subjected to cleaning
and disinfection.

The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Tick Force and the Texas
Animal Health Commission (TAHC) are conducting an epidemiological
investigation to identify and locate any other cattle that have been
moved from the premises during the past year, so the animals can be
inspected, treated and, if necessary, quarantined.

Fever ticks are capable of carrying "babesia," a blood parasite that
can cause "cattle tick fever," a deadly cattle disease that does not
affect humans. The tick was eradicated from the US in l943, but it is
still present in Mexico, and a permanent quarantine zone on the US
side of the Rio Grande is patrolled on horseback by USDA Tick Force
personnel to prevent the introduction of "ticky animals." In 2007,
the fever tick was detected beyond the permanent quarantine, and 3
temporary fever tick quarantine areas were established in Starr and
Zapata counties, and in a contiguous area of Maverick, Dimmit, and
Webb counties.

"Discovering that fever ticks have pushed outside the temporary
preventive quarantine area is very serious and the situation is being
addressed with great urgency by the TAHC and USDA Tick Force," said
Dr Bob Hillman, Texas' state veterinarian and head of the TAHC, the
state's livestock and poultry health regulatory agency. "The TAHC has
expanded the temporary quarantine area in Starr County that
originally encompassed about 40 000 acres (16 200 hectares), and the
USDA Tick Force is inspecting and treating cattle within the newly
enlarged temporary quarantine area to determine the extent of tick
spread."

"Additionally, we are conducting a complete epidemiological
investigation to find cattle moved within the previous year from
newly detected tick-infested premises," said Dr Hillman. "Without
identification on animals, it will slow the process, but we use every
method available, from sale barn, feedlot, and slaughter plant
records, to recollections and hearsay from cattle owners." The TAHC
and USDA last year [2007] successfully traced 783 cattle moved from
premises involved in Maverick, Dimmit, and Webb County temporary
quarantine areas."

Dr Hillman asked for cattle owner cooperation to speed up the
investigation process. "We will move as quickly as possible to
locate, inspect and, if needed, treat and quarantine cattle," said Dr
Hillman. Animals may be moved legally from or within the permanent or
temporary fever tick quarantine areas only after they are inspected
for fever ticks, dipped or sprayed, and permitted for movement by
Tick Force or TAHC personnel."

"Fever ticks have demonstrated their adaptability to hosts besides
cattle, which perpetuates the population of these pests within
tick-infested areas," said Dr Hillman. "The pests have been detected
not only on white-tailed deer, nilgai, and elk, but also on axis,
fallow deer, and aoudad sheep within the permanent and temporary
quarantine zones."

"Although we can dip or spray cattle, treatment for other species is
limited to feeding ivormec-laced corn," he said. "We cannot be
certain all animals get the medicated feed, and the treatment cannot
be used during hunting season, as there is a 60-day withdrawal period
before slaughter. The other wildlife treatment method is the 4-poster
treatment system, where animals rub against pyrethrin-treated posts,
which transfers the chemical to the head, neck, and ears of animals
and kills the ticks. To prevent spreading fever ticks from quarantine
zones during hunting season, hides of harvested animals were
inspected before being hauled away. To address the population growth
of fever ticks on cervid and exotic species, however, we are in dire
need of additional approved products."

"Producers in the quarantined areas have been cooperative, but they
are being hit financially, absorbing the cost of rounding up cattle
time and again," stressed Dr Hillman. "Although inspections and
treatment are provided at no cost to the producer, the cost of
gathering cattle in the south Texas' brush country can be high, due
to the need for cowboys in helicopters and on horseback. Extending
the Starr County quarantine will take in additional ranches, but this
action is necessary, if we are to win the battle against this pest."

The expanded quarantine area in Starr County will now begin at the
intersection of Ebanos Road and US Highway 83 in Los Saenz, moving
west and northwest along Highway 83 to the county line, then
northeast along the county boundary to the northeast corner of the RR
Guerra Las Lomas pasture. The quarantine line turns southeast along
the Las Lomas and Dr Narro fence lines to Loma Blanca Road, where it
runs south to the northwest corner of the Amando Pena pasture
(previously known as the AV Margo pasture). The meanderings of this
pasture's fence line are followed to the northeast, then southeast to
the Sanchez Ranch Road. It then follows the Sanchez Ranch Road east
to the intersection with the San Julian Road. The line follows San
Julian Road south to the intersection with the Ebanos Road and
continues along this road to the quarantine starting point at its
intersection with US Highway 83.

Dr Hillman said there is one bright spot in the battle against fever
ticks -- in Dimmit County. "After thoroughly inspecting livestock in
the area, the USDA Tick Force has determined a small area of the
temporary quarantine in Dimmit County is fever tick-free and can be
excluded from the temporary quarantine zone."

The boundary of the area to be excluded from the temporary quarantine
begins in Eagle Pass at the intersection of FM 1021 (Mines Road) and
US Highway 277 and continues to the junction with Loop 225 (also
known as 5th Street) in Carrizo Springs. The boundary follows Loop
225 to its intersection with US Highway 83 in Carrizo Springs. The
boundary moves south on US Highway 83 until it turns southwest on FM
2688 and continues to FM 1021 (Mines Road). The boundary follows the
Mines Road to its point of origination at the intersection of US
Highway 277 in Eagle Pass.

[Cattle fever ticks (_Boophilus microplus_ and _Boophilus annulatus_)
were likely first introduced to North America as an exotic tick
species, arriving on cattle and horses transported to the New World
by Spanish colonialists. These ticks are capable of carrying and
transmitting bovine babesiosis, once called "Texas fever", which is a
protozoal disease caused by _Babesia bigemina_ or _Babesia bovis_.
Now considered an exotic disease in the United States, bovine
babesiosis has caused significant economic damage to the cattle
industry in the past through production losses and high mortality.

This area along the Texas-Mexico border is a protection zone for all
of Texas and the US. The expansion of this tick range is not a good
sign. USDA is watching carefully and likely will be considering if
further funds may be needed now or in the future if the range of
ticks should expand further.
