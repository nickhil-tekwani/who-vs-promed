Laboratory tests have pinpointed the equine virus suspected of triggering an outbreak of a respiratory illness having killed at least 95 captive wild horses in less than a week at a federal corral in Colorado, US government officials said on Thursday [28 Apr 2022].

Results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests from 2 leading US veterinary diagnostic labs detected the equine influenza virus in nasal and lung tissue samples taken from several horses, the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) said in a statement.

The virus strain, an equine influenza designated "subtype H3N8," is not uncommon in both wild and domestic horses, but is unrelated to an outbreak of a highly contagious bird flu striking wild birds and poultry across the United States in recent days, the BLM said.

The PCR testing also has identified 2 equine herpes viruses (EHV-2 and EHV-5). But BLM said those commonly occur in normal, healthy horses, and it was unclear whether herpes was a contributing factor in the respiratory illness.

The outbreak emerged 23 Apr 2022 at the BLM's Wild Horse and Burro Corrals in Canon City, Colorado, about 120 miles (190 km) southwest of Denver, housing more than 2500 wild mustangs rounded up from public range lands in the region.

Ten horses had died by last Saturday [23 Apr 2022], with the death toll climbing to 95 animals as of Thursday [28 Apr 2022], the BLM said. The entire facility was quarantined while managers separated animals which were sick or exposed to infected horses from those appearing healthy, BLM spokesman Steven Hall said.

Most of the sickened horses had been transported from Rio Blanco County in Colorado, near the Utah state line, in an emergency roundup last fall [2021] following a wildfire in the area, BLM said.

While the H3N8 virus was identified as the likely cause of the outbreak, smoke inhalation and extremely dusty conditions in the pens where the Rio Blanco horses were kept may have left them especially susceptible to respiratory infection, a veterinarian report released by the BLM said. The stricken horses suffered pneumonia-like signs characterized by fluid in their lungs, fever, coughing and labored breathing, according to the vet report.

Wild horse and burro herds are not native to the United States, but are descended from animals freed or abandoned by miners, prospectors and others during settlement of the American West. Numbering an estimated 80 000 in the West, the BLM says the animals must be managed because they foul water supplies and consume forage at the expense of native species.

["Equine influenza, caused by the orthomyxovirus equine influenza A type 2 H3N8 subtype, is one of the most common infectious diseases of the respiratory tract of horses.

"Influenza is endemic in the equine population of the United States and throughout much of the world, with the notable exceptions of New Zealand, Australia, and Iceland. The OIE Expert Influenza Surveillance panel reviews currently circulating strains and makes recommendations for strain inclusion in the vaccine products.

"Equine influenza is highly contagious and the virus spreads rapidly through groups of horses in aerosolized droplets dispersed by coughing or through fomite transmission. The majority of the clinical signs are respiratory and may also include fever, edema and enlarged lymph nodes" (https://aaep.org/guidelines/vaccination-guidelines/risk-based-vaccination-guidelines/equine-influenza).

This is a very contagious virus, and it could easily pass between stressed horses in conditions certainly appearing crowded from a wild horse's point of view. However, to have this many horses die is not only extremely concerning and sad, but also I would think these agents should, and perhaps did, try to minimize the stress on these animals.

Wild horses being rounded up are terrified and stressed, and their one goal is to be free. This extremely stressful situation stresses the animal's immune system, allowing for illness that normally may not be too big a deal, but a stressed animal may be unable to cope with this virus. Putting the wild horses in pens increases their stress, and the density of horses in a certain locale adds further stress and allows the virus to spread through respiratory droplets more easily.

We hope the influenza will subside quickly. Reducing stress on these animals will help. - Mod.TG

By coincidence, a first human case of H3N8 has just been reported from China, which will be the subject of a separate ProMED post:
