Southwestern Pennsylvania bats were part of a new large national study that flagged a die-off nationally of more than 90% of certain bats in less than 10 years.

The bats in question are the northern long-eared, little brown, and tri-colored bats. Researchers also found declines in Indiana bat and big brown bat populations. All of those bat species are found in Pennsylvania. The study was published in Conservation Biology.

The bats were killed by white-nosed syndrome [WNS], which is caused by a fungus that grows in cold, damp, and dark places frequented by hibernating bats in the winter. The fungus grows on the skin of bats, causing them to wake up in the winter, resulting in dehydration, starvation and often death, according to WhiteNoseSyndrome.org.

"The severity of the impact of this disease on bat populations is staggering," said Winifred Frick, chief scientist of Bat Conservation International, one of the paper's authors.

"We found that 9 out of 10 bats of the most vulnerable species are now gone," he said. "Bats are essential to our ecosystems, and our results that stem from working with so many biologists across the United States and Canada focus our efforts on how best to protect these important mammals."

The Pennsylvania Game Commission's Non-Game Mammal Section Supervisor Greg Turner, who is a co-author of the new paper, conducted bat surveys for the study throughout the state, including locations in Westmoreland, Armstrong, Butler, Beaver, Cambria, Fayette, Somerset, Bedford, and Huntingdon counties, and elsewhere in the state.

The large national study drew on the most comprehensive data set on North American bat populations to date, which includes data from over 200 locations in 27 states and 2 Canadian provinces. The study included research conducted over 23 years.

Turner was among the 1st group of biologists to work on tracking the deadly bat disease since it was detected in New York in 2006. Turner started to survey bats for the disease to understand its prevalence in Pennsylvania and published his research.

"At that time, we didn't know if it was a problem that was localized or a new disease," he said. "It's a big thing now that the spread has gone from 5 and 6 states," he said.

White-nose syndrome has since spread to 35 states and 7 Canadian provinces. It has been confirmed in 12 North American bat species.

The study demonstrates the depth of devastation of the white-nose syndrome "so people have a grasp of how serious the problem is," he said.

Pennsylvania is home to 9 bat species, 6 that hibernate and 3 that migrate. All 6 species that hibernate get the white-nose syndrome; 4 of those species are "decimated, with population declines in excess of 95% here," Turner said.

Mortality rates vary by species, region, and hibernation location, he said. For example, little brown bats in New York declined by 91% but declined by 99% in Pennsylvania, he said.

Among the caves Turner and researchers visited was one in Butler County where they found a population of about 100 000 bats hibernating around 2006. Then in 2011, Turner and his crew re-surveyed the Butler cave and found only 40 bats. The loss of the bats will impact the ecosystem as they eat bugs, lots of bugs. A single bat consumes 900 000 to 1 million insects a year, Turner said.

"If you lose a couple million bats, which we did in Pennsylvania, hundreds of millions of insects were not consumed," he said.

The implications of losing a predator that eats that many insects are not yet known but could potentially cause a greater spread of diseases carried by mosquitoes and more agricultural crop damage by insects, Turner said.

Currently, Turner has found "a little" stabilization of bat populations affected by the disease. "There's a lot of movement of the survivors on the landscape now," he said.

Jeremy Coleman, national white-nose syndrome coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and an author of the paper said there is hope. "Through strong collaborative efforts like this analysis, we continue to learn more about the dynamics of this disease. And we will build the infrastructure we need to conserve native bats for future generations."

The article referred to is: Cheng et al. The scope and severity of white-nose syndrome on hibernating bats in North America. Conserv Biol. 2021 Apr 20. doi: 10.1111/cobi.13739.

The abstract reads:
"Assessing the scope and severity of threats is necessary for evaluating impacts on populations to inform conservation planning. Quantitative threat assessment often requires monitoring programs that provide reliable data over relevant spatial and temporal scales, yet such programs can be difficult to justify until there is an apparent stressor. Leveraging efforts of wildlife management agencies to record winter counts of hibernating bats, we collated data for 5 species from over 200 sites across 27 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces from 1995 to 2018 to determine the impact of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a deadly disease of hibernating bats. We estimated declines of winter counts of bat colonies at sites where the invasive fungus that causes WNS (_Pseudogymnoascus destructans_) had been detected to assess the threat impact of WNS. Three species undergoing species status assessment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (_Myotis septentrionalis_, _Myotis lucifugus_, and _Perimyotis subflavus_) declined by more than 90%, which warrants classifying the severity of the WNS threat as extreme based on criteria used by NatureServe. The scope of the WNS threat as defined by NatureServe criteria was large (36% of _Myotis lucifugus_ range) to pervasive (79% of _Myotis septentrionalis_ range) for these species. Declines for 2 other species (_Myotis sodalis_ and _Eptesicus fuscus_) were less severe but still qualified as moderate to serious based on NatureServe criteria. Data-sharing across jurisdictions provided a comprehensive evaluation of scope and severity of the threat of WNS and indicated regional differences that can inform response efforts at international, national, and state or provincial jurisdictions. We assessed the threat impact of an emerging infectious disease by uniting monitoring efforts across jurisdictional boundaries and demonstrated the importance of coordinated monitoring programs, such as the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat), for data-driven conservation assessments and planning." - Mod.PMB
