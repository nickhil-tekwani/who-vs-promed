Bird Flu Virus Infects Pigs in Bali
---------------------------------------
The Team of Veterinary Faculty at Udayana University has found evidence
that the avian influenza (AI) virus has infected pigs in Bali. Wider scale
research is now in process. The AI finding on pigs was due to college
students' research, which diagnosed several ill pigs from May to June 2006.
Out of 20 pigs, 2 were positively infected by H5N1 virus. "The pigs are in
Gianyar and Tabanan," said I Gusti Ngurah Mahardika, a professor at the
faculty, on Fri 6 Oct 2006.
The virus grows in ill pigs, and the pigs cannot be cured by medical
treatment. [At necropsy], there are red blotches on the spleen. By
[immunohistochemistry], the red blotches were viruses on the pigs' tissue.
However, the H5N1 virus was not found in the animals' tissue. "Probably the
virus only passed by, or is called an opportunistic virus," said Mahardika.
The finding has not yet been publicized as a scientific study, but it has
been conveyed to the Bali Breeding Service as a warning.
Virus contagion, according to Mahardika, is likely because with the pattern
of chicken and duck breeding, the animals are free to enter pig stalls. In
Bali, 900 000 pigs live side by side with other cattle.

Cats can carry bird flu, study says
-------------------------------------
Recent studies have revealed that cats can contract the avian influenza
virus and that there is no evidence that migratory birds are responsible
for the spread of the disease.
A study conducted by the Indonesian Environment Information Center (PILI)
in Yogyakarta found that stray cats had caught the H5N1 virus through
contact with infected poultry at traditional markets.
"We are positive that cats can have the virus, although it is yet to be
proven that they can transmit the virus to other animals or humans," PILI
director Iwan Setiawan said on Thursday [5 Oct 2006] after a discussion on
the role of migratory birds in the spreading the virus.
