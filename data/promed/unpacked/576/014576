2000/056 Elimination of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ and
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ from contaminated waters
Laboratory experiments done in Germany showed that peracids (commercial
names Clarmarin and Degaclean) with the addition of a catalase inhibitor
(KH10) can be used to eliminate rapidly _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ and _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests)
from contaminated waters. Trials were done on aqueous suspensions of both
bacteria and also on waste waters from a starch company to which _R.
solanacearum_ had been added.

aqueous suspension and in the sewage water of the starch industry. Journal
