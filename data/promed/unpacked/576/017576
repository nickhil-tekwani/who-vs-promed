[1] COVID strategy
Date: Tue 5 Apr 2022

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and 3 global health partners [the Wellcome Trust, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Global Fund] today [5 Apr 2022] proposed a strategy to manage future risk from COVID, factoring in different scenarios on how the pandemic could evolve and setting ambitious price tags that would enable key policies to take shape.

The strategy, spelled out in a 26-page report [https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/04/A-Global-Strategy-to-Manage-the-Long-Term-Risks-of-COVID-19-516079], was posted on the IMF's website.

Gita Gopinath, the IMF's 1st deputy managing director, said though it's uncertain how the pandemic will unfold, it's clear that the virus will be a long-term problem. "And given the limited resources countries have, we need a new strategy," she said, adding that countries need more comprehensive tools for battling COVID, including tests, vaccines, and treatments, as well as stronger health systems that are better positioned to battle the virus and a number of other diseases.

She said health security is strongly tied to economic security, adding that the IMF's latest estimate in January [2022] put the cumulative global loss from the pandemic at USD 13.8 trillion. Given the lingering drag on the economy, Gopinath said the groups are calling for USD 15 billion in grants this year [2022] to fund the strategy, along with USD 11 billion per year after that to keep the plans going.

Richard Hatchett, CEPI's executive director, said the investments in pandemic preparedness are substantial. "But failure to invest now -- and build on the gains made in the response to COVID-19 -- will result in human and economic costs that will reverberate for generations," he added. And Jeremy Farrar, Wellcome Trust's executive director, said longer-term goals include developing next-generation vaccines that can block transmission and won't require boosters, strengthening genomic surveillance, and enhancing equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. "Leaving any countries unprotected puts us all at risk," he said.

Today's [5 Apr 2022] announcement dovetails with other recent high-level efforts to make the world better prepared for pandemic threats. At a Global Pandemic Preparedness Summit in March [2022], the global community pledged USD 1.5 billion to help CEPI jump-start a 5-year USD 3.5 billion plan to prepare next-generation vaccines against future pandemic threats.

[2] Second booster: immunity longevity
Date: Tue 5 Apr 2022
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/05/health/a-second-booster-helped-protect-older-people-from-omicron-infection-but-waned-quickly-an-israeli-study-says.html


A 2nd booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine provides additional short-term protection against omicron infections and severe illness among older adults, according to a large new study from Israel [see citation below].

But the booster's effectiveness against infection wanes after just 4 weeks and almost disappears after 8 weeks. Protection against severe illness did not ebb in the 6 weeks after the extra dose, but the follow-up period was too short to determine whether a 2nd booster provided better long-term protection against severe disease than a single booster. The study focused on adults ages 60 and older.

The findings, published on Tuesday [5 Apr 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest that additional boosters are likely to provide fleeting protection against omicron infections in older recipients and are consistent with evidence that vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes faster than against severe disease. "For confirmed infection, a 4th dose appeared to provide only short-term protection and a modest absolute benefit," the researchers wrote.

The results come in the midst of a debate over whether and when Americans might need additional boosters. The Food and Drug Administration is convening a panel of outside advisers on Wednesday [6 Apr 2022] to discuss the broader US booster strategy. The rapid spread of the highly transmissible omicron variant, which can evade some of the body's immune defenses, has intensified the discussion.

Last month [March 2022], the FDA authorized 2nd booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for adults ages 50 and older, as well as immunocompromised people ages 12 and older. The agency also authorized an mRNA booster for adults who have already received 2 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. It's likely to be a tough sell: while 66% of Americans have been vaccinated, just 30% have received a booster shot.

It is clear that the omicron variant has blunted the effectiveness of COVID vaccines, but data on the benefits of a 2nd booster remains limited. A previous study from Israel, which has not yet been published in a scientific journal, found that older adults who received a 2nd booster were 78% less likely to die of COVID-19 than those who had received just one booster shot. But scientists criticized the study's methodology, and the benefits of a 2nd booster for young, healthy adults are less clear. Some experts note that most adults who have been vaccinated and boosted once are already likely to be protected from severe illness and death.

On 2 Jan [2022], Israel authorized a 4th dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adults ages 60 and older and members of other high-risk populations who had received their 3rd shots at least 4 months earlier. Israel's vaccination campaign has relied heavily on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The new study is based on records from the Israeli Ministry of Health on more than 1.2 million older adults who were eligible for the 4th shot between 10 Jan and 2 Mar [2022], when omicron was the dominant variant in the country. The researchers compared the rate of confirmed virus infections and cases of severe COVID-19 among those who had received a 4th dose to those who had received just 3 doses.

Protection against infection appeared to peak 4 weeks after the 4th shot: the rate of confirmed infections was twice as high in the 3-dose group as in the 4-dose group. By 8 weeks after the 4th shot, however, the additional protection against infection had almost disappeared. Rates of severe disease were 3.5 times higher in the 3-dose group than the 4-dose group 4 weeks after the booster shot, the researchers found. That protection did not appear to wane and actually rose slightly by the 6th week after the shot, when rates of severe disease were 4.3 times higher in the 3-dose group. But the study covered a relatively short period, and whether the benefits against illness persist remains unknown. The study did not report data on deaths.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20APR5WORLD7_1649287515.pdf. The following commentary is based on these data. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, 22 countries -- South Korea (286 243), France (203 021), Germany (187 256), Italy (88 914), Australia (60 944), Viet Nam (54 995), UK (50 624), the USA (32 049), Brazil (27 331), Spain (27 079), Thailand (24 252), Switzerland (21 217), Greece (18 456), Netherlands (14 018), Russia (13 947), Austria (12 946), New Zealand (12 635), Turkey (12 213), Malaysia (12 017), Canada (11 547), Reunion (10 996), and Israel (10 241) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4217 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 3 Apr 2022 to late 4 Apr 2022).

A total of 42 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 42 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 21.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 24.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 1.4% increase in daily reported cases and 17.6% decrease in reported deaths. The overall global trend shows decreasing cases and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.29 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 494.14 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.18 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
