Bolivian health authorities have decreed a red alert in the city of
Bermejo, bordering Argentina, where an outbreak of [hantavirus infection]
caused the death of two persons. A 36-year-old woman was dismissed last
Wednesday after being detected with symptoms of [hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome = HPS], said the local director of epidemiologic studies.
The two fatal victims were a 38-year-old man and another 75. Vice Minister
of Health of Bolivia Jose Henricke said in La Paz that doctors have not
confirmed another case [as HPS]. Henricke said the old man died due to a
breathing problem and ear hemorrhage and apparently did not have any
contact with rodents nor had gone on outings to the countryside.
The National Center of Tropical Diseases (CENETROP) confirmed that a
hantavirus was the cause of these deaths, and health authorities arranged
to begin rodent control efforts.

[Three cases is more like a cluster than an "outbreak". Doubtful that the
elderly male died from ear hemorrhage, although that might have been one of
his clinical signs. That he had not had contact with rodents is doubtful;
perhaps not direct contact, but contact nonetheless -- unless this was
transmitted human-to-human.
It would be useful to know which of the many hantaviruses is causing this
problem in Bolivia. Perhaps Brian Hjelle has some information? - Mod. CHC]
