The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday asked for help in
warning 966 people who participated in the Springfield, Ill., Ironhorse
Triathlon [run, bike and swim for hours which means these people are in
great shape - Mod.PC] on June 21 and 850 athletes from the 1998 Bally Total
Fitness USTS Triathlon in Madison, Wisconsin, on July 5. Five people from
the competitions became ill with fever and other symptoms consistent with
leptospirosis, an illness that, if left untreated, could result in liver or
kidney damage. More than 1,800 participating athletes from 44 states may be
at risk.
The agency did not say how the athletes were exposed. Leptospirosis is
caused by a microorganism spread by infected animals, especially rodents or
dogs [cattle and pigs are also common hosts for certain serovars such as
hardjo, pomona and grypotyphosa - Mod.PC].
The CDC said symptoms include fever, chills, headache and a rash, any of
which can appear between four and 19 days after exposure.
Illinois and Wisconsin health officials are also investigating.

[Leptospirosis often results from exposure to urine-contaminated feed or
water sources - farm water troughs, contaminated drinking water sources or
exposure to contaminated lakes or streams. Epidemics of leptosprirosis
follow a seasonal pattern, being more common in summer and fall in
temperate climates. Furthermore, they have a cyclic nature resulting from
the waxing and waning host population dynamics over a period of years.
Climatic conditions, particularly rainfall are also important determinants.

The two athletic events were geographically separated by several hundred
miles, so what is the connection? How many cases are associated with each
event? Whatever the connection, the important thing is that leptospirosis
can be dangerous if left unattended, so exposed triathletes should take
appropriate action. - Mod.PC]
