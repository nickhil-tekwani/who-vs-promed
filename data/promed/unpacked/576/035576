The 7-year-old son of a Thai farmer who died 2 days ago of H5N1 avian
influenza also has the virus, but there is no evidence that the boy
caught it from his father, according to news services. Reuters and
Agence France-Presse reports said the boy tested positive for the
virus, but they didn't say what test was used or where it was done.
The boy is hospitalized but is expected to recover. "There is no
evidence that the boy contracted the disease from his father," said
Siriraj Hospital Director Prasit Watanapa, as quoted in the Agence
France Presse report.
The father fell ill after slaughtering sick chickens. Prasit said the
boy "had close contact with the virus" from being around the
chickens, AFP reported. "The H5N1 viruses found in the boy and the
father were the same strain that has been found for the last 2 years,
with no signs of a mutation," Prasit added. Reuters reported that
the 7-year-old was treated with the anti-flu drug
oseltamivir (Tamiflu) early in his illness. The boy has recovered
his appetite and his fever has resolved, the story said.
If the boy in fact has avian flu, his illness is the 19th case in
Thailand since the disease began spreading in East Asia in late 2003.
The country has had 13 deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO),
which has not yet confirmed the boy's case, currently lists a total
of 118 human cases, with 61 deaths.
In Britain, meanwhile, a parrot that was imported from South America
and died in quarantine tested positive for a highly pathogenic H5
avian flu virus, government officials announced today. The parrot had
been imported from Suriname, the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said in a news release. It was part of a
shipment of 148 parrots and "soft bills" that arrived 16 Sep 2005.
All the birds in the consignment were being destroyed, DEFRA said.
Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds said, "The confirmed case
does not affect the UK's disease-free status because the disease has
been identified in imported birds during quarantine." As an
additional precaution, the few people who had contact with the birds
in the quarantine unit were being given antiviral drugs, the statement said.
H5N1 avian flu has not been reported in the UK or in South America.
DEFRA said no form of avian flu has been confirmed in Britain since
1992. Officials said another serious avian illness, Newcastle
disease, has been detected in imported quarantined birds and
successfully contained 5 times previously.
In Indonesia, a 63-year-old man and his 22-year-old son who were
suspected of having avian flu have tested negative, according to an
Agence France Presse report today. The report of their cases
yesterday had prompted talk about a possible family cluster. "The
pneumonia they are suffering from was not caused by bird flu," a
health ministry official named Hariyadi Wibonoso was quoted as
saying. He said further confirmatory tests would be conducted in Hong
Kong. The WHO has recognized 5 cases of avian flu in Indonesia,
including 3 deaths. But government officials have described several
more cases as probable on the basis of local tests.

A Thai boy tested positive for avian influenza on Friday [21 Oct
2005], but doctors said he was recovering and there was no sign he
caught the virus from his infected father, who died earlier this
week, calming fears of a human pandemic. The boy, 7, who was treated
with the anti-flu drug Tamiflu in the early stages of his infection,
had recovered his appetite and his temperature had returned to
normal, although he would remain under observation for 2 weeks, doctors said.
"There is no evidence to prove the boy became infected from his
father," Prasit Watanapa, director of Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital,
told reporters. "This boy had direct contact in the infected area."
The boy's father became Thailand's 13th official bird flu victim when
he died on Wednesday in a resurgence of the virus in east and
Southeast Asia which has fanned fears of the H5N1 strain mutating
into a form that jumps from person to person.
Since breaking out in late 2003 in South Korea, H5N1 has killed more
than 60 people in 4 Asian countries and reached as far west as
European Russia, Turkey and Romania, tracking the paths of migratory
birds. Romania said on Friday it had detected a new suspected case
close to its eastern border with Moldova as governments in Europe and
Africa move to halt the spread of the virus. The World Health
Organisation sought to ease fears by saying the risk to humans in
Europe remains "very low".
"The crisis ... may seem more intense now because birds in Europe
have become infected," WHO spokesman Dick Thompson told reporters in
Geneva. "But the risk is pretty much the same as it has been -- it is
very low to humans -- but we're worried about the transformation of
the virus into a human pandemic strain," he added.
In Indonesia, fears fanned by the health minister about a possible
human-to-human transmission eased after tests on a father and son
hospitalised in Jakarta proved negative. In [the virus'] current
form, humans need to be in prolonged close contact with an infected
animal, usually in a confined space, to catch the disease.
Amid growing fears about the spread of the virus, Tamiflu's maker,
Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche AG, has come under pressure to pump
up output by any means possible. The company agreed on Thu [20 Oct
2005] to meet 4 generic drug makers with a view to possible
[cooperative efforts]. Nevertheless, experts say Tamiflu, which is
generically known as oseltamivir, cannot be regarded as a "cure-all"
for H5N1 as it must be administered in the early stages of infection
-- and will in some cases not work due to anti-viral resistance.
"There are lots of people who are given Tamiflu and it is not seen to
be particularly effective," the WHO's Thompson said. "We know from
experience with this drug that it is most effective very shortly
after symptoms develop."
The WHO says 61 people have now died of bird flu since the H5N1
strain resurfaced in 2003 after a brief outbreak in Hong Kong in
1997. So far 41 have died in Viet Nam, 13 in Thailand, 4 in Cambodia
and 3 in Indonesia. 6 people died in the Hong Kong outbreak.

[The deaths of the father and son in Thailand have been attributed to
avian H5N1 influenza virus infection on the basis of undefined local
tests. These cases should be regarded only as suspected cases until
confirmatory laboratory diagnostic tests have been completed at the
WHO-designated reference laboratory in Hong Kong. These 2 cases in
Thailand are not regarded as a "cluster," in contradistinction to the
recent father-and-son cases in Indonesia, which proved not to be due
to avian influenza virus infection. There is still no firm evidence
that the H5N1 virus has evolved to become easily transmissible
between humans anywhere in East Asia. - Mod.CP]
