Fourth and Youngest Case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in Utah
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials in the eastern half of the state are investigating Utah's
youngest case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome: a 17-year-old from Duchesne
County. He was infected during the past week and a half, said his doctor,
Mark Mitchell of Roosevelt. The unidentified boy appears to be improving.
Mitchell said the boy was reported in serious condition on Wed 26 Jun 2002
at Provo's Utah Valley Regional Hospital, where he was taken on Sunday
morning after being treated at the Roosevelt-based Uintah Basin Hospital.
Utah's youngest previous hantavirus case was a 19-year-old patient in 1994,
said the state Department of Health. In this latest case, a chest X-ray
confirmed he had a life-threatening respiratory infection; later blood tests
confirmed a hantavirus infection.
Joseph Shaffer, director of the TriCounty Health Department, said the cause
[source] of the infection is still unknown. An investigation is under way to
determine if the teenager was exposed to rodent droppings recently or got
the disease through some other means. Information from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention says hantavirus is usually [contracted]
through rodent feces or urine that becomes airborne -- often in confined
spaces such as sheds, crawl spaces or garages -- and then inhaled. Patients
can also catch the virus by touching their nose or mouth after handling
hantavirus-contaminated materials. Symptoms include fever, chills, headache,
muscle aches, and occasionally nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Utah has recorded 4 hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases so far this year
[2002]. In early May, a 41-year-old Cedar City woman died 5 hours after
being admitted to a hospital with flu-like symptoms. This year 2 non-fatal
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases were reported in Salt Lake and Wayne
counties, the state health department said.
