A woman in Chelyabinsk has contracted West Nile [WN] virus infection
without any travel history out of the province. She was hospitalized
several days ago with headache and fever. At first, doctors suspected
meningitis; however, the diagnosis was rejected later on. Samples
were taken for testing for any neurotoxic infection, and the results
for West Nile virus infection were positive. This case was the 1st in
the region in all history.

Currently, the specialists are trying to estimate the probability of
more cases, and the government is discussing the need for screening
of humans, birds and mosquitoes.

There were 448 registered West Nile virus infection cases in Russia
between 7 Jul-15 Sep [2010], 6 of which were fatal. The most of cases
happened in Volgograd, Rostov and Voronezh oblasts, with only few
cases in Krasnodar krai, Kalmikia republic, Astrakhan and Chelyabinsk
oblasts. The most affected age group are the elderly, and the peak of
morbidity came during the last 2/3rds of August 2010.

[These WN virus infections in people are scattered around
southwestern Russia. If the decision is made to screen birds and
mosquitoes, the results would be of interest.

There are 3 new cases of West Nile [virus] infection in Bucharest and
an additional 2 cases detected in Cluj, transmitted by mosquito bite,
the Ministry of Health (MOH) stated. Thus, in Romania, 41 cases of
West Nile [virus] infection have been confirmed, 4 of them fatal.

Ministry experts estimated that onset of the cooler season will
decrease the impact by itself.

The county situation is as follows: Dolj 1 case, Alba 2 cases, Buzau
1 case, Cluj 2 cases, Ialomita 4 cases, Galati 1 case, Sibiu 3 cases,
Bucuresti 9 cases, Teleorman 1 case, Mures 3 cases, Constanta 8
cases, Calarasi 1 case, Iasi 3 cases, Vrancea 1 case, and Mehedinti 1 case.
