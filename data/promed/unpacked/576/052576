Pesticide poisoning was the likely cause of the mysterious deaths of at least 18 people in a southwestern Nigerian town earlier this week, the World Health Organization said on Sunday [19 Apr 2015]. The "current hypothesis is cause of the event is herbicides," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said in a tweet. "Tests done so far are negative for viral and bacterial infection," he added.

The victims began showing symptoms early last week in what Ondo state spokesman Kayode Akinmade called a "mysterious disease", prompting fears of a new infectious disease outbreak in a region ravaged by Ebola. The victims, whose symptoms included headache, weight loss, blurred vision and loss of consciousness, died within a day of falling ill in the town of Ode-Irele, in south western Ondo state.

The Ondo state health commissioner, Dayo Adeyanju, told AFP on Saturday [18 Apr 2015] that 23 people had been affected. Akinmade said health officials and experts from the government and aid agencies, as well as WHO epidemiologists, had arrived in Ode-Irele to investigate the deaths. The tests were carried out at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, WHO said.

The Ondo State Government says a strange disease that has killed over a dozen people since its outbreak on [15 Apr 2015] in Ode-Irele, Irele Local Government Area of the state, is not contagious and could be a result of ethanol poisoning. The commissioner for health in the state, Dayo Adeyanju, stated this on Sunday [19 Apr 2015] at a news conference in Akure.

He said findings from postmortems carried out on the victims and other laboratory tests revealed that the disease was neither epidemic nor contagious.

According to the commissioner, preliminary reports showed ethanol poison found in the systems of all the victims. "Our investigations revealed that the victims, who are commercial motorcyclists, gathered at some local joints to take alcoholic substance mixed with roots and some other local herbs on the eve of the outbreak of the disease. I can assure you that the disease is in no way contagious. The fact that none of the caregivers has contracted the disease has greatly underscored this point. Therefore, the fear of spread does not arise and should be discouraged. We strongly suspect ethanol poison and in view of this, we have ordered for another toxicology test for surviving victims," Mr Adeyanju said.

Ebola Alert, an evidence-driven group of volunteer professionals who helped with the Ebola virus disease interventions in Nigeria, had said on Friday [17 Apr 2015] that samples taken from victims and tested in a laboratory in Lagos tested negative to Ebola and 5 other deadly diseases. "#OndoX samples tests negative for Ebola Virus, Yellow Fever, Lassa Fever Virus, Rift Valley Fever Virus, Dengue Virus, West Nile Virus," the organisation said.

The Ondo commissioner, who said that there had been no report of new cases in the last 3 days, explained that 18 out of the 23 people affected have died. He said the 5 survivors, who have currently gone blind, have been referred to the University Teaching Hospital, Ibadan, for further examination and monitoring.

Mr Adeyanju said he would not join issues with traditionalists who believe that the outbreak of the disease was because some youth stole from shrine of some gods. The commissioner, however, said that the dead would be buried in body bags to curtail any spread of the disease.

[Although the 2nd news report above says the toxin involved in the Ondo outbreak is ethanol, most likely the alcoholic toxin that was meant is methanol. Methanol intoxication commonly causes diminished visual acuity, which can progress to blindness. Methanol, also known as wood alcohol, is a commonly used industrial solvent. Most methanol poisonings occur as a result of drinking beverages adulterated with methanol. Methanol intoxication may also result from inhalation of high concentrations of methanol vapor or from skin contact (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ershdb/emergencyresponsecard_29750029.html).

A discussion of methanol poisoning can be found in moderator TG's comments in ProMED-mail post Methanol poisoning, fatal - India: (UP) 20150113.3088258. - Mod.ML
