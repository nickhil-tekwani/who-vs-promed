Referring to the JEV case in Belgium ex Shanghai,China, it should
not be that surprising that a case occurs in suburban or peri-urban
areas. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, _Cx.gelidus_, and related vector
species often breed in abandoned rice fields, puddles, or other wet
areas that can be found in rapidly expanding suburban areas in
developing countries. This situation is very common as new housing
developments swallow up formerly rural areas. This situation would be
especially true if amplifying hosts such as young pigs are being
fattened for market in the same general areas, or if ardeid birds,
natural amplifiers, were abundant nearby.
In the mid-1980s, I and my colleagues (see references below) found a
focus of some 20 cases in suburban Bangkok. Most of the cases
occurred in children under 18 living in nice suburban houses, but
with lots of mosquito breeding areas located within 1/4 mile.
Two references that elaborate upon this sort of outbreak are as follows:
1) Gingrich, J.B., Nisalak, A., et al.,1992. Japanese encephalitis
virus in Bangkok factors influencing vector = infections in three
suburban communities. J. Med. Entomol. 29: 436.
2) Gingrich, J.B., Nisalak, A., et al. 1987. A longitudinal study of
Japanese encephalitis in suburban Bangkok,Thailand. Southeast Asian
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health 18(4):558-566.

[Dr. Gingrich provides valuable evidence in support of the
possibility of JE cases in the urban, peri-urban, or suburban setting
in developing countries like China and Thailand. The mosquitoes,
_Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, _Cx.gelidus_, and related vector species,
which are the most effective for transmission of JE, can be found in
abundance in suburban Bangkok, which is situated within the tropics,
whereas Shanghai is of the temperate zone. The geographic difference
could lead to some variation in the ecology of the vectors. More
information about the detailed study of mosquitoes in line with JE
virus endemics and epidemics from China will be appreciated. - Mod.RY]
[Over 28 mosquito species belonging to several genera have been found
infected with Japanese encephalitis virus. However, the most
important and efficient vectors are _Culex tritaeniorynchus_, _Cx.
gelidus_, _Cx. fuscocephala_and _Cx. vishnui_, all of which are found
in China, but I am not sure whether the last 2 species are found as
far north as Shanghai.
All these vectors commonly breed in rice fields, but they can also be
found in other types of larval habitats such as in marshes, pools of
water, especially those formed adjacent to streams, and hence their
larval habitats can extend to urban or semi-urban areas. - Mod.MS]
