The national capital logged its first fatality due to malaria, which occurred in the last 2 years. A 3 6-year-old man from Najafgarh succumbed to the disease, a report from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi showed on [Thu 5 Jan 2023].

The fatality was confirmed by the death review committee this week, which occurred on [13 May 2022] at Venkateshwar Hospital. This is the 2nd death recorded in the national capital after 2020, when one fatality was reported that year. In fact, the city has recorded only 2 deaths since 2017 including this year's. There was not a single death due to malaria in Delhi in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021, and in 2020 one patient died, as per the data from MCD. The city recorded 263 cases of malaria in 2022, the MCD report said.

[Najafgarh is a town in the southwest of the national capital territory of Delhi, and Venkateshwar Hospital is in West Delhi. India has achieved >75% reduction in malaria morbidity and mortality since 2000, according to the World Malaria Report https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1677601, but the transmission of the disease still occurs even in the capital city.

The above article does not indicate which species of malaria was responsible for the fatal case, which would be of interest because _Plasmodium vivax_ is only rarely fatal, in contrast to _P. falciparum_, which is not prevalent in Delhi, but instead concentrated in eastern and northeastern states of India with significant populations of marginalized tribal groups living in or near large tracts of forested land. - Mod.LL
