[Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

The OIE Terrestrial Code Chapter 10.4 on Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses, Article 10.4.1 defines "poultry" as 'all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose. Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, racing, exhibitions, competitions or for breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry.' (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.4.htm)

In this case, the premises was a breeding farm and hunting preserve containing approximately 40 000 mallard ducks and 7000 to 8000 pheasants. Routine surveillance detected evidence of exposure to the virus. As expected for these species of birds, neither the ducks nor the pheasants showed signs of illness. The authorities, however, are conducting further investigations to ensure no commercial chicken or layer flocks have been exposed. - Mod.CRD
