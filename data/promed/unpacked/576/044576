1st report of _Monilinia fructicola_ in Spain
---------------------------------------------
In Hungary in October 2005, symptoms of brown rot
were observed on imported peaches from Italy and
Spain. The infected fruits had been bought at a
market and several supermarkets in Budapest and
Godollo. Based on morphological characteristics
and PCR (according to EPPO diagnostic protocol
PM7/18), the pathogen was identified as
_Monilinia fructicola_ (Petroczy & Palkovics,
2006). In 2006, the NPPO of Spain confirmed the
occurrence of _M. fructicola_ (EPPO A2 list) on
its territory. _M. fructicola_ was found in peach
trees (_Prunus persica_) in 2 adjacent
localities: Ivars de Noguera (Provincia de
Lleida, Cataluna) and Castillonroy (Provincia de
Huesca, Aragon). A focus zone was delimited
within a radius of 5 km around the initial
finding, and intensive surveys will be carried
out in spring 2006 to delimit the extent of the
infestation. Another zone of 10 km radius was
also delimited and phytosanitary measures will be
applied in orchards, packing stations and
nurseries to prevent any further spread of the
disease.
The situation of _Monilinia fructicola_ in Spain
can be described as follows: Present, first
reported in 2006, isolated outbreak found in
_Prunus persica_ in 2 adjacent localities
(Catalu�Arag� under official control.

[The fruit of the crop plant peach, _Prunus
persica_, is susceptible to the disease brown
rot, both on and off the tree. The disease is
caused by species of the fungus _Monilinia_. This
article describes the 1st report of _M.
fructicola_ on peach trees in Spain in the
regions of Cataluna and Aragon. This report
should be read alongside another posting
[20060303.0672] which references a first report
of _M. fructicola_ in Hungary on peach fruit
imported from Spain. In that report no clarity
was provided as to the original source of the
stored and shipped fruit, and it is quite
possible that Spain was not the origin of the
pathogen despite the facts presented in this
posting. Dr. Laszlo Palkovics of the Department
of Plant Pathology, Corvinus University, Budapest
and an author of the Hungary report (see citation
above) wrote to me "We detected the pathogen in
late autumn [2005] in Hungary" and "I do not
think that we could find any peach fruit in late
October [2005] in Europe", implying that it is
unlikely the detection in Hungary was from fruit
collected from Spanish peach trees despite the
new knowledge that some are infected with _M.
fructicola_.
