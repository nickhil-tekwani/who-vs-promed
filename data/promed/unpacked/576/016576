At least one person is dead and 16 others ill across Canada from a
bacterial infection that can be fatal to the infirm, the elderly, and
unborn children -- and could be linked to a massive, nationwide
recall of ready-to-eat meat products made by food giant Maple Leaf Foods.

Health authorities in Ontario are dealing with 12 confirmed cases of
listeriosis, a disease caused by the bacterium _Listeria
monocytogenes_ -- often found in soil, vegetation, animal feed, and
feces, and recently in certain processed meats produced by a Maple
Leaf plant in Toronto.

Listeriosis was the "underlying cause of death" in the case of the
one known fatality, said Dr David Williams, Ontario's acting chief
medical officer of health. Williams provided no specifics except to
say the victim was from southern Ontario. The number of confirmed
cases, which seem to consist primarily of nursing home residents,
could grow as health units across the province continue to submit
reports on the disease, he added. "The pattern was people in certain
long-term care facilities" across southern Ontario, Williams said.
"The median age in the males is 76 and in the females is 80."

Nursing homes, deli counters, and restaurants, including McDonald's
and Mr Sub, are among the establishments where the meat products --
which include turkey, ham, corned beef, and roast beef -- were
distributed. Maple Leaf (TSX:MFI) spokeswoman Linda Smith said the
company is taking all the necessary precautions, including shutting
down the plant, providing additional food safety training for
employees, and ensuring the public is aware of the situation.

"This is a company that has a culture of food safety," Smith said.
"We're taking appropriate, broad, comprehensive, and definitive
action as it relates to this facility. This involves people -- we
want people to understand there's a recall, we want people to have
that information." The recall is costing the company approximately
[CAD] 2 million [USD 1.9 million], Smith added.

Williams said there are an additional 16 probable or suspected cases
in the province [Ontario]. "I strongly advise the public, especially
those at high risk for listeriosis ... to make sure they avoid
consuming these products," he said in a statement. "I have also asked
all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their
jurisdictions to be on alert for cases. All suspect and confirmed
cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public
health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of
notification of report."

Consumption of food tainted with listeria can lead to high fever,
severe headache, neck stiffness, and nausea. The illness is a
particular danger to pregnant women and their unborn children, the
elderly, and people with weakened immune systems, cancer, diabetes,
kidney disease, or AIDS.

Symptoms usually appear within 2 to 30 days, and up to 90 days after
consuming contaminated food, according to the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency. The average incubation period is about 3 weeks,
says the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.

The remaining 4 confirmed cases include 2 in BC [British Columbia],
one in Saskatchewan, and one in Quebec. Health inspectors in all 4
provinces were working with Health Canada and the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency [CFIA] to confirm the source of the outbreak.

Margaret Ringland, of the Ontario Association of Non-Profit Homes and
Services for Seniors, which represents 180 non-profit homes in the
province, said she's had no reports of suspicious deaths at the
association's facilities. "They would simply not use the meat; they
would move into other foods, it's as simple as that," Ringland said.
"People aren't going to take a chance. The products they're talking
about aren't ones that are a heavy part of menus in most of the
homes. I haven't heard from anybody who has an issue over this."

CFIA spokesman Garfield Balsom said he couldn't say how long it would
take to establish any possible links between Maple Leaf products and
the bacteria. "To predict when you're going to complete an
investigation is practically impossible," he said. "With the tomato
issue in the United States, it went on for 3 or 4 months."

Maple Leaf is recalling all products prepared at the plant since [2
Jun 2008] and shutting down the plant through the weekend [23-24 Aug
2008] for a comprehensive sanitization, Smith said. Employees are
also to receive additional food safety training, and the 2 production
lines in question are to be dismantled, she added. On Sunday [17 Aug
2008], the meat packer said it had discovered listeria in Sure Slice
roast beef and corned beef produced at the Toronto facility and
issued a recall on those products.

Brand names for some of the recalled products include Schneiders,
Sure Slice, Deli Gourmet, and Burns Bites. A complete list of
affected products is available on both the Maple Leaf Foods website
(<http://www.mapleleaf.com>) and that of the CFIA
(<http://www.inspection.gc.ca>). The 23 products involved in the
expanded recall carry an establishment number of 97B and have
best-before dates ranging from [30 Sep 2008 to 1 Jan 2009].

Balsom said the CFIA first became aware of possible problems when it
was notified of a listeriosis outbreak on [6 Aug 2008] by a
particular health unit; subsequent investigation led them to Maple
Leaf's Toronto facility, he said.

McDonald's Canada said Wednesday [20 Aug 2008] it is temporarily
removing its turkey BLT [bacon/lettuce/tomato] sandwich from its menu
as a "precautionary measure" -- the only item on the restaurant
chain's menu that is affected. "We apologize for any inconvenience
this may cause, but food safety and quality at McDonald's will not be
compromised," the company said in a release. "We are closely
monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency."

The complete list of affected products, including individual product
codes and best-before dates, is as follows:

[A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail no.
20071230.4186. Though unclear in the news release above, 17 cases of
listeriosis have apparently been confirmed: 13 in Ontario, 2 in
British Columbia, and one each in Saskatchewan and Quebec
(<http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080820/mlf_recall_080820/20080820?hub=CTVNewsAt11>).


The company has recalled 23 packaged meat products, including sliced
cooked turkey breast, roast beef, and salami. _Listeria_ has not been
found in all of the 23 products now on recall, but the company is
recalling items that share a common production line with the tainted
meats
(<http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080820/mlf_recall_080820/20080820?hub=CTVNewsAt11>).
The cause of the outbreak at present remains unknown; linkage between
the affected products and human illness likely will await genotyping
the isolated strains.
