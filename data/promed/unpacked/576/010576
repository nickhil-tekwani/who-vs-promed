[2] Research
- Mosquito gene identified, linked with human scent detection
Date: Mon 1 Apr 2019
Source: Al Jazeera [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/mosquito-scent-discovery-change-billion-lives-190401082408931.html


Researchers in the USA have genetically modified mosquitoes to make humans less attractive to them, a discovery that could dramatically reduce the spread of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria, and Zika fever.

Female mosquitoes have been long known to use an array of sensory information to find people to bite. They can sense exhaled carbon dioxide from as far as 10 m [32.8 ft] away and are also able to detect body odour, heat, and moisture.

But new research, published in the journal Current Biology, has shown that an acidic component in human sweat plays a key role in attracting the insect. "We wanted to understand the genetic basis of how the mosquitoes detect their human hosts," Matthew DeGennaro, a mosquito neurobiology researcher at Florida International University, told Al Jazeera.

The scientists identified a gene - known as Ir8a - expressed in the mosquito's antenna. This gene appears to allow female mosquitoes, the ones that suck blood, to smell lactic acid, a particular acidic vapour in human sweat.

Using advanced CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology, the researchers were able to disrupt that gene, making the female _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes significantly less interested in humans. The genetically modified mosquitoes were less likely to detect and bite humans, making them much less likely to spread mosquito-borne illnesses.

For a species such as _Aedes aegypti_, which lives alongside half of the world's population and spreads diseases that kill millions of people each year, this genetic modification has huge potential health benefits.

"The transmission of diseases like dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and malaria can be blocked if we stop these mosquitoes from biting us," said DeGennaro.

While the release of genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild to combat the spread of dengue fever has been a controversial practice, this latest research is not only focused on the potential of cross-breeding them with wild populations, the researchers say their work can also offer a more advanced understanding of how mosquitoes hunt and feed on their human targets and will allow them to develop improved mosquito repellents. These could include life-saving perfumes or scents that would disrupt mosquitoes' sense of smell and protect people from being bitten.

"Odours that mask the IR8a pathway could enhance the efficacy of current repellents like DEET or picaridin. In this way, our discovery may help make people disappear as potential hosts for mosquitoes," said DeGennaro.

In the same way, the researchers say they may be able to use the discovery to overstimulate parts of the insect's detection system and use the scent to lure them away from humans and into traps. The effect is "like getting on an elevator with someone who has put on way too much cologne," Larry Zwiebel, a biologist at Vanderbilt University, told US broadcaster NPR.

In February [2019], the WHO warned that an emerging resistance to insecticides could lead to a large increase in malaria cases and mortality. The effects of climate change, which will make more parts of the world hospitable to mosquitoes and the diseases they spread, are also expected to hamper control efforts.

It's in this context that new and innovative insect-control methods like those developed by the Florida researchers are going to become increasingly important.

- Effects of dengue immunity on Zika virus infection
Date: Mon 25 Mar 2019
Source: Nature [abridged, edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00868-6


Zika virus (ZIKV) was discovered in Africa in 1947. Its impact on public health seemed restricted to sporadic local outbreaks associated with an illness characterized by mild fever [1]. But in 2013-2014, ZIKV was introduced into the Americas, where it spread quickly. The large number of infections that occurred during the resulting epidemic revealed a previously unappreciated link between ZIKV infection of pregnant women and a devastating congenital neurodevelopmental disease in their babies [2]. The factors contributing to the rapid spread and disease severity observed in this outbreak remain elusive. Writing in Science, Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. [3] provide a high-resolution view of the epidemiology of Zika disease in a Brazilian community during the 2015 epidemic. They also explore how prior infection with a related mosquito-borne virus contributes to the risk of ZIKV infection and disease.

ZIKV belongs to a group of evolutionarily related flaviviruses that includes yellow fever virus and dengue virus (DENV). Flavivirus infection triggers the production of antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), some of which can neutralize the virus's ability to infect cells. Antibodies can also coordinate other components of the host's immune response that destroys virus-infected cells, even when they cannot inhibit virus infection directly. Some antibodies are specific for a single flavivirus type, whereas others react against several flavivirus species (this is called cross-reactivity). The extensive antibody cross-reactivity against flaviviruses has complicated the development of laboratory diagnostics to identify individual virus types [4].

Antibodies help to protect individuals against flavivirus infections. Nonetheless, in rare circumstances, antibodies elicited by DENV infection might exacerbate dengue disease in people infected for a 2nd time with a different variety (serotype) of DENV [5]. DENV circulates in many of the same parts of the world as ZIKV, including South and Central America. The unexpected appearance of congenital disease following the introduction of ZIKV into the Americas raised the possibility that cross-reactive antibodies produced during a prior exposure to DENV worsen the severity of Zika through similar mechanisms to those that increase the severity of dengue after a 2nd DENV infection [6].

Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. investigated the dynamics of a Zika outbreak in a DENV-endemic region of Brazil. The study focused on a community of people living in the city of Salvador who were taking part in a long-term study of DENV. Because molecular assays provide a limited window in which to diagnose infection, the authors opted to use serological assays to measure antibody levels at different time points. They measured the levels of antibodies against ZIKV in individual serum samples collected before, during and after the 2015 Zika epidemic, to establish the prevalence of infection among the study population.

Antibodies are grouped into 5 classes and several subclasses. The anti-ZIKV antibody response includes molecules that react against a protein called NS1, which is encoded by the virus but does not form part of the viral particle (virion). ZIKV NS1-reactive IgG3 antibodies are only transiently present in serum, partly because they have a short half-life in vivo [7-8]. Therefore, the presence of these antibodies in serum has been suggested to be a signal of a recent ZIKV infection [7].

The authors estimate that 73% of the community was infected with ZIKV by October 2015. This proportion is similar to other estimates of ZIKV prevalence in Salvador [9]. Such a high level of anti-ZIKV immunity should protect this population from another epidemic ZIKV spread for many years.

To investigate whether prior exposure to DENV contributed to the risk of ZIKV infection in the community studied, the authors calculated the incidence of DENV infection using serum samples collected before the introduction of ZIKV in 2015. They used a logistic regression statistical approach to establish the probability of ZIKV infection as a function of the quantity of IgG antibodies that react against the NS1 protein of DENV, which they determined using 2 serological assays.

Curiously, 2 patterns were observed. The concentration of total DENV NS1-reactive IgG antibodies (irrespective of their subclass) was inversely correlated with the probability of ZIKV infection (Fig. 1). This observation suggests that DENV immunity has a protective effect against subsequent ZIKV infection. It also agrees with findings from a recent study of a population in Nicaragua [10] and might explain the low incidence of Zika that is observed in areas of southeast Asia, where DENV is endemic and highly prevalent.

Whether DENV NS1-reactive IgG3 antibodies have a direct role in the molecular mechanisms that increase the risk of ZIKV infection remains unknown. The NS1 protein is not part of the virus particle and also is not targeted by neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, NS1-reactive antibodies do not block virus infection directly, although they might contribute to limiting virus spread following infection. It is not clear whether DENV NS1-reactive IgG3 antibodies react against ZIKV.

The biological basis for the transient nature of the IgG3 response to flaviviruses is not fully understood. If IgG3 antibodies are indeed a marker of recent DENV exposure, it will be relevant to explore how changes in the repertoire or functional properties of cross-reactive antibodies in the months following DENV infection contribute to vulnerability to, or protection from, subsequent infection by ZIKV. Such studies might identify relationships between antibody binding sites on the virion and antibody function.

The analysis of well-characterized study populations in areas where these diseases are endemic, using innovative serological methods, holds great promise for identifying elements of the immune response and mechanisms of disease that will guide the development of countermeasures [3,5,10]. These same resources will be key for evaluating the impact of ZIKV immunity on subsequent DENV infections.
