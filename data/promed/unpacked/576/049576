LYME DISEASE - USA (MINNESOTA), 2007 INCREASE

The Department of Health said 2007 saw more than 1200 cases of Lyme
disease, the most common tick-related illness. Normally, the number
of Lyme disease cases is between 900 and 1000.

Epidemiologist Melissa Kemperman said there could be a number of
reasons behind the increase in the 3 diseases spread by the deer
tick. "Ticks expanding into new areas, which we have documented;
another reason could be people doing more activities in woody or
brushy areas, or there could be differences in doctors suspecting and
diagnosing the diseases," Kemperman said.

Lyme disease causes joint pain and inflammation and can damage the
heart and nervous system if left untreated. Kemperman reminds people
to use insect repellent when going out in the woods. It's also a good
idea to wear light-colored clothing to make the ticks more visible
and tuck pant legs into boots or socks when walking through brushy
areas.

[To quote CDC -- see URL below -- "With approximately 20 000 new cases
reported each year, Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne
disease in the United States. Cases occur most commonly in
northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central states and among persons
aged 5--14 years and 45--54 years. Cases peak during summer months,
reflecting transmission by nymphal vector ticks during May and June."

For a discussion of Lyme disease, please see prior ProMED-mail Lyme
disease posts listed below under 2007. Minnesota and Wisconsin are
among the 10 reference states in the U.S. where the disease is endemic
(Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin); 93
percent of the total cases reported to the U.S. CDC during 2003-2005
were reported from these 10 states and are the only states in this
group outside the Northeastern and South Atlantic regions of the USA.
