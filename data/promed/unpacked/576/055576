One more patient diagnosed with Congo virus [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever] was admitted in Quetta's Fatima Jinnah Hospital [Balochistan province] on Wednesday [7 Sep 2016]. With the recent diagnosis, the number of Congo patients admitted in the hospital in the ongoing year has reached 97, among which 27 have been confirmed of having the virus. The rest of the patients have been discharged after recovery, whereas blood samples of 2 people have been sent to Karachi for testing. The death toll from the deadly virus is 10 in the provincial capital. A day before, 25-year-old LM was shifted to hospital over bleeding from nose and mouth. He is a resident of Eastern bypass and works in a dairy farm. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) spreads through vectors that carry the virus found in cattle. The number of patients is rising as forthcoming Eid ul Azha has prompted people to buy sacrificial animals.

A 20- year old man died of Congo fever in Holy Family Hospital [Rawalpindi, Punjab province] on Thursday [8 Sep 2016], Geo News reported.

Dr Shafiq, Medical Superintendent at the hospital, confirmed the report and said that ZA was brought from Attock [Punjab province] 2 day ago with the fever.

Geo News correspondent said that 20 more patients were being tested for the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever or Congo virus that has killed scores of people in Pakistan this year.

Health experts are advising citizens to take special preventive measures to avoid contracting the virus ahead of Eid ul-Azha.

To reduce the risk, people are advised to wear protective clothing like long sleeves or long trousers and wear light coloured clothing to allow easy detection of ticks on the clothes.

According to them, healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Congo virus or handling specimens from them should implement standard infection control precautions. These include basic hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment, safe injection practices and safe burial practices.
