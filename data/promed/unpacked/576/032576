USDA battles rabies from above
------------------------------
Early in August [2002], woodland creatures may find fishmeal cakes
dropped into their midst that, once devoured, will deliver a rabies
vaccine.
Pilots contracted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture will fly over
portions of the East, including sections of Pennsylvania, in an aerial
effort to contain -- and eventually eliminate -- the rabies virus in the
raccoon population. The effort's official title is the National Oral Rabies
Vaccination Program.
"Eradication is not the right word," said Dennis Slate, USDA wildlife
rabies coordinator, "but (it is) elimination of the raccoon variant from
some areas where it has gotten a foothold... If you get enough animals
immunized, you can prevent the spread." What the USDA hopes to
accomplish is to halt the spread of raccoon rabies and, if successful,
put it out of the states where it was gaining ground.
Raccoon rabies began spreading through the East more than 20 years
ago, after raccoons were "imported" from Southern states to replenish
the Appalachian population.
Pennsylvania is following the lead of Ohio, where baiting appears to be
working. The placement of more than 3.3 million vaccine-laden
fishmeal cakes along the border has slowed the state's spread of
animals infected with raccoon rabies from 62 reported cases in 1997 to
zero last year, according to the Ohio Department of Health.
Raccoon rabies spreads quickly to other wildlife and pets, possibly
resulting in eventual human exposure. According to the Pennsylvania
Department of Agriculture, raccoons that eat the bait will develop
antibodies in 2 to 3 weeks, protecting them against exposure to another
infected raccoon.
Slate said raccoons are the primary rabies carrier in the eastern United
States. He said that the oral rabies vaccination program has been used
since the mid-1990s "on a much smaller scale." In 1998, it expanded
into Ohio, New York and Vermont, and the expansion continues
eastward. "What we are trying to do is prevent rabies from spreading
west," Slate said. Barring any intervention, he said, "once raccoon
rabies gets into an area, (it's) forever. Pittsburgh will be the first major
metropolitan area which will be approached as part of a rural bait
drop". He added that 18 million US dollars has been budgeted for the
aerial assault on rabies, with a "big chunk" designated for the
Pennsylvania project. The start date is 5 Aug 2002. Computerized on-
board systems allow shutdown of the bait release over homes and
roads, Slate said.
He said the drops are "very structured, very safe." As a plus, the
vaccines also work well on foxes and coyotes, among other wild
animals.
Project data will help determine future attacks on rabies; whether larger
land masses should be baited, or if working in small patches, a few at a
time, is more successful, he said, calling this summer's planned efforts
"pretty visionary." Slate said the state Department of Health, the Game
Commission, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
have assisted. "It's been a cooperative project," he said. "It couldn't
happen otherwise."
Some baiting was done last year in Crawford County, said Dr. John
Enck, the director of the state Department of Agriculture's Bureau of
Animal Health and Diagnostic Services who also serves as the state
veterinarian. "It's worked in Ohio for years," he said. The program's
success can be monitored by live trapping and blood tests to determine
if animals have been vaccinated.
Raccoon rabies, he said, "appears (to be occurring) throughout the
state." He said the state has averaged 400 cases of rabies in all animals
every year since 1990, with 438 cases in 2001. "This (raccoon) strain is
endemic in the eastern part of the United States," he said.
In other parts of the nation, including Texas, coyote and fox rabies are
being targeted.
Enck said 1.3 million bait cakes will be dropped in Pennsylvania. Other
East Coast drops include 13 000 in Kentucky, 600 000 in Ohio, 180 000
in Tennessee, 400 000 in Virginia, and 1.7 million in West Virginia.
A map, soon to be posted on the Department of Agriculture's Web site,
will show a "boomerang"-shaped line, he said, of the 25- to 30-mile
area along the borders of Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.
Locally, the bait is expected to be dropped (or hand-placed in more
populated zones) in the lower western portion of Westmoreland
County, most of Butler County, all of Beaver County, most of
Allegheny County, all of Washington and Greene counties and about
one-quarter of Fayette County.
The effort, he said, "will certainly give us a good idea to how well this
theory will work..."
Richard McGarvey, spokesman for the state Department of Health, said
the program's earlier success led to Pennsylvania's willingness to
become involved in the immunization program. "Usually more than 50
percent of reported rabies cases (in Pennsylvania) are raccoon rabies,"
he said. McGarvey warned that raccoons, like other wild animals,
should not be approached. "It's normally not (an animal) that comes
into back yards, or out where people are," he said. "They are
nocturnal." [But they do rob food from garbage cans -- see below. -
Mod.JW] Raccoons with rabies may be experiencing neurological
problems, he said. "When you see one in the afternoon, or daylight
hours, you have to assume it has rabies," McGarvey said. "They are not
going to come up to you and let you pet them."
He said residents could contact a local game or animal control officer if
they see wild animals in their yards, or rummaging through garbage. "If
you do get bitten by a rabid animal, or an animal you think is rabid,
certainly treatment is available," he said. He advised anyone bitten by a
wild or stray animal to wash the wound with soap and water and get to
a physician.
Although the last death from rabies in Pennsylvania was in 1984,
McGarvey reminded that the disease "is fatal." And if the animal cannot
be contained and tested (the animal must be euthanized and its brain
tested), the person bitten may have to err on the side of caution and get
the rabies vaccine, a series of 5 shots [which are nowhere near as
painful as the old 14-shot series. - Mod.JW]
"If you have dogs and cats," McGarvey said, "get them immunized. It's
the first line of defense." If pets are not vaccinated, and tangle with
wild animals, they could contract rabies and bring it back into the
home, he said.
McGarvey said the department will monitor the vaccine bait program to
see if it can effectively build a barrier against the advance of raccoon
rabies. "The success is going to start to show in the numbers," he said.
"We know we have rabies happening all the time; That's why we got on
board... (We want) to take that threat away."

[ In 2001, Pennsylvania reported 438 cases of animal rabies, according
to the Pennsylvania Animal Diagnostic Laboratory System. More than
half of the total of wild animal rabies cases appeared in raccoons, with
243 cases. - Mod.AS]
[This report brings back fond memories of gluing warning labels to
vaccine baits with weekend volunteers at the New York State Health
Dept. -- warnings for human finders to read. - Mod.JW]
