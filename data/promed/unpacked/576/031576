Thank you for your suggestion of having a global vaccine. Actually before
1998, there was only one influenza vaccine recommendation for the whole
world, made each February by WHO. This turned out to be inadequate in some
years, particularly for the southern hemisphere. In light of this WHO now
issues recommendations for both the northern and southern hemisphere, and
this was appreciated by the professionals involved around the world.
Both vaccines are obtainable in some countries (depending on the licensing
procedures of the government), and therefore travellers to the other
hemisphere should be able to obtain the appropriate one in many instances.
As influenza is a moving target, having one optimal vaccine for all is
presently not achievable.

As international travel continues to increase, there will be more and more
travel between the hemispheres during influenza seasons. Apparently some
consideration is now being given in the USA for a "traveler's vaccine",
which would probably be similar or identical to the Southern Hemisphere
formulation, and most useful for travelers leaving the USA for the Southern
Hemisphere between spring and fall.
That said, in the USA there are still issues of licensing, expiration, and
of labeling that would have to be sufficiently distinct to assure that
practitioners who administer vaccine give the right vaccines to the right
subjects.
Presumably other countries have similar concerns, but each country makes
influenza vaccine policy decisions based on its own assessment of the
particular situation.
