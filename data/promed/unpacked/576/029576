Anthrax behind Uganda Hippo deaths mystery
---------------------------------------
Nearly 200 hippopotamuses are dead after an anthrax outbreak in western
Uganda. Wildlife officials in the East African nation said Tuesday 194
Hippos had died In Queen Elizabeth National Park since July. The park's
chief warden John Bosco Nuwe said it took months of research and testing to
determine the cause of the deaths, which was finally identified as anthrax
by German scientists. "We are vaccinating the livestock around the park or
those in close proximity," said Nuwe.

An expert from the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in
Leipzig, Germany, has joined a task force to fight the epidemic.

Reports said 10 Ugandans also died after eating infected hippo. This could
not be confirmed, but the park director did say authorities were "telling
people not to panic, and stop eating hippo meat."

Queen Elizabeth National Park, on Uganda's border with Congo, is home to a
wide variety of African wildlife. About 5,000
hippos, one-half of the country's total, live there.

I was wondering if you were concerned by the anthrax outbreak among hippos
in the Queen Elizabeth National Game Park. Not so much by the outbreak,
but that the carcasses (approx 180) are all in the Kazinga channel (which
links Lakes Edward and George)? I would appreciate your thoughts on this!

[Spores in the water will obviously pose a risk, a significant risk, to
both humans and wildlife but dilution will occur with dispersal. But the
risk from animals dying in the water is probably minimal for anthrax
because of poor sporulation rates. The greater hazard here is plain water
pollution and the impact on dissolved oxygen levels --- fish need oxygen in
the water. If our Ugandan colleagues could comment on the ongoing public
health problems and actions in relation to this epidemic, it would be
appreciated. MHJ Mod]
