Abstract
-------
On [17 Feb 2022], the UK reported a cluster of cases with monophasic _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium sequence type 34 infection. As of [18 May 2022], 324 cases had been reported in 12 EU/EEA countries and the UK, including 2 distinct strains. Most cases are below 10 years of age and 41% of all cases have been hospitalized. The 2 strains are multidrug-resistant and some tested isolates also carry resistance to disinfectants that are based on quaternary ammonium compounds and hydrogen peroxide but remain susceptible to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and 3rd generation cephalosporins. Epidemiological investigations suggested specific chocolate products of Brand A, produced by Company A in Processing Plant B in Belgium, as likely vehicles of infection.

A total of 2 strains of monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium matching the outbreak strains were identified in the buttermilk line at Plant B between December [2021] and January [2022]. The buttermilk was provided by an Italian supplier where salmonella was not detected. The Italian supplier delivered the buttermilk to other plants of Company A where, based on the available evidence, salmonella was not detected.

On [8 Apr 2022], based on official controls, the food safety authority in Belgium decided to withdraw the authorization for production of Plant B due to lack of transparency and insufficient guarantees for safe production. Company A globally recalled all products of Brand A produced at Plant B. Public warnings were issued by the competent national authorities in different countries.

This outbreak has evolved rapidly, with children most at risk for severe infection. The closure of Plant B and the global recall of all their products have reduced the risk of exposure. However, 8 cases cannot be explained by consumption of chocolate products such as those manufactured at Plant B, suggesting that there may also be other sources of infection.
