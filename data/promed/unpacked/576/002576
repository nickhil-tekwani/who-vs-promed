Old Santa Fe Trail, Route 66 food products recalled
----------------------------------------------------
Beef jerky sold under the name "Old Santa Fe Trail" or "Route 66" is being
recalled after 19 of 21 people confirmed to have salmonellosis -- a
bacterial infection -- reported eating the jerky. That report was issued
Tue, 30 Sep 2003 by the Albuquerque municipal Environmental Health Department.
It says salmonella contamination was found in the jerky, and the
Albuquerque plant that makes the beef jerky has been closed. The jerky --
spiced with New Mexico chiles -- was marketed statewide in grocery stores,
convenience stores, the state fair, and by mail order.

2 previous New Mexico outbreaks of salmonellosis related to beef jerky are
found in the following MMWRs. (Carne seca translates as dried beef, i.e.,
beef jerky)
Outbreak of Salmonellosis associated with beef jerky -- New Mexico, 1995.
MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 1995;44:785-8.

Jerky, as it is commonly made in the USA, even in federally-inspected
commercial operations, is not inherently safe. In particular, the process
is vulnerable to survival of _Salmonella sp._ and _E. coli_ O157.
The problem is the mistaken belief that temperature alone is lethal to
bacteria. In fact, several types of bacteria, Salmonella in particular, are
able to shed moisture during slow drying and become very resistant to
subsequent high dry-heat temperatures. This is a dangerous problem when
the ambient air humidity is low, as in elevated locations. In 2002, New
Mexico alone had 8 documented outbreaks associated with jerky.
What is important is that _Salmonella_ must be killed rapidly before it has
a chance to shed moisture and become invulnerable to dry heat. In order for
this to happen, the wet-bulb temperature of the initial stages of the jerky
process must exceed 130 F for 2 hours, 140 F for 12 minutes, or 160 F for 8
seconds to pasteurize the meat free of vegetative cells. Unfortunately,
at high altitudes with dry humidity, the wet-bulb temperature is often
well below 120 F.
In fact, when investigating the cause of an outbreak of salmonellosis from
jerky at an operation at 5000 ft. altitude, I stood in an 180 F oven for
several minutes and waved to the director of technical services to convince
him the heat treatment was not lethal. The measured wet-bulb was 85 F, and
that's about how warm it felt. (This is why we can live in Phoenix, AZ,
during the summer months and survive!) In this particular instance, the
jerky was dried to a crumbly state (water activity < 0.3) with 180 F dry
heat, but 20 percent of the lots made still tested positive for Salmonella.
The only sure remedy is to cook the jerky with wet heat in the initial
stage long enough to pasteurize it. As stated above, this could be a
wet-bulb temperature of 130 F for 2 hr, which would not disturb most
processes. It does mean, however, a source of moisture must be present to
provide the water.
The reason that outbreaks from jerky occur mostly at high altitudes is due
to the dryness of the climate. At sea-level locations, the moisture of the
air is typically over 40 percent to start with and this, coupled with the
moisture from the meat, is enough to raise the wet-bulb temperature to
pasteurization levels. At high altitudes, or in dry climates, this is not
sufficient. With home desiccators, a pan of water can be put in the chamber
with the meat, but it would be safer to simply blanch the meat in boiling
water before starting.

[ProMED-mail thanks Drs. Hull and LaBudde for their pertinent comments
regarding the potential risks associated with dried meats.
The 1985 outbreak cited by Dr. Hull involved 29 individuals infected with a
single serotype, _S. cerro_, and mentioned an unpublished 1966 cluster of
41 persons due to _S. thompson_ that was associated with carne seca. Dr.
Hull was the state epidemiologist for New Mexico when the 1985 cluster was
reported. The 1995 episode involved 93 persons and 3 serotypes
(_typhimurium_, _montevideo_, and _kentucky_) with several individuals
being culture-positive for either 2 or 3 of the strains. - Mod.LL]
