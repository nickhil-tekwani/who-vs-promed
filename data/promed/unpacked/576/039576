Union International Food Co. is expanding a spice recall to include
all Lian How brand and Uncle Chen brand sauces, oil and oil blends in
various size packages because the products may be contaminated with
_Salmonella_. The company had previously recalled Lian How brand and
Uncle Chen brand dry spices.

California state health department officials say the salmonellosis
outbreak has sickened 33 people throughout northern and central
California, and 9 others in Nevada, Oregon and Washington. No deaths
have been reported.

Officials say most of the people sickened appeared to have been
exposed while eating at Asian restaurants that used the company's
spices. The company said salmonella was isolated from an open
container of Lian How white pepper.

[The products that are used in cooking are not likely to be vehicles
for transmission since the food is being cooked. Contaminated salt
and/or pepper used on the food after it is cooked (and cooler) are
more likely to be important in transmission. - Mod. LL]
