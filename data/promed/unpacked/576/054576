Peoria water warning: Don't even bathe in it
---------------------------------
Peoria has urged customers of Rose Valley Water Co. to stop using their tap
water for drinking, cooking, or bathing for fear it contains an organism
that caused the death of two 5-year-olds last month. A statement from the
Maricopa County Department of Public Health said testing of Rose Valley's
water supply gave an apparent positive result for _Naegleria fowleri_, a
parasite that causes primary amoebic meningitis. The state and the county
learned of tests taken by the Rose Valley water system Saturday that
yielded positive results for the organism that caused the death of the 2
children earlier this month, Public Health spokesman Doug Hauth said.
"We do not know how reliable these tests are," Hauth said. To stay on the
extreme side of caution, Hauth said the system was retested yesterday Rose
Valley owner Gary Brasher said preliminary testing detected a
micro-organism in the system, not necessarily _Naegleria fowleri_. "We were
the ones who called the county," Brasher said, telling them, "even though
we don't have our final results, we think you need to know this." About
2500 households in central Peoria and several county islands in west
Phoenix are served by the water company, which has been shut down by the
Maricopa County Environmental Services Department until it detoxifies its
reservoirs. In the meantime, water from the city's municipal supply will be
pumped to the homes. City officials estimate the switch will be completed
in 24 to 48 hours.

Authorities warn against using Rose Valley Water for drinking
----------------------------------
This is an advisory regarding recommendations to households served by water
from the Rose Valley Water Company. Rose Valley Water Company serves the
area bounded by Pinnacle Peak on the north, Beardsley Road on the south,
83rd Ave. on the east and 95th Ave. on the west. All within zip code 85382.
As a precaution, we recommend to residents to refrain from using Rose
Valley Water for drinking, cooking, or bathing. Avoid using or immersing in
any standing water like pools, hot tubs, jacuzzis, etc. Boil water or use
bottled water when cooking or drinking.
Don't let children immerse their head in any water. You can flush toilets,
do laundry or dishes. As a precaution, pets should not drink the water. If
you have a swimming pool, immediately super chlorinate the pool. The person
super-chlorinating the pool should be qualified in the service and
maintenance of swimming pools. Do not permit anyone to enter the swimming
pool until the above process has been completed and the water company or
Environmental Services Department have publicly announced that it is once
again safe to use swimming and bathing facilities. If you have a hot tub,
jacuzzi, or jacuzzi-style bathtub, immediately take these appliances out of
service until they have been cleaned, super-chlorinated, and refilled with
clean, chlorinated water, and the water company or Environmental Services
Department have publicly announced that it is once again safe to use
swimming and bathing facilities. We have received information that
additional tests by Rose Valley Water showed questionable findings for the
amoeba _Naegleria fowleri_. This amoeba caused the infection of two
5-year-old boys in Peoria who subsequently died. Because these tests were
carried out using methods still under research and not licensed for use in
this country, we are retesting the water system to verify results in
collaboration with the Arizona Department of Health Services and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Rose Valley Water Company
has been chlorinating its system since 18 Oct 2002. As a precaution,
Maricopa County requested the Rose Valley Water to connect all residents
currently using Rose Valley Water to the City of Peoria water system.
Increased chlorination is now provided at the junction of Peoria's system
with the Rose Valley Water system. The connection was made on 4 Nov 2002,
and the Rose Valley Water system has been flushed. When residents first
come online with this system, they can expect their water to come out
milky or brown. This is normal. The City of Peoria will provide
instructions on how and when you should flush the water in your house. As a
precaution, do not use the tap water until notified.
The incubation period or time between infection and symptoms for this
disease (amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by _Naegleria fowleri_) is 7-10
days. The symptoms include headache, nausea, and vomiting, stiff neck,
confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance
and bodily control, seizures, and hallucinations. If you experience these
symptoms, please contact your doctor or health care provider or the
emergency room. There are no tests to identify this disease before symptoms
develop. To avoid the infection, do not swim or jump into warm, stagnant,
fresh water, such as ponds or warm water discharge pools, or unchlorinated
swimming pools.
Do not swim in polluted water.Do not swim in areas posted as "No Swimming."
Hold your nose, or use nose plugs when jumping or diving into water.
New river water is not involved in this advisory Maricopa County Department
of Environmental Services notified all schools, restaurants, churches,
daycares, and other institutions in the area of this advisory.
For further health information, call 602-506-6900 between 8 a.m. and 5
p.m. Monday-Friday.

[Both postings emphasize that they have found an organism which may be
_Naegleria fowleri_ and the second message uses the word "questionable." It
is important to realize that potential harmful microorganisms are an
integrated part of our environment. More information on the testing methods
used to identify _Naegleria fowleri_ in the water supply would be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
