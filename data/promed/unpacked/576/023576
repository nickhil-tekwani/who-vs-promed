A man has died in Orenburg as a result of hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS). The chief physician of the city infectious
diseases hospital stated that about 70 patients with a similar
diagnosis are currently being treated in city hospitals. 5-7 new
patients are being admitted daily at the present time. An outbreak
in the region of this magnitude has not been observed for 4 years.
The reason for the extent of the outbreak appears to be a population
explosion in the field mouse population during a dry summer and
autumn, conditions favourable for breeding.

An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been
reported in the Orenburg region. In total 90 people are now receiving
treatment in hospitals. Since the beginning of 2005, 300 people have
been admitted to hospital with symptoms of HFRS, 2 of whom have died.
The symptoms have been high temperature, headache and fever. The
situation is exacerbated by the lack of an appropriate vaccine at the
present time. The death rate from HRPS world-wide is estimated to be
about 12 percent of symptomatic cases.

[According to another report
(<http://www.oren.ru/news/health/15717.html>) significant HFRS
morbidity in the Orenburg region appears to have stabilised. During
the first 6 months of 2005 only 35 cases of HFRS were registered,
which is 7.6 times fewer than in the first 6 months of 2003, when
there were 4 fatalities among 270 cases.

The Orenburg region is located in the foothills of the Southern Ural
mountains. It borders Kazakhstan in the south, the Samara region in
the west and northwest, and the Republic of Bashkortostan and the
Chelyabisnk region in the north. The total area is 124 000 sq. km.
The population is 2 150 000 inhabitants(2005 census). The capital
city of the region is Orenburg (latitude 51 deg 47 min 5 sec N;
longitude 55 deg 5 min 55 sec E). - ProMED Russian Correspondent]
