Residents of Grafton old camp in the Western Rural District of Freetown are calling on non-governmental organizations to come to their aid in the wake of the current cholera outbreak that has hit the locality.

Speaking to Concord Times in an exclusive interview, section chief of the camp, Ya-Alimamy Kamara, revealed that women and children are the most affected due to the unhygienic state of the camp as a result of children openly defecating within the environs of the camp. For this, she said they are calling on humanitarian organizations and other stakeholders to help them fight the outbreak.

"The camp currently lacks public toilet facilities, and the food being sold to people within the community is not well protected," she said, adding that plans are underway to sensitize inhabitants of the camp on sanitation issues.

A driver residing in the camp said the community has become overcrowded and that residents are not cleaning their dwelling places. According to him, the police have a role to play in maintaining sanity in the community.

Cholera has killed 8 people in southern Nigeria, and 10 others have been hospitalized, health officials said on Thursday [5 Sep 2013] in the latest outbreak to hit the country following a heavy rainy season.

Nigeria suffered cholera epidemics during the rainy seasons of 2010 and 2011, with nearly 2000 people killed over 2 years. While 2012 saw few reported infections, health officials warn that Nigeria remains vulnerable to further outbreaks because of its high population density and poor sanitation in many areas.

"We have 8 deaths and 10 people in the hospital," said Cosmas Oni, spokesman for the health ministry in southwestern Oyo state, adding that the outbreak was confirmed on Monday [2 Sep 2013].

"We have also embarked on a campaign to enlighten the people on the need to always clean their environment and drink clean water because the whole place is reeling with dirt," Oni told AFP.

Cholera outbreaks occur regularly during the rainy season in Nigeria, when downpours wash contaminants into wells used by families. The rainy season typically runs from April to September.
