Dog flu spreads to cats at NW Indiana shelter
---------------------------------------------
It's called the canine flu, but a group of cats at a northwest Indiana pet shelter now also have the virus. Veterinarians say it is rare, but the H3N2 virus can spread from dogs to cats. It now appears the virus can replicate and spread from cat to cat. So far, the virus has not been fatal in cats. It has been linked to some deaths in dogs.

An H3N2 vaccine is now available for dogs, but there is currently no flu vaccine for cats.

University of Wisconsin researchers said the strain of canine influenza that sickened a large number of dogs in the Midwest last year [2015] has now infected a group of cats in the region.

Sandra Newbury, a clinical assistant professor and director of the Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, tested multiple cats at an animal shelter in northwest Indiana, according to the release. The cats tested positive for the H3N2 canine influenza virus. "Suspicions of an outbreak in the cats were initially raised when a group of them displayed unusual signs of respiratory disease," Newbury said in the release. "While this 1st confirmed report of multiple cats testing positive for canine influenza in the U.S. shows the virus can affect cats, we hope that infections and illness in felines will continue to be quite rare."

[This seems to have been verified by testing but it is not necessarily comforting to feline owners. However, likely the same recommendations hold true. Keep your cat or cats isolated or as a closed colony. Isolate new animals. Keep infected dogs from having contact with cats in the household. - Mod.TG
