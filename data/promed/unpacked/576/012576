Stressing safety and trying to debunk a cloak-and-dagger image they said
was undeserved, officials of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center turned
to the public Wednesday night to seek support for an expansion that would
allow top-security research on viruses that are deadly to animals and humans.
But the reaction was mixed at the public meeting in Greenport, a community
on the North Fork of Long Island about 10 miles from the offshore center,
and where many of the center's 180 employees live. About 200 residents,
including lab employees, attended the meeting, the first of several to be
held in coming months, including one scheduled for Thursday night in
Waterford, Conn., about 10 miles north of Plum Island.
State Assemblywoman Patricia L. Acampora of Mattituck, whose district
includes the parts of Long Island nearest the 840-acre island, said: "No
one is questioning the need for us to be prepared to combat bioterrorism.
The central issue here is whether Plum Island is the appropriate location
to handle some of the most dangerous germs known to man." But David E.
Kapell, the mayor of Greenport, said a tour of the laboratory he and other
officials took on Monday had reassured him. "I can understand people's
fear, but on the other hand, Plum Island has been there 50 years and there
have been no incidents," he said.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is considering upgrading
the Plum Island center so it would be the only animal research center in
the country designated at biosafety level four, or BL4.
It is currently a BL3 center, where safety and security protocols are
similar to those needed at the higher classification.
The Clinton administration has expressed fears about a growing threat of
biological terrorism, which could introduce into animals viruses for which
there is no known cure; the viruses could then pass on to humans. But
members of a panel of high-ranking laboratory and agricultural department
officials at the hearing played down the threat of bioterrorism, saying the
BL4 lab would be used primarily to enhance the lab's mission of protecting
the country's $90 billion livestock industry against foreign viruses.
Those officials said there had been no final decision where to put the BL4
lab, but they left no question Plum Island was in the lead. The officials
said the island had advantages over other possible sites because it already
had a BL3 center and the scientific staff to study foreign animal diseases.
Dr. Kiley said an upgrading of the laboratory to BL4 would involve
extensive security measures.
The 5 towns on eastern Long Island have passed resolutions demanding the
Suffolk County Health Services Department be allowed to monitor lab health
and safety precautions. One of them, Shelter Island, has called on the
federal government to eliminate Plum Island as a potential site for the BL4
lab.
Thomas W. Sparkman, the First Selectman of Lisbon, Conn., said he was
unaware of any local groups opposed the BL4 facilities. Sparkman was among
the laboratory tour group on Monday. "Quite frankly, I was impressed," he
said. "I was given the sense they were ever mindful of safety."

PLUM ISLAND, N.Y. Contrary to rumor, there are no three-headed pigs here.
Still, this tiny, high-security island, only a mile and a half off Long
Island's prosperous North Fork, is the site of the Plum Island Animal
Disease Center, where scientists study some of the world's most infectious
animal viruses. It's the lab made famous in Nelson DeMille's 1997 best
seller "Plum Island," about stolen viruses and murdered scientists. And
because the public is usually kept out, there is wild speculation about
what goes on inside the lab 135 miles east of Manhattan.
Now that the Agriculture Department wants to upgrade the laboratory,
allowing scientists to also study animal diseases that endanger humans,
officials are going out of their way to ease public concern, addressing
local residents and taking elected officials and reporters on tours.
What's being considered is upgrading the lab to "Biosecurity Level 4", the
highest security level.
For the lab's current security level, reporters and photographers given a
tour last week. They had to completely remove their street clothing and
redress in coveralls and clean sneakers, standard procedure for Plum
Island employees. Photographers had to carry waterproof cameras that could
be soaked in acetic acid after the tour, again standard protective
procedures. Everyone had to shower for at least 3 minutes when they left.
Greenport Mayor Dave Kapell was one of the local elected officials who
toured the facility. "In every place that I went in that lab, I would see
people that I see every day in the village," he said. "These are all our
friends and our neighbors that operate this place."
"Frankly, if they're not scared, I don't feel scared."
