Two women died after contracting hemorrhagic fever in southern Russia, and
10 other people in the region have also come down with the illness, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported on Thursday. Health officials in Stavropol,
located about 1,200 km south of Moscow, said the outbreak occurred because
ticks which spread the fever had multiplied in unusually warm weather,
according to the report.
ITAR-Tass said that three people died of the fever [infection last year in
Stavropol, and that before that, there hadn't been a case of hemorrhagic
fever reported in Stavropol for 27 years.
The fever causes high temperatures, joint pains, chills and sometimes
bleeding. In extreme cases it can be fatal. [Epidemiologists are conducting
efforting against the ticks.
