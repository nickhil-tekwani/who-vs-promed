Equine piroplasmosis (EP), a disease thought to have been eradicated from
the United States, has resurfaced in North Carolina and 19 other states
over the past 2 years, Steve Troxler, state commissioner of agriculture,
said in a statement on Thursday [12 Aug 2010]. Blood tests identified EP in
11 horses in 4 locations across the state recently, Troxler said.

The NC Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is conducting an
investigation to determine the source of the disease and whether it has
spread beyond the locations where the infected animals were housed. Equine
piroplasmosis is a bloodborne parasitic disease primarily transmitted to
horses by ticks or contaminated needles. Mild cases of EP cause weakness
and lack of appetite. Signs can include rough coats, constipation, colic,
fever, anemia, and low platelet counts.

"By law, suspected cases must be reported to the state veterinarian's
office," Troxler said.

[Equine piroplasmosis results from infection by the protozoa _Babesia
caballi_ or _B. equi_ (phylum Apicomplexa). The 2 organisms may infect an
animal concurrently.

Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal infection of horses.
Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and
nonspecific clinical signs. The features of this disease range from acute
fever, loss of appetite, and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, chronic
weight loss and poor exercise tolerance, and indeed sudden death. The
disease may be fatal in up to 20 per cent of previously unexposed animals.
The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics of piroplasmosis
were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _B. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and
infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often nonspecific. In
rare peracute cases, animals may be found dead or dying. More often,
piroplasmosis presents as an acute infection, with a fever, inappetence,
malaise, labored breathing, congestion of the mucus membranes, and small,
dry feces. Anemia, jaundice, hemoglobinuria, sweating, petechial
hemorrhages on the conjunctiva, a swollen abdomen, and posterior weakness
or swaying may also be seen.

Subacute cases may have a fever (sometimes intermittent), inappetence,
malaise, weight loss, signs of mild colic, and mild edema of the distal
limbs. The mucus membranes can be pink, pale pink, or yellow, and may have
petechiae or ecchymoses. In chronic cases, common symptoms include mild
inappetence, poor exercise tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an
enlarged spleen (palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero
are usually weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and anemic. The
liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The spleen is enlarged,
and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial hemorrhages may be seen in
the kidneys, and subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart.
There may also be edema in the lungs and signs of pneumonia.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine
infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura hemorrhagica,
and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the organisms in
Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_ merozoites are joined at
their posterior ends, while _B. equi_ merozoites are often connected in a
tetrad or "Maltese cross". Organisms can often be found in acute
infections, but may be very difficult to find in carrier animals. In
carriers, thick blood films can sometimes be helpful.

Because babesia organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers, serology
is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests include
complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can distinguish between _B.
equi_ and _B. cabali_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and the
inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal with blood
from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free vector ticks can be
fed on a suspect animal, and babesia identified either in the tick or after
the tick has transmitted the infection to a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the spread
of tick-borne infections. However, preventing the transfer of blood from
one animal to another is vital. - Mod.TG
