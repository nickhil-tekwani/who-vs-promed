Even as the country is gripped by chikungunya, the head of the World Health
Organization (WHO) India said there are no deaths due to the viral
infection. "The study team which had visited Kerala to look into the
reported chikungunya deaths had not found a single death due to the
disease," Salim Habayeb, WHO's India representative informed Union health
minister Anbumani Ramadoss at a meeting of health ministers of 10
chikungunya-affected states here.
The study team, comprised of 3 WHO officials, and officials of National
Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) and National Institute of
Virology (NIV), visited Kerala last week to review the deaths [allegedly]
due to chikungunya. The team reviewed 58 deaths and found that none of them
had died of the viral disease, Habayeb said, adding, "the deaths were due
to co-infections and underlying causes." Ramadoss have been maintaining
since the chikungunya outbreak came up that there have been no deaths due
to the viral infection. Kerala government has been claiming that 86 people
have died due to the infection.

[Because mortality due to chikungunya virus infection has been highly
unusual or absent historically, ProMED-mail requested information (archive
No. 20060928.2774, referenced below) on laboratory results that confirmed
that these deaths were indeed due to the virus. This report indicates that
they were not due to chikungunya virus. Especially with a disease that
produces signs and symptoms that are not unique, laboratory confirmation is
critical in order to know which etiological agent is involved.
This will be especially critical should the chikungunya epidemic extend to
Delhi, where a dengue epidemic is occurring. Differentiation of the 2
diseases based on timely laboratory results will be important
epidemiologically. Both dengue and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by
the same vectors, _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae albopictus_, if this latter
species is present and abundant. Dengue infections can be fatal. This
report calls into question the previous reports of chikungunya fatalities
coming from the Indian Ocean outbreaks. Information about the basis on
which chikungunya virus infections were identified as the cause of death
would be appreciated. - Mod.TY]
