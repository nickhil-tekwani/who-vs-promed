The Chilean Health Ministry confirmed today 5 Jun 2015 a new case of measles, the 7th recorded in recent days in the capital. The new patient is a 32-year-old woman linked to the 38-year-old man reported in recent days as the 3rd case in the metropolitan area, said Radio Bio Bio.

The Chilean traveler was probably infected in China or during return travel. All cases except the 1st one have been identified with the viral genotype (H1), which is a variety that circulates in Asia, the source said. The Ministry recommended that people who travel abroad should get vaccinated against measles. Health authorities are concerned about these measles cases and the intense flow of people due to the 2015 Copa America.

According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), between 2003 and 2014, a total of 5077 measles cases were recorded.

The Martha's Vineyard Hospital has issued a measles alert following diagnosis of the highly contagious disease in an unvaccinated child visiting the island from another state. The child was evaluated at the hospital emergency room on Wed 17 Jun 2015.

"While the child was immediately identified and subsequently isolated from the community, we know that individuals on the island were exposed to the virus during a phase of the illness in which the patient is infectious but has no symptoms," the hospital said in the alert posted on its website.

The alert lists 5 known locations where exposures to others are likely to have occurred. They are:

- West Tisbury public library on 8 Jun 2015, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
- the Aquinnah Library on Tue 9 Jun 2015 from 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.
- and again on Thu 11 Jun 2015 from 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
- the Martha's Vineyard Airport Laundromat in West Tisbury on Fri 12 Jun 2015 from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
- Sharky's Cantina in Oak Bluffs on Tue 16 Jun 2015 from 7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and
- Ryan Family Amusements in Oak Bluffs on 16 Jun 2015, from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

Island public schools have sent alerts to parents. The alert, which came from Dr. Jeffrey Zack, chief of emergency medicine at the hospital, noted that other exposures are likely to have occurred. The patient was considered infectious from Mon 8 Jun through Wed 17 Jun 2015.

"There is certainly a lot of concern, folks wanting information," Dr. Zack said. "We would like to make sure the public understands that if they have questions they should contact their primary care doctor. The one thing we don't want is people coming into the hospital or into the doctor's office if they think they have measles. Letting someone into the building can make it an infectious area, at least for a couple of hours. It's most important not to spread this within the hospital.

Those under the age of 58 who have not been vaccinated, have not had measles in the past, or do not have blood work indicating immunity to the disease should attend the clinic, the Martha's Vineyard Boards of Health said in a press release. Hospital staff is working with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) to deliver proper and responsible communications out to the public and is following a protocol for public response to a measles diagnosis. The DPH said on Mon 22 Jun 2015 that this is the 2nd case of measles in the state so far this year [2015].

"We have staff members stationed outside the emergency room waiting area to inform and hopefully guide anybody who might be showing symptoms to the hospital. She said that doctors will screen people who are concerned about exposure over the phone then decide whether to refer patients to the emergency room. "The emergency room will be alerted, and you will be brought in through a decontamination entrance, and the staff will be properly dressed in precaution suits," Ms. Vanderhoop said. "It's a safer way to bring somebody who might have been exposed into the hospital."

Those that suspect a case of measles should not go straight to the doctor's office or the hospital, the hospital said. Instead, call your primary care physician, and follow the doctor's instructions. The doctor should be called if you develop high fever, a rash that begins on your head, or a runny nose and cough. The hospital also recommends calling a doctor if you or your child are not vaccinated, or unsure of immunization status.

Measles can cause serious problems such as ear infections, pneumonia and swelling of the brain in some people, especially pregnant women, infants, and those with weakened immune systems, according to the hospital. In rare cases, measles can lead to death. Adults are also at increased risk for severe disease and may need to be hospitalized due to complications. The island has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the state according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

Dr. Zack said the confirmed case demonstrates the vulnerability of an isolated community that sees a huge influx of summer visitors. "We live in a very small world," Dr. Zack said. "We're at risk, no matter where we live. We're about to hit high season, and we're getting people from all over the place. This is sort of an opportunity to reeducate everyone to the risks and benefits of vaccination," he said. "The problem is when you don't see a disease like measles for 50 years, people forget about the repercussions and why we started vaccinating in the 1st place. It killed thousands and thousands of people before vaccinations. We don't want to see those days, obviously, again."

[3] USA (Minnesota Airport Terminal)
Date: Fri 26 Jun 2016

On 22 Apr 2014 [note date], the Minnesota Department of Health notified CDC of a case of measles in a child aged 19 months who had documentation of receiving one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine at age 12 months. The child's illness was clinically compatible with measles, which was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M serology at the Minnesota Department of Health Public Health Laboratory. The child was febrile and developed a rash on 17 Apr 2015 while on an international flight from India to the United States before taking a connecting flight from Chicago to Minneapolis. Persons with measles are infectious from 4 days before to 4 days after rash onset. Therefore, travelers were exposed on both the international and domestic flights. CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine was contacted and provided information on potentially exposed persons to relevant health departments for follow-up. No documented transmission was reported as a result of the 2 flight exposures.

On 5 May 2015, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health contacted the Minnesota Department of Health to report a case of measles in a Minnesota resident aged 46 years with unknown vaccination status who was traveling in Massachusetts for business when a rash was observed. The case was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and immunoglobulin M serology at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory. This person had no known exposures or international travel, and did not fly on the same aircraft as the child from Minnesota on 17 Apr 2015. However, investigation revealed that both patients had traveled through a Chicago airport and used the same gate for their respective flights. Measles is a highly communicable disease, and infectious droplets can remain suspended in the air for up to 2 hours after an infected person leaves the area.

Although transmission could have occurred anywhere in the airport where the child and the adult shared airspace, it most likely occurred in the gate area during the 46-minute interval between the arrival of the adult's flight and the scheduled departure of the child's flight. The airline confirmed that domestic flights board 30-45 minutes before departure, and families with children typically board 1st. The child's family likely would have been preparing to board near the front of the gate area when the arriving adult exited his aircraft and passed through the area. Both cases were genotyped as D8 (endemic in India, where the child evidently acquired measles), and the corresponding nucleotide sequences were determined to be identical. The adult was admitted for isolation only at a Massachusetts hospital during the last 5 days of his infectious period. The child was admitted for 3 days at a Minnesota hospital. Both recovered fully without complications.

Measles transmission at international airports has been documented previously. Airport settings facilitate the mixing of persons from countries where measles is endemic around the world. The infectiousness of measles is evident when considering that transmission in this case occurred at a domestic terminal during a short period with brief contact.

Vaccinated persons can acquire measles for various reasons, including primary or secondary vaccine failure or improper vaccine storage, handling, or administration; however, measles transmission from a vaccinated person is rare. Although primary vaccine failure was not laboratory confirmed in this case, the child's highly elevated acute immunoglobulin M serology result and classic clinical presentation were consistent with immunologic naivete before infection. This incident also underscores the importance of CDC's recommendation for international travelers aged 12 months or older to receive 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine separated by at least 28 days, with the 1st dose administered at age 12 months or older (1).
