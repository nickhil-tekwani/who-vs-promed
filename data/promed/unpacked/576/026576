Unusual winter wheat disease
----------------------------
One specific problem that some wheat growers are seeing in our area [Coles
County, Illinois] is a fungal disease called _Cephalosporium_ stripe. This
is a fairly dramatic-looking disease when it shows up. The fungus is a true
vascular pathogen. Unlike many vascular diseases that produce toxins and
various compounds that gum up the vascular system of a plant and then cause
wilting, _Cephalosporium_ actually grows in the vascular tissue.

The leaf symptoms of _Cephalosporium_ stripe can occur from jointing to
heading. Growth of the fungus in the vascular tissue causes the dramatic
leaf symptoms because nutrients are unable to reach infected portions of
the leaf. The symptoms are generally one to 4 long yellow stripes per leaf.
The stripes are quite bright and often extend the full length of the leaf
and sometimes even continue down the leaf sheath and stem. As the leaf
ages, the yellow stripes eventually turn reddish brown, and gradually the
leaf withers and dies. Plants are typically stunted or dwarfed and produce
characteristic white, poorly filled heads with shriveled kernels.

Most typically, _Cephalosporium_ stripe is found first in low wet areas of
the field. Fluctuating winter temperatures, wet soil, and continuous
cropping of cereals and grasses favor its development. In highly infested
areas of the field, incidence can be as high as 80 per cent resulting
typically in a 50 per cent yield reduction.

Managing this disease and reducing the inoculum for disease development in
subsequent years can be accomplished by rotating to a non-host crop (corn
or legumes) for at least 2 years and by managing crop residue and grassy
weeds. When rotation with a non-host crop is not practical, removing or
plowing under residue to a depth of below 3 inches [7.5 cm] will help
decompose crop residue and manage the fungus. Although some differences in
susceptibility are noted, resistant varieties are not available.

[_Cephalosporium_ stripe is caused by _Hymenula cerealis_ (previously
_Cephalosporium gramineum_). The disease is known to affect wheat, barley,
oats, rye, and many other grass species, which can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Affected plants are usually randomly scattered through the
crop. Tillers have a single distinct bright yellow stripe on each leaf,
which extends onto the leaf sheath. All leaves on a tiller usually show
symptoms but not all tillers on a plant show symptoms. The vascular tissue
at the nodes is frequently discoloured. Tillers can ripen prematurely and
produce whiteheads with shrivelled seeds. The fungus enters host plants
through wounds such as root injuries due to, for example, frost or root
feeding insects. Heavy, wet soils and low pH favour the disease. The fungus
can survive on straw residue for 3 to 5 years and is the only true vascular
parasite known to attack wheat. Survival is enhanced by fungal production
of antibiotic substances. There are no chemical control methods for this
pathogen and disease management relies on cultural practices and use of
varieties with reduced susceptibility. The disease can be a problem during
repeated planting of certain high yielding but susceptible cultivars.
