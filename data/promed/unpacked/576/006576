----------------------------------------------------------------------
I was very interested to read of this case and see yet more
confirmation of the existence of melioidosis in Africa, although
because of this patient's extensive travel history it is obviously
impossible to pinpoint where the infection was acquired. Since the
review I wrote 20 years ago, which was cited in your report, there
have been very few further cases of human melioidosis apparently
acquired in mainland Africa or islands in the Indian Ocean.

Apart from the case from the Gambia reported on ProMED in 2009
[referenced below], 2 cases were reported from Madagascar (1) and an
additional case from Mauritius (2). A further case was reported last
year [2010] in "an African", but again it was impossible to determine
the precise source from the report and my attempts to contact the
authors to obtain further information have been unsuccessful (3).

Over the past year I personally have been contacted about a confirmed
case diagnosed in the UK in a patient who is likely to have acquired
infection in Nigeria, and single indigenous cases in Kenya and Malawi,
although both these isolates await full characterization.

I remain convinced that melioidosis is more common in sub-Saharan
Africa than we realise but is being missed, both because of a lack of
diagnostic laboratories and a lack of awareness. It would be
interesting to hear of further cases via ProMED-mail.
