University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, UCTH, has quarantined 10 persons following the death of a patient in the hospital on Wednesday [7 Oct 2015] with symptoms suspected to be [caused by] Ebola virus.

Dr. Queeneth Kalu, Chairman of Medical Advisory Committee of the hospital who made the revelation on Thursday [6 Oct 2015] in Calabar while addressing pressmen, said blood samples have been sent to the Ebola Diagnosing Centre in Benin Edo State.

"On Wednesday, 7 Oct 2015, we managed a patient who presented with symptoms mimicking viral hemorrhage (Ebola Virus) and have decided to take the necessary measures".

Dr. Kalu stated that those quarantined are principally nurses who attended to the patient and those who came in contact with him before his death.

"The following have been informed: National Centre for Disease Control, Federal Ministry of Health, The Cross River State Government, Calabar Municipality, and the Department of State Security Services, DSS."

She said further information will be provided to the public as soon as the test results of blood samples sent for analysis are received by the hospital.

[The most recently reported cases of Ebola virus infection in Nigeria occurred in 2014 and were related to the arrivial in the country of an individual who was infected during the outbreak in Liberia. Subsequently 8 people in Nigeria died out of 20 confirmed Ebola cases following introduction of the virus. In that situation:
- 899 contacts were traced (only 1 lost to follow-up)
- there were 20 cases, 8 deaths, CFR [case fatality rate] of 40 percent
- 1289 staff in Lagos and Port Harcourt EOC, including more than 300 in epi/surveillance, more than 500 in social mobilisation/communication, more than 300 at ports of entry, more than 100 in clinical care/case management, more than 20 lab staff, and more than 20 in the management/coordination team
- no health workers involved with case management were infected.

In the current case (report above), no mention is made of where or how the deceased patient may have acquired his infectiion. Nor is mention made of ruling out other hemorrhagic fevers that are endemic in Nigeria, chief among them Lassa fever, yellow fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever. Although not yet confirmed (or ruled out), implementation of quarantine and surveillance of contacts are prudent. This fatal case underscores the need for rapid laboratory testing, barrier nursing, and use of personal protective equipment when in contact with these cases. ProMED will be very interested in learning about the results of the laboratory tests when they become available.
