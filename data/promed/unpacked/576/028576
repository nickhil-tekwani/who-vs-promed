The 6th horse has died from eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], the
Marion County Health Department reported. The horse was in the
Williston area. Horses in Reddick and Dunnellon have also died of the
disease.

Because the sporadic nature of the mosquito-borne illnesses, there
are no plans to spray pesticides, said spokesman Johnny Thompson. "We
just want citizens to be aware of it so they can protect themselves,"
he said. "Anywhere in the county, we are susceptible to this."

There is no human vaccination for the disease and no cure if a human
contracts EEE.

[It is likely that Indiana is not spraying because, generally, the
colder weather will kill off the mosquitoes that carry the disease.

It is indeed sad that people do not vaccinate their horses. People
can get this disease from mosquitoes as well and should remember to
take precautions such as wearing long sleeves, avoiding being outside
from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are more active, and using
repellents with DEET. - Mod.TG]
