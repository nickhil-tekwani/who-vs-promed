Avian influenza: crisis over in the Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------
At the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 1
Jul 2003, the 3 Member States previously affected by avian influenza
gave an overview of their situation. Since there have been no new
outbreaks in the Netherlands for the whole month of June, the
protection measures for the Netherlands were not prolonged, as is
already the case for Belgium and the Land of North-Rhine Westphalia
in Germany.
This means that all restrictions will be lifted in the Netherlands as
of 11 Jul 2003 except in the surveillance zones around the outbreaks.
Restrictions in the surveillance zones may only be lifted once
"sentinel birds" have been placed in the affected holdings and
demonstrated that the virus is no longer present. [For the details of
this procedure see 20030628.1591. - Mod.AS]
Since the start of the avian influenza epidemic in the Netherlands on
28 Feb 2003, no exports from the Netherlands were allowed for live
poultry, hatching eggs, nor for fresh, unprocessed poultry manure and
litter. There were also restrictions on the transport of live poultry
and hatching eggs within the Netherlands, with some exceptions. Some
of these restrictions were eased on 13 Jun 2003, but restrictions
still remained in place for the 5 affected provinces: Flevoland,
Gelderland, Limburg, Noord-Brabant, and Utrecht.
The positive report by the Dutch authorities yesterday shows that the
crisis is now over and trade activities can resume as normal
throughout the country, except in the surveillance zones, as of 11
Jul 2003.
