[With the addition of the 7 newly reported cases and 3 deaths, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia is now 544 including 176 deaths. It may be too early to make this prediction/conclusion, but it does appear as though there is a decreasing number of newly reported cases on a daily basis over the past few days. In the daily report for both 20 May 2014 and 21 May 2014, there is mention of a death in an individual that was previously reported, but information on the original report could not be found (the 74 year old female in Jeddah whose death was reported on 20 May 2014, and the 72 year old female in Riyadh whose death was reported on 21 May 2014). Clarification on these cases would be greatly appreciated.

Questions that still remain are:

- What are the routes of transmission of this virus?
- Genetically, the virus is closely related to viruses identified in fruit bats, so the obvious question is how does/did it jump from bats to humans?
- More and more studies are identifying the same virus in camels as has been identified in human cases, so the obvious question is how did the virus jump from bats to humans and camels?
- Are the bats excreting and shedding virus in their roosting places and shedding virus on their partially eaten fruits?
- While it does appear as though camels may be involved in the chain of transmission, there are many people without a history of contact with camels who are infected, so how were they infected?
- The observation has been made repeatedly that the virus is not easily transmitted from person to person (based on the observation of limited spread among known contacts of MERS-CoV infected individuals), so if it isn't easy transmitted from person to person, what is the transmission in the health care environment to patients without a history of known contact with other MERS-CoV infected individuals, and to those within the community?
- There are many cases without a history of known contact with MERS-CoV infected individuals, so how are they getting their infections?
