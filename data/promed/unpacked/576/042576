South Korea has confirmed a fresh case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] at a hog farm, the agriculture ministry said in a statement on Thursday [04 Dec 2014], 5 months after an outbreak elsewhere that added to fears about food safety.

A ministry official said the farm was in Jincheon county, some 85 km (50 miles) southeast of the capital, Seoul, adding that the disease was unlikely to spread as it was one of 3 types that animals are inoculated against in South Korea.

He said there were 15 884 hogs at the affected farm and those that showed symptoms of the disease would be slaughtered.

The late July [2014] outbreak was the 1st in more than 3 years but it came as the authorities struggled to contain a continuing problem with bird flu, which has pushed up the price of pork as consumers bought alternative meat.

The livestock disease problems are a big factor behind a jump in pork imports, mainly from the United States and Germany. These rose 17.6 percent to 295 485 tonnes in the 1st 10 months of this year [2014] from the same period last year, South Korean customs data showed.

[Jincheon county is located in the province of Chungcheongbuk-do (North Chungcheong).

South Korea experienced a major FMD epizootic from November 2010 to April 2011, affecting both pigs and cattle. The causative agent was serotyped O, genotyped as topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. A total of 3748 farms were confirmed FMD-infected; 3 479 866 animals were culled. One of the main decisions undertaken by the authorities subsequent to the event was to implement a general vaccination policy, which has been maintained since 2011 and included vaccination of domestic ruminants and pigs.

Earlier this year [2014], South Korea suffered 3 outbreaks of FMD on pig farms in the east and south east, caused by FMDV-O, topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. 2 of the outbreaks occurred late July [2014] in the province Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang), and one on 6 Aug 2014 on a pig farm in the province Gyeongsangnam-do (South Gyeongsang). The event was addressed by modified stamping out (culling of clinically affected animals) and was declared resolved on 4 Sep 2014. The 2 relevant OIE reports, including an interactive map, are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15687.

Confirmation and results of the serotyping and genotyping of the virus involved in the current outbreak, and of the epidemiological investigation into the source of infection, are requested. - Mod.AS
