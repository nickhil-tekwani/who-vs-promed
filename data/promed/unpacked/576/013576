A ProMED-mail post

From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

In the past three years ProMED-mail has posted hundreds of messages
regarding infectious diseases. However, we are not always able to obtain
final information regarding a given epidemic, information such as total
number of cases, morbidity rate, total number of deaths, mortality rate,
date of last case, etc.
In order to bring closure to at least some of these epidemics, we would
appreciate it if knowledgeable and authoritative people reading this
message would send us such data. We are particularly (but not only)
interested in the following:
Rift Valley fever - Ethiopia 980222225015
Rift Valley fever - Kenya 980721210635
Rift Valley fever - Kenya & Somalia (04) 980413215115
Dengue - Trinidad & Tobago 971028162035
Acute febrile disease, horses - Iceland (05)980420212303
Anthrax - Australia (Victoria) (09) 970603120952
Rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease (14) 970928184847
These archives are most easily available on our website:
