Use of the microimmunofluorescence test (MIF) as indicator of past
infection with _C. pneumoniae_ or indicator of active infection.
The MIF is extremely difficult to perform. Standardization, e.g. by
reference sera, is not available. Kuo has shown the presence of _C.
pneumoniae_ in vascular tissue in the absence of antibodies. (Kuo CC, Shor
A, Campbell LA, Fukushi H, Patton DL, Grayston JT. Demonstration of _C.
pneumoniae_ in atherosclerotic lesions of coronary arteries. J Infect Dis
1993;167:841-849.) Thus, antibodies can not be used to determine the
presence or absence of _C. pneumoniae_. Elevated titers have been ascribed
to chronic infection with _C. pneumoniae_. However, Sinisalo did not find
any effect of antibiotic treatment on antibody titers. (Sinisalo J, Mattila
K, Nieminen MS, Valtonen V, Syrjaelae M, Sundberg S, Saikku P. The effect of
prolonged doxycycline therapy on _C. pneumoniae_ serological markers,
coronary heart disease risk factors and forearm basal nitric oxide
production. J Antimicrob Chemotherapy 1998;41:85-92.) Thus, antibodies are
not a good marker for activity of a _C. pneumoniae_ infection.

Koch's postulates
---------------------
The discussion on Koch's postulates is very interesting. I'd like to add
some issues to this discussion.
Postulate number 1.
The main problem is interpretation of the reported results. In most papers
the reactivity of a monoclonal antibody is reported. This type of result
should not be confused with a type of result indicating the presence of
the compete bacterium, like isolation. Cross-reactivity is difficult to
exclude. Newly formed epitopes inside the chronic inflammation areas should
also be considered. Thus, most authors assume they have found _C.
pneumoniae_, but only a few can really prove there findings. Thus,
postulate number 1 is not fulfilled.
Postulate number 2
The isolation is from whole tissues, including the contents of blood
vessels. Positive isolation could be a result of bacteremia.
Postulate number 3
Nearly all risk factors for cardiovascular disease show some effect in
appropriate animal models. Anyone can prove anything in animal models.
It might be a normal effect of any infection with chlamydiae not naturally
occurring in these animals.
Postulate number 4
Aorta cultures from mice after experimental infection are positive, with
the same comment as on postulate number 2.
Conclusion
No postulate has been fulfilled yet. A lot of work has to be done to
achieve fulfillment.
It is questionable if Koch's postulates are valid in today's research with
so many molecular methods. I recommend reading: Fredricks DN, Relman DA.
Sequence-Based Identification of Microbial Pathogens: a Reconsideration of
Koch's Postulates. Clin Microbiol Rev 1996;9:18-33.
