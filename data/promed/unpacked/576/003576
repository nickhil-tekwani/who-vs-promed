Abstract
--------
Angiostrongyliasis is a foodborne parasitic disease caused by the nematode _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ that can lead to eosinophilic meningitis (EM) or meningoencephalitis in humans.

_A. cantonensis_ is prevalent in the Pacific Islands. In recent years, a large number of outbreaks and severe cases have occurred. Several species of mollusk, such as snails and slugs, act as intermediate and paratenic hosts of _A. cantonensis_.

In this study, 2 cases of EM were found to have been caused by infection with _A. cantonensis_ due to consumption of raw centipedes. To survey the _A. cantonensis_ infections acquired through centipedes that the patients had bought at a vegetable market, we performed etiological examinations and polymerase chain reaction amplification of _A. cantonensis_ genes.

3rd-instar [developmental stage] larvae of _A. cantonensis_ were detected in the centipedes, and specific genes from _A. cantonensis_ were detected in all the specimens. This indicates that the centipede may act as a competent host for the transmission of _A. cantonensis_. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _A. cantonensis_ infection through the consumption of centipedes.

[Centipedes (from Latin prefix centi-, "hundred", and pes, pedis, "foot") are arthropods belonging to the class Chilopoda of the subphylum Myriapoda, an arthropod group which also includes millipedes and other multi-legged creatures. Centipedes are elongated metameric creatures with one pair of legs per body segment (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centipede).

The study found _Angiostrongylus_ in all centipedes sampled and analysed. The conclusion must be that centipedes should be thoroughly cooked before consumed by humans to avoid infection with _Angiostrongylus_. - Mod.EP
