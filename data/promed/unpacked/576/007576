Three cases of the highly contagious Rift Valley fever (RFV) have been
reported in Nairobi's Kariobangi and Eastleigh estates. Two people died
last week while a 3rd died early this week at the Kenyatta National
Hospital. But the government insists that the 3 contracted the disease
while in the North Eastern province.
Addressing a press conference on Wed [31 Jan 2007], Senior Deputy Director
of Medical Services Dr. Shahnaaz Sharif said meat in Nairobi, and other
areas that have no reported cases, is still safe to eat. He said: "We wish
to reassure Kenyans that it is safe to eat meat, but you must ensure that
the meat is cooked properly until there are no bloody parts. So far no
confirmed cases of RVF have been infected following eating of meat."
Dr. Sharif stressed that there is an ongoing public awareness campaign
targeting different audiences to inform Kenyans on the fever and steps that
should be taken to prevent infection in both animals and people. "You can
only get RVF by touching the blood or body fluids of an infected animal,
slaughtering, skinning and cutting meat of an infected animal, touching and
handling raw meat of an infected animal, drinking un-boiled milk from an
infected animal and the bite of an infected mosquito," he said.
[RFV] is [transmitted] by _Aedes_ mosquitoes and has spread in 14 districts
of the country namely; Garissa, Ijiara, Lamu, Thika, Maragua, Wajir, Tana
River, Kilifi, Malindi, Taita Taveta, Isiolo, Kirinyaga, Kajiado and
Nairobi. Out of the 414 suspected cases, 135 have been confirmed as Rift
Valley fever. It is however unclear what the precise death toll is. On
Monday the [death] toll was 121. Since then, however, 2 deaths were
reported in Kajiado yesterday bringing the toll to 123. However the
government says the toll is one less at 122 deaths.

Two more people have died of Rift Valley fever in Nairobi, sparking fears
that the virus could spread in the city. The 2 -- a man and a woman -- were
admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital from Nairobi's Kariobangi and
Eastleigh estates last week and died on Mon 29 Jan 2007, senior ministry of
Health official Patrick Nguku said yesterday.
Medics had established that the 2 had travelled to Garissa District, the
epicentre of the deadly disease. "They are likely to have contracted the
virus there," Dr Nguku said. This brings to 3 the number of people who have
died at Kenyatta hospital in the past 2 weeks. The 1st death occurred on
Sunday after a patient admitted 2 weeks ago from Kerugoya in Kirinyaga
District succumbed. This prompted the hospital to issue an alert to doctors
and nurses to be on the lookout for the killer disease.
At the same time, KNH director Jotham Micheni has announced that the
hospital has set up an isolation ward where patients manifesting symptoms
of the disease would be confined and treated. Dr Nguku said 2 more victims
of the fever were still at the hospital.
The officials were answering journalists' questions during a joint press
conference by Livestock and Health ministry officials at Afya House. Dr
Shanaaz Shariff, the senior deputy director of medical services, urged
Nairobi residents not to panic, saying the disease was unlikely to spread
in the city.
"A surveillance team comprising Livestock and Health ministry officials has
been set up in Nairobi to ensure that no infected animals from the
neighbouring Maragua, Kirinyaga and Thika districts are allowed into the
city. One can only be infected by handling blood or body fluids,
slaughtering, skinning, cutting or drinking unboiled milk from an infected
animal or from the bite of an infected mosquito," he said.
He appealed to Nairobi residents not to stop eating roasted or boiled meat.
"However, people should ensure they only eat meat that has been
rubber-stamped and inspected by veterinary officials," Dr Shariff added.
Since the outbreak 2 months ago, the death toll has reached 122.

Kenya's capital Nairobi is among the 9 high-risk districts where a million
doses of Rift Valley fever (RVF) vaccine will be distributed. Kenya's
Livestock and Fisheries Development Minister Joseph Munyao said Tue 30 Jan
2007 that the vaccine would also be distributed in Nakuru, Koibatek, Uasin
Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Trans Mara, Narok,
Kajiado, Machakos and Nyeri districts,
Meanwhile, Rift Valley Fever has killed up to 124 people. "On average, each
district will receive 100 000 doses, which will be distributed according to
livestock population and RVF risk. "At the same time, the ongoing control
activities in North Eastern and Coast provinces will be stepped up," Munyao
said.
When the Rift Valley fever broke out 2 months ago, more than 400 000 head
of livestock, out of the targeted 2 million, had been vaccinated in various
parts [of the country]. On Tuesday, the lives stock minister distributed 10
000 litres of synthetic insecticide which would be distributed at no cost
to farmers and herders to assist in fighting mosquitoes.
In the same light, the United States (U.S) Government announced it would
donate a 2nd shipment of 800 000 doses of livestock vaccine worth Sh 21
million [USD 299 000]. "This contribution follows the initial one where 450
000 doses, worth Sh 12.5 million [USD 178 000], were donated on 7 Jan
2007," a statement added. The Kenyan Government last week released Sh 100
million [USD 1.4 million] to assist in the fight against Rift Valley fever.
Rift Valley fever which was first identified in the Rift Valley Province in
the 1930s is a viral disease which primarily affects animals, but
occasionally attacks humans.

Rift Valley Fever Outbreak -- Kenya: Nov 2006 to Jan 2007
--------------------------------------------------------
In mid-December 2006, several unexplained fatalities associated with fever
and generalized bleeding were reported to the Kenya Ministry of Health
(KMOH) from Garissa District in North Eastern Province (NEP). By 20 Dec
2006, a total of 11 deaths had been reported. Of serum samples collected
from the first 19 patients, Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus RNA or
immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against RVF virus were found in samples
from 10 patients; all serum specimens were negative for yellow fever,
Ebola, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and dengue viruses. The outbreak
was confirmed by isolation of RVF virus from 6 of the specimens. Humans can
be infected with RVF virus from bites of mosquitoes or other arthropod
vectors that have fed on animals infected with RVF virus, or through
contact with viremic animals, particularly livestock. Reports of livestock
deaths and unexplained animal abortions in NEP provided further evidence of
an RVF outbreak.
On 20 Dec 2006, an investigation was launched by KMOH, the Kenya Field
Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (FELTP), the Kenya Medical
Research Institute (KEMRI), the Walter Reed Project of the U.S. Army
Medical Research Unit, CDC-Kenya's Global Disease Detection Center, and
other partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins
Sans Frontieres (MSF). This report describes the findings from that initial
investigation and the control measures taken in response to the RVF
outbreak, which spread to multiple additional provinces and districts,
resulting in 404 cases with 118 deaths as of Thu 25 Jan 2007.
Teams of investigators conducted patient interviews and reviewed medical
records from 1 Dec 2006 forward in major health-care facilities in the
districts from which cases were first reported. The teams detected
additional cases by meeting with elders, other leaders, and health-care
providers in villages where cases had been reported and in adjacent
villages. Blood samples from patients with suspected RVF were collected and
maintained at 39.2 F (4.0 C). Samples from NEP and surrounding areas were
transported to a field laboratory established at Garissa Provincial
Hospital by CDC, KEMRI, and KMOH; samples from other areas were sent to
KEMRI laboratories in Nairobi and to a laboratory in Malindi that was
supported by a team from Health Canada.
A suspected case was defined as acute onset of fever (>99.5F [>37.5C]) with
headache or muscle and joint pain since 1 Dec 2006 in a person who had no
other known cause of acute febrile illness (e.g., malaria). A probable case
was defined as acute onset of fever in a person with unexplained bleeding
(i.e., in stool, vomit, or sputum or from gums, nose, vagina, skin, or
eyes), vision deterioration, or altered consciousness. A confirmed case was
defined as a suspected or probable case with laboratory confirmation of the
presence in serum of anti-RVF virus IgM by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) or RVF virus RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR).
The index case was reported in Garissa District in a patient who had
symptom onset on 30 Nov 2006. Retrospective analysis of sera collected
during July to November 2006 at Garissa Provincial Hospital revealed no
evidence of earlier acute RVF infections. As of 25 Jan 2007, a total of 404
cases of RVF had been reported in Kenya with 118 deaths, a case-fatality
rate of 29 percent. Of the reported cases, 115 (29 percent) were laboratory
confirmed by anti-RVF virus IgM by ELISA (64 cases, 56 percent) or RT-PCR
(79, 69 percent), including 28 cases (24 percent) confirmed by both. Of the
remaining 289 cases, 109 were classified as probable.
Of the 230 patients with available demographic information, 140 (61
percent) were male [illustrated by a histogram in the original text].
Patients ranged in age from 4 to 85 years, with a median age of 27 years
(30 years for females and 25 years for males). RVF cases were reported from
3 districts in NEP (Garissa [175 cases], Ijara [125], and Wajir [26]); 5
districts in Coast Province (Kilifi [38], Tana River [16], Malindi [8],
Isiolo [8], and Taita Taveta [one]); 2 districts in Central Province
(Kirinyanga [2] and Maragua [one]); one district in Rift Valley Province
(Kajiado [3]); and one from Nairobi Area [These districts are located in a
map in the original text]. The patient from Nairobi had traveled to NEP
during the week before illness onset but was hospitalized in Nairobi. Ijara
(population 79 932) and Garissa (population 420 918) districts had the
highest RVF incidence rates: 156 and 42 per 100 000 population, respectively.
Among the first 97 reported cases from Garissa and Wajir districts with
detailed epidemiologic information available, 71 (73 percent) met the
probable case definition; 38 of the 62 patients who provided blood samples
tested positive by IgM ELISA, RT-PCR, or both. The most frequently reported
symptoms among the 97 patients were fever (100 percent), headache (90
percent), bleeding (76 percent), malaise (70 percent), muscle pain (62
percent), back pain (60 percent), vomiting (56 percent), and joint pain (51
percent).
Two thirds of the 66 patients who provided information on potential risk
factors reported having an animal that was recently ill. The most
frequently reported RVF risk factors during the 2 weeks preceding illness
onset were drinking unboiled (raw) milk (72 percent); living within 100
meters of a swamp (70 percent); having an ill animal (67 percent); drinking
milk from an ill animal (59 percent); working as a herdsman (50 percent);
having a dead animal (50 percent); and slaughtering an animal (42 percent).
Approximately 9 percent of patients reported contact with another ill human.
The outbreak peaked on 24 Dec 2006, and the number of daily cases has been
declining since 27 Dec 2006 [illustrated by a figure in the original text].
A ban on livestock slaughtering in Garissa District went into effect on 27
Dec 2006 and was expanded as RVF was detected in additional districts.
Vaccination of animals with live, attenuated RVF vaccine began on 8 Jan
2007. Prevention messages were developed in 3 languages (English, Kiswhali,
and Somali), and public meetings (known as barazas) were held to spread
information rapidly to the community. Messages also were disseminated via
radio, a widely used communication medium in NEP. Village elders, chiefs,
and religious leaders were consulted throughout Garissa District, leading
to a district ban on the slaughter of livestock and closure of the
livestock market. Health-care workers were trained to care for persons
suspected to be infected with RVF virus.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
RVF is an acute, febrile zoonotic disease caused by Rift Valley fever
virus, which belongs to the family _Bunyaviridae_ and genus _Phlebovirus_.
The virus is primarily a vector-borne zoonotic pathogen. Humans acquire RVF
through bites from infected mosquitoes or, more frequently, through
exposure to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of animals that have been
bitten by infected mosquitoes.
Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through
veterinary and obstetric procedures. RVF was first described in sheep in
the early 20th century, and the virus was first isolated in humans in Kenya
in 1930 (1,2). In livestock, RVF causes abortion and death. Livestock
epizootics can occur after heavy rainfall and flooding that result in
hatching of _Aedes_ mosquitoes (thought to be the initial vector and
inter-epizootic reservoir of RVF) and other vectors that feed on nearby
mammals (3). Eastern Kenya experienced unusually heavy rainfall during the
period October to December 2006, three times the average for that period
during the preceding 8 years and 13 times the rainfall in 2005 (Kenya
Meteorological Department, unpublished data, 2007).
Patients with RVF usually have initial signs and symptoms of influenza-like
illness; less than 8 percent of patients subsequently have severe disease,
including generalized hemorrhagic syndrome, encephalitis, or retinitis (2).
The overall human mortality rate from RVF has been estimated at 0.5 percent
to 1.0 percent of those infected, but the rate is much higher among those
with severe disease. The largest reported human outbreak occurred in Kenya
during the period 1997 to 1998, in which an estimated 89 000 persons (based
on a systematic serosurvey) were infected and 478 died; this outbreak also
was centered in NEP (3, 4, 5). Previous RVF outbreaks among humans were not
reported outside sub-Saharan Africa until 1977 to 1978, when approximately
18 000 persons became ill with 1000 in Yemen had severe illness (6, 7, 8).
Like the 1997-1998 outbreak, the current outbreak was associated with heavy
rainfall, which produced massive flooding in much of Kenya, and
particularly in NEP. Climatic forecasting in conjunction with satellite
imaging of flooded areas has been suggested as a method for predicting
where and when RVF outbreaks might occur, potentially enabling earlier
interventions (9).
Most of the cases before 20 Dec 2006 occurred in young men who herded
livestock, perhaps because herdsmen are the first to identify and slaughter
ill animals. Later in the outbreak, the distribution of cases broadened by
age and sex. Young women also were over-represented, perhaps because they
handle uncooked animal products at home as they prepare meals for the
family. Cases among children aged <5 years and the elderly have been rare,
probably because they rarely interact with animals or handle raw animal
products.
Most patients reported to KMOH had severe illness with bleeding, which
likely accounts for the 29 percent case-fatality rate. Judging from
previous studies, many mild, undetected RVF virus infections likely
occurred during this outbreak (5). Additional cases of severe disease also
might have occurred in NEP but were not detected because of the
inaccessibility of many areas of the province resulting from flooding. Many
areas of NEP, including an entire division of Garissa District, were
unreachable by road from early December to mid-January.
Since mid-January, RVF in livestock has been detected in districts
surrounding Nairobi, signaling occurrence of the outbreak in new areas.
Reports also have been received of livestock and humans with illness
consistent with RVF across the border in Somalia, where disease assessment
has been hampered by ongoing security concerns. Several international
organizations are collaborating to control the spread of the outbreak
within Kenya and to other countries. Travelers should take precautions when
visiting RVF-affected areas.
Generally, the risk for RVF infection among travelers to Kenya is low,
unless they visit areas where an outbreak is occurring and are bitten by
infected mosquitoes or come in contact with body fluids, uncooked tissue,
or aerosols from infected livestock. No preventive RVF medications or
licensed vaccines for humans exist. Travelers to affected areas should
reduce their risk for infection by protecting themselves from mosquito
bites and by avoiding direct contact with livestock. Specific
recommendations for U.S. travelers are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/2006/rift_valley_fever_kenya.htm>.
To control the outbreak, KMOH launched several interventions, some of which
might have limited the public health impact of the outbreak. A ban on the
slaughter of animals (including during Eid-ul-azha, a religious holiday)
was imposed in NEP and strictly enforced. The Ministry of Livestock and
Fisheries Development initiated a policy of vaccinating apparently
unaffected herds of livestock in districts in which human or livestock RVF
disease had been confirmed and also in adjacent districts; however, as of
25 Jan 2007, only a small proportion of livestock had been immunized. Other
interventions included heightened disease surveillance among humans and
animals, community mobilization, animal quarantines and restricted
transport of livestock, and an integrated vector-control strategy,
including indoor residual spraying and larviciding. RVF wards were
established in which appropriate infection-control measures were encouraged.
Timely detection of this outbreak was aided by implementation of Integrated
Disease Surveillance and Response [A strategy of the African Regional
Office of WHO that aims to improve availability and use of surveillance and
laboratory data to control infectious diseases that are the leading causes
of death, disability, and illness in the region] within most of the
affected districts. A 2nd factor contributing to timely detection was
initiation of RVF laboratory-supported field surveillance of febrile
patients at outpatient clinics in Garissa. Ongoing epidemiologic,
entomologic, and veterinary studies related to this outbreak continue to 1)
identify factors associated with severe forms of RVF illness and poor
outcomes; 2) characterize the role of specific species of mosquitoes in
transmitting, maintaining, and spreading RVF virus; 3) assess the economic
impact of the outbreak; and 4) define the impact of livestock immunization
with live, attenuated RVF veterinary vaccine on minimizing the spread of
animal and human disease. Taking measures to decrease contact with
mosquitoes through use of repellents and bednets and avoiding exposure to
blood or tissues of animals that might be infected are important protective
measures for preventing RVF.
Livestock vaccination also can be an effective means of preventing cases of
human RVF if adequate vaccination coverage and herd immunity are achieved.
