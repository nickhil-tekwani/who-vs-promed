About 100 cows died, and over 100 have been affected with foot and
mouth disease [FMD] in a week in Dimla upazila under Nilphamari, as
the disease is spreading at an alarming rate in the upazila.

Dimla upazila livestock office sources yesterday [22 Aug 2009] said
that more than 100 cows died of FMD disease within the last week.

The disease, which is locally known as "khura rog," is a contagious
viral disease which has no remedy. But it can be prevented if the
cows are vaccinated in time. If a cow is attacked with it, it is
destined to die [see comment].

The disease has taken a serious turn in Purbo Chhatnai, Paschim
Chhatnai, Balapara, Jhunagachh Chapani and Khalisha Chamani unions of
the upazila, farmers said. The disease has taken a serious turn, as
the living and grazing places of the cows have been affected in the
ongoing rainy season.

Hundreds of cow rearing farmers are crowding at the upazila livestock
office everyday only to be disappointed, as there is no modern
treatment facility.

The post of upazila livestock officer (ULO) has been vacant for a
long time. In his absence, other employees of the office said that
they have nothing to do, as there is no medicine for treatment. The
cows should have been vaccinated in time, they said. The disease can
be prevented, but there is no cure.

Upazila veterinary surgeon Dr. Abdus Sobhan, also working as acting
ULO, admitted the spread of FMD in the upazila. He said that he has
asked the farmers to adopt an indigenous method to treat the
FMD-affected cows. He suggests that the farmers should coat the
affected tongue and mouth of the cows with Sohaga, a kind of chemical
substance along with honey, and wash the cow's hooves with potassium
[permanganate].

The acting ULO told newsmen that they have a requirement for 5000
dozes of vaccine every month but that they received only 3700 dozes
of vaccine in last fiscal year, which was distributed long ago.

[If this is indeed FMD, if the given mortality figures are right, and
if they refer to adult cattle, they should be regarded as
exceptionally high. Generally, mortality in adult animals does not
exceed 5 percent. In offspring, mortality rates of 50 percent or even
higher may occur.

This event, the description of which lacks information on the disease
signs and the affected animal population, in particular age, deserves
to be investigated. Clinical, pathological and laboratory
examinations will confirm or discount the suspected FMD. Other
disease and mortality causes, infectious and non-infectious, should
be excluded.

FMD is endemic in Bangladesh. According to the data of the World
Reference Laboratory for FMD (Pirbright), the serotypes reported last
were Asia 1, O and A.
