The Department of Health (DOH) on [Tue 5 Nov 2019] evening confirmed the 4th polio case in the country. "The test conducted by our Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases- Japan confirms the 4th polio case in the country," Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement.

The health department, meanwhile, did not provide further details about the new polio case.

To recall, the DOH confirmed the 3rd polio case last [28 Oct 2019], involving a 4-year old girl from Datu Piang, Maguindanao province. A total of 2 confirmed cases of polio, meanwhile, were declared last September [2019] that involved a 3-year-old girl from Lanao Del Sur and a 5-year-old boy from Laguna.

Duque called on the public to "trust and actively participate" in the government's immunization program. "Polio is best prevented through vaccination. The virus is transmitted through oral-fecal route. Hand washing will also help in the prevention," said the health chief.

To note, Duque reported that they reached their target-96% coverage- for the synchronized polio vaccination campaign conducted in Metro Manila and some parts of Mindanao last [14 to 27 Oct 2019].

The polio vaccination campaign is set to be expanded to the whole of Mindanao on [25 Nov 2019] for the 2nd round of the campaign, and will be concluded with the last round of vaccination on [6 Jan 2020]. Meanwhile, the last round of vaccination in Metro Manila is scheduled on [25 Nov 2019].

[One presumes the virus involved in this 4th case is a cVDPV2 (circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2), as the other cases in the south of the Philippines were cVDPV2 associated. That being said, prudence says more information from knowledgeable sources would be very helpful. Additional information that will be helpful includes age and gender of the case, date of onset and vaccination history.
