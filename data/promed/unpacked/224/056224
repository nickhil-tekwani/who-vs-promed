Anthrax outbreak leaves two dead in Zimbabwe
-----------------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak in Zimbabwe recently killed 2 people and left 20 others
infected at a new resettlement area and 2 villages in the northeast of the
country, said a provincial medical official on Monday. Medical director for
Mashonaland Central, Biggie Mabaera, said that the 2 died at Harare
Hospital last week after eating meat from a cow suspected to have been
infected with anthrax. However, he said the situation was under control in
the areas where the outbreak was reported. "The veterinary services were
deployed soon after the outbreak and were quick to control the situation
and to date there are no other cases," Mabaera said.
So far, only 20 [cutaneous?] cases were reported, and the situation has
been arrested after hard work by the veterinary team. "They have succeeded
in vaccinating all the [residents of] affected areas and the situation is
back to normal," he said.
The 2 victims were from Glamorgan Farm, while those infected [cutaneously?]
were from Vale Farm, Chileka, and Mazarura Villages. The deceased were
buried at their homes, while those infected were treated and discharged at
Rutope Clinic in Bindura.
Mabaera urged villagers not to eat meat from animals that died on their own
or slaughtered after some illness. "People should be cautious about such
kind of meat, as they may risk their lives as a result of eating infected
meat," he said. It is suspected that the owner of a farm in Bindura
slaughtered a cow and villagers bought the infected meat. They complained
after eating the meat and the owner at one time suspected the meat to have
been poisoned. He called officials from the Veterinary Department to
inspect the meat and they found that it was infected with anthrax.

[I am presuming that the "infected" were just cutaneous cases, as they were
not hospitalised. This is a tragic example of the reverse African ratio of
few livestock cases (1) to many human cases (20). If there were other
livestock deaths they were not mentioned. - Mod.MHJ]
