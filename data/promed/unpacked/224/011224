Scrub typhus is a common cause of acute febrile illness without many
organ-specific signs in Southeast Asia. The eschar is usually missed
and often in the groin, as the mite bites when the patient defecates
or urinates outdoors. It can result in interstitial pneumonitis and
even CNS involvement and fatality. Where specific laboratory tests
are not immediately available (which is in most of the region), a
therapeutic trial of doxycycline is the best approach. The response
is often dramatic!

[Dr. Wilde's comment is appreciated. As with other suspected
rickettsial illnesses, empiric therapy is frequently warranted, given
the potentially serious outcomes and the difficulty of making an
early definitive diagnosis. - Mod.LM]
