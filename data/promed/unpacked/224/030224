Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in Algeria - 31 May 2014
--------------------------------
The Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform of Algeria notified the World Health Organization of 2 cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) on [31 May 2014].

The 2 patients stayed in Saudi Arabia for the performance of Umrah. The date of onset of illness for both patients is 23 May 2013. The diagnosis and confirmation of the new coronavirus infection was established for both cases on [30 May 2014] by the National Reference Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute of Algeria.

The 1st case, a 66-year-old man, presented with fever and dyspnoea on 23 May 2014 upon arrival from Mecca the same day. He was admitted to the Kolea Hospital EPH. The 2nd case, a 59-year-old man, also presented with influenza like illness (ILI) and diarrhoea on [23 May 2014] in Saudi Arabia. He was hospitalized on [29 May 2014] and is being treated at the University Hospital (CHU) of Tlemcen hospital of Algeria.

This is the 1st laboratory confirmed human case of MERS-CoV in the WHO African region. The early detection and confirmation of these 2 cases is a result of intense preparedness activities implemented over the past months by the Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform of Algeria in close collaboration with WHO and partners.

The following measures are being taken by national authorities: enhancement of surveillance particularly at points of entry; strengthening of infection prevention and control; case management; and sensitization of the population and health care workers on preventive and control measures that should be taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. A meeting of the national epidemic management committee is planned for early next week to review the situation, carry-out a detailed risk assessment and provide additional recommendations on preventive and control measures that should be taken at all levels.

Based on the current information available for this event, WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied to the Republic of Algeria.

Jordan confirms on Sunday [1 Jun 2014] a new death from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection, which puts the death toll to 6 in the country since MERS has been spreading throughout the region, according the Health Ministry.

The ministry said it reported a new case of MERS. The infected person is a nurse who works at a private hospital. Eleven MERS cases have been detected in Jordan since 2012, of whom 6 have died.

The MERS outbreak has caused a panic throughout the region, prompting many governments to launch awareness campaigns and precautionary measures in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.

[With the 2 newly confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia and 2 deaths of previously confirmed cases, the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia is now 571 including 189 deaths.

While it appears as though MERS-CoV infections are decreasing in Saudi Arabia, it also appears as though the number of imported cases of MERS-CoV infection outside of the Arabian Peninsula is increasing. In the above report, there is information on 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection in individuals returning from Saudi Arabia where they had performed the Umrah pilgimage. No information on possible high risk exposures while in Saudi Arabia is available to permit an assessment of the transmission. In the past month, there have been importations into the USA (2 cases), the Netherlands (2 cases), Lebanon (1 case), and Jordan (1 case). In the latter instance (Jordan), there has been evidence of nosocomial transmission following the importation of a case with resultant 5 additional cases including 3 deaths. Of note, 4 of the 5 cases were in health care workers (including the newly reported fatal case in the above media report in section [4]).

More information on the 2 newly confirmed cases in Algeria would be greatly appreciated.

A map showing the locations of the cases and deaths reported over the past 2 days in Saudi Arabia can be found at the source URL.
