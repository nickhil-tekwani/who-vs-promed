At least 140 people in Sudan have died from meningitis and 1,000 more are
suffering from the [bacterial infection that affects the brain, a health
official said Tuesday. The Al-Rai Al-Akhar newspaper quoted Bashir Mukhtar
of the Health Ministry as saying that better coordination is needed between
government officials and aid agencies to contain the outbreak. The
Sudanese News Agency reported Tuesday that the disease first surfaced last
month in West Darfur state, where 24 deaths were reported. It said 19
deaths were later reported in South Darfur state, 600 miles west of the
capital, Khartoum. But even as doctors began to control the epidemic, it
spread to central Sudan and Khartoum, SUNA reported.
Meningitis, an acute inflammation of the membranes around the brain or
spinal cord, is usually connected with severe summers. Many parts of Sudan
are in the midst of a heat wave, with temperatures in Khartoum reaching 110
degrees on Tuesday. Meningitis victims suffer from high fever, delirium,
vomiting, headache and rigidity.
