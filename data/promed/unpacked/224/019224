Authorities of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) remain
uncertain over a possible outbreak of swine fever, also known as
"lightening disease" for the speed with which affected animals die
from this disease. According to Adolfo Rios, head of the General
Directorate of Animal and Plant Health (DSVA), they have not as yet
confirmed that 15 pigs on a farm in San Miguel have died from this
disease. This week, 35 more from the same farm were sacrificed
because they were in contact with sick animals.

Rios said that authorities have done 2 tests and that they are
waiting for the results of a 3rd test. The 1st had negative results;
the 2nd was inconclusive. The official added that due to August
holidays, they have not been able to send other specimens to
Nicaragua, a country where they perform more specialized analyses.

El Salvador was on the verge of being declared free from classical
swine fever, so with this alert, they will lose their international
accreditation.

Three years ago, the country approached the international
organization to be declared free of classical swine fever. Two years
after this certification, it was declared unnecessary to vaccinate
the animals as a method of prevention.

The concern of the authorities is that without certification
indicating that the country is free of swine fever, it is impossible
to export pork-derived products.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock indicated that the sick
pigs were not produced in the country, and they suspect that the
infection came from other Central American countries.

[Checking the OIE records, El Salvador has not reported CSF since
2001, when there was a single outbreak. Since then, they have
vaccinated 15 876 pigs in 2002, 14 035 (2003), 21 423 (2004), 90 000
(2005), 169 609 (2006), and none in 2007. The swine population had
grown from 2005 with 222 530 to 3 054 000 in 2007. There are ongoing
CSF problems in the 3 neighboring countries of Guatemala, Honduras
and Nicaragua, so the Salvadoran suspicions are well grounded, which
of course raises the question of why the farm was allowed to import
from one of these countries. Further information from knowledgeable
sources will be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
