Doctors in Rangoon are concerned about an apparently unexplained increase in recurrent influenza infections this rainy season [2014]. Seasonal flu is widespread in the city during the transitions between seasons, but those who are infected develop some immunity, reducing the chance of re-infection in the same year. This rainy season, however, doctors say that more patients than usual are returning with flu -- although with slightly different symptoms -- a 2nd time or more. "I have patients who are going through their 4th time getting sick from flu this year [2014]," said Dr. Sein Sein, who runs a clinic in Hledan Township. A primary care doctor for more than 25 years, she said she has not experienced this kind of recurrent flu before.

Patients infected with the recurrent flu show different symptoms from those getting sick for the 1st time in the season. A person infected with the common seasonal flu will experience sneezing, coughing, headaches and muscle pain. "The people who are sick for the 2nd, 3rd or 4th time may still have slight headaches, but mostly, their main complaint is a severe sore throat," Dr. Sein Sein said.

The reason behind the sudden emergence of the recurrent influenza is unknown. Dr. Thant Syn, a primary care physician in Rangoon, suggested 2 possible reasons: "It might be because immunity is only partially developed by the body as a natural defense to invading organisms. So people who have contracted flu are still liable to re-infection. Another possible cause, though less likely, might be that people are infected again by different strains of influenza. Because the immunity imparted by the body's defense mechanism is specific to each strain of influenza, a person can get infected again if his body is invaded by a different strain of flu."

Those with recurrent flu are advised to rest well, avoid crowded places, and eat bland food. Dr. Thant Syn said that a less orthodox remedy employing vinegar also appeared to work. "Gargling with vinegar and drinking boiled ginger water have produced visible improvements in my patients," Dr. Thant Syn said.

[In the most recent WHO Global Influenza Update [28 Jul 2014, Influenza Update Number 216 http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/latest_update_GIP_surveillance/en/], it is recorded that in Eastern Asia, influenza activity is at inter-seasonal levels in most countries, with influenza A(H3N2) virus and influenza B virus predominating. Influenza activity still increased slightly in the southern region of China, however, mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) viruses.

No information is provided in the above report from Rangoon regarding the identity of the initially predominating influenza virus in the city. It seems more likely, therefore, that Rangoon has been exposed sequentially to several serologically distinct human respiratory viruses, of which there are many: such as adenoviruses, coronaviruses, parainfluenzaviruses, human metapneumoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses or even rhinoviruses.

Further information would be appreciated. Gargling with vinegar and drinking boiled ginger water seems rather drastic and not specific for remedying virus infection. - Mod.CP
