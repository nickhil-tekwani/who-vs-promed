In the ongoing dialogue about the human anthrax vaccine used in the United
States, I am not sure that everyone realizes that the vaccine used in the
trial reported by Brachman et al was not produced in the same manner as the
current vaccine. The current vaccine may actually be more effective than
the original version.
The production strains are different in the two versions, with the current
production strain elaborating relatively more PA and less LF and EF than
the original strain. In the original vaccine, the production strain was
grown in the defined medium 599 under aerobic conditions. In the current
vaccine, the production strain is grown in the defined medium 1095 under
anaerobic (microaerophilic) conditions. The change in culture methodology
resulted in greater elaboration of PA into the culture medium (a four to
six-fold increase.) The original vaccine utilized alum precipitation to
remove the PA from the culture filtrate, and the current vaccine uses
aluminum hydroxide gel adsorption for this purpose. The aluminum hydroxide
gel adsorption was adopted because the alum precipitation method did not
work well with the anaerobic product.
The preservative used in the original vaccine was thimerosal, and the
current preservative is benzethonium chloride. Formalin is used as a
stabilizer in the current vaccine, but was not used in the original
vaccine. The use of benzethonium chloride and formalin enhanced stability
and bioavailability of the antigen. When tested in guinea pigs and mice,
the current version imparted significantly greater protection than the
original vaccine.
In the trial of the original vaccine reported by Brachman et al, 21 cases
of cutaneous anthrax were reported - 18 in persons receiving either placebo
or no vaccine, 2 in persons who had received three doses of vaccine with 5
and 13 months having elapsed since the last dose, and 1 in an individual
who had received two doses of vaccine with about 12 to 13 days since the
last dose. Five inhalational vaccine cases occurred - all in persons
receiving either placebo or no vaccine.
By way of comparison, 27 cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported in
association with high risk industries in the period 1962 - 1971, a time
when the current vaccine was being used. Only 3 of the 27 patients had
received any vaccine. One had received a single dose 7 months prior to
onset, and two had received two doses, with 2 to 4 days elapsing since the
last dose. To the present date, I am unaware of any person who has
developed any form of anthrax after receiving either 2 doses of the current
vaccine with 7 or more days elapsing since the last dose or 3 doses of the
current vaccine regardless of time elapsed since the third dose.
Vaccine recipients have been exposed to _B. anthracis_ strains from many
areas of the world. Exposure has occurred in a variety of settings -
agriculture and industry related as well as in laboratories. Many of the
vaccinees working in industry have inhaled varying numbers of spores, often
on a daily basis while working.
