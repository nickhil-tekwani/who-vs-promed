An air conditioning cooling tower is to blame for an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease that landed 6 people in the hospital in a single south-central London neighbourhood, public health officials announced Thursday [26 Sep 2019].

Middlesex-London Health Unit inspectors collected samples from different areas in the neighbourhood to test for the presence of _Legionella_ bacteria, the germ that causes Legionnaires' disease. Laboratory testing confirmed samples from a cooling tower were a genetic match to the bacteria that made 6 people sick, the health unit says.

"The investigation and search for a cause were still active at the time, but laboratory reports received Tuesday [24 Sep 2019] drew a conclusive link for the largest cluster of cases," the London-area public health authority said in a statement Thursday [26 Sep 2019].

The health unit declined to release the exact location of the Legionnaires' disease cluster but said it did not involve people from the same address. Since sources of _Legionella_ can crop [up] temporarily then go away on their own, public health officials did not issue a warning to other residents in the area.

All 6 adults were hospitalized and are now recovering at home, the health unit says.

"We have taken extensive measures to ensure that this equipment no longer poses a threat to human health," associate medical officer of health Alex Summers said in a statement.

_Legionella_ bacteria exist in the environment. Most people contract the illness by inhaling water or soil that contains the bacteria. Elderly people and people with compromised immune systems are most vulnerable to a _Legionella_ infection. Legionnaires' disease causes severe pneumonia, fever, and muscle aches and can be fatal.

In a typical year, the health unit would see about 6 cases of _Legionella_ infection. To date, the London-area public health authority has encountered 15, 6 of which are linked.
