Dr. Raman Kumar Sharma, Chief Medical Officer (CMO), Una, today [24 Oct 2021] said that 2 people with scrub typhus bacterial infection had been reported in the district [Una]. The patients were being given free treatment at government health institutions.

The CMO said the district Health Department had already issued an advisory to the public regarding the symptoms of scrub typhus, caused by the bite of infected mites that live on rats. The ongoing climatic conditions were conducive for the spread of the disease and people needed to take care, he stated.

Dr. Sharma said the symptoms included headache, chilling sensation and fever, adding that these get severe as the infection increases and nodules could form on the neck, in armpits and groin area. If untreated, the infection could even lead to failure of vital organs. He advised people having such symptoms to report to the nearest government health facility for free diagnosis and treatment.

[We are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in the 2 patients. The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species, including _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like organism that is the cause of scrub typhus. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23763648_Validity_of_the_Weil-Felix_test_in_the_diagnosis_of_acute_rickettsial_infections_in_Sri_Lanka).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India.

Scrub typhus is transmitted by the bite of chiggers, the larval stage of infected mites. Mites serve as both the vector and reservoir for _O. tsutsugamushi_. Larvae can also acquire _O. tsutsugamushi_ from infected rodents and while co-feeding on uninfected rodents with infected larvae (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6136631/).

Chiggers, after feeding on their hosts, drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Una is city with a population of 18 722 residents in 2011, and headquarters of Una district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Una,_Himachal_Pradesh).
