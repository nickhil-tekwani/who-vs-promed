At least 80 dead birds have been found in a farm in the
Kosovo village of Vustria. Authorities in the region were
immediately informed, the Macedonian television A1 reported.
Official representatives of Kosovo authorities confirmed the
information, adding that analyses are being conducted to
check whether those are cases of bird flu.
Kosovo banned the import of poultry from Turkey and Romania
last week.
