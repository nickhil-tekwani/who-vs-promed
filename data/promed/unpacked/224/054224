New South Wales (NSW) has been hard hit by the winter flu season and the Illawarra-Shoalhaven region is no exception. Experts from the Influenza Specialist Group (ISG) have warned of a particularly severe season in NSW with 2.5 times more people visiting the emergency department with flu-like illnesses than at the same time last year [2011].

NSW is the 2nd worst state affected by the flu, with 2391 diagnosed cases up until 10 Jul 2012. Experts believe this is only the tip of the iceberg, as thousands more cases are going undiagnosed. General manager of the Southern Hospitals Network Sue Browbank told a meeting at Lake Tabourie last week that the flu season was "certainly upon us," and hospitals throughout the region had been extremely busy as a result. She said there had been twice as many people presenting with flu-like symptoms at emergency departments in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven compared to the same period last year [2011]. GPs, she said, were also feeling the squeeze.

ISG [Influenza Special Group] Director and University of Sydney immunisation expert Professor Robert Booey said that to make matters worse, the majority of cases diagnosed state-wide were the H3N2 strain. He said this strain was most likely to have significant impact and cause deaths and hospitalisation when seen in high levels. Young infants are considered at particular risk. Professor Booey said the fact that the H3N2 and the Type B strains hadn't been prominent in the community for the past few years could increase this season's severity. "The prominence of the H3N2 strain this season could mean we're in for a severe year, especially because we can expect to see more deaths and hospital admissions," he said.

As reported previously in the Times, the ISG, the Illawarra-Shoalhaven Medicare Local, and the NSW Ambulance Service all encouraged people to get vaccinated against influenza in the lead up to winter. People are also being encouraged to take preventative measures with personal hygiene such as covering their mouth when coughing and washing their hands regularly to help reduce the risk of contracting the flu virus. ISG chair Dr Alan Hampson said there was still a "small window of opportunity" for those people wanting to vaccinate themselves against influenza but warned that that window was "rapidly closing." He said it takes approximately 2 weeks for somebody to become fully immune.

The influenza virus can be spread through the air by people failing to cover their mouths when they cough, but respiratory secretions on people's hands mean it can also be spread through shared use of computer keyboards and telephones, by shaking hands, and by simply opening doors. Dr Hampson urged anyone unlucky enough to contract the flu to obtain prescription medicine and to stay at home to avoid spreading it to others.

Research released by the Influenza Specialist Group earlier this year [2012] indicates that the majority of Australians would risk the health of their colleagues by going to work sick because they don't want to let them down or miss a deadline. ISG believes "Presenteeism" [!] -- the phenomenon where employees turn up to work when sick -- is costing the economy more than AUD 34 billion [USD 35.5 billion] a year and potentially risking lives. "People need to take the flu much more seriously as it is a potentially fatal disease that is estimated to cause more deaths than accidents on roads," Dr Hampson said earlier this year [2012].

There's been an unusually severe outbreak of influenza in Canterbury, with numbers 4 times the national average and hospitals struggling to cope with the patient influx. Doctors are putting it down to the severe cold and people living and working in close proximity in damaged buildings after the earthquake.

There are a lot of absentees at Central New Brighton primary. Principal Toni Burnside says more than 1/3rd of the students and staff have been off sick this winter. "I've sent 10 children home; classes have dropped from 22 to 12. Even the commissioners overseeing the Canterbury Earthquake Royal Commission are not immune. It's on hold until Monday [23 Jul 2012]. "Commissioner Carter has succumbed to the flu or whatever it is; he's feverish, and he's returning to Auckland," says Justice Mark Cooper.

Christchurch hospital has treated 105 influenza patients this year [2012], with 67 admitted in the last 2 weeks. Virologist Lance Jennings says it's 4 times above the national average, and with the number of cases expected to rise in the coming weeks, he's advising Cantabrians it's still not too late to get a flu jab.

[The higher prevalence of influenza this year (2012) in Australia and New Zealand may be a reflection of the predominance of a strain of H3N2-type influenza virus that has antigenic characteristics slightly divergent from those of the current Southern Hemisphere vaccine H3N2 virus. However, it is perhaps too early in the Southern Hemisphere influenza season to be certain.
