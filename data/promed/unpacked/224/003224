[1] Turkey: reporting changes
Date: Thu 10 Dec 2020

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-12-turkey-adjusts-coronavirus-cases-million.html


Turkey has recorded nearly 1.75 million cases since the start of the pandemic, the health ministry said on Thursday [10 Dec 2020], after releasing a significantly lower toll including only patients requiring medical care. Officials had previously only published the number of coronavirus "patients" but last month [November 2020] returned to publishing the total number of cases.

The Turkish Medical Association had warned that the daily number of cases was higher than the government's figures, an average of around 30 000 a week. The health ministry said on Thursday [10 Dec 2020] there were 1 748 567 cases since the 1st confirmed infection in March [2020], jumping from 955 956 announced earlier in the day. The number of daily deaths also reached a record high on Thursday [10 Dec 2020] of 220, pushing the total to 15 751.

As the outbreak worsens, Ankara ordered the return of weekend lockdowns last weekend [5-6 Dec 2020] and there is discussion of a possible 4-day curfew during the New Year period. Schools have been closed since November [2020] while restaurants and cafes can only provide takeaway service. There is also a curfew between 1800 GMT and 0200 GMT on weekdays but doctors' groups and the opposition have called for stricter measures.

[The change in reporting criteria occurred on 26 Nov 2020 when Turkey reported over 36 000 cases in the preceding 24 hours when previous days were running at approximately 6000 cases per 24-hour period (COVID-19 update (509): oral shedding, South Korea prisons, WHO, global 20201127.7975333 and COVID-19 update (514): Turkey restrictions, transmission by settings, WHO, global 20201201.7983712). But there was not a "catch-up for the period prior to 26 Nov 2020, and today's (10 Dec 2020) increase of over 800 000 newly confirmed cases (see item [5] below) probably reflects the backlog of cases. - Mod.MPP]

https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/10/fda-advisory-panel-recommends-covid-vaccine/


Federal advisers endorsed the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine on Thursday [10 Dec 2020], making it all but certain the Food and Drug Administration will authorize the vaccine on an emergency basis within hours or days, kicking off an unprecedented effort to inoculate enough Americans to stop a rampaging pandemic.

But the prospect of relief from the coronavirus came on a day when 107 000 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and a record 3347 deaths were reported by state health departments, topping the milestone reached one day earlier. Within days, the country will likely surpass 300 000 deaths since the pandemic's arrival.

The worsening situation has heightened attention to the vaccine approval process. The thumbs up from the FDA's vaccine advisory committee was the culmination of an all-day meeting during which the panel heard presentations on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, including plans to monitor its longer-term safety.

The key moment came just after 5:30 pm, when the agency asked its independent advisers: "Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?" The committee voted yes, 17 in favor, 4 against, and one abstained.

Panel members did not have an opportunity to explain their votes, but at least 2 dissenters objected to inclusion of 16- and 17-year-olds, given what they described as the low risk of severe disease in that age group and how few had participated in the trial. "I would have voted 'yes' most enthusiastically had the language been ' ... 18 years of age and older,' " said David Kim, director of the division of vaccines in the Office of Infectious Disease and HIV/AIDS Policy in the Department of Health and Human Services. Those arguments were vehemently disputed by panel member Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. "Kids in our hospital have had cardiac anomalies," he said. "We have clear evidence of benefit and all we have on the other side is theoretical risk."

If as expected, the FDA follows quickly with an emergency [use] authorization [EUA], the shots will start being moved to the states within 24 hours, according to officials at Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration's effort to accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines. Inoculations could begin early next week.

After the FDA authorization, an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will vote on whether to recommend the vaccine and for which groups. First in line to be inoculated are health care personnel and residents and staff of long-term care facilities, according to its previous recommendations. But states will have the final say on who gets the 1st shots and where they are administered.

Those considerations are complicated by extreme logistics challenges, including the sub-Antarctic storage temperatures the vaccine requires.

The 2-shot vaccine, which has been shown to be 95 percent effective in randomized trials involving thousands of people, has already been approved by the United Kingdom, Canada, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. US officials, however, have hewed to a more rigorous approval process that they believe will boost confidence in the vaccine among the general public. Surveys show many people in the US remain unsure about the safety of the vaccines and whether they will get the shots.

"The American public demands and deserves a rigorous, comprehensive and independent review of the data," said Doran Fink, deputy director of the FDA's Division of Vaccines and Related Products. "That is what FDA physicians and scientists, all of us career public health servants, have been doing over days, nights, weekends, and, yes, over the Thanksgiving holiday [26-30 Nov 2020]."

A sense of urgency hung over the hearing, however. Kathrin Jansen, Pfizer's head of vaccine research and development, told the panel that "with the high efficacy and good safety profile shown for our vaccine, and the pandemic essentially out of control, vaccine introduction is an urgent need."

Still, the vaccine will not eliminate a staggering loss of life anticipated this winter, CDC Director Robert Redfield said Thursday [10 Dec 2020] to the Council on Foreign Relations. "We are in the time frame now that, probably for the next 60 to 90 days, we're going to have more deaths per day than we had at 9/11 [terrorist attacks] or we had at Pearl Harbor [naval base, a surprise attack by Japanese forces on 7 Dec 1941]," he said.

During the meeting, committee members pressed the FDA on the vaccine's safety, raising questions about allergic reactions reported Wednesday [9 Dec 2020] when British regulators ordered hospitals to avoid giving the shots to people with a history of "significant" allergic reactions. That directive came after 2 healthcare workers had adverse reactions after receiving the 1st dose of the vaccine, which British regulators authorized last week [week of 1 Dec 2020]. British authorities said both workers have a history of serious allergies.

Susan Wollersheim, a medical officer in the FDA's Office of Vaccines Research and Review, said the FDA has asked Pfizer to monitor vaccine recipients for "anaphylactic reactions" as a potential risk following the British report. Much remains unknown about the cases in the United Kingdom, and experts said more data was urgently needed. A specific study could be done to see if the vaccine carried risk to people with severe allergies, but some suggested the concerns were overblown. "There are tens of millions of people in this country that carry EpiPens because they have peanut allergies and egg allergies," Offit said. "They are going to believe that they can't get this vaccine. That is a lot of people."

In its review, the FDA found a slightly higher number of adverse events -- "potentially representing allergic reactions" -- in the group that received the vaccine, compared with those who got the placebo. There were 137 "hypersensitivity-related" reactions to the vaccine, compared with 111 such events in the placebo group. But there were no cases of anaphylactic reactions in the trial.

Pregnant women have been excluded from coronavirus vaccine trials, but the FDA's limited data suggests no specific risk to pregnant women or a fetus. Fink said the agency is expecting results later this month [December 2020] from a developmental and reproductive study in animals that could help elucidate risks but said the agency will likely allow pregnant women and their doctors to decide whether to take the vaccine.

An authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech is the first of what health experts hope will be several vaccines to cross the finish line. Next to be considered is Moderna's vaccine. The FDA will release its assessment of that vaccine on Tuesday [15 Dec 2020] and the advisory committee will review it on [17 Dec 2020]. If it gets favorable evaluations, as expected, the FDA is likely to authorize that vaccine within days.

Between the 2 vaccines, government officials project having 40 million doses by year's end -- enough to fully vaccinate 20 million people with the 2-shot regimen.

Despite the committee's overwhelming consensus that the vaccine is safe and effective, there was at least one cautionary note about the absence of long-term data. A Oveta Fuller, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan, voted against the recommendation, expressing concerns about the lack of long-term safety data for a vaccine technology not used before in humans. She called the risk "limited" but predicted "the uptake in the community is going to be very poor."

The panel also engaged in extensive debate over how to handle the difficult issue of when to give participants who received a placebo access to the vaccine. Some participants have called for it, but the FDA has expressed concerns that "unblinding" the continuing trial could hurt efforts to collect longer-term safety data.

Pfizer officials on Thursday [10 Dec 2020] proposed to the FDA that participants in the placebo group would be allowed to access the vaccine when they become eligible under guidelines for the general public. Those guidelines are being issued by federal, state, and local governments.

In preparation for the meeting, the FDA on Tuesday [8 Dec 2020] published a 53-page evaluation saying the vaccine appears to meet the standards it laid out in recent months for emergency authorization. The agency has said a vaccine must be at least 50 percent effective; its own scientists confirmed Pfizer's assessment that the vaccine regimen was 95 percent effective at preventing the coronavirus in a large clinical trial.

On safety, the FDA found that the vaccine has "a favorable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance of an [emergency authorization]." The vaccine caused several side effects, including sore arms, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain, and chills, but they typically disappeared after a day or 2. Pfizer provided the agency with a median of 2 months of follow-up on 38 000 participants in the trial.

The one surprise in the report was that the 1st shot in the 2-dose regimen was 52 percent protective against the coronavirus in the 3 weeks between the 2 shots. But the FDA noted that there wasn't enough data to draw firm conclusions about the efficacy of a single shot.

Government officials have said they plan to hold back supplies for the 2nd shots, which must be given 3 weeks later, to ensure sufficient supply of the shot that provides people get complete protection. But the signal of early protection from a single dose has led some to suggest that may not be the best way to use limited doses in the midst of surging cases.

During the portion of the FDA's advisory committee meeting for the general public, some expressed concerns about green lighting a vaccine that was so rapidly developed and reviewed. Others like Evan Fein expressed strong support. Fein told the panel he was a clinical trial participant at New York University and strongly urged quick action. He said he is certain he got the vaccine last summer [2020] -- not a placebo -- because he had fatigue, fever, and muscle aches after the 2nd shot. But he said there were no longer-term side effects.

He said it would be "immoral and unethical" to not authorize the vaccine.

[Given the situation in the USA, with totally out of control transmission ongoing, the start of a vaccination program couldn't come soon enough. In deciding vaccine recommendations, an important comparison to assess is the risk from the actual disease vs the risk from the vaccine. In the USA currently, the risk from the disease is very high, and preliminary clinical trial results are demonstrating a low risk from the vaccine. We are all hoping there won't be any longer term surprise risks of the vaccine, but in a country that has been politically polarized so that one faction refuses to adhere to NPIs (nonpharmaceutical interventions), a vaccine couldn't arrive too soon.

The FDA vaccine review document is definitely worth reading. (https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). - Mod.MPP

[3] Australia: vaccine trial halted
Date: Thu 10 Dec 2020
Source: BBC News [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-55269381


A promising Australian candidate for a coronavirus vaccine has been abandoned after trial participants returned false HIV positive results.

Australia had previously agreed to buy 51 million doses of the vaccine being developed by Australian firm CSL and the University of Queensland (UQ). The government said orders of other vaccines would now fill the shortfall. CSL and UQ stressed that the positive results were false -- meaning trial participants' health was not at risk.

The Australian government said it had now entered an agreement for the Novavax vaccine, and upped its existing order of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

The UK was the first to begin rolling out a vaccine from Pfizer this week.

What happened with the UQ/CSL vaccine?
--------------------------------------
The vaccine had been in stage one of trials, and proving to be effective in making antibodies. But it also generated HIV antibodies in some recipients -- which meant it showed false positives for HIV. Further testing proved the HIV wasn't there. CSL and UQ said fixing the flaw would take about a year, prompting a decision to abandon the trial. "It was likely to work. But we knew that we didn't want to have any issues with confidence, and this false-positive test may have caused some confusion and lack of confidence," said Brendan Murphy, secretary of Australia's Department of Health.

Vaccine co-lead Paul Young described the decision as "devastating" after 11 months of "living and breathing this project". "While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone's priority," he said.

What does it mean for Australia?
--------------------------------
Australia has all but eliminated community transmission of the virus, after getting on top of outbreaks in recent months.

Prof Murphy said the nation was in a "wonderful position" at present, but there would be "full population coverage" from 2 vaccines in 2021. "We don't need emergency approval -- we're in a good position because we've controlled the virus," he said on Friday [11 Dec 2020]. "So I'm very confident about the successful vaccination strategy that we'll be facing next year [2021]."

The government said it had prepared for this sort of situation and as such had "spread the risk" with multiple deals for vaccines. Early 2021 is still listed as when the 1st vaccines -- most likely from Oxford/AstraZeneca -- are scheduled to be given to Australians.

Australia has a population of 25 million people. It recorded just one case of local transmission in the past week. The nation has reported 908 deaths and 28 000 cases so far during the pandemic -- far fewer than many nations.

It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures, and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths. Victoria crushed the country's worst outbreak after 4 months of a severe lockdown in the state capital, Melbourne.

The Oxford vaccine has been found to be "safe and effective", according to researchers, but is awaiting approval from regulators around the world. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that focusing resources on manufacturing successful vaccines would mean "we are more likely to have the entire population vaccinated earlier rather than later".

[The vaccine in question -- the UQ/CSL vaccine used a fragment of the HIV virus (non-infectious) using a signature "molecular clamp" technology that was formulated with parts of an HIV protein. When injected, these prompted the production of antibodies that were picked up in a range of HIV tests. In other words, if the vaccine had been widely rolled out, this could lead many people to think they had HIV when they didn't. (https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/123682877/covid19-how-did-the-university-of-queenslands-vaccine-fail-due-to-false-positive-hiv-tests-a-vaccine-expert-explains).

A BloombergQuint report (https://www.bloombergquint.com/coronavirus-outbreak/australia-cancels-order-for-csl-vaccine-as-trial-stumbles) submitted by Mary Marshall (<mjm2020@google mail.com>) mentioned that even without the UQ/CSL vaccine, the country had ordered more than 140 million doses of vaccine from other companies -- with a population of approximately 25 million people, there are more than enough doses for the whole country. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, Turkey (823 225) (see section [1] above for explanation of major change in reported numbers) the USA (219 351), Brazil (53 425), and India (34 666) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 626 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (9-10 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (13 countries) include Turkey, USA, Brazil, India, Germany (28 179), Russia (27 927), UK (20 964), Italy, (16 998), France (13 750), Poland (13 750), Ukraine (13 371), Mexico (11 897), and Iran (10 403). A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 34 of the 62 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 22.6%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.3%. (note that the major increase in cases reported by Turkey today -- 10 Dec 2020 -- will influence comparative changes for the next 13 days). The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (16.9%) and reported deaths (27.0%) The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 214 885 and newly reported deaths is 2409.

Impression: The global daily reported cases shows a marked increase due to the over 800 000 cases reported by Turkey today. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. With the major increase in reported cases by Turkey, it is now the 15th country to report a cumulative case count greater than 1 million. The global total is now over 70 million cases. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission although the rate of increase may be slowing down. - Mod.MPP]
