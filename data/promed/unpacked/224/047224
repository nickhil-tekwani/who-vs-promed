India: 5 Deaths in Hepatitis Outbreak in Punjab
--------------------------------------------------
At least 5 people have died in an outbreak of jaundice in the
suburbs of Talagang. Scores of people have been admitted to
public and private hospitals [suffering jaundice]. The hospital
administrations are facing immense problems in dealing with the
dozens of jaundice patients owing to the limited facilities available.
Tehsil Headquarter Hospital (THQ) reportedly had nothing to
control this epidemic in the outskirts of Talagang as the health
administration has been unable to establish the emergency point or
mobile vaccination teams for the patients so far.

[Resort to control by vaccination suggests that this outbreak of
jaundice may be a consequence of hepatitis A virus infection.
However, if contamination of water supplies is the cause of the
outbreak, either hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus could be the
etiologic agent.
Hepatitis E virus is prevalent in parts of India, and no vaccine is
currently available. Further information would be appreciated
concerning the source of the outbreak and the identity of the
infectious agent. - Mod.CP]
