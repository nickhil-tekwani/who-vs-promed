Whatcom County _E. coli_ O157 outbreak update
---------------------------------------------
The Whatcom County Health Department (WCHD) is investigating an outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ O157 associated with the Milk Makers Fest that was held at the Northwest Fairgrounds in Lynden on 21-23 Apr 2015. Over a thousand primary school children from all of the school districts in Whatcom County attended the event. Most of the cases involve children who attended the event. Several older children involved with the event and some adults and close contacts of cases have also become ill.

WCHD is continuing to interview cases to determine if there was a common food or water source or activity, such as the petting zoo or other contact with livestock. Washington State Department of Health Communicable Disease Epidemiology is assisting with the outbreak investigation.

Cumulative total: 22 cases* (7 cases have been hospitalized), 19 probable cases ** Change since last report of 1 May 2015: +4 cases, +1 probable cases, +2 hospitalizations

* Cases include those with positive labs (preliminary presumptive positive O157 and final confirmed positives), and clinical cases with close contact with a case with positive or presumptive positive labs.
** Probable cases are cases with clinical symptoms and were associated with the event, but lab results are not available or labs were not done.

The state public health lab is testing confirmed _E. coli_ O157 isolates for serogroup (to determine if O157:H7 or another related serogroup). Preliminary positive O157 isolates are regrown and have further testing done at a commercial lab to confirm O157. We expect to get the first results of serogroup testing from the state public health lab early this week.

[The number of suspected or proven cases of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ has jumped from 6 to 41 so far and appears to involve both adults and secondary cases as well as the children who attended the agricultural fair. While the petting zoo remains the primary suspect as the source of the EHEC, other sources are also being investigated. The serotype of the EHEC has confirmed to be O157, the prototypic serotype. The length of time since the end of the fair is now longer than the usual incubation period of the infection so if new cases are reported, they are secondary household cases or cases starting during the incubation period and subsequently being reported.
