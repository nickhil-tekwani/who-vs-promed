The Kurdistan Region has recorded a second infection with "hemorrhagic fever" in a citizen of Sinjar district in Nineveh Governorate. Zakho health director, Dr Shaker Abdel Rahman, said in a statement to Kurdish media that "a resident of Sinjar district was confirmed to have hemorrhagic fever, after he was suspected of hemorrhage due to the bleeding he was suffering from."

Abdul Rahman added, "the citizen was sent to Zakho in the beginning, and then he was sent to Dohuk, where the hospital sent his samples to the Baghdad Central Laboratory." He explained that "the affected person owns sheep and livestock, as he was suffering from some symptoms, and he was rushed to sleep in Zakho Hospital, and we suspected that he was infected, before it was confirmed."

It is noteworthy that this is the 2nd case of hemorrhagic fever in the Kurdistan region, and the 1st was recorded in Erbil a few days ago.

The Maysan Health Department has announced the registration of 13 cases of hemorrhagic fever in the governorate. The director general of Maysan Health, Dr Ali Mahmoud Al-Alaq, said, "the governorate has recorded 13 cases of hemorrhagic fever, 10 of which are confirmed."

Al-Alaq expressed his regret over the death of 2 people, noting that they arrived too late at the hospital. He stressed that the Department of Health has taken all measures to confront this disease, expressing his belief that dust storms have contributed to the elimination of ticks that transmit the disease.

Al-Allaq praised the role of veterinary clinics in facing the disease [spread/infection] by providing many treatments.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread disease caused by a tickborne virus (_Nairovirus_) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although several tick genera are capable of becoming infected with the CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

It is important to raise awareness about the risk factors of the disease, particularly in the population groups likely to be exposed to the virus, and educate them to take precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals.

Furthermore, appropriate capacity building and training of public health rapid response teams (RRT) should be carried out to equip them to control any future outbreaks of this anthropo-zoonotic disease. - Mod.UBA]
