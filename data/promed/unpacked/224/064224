Measles outbreak has affected 47 regions this year
--------------------------------------------------
Cases of measles have been recorded in 47 regions of Russia so far in 2012. Vaccination has been declared a priority throughout the Rissian Federation for high risk groups (health workers, teachers, students, trade workers, utilities, etc), as well as for nomadic people and migrants.

According to Rospotrebnadzor [the Health and Consumer Protection Agency], the largest number of cases of measles have been recorded in Moscow, St Petersburg, the Volgograd and Moscow Oblasts, and Stavropol Krai. The most affected have been children under one year of age, followed by children in their first years of life. Adults who had not been vaccinated previously have also been severely affected.

The national immunization calendar requires that all children should be vaccinated twice, first at 12 months and again in their 6th year. In addition, it is planned to vaccinate teenagers and adults up to the age of 35 who have no history of previous vaccination, or who have had only a single vaccination.

Measles is an acute viral infectious disease that spreads from person to person by airborne droplets. The disease is characterized by fever, intoxication, inflammation of the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, and a skin rash. In the absence of vacation measles can infect anyone, regardless of age.

Measles outbreak continues to spread in Merseyside
--------------------------------------------------
The Wirral has so far been in the clear -- but now health officials say there is one confirmed, two probable, and 12 possible cases. The majority of patients affected in the outbreak are in Liverpool, where there are 25 confirmed, 25 probable, and 32 possible cases.

A team of specialists from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the local NHS (National Health Service) is now investigating 48 laboratory confirmed cases, 37 probable cases, and 108 possible cases. Most of the cases are in children under the age of 5 years, who were not vaccinated at the optimum age of 13 months and babies and toddlers who are too young to be vaccinated. A small number of adults have also been affected.

Dr Roberto Vivancos, a consultant with the HPA’s Cheshire and Merseyside Health Protection Unit, said: "Measles is highly infectious and unvaccinated children are at risk when it gets into a community. Furthermore, when unvaccinated older children pick up an infection they can pass it on to vulnerable infants who are too young to be vaccinated. That would appear to be what’s happening in this outbreak."

Measles outbreak in Liverpool spreads across region
---------------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed measles cases in Merseyside has spread beyond Liverpool, health officials have said. The Health Protection Agency (HPA) is now investigating 48 confirmed cases, 37 probable cases, and 108 possible cases.

A measles outbreak was declared on 16 Feb 2012. The majority of patients are concentrated in the Liverpool area. But an HPA spokesman added: "We are also beginning to see cases that are further afield." There are now confirmed, probable and possible cases in central and eastern Cheshire, Halton and St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton, and Wirral [see preceding report. - Mod.CP] with probable and possible cases in adjacent Warrington and western Cheshire.

HPA data have also shown that more than 7000 children under the age of 5 in Merseyside were not vaccinated or only partially vaccinated. Dr Roberto Vivancos, a consultant with the HPA's Cheshire and Merseyside Health Protection Unit, said: "Measles is highly infectious and unvaccinated children are at risk when it gets into a community. Furthermore, when unvaccinated older children pick up an infection they can pass it on to vulnerable infants who are too young to be vaccinated. That would appear to be what's happening in this outbreak."

Primary care trusts on Merseyside are writing to the parents of every unvaccinated child urging them to contact their GP. The HPA is advising people with symptoms of measles to telephone their family GP for advice before attending surgeries. Symptoms include a fever, cough, sore eyes, and a rash that develops over 3 to 4 days, beginning with the face and head and spreading down the body.

Anyone who believes they may have the disease should stay away from school, nursery, or work until at least 4 days have elapsed since the rash developed and avoid contact with pregnant women who are more vulnerable to infection.

Surge in measles deaths
-----------------------
SANA'A: Measles has killed 126 children in Yemen since mid-2011, a consequence of the breakdown of basic health services during the year-long political crisis. In response to the big increase in reported cases and deaths due to measles, the Yemeni government has appealed for international assistance and an outbreak-response vaccination campaign will begin in the hardest-hit regions on 10 Mar 2012.

"It's very sad that we were talking about elimination in 2010, and now we are dealing with an outbreak," said Arwa Baider, a child health programme officer at the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF). The latest statistics from the Health Ministry at the end of February report that 3767 cases of measles have been confirmed, resulting in 126 deaths, since mid-2011. By comparison, in the 3 years from the beginning of 2007 until the end of 2009, the Ministry reported a total of 211 cases and no deaths due to measles.

Seventy per cent of these cases, and all of the deaths, were among children under 5 years of age. Most of the cases and deaths have occurred in the past 4 months. Measles has been reported across the country, but has been concentrated in Abyan, Aden, Al Bayda, Shabwa, Dhamar, Lahj, Amran, and Sa'dah governorates.

"The disease is spreading fast, reaching highly populated areas as well as areas with high levels of acute malnutrition," Geert Cappelaere, a representative of UNICEF in Yemen, told IRIN. "There is a very valid concern of many more deaths if a massive country-wide immunization campaign is not started immediately."

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles outbreaks can be particularly deadly in countries recovering from conflict. Damage to health infrastructure and health services interrupts routine immunization, and overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection.

"The outbreak is a direct result of a decrease in routine immunization services during 2011; which is a direct result of the 2011 conflicts," added Cappelaere. In conflict-affected areas doctors reported being unable to deliver vaccinations because they were stopped at checkpoints, short of staff, or the refrigerated vaccines spoiled due to electricity cuts. In July 2011, WHO reported that fuel shortages had disrupted the cold chain supply system, resulting in the closure of 30 per cent of immunization facilities.

Immunization rates also decreased in some areas, such as Abyan, due to a "resurgence of radical religious views -- negative views -- about vaccination," said the Ministry of Health's director-general of family health, Ali Jahhaf. "Radical religious groups say that vaccination is not needed, it's against God's will and so on. Some communities believe this and started to resist or not accept vaccination. This is one of the reasons why in those areas we see pockets of lower vaccination coverage."

Jahhaf added that the political crisis and armed confrontations of 2011 had increased the "immunity gap", or the number of children who are not immunized, to a level large enough to cause outbreaks. "Our routine coverage is now not up to the level where you can have general community immunity."

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease. Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated with the disease, more common in children under the age of 5. Complications include blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea and dehydration, ear infections, and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

In Yemen, the measles crisis is more acute because of the country's high levels of malnutrition. Severe measles is more likely to develop among poorly nourished children, whose weakened immunity leaves them vulnerable to the complications caused by measles. According to UNICEF, 58 per cent of Yemeni children are stunted and are chronically malnourished -- the second highest rate in the world after Afghanistan. In the worst-affected parts of the country, 30 per cent of children suffer from acute malnutrition, a level twice as high as the internationally recognized emergency threshold, and on a par with parts of southern Somalia.

The Yemeni government has appealed for international assistance to help the country cope with its humanitarian crisis. In January prime minister Mohammed Basindwa toured Gulf capitals to appeal for humanitarian aid during Yemen's political transition. In response to the measles outbreaks, UNICEF in partnership with the Ministry of Health, WHO, and the US Agency for International Development, will launch the first phase of an outbreak-response vaccination campaign on 10 March in 7 of the worst-affected governorates: Abyan, Aden, Lahj, Shabwa, Dahmar, Al Bayda, and Sa’dah. The second phase of the campaign will broaden vaccination across the country, but is dependent on additional funding. The cost of vaccinating 8 million children is about USD 9 million.

Taiwan reports year's first imported measles case
-------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has confirmed Taiwan's first imported measles case this year, which involves a Taiwanese American man who traveled from India to Taiwan for a family reunion in February 2012. The 21 year old university student in India flew to Taiwan on 22 Feb 2012 on a Thai Airways flight he boarded in Bangkok, the transit stop of his journey from India to Taiwan, according to a CDC statement released on Friday. The man came down with a fever the next day, and then started to notice a skin rash. It was confirmed he had contracted measles on 8 Mar 2012, the statement said. The man has now recovered, it added.

Quarantine inspectors believed that the man had been infected with the measles virus in India. CDC deputy director general Chow Jih-haw said the CDC had contacted 3 passengers who had been sitting close to the patient on the Thai Airways flight, 25 medical personnel, and people the patient had come into contact with while undergoing emergency medical treatment, as well as the patient's family members. So far none of the people had developed any symptoms of measles, he said.

However, because measles is more highly contagious than influenza, the CDC has warned the relevant health authorities to pay attention to the condition of the travelers who had been sitting close to the student when they reached their final destination, Chow added.

Meanwhile, the CDC is monitoring the health of a Thai traveler who is now still in Taiwan, he said. In addition, the CDC also found that the Taiwanese American patient boarded an express train bound for Kaohsiung at 4 p.m. on 24 Feb in Taipei, and disembarked at a station in Yunlin County. People who had also taken the train are reminded to monitor their health and be on the alert for a possible infection. A self-examination period of 18 days (to end on 13 March) is recommended, the CDC said.

Measles, also called rubeola, is a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It causes a skin rash all over the body and flu-like symptoms, including a fever, cough, and runny nose.

[The number of countries reporting new outbreaks of measles is in decline in relation to renewed emphasis on all-inclusive vaccination programmes.

However, a consequence of the decline in measles vaccination (employing the almost universal triple MMR vaccine) may be an increased prevalence of of rubella virus infection and a concomitant incidence of congenital rubella syndrome. This situation is discussed in a letter to the editor of Eurosurveillance 2012; 17(10), 08 March from T Derrough, S Bacci, and P L Lopalco: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20106. - Mod.CP]
