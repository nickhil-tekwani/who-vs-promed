"It turns out that blood donated by 3 Britons suffering from the mad cow
disease (vCJD) has entered Turkey as well as tons of animal feed which
carry the same risk over the past 4 months. The Health Ministry has sought
information from a court in Italy which is investigating the potentially
dangerous animal feed imported from Britain in 1991 and 1994, while the
manufacturer admits that as much as 50 percent of the product may have been
polluted."

Checks For Mad Cow Disease Inadequate
-----------------------------------------------
Russia's checks for beef tainted with mad cow disease are inadequate, a top
[Russian Agriculture Ministry official said Monday. According to the
ministry only 400 samples a year are obtained from cattle to test them for
the presence of BSE, which has been linked to a similar brain-wasting
disease in humans. Russia has banned imports of beef from Britain. Recent
raids on markets in Moscow showed that 60 percent of the beef sold there
"came from nobody knows where," Itar-Tass, the official news agency, said.
