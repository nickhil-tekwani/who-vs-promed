The Straits Times has learnt 5 Bangladeshi workers staying at 2 different dormitories tested positive for measles this month [June 2019].

A spokesman for MOH said the ministry is continuing to monitor the situation and that there is currently no evidence of community spread from the cases.

The incidents are not linked and MOH said the workers are also no longer infectious.

The spokesman added: "MOH has engaged the dormitories, employers, and foreign workers to undertake precautionary measures.

"These include enhanced monitoring, vaccination of close contacts who do not have proof of vaccination or immunity, closely monitoring the health of the identified close contacts, and seeking medical treatment promptly if they are unwell.

"All suspected measles cases will be isolated."

The 1st case involved a worker at Toh Guan Dormitory who developed symptoms on 31 May 2019. He was later admitted to hospital on 3 Jun 2019 and tested positive for measles on 6 Jun 2019. He has since been discharged.

On 16 Jun 2019, the worker's roommate also developed symptoms and sought outpatient treatment. He was isolated at the dormitory's sick bay and tested positive for measles on 20 Jun 2019.

"As measles is contagious, such spread in close quarters is not unexpected," said the ministry spokesman.

Close contacts of the 2 workers, including roommates and co-workers, were later vaccinated against measles, MOH said.

Vaccination is mandatory for local children and foreign children applying for long-term Singapore passes.

Separately, 3 workers at Sungei Tengah Lodge were hospitalised and tested positive for measles between 20 and 21 Jun 2019.

MOH said investigations showed that the 3 workers stayed in different blocks at the dormitory and had no known contact with each other. They are also from different companies and had worked in different locations.

Two of the workers have since been discharged while the other is in stable condition.

As of [Wed 26 Jun 2019], 92 close contacts of the men have been identified and 91 have been vaccinated, MOH said. The remaining person will be vaccinated on Thu 27 Jun 2019, it added.

"As an added precaution, MOH is extending vaccination to all residents who stayed on the same floor as each of the 3 cases, given that residents living on the same floor at Sungei Tengah Lodge share toilet and bathroom facilities," the MOH spokesman said.

A spike in measles cases has been reported in Singapore this year [2019]. Last month [May 2019], Health Minister Gan Kim Yong told Parliament that there were 43 measles cases here in the 1st 4 months of this year, nearly 3 times the number seen during the same period last year [2018].

He said 33 of the 43 cases involved individuals who had not been vaccinated, ranging from infants to adults.

It is mandatory for local parents to vaccinate their children against measles and diphtheria. Those who fail to do so will receive reminders and those who refuse can be fined.

Since February this year [2019], foreign-born children applying for long-term immigration passes must also submit proof that they have received vaccination for measles and diphtheria.

ST understands that vaccination against measles is not a requirement for foreign adults entering Singapore, including foreign workers.

The Health Ministry's National Adult Immunisation Schedule, established in 2017, recommends measles vaccination to adults who have not been vaccinated or infected.

A ministry spokesman said: "In line with international practices, adult foreign nationals are recommended to be vaccinated against measles when entering Singapore. Individuals should seek advice from their doctor and discuss their vaccination needs."

[Interesting that the MoH does not consider the measles cases constitute an outbreak, yet there were apparently 2 independent sources of infection with these latest cases, and there have been 43 measles cases in Singapore in the 1st 4 months of this year. Nonetheless, the MoH is taking all the right steps to control the spread, vaccinating contacts. - Mod.LK

Date: Wed 26 Jun 2019

https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/global-measles-outbreak-arrives-kyrgyzstan-again/


Kyrgyzstan is witnessing a growing complacency towards measles, with some people believing that the vaccine is more dangerous than the disease itself.

This misconception has led to a significant decrease in immunisation coverage in the Central Asian state in recent years, especially among children under 12 months. And this growing number of unvaccinated children is translating into an overall decrease in collective immunity -- as well as an increase in measles cases.

In December 2017, Kyrgyzstan's Ministry of Health reported 2 measles cases from migrant workers returning to the country from Moscow, where they had contracted the virus. In January 2018, 13 more cases were registered in Bishkek, the capital, and the northern Chui region. The fact that measles - a disease which has a free and effective vaccine -- is experiencing such an uptick in Kyrgyzstan hints at the country's changing attitudes towards immunisation.

Both in Europe and globally in the last few years, measles has been making a comeback. In 2015, Kyrgyzstan saw its largest measles outbreak in recent memory when more than 17 000 people contracted the disease. These mostly younger people between the ages of 10 and 19 had not been vaccinated in connection with their parents' religious views. In response, the country implemented a nationwide vaccination campaign - with young people in Bishkek and Chui region as the principal target group.

Prior to 2018, this campaign seems to have been effective -- the number of registered measles cases dropped dramatically. However, this trend appears to have now been reversed once again.

Approaching the limit
---------------------
Despite Kyrgyzstan's relatively high overall immunisation rate, coverage has fallen over the past 5 years, dropping from 97.4% in 2013 to 95.5% in 2017 as a consequence of more parents refusing to vaccinate their children.

According to the World Health Organisation, the elimination of diseases such as measles requires "sustained immunisation coverage of at least 95% each year," and Kyrgyzstan is dangerously approaching this bottom line.

According to a UNICEF report for 2016-2017, the total number of vaccine refusals in the country has almost doubled in 2 years, from 4611 in 2016 to 7905 in 2017. This reveals a lack of public awareness about the composition of vaccines and the purpose of immunisation, as well as the dissemination of false and unverified data regarding Islam and its attitude to vaccination.

Since 2018, over 100 000 measles cases and 90 measles-related deaths were reported in the WHO's European region, which covers 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia, including Kyrgyzstan. The WHO reports a 300% increase in measles cases "in the 1st 3 months of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018" across the world. Further, many countries are "in the midst of sizeable measles outbreaks," including Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.

According to the WHO, between 2000 and 2016 period, the measles vaccine prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths.

Why the decreasing coverage?
----------------------------
Gulnara Jumagulova, deputy director of Kyrgyzstan's Republican Centre for Immunoprophylaxis at the Ministry of Health, told open Democracy that there were more than 1000 new cases of measles registered in the country in 2018, 80% of which were children under 5. Not only was this the highest number of new cases among Central Asian states, but it is due to rise: 1900 more cases were recorded in the first quarter of 2019.

"Measles outbreaks occur when the unvaccinated population group increases, so collective immunity against this infection decreases," explains Jumagulova. "The reason for this is the high number of refusals of preventive vaccinations, as well as the high level of internal and external migration."

The Republican Centre for Immunoprophylaxis has identified other reasons contributing to the decrease in coverage for measles and other vaccines.

These include a lack of access to healthcare in Kyrgyzstan's remote areas, as well as low levels of awareness among Kyrgyz society -- especially among people who have migrated inside the country -- about the need to vaccinate children.

However, according to the centre, the main reason for refusal is connected to unsubstantiated beliefs about "non-halal" vaccines containing pig blood, as well as a widespread misbelief that Islam prohibits Muslims from vaccinating. Between 2017 and 2018, the number of vaccine refusals in Kyrgyzstan due to purportedly religious views increased from 68.3% to 83.3%.

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-06-babies-overseas-measles-shot-months.html


This year [2019], we've seen a resurgence of measles around the globe. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recorded more than 230 000 cases in the 1st 5 months of 2019, compared to 160 000 in a similar period in 2018.

Australia has had 128 measles cases since the beginning of the year compared to a total of 103 cases for all of 2018.

Under Australia's National Immunisation Program, children receive 2 doses of MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine]. The 1st dose is given at 12 months of age and a 2nd dose at 18 months.

But given the rise of measles cases around the world, doctors are now calling for infants travelling overseas to be assessed by their GP to see whether they need the measles vaccine at 6 months.

Many adult Australians may not have received 2 doses of MMR vaccine, as only 1 dose was recommended before 1992 (a single dose is around 95% effective).

Unvaccinated travellers to countries with a higher prevalence of measles can unknowingly bring measles back to Australia. Current measles hot spots include Israel, Thailand, Viet Nam, Japan, Ukraine, Philippines, and the United States (especially New York).

Measles is highly infectious. Once imported from overseas, it's adept at seeking out and infecting the unvaccinated in a population.

The recent resurgence of measles has led experts to advise that people ensure they have had two lifetime doses of the MMR vaccine prior to travel.

As the 1st MMR vaccine is not given until 12 months of age, infant travellers who are too young to have received their 1st dose of MMR are particularly at risk of contracting measles.

We don't routinely recommend MMR immunisation for infants younger than 12 months because of the presence of maternal antibodies. During pregnancy, antibodies which protect against many diseases, such as measles, whooping cough, and influenza, are actively transferred through the placenta to the baby.

Most mothers have antibodies to protect against measles either from receiving the MMR vaccine themselves during childhood or adolescence, or as a result of prior infection.

But during the 1st year of life, the antibodies protecting the baby naturally wane. The antibody levels are usually high enough in the 1st 6 months of life to protect against measles.

Once an infant reaches 12 months of age, the measles antibodies have usually sufficiently disappeared and can no longer provide protection. For this reason, we give the 1st dose of MMR vaccine at 12 months old.

Maternal antibodies can interfere with and reduce the response to an MMR vaccine given to an infant before 12 months of age.

The WHO Expanded Program on Immunisation recommends the 1st dose of MMR vaccine be given at 9 months old. This is because in many countries the rates of measles are higher than in Australia, and the increased risk of infection outweighs any reduced vaccine response because of persisting maternal antibodies.

The WHO recommends that for countries like Australia that have achieved low rates of transmission, it's better to give the 1st MMR vaccine at 12 months, because higher protection occurs among older infants as there is less interference from maternal antibodies.

Until recently, our immunisation handbook stated that children as young as 9 months could receive the MMR vaccine in certain circumstances, including travel to highly measles-endemic areas and during outbreaks.

But given the rise in measles globally, the recommended age at which Australian infants can receive MMR vaccine in special circumstances has been lowered from 9 months-6 months.

The US and England also state vaccination from 6 months of age can occur for travellers and to help control outbreaks.

While MMR vaccines are normally free, because this early dose is not part of the National Immunisation Program, parents would have to pay around AUD 50 [about USD 35] to get it. Check with your local pharmacy.

Importantly, if MMR is given before 12 months old, infants still need 2 further doses of measles-containing vaccine. This is to account for the possibility the early dose may not have been completely effective because of interference from the maternal antibodies.

They should receive the next dose of MMR vaccine at 12 months of age or 4 weeks after the 1st dose -- whichever is later. They should then receive their final dose of measles-containing vaccine -- an MMR and varicella (chickenpox) combination, known as MMRV -- at 18 months. Both these vaccine doses are free under the National Immunisation Program.

A [2015] review* of MMR vaccines in infants under 9 months found the overall effectiveness was 72%. So it's not quite as effective as the near complete protection afforded by vaccination at 12 months and older, but still has a very strong chance of being effective.

MMR vaccine in infants from 6 months old was considered safe, with no reports of serious events recorded across 7 studies in the review. Fever and rash were the most common adverse reactions, occurring in 5-10% of infants. This is similar to vaccination at 12 months old.

Parents of young infants planning international travel should talk to their GP. The GP will consider factors including the length of the trip and destination countries when giving advice.

Adult travellers, too, should review their own vaccination record and speak to their GP if they are unsure they are fully protected.

[4] Ukraine: 53 000 cases this year with 18 deaths

The Eastern European nation [Ukraine] has recorded the world's highest increase in measles cases, with more than 100 000 detected since mid-2017. After years of declining vaccination rates, authorities are now aggressively immunizing children across the country. But adults are still at risk, and they comprise half of the country's measles cases and deaths. According to Ukraine's Health Ministry, officials have already detected 53 000 cases -- and 18 deaths -- this year [2019].

Is this an isolated problem? An epidemiologist in Washington state said the recent outbreak there has been traced back to a visitor from Ukraine.

https://brooklyneagle.com/articles/2019/06/25/williamsburg-school-ignited-nyc-measles-crisis/

A single school's decision to allow an unvaccinated child to attend class led to more than 40 measles cases and the eventual proliferation of the disease across New York City, a top health official said on Mon [24 Jun 2019].

Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Health, revealed at a conference hosted by NYU Langone that Yeshiva Kehilath Yakov Pupa in Williamsburg was the catalyst for what would become the worst outbreak in decades -- with 609 confirmed cases as of [Mon 24 Jun 2019].

"One school failed to exclude people in Williamsburg," Daskalakis said. "We had one measles case in that school, and subsequently every unvaccinated child who was not excluded came down with the measles, creating really the spark that ignited Williamsburg and created a true fire of measles in that neighborhood."

The infected child had the disease but had not yet begun showing symptoms when he showed up for class at the yeshiva, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish private school, in late January [2019].

The school did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The outbreak began spreading in the fall of 2018, when Health Department officials announced that 6 Brooklyn children had contracted the disease.

The initial Brooklyn case was acquired by a child on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak was taking place.

The epidemic has been contained mostly to the Orthodox Jewish communities of Williamsburg and Borough Park, with more than a dozen confirmed cases also in Sunset Park among the Latino population.

Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency on [9 Apr 2019] requiring mandatory measles-mumps-rubella vaccinations for residents who live in 4 northern Brooklyn ZIP codes.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill on [13 Jun 2019] banning any non-medical exemption to vaccinations, including religious exemptions.

The outbreak has cost the city roughly USD 2 million, according to Daskalakis.

He said that despite their greatest efforts to send out exclusion letters, monitor schools and audit them, the disease has still led to dire consequences, including 50 hospitalizations and 18 ICU visits.

Although the disease is primarily affecting the Orthodox Jewish community, Daskalakis wanted to break the myth that the general Orthodox Jewish community is resistant to vaccines. "It's not true," he said, citing the fact that after the outbreak was announced, vaccination rates in Williamsburg rose from around 70 percent to about 92 percent.

Health Commissioner Dr Oxiris Barbot, who attended Monday's [24 Jun 2019] conference, made it clear that there is not a problem with the city's approach to vaccines, revealing that 99 percent of school-age children are vaccinated -- the highest percentage in the country.

That percentage translates to roughly 1 million students, more than the populations of San Francisco and Boston.

"We don't have a problem with our vaccination system," she said. "We are very rigorous in the way in which we ensure that our school-age population is immunized.

"What we have a challenge with is there are pockets of our community that have been infiltrated with misinformation and, through inertia, that community has not been engaged enough."

America's measles outbreak continues to grow.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on [Mon 24 Jun 2019] reported 1077 measles cases in 28 states this year through 20 Jun 2019, up 33 from the last update.

This is the greatest number of cases reported in the US since 1992. Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000.

"These outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring," the CDC said.

Outbreaks spread further among pockets of unvaccinated people.

New York, one of the states with an outbreak, responded this month [June 2019] by eliminating the religious exemption for mandatory vaccinations.

Of the 599 autochthonous cases confirmed in [South America] in 2019, 55.40% corresponds to [Venezuela]. There is a downward trend of the epidemic related to the National Expanded Program on Immunization, however, the measures have been insufficient. In 12 federal entities, cases were confirmed during the 1st 23 weeks of 2019.

Since epidemiological week 21 of 2018 [week of 20 May 2018] the measles epidemic showed a continuous tendency to decline, but in the 1st 23 weeks of 2019 there was again evidence of a rise in the viral disease.

The information was released by the Venezuelan Society of Public Health, through its 27th measles alert in Venezuela, in which they say that "measles cases are increasing again due to intense outbreaks in Zulia and Anzoategui."

The alert details that so far this year [2019] 599 cases of measles in the south of the American continent have been confirmed. And of those cases, 332 correspond to Venezuela, representing 55.40%, followed by Colombia with 125 cases, (20.86%), and Brazil, which fell to 3rd place with 122 cases (20.36%).

Both states suffer a serious deterioration of public services that makes control operations more difficult, such as the lack of electricity needed to cool the vaccine, transportation and fuel to reach the communities, and communications and information," they explain in the report.

The Defender of the National Epidemiology network, responsible for carrying out the alert, explains that "mass vaccination of the population has allowed a substantial reduction of cases. However, confirmed cases have been reported in 12 federal entities in the 1st 23 weeks of 2019, indicating the operational difficulties for the effective implementation of the National Expanded Program on Immunization product of failures in basic services, electricity, transportation, fuel, and communications that the country suffers."

The protection of the susceptible population in a homogeneous way in all the municipalities of the country is the desirable thing -- according to the experts in the matter -- but this is still to be achieved, especially in the border municipalities, with population dispersed and difficult to access.

Confirmed cases reported between EW 1 and EW 23 of 2019 [1 Jan-8 Jun 2019] were reported in 12 federal entities: Aragua (1 case), Amazonas (1 case), Anzoategui (147 cases, 60 more); Bolivar (1 case), Carabobo (9 cases), Cojedes (2 cases), Delta Amacuro (1 case), Capital District (7 cases), Miranda (3 cases), Monagas (8 cases), Zulia (143 cases, 59 more), Yaracuy (2 cases) and Sucre (2 cases)," as indicated in the report.

The 290 cases confirmed from Anzoategui and Zulia evidence, in the opinion of the makers of the alert, an intense epidemic outbreak equivalent to 87.34% of the total cases confirmed in 2019, that is 332 (55.40%) of the total number of confirmed cases in South America.

[8] Costa Rica: imported cases

https://qz.com/1652132/fear-of-vaccines-are-causing-a-rise-in-measles-deaths-in-europe/


In February this year [2019], a holiday in paradise turned into a nightmare for one French family. Soon after their arrival in Costa Rica, their unvaccinated 5-year-old son developed measles, the country's 1st case since 2014.

The parents, also unvaccinated, tested positive for the virus too. They were believed to have brought it from France.

The family were swiftly quarantined, and the Costa Rican authorities contacted people at risk. A few weeks later, 2 American children -- again, unvaccinated -- also developed measles in the country. Again, the authorities had to act quickly to contain it.

When last measured in 2017, Costa Rica had a vaccination rate of 96% for the disease -- a clear sign that its people shouldn't have been at risk from each other. That same year, France's measles coverage stood at only 90%.

This isn't surprising in light of the widespread concern about childhood vaccines in France. One in 3 French people think vaccines are unsafe -- the world's highest rate -- and nearly 1 in 5 believe they aren't effective -- 2nd only to Liberia. This is according to new data from the Wellcome Global Monitor, a worldwide poll of more than 140 000 people in 144 countries.

At least 5 children have been reported to have died in Wau due to outbreak of measles at the protection of civilians' sites in the town.

According to health partners, the disease started since the beginning of June [2019], killing 5 children at the UN protection sites and continues spreading to other collective, including the Wau Cathedral Church site and Masana Biir, where the displaced people are sheltering.

"Despite efforts from the health partners that are doing a lot in Wau, there are still reports of cases on daily bases though there are no more death cases," Easter Moja, IOM [International Organization for Migration] clinical officer operating at Wau Cathedral Church told Gurtong.

"The case started with 5 children who have died. We suspected they were caused by measles and we intervened. The 5 cases are from the new arrivals. For those who come from Jur River county, most of them actually died from measles," said Easter.

"We have up to now received 69 cases from all sites including the UN protection sites and other collective areas. We have recorded the current line; we have listed some 385 cases starting from the end of May to 25 Jun 2019]. Most of the cases are from 6 months up to 5 years," she said.

Easter said that the health partners on the ground are scaling up strong preventive measures to control the spread as IOM and Jonathan organizations have been doing a massive campaign in the region.

"We are trying to control the disease because, as I said, in the beginning, we have started with the campaign of measles reactive to the outbreak, then we are also managing, we are isolating the cases, the cases are reducing; it is not like in the beginning. In the beginning it was actually in huge numbers, the death records was on daily bases but currently we are receiving the cases but actually the casualties have been minimized," she added.
