Last Wednesday the Argentinian Government reported a new outbreak of
foot and mouth disease after confirming it next to the property where
an outbreak was detected 3 weeks ago.
Argentina, which exports the 3rd largest amount of meat worldwide,
confirmed 3 weeks ago that 70 cattle from Corrientes, 25 kilometers
away from the Paraguay border, had foot and mouth disease.
A spokesman for National Service for Agro-Alimentary Safety (SENASA)
told Reuters, "The disease was detected in a single animal. All the
other animals tested were reported negative. The aforementioned
animal and all animals in contact with it were sacrificed in
February, when suspicions arose".
The spokesman told Reuters that according to International Office for
Animal Health (OIE), this new case is considered a new outbreak,
since it comes from a different herd. This animal under suspicion
since being reported on 22 Feb 2006, has now been confirmed as having
FMD.
Originally the case was not considered an outbreak since it was found
within a perifocal area within 3 km of the initial case -- but, after
reviewing OIE documents, the authorities have declared this a new
outbreak.
To date, 19 countries are restricting the import of Argentinian
bovine meat products, including Russia and Chile, which are the main
buyers. Many of the nations involved have banned only meat products
from Corrientes. In 2005, Argentina exported 596 014 tons of bovine
meat products, with an estimated value of USD 1.39 million.
