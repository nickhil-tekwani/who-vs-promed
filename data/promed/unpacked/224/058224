Israel is fighting the spread of bird flu.

A spokeswoman for the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture confirmed that there was an outbreak in battery cages near the village of Margaliot in the north of the country on the border with Lebanon.

320 000 laying hens would therefore have to be killed, in addition to 244 000 hens that had already been killed a week ago.

Mass deaths had also previously been observed in other laying batteries in Israel.

"The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned that people could be infected by infected battery cells near homes," said a statement.

It is now expected that there will be a shortage of eggs on the Israeli market -- around 14 million eggs are missing every month due to bird flu.

The outbreak in Israel could have consequences for other regions.

According to media reports, about 20% of the cranes that come to Israel as migrating birds from southern Europe to stop there on their way to Africa are also affected by the disease.

[2] Cranes, mass mortality, Hula Lake Reserve
Date: Sun 26 Dec 2021

Some 5000 dead cranes were counted Sunday [26 Dec 2021] at the Hula Lake Reserve in northern Israel, amid an outbreak of avian flu that has also seen the culling of more than half a million chickens and turkeys.

The Hula Lake is the main gathering point for tens of thousands of wild birds that migrate through Israel twice yearly.

Nature authorities provide food there, to keep the birds away from farmers' crops.

Feeding is continuing since the outbreak of the H5N1 virus at the lake, and in chicken sheds at Moshav Margaliot on the Lebanese border, to try to keep the cranes from flying elsewhere and taking the virus with them.

During a tour of the area on Sunday [26 Dec 2021] by staff of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority [INPA] and KKL-JNF Jewish National Fund, accompanied by Environmental Protection Minister Tamar Zandberg, another 250 dead cranes were seen in the Hula Valley outside of the reserve, and a further 30 were documented elsewhere, mainly in the Jezreel Valley.

A pelican with bird flu was reported in the Hefer Valley in central Israel and samples were being taken from dead birds at Kfar Ruppin in the Beit She'an Valley.

The INPA believes that the disease spread from Moshav Margaliot, via a truck driver who delivered food to the chicken coops there and then brought food to the Hula Reserve. A spokeswoman said there had never been such an avian flu outbreak among wild birds.

The Agriculture Ministry has said that the farmers on the moshav failed to report the outbreak in real time, allowing it to spread like wildfire.

The Hula Reserve will remain closed to the public until [1 Jan 2021].

Members of the public are advised to cook eggs and poultry meat thoroughly before eating, to avoid contact with wild birds or their excrement, and to call the INPA on *3639 if they see any signs of sick or dead birds.

[3] Table egg supply, public health concerns

The Haaretz daily published today (26 Dec 2021) a headline announcing apprehension that eggs from birds infected with bird flu had reached IDF [Israel's army] bases. As is well known, the [named] farm in Moshav Margaliot supplies the IDF with eggs from its laying farms. The outbreak of bird flu in Moshav Margaliot spread from the center of the moshav [cooperative village] to the egg-laying enterprise of the said firm next to the moshav, and now it is feared that eggs from an infected farm have reached the table of IDF soldiers.

What is the risk?
Avian influenza viruses, defined as pathogenic, can contaminate the contents of the egg in addition to external contamination of the shell. Therefore, these eggs have the potential for spreading infection (scientific references attached).

At the same time, it is reported that the Ministry of Agriculture has approved egg imports (14 million) for fear of shortage. It must be noted that this import measure was approved even before the outbreak of bird flu in Moshav Margaliot. The Poultry Industry Council recommends approving imports amounting to 70 million eggs.

There aren't many import options since most European countries are also infected with bird flu (except Spain), including Ukraine (early December 2021, outbreak in a poultry farm in the Kherson oblast).

[According to an update in Poultrymed, 26 Dec 2021, 2 additional HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry (turkey farms) have recently been identified by the State Veterinary Services. One, in Ein-Hachoresh, central Israel (19-week-old turkeys); the other one, in the Givat Yoav moshav, on the Golan Heights. This outbreak is situated about 2 km [1.2 mi] as the crow flies from an earlier outbreak, reported last week in Neot Golan, which similarly kept 13.6-week-old turkeys. Both are about 35 km [21.7 mi] distant, on their north northeast, from the Hula Lake reserve (crane outbreak) and 48 km [29.8 km] from Margaliot (map at <tinyurl.com/2e2z6phj>).

The epidemiological aspects of this unusual event are yet to be studied at depth, preferably incorporating animal health, public health, environmental, ornithology and farming experts. Among the issues to be investigated are the route of the pathogen's initial introduction to the region, its timeline, in particular poultry-infecting-wildlife or vice versa route(s), and the impact of wildlife (feeding) and poultry (small, numerous, dense coops) managements upon the disastrous disease/mortality both in cranes and on farms, respectively. The conclusions and recommendations of such inquiry are of significance, not only for the farming industry and environmentalists but for the public at large.

Since the start of the current HPAI H5N1 panzootic, in September 2021, vast regions in Europe and Asia have been affected; fortunately, not a single human case has, so far, been reported. - Mod.AS
