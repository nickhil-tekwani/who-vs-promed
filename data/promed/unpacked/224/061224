2 more cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV, have been confirmed in Abu Dhabi.

The 2 affected patients are a Jordanian husband and wife, state news agency Wam said. The 1st patient, a man, 38, was found to have MERS-CoV after being admitted to the ICU of a local hospital after complaining of respiratory symptoms. His wife, who is 8 months pregnant, was later diagnosed and is also being treated in the ICU. The Health Authority Abu Dhabi confirmed it is coordinating with the Ministry of Health and other authorities in the country to deal with the issue.

According to an update from the World Health Organisation (WHO) on [22 Nov 2013], "of the 176 laboratory-confirmed and probable reported cases to date, 69 have died."

"The MoH also confirmed that the situation does not call for concern and that it is being monitored closely to ensure the health and safety of everyone," said the Wam agency.

[According to a machine translation of an Arabic language newswire, the affected individuals are residents of Abu Dhabi (http://tinyurl.com/kuwl328). What is not mentioned is whether there was a history of travel elsewhere in the region during the incubation period, or if there was a history of exposure to animals during the incubation period.

At present the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection maintained by WHO (see [2] below) is 160 cases including 68 deaths. If the above mentioned 2 cases are officially confirmed, this will raise the global total to 162 cases.

These cases raise the number of MERS-CoV infections in the UAE to 10.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 29 Nov 2013
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [27 Nov 2013], the National IHR Focal Point of Qatar notified WHO that the Supreme Council for Health and the Ministry of Environment, in collaboration with the National Institute of Public Health and Environment (RIVM) of the Ministry of Health and the Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands, have detected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a herd of camels in a barn linked to 2 confirmed human infections (see DONs dated [18 Oct 2013 and 29 Oct 2013]; [the Disease Outbreak News reports can be found at http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_10_18/en/index.html and http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_10_29a/en/index.html respectively]).

Qatar investigation findings
----------------------------
Following the detection of 2 human cases infected with MERS-CoV, Qatar authorities (Public Health Department and the Department of Animal Resources) conducted a comprehensive epidemiological investigation into potential sources of exposure of human cases, with the support of an international team constituted by WHO and FAO.

Laboratory investigations at RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center have confirmed the presence of MERS-COV in 3 camels in a herd of 14 animals with which both human cases had contact. As a precautionary measure, the 14 camels on the farm have been isolated. All camels were asymptomatic or with mild symptoms when samples were taken and remained so during the following 40 days. All contacts of the 2 confirmed human cases, as well as the other worker employed in this barn, have been screened and laboratory tests were all negative for MERS-CoV.

These results demonstrate that camels can be infected with MERS-CoV, but there is insufficient information to indicate the role camels and other animals may be playing in the possible transmission of the virus, including to and from humans. The Supreme Council of Health is working with the RIVM and the Erasmus Medical Center to test additional samples from other animal species and from the environment of the barn. In addition, the Public Health Department and the Department of Animal Resources are conducting further studies at the national level to investigate the infection risk among individuals in close contact with animals.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO is working with the Qatari authorities to further review these findings and to develop additional guidance as necessary.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 160 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 68 deaths.

WHO MERS-CoV guidance to countries
----------------------------------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[The above mentioned WHO report provides details on the joint investigation involving the Qatar Public Health Department and the Department of Animal Resources in collaboration with WHO and FAO and the RIVM and Erasmus Medical Center in the Netherlands. Prior ProMED-mail reports have discussed the animal health issues and interpretations by OIE (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (93): animal res., camel conf, Qatar (RY) OIE 20131129.2082115, and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (92): animal reservoir, camel susp, Qatar, RFI 20131128.2080449).

Questions that come to mind include whether the viruses involved in the camel infection are the same genetically as the viruses involved in the human infections. And if found to be genetically similar, did the camels transmit the virus to the humans, or did the humans transmit the virus to the camels?

Approximately 2.5 weeks ago, ProMED-mail posted a report from Dr. Ziad Memish of the Saudi MOH on the identification of MERS-CoV in a camel known to have had contact with a human case of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia through PCR testing (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (85): animal reservoir, camel, susp, official 20131112.2051424). At that time, mention was made that further testing was ongoing to sequence the viruses identified in the patient and the camel to address the issue of genetic similarity. Results of these investigations/studies are awaited.

The role of contact with infected animals has been speculated as a potential source of infection with MERS-CoV. A caution is that many of the laboratory-confirmed infections do not have a known history of contact with animals during the incubation period prior to onset of illness, nor do they have a history of known contact with other laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in humans. Some questions that require addressing include: Is there another route for the species jump from bats to humans? Is there more subclinical transmission (asymptomatic infections in humans) than previously thought? - Mod.MPP]
