The National Health Surveillance Agency [Anvisa] reported this week the 3rd outbreak of _Candida auris_ in Brazil. The 2 cases occurred in a hospital in Pernambuco (PE). Isolates were obtained from urine samples from a 38-year-old male patient and of a female patient, 70 years old, admitted to a hospital in Pernambuco. On [11 Jan 2022], Anvisa was notified of the confirmation of the 1st case and on [12 Jan 2022] the 2nd case was confirmed.

[Brazilian media had reported the first possible _Candida auris_ case in a man hospitalized with COVID-19 in Bahia state on 9 Dec 2020 (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/brazil-reports-1st-possible-candida-auris-case-in-bahia-24428/).]

The identifications were confirmed by the reference laboratory -- the Central Public Health Laboratory.

- Since the identification of the suspected cases, the hospital has established precautionary measures and taken actions to prevent and control the outbreak.
- The Pernambuco State Infection Prevention and Control Coordination was notified about the suspected case, carried out a technical visit to the hospital and is providing guidance, monitoring the outbreak and supporting infection prevention and control actions.
- The national task force was activated and several surveillance, monitoring, prevention and control actions were intensified.
- The epidemiological investigation is already being organized and will be conducted by the Centers for Strategic Information on Health Surveillance (Cievs) and by the Epi SUS (Epidemiology Applied to the services of the Unified Health System - SUS).
- CGLAB is monitoring and supporting the laboratory investigation of the outbreak.
- The reference laboratories -- Lacens from Pernambuco and Bahia are supporting the analysis of samples sent by the hospital laboratory.
- The L emi from EPM/Unifesp is already preparing for the sequencing of the isolates.
- Anvisa is monitoring the actions related to the outbreak, articulating with those involved and supporting the actions of the national task force.

[_Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant pathogen that causes healthcare-associated infections, associated with high mortality. _C. auris_ has the ability to persistently colonize environmental surfaces, and epidemiologic investigations of hospital outbreaks find widespread _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms, and surfaces that were frequently touched, such as computer screens, touchpads and keyboards.

Screening cultures of patients at multiple sites (e.g., axilla, groin, rectum) in nosocomial outbreak settings commonly find asymptomatic colonization. Colonized or infected patients frequently have prior extensive contact with multiple healthcare facilities, highlighting the value of careful and thorough communication at inter-healthcare facility transfers. Investigations of the causes of hospital outbreaks frequently find infection control lapses, undoubtedly compounded by the care required for critically ill ICU patients.

Whole genome sequencing has identified 4 distinct clades that segregate geographically to South Asia (India and Pakistan), South Africa, Venezuela, and Japan with minimal observed intraregion genetic diversity. Genotypes of isolates in the USA have been highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the USA followed by local transmission within healthcare settings.

_C. auris_ can be misidentified by laboratories and often is resistant to multiple antifungal medications. _C. auris_ isolates are usually resistant to fluconazole, and many are also resistant to amphotericin B. Because isolates are uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), echinocandins remain the initial empiric drugs of choice for infections caused by this pathogen, but _C. auris_ can emerge echinocandin-resistant on therapy.

More information on the outbreak in the Pernambuco hospital would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Pernambuco (estimated pop. 9.6 million in 2020) is a state, located in northeast Brazil; Recife is the capital and largest city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pernambuco).
