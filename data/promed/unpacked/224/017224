Massachusetts health officials confirm a 2nd death from mosquito-borne eastern equine encephalitis [EEE virus infection] and a new case that brings the summer's total to 7.

The new EEE case is a Plymouth County boy under 18 who is recovering.

The family of the 63-year-woman of Amesbury told The Daily News of Newburyport (http://bit.ly/SNQ9q7) she died Saturday [22 Sep 2012] of complications from EEE [virus infection]. Family members said she may have had weakened immunity from past cancer treatment. Officials have said a Westborough man in his 70s died earlier from EEE [virus infection].

[A large part of the east coast of the USA, including coastal Massachusetts, is endemic for EEE virus. Although a vaccine is available for equine animals, there is no commercially available vaccine for human use. Although EEEV human infections are relatively rare, they can be serious and even fatal, as illustrated by the unfortunate people who died as reported above. Residents in this area should follow the advice of state health authorities and avoid mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
