Since rabid fox attacks on pet animals and livestock began in January, over
25 cases have been recorded in the town of Henniker, New Hampshire, with 10
fox carcasses recovered. According to Police Chief Timothy Russell, speaking
of the rabid wildlife, "They are in town. Outside town. All over the place."
Strict quarantine rules have been instituted for animals that have been
bitten. No human cases have occurred.
