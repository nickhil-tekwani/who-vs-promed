Since this Tuesday, 08 [Jul 2008], staff of the Institute Evandro
Chagas and the state Secretariat of Surveillance and Health have
been carrying out a serological survey of non-human primates in the
Cia region of Simoes Filho, to check for circulation of [yellow]
fever [YF] virus in monkeys. The Secretariat of Health confirmed the
presence of sylvan type YF virus in a monkey that was found dead on
this spot in January this year [2008]. The information was only
disclosed this Wednesday 09 [Jul 2008], in a press release.

Despite the record in that region of the Atlantic Forest -- an area
which has never had reported cases of the disease in primates -- the
superintendent of Surveillance and Protection of Health Care in the
State, Lorene Louise Pinto, assures that there is no reason to panic
among the population and indicated that the region is not considered
at risk due to this episode, but must be monitored from the point of
view of prevention in order to avoid human [YF virus] infections.

All those living in a radius of 500 meters [547 yards] of where the
monkey was found dead and were not yet immunized were vaccinated by
health workers. Residents also were included in the serological survey.

The director of Surveillance, Alcina Andrade, stated that there is
ample [vaccinaion] coverage to prevent the disease in the state,
which has not had sylvan [YF] cases since 8 years ago. The latest YF
cases recorded in Bahia were in December 2000 when sylvan YF cases
occurred in the extreme west [of the state], in the municipalities of
Coribe and Jaborandi. In Brazil, there have been no reports of the
urban form of the disease since 1942.

Because of the cases in Coribe and Jaborandi, vaccination in Bahia
has been intensified. In El Salvador, even, there has been ample
coverage by [health] posts that offer the vaccine against the disease.

Insect [mosquito vectors] collected in the Cia region of Simoes Filho
have been negative [for YF virus], according to the state
Superintendent of Surveillance and Health, Lorene Louise Pinto.

Questioned about the fact that the [monkey] death had occurred in
January [2008] and the results of the laboratory tests have been
released only in the month of May, the Superintendent reported that
the tests were done in Para, in the Instituto Evando Chagas, and that
Bahia had, as with other states, to await the outcome of the
laboratory tests. "The Bahia results took time and [Bahia] did not
have priority because there were no [human] cases," he explained.

[The concern is that, Simoes Filho, a municipality of the state of
Bahia, in 2005 had an estimated population of 107 561 inhabitants, is
located beside Salvador, has now become joined with the Bahian
capital. It is near, very near the capital (see Wikipedia
<http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B5es_Filho>. - Mod.LJS]

[The concern is that the presence of sylvan YF virus so close to a
major population center that has been experiencing a significant
dengue outbreak, with abundant YF virus competent vectors, could lead
to an urban YF transmission cycle, as occurred earlier this year
(2008) in Paraguay. If YF vaccination coverage is, in fact, adequate
to prevent YF virus transmssion, then that risk is low. - Mod.TY]
