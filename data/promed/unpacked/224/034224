The Wayne County Public Health Department has received notification from the NYS Department of Health (NYSDOH) that a 4th horse has tested positive for EEE (eastern equine encephalitis). This horse was located in the town of Galen. The NYSDOH is planning to conduct testing of mosquito pools in this area.

In response to NYS Department of Health Acting Commissioner Dr Zucker making a declaration of an Imminent Threat to Public Health for mosquito-borne disease, the Wayne County Board of Supervisors has authorized aerial spraying for mosquitoes in the affected areas. In accordance with the New York State regulations and the New York State Mosquito-borne Illness Surveillance & Response Plan, spraying is part of an effective surveillance and control system. Aerial spraying is a control measure to diminish mosquito populations which will help to reduce the risk of human infection from the EEE virus.

Wayne County Public Health Director Diane Devlin emphasizes that people in Wayne County need to continue to use personal protective measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. The County will conduct aerial spraying on the evening of Thu 25 Sep 2014 from 6 p.m. till dark.

The product Masterline Kontrol 30-30, which contains permethrin, will be applied in a diluted form. The County has contracted with Duflo Spray-Chemical to conduct the aerial spraying. The procedure is approved by the State Health Department and the Department of Environmental Conservation.

The area to be sprayed has been decreased from 7600 acres [3075 ha] to 1325 acres [536 ha], which includes mostly swampland and wooded areas. [A map of the area showing the boundary areas to be sprayed may be found at the source URL above]. Residents living within the aerial spraying boundaries will be notified 24 hours prior to spraying by the Public Health Department. People in the target area should stay indoors and keep windows and doors closed for 1 hour after spraying. They are also advised to:
- keep pets indoors;
- close the vents on window air conditioners so that outside air doesn't enter the home for 1 hour;
- remove outdoor toys, outdoor furniture, and clothing from the clothesline. Items left outdoors should be washed thoroughly with soap and water before using;
- if you are driving through an area while spraying takes place, close your car windows and vents;
- cover gardens, or rinse homegrown fruits and vegetables thoroughly before cooking or eating.

A copy of the pesticide label and MSDS including all warnings and fact sheets about permethrin aerial spraying can be found on the Wayne County website at http://www.co.wayne.ny.us or obtained by calling the Wayne County Health Department weekdays between 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.

For more information on pesticide regulation, contact the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Bureau of Pest Management, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233.

Ohio officials have reported that 4 horses from Ashtabula and Trumbull counties have died after contracting eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care; fatality rates reach 75-80 percent among horses. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems.

Vaccinating horses against EEE coupled with mosquito control are the most important ways to minimize an animal's chances of becoming infected. In the northern regions of the United States, most veterinarians recommend vaccinating horses in the spring prior to peak mosquito levels. In the south, where mosquito populations are present year-round, veterinarians might recommend more frequent vaccination.

Mosquito management is vital in the prevention of EEE and other vector-borne viruses that cause illness in humans and in horses. Additionally, minimizing mosquito populations near your horses by eliminating mosquito breeding and resting areas will reduce the chances these insects bite and infect horses and the people who care for them.

For example, reduce or eliminate sources of stagnant or standing water, remove muck from areas near the horses, stable horses during peak mosquito periods (that is, dawn and dusk), use equine-approved mosquito repellants, place fans inside barns or stalls to maintain air movement, keep weeds and grass trimmed, and avoid using incandescent bulbs inside stables at night. Instead, place incandescent bulbs away from the stables to attract mosquitoes to areas away from horses.

These are 2 different states and 2 very different responses to the same situation. While spraying to control mosquitoes is never wrong, it is just a sad commentary that they appear to allow the horse to be a sentinel animal. Most areas use a few chickens as sentinel animals, and are more proactive about their spraying. Furthermore, it seems there should be some encouragement for horse owners to vaccinate their horses, to spray them with horse-approved mosquito and fly control sprays. While NY has had a substantial amount of rain this spring and summer (2014), it still seems it would have been appropriate to advice horse owners to vaccinate and for humans to protect themselves with mosquito repellent.

Then there is the OH response that combines vaccination, and spraying, as well as eliminating water where mosquitoes breed.

Either approach should be effective for controlling mosquitoes, but with vaccination animals have a better chance of survival. Vaccination must be done properly and timely. - Mod.TG]
