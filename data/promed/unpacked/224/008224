According to the General Consulate of the Kyrgyz republic in Alma-Ati, on 4
Sep 2005 a poisoning case was reported in the village of Otegen Batir,
Alma-Ati region. The victims were citizens of the Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz
republics. During the meeting of officials from the General consulate and
law-enforcement forces, it was revealed that, on 4 Sep 2005, several people
were admitted to the hospital and one of them had died at the hospital. It
happened at the rayon [district] hospital of Otegen Batir village.
Presently, the police are conducting an investigation of the food product
(Rolton noodles) consumed by the victims as well as the dishes that were
used for serving. The chief physician of the rayon hospital has said that
the poisoning occurred because one of the victims, a citizen of Kazakhstan,
had added sodium nitrite to the food instead of salt.

[In 1997, not far from Bishkek, the capital of the Kyrgyz republic, there
was a mass poisoning with sodium nitrite involving 54 people, of which 2
died. These people were drivers of long distance trucks who had eaten plov
(a dish very common in Russia and the former Soviet states made with lamb,
rice, carrots, onions and lots of cooking oil, occasionally with added
cumin), and all were ill within 2 hours. The dish was prepared by one of
the drivers, who accidentally put sodium nitrite (a white fine-grained
powder that resembles salt) instead of salt into the food. - ProMED-mail

[Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the
spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes
botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word botulinum
comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which was responsible
for many deaths centuries ago before cured with nitrite. In addition to
serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite is used to produce the characteristic
flavor, texture, and pink color of cured meats.
At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in
hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin, which
does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood. Symptoms of
methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heart
rate), weakness and dizziness. As decreased oxygenation of tissues becomes
truly inadequate, dyspnea (shortness of breath), acidosis, arrhythmias
(irregular heart rhythms), coma, convulsions and even death may occur. -
