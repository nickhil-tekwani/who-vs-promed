Scientists at North Carolina (NC) State University (NCSU) have confirmed
the existence of a second species of _Pfiesteria_, a toxic microbe linked
to fish kills -- and, in some cases, to human health problems -- along the
mid-Atlantic coast.
Researchers from NC State's Aquatic Botany Laboratory presented their
findings, including a description of the new species, _Pfiesteria
shumwayae_, on Saturday (March 11) at the Southeastern Estuarine Research
Society (SEERS) conference in Wilmington, N.C.
Dr. JoAnn M. Burkholder, NC State professor of aquatic botany and marine
sciences, says _P. shumwayae_ is the second species identified from "the
toxic _Pfiesteria_ complex," a group of closely related dinoflagellate
marine organisms believed responsible for killing millions of fish from the
Chesapeake Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.
"As our knowledge of these organisms grows and improved techniques become
available to detect them, we'll probably identify a dozen separate
species," said Burkholder, the world's leading _Pfiesteria expert_. "We're
still just knocking on the door with this discovery." Burkholder
co-discovered the first Pfiesteria species, _Pfiesteria piscicida_, in
1989. "Piscicida" in Latin means "fish killer."
Research under Burkholder's direction at the NC State Aquatic Botany Lab
found that _P. shumwayae_ -- pronounced "shum-way-eye" -- is genetically
and structurally different from its better-known cousin, _P. piscicida_.
Additionally, the 2 species appear to respond somewhat differently to the
enrichment of nutrients, often overabundant in coastal waters: _P.
shumwayae_ appears to thrive best in waters with high levels of nitrogen,
while _P. piscicida_ seems to prefer increased phosphorus levels, although
both nitrogen and phosphorus can stimulate it to grow. Scientists first
detected _P. shumwayae_ -- which they suspected to be a new species --
during a 1995 fish kill in North Carolina's New River estuary, following a
major spill of effluent from a hog waste lagoon.
During 2 years of testing by Burkholder and associate Howard Glasgow Jr.'s
lab, and by an independent lab for careful corroboration, all the tests
confirmed the organism is toxic.
Researchers have discovered other Pfiesteria "lookalike" organisms, but _P.
shumwayae_ is the first truly _Pfiesteria_-like organism, other than _P.
piscicida_, to be found harmful to fish.
Burkholder said the life cycle and behavior of _P. shumwayae_ are identical
to those of _P. piscicida_. Like _P. piscicida_, the newly-described
species has a complex series of life stages, most of which are nontoxic.
"So far, we've confirmed that 19 of its stages are similar to those of _P.
piscicida_, and we believe it's only a matter of time before we verify that
the other stages are also the same," Burkholder said. Most of those stages
are nontoxic in both species. In the presence of live fish, however,
several stages of both species generate toxins that stun the fish and cause
open sores on their skin; the microbes then feed on the fish tissue and
blood.
Both species prefer to prey on the same kinds of algae when fish are not
available, and can "steal" plant-like organelles from algae to masquerade
as microscopic plants.
NC State researchers, however, found dissimilarities in the structure and
the genetic makeup of the 2 species. Molecular probes identified a 3
percent difference between the 2 species' DNA.
Glasgow spent 200 hours over 2 years mapping the surface of hundreds of
Pfiesteria zoospores using a scanning electron microscope. In doing so, he
found many specimens had a different "fingerprint" -- they had a 4-sided
structural plate on the outside of the cells where _P. piscicida_ had a
3-sided plate. "The difference between these species is the difference
between a diamond and a triangle," Burkholder explained.
Thus far, _P. shumwayae_ has been found to overlap the geographic
distribution of _P. piscicida_. The single-celled organisms inhabit the
brackish waters of estuaries from the Chesapeake Bay and Pamlico Sound
south to the Gulf Coast of Florida and Alabama.
Burkholder named the new species in honor of Dr. Sandra E. Shumway,
professor of biology and marine science at Southampton College in New York.
Dr. Shumway is a premier scientist studying harmful algal blooms," she
said. "She's done some of the most significant pioneering research on how
toxic algal blooms impact wild and cultured shellfish populations."
