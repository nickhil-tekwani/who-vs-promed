Salmonella Serotype Mbandaka: Oregon & Washington States
Public health officials have announced a recall of Hydro Harvest brand
alfalfa sprouts from retail outlets in Oregon and Washington States. The
recall includes all alfalfa sprouts produced since November 1998. The
sprouts are sold in 6-oz. plastic clamshell packages labeled "Living
Alfalfa Sprouts," "Living Salad Sprouts: Alfalfa/Radish/Clover," and
"Living Onion-Alfalfa Sprouts and have been distributed to supermarkets,
grocery stores, restaurants and other retail outlets. To date, there have
been 11 confirmed cases of Salmonella serotype Mbandaka in Oregon and 2
confirmed cases in Washington. This is the third sprout-associated outbreak
of salmonellosis in Oregon since 1996. Alfalfa sprouts have been
repeatedly linked to outbreaks of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 infections
in the United States and Canada; accordingly, alfalfa sprouts should be
considered a high risk food for salmonellosis.

Salmonella Serotype Baildon: United States
Since mid-December 1998, 67 cases of _S. baildon_ infection and 3
associated deaths have been reported to CDC. Infections have been reported
from California (33), Virginia (13), Arizona (12), Georgia (7) and
Tennessee (2). Onsets of illness dates have ranged from December 14 to
January 18, 1998, and ill persons range in age from 17 to 86 years. The 3
deaths occurred in elderly women: 2 were nursing home patients.
Preliminary analysis of case-control studies in Virginia and California
suggest that illness is associated with eating fresh produce items in
restaurants. Further data analysis and epidemiologic studies in other
states are on-going. _S. baildon_ is an uncommon serotype which can be
misidentified as other rare Salmonellae, such as _S. lomalinda_ if complete
serological testing is not performed.
