Mysterious poisoning kills 71 cattle; many still ill

MANGALORE: The villagers of Paduveri in Byndoor of Kundapur Taluk of Udupi District, mainly dependent on dairying and allied activities, have been in a state of shock.

Almost one third (approximately 30%) of their cattle heads have died like flies in the last 3 days and they are still counting. As on Saturday, the toll has reached 71.

The reason is said to be ingestion of chemical waste dumped at cattle grazing grounds at Ottinene. One owner, who had 20 head of cattle, has already lost 14 and some [other] are showing signs of poisoning, which is worrying him further. The village has about 40-45 families and each possess a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 35 head of cattle. So far, about 15 families have lost their entire stock to this mysterious poisoning incident.

Dr Nagaraj and Dr Babanna Poojari, veterinary officers from Byndoor and Hemmadi, who were at the site on Saturday told TOI that the cattle, which were dead/dying, are/were exhibiting signs of poisoning.

''We are administering symptomatic treatment as we don't know what exactly the poison is. We have conducted post mortem on a few cattle and send the viscera to the forensic laboratory at Mangalore. After our intervention and change of treatment every 2 hours for various type of poisoning like nitrate, arsenic and cyanide, we have been able to delay the onset of death to some extent, but not prevent it,'' he said. ''Only those cattle which were left for grazing at Ottinene grounds are showing these signs,'' said Dr Poojari.

Dr Nagaraj said the waste at Ottinene has been burnt using petrol by some miscreants after the news spread and they have not been able to identify the industrial chemical waste. ''We have found saloon waste, animal remains, blades, rubber, plastic etc at the site. At the moment anthrax and Hemorrhagic septicemia have been ruled out,'' he said.

[There are not clinical signs, other than acute death, given in this article.

Animals dying of nitrate intoxication generally have a chocolate colored blood, which is fairly distinctive, and treatment is specific and must be rapid.

The same is true for animals ingesting cyanide compounds. Treatment must be very rapid and very specific. The animal demonstrates a bright cherry red venous blood. It is distinctive.

So if either of these were the case, then it seems the vets would have been able to recognize that and hopefully the article would have told us of more improvement. Because these 2 toxins can be rapidly fatal it is imperative to have the proper treatment administered very rapidly when the animal begins to show clinical signs.

The article really does not give us much to access the situation by. The veterinarians admit they treated for arsenic poisoning. However, there are both inorganic and organic forms of arsenic and the treatment is not the same. So if they treated for one form and the arsenic is in the other form, then it may still be an arsenical.

Since the article states it was only in cattle left to graze a particular region, I do wonder if the area was treated with any arsenical weed killers. They can also kill cattle.

They do not tell us any of the details of the necropsy which might shed more light on this case.

If there is more information we would appreciate someone sharing with us.
