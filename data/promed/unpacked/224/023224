Equine viral arteritis, United Kingdom
--------------------------------------
Information received on 03 Aug 2010 from Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London,
United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date 10 Jun 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event 10 Jun 2010
Report date 02 Aug 2010
Date submitted to OIE 03 Aug 2010
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence January 2005
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Equine arteritis virus
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 (EVA 2010/01) Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, ENGLAND
Date of start of the outbreak 10 Jun 2010
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Species Equidae
Susceptible 8
Cases 1
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0
Affected Population: A beef and sheep farm with a mixed horse
enterprise. There are 3 brood mares, one stallion and 5 working show jumpers.

Epidemiology - Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection.
Unknown or inconclusive. Legal movement of animals.

Epidemiological comments: Following an unexplained antibody titer for
EVA disclosed by routine serology testing prior to entering an AI
stud. There is no record of EVA vaccination in the passport and the
stallion was investigated for the possible presence of EVA virus. The
horse is reported to have been purchased from Netherlands at the
beginning of this year.

Control measures - Measures applied. Quarantine; Disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); No vaccination; No treatment of
affected animals
Measures to be applied- No other measures.

Laboratory name and type: Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge

[It is not uncommon for subclinical infections to be identified as
was the case here. For detailed background information on EVA, see
Mod.TG's commentary in 20020209.3523. I have copied these comments
below. - Mod.PC]

[Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids
caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus that is
classified in the family Arteriviridae. The virus is found in horse
populations in many countries world-wide. EVA is included in the List
B of the OIE, which are diseases of economic significance which
should be reported annually from endemic countries, or as an
emergency notification when recognized for the first time in a
country; such is the current case in Argentina. The disease has been
reported to the OIE, in the past, from Europe, Africa, North America,
Australia and New Zealand, but not (yet?) from Asia and South
America. EVA cannot be differentiated clinically from a number of
other respiratory and systemic equine diseases. While
laboratory-confirmed outbreaks of EVA have been infrequently reported
in the past, the incidence of the disease appears to be on the increase.

Although many cases of EAV infection are subclinical, certain virus
strains can cause disease of varying severity characterized
principally by fever, depression, anorexia, dependent oedema,
especially of the limbs, scrotum and prepuce in the stallion,
conjunctivitis, an urticarial-type skin reaction, abortion and,
rarely, a fulminating pneumonia or pneumo-enteritis in young foals.
Apart from mortality in young foals, the case-fatality rate in
outbreaks of EVA is very low. Affected horses almost invariably make
complete clinical recoveries. A long-term carrier state can occur in
a high percentage of infected stallions, but not in mares or
nonbreeding horses.

There is considerable evidence that short- and long-term carrier
stallions shed EAV constantly in the semen but not in respiratory
secretions or urine. International movements of horses, as well as
their semen, is liable to testing and certification which are
specified in chapter 2.5.10.1 of the International Animal Health Code
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/A_00085.htm>.

According to OIE's Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and
Vaccines, stallions should first be serologically tested. Virus
isolation should be attempted from the semen of stallions that are
positive for antibodies to EVA and that do not have a satisfactory
history of vaccination against EVA. - Mod.AS]

[The 2 most important routes of transmission of the virus are
respiratory via the acutely infected horse and venereal via the acute
or chronically infected stallion. Aerosol transmission is the
principal means of spread of infection among horses closely
congregated such as at racetracks, shows, and sales. Venereal
transmission by an infected stallion is frequently responsible for
dissemination of the virus on breeding farms. Indirect spread of the
virus through contact with contaminated fomites (e.g., shanks,
twitches, apparel, and personnel) is of minor significance during
outbreaks. Congenital infection of foals due to exposure of mares
late in gestation has been infrequently recorded.

A significant percentage of stallions become carriers after exposure
to the virus. These stallions transmit the virus venereally and play
a major role in maintaining infection in horse populations from year
to year. Attempts to establish the carrier state in mares, geldings,
and sexually immature colts have been unsuccessful.

No specific antiviral treatment is available. Symptomatic treatment
(antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, and diuretics) is indicated. Good
nursing and rest with a gradual return to normal activity are
desirable. There is no known medical means of eliminating the carrier
state in the stallion.

EVA can be prevented and controlled by sound management practices and
selective use of a commercial, modified live virus vaccine. While the
vaccine is both safe and immunogenic for stallions and non pregnant
mares, it is not recommended for use in pregnant mares, or in foals
less than 6 weeks old. Prevention and control programs are aimed at
curtailing dissemination of the infection. This minimizes the risk of
virus-related abortions and helps prevent development of the carrier
state in stallions. - Mod.TG]
