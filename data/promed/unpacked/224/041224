Taiwan has reported the 1st case of whooping cough [pertussis] in 2 years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said on Wednesday [19 Oct 2022], as it encouraged parents to vaccinate their children against the potentially fatal disease.

A junior-high school student on Tuesday [18 Oct 2022] was diagnosed with whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection caused by bacteria, the CDC said in a news release. The teenager on 20 Sep [2022] developed a sore throat, a cough, fever, chest pain, and headache, which persisted after seeking medical attention, it said. He was admitted to hospital on 6 Oct [2022]. His condition was improving, and he was in a stable condition, the CDC added.

The boy had received 5 doses of the DTP-HB-Hib vaccine, also known as the 5-in-one vaccine, against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type B disease, it said.

One of the teenager's 4 other family members also developed a cough and was prescribed medication, it said, but added that it was unclear whether the person was also infected.

Local health authorities have traced 44 close contacts of the boy, none of whom have developed similar symptoms, the CDC said.

Pregnant women and people who babysit infants or young children should get one shot of the 5-in-one vaccine at their own expense to protect preschool-age children, who are at risk of severe symptoms when infected with the disease, it said.

Whooping cough can cause life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia and brain lesions, in children, especially those younger than 6 months [of age].

CDC data showed that Taiwan recorded 30 cases of whooping cough in 2018, 32 in 2019, and 5 in 2020. Among the cases, 57% were younger than 2 months or had received none or only one dose of the vaccine, while 20% were adults, the data showed.

Preschool-age children in Taiwan are eligible to receive 5 shots of the vaccine, with the 1st administered to children as young as 2 months [of age].

[Pertussis can be severe in infants under 12 months of age; about 1/3 in that age group require treatment in a hospital (https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/clinical/complications.html), with patients younger than 6 weeks accounting for the majority of the deaths (https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-021-06732-1).

Pertussis is a vaccine-preventable infection. Infants younger than 2 months of age who are too young to be protected by the childhood pertussis vaccine series can be protected if their mothers received Tdap while pregnant.

Maternal immunization with Tdap not only protects pregnant women but also their newborn children from pertussis because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination between the 27th and 36th week of pregnancy.

Taiwan currently recommends immunization against pertussis with DTaP-Hib-IPV at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age, and DTaP-IPV at 5 years of age (https://www.health.ntpc.gov.tw/en/basic/?mode=detail&node=11).

Starting in 2011, the Taiwan Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended the administration of Tdap to all women in the immediate postpartum period and to all family members for providing a protective cocoon of immunity around the newborn infant. In response to a persistent increase in neonatal pertussis, in August 2014, the Taiwan CDC issued a new recommendation that pregnant women receive a dose of Tdap between weeks 28 and 36 of gestation during each pregnancy (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1028455920300061). - Mod.ML
