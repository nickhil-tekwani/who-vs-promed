The diarrhea outbreak in the Barisal division has turned severe, with 8 deaths and thousands hospitalized across 6 districts. Currently, 18 of the 40 upazilas [formerly called thanas, administrative regions] under 6 districts of Barisal division are suffering from a diarrhea crisis.

Bhola faced the brunt of the crisis, with the district witnessing 8090 hospital admissions from the beginning of 2021 until Wednesday [21 Apr 2021]. The number was 4252 in the last month [March 2021] alone. Health officials of Barisal district have termed water pollution as the culprit behind this condition.

Dr Shyamal Krishna Mandal, assistant director of Barisal Divisional Health Office, said 2 investigation teams of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) had found _E. coli_ in the stool of diarrhea patients. _E. coli_ (_Escherichia coli_) bacteria [can cause] a cholera-like illness and acute diarrhea.

Meanwhile, as the situation is deteriorating drastically, the markets have run out of intravenous (IV) fluid stocks. The Dhaka Tribune has learned that medical services are being disrupted due to an insufficient supply of this crucial saline (IV drip) at the government level.

According to the Barisal Divisional Health Office, a total of 32 183 people have been affected by diarrhea in the last 3 months in 6 districts of the division. In the last one month, 17 672 people have been infected, and in the last week, an average of 1100 patients were admitted to hospitals every day. Now, more than 1500 patients have been admitted in a span of 24 hours.

The authorities at the 250-bed Bhola General Hospital are not able to provide seats, and patients have made beds on the floors; even the balconies are packed with patients. The guardians of the patients are falling ill due to the poor conditions. Many of the patients came to seek treatment from the hospital but returned home emptyhanded. Bhola Civil Surgeon Dr Syed Rezaul Islam said 74 teams had been dispatched to the field to battle the crisis.

Of the infected patients, 4 died in Bakerganj, 2 in Barguna, and 2 in Patuakhali in the last one week, the Divisional Health Office confirmed.

Barisal Divisional Health Director Dr Basudeb Kumar Das said that water pollution in the rivers had increased. As a result, the disease has been spreading rapidly, as it is mainly waterborne.

"Although diarrhea is a symptom of coronavirus, we are still not sure if it is due to COVID-19," he said.

Meanwhile, there is a demand for more than 100 000 saline packets in the 6 districts of Barisal division at the moment, but there are only a few thousand saline sachets in the hospital stocks. "The demand in our department has increased many folds," he said, adding, "A patient can often need up to 50 liters of IV fluids, so the gap between demand and supply is immense. This has led to a crisis."

[The isolation of _E coli_ from the stools of some of the patients is not unexpected, as the organism is normal flora in the colon. Some _E. coli_ belong to enteric pathotypes such as enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, and enterohemorrhagic, which require specific testing to identify them. Therefore, the etiology or etiologies of this large and persistent outbreak is unclear. ProMED would like additional microbiologic information.

Barishal Division (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barisal_Division) is one of the 8 administrative divisions of Bangladesh. Located in the south-central part of the country, it has an area of 13 644.85 km2 (5268.31 sq mi) and a population of 8 325 666 at the 2011 census. It is bounded by Dhaka Division on the north, the Bay of Bengal on the south, Chattogram Division on the east, and Khulna Division on the west. The administrative capital, Barisal city, lies in the Padma River delta on an offshoot of the Arial Khan River. Barisal division is crisscrossed by numerous rivers that earned it the nickname "Dhan-Nodi-Khal, Ei tine Borishal" (rice, river, and canal built Barisal).
