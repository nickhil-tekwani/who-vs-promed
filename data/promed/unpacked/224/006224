The 1st [human] case of the eastern equine encephalitis virus [EEEV] this year [2019] has been reported in Catawba County, North Carolina.

Eastern equine encephalitis is better known as "EEE." It is the 1st case reported in the Carolinas in 2019.

"EEE virus is a rare cause of brain infections. Only a few cases are reported in the United States each year," according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. "Most occur in eastern or Gulf Coast states. Approximately 30% of people with EEE die and many survivors have ongoing neurologic problems."

A map on the CDC's website confirms the case. [The map is for 2009-2018 as is the table of total cases in the USA https://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/tech/epi.html].

11 people have died nationwide this year [2019] after contracting EEE, according to the CDC.

Health officials have not confirmed the condition of the patient in Catawba County.

The CDC said the best way to prevent contracting EEE is to use insect-repellent as directed and use other standard mosquito-control steps. Symptoms of EEE include fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea, according to the CDC.

[EEE continues to cause human cases in North Carolina for the 1st time this year (2019). EEE cases are not new to the state historically. The CDC case map mentioned above reports 7 cases during the 2009-2018 time period. It is curious that the report above does not mention the risk that EEE virus infection poses for equine and other animals. There is a vaccine available for equine animals, but not for humans. - Mod.TY
