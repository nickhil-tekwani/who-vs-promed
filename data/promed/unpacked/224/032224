Kruger Park drains dam after animal deaths
------------------------------------------
Conservation authorities began to drain the Silolweni dam on Tuesday
[15 Apr 2008] to prevent algal poisoning of the wildlife in the area,
the Kruger National Park said.

The decision was made after conservation officials and rangers found
5 zebra carcasses near the Tshokwane picnic site and suspected that
blue green algae (cyanobacteria) were responsible for the deaths.

This was confirmed after full post mortems were done on 2 carcasses
-- by state veterinarian Roy Bengis -- and water samples from the dam
revealed a high concentration of the algae.

"We understand that the large concentration of this algal poison was
built up due to the high concentration of hippo currently found in
the dam ... we have found that the most effective way to discourage
the hippos from visiting the dam is to lower the level of the water,"
said Freek Venter, the park's head of conservation management.

The grass around the dam was also burnt, prior to the draining, to
discourage animals from grazing near it.

The pump apparatus will be visible from the H1-2 tar road between
Skukuza and Tshokwane and the tourist parking area near the dam.

Silolweni Dam is very popular as a game-viewing site and is visited
by thousands of tourists every year, the park said.

"A number of options were considered before it was decided to drain
the dam using floating pumps set up in the middle of the dam and, as
this is the 2nd case in the last 12 months where algal poisoning has
caused multiple animal deaths, we are currently looking at permanent
solutions to this problem," said Venter.

The Nhlanganzwane dam near Crocodile Bridge Rest Camp was breached in
July 2007 after it was discovered that the same algal poisoning had
killed more than 54 animals.
