Equine Herpes Suspected at Bowie Center
---------------------------------------------
The Maryland Jockey Club says a horse at its Bowie Training Center
has been isolated from other horses after showing signs of what may
be EHV-1, equine herpes virus. The virus can cause upper respiratory
infection, and may lead to neurological disease.
The signs were noticed Tuesday [22 Jan 2008], prompting calls to a
veterinarian and the Maryland Department of Agriculture. Blood
samples and nasal swabs were taken for testing. Results are expected
later this week.
The horse has been moved to an empty barn. Other horses that had been
in close contact with the horse are now restricted largely to their
barn and are not allowed to race.

[Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral
disease (EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe
respiratory infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease,
or abortion in pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The
immunity conferred by the disease or the vaccine is relatively short.
Horses on the show or racing circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months.
Isolating the horse and essentially quarantining the others until the
tests are confirmed either positive or negative is likely a good
idea. Let us also hope the equipment is being restricted to single
horse use and disinfected. - Mod.TG]
