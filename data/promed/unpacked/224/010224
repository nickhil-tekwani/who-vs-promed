A euthanized horse from Staten Island has tested positive for West Nile
virus. State Agriculture Commissioner, Nathan L. Rudgers, today announced
the death of a 26-year old horse on Staten Island due to [infection with
West Nile virus, along with other medical complications. The horse became
ill on 17 Aug 2000, showing signs of muscle tremors and an inability to
rise without assistance; all possible signs of equine encephalitis. In
addition, the horse had evidence of kidney failure. The horse was
euthanized on 20 Aug 2000.
Extensive information on West Nile Virus can be accessed at the State
Department of Health's web site - .

[Horses become infected with West Nile Virus when bitten by infected
mosquitoes. Horses cannot transmit West Nile virus to other horses, people
or pets, and not all horses that are infected with West Nile Virus become
ill. In 1999, samples from clinically normal horses that were stall-mates
of affected horses showed that 29 percent of these horses experienced
sub-clinical infection. Last year, 25 horses on Long Island were clinically
ill with neurologic signs and had evidence of infection with West Nile
Virus. Nine of those horses died or were euthanized. -Mod.CP
