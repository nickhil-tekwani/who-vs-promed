At least 66 cases of measles were recorded between January and March 2014 in the city of Quiculungo, in the Angolan province of Kwanza Norte, the interim director of the municipal hospital, Kifinamena I Luzolo, confirmed today [5 Apr 2014]. "Of these, 63 children from 0-5 years old were diagnosed with the condition, whereas there are 3 adults affected," Luzolo revealed to ANGOP news agency.

He explained that patients received clinical and drug treatments dependent on symptoms. "Medical care focused on antibiotics, and serum vitamin A," he said [There are no antimicrobials known to be effective against measles, but vitamin A will benefit those who are deficient and has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. - Mod.LM]. The official said that in the same period, 5 patients were hospitalized in serious condition, and cases were reported affecting 3 children under 9 months.

To prevent spread, health services Quiculungo, 138 km north east of the provincial capital Delantando, conducted a vaccination campaign.

Recent estimates by the World Health Organization show that annual numbers of deaths worldwide from measles broke record lows and went from more than 562 000 in 2000 to 122 000 in 2012, representing a reduction of 78 per cent.

Efforts to contain an ongoing measles epidemic affecting the Chadian capital of N'djamena must be immediately stepped up, said the international medical-humanitarian organisation, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).

Despite a recent vaccination campaign carried out by the Ministry of Health, patients continue to flow into MSF-supported hospitals and health centres, with 2511 cases of the disease reported in the capital since the beginning of January 2014. MSF is urging Chadian health authorities to rapidly increase their response to the epidemic by re-launching vaccination, improving treatment of the disease in hospitals, and ensuring that existing drug supplies reach health centres.

"Without a more appropriate response to the epidemic, many more patients risk dying from this preventable disease," said Jerome Alin, MSF's head of mission in Chad. "Typically, following a mass vaccination campaign, we should see the number of measles cases decline. However, we are still seeing a significant number of patients, even though the campaign finished 4 weeks ago."

Medical data from the isolation wards in the hospitals show that the majority of the patients have not actually been vaccinated. Last week alone, 80 per cent of MSF's patients reported that they were not immunised. MSF has launched short-term support to the Ministry of Health in N'djamena in the Liberty and Union Hospitals and in 7 health centres. So far, teams have treated more than 1765 patients with measles. MSF planned its support until the end of the 1st week of April 2014 due to the number of severe cases still being admitted in the hospital. MSF will extend its support to the Ministry of Health in Hopital la Liberte up to the end of April 2014.

MSF is increasingly concerned about the disease spreading further, with a growing number of patients coming from some areas on the outskirts of the capital. "Ideally, a new vaccination campaign should be launched, targeting these affected areas," continued Alin. In addition, the lack of drugs reaching health centres is alarming. Despite the availability of medicines in N'Djamena to treat measles, supplies are not being dispatched to reach the affected population, and MSF is currently the sole provider of medications. "It is an absolute priority that drugs and medical equipment are immediately provided to the health centres," said Alin. "When we complete our support to the centres in a few days' time, the health authorities must step up their capacity to provide this essential, free of charge treatment."

North east of N'djamena, MSF is also responding to the measles epidemic in the Massakory district in Hadjer Lamis. The organisation is carrying out a one-month-long vaccination campaign for 42 000 children aged between 6 and 59 months. Between the end of January 2014 and now, 193 cases have been recorded, and MSF has treated 112 of these at Massakory Hospital.

Since the number of reported measles cases surged in mid-January 2014, more than 5000 suspected cases have been reported from Amhara, Gambella, Oromia, SNNP [Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's] and Tigray regions, 975 of which have been confirmed.

Close to 2 million children under 15 years of age in Sidama, Silte and Wolayita zones of SNNPR, and some 250 000 children under 15 in selected kebeles [villages] of Amhara region were vaccinated. The government and health partners prepared a national measles outbreak response plan for a measles vaccination campaign targeting 6.7 million children under 15 in 125 woredas [districts].

An adult in Hamilton, Ontario, which has a population of 500 000, has tested positive for the virus and could have exposed others, CBC reports. The site has a list of locations in Hamilton, Burlington, and Mississauga where the patient had been over the last 9 days, including spaces that cater for children.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, measles is a highly infectious disease spread by direct contact or secretions from an infected person's nose or mouth. The most apparent outward symptom of measles is a rash that begins on the face and moves downward, which usually appears 3 to 7 days after other viral symptoms, like a fever, runny nose, irritability and red eyes/sensitivity to light.

Vaccines for measles are given at 12 months as part of a shot that includes measles, mumps and rubella, and a 2nd dose at 18 months, or 4 to 6 years of age. For that reason, children under the age of one are particularly vulnerable, as are pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems. Measles can be fatal, and the World Health Organization reported 122 000 deaths from measles globally in 2012. Other outbreaks across Canada this year [2014] have included 288 cases in British Columbia, 4 in Calgary, 2 in Ottawa and 4 in Saskatchewan. Measles has also been reported in New York City and Boston.

Lack of immunization is being noted as a cause for concern. "It's in those pockets of unimmunized or under-immunized kids where measles can, because it's such an infectious disease, get into those populations," Dr John Spika, director general of the centre for immunization and respiratory infectious diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada, told the CBC.

However, in Calgary, 3 of the 4 infected had been vaccinated for measles, reports the Calgary Herald. Alberta medical officer Dr Judy MacDonald did note that the illnesses were far less serious than if they had not been vaccinated, and very rare in general.

The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommends getting immunized for measles, though vaccinations are not mandatory for a child to enter school, notes the Public Health Agency. If parents choose not to vaccinate their child, the child may be told to stay home from school if there is an outbreak of disease.

http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/Manitoba-sees-two-new-cases-of-measles-253767131.html


Two more cases of measles have been confirmed in Manitoba, bringing the total this year [2014] to 4. One of the newly reported cases is a teenage boy who lives in the Southern Health region, while the other is a woman in her 40s from Winnipeg. Public health officials are investigating the cases to identify persons who may have come in contact with the individuals.

They say that people who were at the following locations should be aware of the possibility of infection: Polo Park Shopping Centre, Sat 22 Mar 2014 between 11 am and 1 pm; St Vital Shopping Centre, Sat 22 Mar 2014 between 1:30 and 2 pm; and St Boniface General Hospital emergency room between 9:45 pm on Wed 26 Mar 2014 and 11:30 pm on Thu 27 Mar 2014. People who visited these locations and think they might have measles or have been in close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with measles should contact their doctor or call Health Links at 204-788-8200 or 1-888-315-9257 (toll-free) for more information.

Measles is spread through droplets in the air formed when coughing or sneezing. An infected person can spread the virus from 4 days before the rash appears to 4 days after it is seen. The disease tends to be more severe in infants and young children and can be life-threatening. Symptoms of measles generally appear 7 to 21 days after exposure. Initial symptoms may include fever, runny nose, drowsiness, irritability and red eyes. Small white spots may also develop on the inside of the mouth or throat. Several days after the initial symptoms, a red blotchy rash appears on the face and progresses down the body.

Measles can lead to complications including ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia (lung infection) and encephalitis (brain inflammation). Provincial officials say immunization is the best way to protect oneself from measles.

Vaccines are provided for children who are at least one year of age, and a 2nd dose is given when aged 4 to 6. The effectiveness of a single dose of measles vaccine given at 12 or 15 months of age is estimated to be 85 to 95 per cent. With a 2nd dose, efficacy is almost 100 per cent. Adults born before 1970 are generally presumed to have acquired natural immunity to measles, however, some may be susceptible. Adults born in 1970 or later who do not have a record showing they received a measles vaccine, or who have not had a history of laboratory-confirmed measles infection, should be immunized, officials said.

Edmonton is now reporting a case of measles in its region, a day after Calgary confirmed 2 further cases in the city, bringing the total number of cases for the contagious virus in the province to 6. According to Global News, Alberta Health Services confirmed the cases today [3 Apr 2014], noting public locations from 25-26 Mar 2014 where people may have been exposed to the virus.

Measles, which is spread through direct contact or airborne secretions from an infected person, has been reported in various parts of Canada throughout the beginning of 2014, including a case of 288 people affected in British Columbia, 10 in Saskatchewan, 2 in Ottawa and 3 in Hamilton, one in Kitchener-Waterloo, as well as the aforementioned cases in Alberta. Many of the outbreaks have been connected to overseas travel, prompting Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr Arlene King, to issue a warning to be vigilant.

"In 2014, 11 cases of measles have been reported in Ontario, and all of these 11 cases were directly or indirectly associated with travel to the Philippines, Taiwan and Europe," Dr King said at a press conference on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014], according to the Globe and Mail. "Measles anywhere is a threat everywhere."

CDC has released the latest measles case count for the United States. We are now up to 108 cases. While that still may not seem like a lot to some people, to keep that number in perspective, consider that in 2011, which was a record year for measles: we had only seen 39 cases at this same point in the year; it wasn't until mid-June 2014 that we broke 100 cases (105 on 5 Jun 2014). Of course, we ended up with 220 cases in 2011, the most in a single year since 1996.

Since measles is a disease that classically begins to spread in late winter and early spring, that would certainly make it seem like we have a long way to go this year [2014]. And it would certainly make it seem like this would be a good time to get your kids and yourself caught up on the MMR vaccine. Remember, children usually get their 1st dose at age 12 to 15 months and a 2nd dose between ages 4 and 6 years. This is also a good time for unvaccinated adults who were born in 1957 or after to get immunized.

http://www.examiner.com/article/measles-outbreak-2014-20-new-cases-due-to-unvaccinated-children


An outbreak of measles, a highly contagious viral illness that is spread through respiration, is being reported in many states including California, New York City, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Pennsylvania.

According to a 31 Mar 2014 report in TODAY's Health, Dr Nancy Snyderman, NBC News' chief medical editor, discussed the measles outbreak in Southern California and the symptoms of the illness. "There have been 49 cases confirmed in the state so far this year [2014]. Eight big pockets are accounting for 77 per cent of cases in this country, and there are 2 reasons: under-vaccinated children or unvaccinated children," and experts expect that more outbreaks will be seen."

Classic symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny eyes or nose, and a recognizable rash. The highly contagious virus spreads when an infected person sneezes or coughs.

Measles cases had been greatly reduced in the United States after the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s; but in recent years, there has been more fear when it comes to getting children immunized, placing the emphasis on linking immunizations with numerous health-related problems, including autism.

Dr Greg Wallace, head of the Centers for Disease Control Measles, Mumps, Rubella, and Polio team, said that: "Vaccinated people can carry the disease, and when they come into contact with unvaccinated people, these people contract the illness. 90 per cent of the time, unvaccinated people get the illness. It's the most contagious of the vaccinated diseases," Wallace said, "and because there are so few effective treatments for measles, vaccines are the best way to prevent it." Wallace continued, "The vaccine does work, and these outbreaks don't occur unless you have enough people who have not been vaccinated."

The Michigan Department of Community Health has been urging Michigan residents to get a measles vaccine as far back as 2011. "This is especially important for persons planning international travel, because the current US situation is largely the result of measles outbreaks occurring elsewhere in the world," said Dr Dean Sienko, Michigan health department acting chief medical executive. "But it's also important that non-travelers be protected. We have to keep our guard up against measles by having as many of our citizens protected as possible. This is an easily preventable disease."

Parents consciously choosing not to vaccinate their children for measles is exacerbating an outbreak in Orange County, a state health official said. "The current pertussis and measles outbreaks in the state are perfect examples of the consequences and costs to individuals and communities when parents choose not to vaccinate their children," said Dr Gil Chavez, deputy director, state epidemiologist, Center for Infectious Diseases in the California Department of Public Health. Orange County's 21 reported measles cases this year [2014] are far outpacing the rest of the state, public health officials recently said.

One contributing factor is parents who decide against immunization. The Orange County Register reported that parents are opting out of measles vaccines when they enroll their children into kindergarten at the following rates around Orange County:

Capistrano Unified: About 9 per cent
Laguna Beach Unified: 12 per cent
Newport Mesa Unified: 6 per cent
Saddleback Unified, Fountain Valley Schools and Los Alamitos Unified all came in with waiver rates between 2.7 and 5.2 per cent.

Californians can skip vaccinations for religious reasons and don't have to explain that is their reason. But the state passed a law in 2012 requiring parents who opt out to sign a document that verifies they understand the benefits of vaccines, reports the AllGov blog, which monitors governmental agencies. "Parents make decisions about immunizations for their children based on their understanding of the risks of immunizations versus the risks of the diseases which immunizations prevent," Chavez told Patch. "We want parents to have an accurate understanding about how safe immunizations are [and] how dangerous vaccine-preventable diseases can be to their child, family and community."

Dr Matt Zahn of the Orange County Health Care Agency said he's frustrated. Measles was eradicated in the US. Now it's back, and the danger isn't just from foreigners. Even more frustrating is that the vaccine is perfectly safe, he said. Concerns that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causes autism and other maladies is scientifically unfounded, Zahn said.

Baystate Medical Center is informing the community that a patient at the hospital has a confirmed case of measles. The safety of our patients and visitors is our absolute highest priority. Measles is a contagious illness, and people without immunity who were in proximity to the patient at Baystate Medical Center's main campus on 2-3 Apr 2014 may be at risk of developing measles. Baystate has been working to identify and contact all individuals who, due to their proximity to the patient in a limited number of areas within the hospital before the measles diagnosis was made and protective steps were taken, may be at elevated risk for exposure to measles.

Because the suspected diagnosis of measles was made quickly after the patient was initially seen, Baystate believes that the group of people potentially exposed to measles at the hospital is limited to about 300 individuals. In partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and those individuals' primary care providers, Baystate is making direct notifications to those determined to be at elevated risk and working closely with primary care providers to ensure patients get what they need, including information, immunizations or other preventive treatment where appropriate.

People with the potential for exposure are being asked to be watchful for symptoms of measles and should call their healthcare provider, if they develop symptoms, before visiting a healthcare facility. Visiting a healthcare facility with symptoms of measles puts others at risk.

Symptoms of measles occur 10 days to 2 weeks after exposure and may resemble a cold (with fever, cough, runny nose, and red eyes), but a rash occurs on the skin 2-4 days after the initial symptoms develop. The rash usually appears 1st on the head and moves downward. The rash typically lasts a few days and then disappears in the same order. People with measles may be contagious up to 4 days before the rash appears and for 4 days after the day the rash appears.

"We're sharing this message widely with the community because we want people to be aware and informed, and we want to take the highest level of precautions to prevent the spread of the illness," said Dr Douglas Salvador, vice president of medical affairs for Baystate Medical Center. "Most people are immune or have been vaccinated, but given that measles is now present in our community, we encourage anyone with concerns to check into their vaccinations and immunity to measles and to be on the lookout for symptoms."

Now that the patient has been identified and is being cared for, that patient does not pose any additional measles risk to others.

[One upside of the stunning reemergence of measles this year [2014] in the US is increasing recognition of the disease by clinicians.

New York City Health Commissioner Mary Bassett announced on Tuesday [1 Apr 2014] that the number of cases of measles confirmed in New York City has jumped to 25 since February 2014, up from 16 as of 7 Mar 2014. The majority of the cases in the current outbreak have been centered in Northern Manhattan, with a newer cluster of 3 cases in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. 12 of the cases involve children.

The New York City Health Department recommends that all pediatric health care providers who have patients in the impacted areas contact the families of children under the age of 12 months and request that they receive MMR vaccination, and that all children who have already received the 1st dose of the MMR vaccine receive the 2nd dose immediately.

Any person who suspects they may have contracted the measles virus is asked to contact a medical provider before seeking medical attention to reduce the risk of exposing others to the virus.

The measles virus was believed to have been nearly eliminated in the United States due to the use of vaccinations. Between 2001 and 2011, there were just 83 cases of measles per year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2013, there were 189 cases of measles, and there have already been more than 80 in 2014.

Meanwhile, more than 20 people have been diagnosed with measles in Orange County, California, and more than 40 have had the measles at some point this year [2014]. Despite the uptick in measles cases, the California Department of Public Health says over 16 000 kids began kindergarten this school year without getting vaccinated.

A person who was confirmed with measles traveled to several western Washington public locations while contagious. Most people in our state are immune to measles, so the public risk is low except for people who are unvaccinated. People who haven't been vaccinated or aren't sure whether they're immune should ask a health care professional for advice.

Public health officials say the Whatcom County woman in her 20s became contagious with measles on 26 Mar 2014 after visiting a local family with measles linked to an outbreak in British Columbia. She worked at the Lynden Dutch Bakery while contagious. Measles is highly contagious and can cause severe illness with rash, fever, cough, eye irritation, and can be fatal.

The woman traveled to Seattle for a Kings of Leon concert at Key Arena on 28 Mar 2014, when she also was at the Best Western Loyal Inn and the Wasabi Bistro. The next day, she was at Beth's Cafe, Aurora Suzuki, Starbucks at 1st and Pike, and the Pike Place Market. On those same dates, she visited several locations in Pierce County, including Celebrity Cake Studio, LeMay Car Museum, Harmon Brewing Company, and some department stores. A complete list of the locations and the times of potential public exposure are available online.

Anyone who was in those locations at the listed times should find out whether they have been vaccinated for measles or have had measles previously. People who are unvaccinated, who aren't sure whether they're immune, and who develop an illness with fever or unexplained rash should consult a health care professional immediately. Public health officials urge them to call ahead to their clinic, doctor's office, or emergency room before arriving so people in waiting rooms aren't exposed.

Measles is highly contagious even before the rash starts and is easily spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes; if you're not vaccinated, you can get the measles just by walking into a room where someone with the disease has been in the past couple of hours.

Washington typically has 5 or fewer measles cases per year; so far in 2014, there have been 7. Symptoms begin 7-21 days after exposure, and an infected person is contagious for about 4 days before the rash appears until 4 days afterward. People at highest risk from exposure to measles include those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age and those with weakened immune systems.

Children should be vaccinated with 2 doses of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, with the 1st dose between 12 and 15 months and the 2nd at 4-6 years. Adults should have at least one measles vaccination, with some people needing 2. The state Department of Health immunization program has more information about measles and measles vaccine.

In an unrelated situation, a single measles case in San Juan County has been confirmed, and health officials are working to contact people who may have been exposed. Information is available on the state health department website and online from San Juan County.

Also, a traveler from California passed through SeaTac Airport on 21-22 Mar 2014 while contagious with measles. Public Health - Seattle & King County is leading the investigation.

"Two deaths [from measles] have been reported from Thatta," confirmed the provincial health secretary. The outbreak of measles in different villages of Thatta and Sajawal district has presented another challenge for the provincial health authorities after the Tharparkar crisis. At least 2 children have died in Thatta district, and several others have reportedly been diagnosed with the viral disease over the last few days.

"Two deaths have been reported from Thatta," confirmed the provincial health secretary, Iqbal Hussain Durrani. He said that the situation was under control and that all children of the province would be vaccinated soon. Durrani told the Express Tribune that the affected areas of Thatta district were a priority and that his department would act promptly as 200 children had died last year [2013].

Though health officials are still not sure whether both the boys from UC Sonda died because of measles, they believe the symptoms were indicative of the viral disease and that it could affect other healthy children. The 1st child was reported to be affected by the virus on 7 Mar 2014 and to have died on the way to the district hospital. The 2nd child was referred from the district hospital to Karachi but died at the National Institute of Child Health last week.

"Laboratory tests will confirm the cause of death," said the district health officer, Dr Zahoor Ahmed Memon. "Unusual cases could be reported anywhere. There is no measles outbreak in my district," he said.

A majority of pregnant women are anaemic in coastal areas, including Thatta, Sajawal and Badin districts, because of poverty. Their children, meanwhile, are severely malnourished. Health officials say that resistance to the viral disease among children is weak due to malnourishment.

Vaccinations are being started from Monday [7 Apr 2014] in Thatta and Sajawal districts. The 1st phase, which will run from 7-13 Apr 2014, will target children of 3 talukas, including Thatta, Sajawal and Jati. The 2nd phase will run from 14-20 Apr 2014 in the remaining parts of Thatta and Sajawal districts.

The government will aim to vaccinate 414 545 children in both districts. Dr Memon said that out of 55 UCs, 7 have already been covered. Children above 9 months and below 11 years of age will be targeted.
