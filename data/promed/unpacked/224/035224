A foot-and-mouth disease outbreak has been detected in San Jacinto del
Bua rural parish in Santo Domingo de las Tsachilas province in
Ecuador. Yesterday [25 Jul 2011], the Ecuadorian Agency for Quality
Assurance in Agriculture (AGROCALIDAD, according to its initials in
Spanish) confirmed the occurrence of the disease.

Even though authorities refused to give details, it was extra
officially known that 30 animals may be affected.

The mobilization of every type of livestock has been suspended in the
affected area, including horses and pigs, in order to prevent
dissemination of the aforementioned disease.

Also, the local committee is not allowed to issue mobilization
guidelines for livestock in farms located in San Jacinto del Bua rural
parish.

Mr Luis Brazales, head of AGROCALIDAD, pointed out that they had
started a re-immunization campaign in the San Jacinto area and they
expect to finish it in the next few days. He said that vaccines were
given out at no cost by AGROCALIDAD, in order to have animals
immunized and to prevent the spread of the disease to other areas. A
30-day state of alert has been declared, which will be in vigor until
it is considered that there is no additional risk.

Controls will be performed today [26 Jul 2011] in the Cattle Breeders
Association (ASOGAN, according to its initials in Spanish) fair, and
surveillance will be enforced in all roads in the region in order to
verify that every farmer mobilizing livestock has every document in
order, including vaccination certificates.

During the 1st phase of the vaccination campaign, 226 700 doses were
administered all over the country.

[The article does not tell us the serotype of the outbreak. So one can
only presume it has been serotyped since they are vaccinating. Most of
the vaccines do not cross protect, so it is important to vaccinate
with the same serotype as the one involved in the outbreak. Although
the article does not specify, it is most likely in cattle. It is nice
they are jumping on it quickly. - Mod.TG]
