I note the possibility of ground water contamination in the Sydney water
supply. The Greater Victoria area, British Columbia, had a problem of
excess acute _Toxoplasma_ infections, documented by Bowie et al Lancet
1997;350:173-177, which was assumed to be ground water contamination of the
municipal water supply plus filter break-down. A massive screening program
for pregnant women was developed and 36 acute infections identified. I
wonder if the possibility of _Toxoplasma_ contamination and risk to
pregnant women has been considered in Sydney. I am a pathologist
(virologist) somewhat sensitized to _Toxoplasma_ infections in pregnancy
since our laboratory is responsible locally for _Toxoplasma_ serology and
PCR testing of amniotic fluid for _Toxoplasma_ DNA.

[Having once been involved in the serological monitoring of some 1,700
pregnant women here in Baton Rouge, I would point out that such procedures
are not straightforward. Some pregnant women with prior & chronic
_Toxoplasma_ infections can suffer from the rupture of these cysts and a
resulting increase in titres, though the pregnancy may not be at risk. My
memory tells me that we had five such women and all were delivered of
normal infants. That is beside the point ... the question remains whether
the Sidney Public Health authorities have considered such a scenario as
described by Kitty Croxson. - Mod.MHJ

in the complexities of municipal public health, real and perceived.
ProMED-mail is not a forum for lawyers and politics but we should be aware
of them and their impacts on the future control efficiency and
cost-effectiveness. No further communications related to this dimension of
the Sidney problem will be posted. Any comments should be sent directly to

I've noted the deletion of references to the "circling lawyers" in the
previous posting on this subject, but some attention needs to be paid to
them. A number of firms have taken to the media touting for business,
including the placement of advertisements in daily newspapers, seeking
participation in a class action against Sydney Water. One such
advertisement had a fill in and clip out coupon. The basis of the class
action would seem to be compensation for measures taken to avoid exposure
to giardia, such as the purchase of bottled water.
It would seem to me that any successful class action would have at least
two effects: (1) any damages payable by Sydney Water would merely be passed
on to consumers by way of increased water rates; and (2) while Sydney
Water's immediate response may be criticised, in the end it recommended the
broadest possible response to the situation, covering the entire Sydney
metropolitan area, not just those serviced by the affected station. Any
successful class action might have the effect of encouraging a minimal or
contained response in future, rather than the broadly applied measures seen
in this instance. I would be interested in any views on this matter.
Furthermore, a representative of one of the more aggressive law firms (I
know, it sounds tautologous, but believe me the qualifier is necessary) was
interviewed on a radio current affairs this morning (August 3, 1998) saying
that Sydney Water had to pay massive damages because this situation was
"unprecedented in the Western world". Can anyone assist in ascertaining the
veracity of this statement?

In the past, Sydney Water Board assisted public anxiety about sewage
pollution to Sydney beaches as a precursor to a special tax that basically
enabled construction of very expensive engineering works for sewerage
ocean-outfalls.
I am sufficiently skeptical therefore, as to wonder whether the present
"crisis" about Sydney water precedes some new, very expensive, other
engineering works in the water treatment system; a move to resurrect the
Welcome Reef Dam/ Upper Shoalhaven River water supply for Sydney scheme; or
something to do with further privatisation of Sydney water supply. I
understand that the health service at our University has for a long time
and on a regular basis, been dealing with the presentation of giardiasis so
the issue is not really new. We can watch with interest as the crisis
develops in the media.
