To date, 7 people in the area affected by Hurricane Katrina have been
reported to be ill from bacterial infection due to _Vibrio vulnificus_. 4
have died. The 1st cases were reported by the Mississippi Department of Health.
_V. vulnificus_ can cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are
exposed to warm seawater. People at greatest risk for illness from _V.
vulnificus_ are those with weakened immune systems and the elderly. Because
_V. vulnificus_ is a bacterium in the same family as the bacterium that
causes cholera, some media reports have confused the 2 pathogens.
As part of the current investigation, CDC and other response agencies are
working with health departments in affected states to help identify persons
who might be at increased risk for _V. vulnificus_ and recommend
appropriate treatment for them.
What is _Vibrio vulnificus_?
----------------------------
_V. vulnificus_ is a bacterium that is a rare cause of illness in the USA.
The illness is very different from cholera, which is caused by different
bacteria, called _Vibrio cholerae_. _V. vulnificus_ infections do not
spread directly from one person to another, and are a serious health threat
predominantly to persons with underlying illness, such as liver disease or
a compromised immune system. The organism is a natural inhabitant of warm
coastal waters. Infection can occur after a wound is exposed to warm
coastal waters where _V. vulnificus_ is growing. Infection may also be
acquired by eating raw or undercooked seafood from those waters.
CDC receives reports of over 400 _Vibrio_ illnesses each year. Of those,
about 90 are due to _V. vulnificus_. Most _V. vulnificus_ illness occurs
during warm-weather months.
Symptoms of infection with _V. vulnificus_
------------------------------------------
- acute illness, with a rapid decline in health following exposure.
- if exposed by contamination of an open wound, increasing swelling,
redness, and pain at the site of the wound.
- illness typically begins within 1-3 days of exposure, but begins as late
as 7 days after exposure for a small percentage of cases.
- fever
- swelling and redness of skin on arms or legs, with blood-tinged blisters
- low blood pressure and shock
By contrast, the symptoms of cholera are profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting,
cramps, and low-grade fever.
Illness caused by _V. vulnificus_
---------------------------------
Wound infections may start as redness and swelling at the site of the wound
that then can progress to affect the whole body. _V. vulnificus_ typically
causes a severe and life-threatening illness characterized by fever and
chills, decreased blood pressure (septic shock), and blood-tinged
blistering skin lesions (hemorrhagic bullae). Overall, _V. vulnificus_
infections are fatal about 40 per cent of the time. Wound infections with
_V. vulnificus_ are fatal about 20 per cent of the time, and aggressive
surgical treatment can prevent death.
How people become infected
--------------------------
_V. vulnificus_ is found in oysters and other shellfish in warm coastal
waters during the summer months. Since it is naturally found in warm marine
waters, people with open wounds can be exposed to _V. vulnificus_ through
direct contact with seawater, shellfish, and marine wildlife. There is no
evidence for person-to-person transmission of _V. vulnificus_.
People who have immunocompromising conditions, and especially those with
chronic liver disease, are particularly at risk for _V. vulnificus_
infection when they eat raw or undercooked seafood, particularly shellfish
harvested from the Gulf of Mexico, or if they bathe a cut or scrape in
marine waters. About 3/4 of patients with _Vibrio vulnificus_ infections
have known underlying hepatic disease or other immunocompromising illness.
Otherwise healthy persons are at much lower risk of _V. vulnificus_ infection.
Concerns in hurricane-affected areas
------------------------------------
People with immunocompromising conditions and especially those with chronic
liver disease should avoid exposure of open wounds or broken skin to warm
salt or brackish water, and avoid consuming undercooked shellfish harvested
from such waters. After a coastal flood disaster, large numbers of persons
with illnesses that affect their resistance to infection may be exposed to
seawater. Injury prevention is especially important in high-risk persons.
Wounds exposed to seawater should be washed with soap and water as soon as
possible, infected wounds should be evaluated by a doctor, and clinicians
should aggressively monitor these wounds.
Diagnosis
---------
_V. vulnificus_ infection is diagnosed by microbiologic culture of the
wound, by blood cultures, or by stool culture in the case of patients who
consumed raw or undercooked seafood.
Treatment
---------
_V. vulnificus_ infection is treated with antibiotics. When this infection
is suspected, treatment with a combination of a 3rd-generation
cephalosporin (such as ceftazidime) and doxycycline is recommended. _V.
vulnificus_ wound infections should be treated with aggressive attention to
the wound site; amputation of the affected limb is sometimes necessary.

Stagnant floodwaters in New Orleans contain a dangerous slurry of fecal
bacteria estimated at 10 times the level considered safe for skin contact,
and the tainted water has caused 3 deaths from a rare infection, federal
officials said yesterday, Wed, 7 Sep 2005.
"The water is full of sewage," said Dr Julie Gerberding, director of the
CDC, who urged stragglers to "cooperate with the evacuation effort and leave."
Officials warned that the water is dangerous both for residents, and for
those attempting to evacuate stragglers from the city. "Human contact with
the floodwater should be avoided as much as possible," said Stephen L
Johnson, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Rescuers
were urged to wear appropriate protective gear. He said scientists have yet
to test stagnant floodwaters in and around industrial sites.
CDC spokesman Von Roebuck said yesterday that experts suspect people who
contracted _Vibrio vulnificus_ from wounds or cuts that became infected as
they waded in floodwaters. The cases were reported in a New Orleans evacuee
in Texas and 4 in Mississippi.
Gerberding said the agency is investigating the cases of infection by _V.
vulnificus_, which she emphasized "in no way resembles cholera."
"This does not represent an outbreak," Gerberding said. "People who are
compromised in immunity can develop severe illnesses" when exposed to the
microbe, Gerberding added. "We see cases of this from time to time along
the Gulf Coast." Among those in shelters, she also reported sporadic cases
of gastrointestinal illnesses, none of which poses an epidemic danger. In
addition, because of crowding in shelters, conditions exist for infections
with norovirus, a microbe that occasionally causes outbreaks of
gastrointestinal illness on cruise ships. "The secret is hygiene," she
said, noting that health care workers in the shelters have emphasized
handwashing and the use of hand sanitizers.
The presence of fecal coliform bacteria, which includes _E. coli_ and other
human intestinal bacteria, serve as markers for widespread raw sewage in
the stagnant pools, experts say.
Water samples in many city neighborhoods also have revealed
higher-than-usual levels of lead, which can pose dangers, especially for
children, if the water is ingested. Lead exposure is linked to mental
retardation and learning disabilities.

[The CDC alert now mentions 7 cases with 4 deaths; one report posted
yesterday said 5 had died of this infection. The 2nd posting clearly speaks
of the coliform contamination of the waters in the area. By this, it is
meant that contamination with fecal waste has occurred, and infections such
as salmonellosis can be spread this way. It is important to note that _V.
vulnificus_ can be present in non-contaminated waters as a normal
inhabitant of salt water; acquisition, therefore, does not mean contact
with coliform-containing water as implied in this posting. Although the
incubation period of this infection is several days, the prolonged flooding
certainly makes more cases possible. - Mod.LL]
