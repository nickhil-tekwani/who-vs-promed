CHYTRID FUNGUS, FROG - SOUTH KOREA

Scientists reported that a deadly disease sweeping through the
populations of frogs, toads, newts and other amphibians across the
globe has reached South Korean shores, heightening concerns over the
protection of local species.

A research team led by Seoul National University (SNU)'s Lee Hang
confirmed the local existence of the killer disease, chytridiomycosis.

The fungal disease is blamed for the extinction of about 1/3rd of the
120 frog species lost since the 1980s.

In a study published in peer-review journal Disease of Aquatic
Organisms, Lee's team said _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ (Bd), the
fungus that causes chytridiomycosis, was discovered in 7 frog species
collected from wildlife here.

The fungus was also present in frogs imported as pets, which is likely
how the disease got to Korea, Lee said.

"These results confirm that Bd is present in South Korea and, hence,
on the Asian mainland. Studies are urgently required to determine the
impact of chytridiomycosis on Korean amphibians and to map the
distribution of Bd in Korea and other Asian mainland countries," the
study said.

Lee said that the arrival of chytridiomycosis could further threaten
locally endangered amphibians such as the "maeng kkongi," or
narrow-mouthed frog, and the Korean golden frog.

The disease kills the animals by damaging their skin, thus blocking
the passage of air and moisture and effectively suffocating them.

Bd, first identified in 1998, is firmly established in parts of the
Americas, Australia and Europe, but its presence in Asia has not been
previously confirmed. Lee called for stronger measures to detect
diseases in imported animals more quickly and prevent them from
spreading.

"Past studies have shown that that the international transmission
route of chytridiomycosis has been provided by the movement of
amphibian animals from country to country through trade," Lee said.

Chytridiomycosis was added to the list of wildlife diseases of concern
to the OIE (World Organisation of Animal Health) in 2001. The disease
has so far proven unstoppable in the wild, with scientists saying it
can kill up to 80 percent of a native amphibian population within 4 to
6 months after its arrival.

However, not all amphibians develop the disease, as some species carry
and spread the fungus without developing any symptoms.

detection of the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium
dendrobatidis in free-ranging populations of amphibians on mainland
Asia: survey in South Korea. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms 86:9-13.

ABSTRACT: "Chytridiomycosis, a disease that has caused amphibian
population declines globally and elevated many species of anurans to
endangered or threatened status, has recently been declared an
internationally notifiable disease. _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_
(Bd), the amphibian chytrid fungus causing this disease, has not been
previously reported in Korea or on mainland Asia. 36 frog specimens
representing 7 species were collected from the wild in South Korea and
examined for Bd using standard PCR. Bd was detected in 14 (38.8
percent) samples from 3 species (_Bufo gargarizans_, _Hyla japonica_,
and _Rana catesbiana_). Skin sections from all 14 PCR-positive frogs
were examined using 2 staining techniques: haematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) and Bd immunoperoxidase (IPX). In histological sections,
zoosporangia were found in 6 frogs, with lower sensitivity for H&E (21
percent) than for IPX (46 percent). Intensity of infection, based on
histopathology, was low in all frogs. These !
results confirm that Bd is present in South Korea and, hence, on the
Asian mainland. Studies are urgently required to determine the impact
of chytridiomycosis on Korean amphibians and to map the distribution
of Bd in Korea and other Asian mainland countries."

Chytridiomycosis is a key example of an emerging infectious disease in
wildlife. The most important factor driving the emergence of such
wildlife diseases is the anthropogenic (human-borne) introduction of
pathogens into new geographic areas (pathogen pollution). Following
its introduction, confining the disease is a complex or almost
unattainable goal.
