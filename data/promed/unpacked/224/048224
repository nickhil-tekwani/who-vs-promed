[1] Fiji, school (Taveuni)

Health authorities have declared a typhoid outbreak at a primary
school on Taveuni as well as warning residents living near the
Taveuni Central Indian School to take precautions and prevent the
spread of the disease. About 20 students from the school were
admitted to the island's hospital within a month.

Divisional medical officer Northern Dr Samuela Korovou said the
outbreak at the school was alarming because of its high number in a
small population. Dr Korovou said the school, with a roll of 420,
could close if more cases are confirmed.

Health officials on the island, who are closely monitoring the school
through an intensive contact tracing exercise, determined 10 students
who were healthy carriers were spreading the illness.

"These were students who had the typhoid bacterium but are not
displaying any symptoms," he said. "Some students have been admitted
in hospitals with high fever and diarrhea," he said. He said they
still had yet to identify the source of the outbreak. "We need to
look at cases individually because a possible source could exist
within the school or from the community of food handlers."

The number of cases from the school is far greater than the 4
recorded for Savusavu, considered a hotspot area for typhoid. School
manager Harish Topiwala denied claims by parents that sewer problems
at the school was the main cause.

[It is not likely that asymptomatic student carriers of _S. enterica_
serotype Typhi would be the source of the outbreak since the disease
is generally spread directly person-to-person requiring a significant
inoculum of bacteria to successfully be transmitted. Low ID50s (dose
to infect 50 percent of individuals) occur with _Shigella_ species
and _E. coli_ O157:H7 allowing these pathogens to be more easily
spread from person to person.

The Centre for Health Protection urges travellers to Indonesia to
guard against typhoid fever due rising cases of the disease in people
arriving from the country recently. The number of cases reported to
the centre for 2009 in April, May and June were 3, 8 and 12. 4 have
been received so far in July 2009.

21 of them stayed in Indonesia during the incubation period, 15 were
in Surabaya [Indonesia's 2nd-largest city, and the capital of the
province of East Java - Mod.LL] before coming to Hong Kong. 38 cases
have been reported so far in 2009, equaling the total number of cases in 2008.
