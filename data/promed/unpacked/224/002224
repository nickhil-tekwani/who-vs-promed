Prevalence of Enterovirus 71 in Korea during 2000
-------------------------------------------------
[This year several isolations of Enterovirus type 71 (EV71) have been made
from patients diagnosed with Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease (HFMD) and /or
aseptic meningitis in the mainland of Korea. Clinical samples taken from
such patients have been processed and inoculated onto RD, BGM and Vero
cells. RT-PCR assays were also performed [in parallel to detect the
presence of viral nucleic acid in the [original samples and in cell
culture supernatants, whether cytopathic effect was observed or not.
The National Institute of Health of Korea has [sponsored this investigation
to establish whether EV71 infection is reaching epidemic proportions.
Because there are no data available on the past prevalence of EV71 in
Korea, it is difficult [at this stage of the investigation to define
whether there is an epidemic or not. Fortunately, so far there have been no
fatal cases attributable to EV71 infection in Korea. Genomic subtyping and
neutralizing tests are in progress.

[It is encouraging to know that the prevalence of EV71 is being
investigated in a systematic and scientific manner. In the longer term such
work should assist the identification and monitoring of strains with
particular pathogenic properties, information which is entirely lacking at
the present time. -Mod.CP
