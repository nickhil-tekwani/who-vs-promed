Local media reports that suspected equine influenza was discovered on
26 Oct 2007 in Bulgan Sum and Uyench Sum in Khovd Province, which
borders China's Xinjiang Province. Analysis by the province's
livestock infectious disease prevention agency[ies] confirmed that
equine influenza had occurred in the 2 Sums [districts] above. The
province has quarantined the areas of the outbreak. Quarantine
measures were adopted in neighboring Bayan-Olgii Province and
Govi-Altai Province, to prevent further spread of the disease. At the
same time, the disease prevention agency[ies] has urgently
distributed equine influenza vaccine for injection in horses in the
affected area. Up to now, about 600 horses have been infected with
equine influenza.

Equine influenza is a type of highly contagious respiratory disease.
It can cause death in colts and bodily weakness in mature horses. Up
to now no cases are known to have been transmitted to humans.

[Mongolia's eastern provinces Khovd (Hovd), Bayan-Olgii
(Bayan-Olgiy), and Govi-Altai (Govi-Altay) can be seen on the map at

On 5 Nov 2007, China submitted to the OIE (World Organization for
Animal Health) a report on outbreaks of equine influenza, caused by
the equine influenza virus A subtype H3N8, in 7 counties, namely
Altay, Burqin, Fuhai, Fuyun, Habahe, Jemnay, and Qinghe in the
Xinjiang province. The date of start of the outbreak was, reportedly,
9 Oct 2007. According to the Chinese newswire above, the disease was
discovered in neighboring Mongolia on 26 Oct 2007, namely weeks after
its start in Xinjiang.

Mongolia's annual reports to the OIE indicate that the disease has
been present continuously in the past and vaccinations were applied;
for a multiannual disease status (1996-2004), see
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/sit_pays_mald_pl.asp?c_pays=126&c_mald=64>.

In 2005, the disease (which is not notifiable in Mongolia) was
included in the list of "diseases present in the country; suspected
but not confirmed." An update, including vaccination data, will be
helpful.
