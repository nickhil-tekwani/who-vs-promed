LETTER TO US EMBASSY DID NOT HAVE ANTHRAX
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The 2 latest samples of nasal excretions -- according to the test results
of the Microbiological Lab of Athens University -- which the US Embassy
sent to the Center of Special Viruses Control (KEEL), were tested negative.
These 2 samples were sent to the KEEL in the framework of the
epidemiological check, performed on Embassy facilities and staff members.
It should be noted that the US Embassy has sent another 25 samples to the
KEEL over the last week, all of which tested negative.

US Department of State: Athens response to anthrax tests
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Richard Boucher, Spokesman Washington, DC -- Early the afternoon of 4 Nov,
the American Embassy in Athens received lab results confirming that
bacteria from a diplomatic mailbag that arrived at the embassy October 31
is not anthrax [_Bacillus anthracis_. The embassy then briefed the Greek
government.
The benign bacteria, not associated with disease, is a typical surface
contaminant.
The embassy has also been informed that a suspicious letter received last
week at the Souda Bay naval station has tested negative for anthrax.
