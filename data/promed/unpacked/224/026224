New lab results suggest inadequate refrigeration caused the outbreak of foodborne illness at the CNE [Canadian National Exhibition] linked to a Toronto bakery's maple bacon jam topping for the cronut burger, says Toronto Public Health [TPH]. Le Dolci, which supplied both the cronut bun and jam for the burger, has been allowed to reopen, but with conditions including additional food safety training, and supervised cleaning and sanitation.

"Our investigation suggests that inadequate refrigeration of the maple bacon jam at multiple points before serving to the customer (both at the Le Dolci preparation site and Epic Burgers and Waffles) would have allowed the [staphylococcal] bacteria to grow and produce the [entero]toxin that led to illness," TPH spokeswoman Kris Scheuer said in an email.

While the brown sugar and maple syrup results came back negative, the bacon tested positive, but for different bacteria. The bacterial toxin found in jam samples from both Le Dolci and Epic Burgers was actually produced from a different strain of _Staphylococcus aureus_ than that found in the bacon. "So the bacon is not to 'blame,'" Scheuer said.

By Wednesday morning, 4 Sep 2013, TPH had interviewed 250 people complaining of symptoms of foodborne illness after eating at the CNE. "At least 90 people who ate at Epic Burgers and Waffles between 16 and 20 Aug 2013 reported having specific symptoms consistent with _S. aureus_ food poisoning. Of those 90 people, 87 ate the cronut burger," said Scheuer.

Le Dolci closed voluntarily in the wake of the investigation. The bakery is not allowed to produce maple bacon jam for the time being, but could make it again in the future with TPH's approval of ingredient sources and tweaks to the production process. TPH will continue to monitor Le Dolci "to ensure adherence with the specified conditions and other food safety requirements," said Scheuer.

[Maintaining a cold chain is an integral part of food safety. Products that require refrigeration really do require refrigeration to prevent the overgrowth of potentially harmful bacteria, some of which are harmful because of a toxin that is produced prior to eating, such as this illness, and some of which cause illness by direct replication in the body, such as salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
