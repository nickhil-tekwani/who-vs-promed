A case of botulism has been confirmed in Iceland for the 1st time since 1983. The Public Health Institute of Iceland (Landlaeknir) revealed an adult began experiencing symptoms on 12 Jan 2020 with the illness confirmed a week later. Local health authorities, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (Mataelastofnun) and Matis, a government owned, non-profit, research company, are trying to find the source of the poisoning with no evidence as yet pointing toward food available on the market.

Botulism cases have only been reported in the country 3 times, 1st in 1949, when 4 people became ill after eating pickled beef, then in 1981, when a 4-person family became sick, and in 1983 when a mother and child became ill after eating meats.

Common causes are home-cooked foods such as meats, fish, vegetables and fruits, which are usually canned, pickled or fermented and often vacuum-packed.

Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food, but they can start as soon as 6 hours after or up to 10 days later. Botulism can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.
