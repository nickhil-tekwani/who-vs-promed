[1] Moderna vaccine
[A] Neutralization of variants
Date: Mon 25 Jan 2021

https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/25/moderna-vaccine-less-effective-variant/


Moderna is studying adding booster doses to its vaccine regimen after finding its COVID-19 vaccine was less potent against a coronavirus variant that was first identified in South Africa, the company said Monday [25 Jan 2021]. In lab research that involved testing whether blood from people who had received the vaccine could still fend off different coronavirus variants, scientists found that there was a 6-fold reduction in the vaccine's neutralizing power against the variant, called B.1.351, than against earlier forms of the coronavirus, Moderna reported.

There was no loss in neutralization levels against a different variant, called B.1.1.7, that was first identified in the United Kingdom. Both variants are thought to be more transmissible than other forms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Moderna said that despite the reduction in neutralizing antibodies against B.1.351, the antibody levels generated by its vaccine "remain above levels that are expected to be protective." Still, it said it was going to start testing whether adding a booster dose to its existing 2-dose regimen could increase the levels of neutralizing antibodies even further and that it was going to start investigating a booster specifically designed against B.1.351. "These lower titers [of antibodies against B.1.351] may suggest a potential risk of earlier waning of immunity to the new B.1.351 strains," Moderna said.

The announcement from Moderna gets at a nuance that scientists have been trying to stress as fears around vaccines and variants grew. Both the Moderna vaccine and the immunization from Pfizer-BioNTech produce such powerful levels of immune protection -- generating higher levels of antibodies on average than people who recover from a COVID-19 infection have -- that they should be able to withstand some drop in their potency without really losing their ability to guard people from getting sick. "There is a very slight, modest diminution in the efficacy of a vaccine against it, but there's enough cushion with the vaccines that we have that we still consider them to be effective," Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases official, said Monday [25 Jan 2021] on the "Today" show [US news and talk television program].

The coronavirus has been evolving throughout the pandemic, and scientists had expected that eventually, the virus would change so much that vaccines would need to be upgraded to better match dominant variants. But the appearance in recent months of the variants, which picked up mutations at much higher rates than the coronavirus was adding at the beginning of the pandemic, has moved up the date at which that might need to occur. Experts say they need to now figure out how much less effective the vaccines can get before upgrades are needed, and what the regulatory process for approving such tweaks would look like.

Pfizer and BioNTech scientists have already reported their vaccine holds up against B.1.1.7, though they have not reported data yet against B.1.351. But researchers have been more concerned about B.1.351 because it contains a different set of mutations that, at least in lab experiments, had already helped the virus evade some of the immune protection generated in people who had an initial COVID-19 case.

Some of those same mutations of concern also appear in a different variant first seen in Brazil, called P.1. [N.B. This variant has now been identified in the US in a traveler returning from Brazil. See section [3] below]

In the meantime, if mutations do arise that deliver a blow to the vaccines' strength, experts still say people should get them. Having some immune memory to the virus (which vaccines provide, almost like a substitute for an initial infection) is better than being completely vulnerable. You might still be able to get infected, and maybe even get sick, but giving your immune system even a small edge can reduce the chances you'll get seriously ill.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative infection of a global pandemic that has led to more than 2 million deaths worldwide. The Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine has demonstrated approximately 94% efficacy in a phase 3 study and has been approved under Emergency Use Authorization. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutations in the spike protein, most recently circulating isolates from the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and Republic of South Africa (B.1.351), has led to lower neutralization from convalescent serum by pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays and resistance to certain monoclonal antibodies. Here, using 2 orthogonal VSV and lentivirus PsVN assays expressing spike variants of 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, D614G-N439, mink cluster 5, B.1.1.7, and B.1.351 variants, we assessed the neutralizing capacity of sera from human subjects or non-human primates (NHPs) that received mRNA-1273. No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was detected in either case, however, reduced neutralization was measured against the mutations present in B.1.351. Geometric mean titer (GMT) of human sera from clinical trial participants in VSV PsVN assay using D614G spike was 1/1852. VSV pseudoviruses with spike containing K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G and full B.1.351 mutations resulted in 2.7 and 6.4-fold GMT reduction, respectively, when compared to the D614G VSV pseudovirus. Importantly, the VSV PsVN GMT of these human sera to the full B.1.351 spike variant was still 1/290, with all evaluated sera able to fully neutralize. Similarly, sera from NHPs immunized with 30 or 100Î¼g of mRNA-1273 had VSV PsVN GMTs of approximately 1/323 or 1/404, respectively, against the full B.1.351 spike variant with an approximately 5 to 10-fold reduction compared to D614G. Individual mutations that are characteristic of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants had a similar impact on neutralization when tested in VSV or in lentivirus PsVN assays. Despite the observed decreases, the GMT of VSV PsVN titers in human vaccinee sera against the B.1.351 variant remained at approximately 1/300. Taken together these data demonstrate reduced but still significant neutralization against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination."

Excerpts [edited]
"The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7 lineage) and in South Africa (B.1.351 lineage) has raised concerns due to their increased rates of transmission as well as their potential to circumvent immunity elicited by natural infection or vaccination. (Refs)

"B.1.1.7 variant has 17 mutations in the viral genome. Among them, 8 mutations are located in the spike (S) protein. 2 key features of this variant, the 69-70 deletion and the N501Y mutation in S protein, have generated concern among scientists and policy makers in the UK based on increased transmission and potentially increased mortality, resulting in further shutdowns. The 69-70 deletion is associated with reduced sensitivity to neutralization by SARS-CoV-2 human convalescent serum samples (Kemp et al, 2021). N501 is one of the 6 key amino acids interacting with ACE-2 receptor (Starr et al, 2020), and the tyrosine substitution has been shown to have increased binding affinity to the ACE-2 receptor (Chan et al, 2020).

"The B.1.351 variant emerged in South Africa over the past few months, and, similar to the B.1.1.7 variant, increased rates of transmission and higher viral burden after infection have been reported (Tegally et al, 2020). The mutations located in the S protein are more extensive than the B.1.1.7 variant.

"Three of these mutations are located in the RBD [receptor binding domain]. As the RBD is the predominant target for neutralizing antibodies, these mutations could impact the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies already approved and in advanced development as well as of polyclonal antibody elicited by infection or vaccination in neutralizing the virus."

Discussion excerpts [edited]
"No significant impact on neutralization was observed from either the full set of mutations found in the B.1.1.7 variant or the N501Y and the 69-70 deletion. Although these mutations have been reported to lessen neutralization from convalescent sera, sera from the Phase 1 participants and NHPs immunized with mRNA-1273 were able to neutralize the B.1.1.7 variant to the same level as the D614G virus.

"Consistent with other recent reports assessing neutralization of the mutations found in B.1.351 (Wang et al, 2021), there was a 7-fold reduction in neutralization from sera collected from participants vaccinated with mRNA-1273 when the 3 mutations found in the RBD (K417N-E484K-N501Y) were present in the VSV-based pseudovirus assay. Importantly a 6.4-fold reduction was observed when the full set of mutations, including those in the N-terminal domain (NTD), were included.

"The emergence of strain variants and the ability of the virus to partially overcome natural or vaccine-induced immunity does serve as a call to action, pointing to the need for continued efforts to vaccinate with the currently approved mRNA regimens to prevent the emergence of future variants that may further evade immunity. In addition, active viral surveillance and testing of protection against new viral variants must continue, and if warranted new vaccine efforts must be engaged to protect against breakthrough strains. The mRNA platform allows rapid design of vaccine antigens that incorporate key mutations. Strain-matched vaccines can be developed in response to these variants, either to understand how we might evolve the vaccine-induced immune response through boosting or to assess the cross-protection provided by a primary series."

[C] Variants: Moderna booster
Date: Mon 25 Jan 2021 12:39 PM EST

https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/25/moderna-booster-shot-vaccine-covid-variant-462131


Moderna will develop a COVID-19 booster shot designed to be more effective against emerging strains of the coronavirus, the Massachusetts manufacturer announced Monday [25 Jan 2021]. New strains of the coronavirus have emerged in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil, along with concerns that they could make vaccines less effective, and be more transmissible or deadly.

Moderna's announcement comes days after the US government's top infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, said that the Biden administration is "paying very close attention" to the variants. "There are alternative plans if we ever have to modify the vaccine," said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, at a White House briefing Thursday [21 Jan 2021].

Moderna is testing 2 booster-shot options -- one specifically aimed at the South African variant and another to broadly fight new mutations. Laboratory research using blood from people and monkeys who had received the company's vaccine found that the UK variant did not appear to reduce the production of neutralizing antibodies. But the South African variant showed a 6-fold reduction, the company said. Other research has suggested the UK variant is more transmissible than previous versions of the virus. On Fri [22 Jan 2021], a UK government science advisory board said there "is a realistic possibility" that the UK variant is also more deadly.

Moderna said the development of the booster is a precaution because its already-authorized 2-dose regimen still offered substantial protection against the UK and South African strains in the lab study. "As we seek to defeat the COVID-19 virus, which has created a worldwide pandemic, we believe it is imperative to be proactive as the virus evolves," Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement. The company is starting human trials for the South African booster shot "out of an abundance of caution," he added.

Moderna conducted the laboratory study in collaboration with NIAID and has published the research online in bioRxiv ahead of peer review. The company said it will submit the study to a peer-reviewed journal. [See section [B] above]

[D] Moderna vaccine booster

The scientific and pharmaceutical race to keep coronavirus vaccines ahead of new virus variants escalated Monday [25 Jan 2021], even as a highly transmissible variant first detected in Brazil was discovered in Minnesota.

Moderna, the maker of one of the 2 authorized coronavirus vaccines in the United States, announced it would develop and test a new vaccine tailored to block a similar mutation-riddled virus variant in case an updated shot becomes necessary.

The effort is a precautionary step. Evidence released Monday [25 Jan 2021] suggested that the Moderna vaccine will still work against 2 variants of concern that emerged in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The plan highlights that the scientists who responded with unprecedented speed and success to develop coronavirus vaccines are already moving to address new challenges. It also amplifies the urgency of getting as many people immunized with current vaccines as quickly as possible.

"We need to double down on public health measures. The less a virus spreads, the less it's going to mutate," said Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "We need to get as many people vaccinated with the current vaccine that we have as we possibly can ... and prepare for the potential eventuality that we might have to update this vaccine sometime in the future."

The success of 2 remarkably effective coronavirus vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech in record time last year [2020] provided breathing room and hope, even as the pandemic surged. But the detection of variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil in recent weeks raised immediate concern.

Those variants, each with a different assemblage of mutations, spread much more easily. But some of the mutations in each variant drew special concern because they sit in the spiky proteins that dot the outside of the coronavirus and have been the key target for vaccines and therapeutics.

The British variant has been detected in the United States at least 130 times, and Minnesota public health officials announced Monday [25 Jan 2021] that they had detected the Brazilian variant, which some reports suggest may be able to evade natural immunity, allowing people to become reinfected. The Minnesota Department of Health said the case involved a resident with recent travel history to Brazil.

The emergence of the variants raised the specter that the current generation of vaccines might be rendered obsolete before they have even been fully rolled out.

The emerging evidence, though still partial, puts some of those fears to rest. The study released Monday [25 Jan 2021], before peer review, suggests the Moderna vaccine will probably protect against variants first detected in Britain and South Africa. A Pfizer-BioNTech study released last week [week of 18 Jan 2021] found that its vaccine probably protects against the British variant. Those findings add to a growing body of experiments testing antibody-rich blood serum from vaccinated people against new mutations, with largely encouraging results.

But the study of the Moderna vaccine contains a clear warning sign: Although the disease-fighting antibodies appeared to work against the South African variant, that efficacy was diminished [the level of antibody produced was lower but was still within the protective range. - Mod.MPP]. That prompted the company to design a new potential vaccine that could be added to the current 2-dose regimen if needed, which will soon be tested in human trials. Moderna will also test a 3rd dose of its current vaccine to see whether revving up a person's immune response against the original version of the coronavirus could help protect against the variant.

"The virus is changing its stripes, and we will change to make sure we can beat the virus where it's going," Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in an interview. "The unknown is: Would we feel it's necessary to do that, would public health officials want this at that point or would they still be comfortable? What we're trying to do is create an option."

Janet Woodcock, acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said in an interview Monday [25 Jan 2021] that the agency understands the urgency of dealing with the potential problems posed by new variants. She said the utility of vaccines, monoclonal antibody treatments, and some coronavirus tests "could be undermined" if there is a big enough change caused by a new coronavirus strain.

Woodcock said the FDA is in talks with manufacturers about how to deal with the threat. New FDA policies on how to test for efficacy involving a new variant, she said, would be made public because of intense interest.

Woodcock stressed that the variants problem showed why a global response is so important. Unless the coronavirus is eradicated everywhere, she said, it will remain a threat to the United States and other countries.

The emerging evidence shows the need to deploy current vaccines as quickly as possible, a campaign that has accelerated markedly in the United States over the past week, with more than 1 million shots given each day since last Tuesday [19 Jan 2021], according to Washington Post data. It also underscores the importance of vigilance, to fully investigate any cases of the coronavirus that develop in people who are vaccinated so that there is an early alert if the virus shows it can break through the immunity conjured by vaccines.

A growing number of scientists anticipate the potential need for periodic reboots of the coronavirus vaccines, similar to an annual flu shot, to deliver a boost of immunity tailored to closely match new variants.

The vaccines "are still going to be highly effective, and they are probably the most important tools we have to get this thing under control," said Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge's Institute of Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease, who found in a study of older adults that the immune response triggered by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was modestly less effective against the British variant. "With flu, we need to adapt the vaccines. We can see that already. The companies do realize there is a problem in the longer term, and they will deal with it just as we have done with flu every year."

In the Moderna study, antibody-containing blood serum taken from people and monkeys who received the vaccine was tested against "pseudoviruses" that are engineered to contain the spike protein present in the U.K. and South African variants. The serum was able to block both viruses and remained above a threshold of efficacy for the South African variant, despite a diminution in effectiveness.

Barney Graham, deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health and an author of the study, said more experiments are forthcoming that will help guide public health experts' thinking. But he speculated, based on his knowledge of other viruses, that the evidence so far is that the current vaccines will still work.

"I think we're okay for now, but [the virus] is changing," Graham said. "It means that if some of these mutations accumulate to a certain extent, you may end up with a new strain that's not protected by the vaccine, so all of this is being done out of an abundance of caution."

There have also been reminders that although the 1st 2 vaccines worked remarkably well, success is not guaranteed in vaccine development. Merck, a longtime vaccine company, made the surprising announcement Monday [25 Jan 2021] that it was abandoning 2 vaccine candidates after early human studies showed that both triggered inferior immune responses compared with other vaccines and natural infection.

The Merck effort started later and significantly lagged other companies, and the nation's vaccination plan wasn't heavily reliant on a possible Merck shot. The 2 authorized vaccines use a novel approach that had never been used in an authorized vaccine, while Merck employed a more traditional approach.

Late last year [2020], Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline announced they were redesigning their vaccine after a 1st version did not cause a robust immune response in older adults. After the setback, their candidate is not expected to be available until the end of this year [2021].

Public health officials are eagerly awaiting the data from Johnson & Johnson's trial, which could come in the next week. That data may suggest how a vaccine performs against the variant because since some of the trial was conducted in South Africa.

The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are especially well suited to rapid updates. Both use genetic material called messenger RNA that acts much like software, instructing the body's cells how to build the spike protein found on the outside of the coronavirus. To update the vaccines, scientists have to rewrite the software to block the new target.

Hoge said the regulatory pathway for a new version of the vaccine is not entirely clear, but he does not anticipate having to run large trials with tens of thousands of volunteers, as was done to show the 1st vaccine was effective and safe. Instead, he said he anticipates a rebooted vaccine could be tested in hundreds or thousands of people to establish safety and that the right immune response is being triggered. It would be possible, Hoge said, to begin making a new vaccine at a large scale by the summer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is orchestrated by the spike (S) glycoprotein that contains an immunodominant receptor-binding domain (RBD) targeted by the largest fraction of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 challenge. SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the 501Y.V2 and B.1.1.7 lineages, harbor frequent mutations localized in the NTD supersite suggesting ongoing selective pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs to protective immunity.

Introduction
------------
Integrating cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), binding assays, and antibody escape mutants analysis we define a SARS-CoV-2 NTD antigenic map and identify a supersite recognized by potent neutralizing mAbs. We show that these mAbs exhibit neutralization activities on par with best-in-class RBD specific mAbs and efficiently activate Fc-mediated effector functions. We also identify immunologically important variation of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD suggesting that the S glycoprotein is under selective pressure from the host humoral immune response. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle that a highly potent NTD mAb provides prophylactic protection against lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge of Syrian hamsters paving the way for evaluating this class of mAbs in the clinic.

[Also see the Veesler lab on Twitter (https://twitter.com/veeslerlab) for more on this important finding. Since antibody against the N-terminal domain highly neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, this provides a therapeutic target outside the RBD. And even more important, monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal domain was protective in vivo in hamsters. This is in spite of the fact that "Antibodies targeting the RBD account for 90% of the neutralizing activity in COVID-19 convalescent sera (Piccoli et al, 2020)." The investigators demonstrated that "low doses of antiNTD mAbs provide remarkable prophylactic activity in vivo, comparable to best-in-class RBD-specific mAbs... (Tortorici et al, 2020), consistent with their potent in vitro neutralizing activity." This line of research may lead to new tools to fight COVID-19 infection.

[3] USA (Minnesota): Brazil variant
Date: Tue 26 Jan 2021 12:30 AM GMT+1
Source: The Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/brazil-coronavirus-variant-minnesota/2021/01/25/bff5a8de-5f53-11eb-9430-e7c77b5b0297_story.html


Minnesota officials announced Monday [25 Jan 2021] they have identified a person infected with a highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus that has been spreading at alarming rates in recent weeks in Brazil. This is the 1st report in the United States of the P.1 variant, which has been of particular concern to scientists as they have observed the disastrous surge in infections in the Brazilian city of Manaus.

One research study published in the journal Science [see reference below] estimated that 76 percent of the Manaus population already had been infected by the coronavirus. That should have put Manaus close to herd immunity. The new surge has raised fears that the P.1 variant has mutations that allow it to evade the human immune system. Evidence to support this hypothesis remains limited.

The Minnesota Department of Health said the case there involved "a Minnesota resident with recent travel history to Brazil," and the variant was detected through genomic sequencing of random blood samples as part of a surveillance program. The person, a resident of the Twin Cities metro area, reported feeling sick the 1st week of January [2021] and was tested [9 Jan 2021] . The health department said the person has been in isolation, and the department is continuing to investigate the case.

"This isn't surprising. It's a very difficult development, but at the same time not unexpected," Michael T Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and an adviser to President Biden's coronavirus task force, said in an interview. All viruses mutate, and there are countless variants in circulation. The Brazil variant is one of 3 that have drawn particular global attention. The other 2 were first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, and are known to virologists as B.1.1.7 and B1.351.

Although scientists know quite a bit about the UK variant, the Brazil variant "is probably the one causing the most concern among people watching this," William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, said Monday [25 Jan 2021]. "It is fair to say that P.1 is the object of very, very serious attention and concern among epidemiologists. We don't know why it has been so successful in Manaus."

The UK variant -- already spreading in the United States -- has become the dominant strain in southern England, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it could become dominant in the United States by some point in March [2021] if it outcompetes other strains. Minnesota has detected 8 cases involving the UK variant, officials said Monday [25 Jan 2021].

The South Africa variant has not been identified in the United States.

"These cases illustrate why it is so important to limit travel during a pandemic as much as possible," Minnesota state epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield said in a statement released by the health department.

There is some overlap in the mutations in the 3 variants, but they arose independently and, along with other variants under review, provide a vivid reminder that the coronavirus is not a static target for vaccines and the human immune system. Most scientists believe the vaccines will remain effective against the variants, a belief bolstered by research released Monday [25 Jan 2021] by Moderna, maker of one of the 2 vaccines authorized in the United States.

British scientists said late last week [week of 18 Jan 2021] that they have preliminary evidence suggesting that the UK variant may be about 30 percent more lethal than the more common strain of SARS-CoV-2. The researchers emphasized that this is a new variant and that they are still trying to understand its clinical effects. The scientific community has not produced evidence that the South Africa or Brazil variants cause a different level of disease severity.

But the Brazil and South Africa variants have incited particular concern among scientists because they contain mutations that may allow the virus to evade the effects of some antibodies, such as the monoclonal antibodies developed as therapies for patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.

"This is the new reality of COVID," Osterholm said. "This is now the dawning of the age of the variants."

It was only a matter of time before this new variant was identified in the USA. The virus is an excellent traveler on boats, trains, buses, and airplanes. It is also only a matter of time before new domestic variants will be identified in the USA, having developed here as the nature of the virus. Hence the need to continually monitor for new variants among the viruses isolated from cases in each of the states. - Mod.MPP]

[*There appears to have been a major adjustment of the European region reports so that the European regional total and the global cumulative totals are inflated from yesterday's (24 Jan 2021) data -- Tukey went from 1 609 990 to 2 429 605 cumulative cases suggesting a review of cases as previously done. - Mod.MPP]

[The 100 million case mark has been reached with more than 2.1 million reported deaths. A somber milestone.

Weekend reporting artifact is still seen with a 34.5% drop in global reported cases since Thu 21 Jan 2021, a 39.1% drop in reported deaths; at the country level, there was a 63.1% drop in reported cases by Germany; a 61.9% drop by Mexico; a 60.0% drop by South Africa; a 52.7% drop by Brazil; a 41.4% drop by the UK; a 36.7% drop by Spain; a 35.4% drop by India; a 33.5% drop by Argentina; a 19.1% drop by the USA; and a 14.6% drop by Indonesia.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (159 472), Spain (93 822), and Brazil (28 364), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 435 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 24 Jan to late 25 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (6 countries -- down from 12 yesterday, 24 Jan 2021) include the USA, Spain, Brazil, the UK (22 195), Russia (19 290), and Colombia (12 261). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 45 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 4 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 22.0% decrease in daily reported cases and a 6.9% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases have decreased to over 511 000 newly confirmed infections daily in the past 24 days hours -- almost 250 000 less than Thursday (21 Jan 2021) -- and over 100 million cumulative reported cases with over 2.14 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of decreasing reports over the weekend especially but also over the past 2 weeks. There is a definite increase in reporting in some African countries, with 4 countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. It does appear as though the major lockdowns in Europe and the Americas are impacting transmission. - Mod.MPP]
