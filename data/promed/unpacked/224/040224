New Caledonia: First Cases of Local Transmission of Dengue Virus Type 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2001, the Pacific region has been exposed to dengue virus type 1
(DEN-1 virus) and major outbreaks have already occurred in many
Islands. One of the more severe was in French Polynesia. Because New
Caledonia has frequent aerial connections with Tahiti, imported cases were
seen as early as June 2001, mainly in Noumea -- New Caledonia's largest
city -- but up to recently, no local transmission focus was described.
In spite of strong anti-vector measures, some cases of local transmission of
DEN-1 virus have emerged since mid-April 2002. The 26 confirmed cases are
fairly scattered over the Noumea urban area, but several foci have been
clearly identified.
In terms of outbreak response, it would appear still to be useful and
effective to carry on with peri-focal control work over a reasonably wide
area, in conjunction with systematic spraying, particularly in Noumea. For
this to be successful, early patient identification is essential and the
work of the sentinel network is vital. This vigilance must also be exercised
by all practitioners, including those outside Noumea, as the risk of
dissemination of the virus is high during the current period of school
holidays. At the same time, more public awareness work is needed on what
people can do to contribute to vector control, and all available means
should be used in this regard.

Malaysia: Outbreak in Taman Setiawangsa
---------------------------------------
With 65 people in Taman Setiawangsa down with dengue fever in 20 weeks,
Wangsa Maju MP Datuk Zulhasnan Rafique will join the local authorities in a
massive clean-up designated Gotong-Royong Perdana. The day-long exercise,
scheduled to be held on 26 Jun 2002, is expected to involve more than 1000
residents and workers from Kuala Lumpur City Hall and Alam Flora Sdn Bhd.
The event will include talks on health, briefings on how to prevent the
breeding of mosquitoes in compounds of houses, schools and shops, health
checks and exhibitions. Zulhasnan, who chaired an hour-long meeting with
representatives of schools, City Hall, residents' associations, commercial
complexes, hawker [street trader] associations and mosque committees, said
the campaign would help control the breeding of the _Aedes_ mosquito vector
in Taman Setiawangsa.
"This is a serious problem. Last year, there were 103 cases reported but
this year, within less than half a-year, there are already 65 cases. "With
the help of City Hall's Health Department, we will distribute leaflets."
City Hall Health Department director Datuk Dr Zainol Ariffin, who was also
present, said it would sponsor 1000 units of the "Mosquito Larvae Trapping
Device" to be distributed to residents.

Cuba: Dengue Mosquitoes Reappear in Havana
------------------------------------------
The independent news agency CubaNet reports that new foci of _Aedes aegypti_
have appeared in the 10th of October district of Havana. Since 21 May 2002,
sanitation workers have been spraying 2 streets in the area, and the
Ministry of Public Health is giving priority to trash collection there.

Cuba: Weekly Mosquito Spraying Decreed For Rental Housing
---------------------------------------------------------
Rental housing units in central Havana will be sprayed weekly against the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito from now on, since public health authorities say
the bulk of dengue cases in the area are attributable to migrants from
eastern Cuba living in such units.
Havana has been subject to an intensive mosquito-control campaign during the
last 3 months, focusing on the mosquito [vector] that transmits dengue
fever.
The latest measure provides that renters who don't cooperate with the
spraying efforts will be fined 1500 pesos. Spray crews are informing
residents on what day and approximately at what time they will visit each
household.

Venezuela: Dengue/DHF Alert
---------------------------
Due to the dramatic increase in the number of cases of several infectious
diseases [malaria, measles and dengue fever] in several regions of the
country, the Venezuelan health authorities have issued an epidemiological
alert.
According to the Ministry of Health and Social Development epidemiological
report for the 20th week of the year (12 -18 May 2002), the current
situation regarding the incidence of dengue fever is alarming, with a
reported 18 330 cases in the whole country, 9 percent of which correspond to
dengue hemorrhagic fever. This number represents an increase of 7784 cases
(73.8 percent higher) compared to the same period last year. The states with
the largest number of registered cases are Zulia (6542), Lara 2002), Merida
(1893), and Tachira (1135).

Central America: PAHO Reports Increased Dengue in Central America
----------------------------------------------------------------
[As a consequence of] rain storms and floods in recent months, the number of
dengue fever cases has been on the rise in Central America this year, with
6526 cases registered between Jan and May 2002, the Pan-American Health
Organization (PAHO) said on Sat 1 Jun 2002.
By comparison, some 7080 people in Central America were affected by the
mosquito-borne tropical disease last year [2001]. Of the 6526 cases reported
this year, 169 people suffered dengue hemorrhage fever [DHF], including 2
deaths, the PAHO report stated.
According to the PAHO report, the meteorological change caused by the
climatic phenomenon of "El Nino" could create better breeding [conditions]
for the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, the vector of dengue fever. The health
authorities of Central American countries have launched campaigns against
the mosquito, whose reproduction has been supported by downpours and floods
in the region.
