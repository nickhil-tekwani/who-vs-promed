A seven-year-old girl is dead and at least 13 people from Delft, near Cape
Town, have
been admitted to hospital in a critical condition with food poisoning.
On Tuesday, members of three Delft families arrived at the day hospital
there with
respiratory problems, some so serious they had to be put on ventilators and
transferred to ICU at Tygerberg hospital.
Doctors said patients told them they had eaten minced meat.
A Delft doctor said one of the patients, [a 7-year-old girl] was "very bad"
and on
Tuesday night died in an ambulance on the way to Tygerberg hospital. Her
unconscious mother was in Tygerberg in a serious condition.
