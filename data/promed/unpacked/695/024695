[From February to March 2020, Bulgaria reported 8 outbreaks of HPAI subtype H5N8. The animals affected were domestic birds, and the outbreaks were located in the province of Plovdiv (where the current outbreak is also located). The event summary and updated map is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=33324.

"Since the beginning of 2020, outbreaks of H5N8 have been continuously reported in several European countries in poultry and/or wild birds. Hungary reported 21 new H5N8 outbreaks in this reporting period. Ongoing outbreaks are also still continuing in Hungary and in South Africa in addition to outbreaks recurring in Iraq. It is more likely that the source of infection in these outbreaks is contact with wild birds and followed by limited local spread.

"Veterinary authorities in the affected countries have responded to contain outbreaks in poultry with stamping-out measures, heightened surveillance, and recommendations to poultry owners to increase biosecurity.

"The OIE standards, and the transparency of reporting through the OIE's World Animal Health Information System, provide the framework for veterinary services to implement effective surveillance, reporting, and controls for avian influenza. Wild-bird surveillance can indicate periods of heightened risk, and at these times measures to improve on-farm biosecurity may reduce the likelihood of exposure of poultry."

To date, no human cases of infection with HPAI H5N8 have been reported. - Mod.CRD
