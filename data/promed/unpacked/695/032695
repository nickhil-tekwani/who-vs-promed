[According to the "Surveillance Report on Animal Disease Notification and Surveillance," published in November 2020 by the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority MAST, "scrapie [in Iceland] has been endemic since 1878. A decision was made in 1986 to start an eradication programme. On farms where scrapie is detected, all sheep are culled. Areas where scrapie has been detected are kept under special surveillance for 10 years. Samples are taken annually from sheep at slaughter and sheep displaying clinical signs compatible with scrapie."

A table with the number of samples analyzed for scrapie since 2000 can be seen in the mentioned report, available at https://www.mast.is/static/files/skyrslur/ad_notificationsurveillance_iceland_nov2020.pdf.

Regulation pertaining to the eradication of scrapie and compensation for culling in Iceland is available at https://www.mast.is/static/files/library/Regluger√∞ir/651_2001ReglugerdUtryminguariduveikiogbaeturEN1505.pdf. - Mod.CRD
