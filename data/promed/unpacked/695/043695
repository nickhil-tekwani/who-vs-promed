New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak Location: Ramat Magshimmim, Golan, Hazafon [Northern]
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 May 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1300 / 2 / 0 / 2 / -
Affected population: a dairy farm in the Golan Heights. 700 milking cows and 600 heifers. The 2 affected animals were 18 and 8 months old. Clinical symptoms: lumps on multiple parts of the skin, fever, enlarged lymph nodes.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0.15 / 0 / 0 / 0.15
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: airborne spread, vectors
Epidemiological comments: the farm is about 4 km from the border with the neighbouring country. Probably, the virus has been introduced by flying insects.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); quarantine; selective killing and disposal; zoning; disinfection; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; screening; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; control of vectors

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Kimron Veterinary Institute, Virology Laboratory (national laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / real-time (PCR) / 3 Jun 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The previous, wide-scale lumpy skin disease (LSD) event in Israel started in July 2012, similarly on the Golan (North-East Israel, bordering Syria and Lebanon), where the current outbreak is located. Stamping out policy was not applied and the disease continued into 2013, spreading westwards and then southwards in Israel. In March 2013, compulsory cattle vaccination, using 2 vaccine strains, was applied countrywide and the incidence of disease dropped abruptly, eventually declared resolved in September 2013. The event included a total of 232 outbreaks; about 1000 head died or had to be culled. Links to all follow-up reports and a summarized interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=12157.

During the following years, LSD vaccination became obligatory in Israel and its coverage consequently reduced. Due to the privatization process, the State Veterinary Services are not engaged anymore with the vaccination performance which has been handed over to private practitioners. The vaccine currently used is the live-attenuated Neethling strain vaccine, manufactured by OBP (South Africa). It was selected after wide-scale field trials for its efficacy and safety, compared to another candidate vaccine.

LSD in cattle is endemic in Egypt since decades and has been reported during recent years from several other countries in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, N. Cyprus, and the Palestinian Authority. LSD's presence in Syria has been suspected since 2012, remaining unreported to present (see 20150527.3389044, 20160724.4365199).

The affected, large dairy operation in Ramat Magshimmim, 3-4 km (1.8-2.5 mi) from the Syrian border, was last vaccinated in May 2018. It may be assumed that most animals on the farm are still immune: the 2 affected animals are young.

Revaccinations there, and on all cattle farms on the Golan, are scheduled for the coming days. - Mods.AS/CRD
