German Company Admits Defect in Infant Food
------------------------
After the deaths of 2 Israeli children because of a severe vitamin
deficiency, the German manufacturer of infant formula admitted Tuesday that
a kosher, soy-based product it sells in Israel was missing an ingredient
necessary to sustain infant life.
The company, Humana Milchunion, which is based in Everswinkel, Germany,
said that because of human error its Remedia Super Soya 1 product, which is
popular in Israel and Jewish communities elsewhere because of its strict
kosher certification, contained only a fraction of the Vitamin B-1, also
known as thiamine, that is needed to prevent diseases like beri-beri, which
can be fatal in infants.
"This is a one-time sequence of unfortunate circumstances," said Albert
Grosse Frie, spokesman for the Humana Milchunion's board, in a statement
published on the company's Web site.
The Israeli police said Monday that they had begun an investigation of the
matter. "We are investigating the circumstances of the deaths of the babies
and the lack of vitamin B-1 in the cans of formula," said a police
spokesman, Ofir Sivan. "The entire issue is under investigation."
Humana, which said Monday it was investigating the case, added that tests
had shown that the product contained between 29 and 37 micrograms of
vitamin B-1 per 100 grams, less than 1/10 of the advertised amount.
"These values are significantly lower than the product's declared value of
385 micrograms per 100 grams of prepared food," a statement issued by
Humana said. "They are also below the European Union guideline value of 120
micrograms per 100 grams of food."
Humana traced the error to faulty analyses of 2 forerunners to the Super
Soya 1 product, which led to an incorrect assumption that supplemental
levels of thiamine were unnecessary. "Because of an omission in the
procedural checks, the independent analysis was not carried out fully," it
said.
The Humana formula is sold in Israel by Remedia Ltd., which is a subsidiary
of H. J. Heinz.
The Israeli police raided the offices of Remedia in Tel Aviv on Monday
after the Justice Ministry announced a criminal investigation into the
deaths of 2 children because of severe vitamin B-1 deficiency.

Infant formula officials under investigation
------------------
German infant formula maker Humana remains surrounded by controversy as
conflicting reports fail to confirm responsibility for the modifications to
its soy formula, linked to the death of 3 babies in Israel.
The company yesterday admitted that its formula contained significantly
less vitamin B1 (thiamine) than stated on the label. Humana said tests had
shown that the product contained between 29 and 37 micrograms of vitamin
B-1 per 100 grams, less than 1/10 of the labelled amount.
This is a one-time sequence of unfortunate circumstances," said Albert
Grosse Frie, the Humana CEO.
However other reports suggest that the missing vitamin, responsible for
severe thiamine deficiency in 17 babies, leaving 3 dead and causing
neurological and other problems in the others, may have been a conscious
change to the formula.
There is confusion over responsibility for the error. According to the
Jerusalem Post, Humana said that it believed that soybeans contained
sufficient quantities of the vitamin -­ which had been included in the
formula until April. Others say the vitamin was removed at the request of
the Israeli importer Remedia. However Remedia officials claim they had
asked only for a minor change in the fat composition of the formula and
that they were completely unaware of the significant removal of the vitamin.
The paper added that any change in formula requires a new license from
Israels health authorities, and since neither firm told the ministry of
the new composition, the sale of the product was in fact illegal. Remedia
officials are to be questioned today by a police investigation.
The UKs Food Standards Agency has advising parents about the kosher infant
formula, not believed to be available in the UK, but possibly brought into
the country by a specialist importer or parents after visiting Israel.
It has recalled 2 Remedia products, Tzimchit Super Formula and Junior
Tzimchit Super Formula. The agency has asked local authorities to ensure
that if these products are being stocked by shops selling kosher goods,
they are removed from sale. A kosher milk product called Super Formula
Junior sold by Remedia in the UK is not affected.

German prosecutors open probe on Israel baby food
------------------
German prosecutors said on Wednesday they were investigating the makers of
a baby food formula at the centre of an Israeli probe into the deaths of 2
babies.
Prosecutors in the western city of Bielefeld said they opened
investigations after Humana GmbH, makers of baby formula Remedia Super Soya
1, said on Tuesday the product was deficient in vitamin B-1, which is vital
for maintaining infant health.
A spokesman for prosecutors said they were investigating the company on
preliminary suspicions of causing death through negligence as well as
breaches of food safety laws.
He said the German probe, which follows a separate investigation by Israeli
police and at least 2 private lawsuits, was focusing on 3 company executives.
"The investigation has been opened into the head of product development,
the head of quality control and the laboratory chemist on the basis of
their company positions," he said.
The move came as the North Rhine-Westphalia state consumer protection
ministry said it was extending testing on Humana products to cover the
company's entire product range.
A Humana spokesman confirmed that the investigations were taking place and
said the company would cooperate fully. He said Humana was likely to make
personnel changes and may need to make improvements in its quality management.
"You can be sure that there will be personnel changes at the beginning of
next week," he said.
On Tuesday, Humana, part of the Humana Milchunion, Germany's second largest
producer of milk products, said the kosher Super Soya 1 product
manufactured for the Israeli market had less than 1/10 of the amount of
vitamin B-1 advertised.
Israeli police have already launched an investigation into suspicions that
defects in the product led to a B-1 vitamin deficiency that created acute
health problems in at least 9 babies. 2 have died.
The company blamed faulty analyses of previous product recipes and the
failure of procedural checks to spot the error for the lack of vitamin B-1
in the kosher product.
One family in Israel has filed a lawsuit in a Tel Aviv court seeking $230
million in damages and naming Humana and the Israeli Health Ministry. A
separate suit was filed by another Israeli family for some $26 million in
compensation.
A lack of vitamin B-1 can cause a disease called beriberi, characterised by
inflammatory or degenerative changes to the nerves, digestive system and heart.

[The newswire reports detail the confusion surrounding how the product was
released with below-acceptable levels of Vitamin B1 (thiamine) for
infants. While there are infants that have to be fed infant formula, the
international effort "Breast is best" seems to be highlighted by this
incident. We await further information on the extent of this problem both
within Israel as well as internationally. - Mod.MPP]
