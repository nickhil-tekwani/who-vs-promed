The cholera epidemic that has been sweeping across Cuba since last June 2012 has spread to the provinces of Santiago de Cuba, Guantanamo, and Holguin, with dozens of people hospitalized and some municipalities in critical situation, reports from the island the independent news agency "Hablemos Press".

According to a report of the agency's director, Roberto de Jesus Guerra Perez, sources in the public health sector and residents of the eastern zone confirmed the proliferation of the epidemic, and pointed out that the province of Guantanamo could be declared in quarantine.

A resident in the city of Guantanamo confirmed that there are about 206 cases of cholera in the province. Figures revealed by this citizen were obtained from an employee of the Ministry of Public Health that requested their identity not be revealed, says Hablemos Press.

The progress of these diseases could compel the Cuban health authorities to declare the province of Guantanamo in quarantine, "but none of this has been reported to the population," says the source. According to the report, public health workers and doctors have intensified their work, and inspected homes and overpopulated areas with the goal of preventing its spread again the epidemic, according to reports from the provinces of Las Tunas, Granma, Santiago de Cuba, and Holguin.

Another resident in Guantanamo said "some schools, workplaces, and shops are putting knobs with chlorine and soap so that the people wash their hands, the only measure they have taken so far."

In Las Tunas Province, the agency has confirmation of at least 3 persons infected, who remain hospitalized at the Provincial Hospital "Ernesto Guevara". "The serious cases are being taken to the observation room of the (hospital) Guevara, where a police officer, or a security officer, is placed at the entrance of the room so that nobody can enter and remove information," said a resident of Las Tunas. The same source added that in the Sports School "Carlos Leiva", of Las Tunas, 12 students were found infected with cholera, and were hospitalized immediately.

The wet conditions, promote the proliferation of cholera. Hurricane Sandy caused extensive flooding in the provinces of Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Las Tunas, and Granma, which contributed to the spread of the epidemic.

In Santiago de Cuba, more than 50 cholera patients are admitted to the Hospital "Ambrosio Grillo". In the Maya and San Luis villages, more than 200 cases have been confirmed in the last few weeks, according to an activist resident of the Vista Alegre locality and promoter of an independent project that helps children in her community.

Other reports from independent sources mention at least 15 cases of cholera in the municipalities of Sagua de Tanamo, Holguin, and Moa, in Holguin province. Also, last Sunday, 18 Nov 2012, several cases of cholera were corroborated in the capital and in the province of Mayabeque.
