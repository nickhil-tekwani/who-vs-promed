ENTERIC DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, HUMANS (02)
=========================================
Date: Tue, 18 Mar 97 10:31:00 EST
From: William B. Baine <wbaine@ahcpr.gov>
In the United States, systematic salmonellosis surveillance has been based on
bacterial isolates (not clinical cases) reported to CDC by state
laboratories. To estimate the incidence of clinical salmonellosis from
surveillance data, CDC exploited large outbreaks of disease, particularly the
1965 epidemic in Riverside, California (Am J Epidemiol 1971;93:33-48). The
incidence in an outbreak in question was estimated by extrapolating the
attack rate in the study sample to the estimated population at risk. Then
the Salmonella Surveillance System was interrogated to determine how many
isolates of the incriminated serotype were reported from the affected area,
excluding isolates obtained in connection with the outbreak investigation
itself. The ratio of presumably outbreak-related reported isolates recovered
from specimens apparently obtained for clinical purposes to estimated
clinical cases was about 1:100. This method involves obvious simplifying
assumptions. It would be less satisfactory for campylobacter infections than
for salmonellosis to the extent that serotyping of salmonella confers greater
specificity than does speciation of campylobacter in identifying outbreak-
related cases among background prevalence.
