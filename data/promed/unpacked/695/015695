This sounds more like a case of cross-reactivity than autoimmunity. Or am
I splitting hairs here? The normal immune response to one of the 11
proteins of the Coxsackie B4 virus just happens to cross-react with a
protein found in pancreatic islets. This seems to me to be more accurately
described as accidental. It is my understanding that autoimmunity results
from the "escape" of sequestered clones which recognize human antigens.
Regardless, the discovery is significant and lends support to an old
hypothesis that all disease, including organic disease, is the result of a
microbe. The recent ProMED-mail discussion regarding _Chlamydia
pneumoniae_ and its possible link to atherosclerosis is but another example.

It is probably a little risky to say that "diabetes..... is caused by a
virus that is spreading across the country by cross-infection between
schoolchildren", as stated in [the news report on ProMED-mail of 2 June
1998. The etiology of type 1 diabetes is still not clear, and Coxsackie B4
virus seems to be only one of the elements in this etiologic puzzle.

The newspaper article by Jonathan Leake and Mark Macaskill regarding
diabetes contains several factual errors and reaches a conclusion that
cannot be supported by the bulk of scientific evidence.
Type 1 diabetes is a serious condition affecting children. The tragedy of
type 1 diabetes must be acknowledged. However, for perspective, an
analysis of the U.S. NHANES database gives an estimate for a U.S.
population representing 170.5 million (M) civilian, non-institutionalized
American adults and would suggest that 7.9 million have diabetes by
history, an additional 4.7 million have a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dl, but
are unaware that they have diabetes, and 11.6 million have impaired fasting
glucose (fasting glucose 110-125 mg/dl). Of the adults with diabetes by
history, approximately 90% appear to have type 2 diabetes. The bulk of the
other 2 groups almost certainly do not have type 1 diabetes.
Therefore, only a very small number of patients with diabetes have type 1.
A virus has never been seriously considered to be a possible cause of type
2 diabetes. Viral etiologies have been suggested for type 1 diabetes
(present in less than 10% of adults with diabetes), but genetic etiologies
are also possible. Alternatively, type 1 diabetes may require both genetic
susceptibility and viral exposure. It is not clear that the viral exposure
must be a single virus. It is possible that a susceptible individual if
exposed to one of multiple viral species may later develop type 1 diabetes.
The bulk of the increased prevalence of diabetes globally appears to be
from type 2 diabetes associated with increasing obesity, sedentary
lifestyle, television, etc.
The characterization of diabetes as a growing epidemic caused by a virus
spreading across the UK or anywhere else on the globe cannot be supported
by the available facts. There are enough growing viral epidemics spreading
across the globe (e.g. HIV). We don't need to add diabetes to the list.
