[1] Nebraska: 1st AFM case

A child in the Sarpy/Cass Health Department area had the 1st confirmed case of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in Nebraska. AFM is a condition that causes muscle weakness. The child was hospitalized and later released. The case was reported to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).

One additional suspected case, also in the Sarpy/Cass Health Department jurisdiction, is undergoing further testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Another reported case in Douglas county was not confirmed after a thorough review by the CDC. The patient met some, but not all of the criteria for being a confirmed AFM case.

"AFM is a rare but serious condition that affects mostly children, and we've been watching closely for cases in Nebraska over the last 4 years," said State Epidemiologist for DHHS Dr. Tom Safranek. "There is still a lot to learn about AFM and more study is needed. State and local health departments nationwide are working with federal partners to investigate cases and the possible causes."

AFM is not a new condition, but there has been an increase in cases nationwide since 2014. From August 2014 through October 2018, there have been a total of 440 confirmed cases of AFM in the US.

DHHS started surveillance for AFM in 2014 after cases appeared in Colorado and made it a reportable disease in 2016. The department has shared information on recognizing, managing and reporting potential cases of AFM with health care providers and local health departments across the state.

DHHS also listed these facts about AFM:
- AFM is a condition that generally causes sudden muscle weakness. Symptoms include sudden weakness in the arms or legs. Some people also experience drooping of the eyelids or face, difficulty moving eyes, slurred speech, or difficulty swallowing.
- If parents see potential symptoms of AFM in their child, they should contact their health care provider promptly.
- Experts are working to determine the exact cause of AFM. There is no specific treatment for AFM or proven prevention strategy, but washing hands, covering your cough and staying home if you're sick can help avoid illness.

[2] CDC update
Date: Tue 27 Nov 2018

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-6433015/Paralysing-polio-like-disease-spreads-31-states.html


The mysterious, rare 'polio-like' disease blighting the US has now spread to 31 states, sickening at least 116 children. And yet, officials still have no idea what causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), nor how to treat or prevent it.

The poorly understood illness, which can cause paralysis and, in rare cases, prove deadly, has struck Colorado the hardest, followed by Texas.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently investigating a further 170 cases of people with tell-tale symptoms of AFM.

There has already been more than 3.5 times as many cases as last year [2017], but doctors remain baffled as to what is causing the illness.

The CDC put out its most recent figures on [Tue 27 Nov 2018], showing there have been 286 reports of people suffering from acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in 31 states, with 116 of those cases confirmed.

More than 90 percent of people affected by the illness are under 18 and the average age of patients is 4.

It is believed to be caused by a combination of viruses and children usually first show signs of a fever and a cough for three to 10 days.

[CDC is concerned about AFM, a serious illness that we do not know the cause of or how to prevent it.
- CDC is investigating the increase in AFM in 2018. As of November 2018, 31 states have reported confirmed AFM cases.
- Even with an increase in cases in 2014, 2016, and now in 2018, AFM remains a very rare disease (less than one in a million).
- CDC is intensifying efforts to understand the cause and risk factors of AFM.

It is always important to practice disease prevention steps, like washing your hands, staying up-to-date on vaccines, and protecting yourself from mosquito bites. - Mod.UBA]
