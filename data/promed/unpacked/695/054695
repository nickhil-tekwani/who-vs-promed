While Australians have in the past cared for flying foxes caught in
fences or the like, and this commonly involves caring for infant bats
in the Spring, I have never heard of anyone breast feeding bats, nor
can I imagine such a contribution provides any further assistance in
the matter other than to illustrate Australians as eccentric
egalitarian mammals. The case at hand was [the most recent patient
died on Sunday - Mod.CHC] of a mother certainly, though she
contracted the virus probably when protecting her child from the
attack of a flying fox. When infected with the virus, the bats tend
to be rather erratic in behaviour and more aggressive. This has
previously been (and possibly presently) misdiagnosed as lead
poisoning which is not uncommon in bats living near urban
environments as the particulate pollution carrying lead coats their
fur/hair.
My understanding is that the earliest isolated virus is held by the
Anton Breinl Centre of James Cook University, identified in a frozen
bat initially diagnosed as lead poisoning with encephalopathy.
Returning to the case at hand, a further salient feature is that the
patient was offered post-exposure vaccination shortly after the
exposure and refused to accept [it]. This has fueled a media frenzy
about wider use of pre- and post-exposure vaccination which
presumably will filter out to foreign countries to generate more
alarmist and marginally relevant reports based on minimal fact.

[No doubt there is a media frenzy. Today alone I have spoken with
newspaper and magazine reporters, radio and TV newspeople, and two
kooks, all from Australia. I asked them why they are asking me all
these questions, the Australian scientific community is as competent
as any group to provide accurate and up-to-date information about
Ballina virus. Seems to me that if the scientific community there
would make themselves available for honest, detailed, and
depoliticized information, I wouldn't have to be on the telephone all
day.
The premature death of a human is always a sad affair. However,
taken in context of the larger picture, we are only talking about two
deaths, fewer than occur each day in Australia from physical abuse,
accidental poisoning, and politics. What the Australian scientific
community needs is more funds to do the research at which they are
experts. They seem to be doing an excellent job thus far, given
other priorities they must have.
If there are facts that ProMED-mail has not posted, by all means send
them to us and we will post them at once. For example, we did not
know until today that tissues from archived bats in Melbourne are
being tested by PCR for Ballina virus. We did not know that there
are humans with antibody to Ballina virus but no history of severe
and compatible illness. Instead, we receive messages (the day before
she died) saying "The patient is doing nicely, thank you, so why are
you stirring this pot? - Mod CHC]

Just a trivial, but perhaps important, correction. You wrote:
"Bats are common in Australia, particularly the large fruit bats
which inhabit two thirds of the country. As their natural habitat is
being destroyed by man, the bats are moving closer to urban areas.
Colonies have been found in botanic gardens outside Melbourne and
Sydney."

Megabats (pteropids) have always been an integral component of
suburbia here. In fact, cities have been built in what were (and
continue to be) the fruit-bats' foraging territories, and they simply
refuse to be pushed out. In Brisbane (and in Sydney), fruit-bats
swooping around fig, palm and other ornamental, food-bearing trees in
central city streets and parks are a normal feature of the city
nightlife. The Melbourne and Sydney botanical gardens are in the
centres of those cities, not in the outer suburbs! It would be
almost impossible (and perhaps ecologically crazy) to eradicate
these important and beautiful animals, although rednecks and farmers
are always on the lookout for any excuse to attack them
(flame-throwers and dynamite have been used against some roosts
here).

In summarising the current state of knowledge in the most recent case
of Bat Lyssavirus [i.e., Ballina virus - Mod.CHC] in Queensland, Dr
Calisher stated that "Australians love their flying foxes". My view
would be that it might have been more accurate to say that some
Australians love their flying foxes.
While not having any objective data from a Gallup poll, my guess
would be that a majority of the populace, in particular those in
urban areas, think Australia would be a better place without flying
foxes. It certainly would be quieter and cleaner and those of us who
grow fruit in our backyards would be better nourished!
Flying foxes gather in enormous numbers, hanging almost motionless
from trees during day with their wings folded. They migrate from
these 'camps' at twilight, flying in loose formation, and typically
following river courses. They then disperse, raiding local orchards
and fruit-bearing trees of virtually any description. In populated
areas their incessant screeching can be heard during times normally
set aside for sleeping (humans, that is). Further, flying foxes seem
to have few social graces, to the extent that their semi-liquid
droppings are an eyesore on the sides of homes -- even burning paint
from coated surfaces.
In summary, many of us think flying foxes contribute little to
Australia's wonderful lifestyle.
(This rather light-hearted communication is not intended to deflect
from our concern for the patient who is now seriously ill with
lyssavirus infection.)

[Unfortunately, the patient died. This message might have been meant
to be lighthearted but I didn't take it that way. Australia is no
different from other countries where humans live. Natural landscapes
are changed, flora destroyed, fauna isolated into "reserves", native
people treated as barriers to progress. I am struck by the irony of
Captain Cook and his men considering the place inhospitable.
Although they did not recognize it, the places they so described were
not inhospitable to native humans, trees, bushes, grasses, goannas,
insects, birds, or macropods; it was inhospitable to them. Therefore,
in the great tradition of the human species, and in an effort to make
the place more hospitable to themselves, Australians have altered the
environment so that it is less inhospitable to Caucasians and some
others. However, it is now more inhospitable to native humans,
trees, bushes, grasses, goannas, insects, birds, and macropods.
The sentiments expressed in this message should give one reason to
pause and ask what the hell we are doing? One more thing: If they
could be asked, I'd like to know what flying foxes think about our
contribution to their wonderful lifestyle.
Unless we receive data regarding the emergence of Ballina virus, this
string is cut - Mod.CHC]
