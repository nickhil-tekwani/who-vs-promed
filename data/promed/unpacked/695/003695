Anthrax vaccinations started in south
-------------------------------------
Combined Reports health workers said on Monday that they had started a
vaccination campaign to avert an anthrax outbreak in the aftermath of
flooding across southern Russia.
The surging waters, which have claimed at least 91 lives and forced tens of
thousands from their homes over the past 2 weeks, have also washed open 12
burial grounds for cattle infected with anthrax. "Because burial grounds
with anthrax-infected carcasses have been swept away, people are under
theoretical threat of becoming infected," Nadezhda Zhilina, head of the
Gossanepidnadzor epidemiological agency, was quoted as saying by Interfax.
"But there have been no unfortunate incidents so far."

[I have requested further information from colleagues in Moscow. Cases of
anthrax are known to occur among livestock following flooding and erosion
of burial sites. A similar situation preceded the 1997 outbreak in
Victoria, Australia, for example. The above account indicates, however,
that the authorities are vaccinating people. When the flood waters go down,
they would be wise to vaccinate any and all surviving livestock. - Mod.MHJ]
