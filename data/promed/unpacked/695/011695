Bird-flu Expert Calls For Changes In Early-warning System
----------------------------------------------------------
The international science community is not doing enough to track the
many avian influenza viruses that might cause the next pandemic, a UC
Davis researcher says. Global surveillance is critical for
identifying and tracking potential pandemic viruses such as highly
pathogenic H5N1. But the current surveillance strategy in wild birds
is piecemeal and risks missing important virus sources or subtypes,
Walter Boyce writes in a commentary.*

Boyce says scientists must take several steps to catch avian
influenza viruses before they catch us:

-- Go where the H5N1 virus lives: Surveillance has focused too
heavily on Europe and North America, where few wild birds are
infected. To really understand the role of wild birds in spreading
H5N1, more surveillance should be done in places where the virus is
endemic, such as China, southeast Asia and Africa, Boyce says.

-- Characterize all of the influenza viruses they collect:
Currently, the narrow focus on H5N1 misses other viruses that also
pose pandemic risks.

-- Share samples and data more promptly: Whether caused by
regulatory hurdles or researchers' concerns about intellectual
property rights, a reluctance to share hampers health officials'
ability to track and respond to potential pandemic viruses. Boyce
recommends that the scientific community set a standard of releasing
data no more than 45 days after it is generated.

Boyce, a UC Davis professor of veterinary medicine, is co-director of
the USD 18.5 million Center for Rapid Influenza Surveillance and
Research (CRISAR). The center, supported by the National Institutes
of Health, is charged with tracking viruses in wild birds in the
United States and Asia. Adapted from materials provided by University
of California-Davis.

[The original paper is worth reading in full. As an epidemiologist I
was struck by three paragraphs:

*** "... we must unravel the role of
wild-bird species in spreading H5N1 by improving our wild-bird
surveillance and research efforts. It is clear that wild aquatic
birds are a natural reservoir of influenza viruses, although it is
possible that H5N1 persists in a wild-bird species we wouldn't
normally suspect. But we don't know whether H5N1 viruses are endemic
in wild-bird populations or if infections in wild birds represent
spillover from poultry. And although movement of infected poultry
plays a pivotal part in spreading H5N1 to new areas, we continue to
debate, year after year, the risk to poultry posed by migrating wild
birds.

*** "To move beyond debate and come up with definitive answers, we
must investigate H5N1 in the areas where virus transmission actually
takes place. Until recently, most wild birds tested for H5N1 had been
sampled in regions of Europe and North America where infections are
rare or absent. Dead birds, such as swans, have been conspicuous
sentinels of H5N1 infection in Europe, triggering rapid responses to
prevent the spread to poultry. But we don't know how these birds
acquired their infections, and the presence of infected dead birds
doesn't necessarily mean that virus transmission is occurring, or
will occur, in the area where they are found.

*** "It is live birds, not dead birds, that shed the virus and pose a
threat. Because our surveillance efforts have struggled to find
infected live birds in non-endemic regions, it is essential that we
shift sufficient resources and efforts to evaluate H5N1 transmission
in wild birds in known endemic areas such as southeastern Asia,
China, Indonesia and Africa."

I am reminded of a class given me in 1964 by my Tulane epidemiology
professor Ken Newell on the praticalities of investigating an
outbreak and deciding where to go 1st. He strongly advised going
1st to look at the outlying cases because the spread factors are
few there and probably are among the most important. In the centre of
an epidemic one is presented with a score or more of possible
explanations and no easy way of sorting them out. His advice has
helped me many times. With the insights from the outer investigations
one is better prepared when diving into the middle. However Walter
Boyce's comments are very opportune and well worth considering in
these confusing times. - Mod MHJ]
