["The Lao People's Democratic Republic has a poultry population of approximately 20 million, with 80 percent owned by smallholder farmers. Most farmers raise chickens, but other types of poultry are also raised including ducks, pigeons, geese and a variety of caged birds. Since there are no large commercial poultry slaughtering establishments in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, processing is done primarily by owners or traders with small basic facilities.

The 1st outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1) in poultry was in January 2004 in Vientiane Capital, where 45 separate locations were affected, resulting in the death or culling of 155 000 birds. Since then, almost yearly outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry have been confirmed." Source: http://www.wpro.who.int/laos/topics/avian_influenza/en/. - Mod.CRD
