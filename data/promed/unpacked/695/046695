Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source:
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the National Monkeypox Emergency Operations Centre.

Case definitions:
Suspected case
- An acute illness with a fever greater than 38.3 deg C [100.9 deg F], intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to 3 days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of the hand.

Probable case
- A case that meets the clinical case definition and is not laboratory confirmed but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed case.

Confirmed case
- A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.

Contact
- Any person who has been in direct or indirect contact with a confirmed case since the onset of symptoms, that is, contact with skin lesions, oral secretions, urine, faeces, vomitus, blood, sexual contact, sharing a common space (anyone who has been in proximity with or without physical contact with a confirmed case).

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only.

[Monkeypox cases continue to increase in Nigeria. There are 15 new cases in epi week 31 (1-7 Aug 2022). The monkeypox virus is endemic in Nigeria. Cases occur sporadically throughout the year and across the country except in the far northeast. The report above does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.1% [11/359] is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade (now clade I) but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade (now clade 2 (IIa).

This report or previous ones do not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. As noted earlier, monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ (giant pouched rat) and _Graphiurus_ (African dormice). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily.

There is an account of a boy who appeared in a clinic on 22 Sep 2017 who was the 1st case of monkeypox in Nigeria in 38 years. Dr Ogoina said that "over the next few months, he and his colleagues detected more than 20 additional cases at their clinic. The outbreak in Nigeria began to grow rapidly. Cases cropped up in counties not just near this one boy but all over. Suddenly, we were seeing cases appear across the country," Ogoina says.

"The virus seemed to be spreading further and faster than expected. And it wasn't infecting kids, but rather men in their 20s and 30s. "Young, active men were getting monkeypox," Ogoina says. "It was very unusual at that time."

"These men also didn't fit the typical profile for monkeypox patients. They weren't hunting or handling animals but instead were middle-class men, living in busy, modern cities. Ogoina wondered: "Why isn't it affecting children? Or females? Or the elderly? Why are we seeing only young men, ages 20 to 40?" (In fact, Ogoina and his colleague eventually figured out that the young boy didn't even catch the virus from an animal but rather from a male relative in his household.)

"And the rashes that affected these patients weren't in the typical places where monkeypox struck. Instead of being on their face and extremities, the blisters occurred around their genitals. "They had very extensive genital lesions. Very, very extensive," Ogoina says."
