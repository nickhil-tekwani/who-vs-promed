A total of 119 people have been hospitalized in a mass poisoning
incident at the Lesnaya Skazka children's recreation center in the
Novgorod region, officials said on Wed 15 Aug 2007. There are adults
among the patients.
"24 of them are in medium grave conditions, 18 in satisfactory
condition, and another 77, though pronounced healthy, remain under
medical supervision. There is no threat to their life," it was added.
The report on the mass poisoning came in on Tue 14 Aug 2007. There
were 124 people at the recreation center at the time.
Experts believe that a food poisoning of bacteriological etiology
occurred. On that day, children ate yogurt and stewed fruit, and the
latter might have caused the affliction. The source of the disease
will be found anyway, as all food samples have been sent to Veliky
Novgorod for analysis. Representatives of the consumer health
watchdog and others have already been to the recreation center on a
fact-finding mission.

[The etiology of this foodborne outbreak is not clear and more
information is needed. Knowing the incubation period from eating to
illness, if fever is present and what specific gastrointestinal
symptoms occurred would be helpful. If the incubation was short, as
implied by the posting, especially if it were less than 12 hours, the
likelihood of a preformed toxin disease (such as staphylococcal food
poisoning) is high, especially if there was no or minimal fever.
Disease related to chemicals or viruses is also possible. An attack
rate of 119 out of 124 or 96 percent is impressive.
The Novgorod region is in the western part of European Russia. It can
