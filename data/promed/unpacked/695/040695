The death of a 5-year-old child from the coastal area of Poonthura [Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala] has triggered panic over the possibility of scrub typhus. Health officials however declined to confirm saying that it was difficult to diagnose, although they too suspect this fever.

"Scrub typhus is not so common in Trivandrum [Thiruvananthapuram]. We have come across many suspected cases, but nothing has been diagnosed beyond doubt. This type of fever is more common in Calicut, Kannur, Wayanad, and Kasargod [Kerala]. The child from Poonthura is only a suspected case but it was not detected completely.

However reliable sources in Trivandrum Medical College said a few cases had tested positive for the fever but were unable to give out the details. "Even though this is a very rare disease, a few cases have been found positive to be scrub typhus over the past 4 months," said an official from Medical College.

Scrub typhus is one of the most common infectious diseases of rural southern Asia, south eastern Asia, and the western Pacific, caused by the microorganism _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. Experts from Trivandrum Medical College say that almost 12 states in India have reported an increase in the number of the disease in the past 6 years.

Also known as tsutsugamushi fever, scrub typhus is treatable but it can get out of hand when diagnosis is delayed or the incorrect antimicrobial agent is used. "If detected early, we can cure it with doxycycline or azithromycin but if not diagnosed, there are chances that the patient may die of circulatory failure or related complications," added the district medical officer [DMO].

This fever was first identified in Kerala in 2006 in the Malabar areas. "It is difficult to diagnose through clinical symptoms. Doctors usually look for scabs or black scars caused by arthropod bite. The Weil-Felix test can confirm the infection, but sometimes it might show falsely positive due to some urinary tract infections," said the DMO.

Scrub typhus occurs most commonly among people in contact with overgrown terrain, forest clearings, reforested areas, and new settlements in certain areas of Kerala. The disease is seen after rains when arthropod carriers that live in shrubs are disturbed.

[Scrub typhus is an acute febrile illness characterized by a typical eschar, generalized lymphadenopathy, skin rashes, and vague non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, headache, and cough. It is characterized by focal or disseminated vasculitis and perivasculitis, which may involve the lung, heart, liver, spleen, and central nervous system. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a serious complication of scrub typhus; encephalitis, interstitial pneumonia, myocarditis and pericarditis, acute renal failure, acute hepatic failure, and acute hearing loss can also occur in patients with scrub typhus. In a review of 297 cases of the disease (Lee CS, Hwang JH, Lee HB, Kwon KS: Risk factors leading to fatal outcome in scrub typhus patients. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2009; 81: 484-8; http://www.ajtmh.org/content/81/3/484.long), a case-fatality rate of 6.7 percent was reported.

Weil and Felix described the classical assay for rickettsial antibody detection in 1916. The methodology took advantage of heterophilic (cross-reacting) antigens of members of the genus _Rickettsia_ and several species of the Gram negative bacillus _Proteus_. In the Weil-Felix test, bacteria of _Proteus vulgaris_ OX-19 agglutinate with sera of those infected with typhus group organisms as well as from the Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) organism _Rickettsia rickettsii_. Cells of _P. vulgaris_ OX-2, on the other hand, agglutinate with sera from individuals with spotted fever infection, except RMSF. The OX-19 agglutination is seen in epidemic typhus, but usually not in Brill-Zinsser recrudescent disease. _P. mirabilis_ OX-K can be similarly used in the serological diagnosis of scrub typhus. Because of the relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of this test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including one for complement fixation antibodies. - Mod.LL
