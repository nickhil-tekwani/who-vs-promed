Regarding Salmonellosis - Ecuador: (CT, TU) religious party Archive Number: 20210825.8622183:
I am not understanding the statement that "The epidemiologist mentioned that before eating, it is necessary to verify that [the foods] are in good condition through the smell and taste." While spoilage organisms typically give rise to foul smell and taste, they are not frequently the cause of a foodborne illness unless a high level of organism loading occurs. I am concerned that the post will lead persons to believe that if food does not have a foul smell or taste that it is safe to eat, when in fact poor handling, cross contamination, and unsafe temperature holding for more than a few hours in total are frequently the cause of foodborne illnesses which can cause sickness and even death; often there are no off odors or tastes in foods which may be deadly.
