Former Page Three model and now reality TV star Samantha Fox is being
treated for the potentially fatal disease rabies after being savaged
by a cat. The star -- most recently on our screens last year [2009]
on I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here -- was bitten while holidaying
on the paradise island of Koh Samui in Thailand with her partner and
manager Myra Stratton. Sam, 44, explained that she'd been feeding the
stray cats that gathered around a restaurant where they ate when one
attacked her.

She told the Sunday Express: "I love animals, especially cats, but
over there, they're treated like rats and are left to fend for
themselves. I ended up feeding a lot of them, giving them bits of
shellfish after dinner. This one was laying on my feet, and I thought
we were getting on really well, so I went to stroke him, but he bit
me so hard, it went down to the bone."

Sam continued that when she'd told the restaurant owner what had
happened, she was told that the tabby and white feline -- which she
took a picture of -- was known locally as a "crazy cat," meaning it
had rabies.

The star explained she was then immediately given anti-rabies jabs at
the island's Lamai Medical Clinic and is still getting injections,
despite having flown back to the UK 10 days ago. She added: "The
treatment for rabies makes you feel sick and horrible, though, really
fluey and shaky." However, Sam, who lives in North London with Myra
and their 4 cats, insists the experience hasn't put her off animals.
She said: "I'm still potty about animals, cats, dogs, foxes,
whatever."

The last recorded death from rabies in the UK was a woman in Northern
Ireland who was bitten by a rabid dog in South Africa in 2008.
Sufferers develop a raging fever, blinding headaches and a fear of
water. Experts warn that it can take weeks or even months between
receiving a bite or a scratch and developing symptoms, by which time
it may be too late for treatment, so medical help should be sought as
soon as possible after any animal-inflicted injury.
