Bird flu has been reported in 2 more provinces in Vietnam; Yen Bai Province
in the northern mountainous region and Quang Tri in the centre, the Animal
Health Department reported yesterday [8 Dec 2005].
The latest outbreak killed 500 ducks in a household in Quang Tri's Gio Linh
District late in November 2005, forcing the farmer to cull a total of 5000
birds.
Later tests confirmed that the ducks had the H5N1 virus. The department
also said yesterday that avian flu has been detected in a number of poultry
farms in Son La, Thanh Hoa and Ninh Binh provinces, all previously hit by
outbreaks.
The outbreak has now affected 15 provinces and cities in Vietnam, while 5
provinces have since been declared free of bird flu after not seeing
outbreaks for 21 days.
The World Health Organisation in Vietnam launched a website on bird flu
yesterday, providing updated information in Vietnamese and English on
national and global statistics as well as protection and control measures.
"A lack of information on avian influenza is helping fuel the spread of the
virus in Vietnam," said Dr Hans Troedsson, WHO Representative in Vietnam.
"The website provides an important 24-hour link to information and will
help people take measures to control the spread of the virus and protect
themselves, their families and communities from this very serious threat."
The website, <http://www.un.org.vn/who/avian>, also provides useful links
to other sites for information on bird flu, including the Ministry of
Health, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the Food and
Agriculture Organisation, the World Health Organisation (Geneva and
Manila), the World Organisation for Animal Health, the US Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention, Ministry of Public Health in Thailand, and
the Centre for Health Protection in Hong Kong.
42 out of 93 infected patients have died from the virus in Vietnam.
