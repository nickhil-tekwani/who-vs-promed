UNDIAGNOSED LIVESTOCK DEATHS - AFGHANISTAN (02): FAO RESPONSE

Obviously this and other similar reports which purport to signal the
re-emergence of rinderpest in Asia after an absence of nearly 5 years
-- and approaching 8 years in the case of Afghanistan -- are a matter
of grave concern for the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme and
demand investigation.
Such newspaper reports are in fact not that uncommon, and we do
routinely investigate as part of FAO's global monitoring system.
While we would be very surprised if it was rinderpest that had
sparked these reports, by following up and refuting the presence of
rinderpest we gain confidence [that rinderpest is still absent].
Obviously authoritative refutation is important to reassure other
countries in the region [that it is safe to] abandon rinderpest
vaccination and embark on OIE accreditation of freedom from
rinderpest. In this particular case we have made contact with
colleagues in the Afghan Department of Veterinary Services and in
NGOs working in the field. Investigations are continuing, but we have
been informed that there is no indication that rinderpest is
involved. It appears that the disease events concern primarily small
ruminants, and there are reports of outbreaks of FMD in cattle, sheep
and goats and PPR [peste des petits ruminants] in sheep and goats,
both diseases being a perennial problem in Afghanistan.
One NGO which operates Veterinary Field Units in Badakshan and
supports the government veterinarian in Faizabad reported about 2000
cases of PPR in their operating region in February, and about 30 000
doses of PPR vaccine were administered. Staff of a FAO Regional Trust
Fund project focusing on disease surveillance will be following up in
Afghanistan in the near future.
It is reassuring to have this indication that a system does exist
which would publicise rinderpest were it to be present, despite the
fact that official veterinary services are grossly underfunded in
Afghanistan.

[The expedient and detailed response of Dr Roeder is gratefully
acknowledged. Thanks are due also to FAO's Dr Juan Lubroth for his
help.
It is relieving to note that the nearly 8-year absence of rinderpest
in Afghanistan, remarkably eradicated within the efforts of GREP, is
expected to continue. Results of the epidemiological investigations
into the current animal health situation will be appreciated. -
