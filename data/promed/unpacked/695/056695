An outbreak of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection occurred in Taiwan in 1998.
The clinical spectrums and laboratory findings for 97 patients with virus
culture-proven EV71 infections were analyzed. Eighty-seven percent of the
patients were younger than age 5 years. Hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome
occurred in 79% of the children and central nervous system (CNS) involvement
in 35%, including nine fatal cases. The predominant neurological
presentations were myoclonus (68%), vomiting (53%), and ataxia (35%). Brain
stem encephalitis was the cardinal feature of EV71 CNS involvement during
this outbreak. Magnetic resonance imaging and pathological findings
illustrated that the midbrain, pons, and medulla were the target areas. EV71
brain stem encephalitis can present either with cerebellar signs and an
initially mild, reversible course or with overwhelming neurogenic shock and
neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) resulting in a fatal outcome. Brain stem
encephalitis that progressed abruptly to neurogenic shock and NPE was
indicative of poor prognosis in this epidemic. Early aggressive treatment
and close monitoring of the neurological signs are mandatory to improve the
chance of survival.
