Two new cases of enterovirus infection with severe complications have been confirmed in Taiwan, according to a press release of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) on [Tue 22 May 2018].

As the weather is turning warmer, enterovirus activity is expected to increase. Taiwan CDC urged the public to wash hands with soap and water frequently, rest at home when sick, and clean and sanitize their household with bleach regularly. The agency added that pregnant women, newborns and children are advised to avoid contact with infected individuals to prevent contracting enterovirus.

The 2 new enterovirus cases respectively are a newborn boy and a 3-year-old girl who both reside in northern Taiwan, the agency said.

"The newborn was confirmed to have contracted echovirus 11 and developed severe complications. As of now, the baby is still hospitalized for treatment," Taiwan CDC said.

"The 3-year-old girl sought medical attention at a hospital after she subsequently developed hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), herpangina, vomiting, fever, myoclonic jerk and drowsiness," the agency said. "After further evaluation, the case was confirmed to have contracted enterovirus 71 and developed severe complications. Fortunately, the case has recovered and been discharged from the hospital after treatment."

According to the surveillance data compiled by Taiwan CDC, thus far this year [2018], a cumulative total of 7 enterovirus cases with severe complications have been confirmed, which is higher than that during the same period last year [2017] and the year before [2016].

In addition, Taiwan CDC said that as enterovirus infection progresses fast, children below the age of 5 are at increased risk of developing severe infection. If a child in the family develops prodromal symptoms of complications such as flaccid paralysis, limb weakness, drowsiness, disturbed consciousness, inactivity, myoclonic jerk, continuous vomiting, tachypnea, and tachycardia, please ensure the child receives medical assistance at a large hospital as soon as possible, the agency said.

[Enterovirus cases have been reported from Taipei Taiwan in April 2017 [Human enterovirus - Taiwan: alert 20170418.4978387], and earlier, with health alerts issued to the general public to observe proper hygiene to reduce disease transmission. The enteroviruses are spread from person to person by coughs, sneezes, or by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus on them. Therefore, practicing good personal hygiene -- washing hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and water -- is the best way to prevent from getting and spreading the infectious disease.

However, most people infected with non-polio enteroviruses do not get sick, or present with mild illness, like the common cold. Infants, children, and teenagers are more likely than adults to get infected and become sick because they do not yet have immunity (protection) from previous exposures to the viruses. Adults can get infected too, but they are less likely to have symptoms, or their symptoms may be milder. Symptoms of mild illness may include: fever; runny nose, sneezing, cough; skin rash; mouth blisters; body and muscle aches.

Some non-polio enterovirus infections can lead to:
- viral conjunctivitis;
- hand-foot-mouth disease;
- viral meningitis (infection of the covering of the spinal cord and/or brain);
- viral encephalitis (infection of the brain);
- myocarditis (infection of the heart);
- pericarditis (infection of the sac around the heart);
- acute flaccid paralysis (a sudden onset of weakness in one or more arms or legs);
- inflammatory muscle disease (slow, progressive muscle weakness)

Infants and people with weakened immune systems have a greater chance of having these complications. People who develop myocarditis may have heart failure and require long-term care. Some people who develop encephalitis or paralysis may not fully recover. - Mod.UBA
