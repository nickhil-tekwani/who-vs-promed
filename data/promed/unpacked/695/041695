Acute respiratory disease associated with adenovirus serotype 14 -- 4
States, 2006-2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
(Adenovirus serotype 14 (Ad14) is a rarely reported but emerging
serotype of adenovirus that can cause severe and sometimes fatal
respiratory illness in patients of all ages, including healthy young
adults. In May 2006, an infant in New York aged 12 days died from
respiratory illness caused by Ad14. During March-June 2007, a total
of 140 additional cases of confirmed Ad14 respiratory illness were
identified in clusters of patients in Oregon, Washington, and Texas.
53 (38 percent) of these patients were hospitalized, including 24 (17
percent) who were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs); 9 (5
percent) patients died. Ad14 isolates from all 4 states were
identical by sequence data from the full hexon and fiber genes.
However, the isolates were distinct from the Ad14 reference strain
from 1955, suggesting the emergence and spread of a new Ad14 variant
in the United States. No epidemiologic evidence of direct
transmission linking the New York case or any of the clusters was
identified. This report summarizes the investigation of these Ad14
cases by state and city health authorities, the US Air Force, and CDC
(US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). State and local
public health departments should be alert to the possibility of
outbreaks caused by Ad14.

New York
--------
In May 2006, a fatal case of Ad14 illness occurred in New York City
in an infant girl aged 12 days. The infant was born after a full-term
pregnancy and uncomplicated delivery. She was found dead in bed,
where she had been sleeping. The infant had been examined 3 days
after birth and noted to have lost weight but was otherwise healthy.
The next week she had decreased tears with crying, suggesting early
dehydration. Physical activity and feeding progressively decreased
during the week before her death.

Postmortem tracheal and gastric swabs from the infant were sent to
the Wadsworth Center laboratory of the New York State Department of
Health, where adenovirus was detected by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). Adenovirus also was isolated by culture, confirmed by
immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and typed as Ad14 by antibody
neutralization assay. Analysis at CDC identified the same unique
genetic sequences in this isolate as were later identified in the
Ad14 isolates from the 3 2007 clusters.

Autopsy and histologic findings at the Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner in New York City included presence in the lung of chronic
inflammatory cells with intranuclear inclusions, consistent with
adenoviral bronchiolitis and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Investigation by the New York City Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene has not identified any other local cases of Ad14 illness.

Oregon
------
In early April 2007, a clinician alerted the Oregon Public Health
Division (OPHD) regarding multiple patients at a single hospital who
had been admitted with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia during 3 Mar-6
Apr. A total of 17 specimens were obtained from patients; 15 (88
percent) yielded isolates that were identified by CDC as Ad14.
Through retrospective examination of laboratory reports from the 3
clinical laboratories in the state that have virology capacity and
the Oregon State Public Health Laboratory (OSPHL), OPHD identified 68
persons who tested positive (by culture, PCR, or IFA) for adenovirus
during 1 Nov 2006-30 Apr 2007. Isolates from 50 (74 percent) of these
patients were available for further adenovirus typing at either CDC
or OSPHL. Of the 50 patient isolates, 31 (62 percent) were identified
as Ad14, and 15 (30 percent) were identified as another adenovirus
type. [Theses data are presented as a Figure in the original text.
The frequencies of the non-Ad14 viruses are roughly proportional to
the Ad14 frequencies. The non-Ad 14 serotypes present are not
identified individually. - Mod.CP] 4 (8 percent) did not test
positive for adenovirus.

Among 30 Ad14 patients (that is, all but one) whose medical charts
were reviewed, 22 (73 percent) were male; median age was 53.4 years
(range: 2 weeks to 82 years). 5 cases (17 percent) occurred in
patients aged less than 5 years, and the remaining 20 (83 percent)
occurred in patients aged more than 18 years. 22 patients (73
percent) required hospitalization, 16 (53 percent) required intensive
care, and 7 (23 percent) died, all from severe pneumonia. Median age
of the patients who died was 63.6 years; 5 (71 percent) were male.
One death occurred in an infant aged one month. Of the 30 Ad14 cases
with patient residence information available, 28 (93 percent)
occurred in residents of 7 Oregon counties, and 2 cases occurred in
residents of 2 Washington counties. No link was identified in
hospitals or the community to explain transmission of Ad14 from one
patient to another.

In comparison with the Ad14 patients, among the 12 adenovirus
non-type 14 patients (that is, all but 3) whose medical charts were
reviewed, 9 (75 percent) were male. Median age was 1.1 years, and 11
(92 percent) patients were aged less than 5 years. 2 (17 percent)
adenovirus non-type 14 patients required hospitalization; no ICU
admissions or deaths were reported in this group.

Washington
----------
On 16 May 2007, the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department notified
the Washington State Department of Health (WADOH) of 4 residents
housed in one unit of a residential-care facility who had been
hospitalized recently for pneumonia of unknown etiology. The patients
were aged 40-62 years; 3 of the 4 were female. One patient had
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); the 3 others had chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. All 4 were smokers.

The patients had initial symptoms of cough, fever, or shortness of
breath during 22 Apr-8 May 2007. 3 patients required intensive care
and mechanical ventilation for severe pneumonia. After 8 days of
hospitalization, the patient with AIDS died; the other patients
recovered. Respiratory specimens from all 4 patients tested positive
for adenovirus by PCR at the WADOH laboratory; isolates were
available from 3 patients, and all 3 isolates were identified as Ad14
by CDC. Ad14 had last been identified in an isolate from a patient
from Washington in May 2006, marking the 1st identification of Ad14
in the state since 2004. Active surveillance among facility residents
and staff did not identify any other cases of Ad14 illness.

Texas
-----
Since February 2007, an outbreak of cases of febrile respiratory
infection* associated with adenovirus infection has been reported
among basic military trainees at Lackland Air Force Base (LAFB).
During an initial investigation, conducted from 3 Feb to 23 Jun 2007,
out of 423 respiratory specimens collected and tested, 268 (63
percent) tested positive for adenovirus; 118 (44 percent) of the 268
were serotyped, and 106 (90 percent) of those serotyped were Ad14.
Before this outbreak, the only identification of an Ad14 isolate at
LAFB occurred in May 2006 (1).

During the period 3 Feb to 23 Jun 2007, a total of 27 patients were
hospitalized with pneumonia (median hospitalization: 3 days),
including 5 who required admission to the ICU. One ICU patient
required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for approximately 3
weeks and ultimately died. All 16 hospitalized patients from whom
throat swabs were collected, including the 5 patients admitted to the
ICU, tested positive for Ad14. Of these hospitalized patients 15
tested negative for other respiratory pathogens, and one patient had
a sputum culture that was positive for _Haemophilus influenzae_.

All health-care workers from hospital units where trainees had been
admitted were offered testing for Ad14, regardless of history of
respiratory illness. Of 218 health-care workers tested by PCR, 6 (3
percent) were positive for Ad14; 5 of the 6 reported direct contact
with hospitalized Ad14 patients.

Prevention measures implemented during the outbreak included
increasing the number of hand-sanitizing stations, widespread
sanitizing of surfaces and equipment with appropriate disinfectants,
increasing awareness of Ad14 among trainees and staff members, and
taking contact and droplet precautions for hospitalized patients with
Ad14. Beginning on 26 May [2007], trainees with febrile respiratory
illness were confined to one dormitory and both patients and staff
members were required to wear surgical masks.

Cases reported post investigation. Since the investigation, new cases
of febrile respiratory illness have continued to occur at LAFB, but
the weekly incidence has declined from a peak of 74 cases with onset
during the week of 27 May-2 Jun [2007], to 55 cases with onset during
the week of 23-29 Sep [2007] (the most recent period for which data
were available). In addition, during March-September 2007, 3 other
military bases in Texas that received trainees from LAFB reported a
total of 220 cases of Ad14 illness (Air Force Institute for
Operational Health, personal communication, 2007). However, whether
Ad14 spread from LAFB to these 3 bases has not been determined. Ad14
also was detected in April [2007] in an eye culture from an
outpatient in the surrounding community who had respiratory symptoms
and conjunctivitis. No link between this case and the LAFB cases was
identified.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Adenoviruses were 1st described in the 1950s and are associated with
a broad spectrum of clinical illness, including conjunctivitis,
febrile upper respiratory illness, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal
disease. Severe illness can occur in newborn or elderly patients or
in patients with underlying medical conditions but is generally not
life threatening in otherwise healthy adults. Adenoviruses are known
to cause outbreaks of disease, including keratoconjunctivitis, and
tracheobronchitis and other respiratory diseases among military
recruits (2,3). Although adenovirus outbreaks in military recruits
are well recognized (3), infection usually does not require
hospitalization and rarely requires admission to an ICU. Beyond the
neonatal period, deaths associated with community-acquired adenovirus
infection in persons who are not immunodeficient are uncommon and
usually sporadic.

A total of 51 adenovirus serotypes have been identified (4). The
cases described in this report are unusual because they suggest the
emergence of a new and virulent Ad14 variant that has spread within
the United States. Ad14 infection was described initially in 1955 (5)
and was associated with epidemic acute respiratory disease in
military recruits in Europe in 1969 (6) but has since been detected
infrequently. For example, during 2001-2002, Ad14 was associated with
approximately 8 percent of respiratory adenoviral infections in the
pediatric ward of a Taiwan hospital, with approximately 40 percent of
Ad14 cases in children aged 4-8 years manifesting as lower airway
disease (7).

The National Surveillance for Emerging Adenovirus Infections system
includes military and civilian laboratories at 15 sites. During
2004-2007, this surveillance system detected 17 isolates of Ad14 from
seven sites (8). Off the 17 isolates 10 (60 percent) were collected
from 3 military bases (8). Despite this surveillance, adenovirus
infections often go undetected, because few laboratories routinely
test for adenovirus and even fewer do serotyping. Wider circulation
of Ad14 might have occurred in recent years and might still be
occurring.

Further work is needed to understand the natural history of Ad14,
risk factors for severe Ad14 disease, and how Ad14 transmission can
be prevented effectively. Vaccines against adenovirus serotypes 4 and
7 (that is, Ad4 and Ad7) were used among military recruits during
1971-1999, before vaccines were no longer available. Adenoviral
disease among US military recruits subsequently increased (9). Ad4
and Ad7 oral vaccines have been redeveloped and are being evaluated
in clinical trials. Work is ongoing to determine whether the new Ad4
and Ad7 vaccines will protect against Ad14 infection. Management of
adenoviral infections is largely supportive. A number of antiviral
drugs, including ribavirin, vidarabine, and cidofovir, have been used
to treat adenoviral infections such as Ad14, but none have shown
definitive efficacy against adenoviruses (2).

Control of adenovirus outbreaks can be challenging because these
viruses can be shed in both respiratory secretions and feces and can
persist for weeks on environmental surfaces. Guidelines for the care
of patients with pneumonia (10) should be followed in cases of
suspected adenoviral pneumonia.

Clinicians with questions related to testing of patients for
adenovirus or Ad14 infection should contact their state health
departments, which can provide assistance. State health departments
and military facilities should contact CDC to report unusual clusters
of severe adenoviral disease or cases of Ad14 or to obtain additional
information regarding laboratory testing.

[Outbreaks of human adenovirus 14 and 21 have been reported recently.
Human adenoviruses 14 and 21 are classified as members of the virus
species _Human adenovirus B_, an adenovirus species implicated in a
variety of human diseases varying according to serotype. (The
classification of adenoviruses is complex. Lack of cross
neutralization combined with a calculated phylogenetic distance of
more than 10 percent separates 2 serotypes into different species. If
the phylogenetic distance is less than 5 percent, any additional
common grouping criteria from the above may classify separate
serotypes into the same species even if they had been isolated from
different hosts and consequently they should be seen as separate
species. The most numerous serotypes from the same host, the human
adenoviruses, can be clearly separated into 6 species along subgenus
lines supported by distance matrix analysis.)

Adenovirus 14 has been associated with sporadic lower respiratory
tract infection in the past, but a recent outbreak in Oregon (see
this report and ProMED-mail Adenovirus 14-associated pneumonia - USA
(OR) 20071010.3334) has heralded the appearance of a more virulent
strain of adenovirus 14. It is a challenge now for epidemiologists to
explain the subsequent (or perhaps almost simultaneous) appearance of
adenovirus 14-associated disease outbreaks in diverse communities
across North America in the absences of apparent linkages. - Mod.CP
