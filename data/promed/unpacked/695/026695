[1] USA Summary

The ongoing measles outbreak now has anti-vaxx competition from another vaccine-preventable disease, mumps. From 1-31 Jan 2019, mumps infections have been reported in 58 people from 18 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

This new data is good news when compared with 2018 when the CDC confirmed 2251 mumps cases. But, this CDC data may not include mumps cases reported by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency during 2019. So far, ICE facilities in Colorado and Texas have reported mumps cases.

The leading states reporting mumps cases during 2019 include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Arkansas: The Department of Health said cases of the mumps have been confirmed on the campus of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. A total of 3 cases have been confirmed and there is another suspected case of the mumps at the university over the last few weeks.

- Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, "An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing."

- Illinois: 8 cases were reported in 2 locations; 6 at Crystal Lake church and 2 at the McHenry County Correctional Facility. Health officials are working to determine if the 2 locations are related.

- Indiana: 2 confirmed cases of the mumps have been found at Indiana University in Bloomington, health officials said.

- Montana: 3 cases of mumps are confirmed in children attending Bozeman public schools, and health officials are investigating other possible cases.

- North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health has confirmed 5 cases of mumps statewide, 3 of them in Stark County and 2 in Williams County.

- Pennsylvania: Officials at a Delaware County elementary school are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps. Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill sent an email to parents regarding the health concern.

- Utah: Southern Utah health officials say they have a reported case of mumps that popped up at an elementary school in St. George earlier this month [February 2019]. However, they believe because of the long delay before symptoms show, there could be more cases.

- Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.

Internationally, Ireland has reported a mumps outbreak during 2019. According to reporting by the Irish Times, there have been 278 mumps cases in the 1st 6 weeks of 2019, compared with 43 for the same time in 2018, according to the HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre. A total of 9 outbreaks were reported in school, university, community, and private home settings, with the majority of cases occurring among teenagers and young adults.

A major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.

One mumps outbreak in Ireland forced the cancellation of a schools rugby match in south Dublin, while Trinity College, DCU, and schools in Co Louth have also been affected. During 2018, various colleges have reported mumps cases, such as Cincinnati, Emory, Harvard, James Madison University, Michigan, Northern Colorado, Northeastern University, Oklahoma University, Penn State, TCU, Texas State and Western Illinois University.

According to the previous study, another potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization'. A previous study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists on average about 27 years, after the last administered dose.

In response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when the 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate. This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.

Another reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.

The mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88% effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.

[2] Pennsylvania: Temple University on alert after students test positive for mumps
Date: Fri 1 Mar 2019

Students, faculty and staff at Temple University have been notified about cases of mumps on campus. Student Health Services says 4 Temple students have tested positive for the highly-infectious virus.

[Fri 1 Mar 2019] was the last day before spring break and some Temple students were worried. "Yeah, I'm a little concerned that means people aren't getting vaccinated," student Caroline Gugel said.

[One big concern with Spring break is that students who do not yet know they are infected can spread the virus to susceptible unvaccinated individuals when they travel outside the university. - Mod.LK]

During initial medical checks on the migrants entering the country, it would be good practice to vaccinate them with MMR. Similarly, all personnel working at the ICE facilities should be vaccinated to protect them and their families, as well as the incarcerated community within the facility and everyone outside. - Mod.LK]

["Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. Since the 2-dose vaccination program was introduced in 1989, mumps cases have ranged year to year from a couple of hundred to several thousand. However, in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases, from 229 cases in 2012 to 6366 cases in 2016. The recent increase has been mainly due to multiple mumps outbreaks reported across the country in settings where people often have close contact with one another, like college campuses."
