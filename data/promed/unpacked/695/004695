I would like to inform you that West Nile virus lineage 2 was
detected in _Culex_ mosquitoes collected at a region where a
neuroinvasive West Nile virus case was observed (Central Macedonia).

Although the up-to-now retrieved sequences were limited (140
nucleotides), it is clear that the Greek WNV strain is genetically
closer to Austrian, Hungarian and pathogenic African strains of lineage 2.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Papa for this information. It further confirms the
etiology of the encephalitis outbreak in Greek Central Macedonia as
WNV, and provides some intriguing clues as to the possible geographic
origin of the virus involved in Greece. WNV was detected in Austria
for the 1st time in wild birds in 2008 (see ProMED-mail archive no.
20090214.0640).
