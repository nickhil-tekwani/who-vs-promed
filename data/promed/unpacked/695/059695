Officials at Clemson Livestock Poultry Health (CLPH) have confirmed a 15-year-old Shetland pony mare with Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). The mare, which resided in Clarendon County, was unvaccinated and is deceased.

This is Clarendon County's 1st case of EEE in an equine this year [2020], and South Carolina's 17th.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the USA.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:

- Avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the USA. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[Another sad death because the animal was unvaccinated. Please recall immunity to EEE wanes quickly, and vaccination may need to be repeated every 3-4 months. Mosquitoes will be with us in various parts of the country until there is a hard freeze. Some areas have already had such a freeze; others have not.

Sadly, this is becoming an almost year-round disease.

EEE is a mosquito-borne disease preventable by vaccines and sprays approved for horses. - Mod.TG
