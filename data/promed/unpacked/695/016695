Research published in the British medical journal, The Lancet, has revealed
that a huge campaign in Egypt, decades ago, to eradicate schistosomiasis
[or bilharzia], was the cause of another major health problem, hepatitis C,
which is now endemic in the country [and affects up to one fifth of the
entire population].
[Schistosomiasis] was Egypt's biggest public health problem, affecting
villagers living along the Nile. Now, according to the Health Ministry, the
major problem is hepatitis C, which has spread dramatically, in a tragic
irony, as a result of the campaign against [schistosomiasis]. The spokesman
for the Egyptian Health Ministry, Taha al-Khubbi, said officials first
noticed a link between the blood-borne hepatitis C and [schistosomiasis]
about 10 years ago.
Now researchers have established the connection; dirty needles. Between the
1950s and 1980s, before other drugs became available, medication for
[schistosomiasis] was administered by injection, and the needles were
routinely re-used without proper sterilization. [The treatment, called
parenteral antischistosomal therapy (PAT), was conducted across Egypt from
the 1950s to the 1980s. It entailed giving between 12 and 16 intravenous
injections of an antimony salt, tartar emetic, to each patient over a short
period, the study said].
Dr al-Khubbi told the BBC that the dangers of diseases like hepatitis were
not known at the time. He said the Egyptian Health Ministry introduced
disposable needles about 10 years ago, but he said hepatitis was still
being transmitted by drug-users, dentists and through razors used in barber
shops.
The disease is a major burden on the Egyptian economy. According to Dr.
al-Khubbi, each patient costs between $1,000 and $2,000 to treat.

[Clearly the vector of this virus was reused syringes. This is the world's
largest (medically-caused) transmission of blood-borne pathogens known to
date and probably led to an increase in (at least) both hepatitis C and
hepatitis B in the general population. - Mod. CHC]
