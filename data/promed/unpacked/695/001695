A 1st-year-student of Kumasi Academy Senior High School (KUMACA) has died from meningitis bringing the death toll recorded under similar circumstances in the school to 3 in the last week [week of Sun 26 Nov 2017[. The death of [the student], a General Arts student who died at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) brings to 6 such occurrences this year [2017]. Luv News sources say several other students are on admission at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) Hospital and KATH.

Ohemeng Tawiah reported the death of 2 students on [Fri 1 Dec 2017] who were rushed to the hospital after they complained of "fever-like conditions" at the school's clinic.

Up to 3 students of the school died under similar circumstances in April [2017] this year, sparking off chaotic uproar as parents besieged the school in a desperate move to take their wards home.

Meanwhile, results of a postmortem conducted on the deceased did not reveal meningitis as had been widely claimed by some students, the reporter added. Ohemeng Tawiah said blood samples of the affected students have been sent to the Noguchi Memorial Institute in Accra for examination.

The incident had come at a time the school is preparing to round up activities to climax the 60th-anniversary celebrations. As a result school authorities have remained tight-lipped over the incident, the reporter said.

[The above news report says that 3 students at the Kumasi Academy in Kumasi, Ghana died of meningitis in the past several days, although post-mortem exam "did not reveal meningitis". The above news report also says that 3 additional students had died in April 2017 "under similar circumstances at the [Kumasi] school," although a prior ProMED-mail post last April 2017 reported that 4 students had died out of 30 "confirmed cases" of pneumococcal meningitis at the Kumasi Academy school in Kumasi, Ghana. (Please see prior ProMED-mail post Meningitis - Ghana: (AH) fatal, high school students, RFI 20170407.4953952) and subsequent ProMED-mail post in Nov 2017 said, "a thorough autopsy revealed that 4 students of Kumasi Academy Senior High in the Ashanti region died this year [2017] of the disease [pneumococcal meningitis]." This November 2017 report said that a total of 93 people had died of pneumococcal meningitis in Ghana "since last year [2016]" (Meningitis, pneumococcal - Ghana: fatal, RFI 20171112.5439630.)

Kumasi Academy is a public secondary boarding school located in Asokore-Mampong, a suburb of the city of Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti Region of Ghana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumasi_Academy). Maps of Ghana can be seen at http://www.ezilon.com/maps/images/africa/political-map-of-Ghana.gif and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5483340,50377. The Ashanti Region is located in south-central Ghana and is 3rd largest of 10 administrative regions, with a population of about 3.6 million residents in 2000, accounting for 19.1 percent of Ghana's total population (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashanti_Region).

The northern region of Ghana lies within the African meningitis belt where outbreaks of meningitis, usually due to _Neisseria meningitidis_, occur during the dry season, between November and May. The African meningitis belt is sub-Saharan and extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. A map can be seen at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/pdf/yellowbook-2012-map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis.pdf.

However, several studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may also cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract?ijkey=9d47813b96aa1d50880f62e9e7efbc4d32bfea9a&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract?ijkey=7d2ca30004fffc8d1410102f6ec758a72efc1f82&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha).

Some clarification would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources on the numbers of the affected Kumasi students and their exact diagnoses.
