A new strain of a parasite that can make dairy and beef cattle anaemic and to which they have no natural immunity is spreading rapidly throughout the North Island.

More than 100 farms have confirmed cases of the new type of theileria, which is spread by ticks and was 1st detected in the country last year [2012]. It is widespread in Australia.

The disease can make cattle lethargic and in extreme cases even kill them. About 700 beef and dairy cattle have died on more than 100 farms, and many more are sick.

The Ministry for Primary Industries says those numbers may be the tip of the iceberg and is urging farmers to be vigilant. Its modeling suggests that if there is a confirmed case on a farm, then farms within a 5-km radius are also affected.

MPI principal advisor of animal disease response Andre van Halderen says the ministry has been investigating anaemia in cattle since August last year [2012], when a lot more cases began emerging.

He says provisional results from samples collected around the country suggest the disease is far more widespread than initially thought. It has been confirmed in 20 local authority areas in the North Island and 2 in the South Island from only limited testing.

Mr van Halderen says the ministry is moving to get more medicine to treat the disease into the country and has issued a special import certificate for the strictly controlled drug.

A Waikato farmer says he discovered one of his cows had theileria last week. He says he recognised it because he'd been on a farm that had had an outbreak of theileria the day before, so knew the signs. He said a blood sample taken by the vet confirmed it, and the cow has since had a blood transfusion and is now being milked once a day and is coming right. He says if farmers suspect their cows may have theileria, or the signs are like milk fever, they should check their genitals, and if they're white, call the vet.

The new strain of theileria has been detected as far south as Canterbury.

[Theileriae are protozoan parasites carried by ticks. When ticks carrying theileriae feed on cattle, the parasites get into their bloodstream and enter red blood cells. In some animals, sufficient red blood cells are destroyed to cause anaemia, a reduction in the red blood cell numbers. This reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen and makes the animal ill.

There are several biotypes of theileria, and this article does not tell us which is one is involved.

There are 2 clinical syndromes:
1. An anaemia, abortion/stillbirth syndrome (usually with no observable lymphadenopathy [swollen lymph nodes], a highly significant clinical issue), as described in the original post, in adult cattle originating from a parasite- (and often also tick vector-) free region when moved to an infected region, or conversely, in adult cattle within a hitherto unaffected tick vector-infested region, apparently after movement of carrier livestock from an endemically affected region; and

2. A severe, highly non-responsive, acute anaemia syndrome in calves (usually 2-6 months of age or older) in tick vector and parasite endemic areas, particularly when seasonal calving and calf-hood coincide with the highest risk period for tick vectors (late winter through to mid summer).
