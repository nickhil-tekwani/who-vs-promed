Norway finds mild bird flu strain in wild duck
----------------------------------------------
Norwegian veterinarians said on Thursday tests on a wild duck had found a
"benign" version of the bird flu virus sweeping Asia.
Stein Ivar Ormsettroe, a director at the Norwegian Food Safety Authority,
said the virus had [sic; caused?] minor symptoms and was probably not even
deadly for the infected bird. "We don't think it can spread to humans," he
told Reuters, describing it as a "benign" strain of the virus that has
killed at least 19 people in Asia.
Veterinarians detected the virus after testing both wild birds and poultry
late in 2003. Authorities revealed the results on Thursday after completing
the analysis of the tests. "It is the first time we have proven bird flu
here in Norway, but it has not been investigated much before," Ormsettroe said.
Veterinarians will investigate the finding to determine by 20 Feb 2004
whether to launch a wider testing of birds.

[Surveillance programs for influenza viruses in migratory and domestic
avians are operational in various countries. In a recent paper, Ron
Fouchier and colleagues reported the results of their large-scale
surveillance in wild birds in Northern Europe in 1999 and 2000 (Avian Dis
2003; 47(3 Suppl): 857-60). One per cent of the samples were positive for
influenza A virus by RT-PCR; from half of these they were able to isolate
influenza A virus in embryonated chicken eggs. A wide variety of isolates
was obtained representing hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes 1 through 7, 10, 11,
13, an unidentifiable HA, and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes 1 through 8.
The Norwegian finding is thus not unusual; its significance might be
evaluated when the virus type involved is identified and its virulence
determined and made public. - Mod.AS]
