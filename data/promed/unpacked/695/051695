[Having been associated with a wildlife hospital, I know it is
important to understand that diseases can be transmitted there as well
as cured. Strict quarantine should be observed as part of the disease
control strategy. Although the epidemiologic description would not
lead one to suspect the Marsh Harrier did indeed spread the H5N1 virus
to other birds, wildlife hospitals often are volunteer organizations
and strong veterinary supervision should be in place - especially in
this case. The aim of most wildlife hospitals is to release the wild
birds that can be returned safely to the wild, but in this case they
should be sure that any released birds are free of H5N1.
