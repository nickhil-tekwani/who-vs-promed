165 people were confirmed to have become ill from hepatitis A after eating 'Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend' in 10 states: Arizona (24), California (80), Colorado (29), Hawaii (8), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (1), New Mexico (11), Nevada (6), Utah (3), and Wisconsin (2). [Note: The cases reported from Wisconsin resulted from exposure to the product in California, the cases reported from New Hampshire reported fruit exposure during travel to Nevada, and the case reported in New Jersey was a household contact of a confirmed case from Colorado.] 8 of the confirmed cases were household contacts of confirmed cases (secondary cases).

- 91 (55 percent) female ill persons
- Ages ranged from less than 1-84 years;
- 95 (58 percent) of those ill were between 40-64 years of age.
- 11 children age 18 or under were also ill. None were previously vaccinated.
- Illness onset dates ranged from 31 March 2013-12 Aug 2013
- 69 (42 percent) ill people were hospitalized, and no deaths were reported
- All ill people who reported eating this product purchased it from Costco markets; however, the product was also sold at Harris Teeter stores.
- No ill people were identified that bought the product at Harris Teeter.

Laboratory Investigation:
The major outbreak strain of hepatitis A virus, belonging to genotype 1B, was found in clinical specimens of 117 ill persons. This genotype is rarely seen in the Americas but circulates in North Africa and the Middle East.

Regulatory Investigation:
By combining information gained from FDA's traceback and traceforward investigations and the CDC's epidemiological investigation, FDA and CDC have determined that the most likely vehicle for the hepatitis A virus appears to be a common shipment of pomegranate seeds from a company in Turkey, Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading.

FDA has detained all shipments of pomegranate seeds from Goknur when they are offered for import into the USA.

These pomegranate seeds were used by Townsend Farms to make the Townsend Farms and Harris Teeter Organic Antioxidant Blends and by Scenic Fruit Company to make the Woodstock Frozen Organic Pomegranate Kernels.

This outbreak investigation has been finalized and the published report can be found in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases at http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/issue/current.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by faecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately treated water.

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare.

In developed countries with adequate sanitary conditions, prior to the availability of the hepatitis A vaccine, children often escape infection in early childhood. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups, and [because infections that occur in adolescents and adults are more often symptomatic] higher disease rates and large foodborne outbreaks may occur. - Mod.LL
