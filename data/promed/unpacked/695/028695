Scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
have Haitian cholera bacteria under their microscopes, and are
looking for molecular "fingerprints" that might tell them where the
bug came from. Dr. Eric Mintz, the CDC's chief detective for
diarrheal diseases, says he isn't sure of the answer yet. Mintz,
who's in Haiti, says the lab tests may show "a strain that has been
very commonly seen before. In that instance, we won't be much further
along in understanding the origin of the cholera strain here in
Haiti." Or, Mintz says, "it's possible we will see a strain we've
never seen before."

As of Friday [29 Oct 2010], Haitian officials had counted 4700 cases
of cholera and 330 deaths. Mintz says about 6 percent of victims have
died, but public health officials hope to reduce that fatality rate
to 1 percent or less.

The origins of the strain became a hot issue in Haiti this week after
the mayor of Mirebalais, a town in the middle of the outbreak,
suggested that Nepalese soldiers brought it from their homeland to a
nearby United Nations peacekeeping camp. There were outbreaks of
cholera in Nepal last summer, but UN officials say there's been no
evidence of cholera in the camp.

The CDC laboratory work so far has established that the Haitian
cholera strain is one that's been identified in Latin America, Asia
and Africa. Mintz says it may be impossible to determine exactly
where the Haitian strain came from. But "if a strain of cholera was
[already] here, it would have caused an explosive epidemic" before
now, Mintz says. "Likely it came from somewhere else." Mintz says it
may never be known where the Haitian strain came from.

But John Mekalanos, chairman of microbiology and molecular genetics
at Harvard Medical School, disagrees. He and other Harvard
researchers plan to get a much more fine-grained picture of the
Haitian strain, down to its genetic sequence.

Mekalanos says he has "no doubt" that detailed genetic analysis will
reveal "with some certainty" whether the Haitian strain was
introduced from somewhere else -- and most likely, where. 1st, the
Harvard scientists have to get it. But then it should take only a
couple of weeks to sequence the Haitian strain, and get closer to
solving the mystery.

[Indeed, it is likely that genetic analysis of the outbreak will be
able to delineate its origin. Meanwhile, the number of reported cases
continues to rise and may blossom into much larger numbers when the
infection reaches the earthquake-devastated areas of Port-au-Prince. - Mod.LL]

The number of deaths from a cholera outbreak in Haiti has reached
330, Gabriel Timothee, director-general of the health ministry, said.
Of the current 4714 suspected cholera cases, only 81 patients have
undergone tests, Timothee said, adding that 34 of those patients
tested positive for the illness.

26 of the confirmed cases were residents of the Artibonite Valley,
the epicentre of the outbreak.

The international community has provided 'massive' humanitarian
assistance since the outbreak was detected last week, Timothee said.

bacteriologically confirmed but stand as acute watery diarrhea where
cholera has been confirmed in others. - Mod.LL]
