The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 18 Jun 2018:
- A total of 60 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable and 8 suspected.
- 5 new suspicious cases in Iboko.
- 7 samples were negative.
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola virus disease since the beginning of the epidemic.
- No deaths reported so far [28 total deaths reported and holding steady].
- No new cases confirmed.

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May, 3137 people have been vaccinated, including 834 in Mbandaka, 779 in Bikoro, 1,434 in Iboko, 77 in Ingende and 13 in Kinshasa.

Mid-term evaluation of the Ebola response
- On Tue 19 Jun 2018, all partners involved in the Ebola response met at the Tomodja Center in Mbandaka to conduct the mid-term evaluation of the response. The coordinators of the Bikoro, Iboko and Itipo sites presented the epidemiological situation in each site. According to the latest data, the epidemic seems to be largely under control in Bikoro and Mbandaka. In Itipo, field teams continue efforts to identify suspicious cases and protect communities from any risk.
- During this evaluation meeting, 6 groups were formed and produced a document outlining the strengths, weaknesses, strategies and actions to be carried out.
- This mid-term evaluation work brought together all the coordination of the response composed of the provincial coordinator and representative of the National Minister of Health, Dr. Bokenge, the provincial Minister of Health Dr. Levis Bolekela, the various commissions at the provincial level as well as national and international partners.

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) announced 11 new suspected cases of Ebola over the weekend in Bikoro and Iboko, the remote health zones where the current outbreak began in the middle of May [2018], but the outbreak total has not risen.

The case count now stands at 64 cases (38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 12 suspected). The total is actually 2 cases lower than the DRC's previous count of 66 because officials have ruled out several cases previously listed as suspected. The death toll remains at 28, with no new deaths from the hemorrhagic virus reported in more than 1 week. As reported last week, the DRC confirmed that 24 people have recovered fully from their Ebola infections. The ministry of health also said that 11 previously suspected cases tested negative for the virus.

Since [21 May 2018], a total of 3017 people have been vaccinated using Merck's unlicensed VSV-EBOV vaccine, including 829 in Mbandaka, 726 in Bikoro, 1,374 in Iboko, 77 in Ingende and 11 in Kinshasa.

Experts call response 'swift'
-----------------------------
In related news, 2 experts with the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, writing in The Lancet [see report below], weighed in on the outbreak response, applauding the DRC for acting quickly and for using VSV-EBOV in a ring program that targets contacts.

"The response to the current outbreak in DRC has been rapid at the national, continental, and international levels. The DRC Health Minister, Oly Ilunga Kalenga, has led his country's response with pragmatism and expediency, both in Kinshasa and at the provincial levels, by developing a comprehensive response plan and establishing appropriate technical committees and mobilising the requisite political, financial, and technical support," the authors write.

Despite these efforts, the outbreak could be expected to last for several more weeks, the scientists said, because of the remoteness of Bikoro and Iboko. Material support is still needed as officials on the ground try to move medical materials within the far reaches of the DRC.

"There have been huge logistical challenges with airlifting supplies and health-care workers from Kinshasa to Mbandaka, Iboko, and Bikoro, because no commercial flights exist from Kinshasa to Mbandaka and motorable roads from Mbandaka to the other affected areas are non-existent," the authors write.

1. Situation update
-------------------
The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with cautious optimism. On 17 Jun 2018, 1 new suspected EVD case was reported in Itipo health area, Iboko Health Zone. Three laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. Test results of 9 suspected cases reported (previously) in Bikoro (4), Iboko (3) and Ingende (2) health zones are pending. Since [17 May 2018], no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case-patient in Iboko Health Zone developed symptoms on [2 Jun 2018], was confirmed on [6 Jun 2018] and died on [9 Jun 2018].

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 Apr 2018), a total of 62 EVD cases and 28 deaths have been reported, as of [17 Jun 2018]. Of the 62 cases, 38 have been laboratory confirmed, 14 are probable (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing) and 10 are suspected. Of the 52 confirmed and probable cases, 28 have died, giving a case fatality rate of 54 percent. Fifty-two percent (27) of the confirmed and probable cases are from Iboko, followed by 21 (40 percent) from Bikoro and four (8 percent) from Wangata health zones. A total of 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The number of contacts requiring follow-up is progressively decreasing, with a total 1417 completing the mandatory 21-day follow-up period. As of [17 Jun 2018], a total of 289 contacts were under follow up, of which 276 (96 percent) were reached on the reporting date.

Context
-------
On [8 May 2018], the Ministry of Health of the DRC notified WHO of an EVD outbreak in Bikoro Health Zone, Equateur Province. The event was initially reported on [3 May 2018] by the Provincial Health Division of Equateur when a cluster of 21 cases of an undiagnosed illness, involving 17 community deaths, occurred in Ikoko-Impenge health area. A team from the Ministry of Health, supported by WHO and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), visited Ikoko-Impenge health area on [5 May 2018] and found 5 case-patients, 2 of whom were admitted in Bikoro General Hospital and 3 were in the health centre in Ikoko-Impenge. Samples were taken from each of the 5 cases and sent for analysis at the Institute National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB), Kinshasa on [6 May 2018]. Of these, 2 tested positive for Ebola virus, Zaire ebolavirus species, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on [7 May 2018], and the outbreak was officially declared on [8 May 2018]. The index case in this outbreak has not yet been identified and epidemiologic investigations are ongoing, including laboratory testing.

[The complete situation report in PDF format can be accessed at the URL above. It is very complete with maps, figures, and tables of the outbreak. In this report, the WHO states that it "considers the public health risk to be very high at the national level due to the serious nature of the disease, insufficient epidemiological information and the delay in the detection of initial cases, which makes it difficult to assess the magnitude and geographical extent of the outbreak." Although other reports are much more optimistic as to containment of the outbreak, and the last confirmed case was 2 Jun with only 289 contacts still under follow-up, caution as expressed by the WHO is advised. - Mod.LK]

[3] Laboratory facilities
- 19 Jun 2018. BSL-4 lab Gabon
[Agence France-Presse (AFP), edited]
https://www.afp.com/en/news/2265/ultra-secure-lab-gabon-equipped-ebola-studies-doc-1657zw1

At a research facility in Gabon, one isolated building stands behind an electrified fence, under round-the-clock scrutiny by video cameras. The locked-down P4 lab is built to handle the world's most dangerous viruses, including Ebola.

"Only 4 people, 3 researchers and a technician, are authorised to go inside the P4," said virologist Illich Mombo, who is in charge of the lab, one of only 2 in all of Africa that is authorised to handle deadly Ebola, Marburg and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses. The other is in Johannesburg.

The P4 was put up 800 m (half a mile) distant from older buildings of the Franceville International Centre for Medical Research (CIRMF), in large grounds on the outskirts of Franceville, the chief city in the southeastern Haut-Ogooue province. Filming the ultra-high-security lab or even taking photos is banned and the handful of people allowed inside has security badges. Backup power plants ensure an uninterruptable electricity supply. "Even the air that we breathe is filtered," Mombo explains.

When he goes into the P4 lab to work on a sample of suspect virus such as Ebola -- which has claimed 28 lives in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) during an outbreak in the past 6 weeks -- Mombo wears a head-to-foot biohazard suit. The special clothing is destroyed as soon as he has finished. Draconian measures are in force to prevent any risk of contamination, with potentially disastrous effects.

Once a suspect virus has been "inactivated" -- a technique that stops the sample from being contagious -- it is carefully taken from the P4 unit to other CIRMF laboratories in the compound, where it is analysed. Specialised teams will scrutinise it, looking to confirm its strain of Ebola and hunting for clues such as the virus's ancestry and evolution, which are vital for tracking the spread of the disease.

CIRMF director Jean-Sylvain Koumba, a colonel in the Gabonese army and a military doctor, said lab teams had been "placed on alert" to handle Ebola samples sent on by the National Institute of Biomedical Research in the DRC capital Kinshasa. The nature of the sample can be determined with rare precision, for the facility has state-of-the-art equipment matched in few other places worldwide. "On average, it takes 24 to 48 hours between the time when a sample arrives and when we get the results," Mombo said.

Founded in 1979 by Gabon's late president Omar Bongo Ondimba to study national fertility rates, the CIRMF moved on to AIDS, malaria, cancer, viral diseases and the neglected tropical maladies that affect a billion people around the world, according to the WHO. The centre is financed by the Gabonese state, whose main wealth is derived from oil exports, and gets help from France.

In all, 150 people work for the CIRMF and live on the huge premises. Its reputation draws scientists, students and apprentices from Asia, Europe and the United States, as well as Africa. "(The) CIRMF is uniquely suited to study infectious diseases of the Congolese tropical rain forest, the 2nd world's largest rain forest," 2 French scientists, Eric Leroy and Jean-Paul Gonzalez, wrote in the specialist journal Viruses in 2012. "(It) is dedicated to conduct medical research of the highest standard (...) with unrivalled infrastructure, multiple sites and multidisciplinary teams."

The facility also conducts investigations into how lethal tropical pathogens are able to leap the species barrier, said Gael Darren Maganga, who helps run the unit studying the emergence of viral diseases. "A passive watch consists of taking a sample from a dead animal after a request, while the active watch is when we go out ourselves to do fieldwork and take samples," he said.

A major centre of interest is the bat, seen as a potential "reservoir" -- a natural haven -- for the Ebola virus, said Maganga. Staff regularly go out all over Gabon to take samples of saliva, faecal matter and blood. The consumption of monkey flesh and other bush meat is common practice in central Africa. "It's still a hypothesis, but the transmission to human beings could be by direct contact, for instance by getting scratches (from a bat) in caves, or by handling apes which have been infected by bat saliva," he said.

[4] Treatment
-19 Jun 2018. As suspected Ebola cases probed, new treatment shows promise
[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) News, edited]

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

In the latest Ebola developments, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry reported 1 more suspected infection, as tests ruled out 3 earlier cases, and researchers reported results from the 1st human trial of a monoclonal antibody cocktail that has been cleared for compassionate use in the country's outbreak.

In an encouraging sign, the DRC hasn't reported a confirmed Ebola case since [2 Jun 2018], but intensive efforts are under way in affected areas to monitor contacts and identify suspected cases.

Latest suspected case in remote area
------------------------------------
In an update yesterday [18 Jun 2018], the DRC's health ministry said that as of [17 Jun 2018], one more suspected case has been identified in Iboko, one of the hot spots in the remote forested area.

Meanwhile, tests ruled out Ebola infection in 3 earlier suspected cases, dropping the overall outbreak number to 62, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 10 suspected cases. The number of deaths remained at 28, and the number of people who have recovered stayed at 24.

Trial of monoclonal antibody cocktail
-------------------------------------
In research developments, a team from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals yesterday [18 Jun 2018] reported phase 1 clinical trial findings for an intravenous cocktail of 3 human monoclonal antibodies that target the Ebola virus glycoprotein.

The trial was supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), and the group reported its findings in an early online edition of The Lancet Infectious Diseases [see Research section above. - Mod.LK].

The experimental drug is one of the treatments evaluated by a World Health Organization expert group for possible compassionate use in the DRC's outbreak and is one of 5 treatments that was recently approved for use by a DRC health ministry ethics committee.

Regeneron's antibody cocktail is one of 4 experimental treatments that is in the DRC, and though researchers are eager to study the treatments in an outbreak setting with patients' consent, the quickly declining case numbers are dimming the prospects of clinical trials in the country.

In the phase 1 clinical trial, researchers administered a single IV dose at 3 different dosage levels to 18 healthy adults, while 6 received a placebo treatment. Then they monitored the patients daily through day 4, then at regular intervals through day 141 to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and anti-drug antibodies. The treatment was generally well tolerated, with mild headache and muscle pain the most common reported side effects. The half-life of each antibody was much longer than the average time between Ebola hospitalization and death, and treatment did not prompt an immune response against the antibody cocktail. Researchers concluded that findings support continued development of the drug as a single-dose treatment for Ebola.

The Lancet Infectious Diseases. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30397-9. - Mod.LK]

Several advantages to treatment
-------------------------------
In a related commentary, Trina Racine, PhD, with the department of medical microbiology at the University of Manitoba, wrote that several features of Regeneron's drug give it advantages over other similar treatments, including single-dose administration that could minimize healthcare burden and shipment and storage at 2 to 8 deg.C (35.6 to 46.4 deg.F), suitable for the type of cold-chain conditions that developing countries can more easily meet.

Despite encouraging results of the clinical trial, the world is still a long way away from having a licensed therapy for treating Ebola, she wrote. Racine called on the global health community to ensure that any data generated from compassionate use and clinical trials is collected under stringent conditions so that effectiveness can be assessed, and that an effective product or products can be ready for use at the beginning of future outbreaks.

[The challenge of testing Ebola treatments (https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/11/testing-ebola-treatments-outbreak/) was discussed in an article on 11 Jun 2018 by Helen Branswell in Stat News. Since this outbreak has been quickly brought under control, thankfully, there are not enough new cases to conduct a proper clinical trial with patients receiving the experimental treatment and others serving as controls. One alternative approach was suggested by Dan Bausch - "Bausch said the thinking now is that given the difficulty of generating data in any one outbreak, studies should be set up to collect data over multiple epidemics. Everyone knows Ebola will be back. Then you get 15 patients on this one and 22 on the next one and 4 on the next one and 35 on the next one. So after five5 years you have basically a multicenter longitudinal trial with systematic observations and a study design that allows for analysis."

With short outbreaks and complex permissions, testing critical Ebola treatments is a challenge. - Mod.LK]

-18 Jun 2018. Suspected exposure to filoviruses among people contacting wildlife in southwestern Uganda
[The Journal of Infectious Diseases, edited]
http://www.bit.ly/2M71R2D

[ref: Evans TS, Tutaryebwa L, Gilardi KV, et al. Suspected exposure to filoviruses among people contacting wildlife in southwestern Uganda. J Infect Dis. 2018. doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiy251>]

Abstract
--------
Background
Human and filovirus host interactions remain poorly understood in areas where Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks are likely to occur. In the Bwindi region of Uganda, a hot spot of mammalian biodiversity in Africa, human livelihoods are intimately connected with wildlife, creating potential for exposure to filoviruses.

Methods
We tested samples from 331 febrile patients presenting to healthcare facilities near Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Uganda, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and Western blot, using recombinant glycoprotein antigens for Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Marburg virus. Behavioral data on contact with wildlife were collected to examine risk factors for filovirus seropositivity.

Results
All patients were negative for active filovirus infection, by PCR analysis. However, patients were seroreactive to SUDV (4.7 percent), EBOV (5.3 percent), and BDBV (8.9 percent), indicating previous exposure. Touching duikers was the most significant risk factor associated with EBOV seropositivity, while hunting primates and touching and/or eating cane rats were significant risk factors for SUDV seropositivity. [Touching duikers (_Cephalophus_ species) was the most significant risk factor associated with EBOV seropositivity. - Mod.LK].

Conclusions
People in southwestern Uganda have suspected previous exposure to filoviruses, particularly those with a history of wildlife contact. Circulation of filoviruses in wild animals and subsequent spillover into humans could be more common than previously reported.

[There are 5 known virus species in the genus Ebolavirus, each named for the region where it was originally identified: _Bundibugyo ebolavirus_, _Reston ebolavirus_, _Sudan ebolavirus_, _Taï Forest ebolavirus_, and _Zaire ebolavirus_. This is an interesting study looking at level of exposure to Ebolaviruses in individuals presenting with a fever in Uganda, as well as indirectly addressing the question of what is the natural reservoir host for the Ebolaviruses. Research has been looking into the role bats play in the maintenance, transmission, and evolution of filoviruses since 1967 when Marburg virus first emerged in humans, and many different animals have been tested for virus. By conducting a survey using PCR in febrile individuals who are commonly exposed to wild animal species in a habitat with high biodiversity, the authors determined exposure to Ebolaviruses are more common than may have been anticipated, but it remains difficult to point to a particular species as serving as a high risk for spillover without controlling for all the other practices of the individuals. - Mod.LK]
