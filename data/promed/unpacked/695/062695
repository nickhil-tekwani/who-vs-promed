Health professionals have been urged to look out for signs of the
serious but rare disease botulism, after 4 injecting drug users
presented with suspected cases.

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) and the HSE [Health
Service Executive] in the eastern region have been informed that the
cases of wound botulism are under investigation. The disease, in this
case, is caused when spores of the organism _Clostridium botulinum_
get into an open wound.

Specialist in public health medicine Dr Suzanne Cotter said: "This is
a rare condition and we are waiting for further test results to
confirm these cases.

Wound botulism is caused by a toxin that is commonly produced by soil
bacteria. The illness can result if a wound is contaminated by soil or
gravel. In recent years this type of botulism has been most commonly
reported among chronic drug users. It occurs mainly in skin abscesses
from injecting heroin.

Botulism has previously been reported in drug users, but few cases are
seen in Ireland, according to the HPSC. "The last cases of botulism
in drug users occurred in 2002 when 3 injecting drug users developed
botulism," Dr Cotter said.

[Although a variety of neurological syndromes can present as
botulism, a group of 4 cases that appear to be epidemiologically
linked (although the locations of the cases are not stated) are
almost always botulism. - Mod.LL
