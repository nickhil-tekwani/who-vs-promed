Chile confirms letter had anthrax
---------------------------------
SANTIAGO, Chile (AP): Chilean and United States (US) officials said on
Thursday that a letter sent from Switzerland to Chile was tainted with
anthrax -- apparently the first confirmed case of the deadly bacteria in
the mail outside the US.
The letter containing the anthrax spores was received last week by a
pediatrician at a children's hospital in Santiago, the Chilean Health
Ministry said. A Health Ministry statement said that testing handled by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta has "confirmed
the presence of the anthraces bacillus [sic in an envelope received in Chile".
CDC spokesperson Lisa Swenarski said that the agency had asked the health
department in Miami to test the samples from Chile and that contamination
with anthrax had been confirmed. There have been similar reports worldwide,
some that local health officials have declared was anthrax. The Chile case
was reportedly the first [mail delivery of anthrax confirmed by US
officials outside the United States since tainted letters raised a
worldwide bioterrorism alarm in the aftermath of the 11 Sept terrorist attacks.
Dr Antonio Banfi, who received the envelope at the Calvo Mackenna Hospital,
became suspicious because the letter was postmarked in Zurich but marked
for return to Florida, the government said. There were no other details.
The envelope [was said to contain a small amount of white powder as well
as papers.
The Chilean ministry spokeswoman said it has not been determined whether
the anthrax spores found in the letter are the same as those found in the
US. The ministry said that Banfi (who opened the envelope) and 12 others
nearby have not tested positive for exposure to anthrax spores, but have
been treated.
