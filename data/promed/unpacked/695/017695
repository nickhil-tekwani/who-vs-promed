[According to the OIE WAHID database, Cambodia has had 4 outbreaks in
birds in 2006, 1 outbreak in 2007, and now 1 outbreak in 2008. It is
unfortunate that this single outbreak involving 464 backyard birds of
different species has spawned a human case. The good news is that the
young man has survived and been discharged from the hospital.
