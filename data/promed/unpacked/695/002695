Buffalo deaths raise fears of RVF in wildlife
---------------------------------------------
The deaths of over 10 buffaloes in Hells Gate National Park have sparked
fears among local conservationists that Rift Valley fever (RVF) may have
spread to wild animals, especially since 2 of the animals died in a farm
where the 1st local case of the fever was reported.
Government officials said they are waiting for results of samples from the
dead animals to determine the cause of death. The officer-in-charge at the
park, Ms Lydia Kisoyan, confirmed the deaths.

[Results from the laboratory are awaited with interest.
An earlier query from Dr Joe Dudley, the sender of the posting above,
enclosed a comment from Dr Michael Woodford (founder of IUCN (World
Conservation Union) Veterinary Specialist Group; Regional contact person
for Middle East, Western, and Central Asia, OIE Wildlife disease working
group) on the absence of current information regarding RVF in wildlife.
This, and additional raised queries, have been forwarded to Prof Glyn
Davies, a world authority on RVF. We are very grateful for his response,
which constitutes the following report. - Mod.AS]

Wildlife and RVFV
-----------------
1. Field observations
I spent a great deal of time during RVFV (Rift Valley fever virus)
epizootic periods in Kenya observing the wild ruminants on properties
affected by RVFV in domestic animals and also communicating with cattle and
sheep farmers on RVF affected farms. At no time, did I nor anyone else, see
wild animals grazing RVFV infected areas with affected cattle, show any
clinical disease, which might have been due to RVFV. Abortions may have
occurred, however, but it is unlikely that these would have been detected,
due to the presence of wild carnivores that would scavenge fetal material.
Surveys were carried out in sera collected from wild ruminants and there
was evidence that cryptic RVFV infection had occurred in some species
(Davies 1975 & unpublished data). My conclusions were that infection by
RVFV did occur in these situations, but that this was subclinical, with the
reservation that abortion may have occurred in pregnant females, which was
difficult to observe or confirm.
There was a report from South Africa that springbok and blesbok were
aborting during a RVF epizootic, but this was not confirmed to be due to
RVF (Joubert, et al. 1951).
2. Experimental inoculations
Five adult female buffalo (_Syncercus caffer_) were inoculated with RVF
virus and viraemia was detected for cc 48 h in 4 of them. Two animals,
which were pregnant, aborted. Some RVF antibody was detected in wild
population samples from buffalo, but the samples were from ecological zones
where RVFV activity was unlikely to have occurred for some considerable
time: there had been no recent periods of epizootic RVFV activity before
the sampling (Davies & Karstad, 1981).
