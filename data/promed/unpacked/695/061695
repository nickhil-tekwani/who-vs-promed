Regional members of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) are
organizing a meeting of its representatives from Bolivia, Chile, and Peru
that will probably take place in the [Chilean] city of Arica during the next
week to analyze joint actions to prevent the spread of hantavirus.

The aim of the meeting is to unite the efforts of representatives of PAHO
and health authorities of the three countries to define lines of action,
principally of prevention, explained Carlos Linger, the Director of PAHO in
Bolivia in a radio broadcast.

There is regional concern about the lethal virus since in the past two days,
125 cases were registered in Argentina, 37 cases in Brazil, and 15 in Chile.
[For the official figures, see item [1] above - Mod.JW]

Linger noted the emphasis on prevention should be directed towards the
vector of the disease before an insurgence of the virus in the country as
well as other diseases that rodents transmit. He emphasized preventive
measures should include observing strict hygiene in places that habitually
shelter rodents, as well as in areas used for food storage.
