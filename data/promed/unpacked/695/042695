New York City health officials are monitoring a new cluster of legionnaires' disease cases in the Bronx. Officials announced [Mon 29 Sep 2015] that 7 cases have been diagnosed in the borough's Morris Park neighborhood. All 7 patients are hospitalized, but no fatalities have been reported.

They say the cases are not connected to a legionnaires' outbreak in the Bronx last month [August 2015] that claimed 12 lives. That outbreak, the largest in the city's history, was traced to _Legionella_ bacteria in the cooling tower of the Opera House Hotel. Officials say the 1st case of the new cluster was reported on [21 Sep 2015].

Legionnaires' disease spreads through inhaling the mist of water contaminated with legionella bacteria. It can usually be traced to warm water sources such as cooling towers, hot water tanks, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, humidifiers, and condensers in large air conditioning systems. Symptoms of legionnaires' disease typically appear between 2 days and 2 weeks after exposure to the bacteria. Patients may develop pneumonia and experience symptoms include headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion, and diarrhea. The illness can be treated with antibiotics. The disease cannot be spread from person to person.

Officials said New York City sees about 200 to 300 cases of legionnaires' disease a year. The city created new cooling tower cleaning regulations after the previous outbreak. The law requires building owners to register, inspect, and regularly clean cooling towers, and obtain an annual certification. Violators would face fines up to USD 25 000.

[The Bronx is the northernmost of the 5 boroughs of New York City, in the US state of New York. The Bronx is the 3rd most densely populated county in the US (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx). There have been 2 legionnaires' disease outbreaks in the South Bronx in the past several months; see ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis - USA (13): (New York City) new outbreak, RFI 20150904.3622929 and Legionellosis - USA (10): (New York City) outbreak over, source found, RFI 20150821.3592871. The South Bronx is about 6 miles [about 10 km] to the south west of Morris Park, the neighborhood where the current legionnaires' disease outbreak is occurring and reported in the news report above. A map of the Bronx showing the locations of the South Bronx and Morris Park can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Morris+Park,+Bronx,+NY/South+Bronx,+Bronx,+NY/. More information on the Morris Park outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

A recent study of the epidemiology of legionnaires' disease in New York City analyzed surveillance data for 2002-2011, in addition to associations between acquisition of _Legionella_ infection and socioeconomic and occupational groups (1). The study found that incidence of legionnaires' disease in the city of New York increased 230 per cent from 2002 to 2009, with highest incidence occurring in the highest poverty areas. Risk factors included working in transportation, repair, protective services, cleaning, or construction.

The abstract is reproduced below:
"Incidence of legionnaires' disease in the United States is increasing. We reviewed case records to determine the epidemiology of and risk factors for the 1449 cases reported to the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, New York, New York, USA, during 2002-2011. The highest incidence (2.74 cases/100 000 population) occurred in 2009; this incidence was higher than national incidence for that year (1.15/100 000). Overall, incidence of legionnaires' disease in the city of New York increased 230 per cent from 2002 to 2009 and followed a socioeconomic gradient, with highest incidence occurring in the highest poverty areas. Among patients with community-acquired cases, the probability of working in transportation, repair, protective services, cleaning, or construction was significantly higher for those with legionnaires' disease than for the general working population. Further studies are required to clarify whether neighborhood-level poverty and work in some occupations represent risk factors for this disease." - Mod.ML
