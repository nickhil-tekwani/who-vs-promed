The Palapye [Central District] Administration Authority has registered 47 cases of malaria this year [2014], as was revealed by Palapye Primary Hospital spokesperson, Ms Mpho Modibedi in an interview recently. She stated that of the 47 cases of malaria recorded in the region, Palapye recorded the highest number, 19.

"Other affected villages include Seolwane, Malaka, Makoro, ... Lechana, Lerala, Lecheng, and Matolwane. So far, 2 people have died from malaria," said Ms Modibedi.

She attributed the malaria outbreak to heavy rains in the first quarter, which resulted in pools of stagnant water that provided breeding areas for mosquitoes. She added that the high mobility of people in and around Palapye, who frequently travelled to malaria endemic areas, also contributed to the outbreak in the sub-district.

To combat the problem, Ms Modibedi said the Palapye District Health Management Team conducted community sensitisation through health education on malaria.
