Hantavirus Death Confirmed in Northeastern Arizona
----------------------------------------------
The Arizona Department of Health Services today urged the public to
take appropriate precautions when living or working in rodent infested
areas, following confirmation of a fatal case of Hantavirus Pulmonary
Syndrome (HPS) in northern Arizona.
A case of the disease was confirmed on Tuesday in a teenage Navajo
County resident. The diagnosis was confirmed through testing at the
Arizona State Health Laboratory.
"Health officials in the area are conducting an investigation to
identify the circumstances and the potential source of disease
exposure," said Craig Levy, manager of the ADHS Vector-Borne and
Zoonotic Disease Section.
This is the first confirmed case of HPS in Arizona this year. To date,
33 cases of HPS have been reported in Arizona since 1992. Nine cases
were fatal. Four cases were reported in Arizona last year.
Nationwide, there have been more than 280 cases of HPS reported in 31
states since the virus was first recognized. Of these, 38 percent were
fatal. The disease was first recognized during a 1993 outbreak that
occurred in the Four Corners area, affecting 53 people in Arizona,
Utah, New Mexico and Colorado.
For more information about HPS, contact the ADHS Vector-Borne &
Zoonotic Disease Section at (602) 230-5932.
