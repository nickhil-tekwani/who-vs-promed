Lobster farmers in Ly Son Island off central Quang Ngai province are suffering from severe losses due to the deaths of lobsters in recent days.

Within the last week [28 Sep - 4 Oct 2015], 15 per cent of lobsters raised in the district have been reported dead, Le Van Doi, Deputy Head of Economic and Rural Infrastructure Department has said. Doi said the dead ones weigh between 300-500 grams.

Vo Van Thanh, a local farmer in An Vinh commune said that although he has been checking and conducting sanitary treatment for the cages, he could not find the reason for the deaths.

Thanh also said the price of lobster ranges from VND 320 000 to 350 000 (USD 14.2-15.6) per kilo, hence, 4 to 5 lobsters dying per day is costing farmers more than VND one million (USD 44.5).

In the market, the price of commercial lobsters continues to drop to as low as half compared to last year [2014]. For most farmers, their entire capital and loans are poured into raising lobsters, so bankruptcy is quite possible, Thanh said.

Deputy Head of the Veterinary Station of the district Truong Dinh Nho said the station has cooperated with related agencies to investigate the cause.

Deputy Head of the Veterinary Station of the district Truong Dinh Nho said the station has cooperated with related agencies to investigate the cause.

According to the investigation, some farming households bought lobster breeds of an unknown origin and failed to comply with farming procedures, thereby affecting the growth of lobsters.

Moreover, when the lobsters got sick, farmers were unable to promptly detect early signs of disease resulting in mass deaths.

On the other hand, it could also be caused by hot weather, oxygen deficiency at the bottom of the water body or from contamination caused by leftover food, Nho said.

The Economic and Rural Infrastructure Department is co-ordinating with local agencies to encourage farmers to harvest sellable lobsters, move the cages and lobsters to other farming areas not affected by pollution.
