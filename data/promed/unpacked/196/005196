Efforts to track down the stable mates of a Dutch cow with bovine spongiform
encephalophy (BSE) have again ['again' ! MHJ revealed major gaps in the
country's livestock registration system. Twelve of the stable mates of Trix
9, the fourth and latest case of BSE uncovered in the Netherlands, are
missing from the national livestock register, Junior Farm Minister Geke
Faber said in a letter to parliament on Tuesday.
It is the second time the register has failed in its objective of tracking
livestock movements around the country. Inspectors tracing the descendants
of a previous BSE case discovered in the northern Dutch province of
Groningen in August came across similar gaps in the system.
A farm ministry spokeswoman said on Tuesday the ministry was working on
improvements to the register, which it estimated currently fails to account
for around half a million cattle. The "floating cattle" problem stemmed from
the fact that farmers and exporters did not always report to whom they had
sold their livestock, the spokeswoman said.
Minister Faber has pledged to improve the registration system given its key
role in tracking down and preventing disease and in reassuring other
countries and consumers. In her letter to parliament on Tuesday, Faber said
Trix 9's 12 missing stable mates had all probably been slaughtered
for consumption. However 83 other cattle linked to Trix 9 had all
tested negative for BSE, she said.
[Not being given to schaudenfreude I cannot but help noting that this is a
country where goverment and animal protection organisations are obsessed
with identification and traceability of animals. As other countries take up
the EU mantra of total animal registration, we can confidently expect to see
more similar incidents. This will be paralleled by an increasing dependence
on computer files and technology, and a reduction in old fashioned,
competent shoe-leather tracing - Mod. MHJ
