Over 40 000 birds culled in Pakistan following bird flu outbreak at 13 farms
-----------------------------------------------
Authorities in Pakistan have culled over 40 000 birds following
outbreaks of deadly H5N1 avian influenza strains at about 13 poultry
farms on the outskirts of the capital city.
Official sources told KUNA on Sunday [23 Apr 2006] that blood samples
tested at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) have confirmed the
presence of bird flu at about 13 poultry farms in Tarlai and Alipur
Farash areas, only 10 km from here. This brings the total number of
affected farms in Tarlai and Alipur Farash to 13.
Sources said following confirmation that, so far, over 40 000 birds
have been culled, and the culling is still continuing.
They said 5 more farms with suspected H5N1 strains have been
quarantined and that samples have been sent to the NRL for
confirmation. Another source confirmed outbreaks at these 5 farms.
The Health Ministry and Livestock commissioner confirmed H5N1 strains
at only 6 farms and mild strains of H5 at 12 poultry farms in the 2 areas.
Pakistan reported its 1st outbreak of H5N1 at 2 farms in North-West
Frontier Province (NWFP) in February 2006, leading to the culling of
30 000 chicks and chickens.
There were also reports of human cases, but an official statement,
issued Sunday [23 Apr 2006], said that 49 samples collected from
persons with suspicion of human avian flu have tested negative as of Saturday.

[Our posting Avian influenza - worldwide (95): DEU, NOR, FRA, UK,
included the following commentary: "Norway has become, to the best of
our knowledge, the 1st European country which allowed (albeit,
extremely restricted) vaccination of avians in spite the fact that no
H5N1 infection, in wild or domestic birds, has been recorded within
its boundaries." Jan Braakman rightly reminds us that "the Dutch are
already vaccinating poultry animals, on a voluntary basis, although
no H5N1 has been detected within our boundaries." We are grateful for
the correction and, in view of the significance of the subject, use
this opportunity to add, for the benefit of readers of ProMED-mail,
the following 2 items with information on the Dutch avian influenza
vaccination policy. - Mod.AS]

Vaccination of poultry starts 16 Mar 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Keepers of hobby poultry and free-range chickens may have their birds
vaccinated against avian influenza from Thu 16 Mar 2006 until 30 Jun
2006. Hobby poultry keepers wishing to vaccinate their birds should
contact their veterinarian. On the 1st visit to the veterinarian, a
blood sample will be taken, and the bird will be vaccinated and
registered. On the 2nd visit, 3 to 4 weeks later, a 2nd vaccination
will be given. On the 3rd visit, the veterinarian will once again
take a blood sample for testing. Three weeks after the 2nd
vaccination, the birds may again go outdoors.
Vaccination is voluntary and provides protection for a maximum of one
year. The costs of vaccination are to be borne by the poultry keeper.
The costs for the blood tests will be borne by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality. Vaccination will take place at
the location where the birds are housed.
All birds must be older than 7 weeks, as they are then fully grown.
Commercial poultry farmers may only have their free-range laying hens
vaccinated. Hobby poultry keepers may only vaccinate chickens,
turkeys, ducks and geese. All hobby birds to be vaccinated are fitted
with a leg ring bearing the text "Vaccinatie AI 2006 NL."
Vaccination is an alternative to keeping the birds indoors or under
cover and is one of the ways of controlling the risk of infection and
spread of avian influenza. Poultry farmers who do not wish to have
their flock vaccinated must continue to keep their birds indoors or
under cover until the ban is lifted.
Vaccination does not guarantee that birds will not be culled if an
outbreak occurs. But culling will only take place if absolutely
necessary, in order to prevent further spread of the disease.
The European Union approved the Dutch vaccination plan on 22 Feb
2006. The Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality has drawn
up a plan for the vaccination and ensured that vaccine is approved
and available: 4 million doses of Gallimune Flu H5N9 from supplier Merial.
The European Commission places several conditions on vaccination. No
vaccinated poultry may be taken across the border and must be
slaughtered in the Netherlands. Meat from vaccinated birds may be exported.

A letter from the Dutch Minister of Agriculture to the Chairman of
the 2nd Chamber of Parliament: Preventive vaccination bird flu, 16 Mar 2006
-----------------------------------------------
Dear Mr. President,
In my letter of 23 Feb 2006 (Parliamentary proceedings 2005-2006, 28
807 no. 100), I informed you of the agreement reached in Brussels on
the preventive vaccination of hobby poultry and free-range laying
hens as protection against the highly pathogenic avian influenza
H5N1. This is laid down in Commission Decision 2000/14/EC of 24 Feb
2006, in which the Netherlands is given permission, under strict
conditions, to vaccinate all hobby poultry, organic hens and
free-range laying hens as a preventive measure. Vaccination is to be
carried out in accordance with the approved vaccination plan
submitted by the Netherlands. The vaccination plan is enclosed. [See
Action Plan: preventive, voluntary vaccination of poultry in the
Netherlands in response to the current threat of Avian Influenza
(H5N1), (13 pages), available at
<http://www9.minlnv.nl/pls/portal30/docs/FOLDER/MINLNV/LNV_INTERNATIONAL/ENGELS_KAMERCORRESPONDENTIE/2006_ENGELS/20060316_VD_2006_862_ENG_BIJLAGE.PDF>.
- Mod. AS].
The organizations involved have worked hard over recent weeks to
prepare for the implementation of the vaccination plan. This has
resulted in the publication of "Tijdelijke vrijstellingsregeling
vaccinatie hobbypluimvee, biologische legkippen en legkippen met
vrije-uitloop" in the Official Gazette of 15 Mar 2006. This exemption
scheme implements the Commission's Decision and makes voluntary
vaccination possible from 16 Mar 2006.
The scheme is an important step towards ending the EU's
non-vaccination policy for a number of major animal diseases. I
myself welcome the fact that the Netherlands can now start preventive
vaccination against the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Vaccination is
an alternative to the requirement that these birds be kept indoors.
In the event of an outbreak, culling may include vaccinated birds but
culling will only be carried out if this is absolutely necessary from
a veterinary point of view.
The vaccination plan applies to the period from March to June 2006
for hobby poultry and from March 2006 to June 2007 for organic layers
and free-range hens (this in connection with vaccination during rearing).
In addition to the fact that the approval for preventive vaccination
still only applies to a limited number of species, it also applies
for a limited period.
The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) supervises the
vaccination plan. The plan provides for the manner and the conditions
under which vaccination is to take place. The plan includes
registration, monitoring and the transport of vaccinated and
non-vaccinated birds. The General Inspection Service (AID) enforces
the vaccination plan. The Animal Health Service is in charge of
distributing the vaccines and leg rings. The costs of vaccination are
to be borne by the poultry keeper.
It is important to carry out intensive monitoring in the flocks where
preventive vaccination is carried out, as it is very difficult to
detect infection with the AI virus in vaccinated birds. The European
Commission considers the Dutch vaccination plan as a pilot, as little
practical experience has so far been gained with preventive
vaccination of poultry against H5N1. This is why the Netherlands is
to submit an evaluation on the implementation and effectiveness of
the vaccination by the end of June 2006. Sufficient monitoring data
should therefore be available. The monitoring costs are borne by the
government to keep participation thresholds as low as possible.
For commercial poultry producers, the monitoring practically
coincides with the required 3-monthly AI monitoring of their flocks.
Only the introduction of sentinel birds in their flocks is an
additional measure, which will be funded by the government.
The trade of vaccinated and non-vaccinated birds and products must be
strictly separated to prevent any negative impact on the trade in
non-vaccinated animals. Consignments of non-vaccinated poultry,
day-old chicks and hatching eggs must be accompanied by a health
certificate stating that the poultry, day-old chicks and hatching
eggs originate from a holding where no vaccination has been carried
out. This is why in the Netherlands holdings with vaccinated birds
and holdings with non-vaccinated birds must be strictly separated. A
stringent trading regime applies to all vaccinated poultry and the
products derived from them. The normal trading regime applies to
holdings with non-vaccinated flocks.
No poultry, day-old chicks and hatching eggs originating from
holdings where vaccinated birds are kept may be moved without
authorization. The main condition of this authorization is that the
animals or products are moved to a slaughterhouse in the Netherlands
or to another vaccinated holding in the Netherlands. Reception of
such animals or products affects the status of the holding where the
vaccinated animals or products are received.
Eggs, other than hatching eggs, and poultry meat from vaccinated
holdings may be traded freely in the Netherlands. Their transport to
other Member States is subject to certain conditions. Manure from
vaccinated holdings may not be moved abroad.
The transport of vaccinated hobby poultry and their products are also
subject to conditions. In principle, no vaccinated hobby poultry,
day-old chicks and hatching eggs may be moved. Transport may only
take place under certain conditions, one of these being that they be
moved to another vaccinated holding in the Netherlands. This prevents
vaccinated birds or products from being mixed with commercial birds
or birds in other Member States.
The possibility of preventive vaccination will be advertised in the
media and over the internet. Flyers will be distributed to the
parties concerned.
Yours sincerely,
Minister of Agriculture, Nature
and Food Quality,
Cees Veerman

[The above website includes also the following additional explanatory
notes for the general public (as well as instructions to
veterinarians that not reproduced here but can be accessed by those
interested).
"1. Protection vaccine
The vaccine will protect the birds for a maximum period of 12 months.
Vaccinated birds are less susceptible to infection. In most cases,
they will not catch the disease themselves. Infected vaccinated birds
excrete far less of the virus, which substantially reduces the risk
of other animals getting infected. Not enough is known about the
effect of vaccination in animals other than chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys.
2. Vaccination is voluntary
Keepers of hobby poultry and free-range chickens can decide for
themselves whether to vaccinate their flocks or keep them under
cover. Two or 3 weeks after the 2nd vaccination (this depends on
vaccine specifications), vaccinated birds are allowed outside again.
In the event of an outbreak, culling may include vaccinated flocks.
This will depend on the scale of the outbreak. Culling will only be
carried out if this is absolutely necessary from a veterinary point of view.
3. Veterinarian
Keepers of hobby poultry and free-range chickens who want to have
their birds vaccinated should ring their veterinarian. The
veterinarian vaccinates on site. Vaccination requires 3 visits. The
1st time the veterinarian comes around for vaccination,
identification and registration of the birds. The 2nd visit is for
the 2nd vaccination. During the 3rd visit, the veterinarian will take
blood samples. The costs for the keeper depend on the size of the
flock and the veterinarian's fees, but will come down to an average
100 to 200 euros [USD 123.41 to 246.82] per keeper. Each vaccinated
bird will be identified and registered.
4. Export
The vaccination of hobby poultry and free-range chickens should not
have any effect on trade. There are no legal reasons for it. Response
from 3rd World countries is difficult to predict, but there,
vaccination is less of a problem than in Europe. Hobby poultry must
not be moved to other Member States unless authorization is granted.
Although there is no danger in eating the meat of hobby birds, they
may not be put on the market for consumption. Vaccinated live poultry
may not be moved abroad and must be slaughtered in the Netherlands.
There is no ban on the export of eggs and meat of vaccinated animals.
5. Safety meat
There is no danger in eating the meat of vaccinated animals. Much of
it is already in the shops, like Argentinean beef. All commercial
poultry is vaccinated against Newcastle Disease as a matter of
course, and in parts Italy, poultry is vaccinated against the low
pathogen strain of the bird flu virus, and this meat is also for sale
in our shops."
In addition to the data available on the official website, Jan
Braakman kindly provided the following information: On 6 Apr 2006,
the Dutch newspaper Agrarisch Dagblad reported that during about 3
weeks since the start of the vaccination scheme, 1530 hobby-bird
holdings and 2 commercial farms registered for vaccination, and 1007
vets in 321 practices sent their registration forms to carry out vaccinations.
France and Israel have also implemented a selective preventive
avian-influenza vaccination policy in line with European COUNCIL
DIRECTIVE 2005/94/EC of 20 Dec 2005 on Community measures for the
control of avian influenza. These countries, however, have
experienced (respectively, one and 9) outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in
commercial flocks.
The French protocol of the vaccination scheme is available (in
French) at
