We were very interested to read moderator MHJ's comments (reference
980626004905 cited above) on the existence of a human _Salmonella
enteritidis_ (SE) reservoir in Southern California. However, public health
officials in California are not aware of evidence that would allow one to
conclude that such a human reservoir exists. Southern California has been
experiencing an ongoing epidemic of SE in humans starting in 1993. SE has
become the most common serotype of Salmonella reported (28.4% of all
salmonellae in CA in 1997) supplanting _S. typhimurium_, while the total
number of cases of salmonellosis has risen only slightly. Phage typing of
both sporadic and outbreak-associated SE isolates from Southern California
has continued to show that illnesses are predominantly caused by Phage Type
4 (PT4).
Consumption of raw or undercooked eggs and eating in a restaurant in the
three days prior to illness were identified as independent, significant
risk factors for the diagnosis of sporadic SE in a published case-control
study conducted in 1994 in Los Angeles County (Passaro DJ, et al, Epidemic
_Salmonella enteritidis_ infection in Los Angeles County, California. The
predominance of phage type 4. West J Med. 1996 Sep;165(3):126-130.). These
findings for sporadic SE were duplicated in a study conducted by another
Southern California county the following year (unpublished data).
>From 1993-1997, 28 outbreaks of SE have been reported in California where
a specific food vehicle was identified. In 23 of these outbreaks, raw or
undercooked egg products were implicated as the vehicle. In none of these
outbreaks was person-to-person spread documented or suggested as the source
of the outbreak. In one investigation, the outbreak seems to have been
propagated by person-to-person spread associated with sick food handlers
after the initial egg exposure. Since 1996, 6 egg-associated outbreaks had
tracebacks conducted to identify the source of the implicated eggs. In 3 of
these 6 tracebacks, SE was identified in environmental samples taken on the
egg ranch. The overwhelming evidence indicates that the SE problem in
Southern California is due to the consumption of undercooked or raw eggs
and egg dishes, very similar to the situation described in the past for SE
in the Northeast United States and in Europe.
The conclusion of a human reservoir for SE may have been extrapolated from
a report of an investigation of the first chicken ranch where SE PT4 was
isolated in Southern California in 1994 (not associated with any known
human illnesses) (Kinde H, et al. Sewage effluent: likely source of
Salmonella enteritidis, phage type 4 infection in a commercial chicken
layer flock in Southern California. Avian Dis. 1996 Jul;40(3):672-76). SE
PT4 and several other _Salmonella_ serotypes were cultured using Moore swab
methods from a stream adjacent to the ranch where the water flow consisted
of effluent from a municipal sewage treatment up-stream. The effluent had
undergone only secondary treatment prior to being discharged into the
stream bed. This finding is not surprising since the SE epidemic had been
under way for some time, and we would expect that municipal waste might
have SE PT4 and other Salmonella present. This finding is not evidence for
a human SE PT4 reservoir in Southern California. The findings of SE on the
other egg ranches described above had no connection with sewage
contamination. The ultimate source of SE on this first ranch remains
unknown. It could be described as something of a "What came first, the
sewage or the egg?" dilemma.
This data has prompted an ongoing and aggressive public education program
addressing safe food handling and risk reduction that is carried out by the
local and State public health agencies. The egg industry in California has
adopted an egg quality assurance program to reduce the risk of SE
contamination in eggs.
In conclusion, there is ample data to suggest that human SE in Southern
California is associated with the consumption of raw or undercooked egg
dishes, and is not associated with widespread food contamination by sewage,
human-to-human transmission, or some covert human reservoir. The challenge
we still face is to identify the reasons why SE [presumably PT4 ... MHJ is
primarily a Southern California problem. The precipitous rise in SE cases
and rates has been seen almost exclusively in the five large, urban
Southern California counties. Theories to explain this distribution of
cases and outbreaks might include a differential distribution of more
highly contaminated eggs to Southern California, or some other unknown
ecological factor. Unfortunately, we have not been able to obtain detailed
egg distribution data in California in order to examine these hypotheses.

[My comment was as a result of information provided me by a colleague whom
I have found to be normally very well informed in these matters. I greatly
appreciate Mssrs Reilly & Co's full exposition of the current situation in
California. Most illuminating. Even we in Louisiana have heard of the
success of their HACCP-type programme. - Mod.MHJ
