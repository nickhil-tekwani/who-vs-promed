The Ebonyi commissioner for health, Sunday Nwangele, said on Tue 20 May 2014 that 6 medical staff of the Federal Teaching Hospital, FETHA, Abakaliki, had tested positive for Lassa fever.

Mr Nwangele confirmed to journalists in Abakaliki that the 6 were among the 11 doctors and 5 nurses who were rushed to the virology laboratory in Irrua, Edo for testing. The state chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association, NMA, last Thursday [15 May 2014] announced that 11 doctors and 5 nurses had contracted the disease after participating in a clinical operation on a pregnant woman in the hospital.

The state NMA chairman, Chidi Esike, told journalists at a news conference in Abakaliki that the woman and her baby died a few days after they were discharged from the hospital.

Mr Esike also said that the state had recorded 25 deaths due to Lassa fever since 2005, adding that many of them were medical personnel.

Commenting on the development, the commissioner said: "No life was lost except for the pregnant woman and her baby through whom the health workers contracted the disease. The 16 patients were rushed to Irrua when they were discovered to be resistant to malaria fever treatment, and 6 of them have been confirmed positive through a laboratory test. They are now undergoing intensive care treatment, and they are all stable. But I want to say that not every case of resistance to malaria fever treatment is a Lassa fever case, he said.

Mr Nwangele said that the joint committee set up by the state Ministry of Health and FETHA on Lassa fever had evolved a 2-way approach for treatment of the disease. According to him, the method involves short and long-term control measures. "On the short-term approach, the suspected patient is administered with prophylaxis tablets, while on the long-term control, the patient that is clinically down receives injectable drugs. The state government is partnering with FETHA on the short-term control method, while government has in this regard donated tablets and personal protection equipment to affected patients. The state would not accept being an endemic state and has mapped out land for the construction of a virology laboratory in Abakaliki," he said.

Mr Nwangele noted that most of the Lassa fever cases in the area were imported, and manifested in the form of "operateable cases." He said that the pregnant woman through whom the health workers contracted the disease was not from the state. "We were contacted by the dermatology team to determine her close contacts and how she got the disease. I want to advise the public to always keep their environment clean, avoid exposing edibles to rats, and if possible exterminate all rats around them," he advised.

[Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of Nigeria. Several of the above cases are reported as imported from other regions of Nigeria. As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived report 20130131.1524034: "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multi-system disease. Exceptionally, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine and treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients."

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures.
