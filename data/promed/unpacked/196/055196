As of 30 Oct 2005, the Ministry of Health, Guinea has reported a
total of 9 cases of acute jaundice syndrome suspected to be yellow
fever. Preliminary confirmation of 6 cases was carried out by the
National Reference Laboratory of Donka hospital. Samples from the 9
cases have been sent for final confirmation to the WHO Collaborating
Centre for Yellow Fever, the Pasteur Institute at Dakar, Senegal.

The cases occurred between 3-23 Oct 2005 in the regions of Boke (3
cases), Kankan (2 cases), N'Zerekore (one case), Faranah (one case)
and Conakry city (2 cases).

WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health in risk assessment and
implementation of control measures. With the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO) support, the WHO Regional Office for
Africa will be sending a team composed of an epidemiologist,
entomologist and virologist.
