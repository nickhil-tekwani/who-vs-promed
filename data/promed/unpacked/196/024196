From 1 Jan to 12 May 2013 (epidemiologic week 19), 9249 suspected cases of meningitis, including 857 deaths, with a case fatality ratio of 9.3 percent, have been reported from 18 of the 19 African countries under enhanced surveillance [Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan and Togo] for meningitis. The number of cases reported so far are the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years.

Outbreaks of meningococcal disease have been confirmed in Guinea and South Sudan, where 404 suspected cases (38 deaths) and 196 suspected cases (13 deaths) have respectively been notified.

In Guinea, a small outbreak at the sub-district level was reported in Siguiri district, predominantly due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 (Nm W135). Upon request from the Ministry of Health of Guinea, the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control released 63 075 doses of ACW polysaccharide vaccines. A reactive vaccination campaign targeting the affected population was conducted by the Ministry of Health from 2-7 May 2013.

In South Sudan, an outbreak of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (Nm A) was confirmed in Malakal County in the Upper Nile state. The ICG released 198 770 doses of meningococcal A conjugate vaccine to implement a reactive vaccination campaign from 15-24 May 2013, which was led by the Ministry of Health of South Sudan with the support of WHO and partners.

Additionally, outbreaks of meningitis were reported in Benin (one district), Burkina Faso (one district), and Nigeria (3 districts). These outbreaks were of short duration, and the predominance of the Nm bacteria was not confirmed. The ministries of health of affected areas implemented a series of preventive and control measures, which include reinforcement of surveillance, case management, and sensitization of the population.

The decrease in the number of cases of meningitis reported during the period under review is thought to be due to the progressive introduction of the newly developed meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt since 2010. The introduction of this 1st meningococcal vaccine available for preventive purposes in Africa has enabled the immunization of over 100 million people from 10 countries [1] in the meningitis belt in the past 3 years (2010-2012). The reduced case load and epidemic activity observed this year [2013] adds to the evidence on the impact of the introduction of this vaccine, which is expected to eliminate epidemics of Nm A, which is the predominant cause of the disease in Africa. Given that large-scale epidemics in the African meningitis belt appear to occur in waves of 4 to 10 years, close surveillance for meningitis remains essential.

Meningitis outbreaks are detected as part of the enhanced meningitis surveillance system introduced in 2002, whereby participating countries collect and send weekly, district level data to the WHO African Regional Office Inter-Country support team of Ouagadougou, which compiles and disseminates this data through a weekly regional bulletin. This allows for timely detection of outbreaks at the district level as well as monitoring of the situation at a regional level, enabling the identification of cross border, multi-country epidemics and a coordinated response.

WHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation closely, in collaboration with partners and ministries of health in the affected countries.

[Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the sub-Saharan African region known as the "meningitis belt" each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif.

At least 13 serogroups of _Neisseria meningitidis_, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, and W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Although serogroup C accounts for most US outbreaks (Woods CW, Rosenstein NE, Perkins BA: _Neisseria meningitidis_ outbreaks in the United States 1994-1997 (Abstract). In: Proceedings of Annual Meeting of IDSA. 12-15 Nov 1998. Denver, Colorado. Alexandria (VA): Infectious Disease Society of America; 1998), serogroup A is most commonly associated with meningitis in the African meningitis belt. However, outbreaks have also been caused by serogroups C (http://www.cdc.gov/meningitis/lab-manual/chpt02-epi.html), W135 (http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14760584.5.3.319), and X (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X13004751), and in March 2012, a serogroup B outbreak occurred in Ethiopia (http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/3581-ethiopia-suspected-meningitis-outbreak-situation-as-of-08-march-2012-.html).

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/).

Capsular polysaccharide or protein conjugate vaccines are available to immunize against disease caused by serogroups A, C, W-135, and Y. However, no similar vaccine is available against disease caused by serogroup B or X strains. A new protein-based, 4-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine has been developed that is hoped will be a broad-spectrum B vaccine (Cohn AC, Messonnier ME. Inching Toward a Serogroup B Meningococcal Vaccine for Infants. JAMA 2012;307(6):614-615.; and Stephens DS. Comment. Prevention of serogroup B meningococcal disease. Lancet 2012;379(9816):592-594).

The meningococcal protein conjugate polysaccharide vaccines induce a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in infants, provide long-lasting immunity, and prevent nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_, thus reducing transmission of this microorganism person-to-person (see http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf). A preventive strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and more enduring impact on attempts to control the yearly recurrences of this disease in Africa that causes considerable morbidity and mortality, especially among children (see http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/19745499/102).

Because meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains, laboratory confirmation of the serogroup causing an outbreak is important so that the appropriate vaccine is used. - Mod.ML
