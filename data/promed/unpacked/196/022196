[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours there has been 1 newly confirmed case in China, an imported case. No new deaths were reported. Also, 6 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, with no new cases reported in Macau. A total of 1762 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours: 2 locally acquired, 2 imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The last report of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic was yesterday (1 Jun 2020) when 2 conversions were reported. Prior to that a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions are, what is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of symptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 233 515 cases, including 33 530 deaths, up by 318 cases and 55 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (1 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 178 cases and 60 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also in decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country (see table at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4844_1_file.pdf), in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined today (2 Jun 2020) account for 85.2% of reported newly confirmed cases (an increase from 51.7% reported yesterday 1 Jun 2020) in the past 24 hours. Lombardy returned to its position of reporting the most newly confirmed cases in the 24 hour period (187), and the only province reporting more than 100 new cases. 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases), another 3 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, and 1 province (Piedmont) reported more than 50 but fewer than 100 cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 5 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (187), followed by Piedmont (57), Emilia-Romagna (19), Liguria (15), and Tuscany (10).

Italy is now 30 days post phase 2 initial opening up, and 14 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

[4] Iran: 157 562 total cases, 7942 deaths

Iran on Tuesday [2 Jun 2020] lamented that people were ignoring social distancing rules as it reported more than 3000 new coronavirus infections in a 2nd cresting wave. "The fact that people have become completely careless regarding this disease" was of great concern, said Health Minister Saeed Namaki. "They either have total confidence in us or think the coronavirus has gone. The latter is not true at all," the ISNA news agency quoted him as saying.

His remarks came as Iranian Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 3117 new cases were confirmed in Iran in the past 24 hours. This had brought the overall caseload to 157 562, he added. Infections have been on a rising trajectory in the Islamic republic since hitting a near 2-month low on [2 May 2020]. They were at their highest on [30 Mar 2020] after hitting 3186.

Jahanpour said the virus had claimed another 64 lives in the past day, raising the overall death toll to 7942.

The latest caseload was close to the highest daily count for the Middle East's deadliest outbreak of COVID-19. The government has largely lifted the restrictions it imposed to stem the outbreak that first emerged in mid-February [2020].

[As of 2 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 157 562, including 7942 deaths, an increase of 3117 cases and 64 deaths since 1 Jun 2020, an increase in daily newly confirmed cases from 2979 newly confirmed cases and a decrease from the reported 81 deaths in the preceding 24 hour period. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports almost approaching the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear there is now a 2nd wave most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 881 205 including 108 059 deaths, an increase from 1 859 323 cases and 106 925 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York State represents 20.3% of the cumulative case reports and 5.0% of the newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, showing a decrease in the proportion of cumulative cases and a decrease in daily newly confirmed cases. New York City had a cumulative total of 201 123 as of 13:00 PM EDT on 2 Jun 2020 (an increase of 576 newly confirmed cases since 1 Jun 2020, but twice the number of confirmed cases in yesterday's daily count), including 16 892 confirmed deaths (an increase of 10 deaths since 1 Jun 2020) and an additional 4757 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Illinois, Arizona, New York, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, Florida and Pennsylvania.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas, Michigan, Florida, and Maryland. A total of 35 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) when known.

COVID-19 update 124 [data as of 2 Jun 2020 12:00 CET]
-------------------------------------
[These data are changing daily and are hard to reconcile with data from previous dates. - Mod.MPP]

Situation in Spain:
After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 239 638 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 27 127 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, and Figure 2) [286 718 - Worldometer accessed 1 Jun 2020 18:06 EDT (GMT-4)]. The tables and figures are available at the source URL above.

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. While Table 1 shows 137 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, the change in numbers of total cases is 294 new cases in the past 24 hours. A total of 27 127 deaths were reported, unchanged from 31 May 2020 -- 2 days with no new deaths reported.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 13.32, again showing a continual slow decrease over the past 30 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases, Madrid has 68 960 cases followed by Catalonia at 59 035, Castile and Leon at 18 925, Castile-La Mancha at 17 310, and Basque Country at 13 513. In terms of population-based rates (per 100 000 population) over the preceding 14-day period, Ceuta is 1st with 41.28 followed by Catalonia at 32.25, Castile and Leon at 24.92, Madrid with 23.38, and Castile-La Mancha at 22.23.

According to Table 2, of the 239 932 cases, an additional 243 cases have been hospitalized over the preceding 7 days, and an additional 11 cases were admitted to ICUs over the past 7 days. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICUs.
