The porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) virus has appeared west of the Red River for the 1st time this year [2019].

Manitoba Agriculture's most recent update on the number of infected premises from 6 Jun 2019 shows the virus has been found in 19 farms in southeast Manitoba and 2 in south central Manitoba in the Morris and Lowe Farm area.

However, Manitoba Pork Council's manager of swine health programs Jenelle Hamblin told The Sun that 2 additional cases have been discovered in southeast Manitoba since that update.

"This April-to-June time period is when we typically see PED more frequently," Hamblin said. "That's when we had the majority of our cases in 2018." Hamblin said that Manitoba's 1st confirmed case this year [2019] was found in February.

PED, which is not transmittable to humans or other animals, is usually fatal in young pigs, while older animals can recover. Signs include watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. "It does affect them quiet violently," Hamblin said.

Hamblin said investigations are still being done by Manitoba Agriculture with assistance from Manitoba Pork to find the vector through which the virus is spreading.

The worst year for cases of PED happened in 2017, when 80 premises were found to be infected. Manitoba Agriculture's website lists there were 16 detected cases in the province last year [2018], all in the southeast.

Hamblin said the 1st steps producers should take if they suspect PED on their farms are to stop movement in and out of the premises and to call their herd veterinarian. Hamblin also advises producers to be careful when visiting outside facilities like assembly yards, abattoirs, and wash facilities.

"Try not to bring any contamination you may come in contact with home," she said.

Producers can also sign up for Manitoba Pork's Manitoba Coordinated Disease Response program [https://www.manitobapork.com/animal-care/swine-health/manitoba-coordinated-disease-response-mcdr]. This producer-only web portal allows producers to share details of outbreaks like area maps and biosecurity information. Producers must sign a confidentiality agreement and sign up on Manitoba Pork's website.

PED was first discovered in Manitoba in 2014. Other cases have been previously detected in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and Quebec. Alberta recorded its 1st case of PED in January of this year [2019], with 4 cases in total having been detected in that province.

More information on the current state of the virus in Manitoba as well as tips for maintaining biosecurity on farms can be found on Manitoba Pork's website [https://www.manitobapork.com]. Information can also be found in Manitoba Pork's "Chop Talk" email newsletter.

[PEDv has spread within the swine industry in both the US and Canada. In early 2014, an additional related virus, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), appeared in the US. Infections with these novel SECD (swine enteric coronavirus disease) viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in young piglets.

PEDv causes severe dehydration and diarrhea in pigs and is generally fatal in young animals. It does not transmit to humans or other animals and is no risk to food safety.

However, diseases such as this, impact all the workers with ill and dying piglets and pigs. While biosecurity is important, it can also take a toll on workers through investigations into where a biosecurity lapse could have occurred.

Thorough cleaning and attention to biosecurity of the premises are helpful in controlling these diseases. Viruses are impossible to see, and what cannot be seen can more easily slip through a biosecurity protocol. Someone forgets to wash the boots or the truck. It almost takes 2 people at a time to remember to do it every time until it becomes a habit.

This disease spreads easily, rapidly, and can be devastating to young pigs, which can have a long lasting effect on the price of pork in the province and the nation. We certainly hope this situation is resolved and does not spread. Furthermore, we hope this not a new strain of the virus representing an impending outbreak in other areas.

Finding it west of the Red River may indicate a relaxing of biosecurity on some premises, or is it a more robust disease making a vicious come back? Time will tell. We will watch. - Mod.TG
