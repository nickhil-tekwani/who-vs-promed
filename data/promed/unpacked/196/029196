Measles vaccination rates are rising in Germany but so is the number of annual infections. Unvaccinated children can be kept out of school and day care to prevent an outbreak of the disease.

Despite the introduction of tighter laws regulating vaccinations, not enough children are being immunized against measles in Germany.

According to immunization quotas presented by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), a federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention, all German states achieved a 95-percent vaccination rate for the measles vaccination. But vaccination rates averaged 92.9 percent for the decisive second measles vaccination and were not satisfactory, the institute said.

"It is irresponsible not to have children vaccinated against measles or to allow gaps in a child's immunization record," RKI said in a statement. "We need a nationwide vaccination rate of 95 percent for the 2nd vaccination in order to eradicate this infectious disease. Doctors, schools, day care centers, businesses, authorities and, of course, parents need to work together better. No one should die of measles today."

RKI registered 929 measles cases in 2017, which is almost 3 times more than the 325 cases in 2016. In the 12 weeks of 2018, 92 cases were reported.

Germans are taking a more positive view of vaccinations, according to a national study.

"Measles infection is by no means harmless. About a quarter of the reported cases must be treated in hospital. We see an average of 3-7 deaths a year due to measles or the measles-related disease SSPE," said Lothar H. Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute.

Since mid-2015, there have been tougher laws in place to improve immunization quotas:

All routine health checks for children and adults can be used to check a person's vaccination status. Unvaccinated children and young people can be temporarily excluded from attending a day care center or school in order to prevent an outbreak of the disease.

Parents must provide proof they have received compulsory medical vaccination advice before their child can accept a place at a day care center. Day care centers must report families who refuse vaccination counseling to health authorities.

However, despite concerns about measles, according to the RKI, vaccination rates for chicken pox and meningococcus have slightly increased.

The attitude towards vaccination has noticeably improved, according to statistics from the Federal Center for Health Education (BZgA). Five percent of the 16-85-year-olds surveyed had rather negative or worse view of vaccinations.

"We are basically on the right track, but consistent and targeted information is still necessary because people who are vaccinated protect not only themselves but also the community," said Heidrun Thaiss, the BZgA head.

Abstract no: O0060, How does the outcome of measles cases under one year of age differ from that of older cases, EU/EEA 2013-2017. Measles serious threat for babies, toddlers, unvaccinated youths, ECDC says
-----------------------------
The vast majority of measles cases in Europe were reported in unvaccinated patients, and children younger than 2 years old were at a higher risk of dying from measles than older patients, according to research presented at the 28th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ECCMID).

Presenting author Dr Emmanuel Robesyn of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm said they analysed data to support European states in reaching the recommended 95% 2-dose vaccination coverage. It also set out to determine any possible differences between society's youngest individuals and older populations when infected with the disease.

The study examined all 37 365 measles cases reported to the ECDC from 1 Jan 2013 through 31 Dec 2017. The researchers found 81% of all reported cases were patients who were not vaccinated. Most cases were in Italy, Romania, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, with each reporting more than 5% of the cases. These countries also had the most cases that had not been connected with importation of the disease.

The study also noted that 33% of the patients were hospitalised and 11% had pneumonia. Most cases, 81%, involved those who were 2 years old and older. Of the remaining 19% share, 9% were 1 year old and 10% younger than 1 year.

The rate at which patients died from the disease highlighted the impact measles had on the very youngest populations. ECDC's analysis showed that 1 in 1000 measles patients died, and of those, the greatest fatality was seen in the youngest cases. Cases in 1-year-olds were 6 times more likely to die compared with cases of patients who were 2 years old or older. Cases in infants younger than 1 year were 7 times more likely to die.

The findings are based on ECDC data collected in the most recent years in the EU/EEA, which can benefit communication efforts to tackle resurgence of measles in Europe.

The World Health Organization has set goals for the elimination of measles and rubella. One of the main actions to achieve those goals is to maintain high rates of sustained immunizations.

Public Health England is warning of a measles outbreak in Redhill.

There have been 34 cases -- 26 confirmed and 8 deemed to be probable cases -- since January 2018, mostly in Redhill but with some reported in other parts of Surrey and Sussex.

A further 23 people are being investigated as possible measles cases.

Public Health England South East has urged the public to ensure they are vaccinated and up-to-date with 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

West Australians are being urged to be alert to an increased risk of measles after 4 cases were reported in the past week.

That brings the total number of confirmed measles cases in Perth in the past month to 9, including 4 infants too young for vaccination.

Two of the 9 cases were infected in WA.

One was in a hospital emergency department, where one of the patients infected overseas had attended, and the other was in the Kalamunda area.

The Department of Health said the patient in that case had no travel history and no identifiable source of infection, suggesting there had been an undiagnosed case in the area, so other people might have also been infected.

[5] Japan (Okinawa): index case imported

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is closely monitoring an increase in the number of measles cases in Okinawa, Japan and appealed to the travellers and members of the public for vigilance and reiterated that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease.

According to the information from the Government of Okinawa Prefecture, there is an ongoing outbreak of measles since late-March 2018 involving a total of 65 confirmed cases (as of 18 Apr 2018). The outbreak was triggered by an imported case from Taiwan in late-March 2018. Subsequently, 64 cases have been detected in Okinawa, including 25 cases (39.1%) in Naha and 11 cases (17.2%) in Nago.

Among these 64 cases, there are 43 (67%) affected persons aged 20-49 years.

"Immunisation against measles is the most effective way to prevent the disease. People who intend to travel to Okinawa are advised to review their vaccination history. Non-immune individuals are advised to consult their doctors about measles vaccination, which is usually given together with mumps and rubella vaccines as measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine," a spokesman for the CHP of the DH said today (19 Apr 2018).

Those who have received 2 doses of measles vaccine or were confirmed to have measles infection in the past are considered to be immune to measles.

For those with incomplete vaccination, unknown vaccination history or unknown immunity against measles, they are advised to consult their doctor for advice on measles vaccination.

"As it takes about 2 weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide protection against measles, travellers are advised to plan and get vaccinated ahead," the spokesman said.

Pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy should also consult their doctor for advice if they are not sure whether they are immune to measles. If they are non-immune to measles, they are advised not to travel to Okinawa during the outbreak.

Local children aged under one year are not due for MMR vaccination under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme. As they are susceptible to measles, they are advised not to travel to Okinawa during the outbreak.

If people must travel to Okinawa with children under 1 year during the outbreak period, they have to consult their doctor for advice.

The CHP has been liaising with the World Health Organization as well as the Japanese health authority for further information and will continue to closely monitor the situation.

Locally, as of 18 Apr this year [2018], the CHP recorded 4 cases of measles infection affecting 4 males aged from 9 months-38 years. Among the cases, 2 were imported from the Mainland (1 case) and Indonesia (1 case), respectively.

The spokesman explained that measles infection is a highly infectious disease caused by the measles virus. It can be transmitted by airborne droplet spread or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected persons, and, less commonly, by articles soiled with nose and throat secretions.

A patient can pass the disease to other persons from 4 days before to 4 days after the appearance of skin rash.

In Hong Kong, children are given the MMR vaccine at 1 year old, followed by a 2nd dose at Primary One under the Hong Kong Childhood Immunisation Programme. The coverage of MMR vaccination in Hong Kong is over 95 per cent at Primary One.

Besides being vaccinated against measles, members of the public should take the following measures to prevent infection:

* Maintain good personal and environmental hygiene;
* Maintain good indoor ventilation;
* Keep hands clean and wash hands properly;
* Wash hands when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
* Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharge properly;
* Clean used toys and furniture properly; and
* Children with measles should be kept out of school till 4 days from the appearance of rash to prevent spread of the infection to non-immune persons in school.

Members of the public should consult doctors promptly if they develop symptoms of measles. Affected persons should avoid contact with non-immune persons, especially those with weakened immunity, pregnant women and infants.

For more information on measles, the public may visit the CHP's measles page (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/24/31.html).

They can also visit the Travel Health Service's website (http://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/eindex.html) for the latest travel health advice.

[6] Japan (Okinawa): index case imported
Date: Sat 21 Apr 2018
From: Tomimasa Sunagawa <sunatomi@niid.go.jp> [edited]


An outbreak of measles is ongoing in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan since 23 Mar 2018. As of 18 Apr 2018, 65 confirmed cases have been reported. The index case of the outbreak was a tourist from Taiwan in his 30s. He had travel history to Thailand from 1-4 Mar 2018, developed fever on 14 Mar 2018 while in Taiwan, and traveled to Okinawa by air on 17 Mar 2018. During his stay in Okinawa, he visited multiple sites including a crowded shopping mall and duty-free stores in Naha City, the capital of Okinawa Prefecture. He also visited several sightseeing spots in the northern area of Okinawa Prefecture through 19 Mar 2018. After being diagnosed with measles on 20 Mar 2018 by PCR, he has been isolated. D8 genotype virus was detected from his specimen.

According to the data provided by the Okinawa Prefectural Government (http://www.pref.okinawa.jp/site/hoken/eiken/kikaku/kansenjouhou/documents/masin300419.pdf, in Japanese), except for the index case, there are currently 64 cases (all confirmed by PCR), including an infant less than one year of age, all of Japanese nationality. About 70% of them are older than 20 years of age. While the earlier cases either had direct contact with the index case or were present at the same location as the index case, cases without an epidemiological link to a confirmed case are now being reported. The majority, and over 75% of the adult cases, had no or unknown vaccination history. So far, there have been no reports of fatal cases.

It is expected that the measles virus will spread among unvaccinated persons, including infants, over the coming period. Children in Japan are strongly advised to get vaccinated as recommended (the dose at one year of age and the 2nd dose before entering elementary school); in addition, all infants aged 6-11 months living in Okinawa with an increased risk of contracting measles are currently being offered an extra measles vaccine.

The Okinawa Prefectural Government is working closely with local clinicians and other authorities to respond to this outbreak and is reminding the public of the need for a very high measles vaccination coverage in the population (at least 95 percent with 2 doses of vaccine in children and young adults, respectively), to protect themselves, families and friends, and others in the community. The Okinawa Prefecture Government is also in close communication with both the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to share information and prevent further cases. NIID is providing summaries of this outbreak and related events appropriately (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/ja/id/655-disease-based/ma/measles/idsc/7990-measles20180419.html, in Japanese).

A 2nd case of measles was confirmed to have been contracted at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, which has prompted the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to label the case part of a disease cluster at the hospital.

The CDC confirmed 2 new cases of measles in Taiwan Sat [21 Apr 2018], an imported case from Thailand and a domestic case found at the Linkou hospital.

The man infected at the hospital is a male nurse who is suspected of having contracted the virus from a patient on 4 Apr 2018.

Given that just the day before the CDC announced the case of a 40-year old woman who also contracted measles at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, the CDC has deemed this situation a disease cluster and has asked the hospital to come up with response measures.

The hospital has assembled a response team to contain the situation and is currently monitoring 980 individuals that have come into contact with the measles carriers there.

With the 2 new cases of measles, 22 confirmed cases of measles have been reported in Taiwan this year [2018].

A local measles outbreak is growing. The Kansas City Health Department says there have now been 4 confirmed cases in Kansas City, MO.

The department said it plans to release more information on Thu [19 Apr 2018] about the cases and where the public may have been exposed.

Meanwhile, the Liberty Public Schools District notified parents in an email Wed [18 Apr 2018] that the Clay County Health Center confirmed a case of the measles for a Kansas City resident who attends Warren Hills Elementary.

"At this time, we believe that there was no measles exposure to parents, students, staff or guests at Warren Hills Elementary during school hours," a latter from the Clay County Public Health Center said.

In addition to those 4 cases, there have been 13 cases of measles confirmed in Johnson County, KS, 2 in Linn County and one in Miami County.
