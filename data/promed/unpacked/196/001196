Notes:
As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may
change over time. This means that previously reported cases may be
discarded after further investigation and follow-up.

(1) These 2 new probable cases, with onsets of illness 25 and 27 Feb 2003,
were identified retrospectively in the United Kingdom. They both most
likely acquired their infection in Hong Kong SAR and became ill and
recovered while in the Philippines.

[C] Update 79  Situation in China 12 Jun 2003 [edited]
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_06_12/en/>

Chinas Executive Vice Minister of Health, Mr Gao Qiang, and Dr David
Heymann, WHOs Executive Director for Communicable Diseases, briefed the
press this morning on the situation of SARS control in China. Also in
attendance were Dr Qi Ziaoqiu, Director-General of the Department of
Disease Control in the Chinese Ministry of Health, and Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO
Representative to China.

The briefing marked the first joint news conference between high-ranking
Chinese and WHO officials since the SARS outbreak began. The briefing
followed a day of intensive meetings during which WHO officials reviewed
data and statistics from selected provinces, voiced their concerns, and
received frank and detailed answers.

Dr Heymann praised the openness with which the WHO team was welcomed by the
Ministry of Health, and described the measures now in place to control and
prevent SARS as excellent. He cited the high level of commitment and
determination at all levels of the health system as largely responsible for
the dramatic recent decline in the number of cases seen throughout mainland
China.

One purpose of the visit was to determine how China had succeeded in
bringing down the number of cases so rapidly, and to encourage officials to
share their experiences with the rest of the world. Indications of the
effectiveness of control measures, cited by Dr Heymann, include the very
short time now occurring between the onset of symptoms and the detection
and isolation of cases, and the speed and efficiency of contact tracing.
Such measures are important as they limit the amount of time that an
infected person is capable of spreading the virus to others and thus bring
control efforts closer to the stage when the chain of person-to-person
transmission can be broken.

Other effective measures include systems for both passive and active
surveillance, such as fever checks at train and bus stations and airports,
a nationwide mass media campaign to inform and educate the public, and a
very large number of fever clinics to assess those who suspect they may
have symptoms. Weve seen that there has been a massive effort to
mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,
encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS
cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated.

Specific concerns expressed by the WHO team include the lack of a
sustainable surveillance system that can be relied on to detect the first
hints of a resurgence of cases, some delays in meeting WHO requests for
further information, and wide variations in application of the national
case definitions, which can lead to under-reporting of cases. Some problems
related to prompt sharing and analysis of data are considered to arise from
institutional and administrative problems, particularly concerning the
information flow from provinces to the central level.

Another major concern is the large number of cases that have no known
source of exposure, thus making it extremely difficult to trace patterns of
transmission. In Beijing, the number of cases with no known contact with a
SARS patient has recently increased from 50 percent to more than 70 percent.

In the interest of protecting against a further resurgence of cases, WHO
officials singled out strengthening of surveillance capacity as the top
priority. Experience to date has shown that a single case, especially if
highly infectious, can rapidly ignite an explosive outbreak.

With SARS seemingly on the decline for now, there is a great need to
strengthen the SARS control and surveillance system in China, said Dr
Bekedam. The system now in place grew out of an emergency response and has
to be strengthened for the long run. He expressed doubt that the present
system would be strong enough to hold back the tide when confronted with
a resurgence of the disease.

In his assessment of the long-term SARS situation in China, Dr Heymann also
stressed the need for systematic studies of the origins of SARS. We still
dont know exactly where SARS came from, or how it was transferred to the
human population. We dont know if this disease is seasonal and will
decrease this year but come back next year. Until proper research into
the origins of SARS has been conducted, it will be impossible to predict
when the conditions that first allowed the virus to jump to humans from a
suspected animal reservoir might be repeated in the near or distant future.

WHO initial assessments of the SARS situation in China, issued in late
April [2003] following a visit to Guangdong Province, expressed serious
concern over the lack of urgency in reporting cases of SARS in China, and
criticized the government for not immediately treating the outbreak as a
public health emergency requiring extraordinary measures for its
control. Dr Heymann and other members of the WHO team are now satisfied
that these measures are in place, at least for the immediate response to
SARS. Recent visits to selected provinces, jointly conducted by the Chinese
Ministry of Health and WHO, found a high level of public awareness of SARS,
its symptoms and mode of transmission, and the need for twice-daily fever
checks.

China is regarded as the epicentre of the SARS outbreak. The country was
home to the first cases, detected in mid-November of last year [2002], and
presently accounts for almost two thirds of all reported cases worldwide.
The WHO visit was arranged to secure reassurance that control measures in
this vast country are adequate to continue the downward trends in cases
and, equally important, to ensure that a sustainable system is in place to
detect and contain a resurgence of cases. WHO is also anxious to ensure
that the considerable knowledge and experience acquired in managing the
largest SARS outbreak on record is shared for the benefit of all countries.

The SARS outbreak has revealed substantial weaknesses in the disease
surveillance system in China. When investment in health infrastructure is
neglected, conditions are ripe for the unchecked spread of any
epidemic-prone disease, often at tremendous cost to a nations economy. In
the view of WHO, the surveillance system in China needs to be made more
flexible and capable of a much more rapid and consistent response to any
new infectious disease threat.

During the visit, Chinese officials expressed deep concern about the
countrys capacity to deal with the next influenza season against a
background of possible SARS cases. The presence of influenza could greatly
complicate the detection and accurate diagnosis of SARS cases, while also
increasing the caseload of suspect cases considerably.

The containment of SARS remains the overriding objective of WHO. If SARS is
not contained, the world will face a situation in which every case of
atypical pneumonia, and every hospital-based cluster of febrile patients
with respiratory systems will have the potential to rouse suspicions of
SARS and spark widespread panic.

In an earlier report, a WHO assessment team reached the following
conclusion: If SARS is not brought under control in China, there will be
no chance of controlling the global threat of SARS. Achieving control of
SARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as
China. Effective disease control and reporting are the cornerstone of any
strategy to do this.

[As of 12 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8445 probable
cases with 790 deaths reported from 29 countries. In the past 24 hours
there have been 13 new probable cases reported of which 8 were reported
from Canada, 2 each were reported from Taiwan and the Philippines (the
cases in the Philippines occurred in Feb but were recently confirmed
through laboratory testing conducted in the UK) and 1 was reported from
China. There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.

The report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a sobering
reminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the absence of an
immediately apparent epidemiologic link to other cases. It begs the
question at what point in time following presumed/apparent interruption of
transmission in an area that had had local transmission (greater than or
equal to 20 days, using the standard "2 incubation periods" for the
definition) an area can presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably
not due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control procedures can
be dropped. Not an easy question to answer given the observed recurrence
of active transmission in Ontario. - Mod.MPP]
