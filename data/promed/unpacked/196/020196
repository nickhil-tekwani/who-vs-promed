WEST NILE VIRUS, ZOOS - USA (02)

[Re: the newspaper statement in the preceding ProMED-mail post in this
thread:
"No one knows why West Nile virus has had such a large impact on the zoo in
Milwaukee, where the human epidemic has been quite modest. Wisconsin
accounts for only 28 of the nearly 2900 human cases reported to the CDC so
far this year, while neighboring Illinois and Michigan have had major
outbreaks, reporting 656 and 409 cases, respectively."]
The number of human cases in Wisconsin in general, or Milwaukee in
particular, may be irrelevant here. Milwaukee county does have by far the
greatest number of West Nile virus-positives in wild birds (only testing
_Corvidae_) in Wisconsin so far in 2002.

Also, West Nile virus first surfaced in Wisconsin in Milwaukee; there were
58 dead corvids in Milwaukee County in 2001.
As for bird-to-bird transmission, it is more than speculation but has only
been proven in a laboratory setting.
