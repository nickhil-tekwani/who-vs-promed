A cryptosporidium outbreak reported in south-Central areas of Sweden has sickened at least 40 and is being linked to the moving of cattle to summer pastures 2015, according to a Norran [Swedish Newspaper] report (computer translated).

The report notes the cases are associated with summer pastures in the cities of Hjo and Skovde in Vastra Gotaland County.

Local health officials are now warning parents about letting young children pet calves on summer pastures and immediately afterwards eating food or refreshments. It is important to note they are not saying to avoid the summer pastures, just stressing the importance of washing your hands immediately after contact with the cows.

Cryptosporidium, or Crypto, is a microscopic parasite causing a diarrheal illness. Common symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps or pain, dehydration (which is often most serious in the very young and the very old), nausea, vomiting, fever and weight loss. Symptoms usually begin 2 to 10 days after infection and normally last 1-2 weeks. Once a person is infected, the parasites live in the intestines and are passed in the stool.

[Calves are well-known reservoirs of _Cryptosporidium_ spp. The hypothesis offered above that the springtime release of calves to summer pastures results in sudden spread of Cryptosporidia on the pastures is interesting. It implies that the calves are infected with Cryptosporidia before being released to the pastures, which was confirmed by a recent study which found that Cryptosporidium oocysts could be detected in 122 (36.7 percent) calves from 29 (97 percent) of nursing herds in 2 regions in Sweden (Bjorkman C et al. Cryptosporidium infections in suckler herd beef calves. Parasitology. 2015 Apr 22:1-7. [Epub ahead of print]). - Mod.EP
