A new strain of bacteria has been found in the North, thanks to a
circumpolar health monitoring program [see link below] that is
uncovering bacterial infections that could otherwise have gone
undetected. About 31 cases of the _Haemophilus influenzae_ type a
[lower case "a" is correct] bacterial infection have been detected
across northern Canada in the past few years, including 2 cases in the
Northwest Territories [NWT], according to monitoring efforts by the
International Circumpolar Surveillance System.

Cases of infection from _H. influenzae_ type a strain have been
recorded by the surveillance system network, which shares such
information across most of the circumpolar North. The system has
[been] monitoring bacterial infections since 1999 from northern
regions of Canada, USA, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden.

"By designing a system that's looking at the North as a whole,
pooling our data for analysis, then we're able to spot some new
trends like this earlier," Dr. Andre Corriveau, the NWT's chief
medical health officer, told CBC News.

There is currently no vaccine for the _H. influenzae_ type a bacteria
strain, which can cause blood infections and meningitis. A different
strain of _H. influenzae_ [type b] underwent a successful vaccination
program across the North in the late-1980s and early-1990s, and now
that strain is extremely rare. Corriveau said he believes the _H.
influenzae_ type a was only spotted because of the recent monitoring.
Because of that research, he said scientists and doctors could one
day lobby vaccine manufacturers to develop a vaccine for that strain.

[_H. influenzae_ is a small, at times pleomorphic, gram-negative
bacillus that requires blood-derived factors for in vitro growth.
Strains of _H. influenzae_ may be either encapsulated or
non-encapsulated. There are 6 antigenically distinct capsular
polysaccharide types, designated a-f. Type b strains are important
invasive pathogens in non-immune humans, causing, for example,
meningitis, bacteremia, epiglottitis, facial cellulitis, pneumonia,
empyema, and septic arthritis. Before the introduction of conjugate
_H. influenzae_ type b vaccination in Canada and the US, this
organism was the most common cause of meningitis in children in these
countries. A dramatic decrease in incidence of invasive infections
due to _H. influenzae_ type b has occurred in countries following
widespread use of conjugate _H. influenzae_ type b vaccines in
infants and children since 1987.

Strains of _H. influenzae_ that lack a polysaccharide capsule are
non-typable; these strains cause non-bacteremic respiratory tract
infections, otitis media, and sinusitis, in addition to neonatal and
maternal sepsis.

Encapsulated strains, other than type b, are noted to be very unusual
pathogens (such as, type a was reported to cause less than 1 percent
of invasive _H. influenzae_ infections in a population-based survey
in the US -- Wenger JD, et al. J Infect Dis 1992; 165 (Suppl 1):
S34-5); although type a has been reported more frequently from
Australia and Papua New Guinea (Med J Austral 1990; 152: 234-40 and
Lancet 1985; 1: 1343-4).

In 1997, invasive infection due to _H. influenzae_ type a strains was
reported in 2 previously well indigenous Canadian children
(<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/97vol23/dr2311eb.html>),
and in 2001 in 5 epidemiologically unrelated, previously well
children in the US (Utah)
(<http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/108/1/e18>).
Some have speculated that serotypes other than type b might acquire
virulence factors and replace type b as important invasive pathogens,
as has the news release above.

Surveillance studies in the US, UK, and Switzerland, however, have
not shown significant increase in infections of children with other
serotypes (J Clin Microbiol 1996; 34: 560-3; J Infect Dis 1992; 165:
S34-5; and Pediatr Infect Dis 1998; 17: S204-7); whereas a study in
Brazil found an increase in the incidence for _H. influenzae_ type a
invasive disease through selection of circulating _H. influenzae_
type a clones, although the authors noted that the risk attributable
to serotype replacement was small in comparison to the large
reduction in _H. influenzae_ type b meningitis due to immunization (J
Infect Dis 2003; 187: 109-16).

Another very recent publication, from which the news release above
likely derives, analyzed population-based surveillance for invasive
_H. influenzae_ disease across the North American Arctic. The authors
identified a high proportion of non-b serotypes over the 6-year study
period, with particularly high rates of invasive disease caused by
_H. influenzae_ type a, 92 percent of which occurred in indigenous
people in Alaska and northern Canada (Bruce MG, Deeks SL, Zulz T,
Navarro C, Palacios C, Case C, et al: Epidemiology of _Haemophilus
influenzae_ serotype a, North American Arctic, 2000-2005. Emerg
Infect Dis. 2008 Jan; [Epub ahead of print]
<http://0-www.cdc.gov.pugwash.lib.warwick.ac.uk/eid/content/14/1/pdfs/07-0822.pdf>).

These findings in Brazil, Alaska, and Canada highlight the need to
maintain surveillance for invasive _H. influenzae_ disease in regions
of the world where _H. influenzae_ type b conjugate vaccines are
currently in use, to identify emerging problems. - Mod.ML
