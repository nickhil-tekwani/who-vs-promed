ENTERIC DISEASE SURVEILLANCE, HUMANS (03)
=========================================

I am mildly surprised that samples of human sewage taken before treatment are
not regularly assayed for a variety of pathogens as a standard practice. One
might imagine that this could be used to assess the levels of
gastrointestinal pathogens over a wide area at relatively low cost. I would
be surprised if a monthly sample would seriously overburden the Bacteriology
Department at a county hospital, even though the number of tests may be large
where they are not automated.
I would have thought that this would be of interest historically and might
identify trends. In addition, it does, of course, get around the problem of
people who do not go to a doctor or doctors that do not request tests.

[There have been many studies of bacterial and viral pathogens in sewage. As
I recall, most were done essentially one-time (or just a few times), simply
to determine what is there (i.e., what can be there). Given that sewage
sampling merely indicates what is in the community, not in the individual
(sort of difficult to sort out who's who when the samples are pooled),
results of regular sampling might turn out to be just a lot of crap. In the
mid-1980s a polio outbreak in Finland might have been short circuited had
sewage been tested on a regular basis. Instead, given that polio had been
"eradicated" in Finland, no testing of humans or sewage was done on a regular
basis and the first human cases served as the indicator system for the
outbreak. My guess is that the concept of testing sewage has been put forth
previously and rejected for lack of utility. William B. Baine's comments,
posted earlier today, are much more data based and epidemiologically useful.
