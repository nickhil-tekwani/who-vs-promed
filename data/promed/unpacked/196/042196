Report Provides New Details of Soviet Smallpox Accident
----------------
A Soviet field test of weaponized smallpox caused an outbreak in 1971
that killed two children and a young woman before health teams
disinfected homes, quarantined hundreds of people and administered
nearly 50,000 emergency vaccine shots, a new report asserts.
The outbreak struck Aralsk, a port on the Aral sea in what was then
the Kazakh Republic. The report says a ship doing ecological research
sailed too close to a military smallpox test that sent out a deadly
plume of germs, infecting a crew member who carried the virus back to
the city.
Moscow has never acknowledged the outbreak or that it ever tested
smallpox in the open air. But late last year, a former top official
in the Soviet germ weapons program spoke of the incident in an
interview with a Moscow newspaper, and Kazakh officials have recently
been investigating the outbreak's origins.
Now a team of experts at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies, drawing on formerly secret Soviet documents and interviews
with survivors, has written a report on the Aralsk outbreak.
The team says the strain of smallpox virus appears to have been
unusually potent and even sickened seven people vaccinated against
the disease. The episode, the researchers say, raises questions about
whether new vaccines or drugs might be needed if this strain were
used in an attack.
"We know that the vaccine works well in the vast majority of cases,"
Alan P. Zelicoff, a team member who is also a physician and smallpox
expert at the Sandia National Laboratories, said in an interview.
"What the new data strongly suggests is that we have much more work
to do on new vaccines and the development of antiviral drugs, none of
which are available today."
In envisioning a smallpox attack, terrorism experts consider
person-to-person contact a main threat. Members of the Monterey team
said the blowing of germs in the wind suggested that a contemporary
smallpox threat could be harder to combat and contain.
Dr. Zelicoff is to present a summary of the report today in
Washington to federal officials who are developing guidelines on
whether smallpox vaccinations should be offered to anyone besides the
few researchers who now work with the virus.
The three victims who died in Aralsk, Dr. Zelicoff said, were all
unvaccinated and developed the disease's rare hemorrhagic form.
Usually fatal, it is characterized by heavy bleeding and normally
accounts for one to three percent of smallpox cases. The seven
survivors, he added, had received routine vaccinations earlier but
nonetheless contracted mild to serious cases of the disease.
Vaccination usually bars the crippling illness.
"This outbreak did not have enough cases, thank God, to clarify"
hints that the strain was unusually potent, Dr. Zelicoff said. "But
it at least makes the questions legitimate."
Members of the Monterey team said federal officials grew wary this
week when told of the impending report out of fear that it would
undermine the national push for 300 million doses of smallpox
vaccine, the production of which is due to be completed late this
year.
In a conference call on Thursday, Dr. Zelicoff reassured health and
military officials that he would recommend more research rather than
changes in vaccine production.
His presentation is nonetheless expected to cause a stir at the
meeting today, which is public.
D. A. Henderson, a top bioterrorism adviser to the secretary of heath
and human services, said he was skeptical of the Monterey report's
conclusions and expressed confidence in the American vaccine. As for
the Soviet one, too little was known, he said, to assess its
effectiveness among Aralsk citizens in the 1971 outbreak.
"We don't know when they were vaccinated or whether they were
successfully vaccinated," Dr. Henderson said in an interview. He
added that the Monterey scientists were "jumping to far-reaching
conclusions with scant information."
No country has divulged outdoor tests of the smallpox virus, which
causes high fevers and usually kills one in three unvaccinated
people. The disease was declared eradicated from human populations in
1980.
The United States ended routine smallpox vaccinations in 1972 and the
immunity of those vaccinated before then is believed to have waned
over time. Today, the protection issue is back on the public agenda
as fears of germ terrorism have grown.
Only the United States and Russia now keep publicly declared stocks
of the virus. But terror experts say impoverished Russian scientists
may have sold the virus to foreigners.
Raymond A. Zilinskas, one of the Monterey report's authors, said in
an interview that American officials should try to obtain the strain
from the Russians in order to test the American vaccine's
effectiveness.
"They're going to have to open up," Mr. Zilinskas said of the
Russians. "We have to know what we're defending against." He added
that the Russians undoubtedly still possessed the strain.
The report was written with the aid of Kazakh officials, who blame
Moscow for the Aralsk outbreak. The document, a draft of which The
New York Times obtained, is to be made public late this month or
early in July.
Though it draws on old Soviet studies about the Aralsk outbreak, the
report does not directly tie the epidemic to weapon tests but infers
a link through circumstantial evidence and the perceived weakness of
alternative theories, such as a natural epidemic.
By 1971, it notes, the Soviet Union had reported no outbreaks of the
disease for a decade.
In an interview, Dr. Henderson suggested that a natural outbreak
might have carried the virus to Aralsk from Afghanistan, where
smallpox in 1971 was still endemic.
As evidence of a weapons link, the Monterey report cites an interview
with General Pyotr Burgasov, a former official in the Soviet germ
weapons program. Moscow News, a Russian publication, quoted him in
November as saying the outbreak was caused by field testing of 400
grams, or a little less than a pound, of germs.
General Burgasov said the crew member on the research ship picked up
the virus when it passed within 15 kilometers, or about 9 miles, of
an off-limits isle. The Aral Sea island of Vozrozhdeniye housed the
main outdoor testing area of the Soviet program to make germ weapons.
The smallpox test is said to have occurred on July 30, 1971, with the
ship sailing nearby between July 29 and July 31.
Aside from his comments, no details of the putative test are known
publicly. But scientists at the military base on Vozrozhdeniye Island
routinely exposed animals to deadly germs and measured agent
dispersal in open air.
These tests were legal in 1971, as no international treaty then
existed that banned the development of biological weapons.
In researching the incident, Dr. Zelicoff of the Sandia National
Laboratories was able to track down and interview the outbreak's
first case, who was then a young fisheries expert, as well as the
second patient, her 9-year-old brother.
Contrary to the official Soviet report, he said, she told him that
she never disembarked from the ship, the Lev Berg, before returning
to the home port of Aralsk. That, Dr. Zelicoff said, strengthened the
idea that she picked up the virus from the wind rather than from a
port of call.
As the youngest crew member, she told him, she worked most frequently
on deck. Her job was mainly to cast nets to catch fish, which she
then took below to a small laboratory.
After the outbreak began in Aralsk, health officials scrambled to
contain the disease, according to a formally secret Soviet report
reprinted in the Monterey study.
Nearly 50,000 residents of Aralsk were vaccinated in less than two
weeks, and hundreds were placed in isolation in a makeshift facility
on the edge of town where they could receive no visitors.
Travel to and from Aralsk was stopped, and many homes were
disinfected, along with 18 metric tons of household goods.
The Soviet vaccine of that era was generally considered as effective
as the American one.
In his section of the draft report, Dr. Zelicoff says the fact that
the Soviet Union never reported the Aralsk outbreak to world health
authorities "suggests a sinister source."
Another author of the report is Jonathan B. Tucker, a Monterey
official and author of "Scourge," a book on the smallpox threat.
The public forum where Dr. Zelicoff is presenting a summary of the
Monterey study is one of a series that the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention is holding to solicit opinions before two
advisory committees decide whether to change recommendations on
smallpox vaccination.
A policy decision is expected as soon as next week.

[This outbreak, which apparently occurred as a result of a bioweapons
research accident, underscores the risk of intentional airborne
exposure to smallpox virus. The ring vaccination strategy currently
endorsed by many public health authorities would have more difficulty
containing an outbreak with multiple simultaneous cases. However, it
should be noted that the Soviet officials were able to prevent a
large epidemic through mass vaccination.
ProMED-mail does not usually report outbreaks from the relatively
distant past, but the significance of this recent report and its
implications to the management of the ongoing biological weapons
threat, prompt us to make an exception to the rule. - Mod.LM]
