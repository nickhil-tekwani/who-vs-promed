Amoeba (_Balamuthia mandrillaris_) blamed in 2 more organ transplant deaths
----------------------------------------------------------------------
US health officials say 2 Arizona organ transplant recipients died of
an infection from a microscopic parasite they got from their organ donor.

The deaths are the 2nd confirmed cluster of transplant-related
encephalitis caused by _Balamuthia mandrillaris_, an amoeba found in
soil. It is especially dangerous to people undergoing organ
transplants and who have weakened immune systems.

The 1st cluster occurred in Mississippi last year [2009] [see prior
ProMED-mail posting Amebic meningoencephalitis, organ transplant -
USA (MS) 20091220.4298].

The donor, a 27-year-old male landscaper, died in Arizona in July
[2009] from what doctors believed was a stroke. A 56-year-old male
liver recipient died 17 Aug 2010. A 24-year-old male kidney and
pancreas recipient died 30 Aug 2010.

Another 2 recipients, one who got a heart and another a kidney, are
alive and without symptoms.

[The cases have been reported in MMWR (Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 17 Sep
2010; 59(36): 1182;
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5936a4.htm>). The cases
underline the importance of resolving undiagnosed symptoms in organ
donors like the prolonged skin lesions described in the donor. Skin
manifestation due to _Balamuthia mandrillaris_ has been described
(Martinez DY et al: Successful treatment of _Balamuthia mandrillaris_
amoebic infection with extensive neurological and cutaneous
involvement. Clin Infect Dis. 2010 Jul 15; 51(2): e7-11;
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/653609>).
The biology including transmission and a description of clinical
symptoms can be found in Schuster FL & Visvesvara GS: _Balamuthia
mandrillaris_. In: Emerging Protozoan Pathogens, Khan NA (Ed.).
