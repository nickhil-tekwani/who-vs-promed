Public health officers are investigating a severe outbreak of
salmonellosis after 30 people were diagnosed with the bug in a 4 week period.
The outbreak in the Tralee and north Kerry area means 3 times as many
people have fallen ill in Kerry in just a single month than all of
2006. The figures relate to July 2007 but it is understood the bulk
of the 30 confirmed cases occurred between 6 and 9 Jul 2007. By
comparison, there had been just 8 cases in Kerry in the first 6
months of the year and 10 in the whole of 2006.
It is suspected locally the cases may have originated in an
ingredient in a product sold in a food retail outlet. However,
officials would not confirm this. An outbreak control team is probing
"a possible" link to a food premises in Tralee. Management of the
premises were co-operating with the investigation.
