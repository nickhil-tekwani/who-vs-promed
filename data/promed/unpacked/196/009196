[Since the 1980s the incidence rate of
trichinosis after eating the meat of wild animals
has been increasing in the territories of the
former Soviet Union. The role of domestic pork
has decreased due to industrialization of pork
meat production and strong veterinary supervision.

Regions with a high incidence of trichinellosis
are: Krasnodar, Krasnoyarsk, Khabarovsk,
Primorsky, Altay, Kamchatka, Kaliningrad, Tulsk,
Irkutsk, Amur, Rostov, Tumen, Sverdlovsk,
Kemerovo and Jewish (autonomic)regions,
republics: Khakassiya, Northern Osetia, Yakutia.
Among other countries of the former Soviet Union
trichinellosis is found in Belarus, Lithuania,
Moldova, Western Ukraine and Ural region of Kazakhstan. Â­ Mod.NP]
