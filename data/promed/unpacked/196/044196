The Central Texas Audubon Society president has received a report of house
finches at a feeder in Waco with swollen, encrusted faces and eyes. This
event is believed to be the first report of the avian mycoplasm (_Mycoplasma
gallisepticum_)in Texas.
Samples are being collected from the finch to send to Atlanta for DNA
analysis to determine if it is a western or eastern race of the finch. The
disease in wild songbirds was first noticed on ProMED-mail in 1995.
