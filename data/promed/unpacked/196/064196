A 43-year-old resident of the village of Karadzhalo, Gardabani town in Kvemo Kartli region in southeastern Georgia is being treated for anthrax and COVID-19, according to a Sputnik News-Georgia report (computer translated). According to the Imedi TV channel, the woman, on the advice of a relative, consulted a doctor because of a wound on her arm. Tests confirmed she had anthrax.

"She came to us with suspected anthrax, as she had a wound covered with black film on her little finger. She also had a fever. We tested her for an ulcer and coronavirus due to her temperature. The tests came back positive for both coronavirus and anthrax," said Papuna Bakhtadze, director of the Rustavi clinic.

The woman is now isolated and is being treated for the 2 diseases at once.

[In due course, I expect that we will get more details about this woman's exposure. Human cutaneous anthrax lesions are usually on the hands, forearms, and occasionally the face; folk will scratch themselves. For women, this comes from handling meat from butchered anthrax carcasses. For the lesion to have a black covering, it would have been a number of days old, 2-3. A characteristic of these inflamed cutaneous lesions is that they are painless and itch; the lymph nodes in the arm pit would be enlarged and inflamed.
