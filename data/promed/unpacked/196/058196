Alma-Ata, September 11
An outbreak of anthrax has been reported in Akzhar, eastern Kazakhstan.
Seven residents have been admitted to the village hospital with symptoms.
The Public Health Ministry reports that they became infected as a result of
consuming lambs with anthrax. An epidemic-prevention team is now working
in the area. Premise disinfection is in hand. Village residents were being
medically examined. Cattle showing signs of diseases were being declared
unfit for human consumption and their milk was disposed of. The remaining
(cattle) were being vaccinated. According to the ministry there is no risk
of an epidemic.
This is the third anthrax outbreak in Kazakhstan over the past six weeks.
Earlier, two outbreaks were reported in Dzhambul region. At that time, 26
residents were affected and over 200 horses, cows and other livestock died.
A criminal case was initiated as the police regard such as cases of
criminal negligence. Cattle-breeders have been evading compulsory
vaccination to save money, although a single dose costs about 33 US cents
and vaccine is widely available.
[It is interesting to note that the Public Health response was reported,
but not the response of the Animal Health/Veterinary Service, if any. I
presume that the disinfection relates to the site where the lamb(s)
was/were butchered. That emphasis is placed on cattle vaccination ignoring
the ongoing patent risk of sheep & goat anthrax is not unusual,
unfortunately. Sheep & goat anthrax has long been a major problem in
Central Asia and the related Middle Eastern countries and is too frequently
totally ignored for social and political reasons. MHJ]
