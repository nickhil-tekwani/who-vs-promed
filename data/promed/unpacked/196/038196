I would like to comment on your report of the use of the Brazilian army for
the control of foot-and-mouth disease in the Amazon region: history repeats
itself.
Before the 1st World War, the control of foot-and-mouth disease in Prussia
was often done with the help of the army. Villages with herds of cattle
infected with foot-and-mouth disease were surrounded and sealed off by
troops. This was the only way to stop the movement of animals, or humans,
and prevent the spread of the disease. In Prussia, the Veterinary Service
was located in the Ministry of the Interior, and was called Veterinary
Police to give it the proper authority for unpopular measures.

[Dr. Bahnemann indicates that he was formerly at PAHO's Panaftosa (FMD)
center in Brazil. This center largely directed and coordinated the
substantial successes, witnessed over the last decade or 2, in the
eradication of FMD from significant areas in South America. His comments
reveal that he is well aware of the history surrounding efforts to control
and limit the spread of FMD. It is precisely because FMD spreads so fast
that precision, timing, and efficient allocation of resources -- qualities
often seen in military activities -- are the key to a successful disease
eradication campaign.
Calvin Schwabe, in his now classic Veterinary Medicine and Human Health,
provides a very engaging chronicle of the veterinary profession's military
roots. He traces the evolution of disease control tactics from Roman times,
when veterinary care of horses was a key to molding the far flung empire
into a single political entity, to USDA's Daniel Elmer Salmon, who
conceived of a campaign of mass action to eradicate Contagious Bovine
Pleuropneumonia from the U.S cattle population in 1884.
Salmon's reliance on a systematic program to find the disease and remove it
from herds, and then, eliminate infected herds from geographic areas,
paralleled a military campaign. Moreover, Salmon proved that a successful,
nationwide eradication campaign could be mounted with a handful of
veterinarians working with a small cadre of technicians, provided the
eradication effort was approached in a systematic, precise, "military type"
campaign. - Mod.PC]
