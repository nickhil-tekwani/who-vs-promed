OTTAWA, May 18, 2002 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- The Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Tiffany Gate Foods are warning the public not

Ontario as it may be contaminated with the bacteria _Shigella sonnei_.
The Greek Style Pasta Salad was produced by Tiffany Gate Foods and
distributed in Ontario, Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Newfoundland. The affected product was sold by grocery stores
and cafeterias including the following: A&P, Atlantic Superstores, Barn

product to other grocery stores, cafeterias and restaurants.
The Greek Style Pasta Salad supplied by Tiffany Gate Foods was distributed
in large commercial size containers and was repackaged into smaller size
containers or sold to consumers in serving portions at deli counters or in
restaurants.
Consumers who have purchased Greek Style Pasta Salad on or after May 02,
2002 to May 18, 2002 should enquire at the place where they purchased the
Greek Style Pasta Salad to verify if the store received the affected product.
The product is being voluntary recalled from the marketplace by the
manufacturer. This recall is a result of an investigation by City of Ottawa
Public Health, Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Quebec
provincial agencies and the CFIA due to reported illnesses.
Shigella infection can cause diarrhea (which may be bloody), fever, nausea,
and vomiting. Illness usually lasts from 4 to 14 days. In some persons,
especially very young and very old people and people with compromised
immune systems, the diarrhea can be more severe. Infection can occur after
eating and drinking food and water that is contaminated with Shigella and
can be passed from person to person.
Anyone who recently ate the affected product and has concerns should seek
advice from medical professionals and contact local public health departments.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is monitoring the effectiveness of the
recall.
