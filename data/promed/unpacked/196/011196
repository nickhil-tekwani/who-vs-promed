It is intriguing that the case worked in the Dominican Republic. We have dealt with 2 people who visited resorts in the Dominican Republic and were bitten by squirrel monkeys. Apparently, these moneys are kept at some resorts so that people can have photos taken with the animals, and they occasionally will bite. It can be very difficult to get reliable information on the vaccine status or health of the monkeys or their potential exposure to rabies. A wise precaution for tourists is to not pet the monkeys (or any other animals for that matter) at the resorts.

Hopefully, this fellow will recover, although the odds are not encouraging.

[It has now been confirmed that the Ontario patient is a human case of rabies virus infection, undoubtedly contracted in the Dominican Republic where the patient had been employed as a bartender and where he had developed the initial signs and symptoms of rabies virus infection. It has not been established so far how he contracted the infection. As suggested previously, the most likely source would have been a domestic dog or cat. Sequencing of the genome of the rabies virus isolated from the patient would help to establish the origin of the infection. It is unlikely that he would have encountered a mongoose, the other common vector of rabies virus in the Dominican Republic.

Dr Gould reports the interesting observation that recently 2 tourists have returned to Canada from the Dominican Republic having been bitted by (possibly tame) squirrel monkeys, another potential vector of rabies virus. In future, it might be advisable to offer such patients rabies post exposure prophylaxis. Some priority should be given to sequencing the genome of the Toronto patient's rabies virus to determine its host species of origin. Squirrel monkeys might be vectors of rabies virus or at risk of contracting rabies from domesticated animals. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP
