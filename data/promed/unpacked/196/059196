A 6th person in NSW [New South Wales] has been confirmed to have Japanese encephalitis (JE). Last week the state confirmed the 1st death from the disease, and officials are making a renewed call for people to take precautions against mosquito bites, which spread it.

The new case is a man in his 60s from the Balranald area in the Riverina region, close to the Victoria border. He's in hospital in Victoria.

NSW Health said "several" more people are being tested for JE. A man in his 60s died in February [2022] in Victoria from the virus.

There is no specific treatment for JE, and it can cause severe neurological illness with headaches, convulsions, and reduced consciousness in some cases. Symptoms typically occur 5-15 days after a bite from an infected mosquito.

Japanese encephalitis typically affects pigs and horses bitten by mosquitos carrying the infection but was detected in animals and humans in Australia for the 1st time last month [February 2022].

The mosquito-borne virus that causes the disease has been spreading in recent weeks, made worse by heavy rainfall and flooding on the east coast. The best way to prevent it is to try and avoid mosquito bites.

NSW Health advises avoiding going outside at dawn and dusk, especially close to wetland and bush, plus wearing long sleeves, pants, and shoes and socks.

[Transmission of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in eastern Australia continues with a 6th human case in New South Wales state. It will be interesting to learn if the several people currently being tested are positive for infection with this virus. This report and the previous ones comment on heavy rains and flooding. That will create ample breeding sites for vector mosquitoes and contribute to ongoing JE virus transmission in those areas. Avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure available currently in Australia.

Australia has a stockpile of 15 000 JE vaccine doses and has AUD 30 million (about USD 21.6 million) to buy an additional 130 000 doses. The authorities are currently establishing the priorities for people to receive the vaccine but apparently no vaccines are being administered yet (https://www.theislanderonline.com.au/story/7657152/find-out-whos-first-up-for-the-japanese-encephalitis-jab/?cs=12). - Mod.TY
