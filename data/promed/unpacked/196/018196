Saharanpur: mystery disease may be viral encephalitis
-----------------------------------------------------
A high level expert team that returned on the evening of Wed 4 Dec 2002
from Saharanpur has now said that the mysterious disease that has claimed
the lives of 46 children so far could be [a] viral encephalitis.
Director of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) Shiv Lal
and head of pediatrics at Kalawati Saran Children's hospital had gone to
Saharanpur on Tuesday morning to get first-hand information on the
mysterious disease that had affected close to 34 villages there. On
Tuesday, experts ruled out the outbreak being caused by Japanese
encephalitis [virus], a viral infection transmitted through certain types
of mosquitoes from birds and pigs. They said they suspected it to be an
outbreak of a measles variant that had occurred elsewhere in the country.
However, by Wednesday evening, NICD, which has yet to know the confirmatory
results, said that of the 51 case reports that they examined, at least 20
seemed to be due to [a] viral encephalitis. Other children with routine
seasonal problems, such as bronchitis and fever, had been admitted along
with those with the "mystery" disease. They added that there was no unusual
increase in cases for this time of the year.

[On the basis of this report, it would appear that there may not have been
anything more than a seasonal increase in various childhood illnesses,
rather than an outbreak of a specific "mystery" disease. Laboratory
confirmation of the diagnosis of a viral encephalitis is awaited. - Mod.CP]
