Disneyland has shut down 2 bacteria-contaminated cooling towers after Orange County [in U.S. state of California] health officials discovered several cases of Legionnaires' disease in people who had visited the Anaheim theme park, authorities said.

The 12 cases of the bacteria-caused illness were discovered about 3 weeks ago [October 2017] among people who had spent time in Anaheim and included 9 people who had visited Disneyland Park in September [2017] before developing the illness, according to the Orange County Health Care Agency. Their ages ranged from 52 to 94. The remaining 3 were Orange County residents who did not visit the park but lived or traveled in Anaheim.

Up to 10 were hospitalized and one person "with additional health issues" died, according to health officials. That person did not visit Disneyland.

Legionnaires' is a severe lung infection caused by exposure to contaminated water or mist. Authorities said they have not tied any other cases of Legionnaires' to Anaheim since September [2017].

"There is no known ongoing risk associated with this outbreak," the healthcare agency said in a statement.

The towers are in a backstage area near the New Orleans Square Train Station, each more than 100 feet from areas accessible to guests, a Disneyland Resort spokeswoman said [Fri 10 Nov 2017]. A Disneyland employee is among those who fell ill with the disease.

"On [Fri 27 Oct 2017], we learned from the Orange County Health Care Agency of increased Legionnaires' disease cases in Anaheim. We conducted a review and learned that 2 cooling towers had elevated levels of _Legionella_ bacteria," Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, said in a statement [Fri 27 Oct 2017],. "These towers were treated with chemicals that destroy the bacteria and are currently shut down."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified county authorities about 3 weeks ago of several cases of the disease among people who had traveled to Orange County in September [2017]. County epidemiologists discovered that a cluster of people diagnosed with the disease had recently visited, lived or worked in Anaheim and contacted Disney after learning that several of them had gone to the theme park.

According to the health agency, on [Fri 3 Nov 2017] Disney reported that routine testing had detected elevated levels of _Legionella_ in 2 cooling towers a month earlier, and the towers had been disinfected. Disney took the towers out of service on [Wed 1 Nov 2017], performed more testing and disinfection, and brought them back into service on [Sun 5 Nov 2017].

Disney took the towers out of service again on [Tue 7 Nov 2017] in advance of an order the health agency issued the following day requiring they remain down until test results verify they are free from _Legionella_ contamination. The towers had been turned off on [Wed 1 Nov 2017] before Disney learned that _Legionella_ had been detected, Disneyland Resort spokeswoman Suzi Brown said. "The only reason they were turned back on was as part of the further disinfection process."

The county health agency has also alerted healthcare providers to look out for Legionnaires' disease in anyone who may have become ill after visiting Anaheim or Disneyland before [Tue 7 Nov 2017]. It takes 2 to 10 days for symptoms of Legionnaires' to appear.

The disease is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria that grows in water and can spread when small droplets get into the air and people breathe them in, according to the CDC. Outbreaks are often traced to hot tubs, decorative fountains, cooling towers and large air-conditioning systems that emit water vapor into the air. Legionnaires' is not spread person to person.

The illness can be treated with antibiotics and hospital care, but about one in 10 people who get Legionnaires' disease dies from the infection. Most at risk are people over 50 [years of age] with weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases.

Orange County has recorded more than 55 cases of the disease this year [2017] and has seen the number of cases jump in recent years. A similar upward trend has been seen nationally and elsewhere in Southern California, according to the healthcare agency, though what's causing that is unclear.

[_Legionella_ species are found in natural and man-made aqueous environments and soil. Several of these _Legionella_ species are intra-cellular parasites of free-living amoebae.

Humans acquire these organisms after exposure to natural or man-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Aerosols can spread for distances outdoors wafted on air currents downwind from their source. In fact, "Broad Street pneumonia" was described in passers-by on Broad Street in front of the hotel, but who had never entered the Philadelphia hotel where the 1976 legionnaires' disease outbreak occurred (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00045731.htm).

The above news report fails to give certain details concerning this outbreak. Were all 12 cases infected by the same species of _Legionella_, and if so, did their genotypes match? Matching genotypes would establish a common source outbreak. Also did the species of _Legionella_ and genotype isolated from the suspected source (the facility's cooling towers) match that of the clinical isolates? Transmission pathways can be identified on the basis of matching genotypes for the clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources in this regard.

Out-of-state visitors to the Disneyland Park, the amusement park in Anaheim, California may not develop symptoms of Legionnaires' disease until they return home. If a detailed travel history is not obtained, the association with exposure in the amusement park will be missed.

Disneyland Park is the 1st of 2 theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. Disneyland Park consists of 8 themed "lands" and a number of concealed backstage areas, and occupies approximately 85 acres (34 ha). Its attendance in 2016 was almost 18 million (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland).

Anaheim, with a population of 336 265 residents, is a city in Orange County, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim,_California). - Mod.ML
