Further Comment on the Rodent Hosts of Arenaviruses
---------------------------------------------------
I concur with my colleague Heikki Hentonnen [see: Arenaviruses and rodent
taxonomy 20030411.0879] that the posting on Lassa fever of 9 Apr 2003
[Lassa fever - Sierra Leone 20030409.0863] was indeed an excellent
summary. However, I do wish to add a few details in order to somewhat
further clarify (though I may end up muddying) a few points on the taxonomy
of the rodent hosts. An even more up-to-date treatment of the taxonomy of
mammal hosts of arenaviruses (and, most importantly, of the taxonomic
problems) can be found in the following:
Salazar-Bravo, J., Ruedas, L. A., and Yates. T. L. 2002. Mammalian
reservoirs of Arenaviruses. pp. 25-63 in Arenaviruses I; The epidemiology,
molecular and cell biology of Arenaviruses, Oldston, M. B. A., ed. Berlin,
Springer, 197 pp.
At the level of rodent families, all are indeed found in Muridae (_Tacaribe
virus_ being found in bats, _Artibeus lituratus_ and _A. jamaicensis_,
family Phyllostomidae). New World arenavirus hosts -- with the exception
of _Tacaribe virus_ -- are in Sigmodontinae; Old World hosts in Murinae
(although this may change; see section 2.1.1 in the article above and
citations therein). No need to rehash here the contents of the article,
with one exception. In the concluding remarks, we wrote: "The underlying
theme of the foregoing sections is uncertainty..." There has historically
been a most unfortunate dissociation between virologists and mammalogists;
a dissociation that must at all costs end. For many of the arenaviruses,
we have no knowledge of the host, hence -- in my mind -- no knowledge of
the virus beyond its mere existence. Knowledge of the host carries with it
knowledge of the potential distribution of the virus, potential control
measures, potential measures to minimize contact between humans and natural
host, etc.
While it may truly be said that we know next to nothing of the true
identity of hosts of Old World arenaviruses, I will mention one specific
instance of some importance. On the theme of our current state of ignorance
with respect to the scourge of Lassa fever (100 000 - 300 000 cases/annum,
ca. 5000 deaths/annum): although most individuals would associate _Lassa
virus_ with _Mastomys natalensis_, this species of rodent does not even
occur within the West African hotbeds of Lassa fever. Likely candidates in
its stead were _Mastomys huberti_ or _M. erythroleucus_. However, _M.
huberti_ currently is constituted by at least 4 reproductively isolated
taxa, i.e., at least 4 distinct species. Which of these is the true host,
or whether it is _M. erythroleucus_ (whatever that may be), would make an
enormous difference in terms of the transmission dynamics of _Lassa virus_,
and consequently its epidemiology. Unless and until a concerted effort is
undertaken to elucidate the taxonomy of _Mastomys_, nothing will change
insofar as the epidemiology of Lassa fever is concerned.

[I hope that a consequence of my previous inaccuracies will be a speedy
resolution of the "unfortunate dissociation between virologists and
mammalogists" commented on by Dr. Ruedas. - Mod.CP]
