From: Niall Byrne <niall@byc.com.au>

I write to correct a minor error in the recent listing on RHODE. (Rabbit
Hemorrhagic Disease Virus), also called Rabbit calicivirus, did not escape
from a laboratory in Australia. This was an error made in a US press
release in 1995 by one of the project's critics.
The virus actually escaped from an island where field trials were being
conducted with wild rabbits. Fences had been built around existing rabbit
warrens on the island. The field trials were preceded by 3 years of high
security laboratory trials.

It may seem trivial but these errors repeated often enough become part of
the historical record.
