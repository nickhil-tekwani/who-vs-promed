The origin of the legionellosis outbreak in Juelich might be the Forschungszentrum. [Forschungszentrum is a scientific research institute in Juelich (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forschungszentrum_Jülich#Location).]

Initial investigations have found large numbers of _Legionella_ in the water from one of its cooling towers. Further tests will show whether the cooling system is responsible for the legionnaires' disease outbreak in Juelich. The cooling tower has been shut down and will be disinfected. Two other cooling towers at the research centre are free of _Legionella_. According to the local health authorities, the experts are surprised, as the facility is in good condition.

Over the last weeks, the number of suspected cases of legionellosis has risen to 60, of which 23 cases have been confirmed so far, while 20 tested negative. The laboratory results are pending for 17 other cases. All of the patients had pneumonia. The investigation has been ongoing for a week; the last confirmed infection occurred 10 days ago.

Samples are being taken from the [respiratory tract of patients] in an attempt to identify the pathogen and compare it to reference strains. Samples have also been taken from the research facility, as well as from other sources, such as sewage treatment plants, wastewater ponds, and streams.

[In a prior news report, the legionnaires' disease outbreak in Juelich posted by ProMED-mail (Legionellosis - Germany: (NW) 20140922.2792612), there were 42 cases of suspected legionnaires' disease, of which the diagnosis was confirmed in 5 cases and ruled out in 4. There are now, according the above news report, 60 cases of suspected legionnaires' disease, of which the diagnosis was confirmed in 23, ruled out in 20, and pending in 17 other cases. The suspected source is a cooling tower at a scientific research institute, which has been shut down. There have been no confirmed cases for the past 10 days.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

For a discussion of legionnaires' disease, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail posts Legionellosis, fatal - Germany: (BY, BW) 20100129.0314 and Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) 20130901.1916014.

Juelich is a town in the district of Dueren, in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jülich). Its capital is Duesseldorf and its biggest city Cologne. Four of Germany's 10 biggest cities -- Cologne, Duesseldorf, Dortmund, and Essen -- are located in North Rhine-Westphalia. The state is divided into 31 districts (Kreise) and 23 urban districts (kreisfreie Staedte). A map of the districts can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Rhine-Westphalia#Subdivisions. - Mod.ML
