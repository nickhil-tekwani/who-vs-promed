DENGUE, CASE FATALITY RATE
**************************
A ProMED-mail post

I have been surprised by recent statistics published on ProMED-mail during
the last few months.
It seems that, due to El Nino or any other cause, dengue epidemics [are]
much worse this year throughout Southeast Asia and in the Caribbean.
However, the death toll [case fatality rate - Mod.JW] varies from a factor
1 to a factor 50, according to different country reports.
Most deaths must of course be caused by DHF rather than regular dengue, but
in Southeast Asia, DHF is present in all countries, and this is not enough
to explain such a difference in number of deaths.
Another explanation would be that dengue is under diagnosed in some
countries, or over diagnosed in some others (could it be malaria instead?),
but again, that would not explain such a huge difference.
Are there any epidemiological reasons for DHF to claim more lives in [one]
country than in another where the endemicity is similar? Or is this simply
a matter of data accuracy?
Are there any official statistics about the deaths-to-cases ratio?

[We asked Ken Lam in Malaysia why there is such a disparity between
countries in case fatality rates in patients with DHF. Underreporting?
Poor treatment? Other?]
This has been a most worrying point and I keep telling my Ministry that I
am often embarrassed to quote figures like a 5-6% case fatality rate for
DHF in Malaysia when countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia
reported lower CFR. Are we not able to manage our patients?
I have come to the conclusion that the problem lies in the
under-notification of DHF in Malaysia. Clinicians do not classify dengue
infections, and if they do, it is not done following WHO Guidelines.
Also, in Thailand and even Indonesia, only DHF cases are made notifiable,
but in Malaysia we insist that dengue fever (DF) is equally important [to
report] for vector control to be [undertaken] immediately.

[It seems very prudent to report the first cases of dengue, rather than
wait for the appearance of DHF to institute control measures. However, it
is also important to adhere to WHO guidelines for the classification of
DHF, so that CFRs can be calculated that are comparable between countries.
I know that Ken is trying hard to get this done - Mod.JW]
