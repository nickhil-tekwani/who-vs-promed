[The following is some clinical information about three fatal cases who
visited the Infectious Disease Center of Osaka City General Hospital after
showing symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). This information
was [provided by Dr. Shiomi, who is a pediatrician at the Hospital, and
[who sends clinical specimens to our laboratory.
Case 1: Nine-month-old girl. She showed HFMD symptoms from July 11, 1997.
Her elder brother and sister also contracted HFMD. In the afternoon of July
14, she suddenly weakened and showed dyspnea, which urged her to visit the
Hospital. Six hours after the admission she died. Although lung edema was
observed by X-ray examination, no heart enlargement was seen.
Case 2: Fifteen-month-old boy. Although he contracted HFMD on August 17,
1997, his general condition was good at that time. In the morning of August
21, he became weak and visited the private clinic near his house. But, in
front of the door of the clinic, he vomited and his heart stopped suddenly.
He was sent to the Hospital to try to revive, but he died 4 hours after the
visit.
Case 3: Five-month-old boy. He had fever from September 25, 1997. In the
morning of September 28, he showed tachypnea and tachycardia, and was sent
to a emergency clinic where he was given artificial respiration.
Thereafter, he visited the Hospital. However, he died 12 hours after
admission. During the admission multi-organ dysfunction, such as
abnormalities of liver function and DIC, were observed. However, these
symptoms seemed to be secondary effects.
An EV-71 strain was isolated from a stool specimen of Case 3. Dr. Shiomi
commented that the clinical pictures of the fatal cases were very similar
to those reported from [Malaysia which suggested bulbar form paralysis and
lung edema were causes of death.

Comment by Dr Ken Lam:
This is a message from Dr. Okuno with the description of their 3 cases. It
is remarkable how similar they are to the 4 cases we posted earlier. Now
that Taiwan has confirmed through postmortem that EV71 is responsible for
their outbreak, it really seals the case.
Dr. Okuno has kindly agreed to send me the EV71 strain isolated from one of
their fatal cases for our study on molecular epidemiology and virus
movement. As we mentioned in [an earlier posting, we did detect
characteristic 5'UTR sequences in our strains which are different from
other published sequences.
Perhaps others who have EV71 isolates (fatal as well as hand, foot & mouth
disease) are prepared to contribute their strains to us for sequence
analyses. I think it is important to do this in the light of our findings
as well as the fear of the virus emerging elsewhere with the approach of
warmer months in the region.

[Charlie Calisher was handling the enterovirus 71 - Taiwan thread, but has
had to go to Germany for a conference. Like Charlie, I am not so sure that
EV-71 has yet been proved to be responsible for all fatalities in these
outbreaks. No doubt retrospective case searching will turn up similar
cases, not only in East Asia but also in other countries.
More lab specimens are urgently needed, and we hope there is a good reponse
to Ken Lam's request above - Mod.JW
