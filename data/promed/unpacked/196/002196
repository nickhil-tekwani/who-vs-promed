The departments of internal medicine and medical microbiology of the Northwest Clinics in Alkmaar, The Netherlands, have confirmed a case of _Bacillus anthracis_ bacteremia.

A 48-year-old woman presented to our emergency department with fever, diarrhea and a painful, red lump on her back. She had returned from holiday in Tanzania on the day of presentation. Six days prior she had visited a local tribe in Tanzania and had shared food with them, including raw root vegetables. She mentioned having fallen into some dry shrubs causing skin abrasion on her back; adjacent to these shrubs was an area where gazelles were slaughtered and processed. Diarrhea had started several hours after this visit.

Blood culture and fecal culture grew _B. anthracis_, sensitive to penicillin and clindamycin. Intravenous ciprofloxacin 400mg and clindamycin 900mg, both 3 times daily, was started after which the patient quickly recovered. She was discharged after 8 days with further oral antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin 750mg twice daily, clindamycin 600mg 3 times daily) for a total duration of 60 days.

Anthrax is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals, their carcasses or contaminated products. Clinical manifestations include cutaneous, pulmonary and gastro-intestinal, with cutaneous anthrax being the most common form of the disease. In our patient, the primary source of infection remains unclear; however, gastro-intestinal anthrax through the ingestion of raw root vegetables and cutaneous anthrax through the skin lesion are both considered probable.

Anthrax has been a mandatory notifiable disease in The Netherlands since 1976; until now only 7 cases of Anthrax have been reported.

[This is one very lucky Dutch lady. As her faeces were contaminated she had a gastro-enteric infection, and with a bacteraemia it was systemic. Normally within the 6-day time line this would have been lethal. All I can suspect is that she self-treated with antibiotics when her diarrhea started.

With the little information given she was probably orally infected from contaminated gazelle meat included in her meal, along with the raw vegetables; human infection from contaminated soil is less common than 'rare' -- it only occurs in Soviet time records of peasants hiding that they had eaten a dead cow. The back lesion could have been from her tumble and skin abrasion from scrub contaminated by blowfly vomit from them feeding on the nearby butchered dead gazelles. She had a singular adventure to remember with a lucky outcome.

Our thanks to our colleagues in Alkmaar for reporting it to us. Certainly not something we would have known about otherwise. However I would point out that prolonged oral antibiotic treatment, especially with ciprofloxacin, can result in _Clostridium difficile_ infections, and I speak from a near lethal experience. In fact 3 days of doxycycline is usually adequate to kill all the vegetative anthrax cells. From then on, you have to make sure that any lesions, e.g., abdominal cavity, are regularly drained of any fluids containing the anthrax toxins. The usual strains of _B. anthracis_ are very sensitive to antibiotics -- it had been checked for in this case -- and therefore prolonged treatment is unnecessary. You will note that this lady responded very quickly to the intravenous treatment. This "60 day" cipro-marathon came from some research decades ago with monkeys at Ft. Detrick exposed to anthrax spore aerosols and pneumonic infection. Somehow it has become lodged in the treatment manuals. Frankly it is unnecessary and dangerous.

Otherwise the only report of anthrax we have for the Netherlands was 13 Oct 2014 Anthrax - Netherlands (02): query contaminated meat ex Slovakia 20141013.2858901 in relation to meat from Slovakia. The last known outbreak reported by OIE in the Netherlands was in 1993 that involved some cattle that had been grazing a recently river flooded pasture and two related human cases. - Mod.MHJ
