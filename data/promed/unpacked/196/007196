98 People Infected with Meningitis in Chile
-------------------------------------------
Despite the discovery of 98 new cases of meningitis in Chile, the Institute of Public Health assures citizens that the infection has not reached epidemic levels.

These meningitis cases have been appearing "in a sporadic way," says director of the Institute of Public Health, Maria Teresa Velenzuela. The institute has asked that all labs deliver samples of the outbreak to them as quickly as possible in order to protect biosafety.

"Nowadays, we are not in an epidemic," assured Velenzuela. She explained that the cases have been appearing sporadically, and that there is only a danger of an epidemic when, "there are 3 cases of the same strain in a similar area within 3 months."

Both private and public laboratories have been notified of the importance of delivering samples of the meningitis strains as quickly as possible.

To date, 75 percent of the meningitis cases in Valparaiso are [due to _Neisseria meningitidis_serogroup B]. [Whereas,] in the Region Metropolitana area, 80 percent of meningitis cases are [due to _N. meningitidis_serogroup] W135. Many of these cases have, for the most part, been in children between the ages of 9 months and 4 years.

Currently there is no up-to-date vaccination for meningitis [due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B]. However, meningitis [due to _N. meningitidis_ serogroup B] only has a 10 percent mortality rate, while [that due to] W135 has a 20 percent mortality rate. Symptoms for both strains include high fever, headaches, vomiting, light-headedness, and severe confusion.

For more information on where to get vaccinated for meningococcal meningitis W135 visit the Institute of Public Health website for Chile.
