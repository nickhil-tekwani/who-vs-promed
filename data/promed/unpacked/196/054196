The Indian Veterinary Research Institute [IVRI], Izatnagar, has not found any trace of anthrax in the blood samples of the rhinoceros that died at the National Zoological Park in the Capital on Saturday [28 Apr 2012]. A scientist involved in the investigation at the animal research institute said on the condition of anonymity that both the blood smear examination and the tests conducted on a piece of the animal's ear have tested negative for the bacterial infection. The real cause of death, however, is yet to be ascertained, sources said.

Junior Raja, the 4-year-old male rhino, was reported to have bled from the ears and nostrils, which led zoo officials to suspect that he might have contracted anthrax -- a deadly bacterial disease which spreads through spores that can be inhaled, ingested, or contracted through broken skin of a carrier.

"We have communicated the test results to the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). They are also studying the blood samples of the dead rhino and any formal announcement on the presence of anthrax infection can be made only after that," said Dr Rishendra Verma, joint director, Centre for Animal Diseases Research and Diagnosis at IVRI where the tests were conducted. He did not confirm or deny the report that anthrax did not cause the death of the animal.

When contacted, National Zoological Park director, Amitabh Agnihotri said he had not received official communication -- the final report -- from IVRI yet. "I would like to keep up the precautions till tomorrow [4 May 2012], till I'm 100 percent sure that it's negative," he said.

A team of experts from the National Centre for Disease Control had visited the zoo on Monday [30 Apr 2012] and advised its staff on precaution measures. A large area around the display enclosure and holding area of the dead rhino, have been -- and will remain till all reports are in -- cordoned off. Staff in protective gear has been spraying disinfectants and fly-traps have been set up to trap potential carriers. These measures will remain in place till the IVRI report is formally revealed to zoo authorities.

Delhi zoo curator and spokesperson, Riaz Khan, said that some of the steps taken are part of routine procedure after any animal's death. This time, however, they had put all other animals on antibiotics as a "prophylactic measure" and sent 22 members of the cleaning staff to the hospital for screening. Zoo officials say they have not shown any symptoms of infection.

"There were 2 other rhinos, including Junior Raja's mother, in the enclosure. They had been kept separately in cages. Neither has shown any symptoms," said Khan. If all reports are negative, the rhinos -- the zoo is now left with 2, both female -- will be released back into the display area. The IVRI's test-result of course raises the question of what killed the animal. Khan says it could've been brain haemorrhage. If it had been anthrax, Khan said that it could have been controlled. Zoos in other states have had cases of anthrax before -- a male rhino had died of it at the Assam State Zoo at Guwahati in 2008 and it had claimed a hyena died due to the bacterial infection at Raipur in 2007. Cases of anthrax -- in humans and livestock -- have been reported from Orissa.

[I apologise for the belated posting of this negative report from New Delhi but over the past week the Indian press has been rife with conflicting reports. What afflicted this young bull rhino has yet to be declared. It has been ascribed to a heart attack (http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/delhi-zoo-rhino-died-of-heart-attack-and-not-anthrax/1/187118.html), or a brain haemorrhage (http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Delhi-Zoo-officials-allay-fears-of-anthrax-outbreak/Article1-849669.aspx), or even haemorrhagic septicaemia -- but the absence of any health problems in the other rhinos, and his mother shared who the same pen, make an infectious or toxic cause unlikely. In due course I expect we will be informed as to what killed this young animal. - Mod.MHJ
