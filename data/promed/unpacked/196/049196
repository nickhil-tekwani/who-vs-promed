[The following information has been provided by Maria Elena Santolaya M.D.
President of Infectious Diseases Chilean Society, Directory of Infectious
Diseases Chilean Society, and Jeannette Dabanch M.D. Head of Emerging
Infectious Diseases Committee, Emerging Infectious Diseases Committee, in
order to clarify ambiguity in the ProMED-mail post referenced below, which
concerned yellow fever vaccination requirements for travel to and from
Easter Island. - Mod.CP]

Yellow Fever Vaccination - Chile (Easter Island): Correction
------------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the information that appeared in ProMED-mail on Thu 11 Dec 2002
about Yellow Fever Vaccination Required for Travel to and from Easter
Island, the Infectious Disease Chilean Society has considered it important
to clarify that the Decree N=B0291 contains an error as it considered
obligatory vaccination for those travelling to and from Easter Island.
The only requirement that was recommended by our Society to the Ministry of
Health, is to declare obligatory vaccination against yellow fever for all
persons coming from endemic areas travelling to Easter Island. This decree,
which has not been implemented yet, is being modified by the Chilean health
authorities. This recommendation of vaccination is intended to avoid the
risk of introducing yellow fever virus into places where the mosquito vector
exists.
