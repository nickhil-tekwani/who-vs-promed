Laboratory tests have proven the virus detected on a poultry farm is of the low pathogenic variant of the H5N2 avian influenza virus. But even with this variant there is the risk of its developing into a high pathogenic form affecting birds. Therefore, the culling of the poultry on the holding affected was carried out and will be finished today [7 Dec 2015] followed by thorough cleaning and disinfection.

For the protection of all commercially or privately kept birds a protection zone covering 1 km [0.6 mi] around the holding is deemed sufficient. There will be no 3 km [2 mi] protection or 10 km [6 mi] surveillance zones.

Official veterinarians will visit poultry holdings in the protection zone to gather data, perform clinical investigations and collect samples for laboratory testing.

In addition, restrictions banning the movement of birds or their products from the protection zone are in place.

Poultry keepers are requested to use disinfectants and wear protective clothing and immediately notify the authorities in case of unusual findings. Poultry keepers who haven't notified the authorities of their animals must do so in due course, calling the official veterinarian at the district council Cham, 09971-78-224.

Information about further developments will be issued once the investigation into the outbreak has been completed.

The district council wishes to repeat the clarification that the virus confirmed doesn't pose any severe risk for human health. When handling poultry or poultry products, the already recommended hygiene measures are sufficient.

[The report above provides the information regarded "pending" in the Sun 6 Dec 2015 posting: "Avian influenza (205): Germany (BY) poultry, susp, st & path pending". Avian influenza has been promptly confirmed, the serotype is H5N2, the pathogenicity "low".

On 7 Oct 2014, the same serotype LPAI H5N2 caused an outbreak in a small holding in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, with similar control measures applied and the outbreak was quickly resolved without spread (see archive 20141010.2851453).

The OIE notification on the said event included the following epidemiological comments: "No poultry or poultry meat has been moved to other regions in Germany, EU Member States, or 3rd countries. All poultry has been destroyed and safely disposed of. Disinfection finished on 9 Oct 2014. Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per chapter 10.4 on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2014)".

Low pathogenic avian influenza virus is generally considered to be transmitted by wild or migrating birds and is characterized by the relevant seasonality. - Mod.AS
