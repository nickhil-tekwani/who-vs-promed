following an outbreak of Contagious Bovine Pleuro-Pneumonia.

sub-county, has lost 13 head of cattle since May.
The quarantine prohibited the movement of livestock, their products and
by-products from, to and within Ntoroko county.

[Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a List A disease of cattle
caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides_ SC (bovine biotype) (SC:
small colonies). It is manifested by anorexia, fever, and respiratory signs
such as dyspnea, polypnea, cough, and nasal discharges. Diagnosis depends
on the isolation of the aetiological agent. CBPP does not affect humans.
The main problems for control or eradication are the frequent occurrence of
subacute or asymptomatic infections and the persistence of chronic carriers
after the clinical phase. Further data and diagnostic procedures are
available in OIE's Manual of Standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines
