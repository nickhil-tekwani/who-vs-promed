[Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) is one of the most important viral diseases of farmed Atlantic salmon. For several years, ISA has been a recurring problem in Chile. Quantitative information provided by OIE's WAHID database -- detailed country disease incidence section -- shows that outbreaks of ISA have occurred in the primary production regions of the country: De Los Lagos, Aysen General Carlos Ibanez del Campo, and Magallanes (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail; to view the information on ISA outbreaks you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the region or country, and time period).

ISA virus in Chile was isolated in 2001 from coho salmon (_Oncorhynchus kisutch_). The 1st case of the disease was officially reported on 25 Jul 2007, occurring in a production center in the central part of Chiloe Archipelago. From that time on, the virus has been detected in Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) in other cultivation centers located in different zones in the regions of De Los Lagos, Aysen General Carlos Ibanez del Campo, and Magallanes. Since the disease 1st appeared, Chile's national fisheries service (Servicio Nacional de Pesca y Acuicultura or SERNAPESCA) has issued several surveillance and control guidelines (http://www.sernapesca.cl/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=588&Itemid=695).

The following information was provided by Dr. Alicia Gallardo, Sub-director of National Aquaculture programs, and Dr. Marcela Lara, Chief of SERNAPESCA's Animal Health Unit: "SERNAPESCA's routine surveillance for ISA is risk based. Under this surveillance program official samples were taken for ISAv testing, and virus was detected (HPR 7A) in a cage located in the north of Aisen near Melinka. Confirmation of this latest case of ISA triggered the biosecurity and surveillance measures established by Chile's official ISA Surveillance and Control Program. Measures included movement restrictions, depopulation of the positive cage, and enhanced surveillance in the affected zone. Additional measures included strengthening the biosecurity already in place, tracking shipments using satellite positioning systems and increasing control of the main risk pathways for disease spread, such as processing plant effluents, concentration points, and live fish movement." We thank Dr. Gallardo and Dr. Lara for providing this useful additional information related to this case.
