A total of 3 birds collected near a condominium complex on Staten
Island were submitted to the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic
Center and Anatomic Pathology. The birds were identified as grackles
(_Quiscalus quiscula_).
Generally, they were in good body condition with minimal lesions
noted grossly. A small amount of corn and other material was detected
within the ventriculus of each bird. Capillary GC/MS of extracted
stomach contents revealed the presence of 4-aminopyradine (trade name
Avitrol(R)). 4-Aminopyradine is an avicide [bird pesticide], usually
mixed with cracked-corn bait.
Clinical signs of avitrol toxicosis may occur within 12 minutes of
ingestion and include vocalizations [distress calls], loss of
muscular control, and inability to fly or walk. Birds may die in 30
to 90 minutes. Use of this product is currently illegal in the city
of New York.

The dozens of birds found dead in Great Kills and in Eltingville last
month [December 2007] were killed by an overdose of a toxic chemical
banned in New York City 8 years ago, the city's Health Department
announced tonight.
A sampling of blackbirds from Great Kills and starlings from
Eltingville were sent to the Animal Health Diagnostic Center
in Ithaca, NY, a little over a week ago.
City Health officials concluded that dead birds like these found on
the street and sidewalk at Richmond Avenue and Amboy Road in
Eltingville Christmas Eve were felled by a banned, toxic chemical,
Avitrol. Researchers found the birds consumed a toxic dose of
Avitrol, a chemical frightening agent used to remove birds from a
given location.
Birds eating the treated bait, such as corn kernels, will emit
distress and alarm cries and visual displays used by their species.
This will frighten the flock and cause them to leave the site,
according to the chemical maker's Web site.
In 2000, then Gov. George Pataki banned use of the drug in the city.
Approximately 50 birds were first discovered on 21 Dec 2007 along a
street in Great Kills. On Christmas Eve [24 Dec 2007], 7 starlings
were found dead on the corner of Richmond Avenue and Amboy Road, Eltingville.

Who spread chemical that killed Staten Island birds?
----------------------------------------------------
The state Department of Environmental Conservation has launched an
investigation to determine who was using a banned toxin to scatter
birds from Staten Island's South Shore, causing dozens of blackbirds
and starlings to die last month [December 2007] [For video see URL above].
State Department of Environmental Conservation spokesman Yancey Roy
said today that the agency is trying to pinpoint who may have used
Avitrol and where, but declined to discuss specifics regarding the
investigation and said that there are no immediate suspects.
Avitrol, a chemical frightening agent used to prevent birds from
gathering at given locations, has been banned in New York City since 2000.
The city Health Department first began looking for what caused 50
birds to die along Wiman Avenue in Great Kills on 21 Dec 2007. A
total of 21 and 7 starlings suffered the same fate on the corner of
Richmond Avenue and Amboy Road in Eltingville on Christmas Eve [24
Dec 2007]. The agency announced Thursday night [3 Jan 2008] that some
of the birds tested at the state Animal Health Diagnostic Center at
Cornell University in Ithaca had consumed a toxic dose of Avitrol.
Neighbors said that large amounts of pigeons often converge around
Richmond County Savings Bank's Eltingville branch on the corner of
Richmond and Amboy and some wondered if workers there are the
culprits. A bank manager said bank employees are not responsible for
putting out Avitrol.
Avitrol Corporation claims that birds that eat bait treated with the
chemical will emit distress and alarm calls and visual displays that
frighten and scatter flocks of birds. It is used by residents or
businesses who want to rid their properties of large gatherings of birds.
Ed Johnson, science curator at the Staten Island Museum and
coordinator of the annual Christmas Bird Count, said there are very
strict laws protecting migratory birds here and whoever put out
Avitrol should be punished.
"It's somebody who is bothered by flocks of birds and doesn't really
care" about the law, Johnson said, noting that the museum needs state
and federal permits to collect and examine dead birds for research
purposes. "If they find [who did it], they should prosecute them."
