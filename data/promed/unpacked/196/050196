Botulism outbreak, cattle put down
----------------------------------
About 200 cattle on a beef farm near Ecclefechan [Dumfriesshire] have been
destroyed after contracting botulism. It is the most serious of 4 outbreaks in
Scotland in recent weeks; the other farms were in Ayrshire, Aberdeenshire and
Perthshire. [See northern part of map at:
<http://www.uk-holiday-cottages.com/images/ukmap.gif> - Mod.JW]
Tests are under way into the cause, thought to center on cattle
coming into contact with contaminated poultry litter or animal feed.
Veterinary experts are concerned at the number of outbreaks in the
past month.
The Scottish Agricultural College's veterinary manager Douglas Gray
said cases like the Dumfries and Galloway one were rare. "Previous to
this, we have only really been aware of one confirmed outbreak of
botulism in cattle in Scotland, and that was about 2 years ago," he
said. "Obviously, having had a total of 4 outbreaks over this early
summer [2006] period is cause for concern.
Mr. Gray siad 2 of the outbreaks have definitely been associated with the
application of poultry litter to grazing ground." He added that in a 3rd case,
it appeared that a shortened gap between applying litter and putting animals
onto the land may have been to blame.
The SAC is urging farmers to be aware of the risks of botulism in
cattle that are in contact with poultry litter or animal feed
contaminated with wild bird or rodent carcasses. [see further].

Broiler Litter And Contaminated Feed Implicated In Recent Cases Of
Botulism In Cattle
-----------------------------------------------
SAC [Scottish Agricultural College] Veterinary Services is urging farmers to
be aware of the risks of botulism in cattle that are in contact with broiler
litter or animal feed contaminated with wild bird or rodent carcasses.
Although until recently relatively rare in Scotland, 4 cases of botulism in
cattle have been investigated by SAC in the last month [July 2006]. In 2 of
these outbreaks, contact with broiler litter was the suspected source of
infection. In the other 2 cases, the source appears to be home mixed feed or
silage which has become contaminated with carcass material.
This increase in Scotland follows reports of an increase, in recent years, in
the number of cases of botulism in cattle and sheep, mostly associated with
broiler litter, in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland. In some of these
cases, mortality rates have been high. For example in one outbreak in England,
88 animals in a flock of 230 ewes either died or had to be destroyed.
Ruminant farmers, poultry producers and veterinary surgeons are urged
to take precautions to minimize the risk of botulism through contact
with broiler litter or carcass material.
SAC has issued the following guidelines:
1. Guidelines for ruminant farmers:
- If at all possible, do not import poultry litter onto ruminant
farms [this, in fact, means that SAC apparently negates the feeding
of cattle with poultry manure, a rather widespread practice in
various industrialized countries. - Mod.AS].
- Move stock away from nearby fields, including those on neighboring
premises, if litter is stored or spread on fields.
- If using litter for fertilizer, do not spread on pasture used for
grazing or from which forage is conserved, and keep stock as far from
it as possible.
- When using as fertilizer on arable fields, plough in the litter as
soon as possible.
- If storing litter or feed components for a period on the farm,
these must be secure:
a. the storage facility should prevent access by scavenging birds and animals
b. site litter store as far as possible from livestock on home and
neighboring farms
c. comply with relevant environmental regulations (PEPFAA Good Practice Code)
d. store litter in a secure enclosure constructed with wooden sleepers,
concrete or earth walls
e. secure litter store once filled to deter access by scavengers, e.g. cover
with cattle manure and slurry, or use properly weighted and secured strong
tarpaulin
- Remove litter to arable land and plough immediately, avoiding a
period of storage on pasture when scavenging animals and birds could
gain access.
- Ensure that machinery used for litter is not used for storing,
mixing or moving feedstuffs.
- Do not use litter as bedding for ruminants.
- Adopt good personal hygiene when moving or spreading litter.
- Contact your veterinary surgeon if you suspect cases of botulism in
your livestock.
2. Additional Recommendations for Poultry Producers:
- It is illegal to dispose of litter with carcass material as
fertilizer (Animal By-Products Regulations).
- Ideally, remove litter from buildings and transport immediately to
an incineration site.
- If unable to transport off the farm immediately, securely store
litter after removal from housing, as detailed previously for
ruminant farmers.
3. Guidelines for Veterinary Surgeons
Suspect cases of botulism in livestock should be reported to your
nearest SAC Veterinary Services Centre for further investigation. SAC
acts on behalf of Food Standards Agency Scotland, who will carry out
a risk assessment in relation to potential threats to the human food
chain of such cases.
For veterinary surgeons whose clients are faced with the risk of
further outbreaks of botulism in ruminants, such as those with
broiler units who dispose of their own litter as fertilizer, or for
premises adjacent to broiler units, a bivalent _Clostridium
botulinum_ types C and D vaccine is available for use in cattle and
sheep. The vaccine can be obtained by applying to the Veterinary
Medicines Directorate for a Special Treatment Certificate (STC).
Application forms are available on line at <http://www.vmd.gov.uk>
under the general information/applications page. Further information
is available in Veterinary Medicines Guidance Note (VMGN) 7.
Notes for Editors
---------------
Botulism is an often fatal disease resulting from ingestion of
powerful neurotoxins produced by the bacterium _Clostridium
botulinum_. Multiplication of this bacterium with toxin production
can occur in animal carcasses and other rotting organic material.
Poultry carcasses which may be present in poultry litter are the most
common but not the only source of toxin for livestock. Affected
animals show progressive paralysis, usually affecting the
hindquarters first. They go down, are unable to get to their feet and
die. Treatment is almost invariably unsuccessful.
In England and Wales, a marked rise in the incidence of suspected
botulism was seen in 2003. In 2004, 22 incidents in cattle and 2 in
sheep were investigated, and in 2005, 20 incidents in cattle and 3 in
sheep were investigated. 7 incidents in cattle, and one in sheep,
have already occurred in 2006.
The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture & Rural Development
Veterinary Service has also reported more outbreaks, many associated
with broiler litter, in the last 5 years.

[Botulism is a highly fatal toxemia caused by ingestion of the toxin
of _Clostridium botulinum_. There are 8 recognized types and subtypes
of the organisms. Botulism toxins C and D, which are the ones related
to cattle, are generally regarded as non-pathogenic to humans.
Laboratory confirmation is difficult and not always possible; it is
based upon toxicity of stomach and intestinal filtrates in mice, but
a negative answer -- which is not exceptional -- is unreliable. In
many cases, the suspicion is based upon clinical observations of the
characteristic motor paralysis and the elimination of other causes of
motor paralysis. It will be interesting to obtain information on the
diagnostic methods applied by SAC.
The source of the toxins in broiler litter is generally attributed to
the remains of chicken carcasses.
Vaccines against _Cl. botulinum_ toxins types C and D in cattle and
other farm animals (small ruminants, horses) are available and widely
applied in countries such as Australia, South Africa and Israel.
