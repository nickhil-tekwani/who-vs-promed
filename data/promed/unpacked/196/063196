A cholera outbreak has killed 7 people and infected nearly 650 in the

Fri 25 Mar 2011.

A 43-year-old woman living in Pedernales, 205 miles (330 kilometers)

The fight against cholera is still far from over. It has emerged in
Lihir, New Ireland Province, where the 1st confirmed case was detected
and reported on Mon 28 Mar 2011 by the chairman for New Ireland
Provincial Cholera Task Force (NIPCTF) Alphonse Wena.

Mr Wena said an Australian working for Lihir Gold Mines was tested
positive after being rushed to the Lihir Medical Center following
severe diarrhea associated with continuous vomiting. The patient
received treatment and was isolated but is recovering in hospital.

Mr Wena said the expatriate's contacts were also screened and treated
despite their negative status. He said the cholera task force held a
briefing on Wed 30 Mar 2011 to address the issue to its members.

Tests in Port Moresby have confirmed a cholera epidemic in
Bougainville province, particularly the northern tip of Buka Island.
Already 65 cases have been treated at the Lemanmanu medical command
post.

15 cases required admission and have already been treated and
discharged. The death toll still stands at 2 but the disease has
spread across Gogohe and Hutjena and those affected were sent back to
Haku, where the disease started. The Cholera Task Force is now looking
at strict measures to contain the epidemic from causing more deaths
and to further prevent it from spreading all over Bougainville.

The age group most affected are between the ages of 10-15 year olds
and most cases reported revealed that more girls are affected.
Chairman of the Cholera Task Force in Bougainville Patrick Koles.

[6] Cholera - Pakistan (Sindh)

An 8-year-old boy has been confirmed with cholera in Mirpurkhas after
samples of 3 suspected cases were sent to Islamabad for testing.

Dr Kamran Ahmed, a public officer with the Disease Early Warning
System (Dews) which is part of the World Health Organization, told The
Express Tribune that 3 cases were being investigated. "We mainly look
into cases of acute watery diarrhea," he explained.

Such cases are at a point of severe dehydration and, therefore, of
primary concern, he added. Dews was formed in response to the health
threats from last summer's floods. The other 2 cases of a 12-year-old
boy and 7-month-old girl were provided oral hydration and have now
recovered, Dr Ahmed said.
