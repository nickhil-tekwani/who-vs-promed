----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following paragraph from the "New Scientist" was quoted in
ProMED-mail's post:

"Humans had a heavy hand in this. First the devils were wiped out in
mainland Australia by dingoes brought in by settlers, then those that
remained in Tasmania were hunted as pests, causing several population
crashes. As their genetic diversity was slashed, the devils were left
vulnerable to disease."

Dingoes are native to mainland Australia.
