Alex Donaldson [Pirbright Laboratory, UK asked me to compile a report of
the work we have been doing on the identification of FMDV strains. I have
placed a PDF file on our FMD web page:
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/FMDV_Molecular_
Epidemiology.pdf>
I have abstracted the key information on Type O Strain PanAsia --Topotype
ME-SA as follows:
Country / Date of identification
Cambodia / Jan 2000
Iran / May-Jul 2000
Japan / Mar-May 2000
Malaysia / Feb 2000
Mongolia / May-Jun 2000
(Nepal / Jun 2000 ME-SA but strain identification in progress)
Russia / Apr 2000
South Africa / Sep-Nov 2000
South Korea / Mar-Apr 2000
Taiwan / Jan-Feb 2000
Thailand / Jan 2000
Turkey / Jan 2000
UAE / May 2000
UK / Feb-Mar 2001
Other O type viruses were: (? indicates either no samples received at
Pirbright or work in progress)

[A deep vote of thanks to Nick and Alex for making this information
available. It is particularly useful, as the more trouble there is with
FMD, the more imperative it becomes that we distinguish which strain is
causing a particular outbreak. - Mods.MHJ/PC
