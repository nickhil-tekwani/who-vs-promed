South Korea on Thursday [15 Oct 2020] reported one confirmed case and 2 suspected cases of Japanese encephalitis, all 3 of them in Gyeonggi Province.

According to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, a woman in her 60s was diagnosed with the mosquito-borne disease on Wednesday [14 Oct 2020]. The 2 suspected patients are a woman in her 70s and a man in his 50s. All 3 started exhibiting symptoms such as fever and disorientation last month [September 2020], the agency said.

Among patients infected with the virus, only about 1 in 250 experience symptoms, the agency's data show. But as many as 20% to 30% of symptomatic cases can be fatal, and some might suffer permanent neuropsychiatric complications. The incubation period is typically between 4 and 14 days.

The agency recommends vaccination for people living near areas where the disease is most commonly found, such as rice paddies or pig farms, and for those planning to travel to Japanese encephalitis virus-endemic countries. Babies and children are universally urged to get vaccinated per the national immunization schedule.

Other preventive measures include using mosquito repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothes.

In Korea, the majority of cases are discovered between August and November. This year's warning for the disease was issued on 23 Jul [2020].

Of the 217 cases reported in the past 10 years, more than 90% were patients in their 40s or older. There were only 2 cases in children under 19 years old.

[These cases are not surprising since South Korea is within the endemic area of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus and cases occur sporadically there. Although the conditions under which the affected individuals acquired their JE infections are not given, it is likely to have been in an agricultural area where the mosquito vectors are common at this time of year and birds that are the reservoir hosts are present and breeding. Transmission of JE virus will continue until the 1st killing frosts of autumn occur. - Mod.TY
