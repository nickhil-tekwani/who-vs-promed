--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The post incorrectly stated Wisconsin as the location of the incident, and Wolf Lake in Lake County, Illinois. The deaths of the wild swans were reported from Wolf Lake, Lake County, Indiana (see https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/dnr-dead-swans-at-nw-indiana-lake-died-from-parasitic-worms). Diagnostic testing was conducted at the US Geological Survey's (USGS) National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin.
Our apologies for the error. - Mod.LM
