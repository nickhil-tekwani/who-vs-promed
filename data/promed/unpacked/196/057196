Steep rise in notified hantavirus infections in Germany, April 2010
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Faber MS, Ulrich RG, Frank C, Brockmann SO, Pfaff GM, Jacob
J, Kruger DH, Stark K]

Summary
-------
From January-April 2010, 396 hantavirus infections were notified in
Germany, a considerable increase compared with previous years (mean:
83 for January-April 2004-2009) including the record-setting year,
2007 (n=232 January-April). Most patients are residents of known
Puumala virus endemic areas in southern Germany. The recent increase
in notified hantavirus infections is probably due to an increased
population density of the main animal reservoir, the bank vole
(_Myodes glareolus_).

Introduction
------------
European hantaviruses of the family _Bunyaviridae_ cause haemorrhagic
fever with renal syndrome. Infection in humans occurs through
inhalation of aerosolised virus particles from excreta of chronically
infected wild rodents or, rarely, through rodent bites. Infection
with Puumala virus -- the hantavirus virus species most prevalent in
northern and central Europe including Germany -- leads to a
relatively mild form of disease referred to as nephropathia
epidemica. After an incubation period of 5-60 days, patients
typically present with abrupt onset of fever and influenza-like
symptoms followed by gastrointestinal symptoms. Acute kidney failure
requiring temporary haemodialysis may develop.

Puumala virus epidemics in humans occur regularly in several European
countries, particularly those in Fennoscandia [Scandinavian
Peninsula, the Kola Peninsula, Karelia, and Finland], and have been
linked to cyclic oscillations in the population density of the main
animal reservoir, the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_). In Germany,
typically 150-250 cases have been notified annually since 2001. In
2005 and 2007, however, the annual number of cases peaked at 447 and
1688, respectively. The outbreak in 2005 mainly affected the federal
states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony, including
increased numbers of human cases in urban areas, whereas in 2007,
when a record number of hantavirus [infection] cases were recorded,
most of the cases were reported from the federal states of
Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria.

Discussion
----------
The high number of hantavirus infections notified in early 2010, the
steep increase in April and the early rise of monthly case numbers at
the end of 2009 indicate that the case burden of 2010 may exceed
figures for 2007. Monthly case numbers also began to rise in the
autumn of 2006, peaking at 439 infections notified in June 2007, with
a total of 1688 cases in 2007. On the basis of data from serological
investigations and the geographical distribution of cases, the
elevated number of cases is likely to be caused by infections with
Puumala virus rather than Dobrava-Belgrade virus. Case numbers
presented for April 2010 should be regarded as a conservative
estimate because they do not include cases with pending quality assurance.

The high number of infections observed in urban environments requires
further investigation. Hypotheses include bank voles moving close to
human habitats due to an exceptionally cold and snowy winter,
increasing presence of the animals in periurban areas used for human
recreation (such as forests close to urban areas), as reported
previously for Cologne in 2005, or more basic shifts in the
epidemiology of Puumala virus in the bank vole population. The
increasing incidence in older age groups cannot be fully explained by
available data but is considered to be related to exposure rather
than host factors.
