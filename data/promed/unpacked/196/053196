A leptospirosis outbreak has been declared in Cagayan de Oro after 200
people were diagnosed to have the disease [leptospirosis]. 2 of the
victims have been confined at the hospital for 4 days due to
leptospirosis. The 2 survived the floods in Barangay [smallest
administrative division in the Philippines] Bulalang in Cagayan de Oro
but they could not escape the disease, which is transmitted through
floodwaters contaminated by urine from rats and other animals.

"I had a fever after 2 days. The fever goes away and comes back. I had
a headache and I vomited," [one of the hospitalized patients] said.
The Cagayan de Oro City Health Office has already recorded 200 cases
of leptospirosis infection, with 5 deaths. Dr Jaime Bernadas, regional
director of the Department of Health (DOH), said 99 percent of the
patients failed to get enough medicine.

The disease has an incubation period of 5 to 21 days. The DOH, which
declared the outbreak, fears the number of cases could still rise in
the coming days.
