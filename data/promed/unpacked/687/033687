Blackleg Disease Claims 5000 Cattle in Masvingo
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
More than 5000 cattle have died in Masvingo province since an outbreak of
the blackleg disease last month.
Ernest Dzimwasha, Masvingo Provincial veterinary officer, confirmed on Wed
25 Sep 2002 the outbreak of the disease. He, however, said there was
nothing his department could do to combat the disease, because the
veterinary department was facing an acute shortage of foreign currency to
purchase vaccines to cure [prevent - Mod. AS] the disease.
The disease causes some black spots on the legs of the livestock and
livestock affected by the disease die shortly after infection.
Said Dzimwasha: "The disease will continue to haunt the province because
the department is facing serious shortages of foreign currency and has no
money to purchase the vaccines."
Bikita, Zaka, Chivi, and Gutu are the hardest hit areas, and there are
fears that more cattle will die if vaccines are not made available.
Veterinary officers are reported to be out in the province to investigate
the cause of the disease, and some have blamed the current drought
situation as the cause of the outbreak. The cattle deaths come at a time
when Zimbabwe's beef supplies are dwindling due to massive destockings in
the commercial sector.
The 2001 cattle census gave the national herd as having been about 6.5
million, of which 1.3 million cattle were on the large-scale commercial
farms, while about 5 million were in communal areas.
It is estimated that the national herd stood at about 5.8 million 2 months
ago and had been reduced due to the destockings in the commercial farming
sector.
Commercial farmers, who export the bulk of beef in the country, are
down-sizing their cattle herd because of uncertainties caused by the land
issue.

[Blackleg is an acute febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by
_Clostridium chauvoei_ characterized by emphysematous swelling, usually in
the heavy muscles. It is a List C disease found worldwide. Most cases occur
in cattle from 6 months to 2 years old; contaminated pasture appears to be
a source of organisms. Blackleg does not affect humans. Vaccination, if
performed according to the prescribed regime, is safe and reliable. For
further details on the disease and its prevention, see moderator's comment
in ProMED-mail posting 19990806.1356. - Mod.AS].
