A child who was referred to J K Lon hospital here from Bansur area, Alwar, died on Monday [15 Oct 2012]. It is suspected he was suffering from viral encephalitis. He along with 6 other children had been admitted to J K Lon hospital on Sunday. Dr Rambabu Sharma said, "The test reports of the children are still awaited but they are clinically suspected cases of viral encephalitis."

One another child is serious and is in the intensive care unit (ICU). The doctors have put him on ventilator while the others are undergoing treatment in the emergency ward.

Alwar has been gripped by various diseases this year [2012], which has even taken the government off guard. Bansur MLA Rohitash Sharma said, "5 children have died in the area in last 2 days due to fever." Of the children who died on Sunday, 3 belonged to the same house. One other died on his way to Jaipur.

The doctors in Bansur's community health centre had referred the children to Jaipur's J K Lon hospital when they could not handle the situation. The community health centre did not have adequate equipment to take care of the little patients.

Meanwhile, health minister AA Khan also reached J K Lon hospital and directed the doctors to provide all facilities to the ailing children. He also met the parents of the children admitted to the hospital. MLA Rohitash Sharma too visited the hospital on Monday evening [15 Oct 2012].

The doctors said that viral encephalitis is caused by insect or mosquito bites [that transmit a virus]. Now, the medical, health and family welfare department has stepped up anti-mosquito activities in the area. Medical department sources said that directions have been issued to medical officials in Alwar to carry out fogging and other anti-larvae activities and other measures to kill mosquitoes and insects. The officials are conducting door-to-door survey in the area to find out if there are any more patients.

[The etiological agent involved in these cases is not stated, as is often the case in these reports of encephalitis in India. The acute encephalitis syndrome mentioned in the Uttar Pradesh (UP) cases is often associated with polluted water, suggesting one or more enteroviruses might be responsible. Other past reports have implicated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). The Jaipur cases, located far distant from UP, in northwest India, are associated in the above report with mosquitoes, suggesting (JEV) is responsible. In neither report is the vaccination status of the patients mentioned. India often mounts JEV vaccination campaigns in areas where outbreaks occur, such as the eastern parts of UP state.

At least 390 people, mostly children, were reported in an outbreak of viral encephalitis in UP this year as of 4 Oct 2012, according to health authorities. At that time, more than 2500 patients were admitted to government hospitals in Gorakhpur city (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20121005.1325059). Now, 11 days later fatalities have increased to 433.
