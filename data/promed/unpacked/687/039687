The presence of _Clostridium sporogenes_ in milk formula is probably not unusual. In a study in the USA published in the Journal of Pediatrics in 2010, clostridial spores were found in 7 of 9 market-purchased pediatric infant formula samples. _Clostridium sporogenes_ was isolated most frequently, followed by _Clostridium butyricum_ (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Barash+AND+Hsiah).
Tests for clostridia are not included in the routine microbiological testing of milk powder. It is likely that many cases of _Clostridium sporogenes_ in milk powder will be identified if we look for it hard enough.

As pointed out in the previous posting, _C. sporogenes_ cannot be distinguished from _C. botulinum_ without a test to detect production of the toxin. Both species give the same positive biochemical tests results. Commercial kits such as BioMirieux's API 20A will identify these organisms as _C. botulinum/sporogenes_ with a remark of "highly pathogenic organism." It is not clear which identification tests had been performed when Fonterra in New Zealand alerted its customers about the potential contamination.

Botulism associated with milk or milk products is very rare, and organisms identified biochemically as _Clostridium botulinum/sporogenes_ during routine testing of such products, in the absence of any reported case of disease, are probably best considered to be _Clostridium sporogenes_ until proven otherwise to avoid causing an unnecessary panic. Conversely, if such organisms are identified in any food item linked to a suspected clinical case of botulism, and even more so in an outbreak, it is better to err on the side of caution and consider them as presumptive _Clostridium botulinum_ until proven otherwise. When a microbiological test is known not to be discriminatory enough, it is important to take into account the clinical and epidemiological context.

[ProMED thanks Mohammad Issack for his comments. The abstract of the publication referred to (Barash JR, Hsia JK, Arnon SS: Presence of soil-dwelling Clostridia in commercial powdered infant formulas. J Pediatrics 2010;156: 402-408) is shown below:

"Objective: Because _Clostridium botulinum_ was isolated from powdered infant formula (PIF) fed to an infant in the United Kingdom who subsequently developed infant botulism and from unopened PIF from the same manufacturer, we tested PIF manufactured in the United States for the presence of clostridial spores.

Study design: 30 PIF ingested by 19 California infants with botulism within 4 weeks of onset of illness (48 percent of all patients fed PIF during study) in 2006-2007 were cultured anaerobically to isolate clostridia. All isolated clostridia were identified to the species level and enumerated with standard microbiologic and molecular methods.

Results: 5 of 30 (17 percent) PIF samples ingested by patients contained clostridial spores. Spores were also found in 7 of 9 (78 percent) market-purchased PIF samples. _Clostridium sporogenes_ was isolated most frequently, followed by _Clostridium butyricum_ and at least 10 other soil-dwelling clostridial species. No neurotoxigenic clostridia were isolated. The most probable number of clostridial spores in PIF ranged between 1.1 to greater than 23 per 100 g.

Conclusions: With the notable exception of production of botulinum neurotoxin, _C. sporogenes_ is physiologically comparable with proteolytic strains of _C. botulinum_, and both share the same natural reservoir (soils and dust worldwide). The isolation of _C. sporogenes_ and potentially pathogenic clostridia from U.S.-manufactured PIF suggests that neurotoxigenic clostridial spores have the potential to be present in these products."

This paper's conclusion is really the same as the moderator's. In the USA, recalls of commercially prepared food occur commonly when the production process could have allowed spores of _C. botulinum_ to germinate and produce toxin. Ingested spores generally do not cause botulism except in infants, the exact population to be fed the powdered infant formula. The persistence of spores of _C. sporogenes_ is, as the authors surmise, a surrogate that botulinum spores could be present as well.
