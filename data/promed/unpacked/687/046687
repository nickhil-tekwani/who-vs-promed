Flesh-eating bacteria have infected at least 5 men who were exposed to water in the Delaware Bay or who had eaten undercooked crabs from the bay since 2017. Researchers at Cooper University Health Care, where the men were treated, say the number of cases is increasing, though still relatively rare.

In an article being published [Mon 17 Jun 2019], in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the researchers caution that climate change could be a factor in the uptick. The cases should not cause alarm about eating local seafood or going in the bay, researchers and experts say. All victims of the flesh-eating bacteria had pre-existing conditions that made them more susceptible to infection.

One of the victims, a 64-year-old man who had eaten crabs, died; 4 others survived but underwent extensive treatment including amputation, skin grafting, or skin removal. "What is interesting is that in the 8 years prior to 2017, Cooper only saw 1 case of _Vibrio vulnificus_", Katherine Doktor, an infectious-disease specialist at Cooper, said in an email. "In 2017 we saw 3 cases, and in 2018 another 2. So while the infection is still rare, it is being seen with more frequency in this region."

_Vibrio vulnificus_ is one of about a dozen species of _Vibrio_ bacteria that can cause vibriosis illness, which can result in diarrhea and vomiting, according to the CDC. However, _Vibrio vulnificus_ can cause more serious illness, including severe blistering skin lesions and life-threatening bloodstream infections. Infected patients can develop a condition called necrotizing fasciitis -- commonly referred to as "flesh eating."

The bacteria live mostly in southeastern U.S. coastal waters and are seen in higher concentrations between May and October, when water temperatures rise. _Vibrio_ thrives in surface-water temperatures above 55 deg F [approx. 13 deg C].

[Delaware Bay is the estuary outlet of the Delaware River on the Northeast seaboard of the United States. Approximately 782 sq mi. [2025 sq km], the bay's fresh water mixes for many miles with the salt water of the Atlantic Ocean and is bordered by the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The publication, a letter to the editor, is authored by physicians in New Jersey and Pennsylvania: King M, Rose L, Fraimow H, Nagori M, Danish M, Doktor K. Vibrio vulnificus Infections From a previously nonendemic area. Ann Intern Med. 2019. doi: 10.7326/L19-0133. [Epub ahead of print]; abstract available at: https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2736101/vibrio-vulnificus-infections-from-previously-nonendemic-area?doi=10.7326%2fL19-0133.

The increased number of cases of this and similar diseases in more northern areas is a direct effect of global warming.

"_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

"Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis."

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: firstly, vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and, secondly, most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ may involve more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect. - Mod.LL
