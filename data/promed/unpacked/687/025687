The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture today [13 Nov 2013] issued a strict quarantine order after a horse stabled at one of the state's tracks tested positive for equine herpesvirus, type 1.

Some horses at Parx Racing in Bensalem, Bucks County, Pennsylvania came into contact with the positive horse and have shown clinical signs of the disease, ranging from fever to neurological impairment. The horses remain under quarantine until test results are completed.

There is no threat to human health from equine herpesvirus.

Barns housing the positive horse and horses showing signs of the virus are quarantined for at least 21 days. Horses must be free of clinical signs for 21 days and test negative for the disease before the quarantine can be lifted.

Under the quarantines, movement of horses on and off the track is restricted. Quarantined horses are not permitted to train and strict sanitary and biosecurity standards are enforced.

The highly contagious virus causes upper respiratory infection and severe neurological disease in horses.

Horse owners with concerns may call the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services at 717-772-2852.(Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture)

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
