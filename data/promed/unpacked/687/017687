[We have incomplete reports as to the possible events associated with these "3" anthrax cases during 2013. The Kyrgyz follow the Soviet pattern of tracing outbreaks when the Public Health authorities are informed of a human case. Thus, the majority of livestock outbreaks are going to be missed, though the custom is to slaughter and butcher any sick animal, with the potential for multiple human exposures. While they had an outbreak in Talas on the northern Kazakh border, most cases are in the west in the towns of the Fergana valley bordering Uzbekistan.
