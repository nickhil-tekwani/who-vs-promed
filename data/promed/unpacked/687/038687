In Bishkek, 5 cases of tick-borne encephalitis were registered, the Center for State Sanitary and Epidemiological Surveillance reported.

According to it, a total of 312 people turned to medical help with tick bites, and 19 of them received immunoglobulin. Among residents of the city of Bishkek, 5 cases of tick-borne encephalitis were registered, and all patients received treatment and were discharged from hospital.

The center recalled that tick-borne encephalitis is an acute infectious viral disease with a primary lesion of the central nervous system. Consequences of the disease range from complete recovery to health disorders leading to disability and death.

The causative agent of the disease (arbovirus) is transmitted to a person in the 1st minutes of sucking by a tick infected with the virus along with anesthetic saliva.

When removing a tick, it is necessary to tie it with a thread around its proboscis and, swinging the ends of the thread, carefully pull out the tick, and disinfect the bite site with any means suitable for this purpose (70 percent alcohol, 5 percent iodine, cologne).

It is possible to become infected with tick-borne encephalitis when visiting endemic territories in the border recreation areas of Chui region (Ala-Archa, Tepliye Klyuchi, Kegety Gorge, Tokmak forestry), when ticks are carried by animals (dogs, cats) or people -- on clothes, with flowers, when crushing a tick, as well as when drinking raw milk of goats (most often), sheep, cows, buffaloes. The virus may be in the milk of the animals during a mass attack of ticks.

Therefore, when visiting recreation areas, it is recommended to wear clothes with long sleeves fastened at the wrists with an elastic band, pants that must be tucked into socks, and the head and neck must be covered with a scarf. To protect against ticks, repellents are used to treat open areas of the body and clothing.

[Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a flavivirus. There are 3 subtypes: European, Siberian, and far eastern. Although there is no indication in the report above that the virus involved in the current case was subtyped it most likely is the far eastern subtype, transmitted mainly by _Ixodes persulcatus_. In a previous study, TBEV antigen was discovered in 1.5 percent of ticks removed from affected people in 2013 (see Tick-borne disease - Russia: (Kaliningrad) TBE & Lyme 20150324.3250475). A vaccine is available internationally. A prudent preventive measure is avoidance of tick bites by use of repellants, light-colored clothing (long-sleeved shirts, long pants tucked into socks), frequent inspection of the body for ticks, and avoidance of areas where the ticks are present. - Mod.TY
