A study appeared last week in the Journal Eurosurveillance [see Arafa AS et al. Emergence of a novel cluster of influenza A(H5N1) virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact in Egypt, 2014/15._Eurosurveillance_ 20(13) April 2015. http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=21085] -- [which has led to the Egyptian Ministry of Health] denying that any changes have appeared in the virus now circulating in Egypt.

Today the FAO has published details on 7 new H5N1 cases (listed below) which increase the total in FluTrackers' Egypt - 2015 WHO/MoH/Provincial Health Depts H5N1 Confirmed Case List to 135 cases since 1 Jan 2015. Fatalities, which are less often reported by the media and the FAO, hover around 40 -- although that number is probably low and will be adjusted in future WHO updates. This from today's FAO RSS feed.

1. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Giza, for human
2. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Suhag, for human
3. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Suhag, for human
4. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Kalyoubia, for human
5. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Kafr El-Shikh, for human
6. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Shrkia, for human
7. Confirmed Influenza - Avian in Shrkia, for human

As with Avian flu in China, Vietnam, and elsewhere, only the `sickest of the sick' generally show up at hospitals, and end up tested and counted. How many `mild' cases (or misdiagnosed severe cases) there might be is unknown.

While we've not seen any evidence of increased or efficient human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus in Egypt, it is concerning that this outbreak has now gone on for 5 full months, and that in excess of 160 people have been infected. This is -- by far -- the largest and longest human outbreak of H5N1 we've seen.

So we continue to keep a close watch on Egypt for any signs that the virus, or its behavior, has begun to change.

[To read more discussion of the genetic changes in H5N1 and the possible consequences, see ProMED Avian influenza, human (81): genetic changes H5N1 20150402.3274191. What is behind the more intense transmission of H5N1 being observed in Egypt this flu season is not clear, but may be related to the genetic changes that have been detected in circulating viral strains or greater numbers of poultry with infection, increasing contact of humans and naive birds with the predominant source of infectious virus. The increased level of transmission is concerning as it may lead to increased opportunities for the virus to reassort or mutate.
