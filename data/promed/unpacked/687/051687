The following abstract may be of some interest to current investigations on
outbreaks of West Nile fever.
INTERCONTINENTAL SPREAD OF WEST NILE VIRUS BY WILD BIRDS - RECENT
EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FINDINGS IN ISRAELI LIVESTOCK AND BIRDS

West Nile [WN fever is a flavivirus infection endemic in countries
bordering the Mediterranean Basin, the Indian sub-continent and central and
southern Africa. The pattern of epidemic WN fever in these three
geographical zones is highly sporadic. The most recent epidemic occurred
in Romania in 1996; it involved 393 patients of whom 17 died.
There are no reports of WN virus causing disease in domestic animals, with
the exception of the horse. In contrast, there is a considerable body of
serological evidence for infection of many species of wild birds and
animals. It is generally accepted that birds are the principal vertebrate
hosts of WN virus and that migration is the most likely mode of virus
dispersion. Of the Palearctic species, most migrating birds breed in Europe
and western Asia during the spring and fly southwards in the fall months to
overwinter in central and southern Africa. Most pertinent to our study is
that the route southwards traverses the countries of the eastern
Mediterranean, Levant [the countries of the eastern Mediterranean, from
Greece to Egypt, particularly Syria, Lebanon, and Israel - Mod.CHC, the
Rift Valley, Sinai and Egypt.
An epidemiological study of possible avian transmitters [hosts of the
virus was focused on the role of the White Stork (_Ciconia ciconia_). In
Israel, massive southward migration of hundreds of thousands of storks
occurs each year during the fall. In 1998, several dead birds were
presented for virological examination. By inoculation of baby mice and Vero
cells, three isolates were made from their brains. These were identified
using panels of monoclonal antibodies supplied by arbovirus reference
laboratories.
Serum from live storks caught in the same vicinity had neutralizing
antibodies to WN virus. At the same time, 18/24 serum samples from horses
suffering from a neurological disease syndrome also had WN virus
neutralizing antibodies. It appears that the seasonal incidence of the
Romanian epidemic of WN fever and the disease affecting the Israeli horses
may be linked to the migratory activity of the White Stork, and most likely
they were already affected with WN virus before leaving Europe. No human
cases of WN fever have been reported in Israel in 1998.

[Given that almost all mosquito-borne arbovirus infections in humans and
livestock in temperate regions occur in late summer-early fall, birds may
very well play a role in movement of these viruses. To say that the White
Stork is THE singularly most important avian reservoir would require far
more work than has been done. Nonetheless, with increased flooding and
other reflections of ecologic changes, there is little doubt that
mosquito-borne diseases, including those caused by WN virus, will be more
commonly recognized in the future. It is not the arboviruses that have
gone away, it is the funding and the arbovirologists, with some exceptions.
