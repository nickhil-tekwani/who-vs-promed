["The epidemiology of ASF is complex and varies depending on the environment, types of pig production systems, the presence/absence of competent tick vectors, human behavior, and the presence/absence of wild pigs. Routes of transmission can include:

- "direct contact with infected domestic or wild pigs;
- "indirect contact, through ingestion of contaminated material (e.g. food waste, feed, or garbage);
- "contaminated fomites, or biological vectors (soft ticks of the genus _Ornithodoros_) where present."

"Studies showed that 62% of the 1st 21 ASF events in China were related to swill feeding. Directives on banning swill feeding to pigs and record keeping of livestock transportation vehicles was updated. Epidemiological studies of 68 outbreaks revealed 3 major causes spread ASF virus: 46% by vehicles and workers without disinfection, 34% by swill feeding, and 19% by transport of live pigs and their products across regions."
