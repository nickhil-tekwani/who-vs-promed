Birds die on massive scale, sanctuary closed
--------------------------------------------
[Many] birds have died in the Bac Lieu Sanctuary in Nha Mat ward, Bac
Lieu town, Bac Lieu province the past week, said officials of the
local Veterinary Department on [15 Sep 2008].

An official of the sanctuary said some days they see nearly 30 birds
die in the sanctuary and the reason has not been determined yet. Most
of the dead birds are cormorants.

Veterinary workers have sprayed decontaminants in the sanctuary. Dead
birds have been tested but tests are negative for the bird flu virus.

As the number of dead birds hasn't decreased, the sanctuary has been
closed. The sanctuary has also asked the Veterinary Agency to help
them seek the reason for the bird deaths to protect rare birds that
are flying to the sanctuary.

One of the rare bird species that has just appeared in the sanctuary
is the grey-legged pelican. Bac Lieu Sanctuary is also home to 3
species of bird, which are named in the Viet Nam Red Book: Indian
panted stork, red-bellied pitta, and reddish Halcyon coromanda.

The community of wild birds in this sanctuary has increased to 78
species, including 15 species of water birds totalling 38 000-40 000 heads.
