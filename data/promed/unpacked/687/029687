Pigs, bulls die of unidentified diseases in Viet Nam
-----------------------------------------------
Some 200 pigs and 5 bulls have died of unidentified diseases in recent
weeks in Viet Nam's southern Dong Nai province, the local newspaper Labor
reported on Tuesday [23 Aug 2005].
Additionally, 1149 pigs, as well as 56 bulls and cows, in the Tan Phu
district are infected with the disease, with typical symptoms of diarrhea,
bleeding legs and watering mouth, the report said.
Most of the animals are supplied by a local trader.
The provincial veterinary bureau is researching the cause of the deaths of
pigs and bulls in the district. It is also clarifying whether the trader
has imported bulls from Cambodia or not, according to the paper.

[The clinical symptoms, probably observed and described by laymen, deserve
attention. In any event, FMD might not be excluded, since it causes
salivation, on top of lameness, in cattle ("watering mouth"), and, at
times, sloughing of pigs' hooves ("bleeding legs?!"). FMD may also cause
significant mortality in young cattle and pigs. The diarrhea seems to
belong somewhere else. Information will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
