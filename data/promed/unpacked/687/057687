The good news coming out of West Africa is that after a year and a half, we are seeing dramatically lower new cases; in fact, last week marked a 3rd consecutive decline in weekly case incidence.

Officials with the World Health Organization (WHO) report only 2 cases during the past week (one each in Sierra Leone and Guinea), making it the lowest weekly total to have been reported since March 2014.

In addition, for the 1st time in 3 weeks, no health worker infections were reported from any of the affected countries... - more]

[3] Sierra Leone: Ebola survivor meeting
Date: 7 Aug 2015
Source: CIDRAP [edited]

With Ebola survivors numbering about 13 000 in West Africa's outbreak region, many are left with sometimes debilitating chronic effects. Experts wrapped up a weeklong meeting today [7 Aug 2015] in Sierra Leone designed to take on survivors' issues. Global health experts are finding that nearly half of all survivors have joint pain, which can be debilitating. Inflammatory eye conditions, including uveitis, are also a common problem and can lead to blindness when severe and untreated. Other common issues are fatigue, headache, and mental health problems.

At a media tele-briefing today [7 Aug 2015], Anders Nordstrom, MD, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Sierra Leone, said recovery from the disease is a long, hard road for many patients, and the sheer number of survivors in the outbreak offers a unique opportunity to learn about the after-effects of the disease and how to manage them. "We hope the conference will lead to better support and better preparedness in the future," Nordstrom said.

Daniel Bausch, MD, MPH, with the WHO's clinical care team, said the meeting enabled experts to share their experiences about clinical care for survivors, researchers to compare data, survivors to speak, and groups to share insights on what social work strategies are useful. He is an Ebola expert from the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine in New Orleans.

Researchers at the meeting sketched out knowledge gaps that remain, talked about study protocols, and discussed how to build research capacity within the outbreak countries, he said.

Earlier Ebola outbreaks occurred on a dramatically smaller scale, and clinicians had only a few survivor case reports to guide them in their treatment of the conditions, Bausch said. The large number of survivors in West African countries allows an unprecedented chance to study the complications and devise possible treatments. "This is an emergency within an emergency," he said.

Researchers will also be looking at joint pain pathogenesis, with an eye toward developing new treatments or using ones that already exist. They said that for now, treatment is symptomatic. The experts noted that joint pain is also a common complication of other infections, such as dengue and chikungunya.

One topic on the research agenda is learning more about how the virus persists in immune-protected areas such as the eyes and testes. Sexual transmission in Ebola survivors is strongly suspected in a few cases, and Bausch said such infections don't appear to be occurring frequently.

He said, however, that studies are underway in all 3 countries to explore viral persistence in semen, with preliminary evidence suggesting that it can last hundreds of days. It's difficult to tease out how common live viruses are in semen, he added, because the work must be done in biosafety level 4 labs, which the outbreak countries don't have, and it's a laborious process to ship samples to facilities that can safety handle them. Alie Wurie, MD, with Sierra Leone's health ministry, said studies are being expanded to look at the virus in other body fluids.

Outbreak countries have amassed a wealth of biological samples during the Ebola epidemic, and researchers started discussions on how to organize and ethically use them.

Bausch said the issue of biobanking -- or creating large repositories of biological samples -- is in early discussions, but there are grassroots efforts underway in all 3 countries. He said that outbreak nations need to be the drivers of managing the samples to ensure their availability in a reliable and responsible way that protects stakeholders, including the patients themselves, and ensures shared access to the information gained from the specimens. Wurie said that, as a result of the WHO meeting, Sierra Leone's health ministry will start talks on biobanking next week.

[4] Post-Ebola virus disease
Date: 8 Aug 2015
Source: Ian M Mackay blog [edited]
http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/2015/08/post-ebola-syndrome-or-just-chronic.html


There are at least 13 000 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone who have survived an encounter with the Makona variant of Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) since December 2013.(1) But that's not where the story, or the suffering, ends for these people.

Following the resolution of acute Ebola virus disease (EVD), there is the spectre of a lengthy period of subsequent symptoms, sometimes called post-Ebola syndrome (I'd prefer post-Ebola virus disease syndrome or PEVDS), which is similar to that found among survivors from past outbreaks.(2,3)

In Uganda in 2007, EVD survivors were more likely than controls to suffer from retro-orbital pain, blurred vision, hearing loss, neurological abnormalities, sleep disturbance, arthralgias (joint pains), memory loss, confusion, difficulty swallowing and chronic health problems.(4,5) These sequelae can reportedly persist for more than 2 years.(4)

In West Africa up to 50 percent of EVD survivors report these and other symptoms as well as fatigue, pressure in the eyes, uveitis (eye inflammation), blindness, hair loss, myalgias, swelling, menstrual irregularities, rashes and shooting pains.(6-11) Eye problems have been reported in around a quarter of survivors.(11) Anorexia was reported by 98 percent of survivors in a study of 105 participants with joint pain (87 percent) and back pain (46 percent) also common.(12) This study also reported difficulty in short-term memory (27 percent), headaches (22 percent), sleep difficulties (19 percent), insomnia (13 percent), dizziness (11 percent), abdominal pain (32 percent), constipation (14 percent), decreased exercise tolerance (77 percent), decreased libido (23 percent), and sexual dysfunction (20 percent).(12) There are also issues of stigmatisation, psychosomatic illness and a broader psychological impact among survivors, including depression and post-traumatic stress.(9,12)

In at least a few of these instances of PEVDS, viral genome or infectious virus has been detected, sometimes at the site of disease, the eye for example.(13) Because of this persistence of infectious virus at the peripheries and because of chronic pain, ongoing symptoms of acute disease and also the progression of disease as new symptoms, it may be prudent to stop calling this a post-EVD syndrome and recognise this as part of EVD, redefining EVD into an acute phase and a chronic phase.

Much more work is needed to understand what causes the symptoms of chronic and evolving EVD. Some knowledge about the pathogenesis and transmission risks of EBOV is still lacking along with the lack of capacity in Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone to culture infectious virus. Physical containment (PC) or biosafety level (BSL) 4 laboratories are not available in West Africa, but are needed to work with known, high concentration samples and pure cultures of EBOV. That requirement appears a little excessive given the large number of humans who have hosted, cared for, tested or otherwise handled massive EBOV loads over the past 20 months, but responding to a crisis and planning to do research (also a much slower process) are 2 very different beasts.

Keep in mind that one privileged site, the testes, has not been a cause -- as far as we know and have actively looked for -- of more than a tiny number of EVD cases.(14) We can of course academically argue that any case is one case too many and that one case is all that started this epidemic, but it would be helpful to have a better idea of the true infection risk posed by EBOV in these immune privileged sites, based on the published results of more testing.

In the case of EBOV in the eye, tear fluids were not found to contain viral RNA, so infectious virus does not seem to be a significant risk to other people if contained within an intact infected eyeball apart from causing ocular disease, but that is based on a single case study.

Apart from testes and the eye (perhaps the foetus/placenta), are any other fluids or tissues harbouring infectious EBOV for extended periods? Could synovial fluid be to joint pain what aqueous humour is to eye problems? Can we assume persistent viral RNA detection equates to replicating infectious virus (yes, in my opinion)? What is the frequency of persistent infection among the 13 000 survivors? Exactly what anatomical and host factors are involved in persistent infection? Just how long does virus replicate after the acute signs and symptoms of disease have cleared?

Other viruses, for example dengue virus and chikungunya virus, are known to cause chronic joint issues, so this is not totally new ground, but the pathogenesis of that disease is also not nailed down. So, how will new chronic EVD knowledge be useful for other virus infections, including those that we may have not yet have considered to play similar roles at immune privileged sites or may not be typically associated with post-acute disease signs and symptoms?

In June 2015, the National Institutes of Health in the United States launched the Partnership for Research on Ebola Virus in Liberia (PREVAIL) III study in partnership with Liberia's Ministry of Health aiming to understand the long-term health implications of EVD.(15-17) There is a similar study in Guinea.(18)

As you'd expect, there are not yet any specific licensed antiviral treatments in routine use for persistent Ebola virus infection, just as there are none for acute EVD. But supportive treatment -- treating the symptoms of disease rather than the underlying viral (or whatever) cause -- is ongoing. Anti-inflammatory eye drops are used...but with caution.(11)

The EBOV epidemic keeps teaching us new things, a very costly education.

The victim contracted the disease in the capital, traveled to his home village, and was treated for a fever at the local hospital but authorities didn't call the Ebola emergency number.
