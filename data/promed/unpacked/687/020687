PC4 Laboratories in Australia:
Further to your postings "P4 labs worldwide 1-5", there are two physical
containment level 4 (PC4) laboratories situated in Australia, both in the
State of Victoria, and with complementary roles.
The National High Security Quarantine Laboratory (NHSQL) is located at the
Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in North
Melbourne, Victoria. This lab is responsible for virological testing of
samples referred from patients with suspected haemorrhagic fever from all
Australian States. Tests include isolation of viruses in Vero E6 and other
appropriate cell lines, immunofluorescence tests for antibody to
Congo-Crimean, Rift Valley, Ebola, Lassa, Marburg and Hantaan viruses, PCR
detection of Ebola, Lassa and Marburg virus nucleic acid and laboratory
tests for other infectious diseases on the differential diagnosis as
indicated.
