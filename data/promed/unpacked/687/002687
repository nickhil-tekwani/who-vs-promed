BSE PREVENTION - JAPAN (02): US BEEF BAN

I would like to inform you of your misunderstanding concerning the ban on
US beef by Japan.
There is no misunderstanding between the Japanese and US governments
regarding the maximum age for importing cattle. There is only a difference
of opinion between Japan and the US regarding the definition of specified
risk materials (SRMs).
The USDA defines SRMs as: (1) the brain, skull, eyes, trigeminal ganglia,
spinal cord, vertebral column, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of cattle 30
months of age and older, and (2) the tonsils and distal ileum of all cattle.
However, the government of Japan defines SRMs as: (1) the brain, skull,
eyes, trigeminal ganglia, spinal cord, vertebral column, dorsal root
ganglia (DRG), the tonsils and distal ileum of all cattle.
Although Americans eat SRMs of cattle younger than 30 months, Japanese
people never eat them.
The US has already agreed with the Japanese government that they accept the
Japanese definition of SRMs, and the US promises not to export SRMs (as
defined by Japan) to Japan.
