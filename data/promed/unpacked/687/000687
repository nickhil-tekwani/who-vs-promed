The borough has become an area of national intervention for COVID-19, with 100 new cases since Friday [12 Sep 2020] and the infection rate now "3 or 4 times higher" than it was a few weeks ago.

And in the latest health crisis Public Health England (PHE) Midlands, the Health and Safety Executive and Sandwell Council are jointly investigating 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of Legionnaire's [disease] and 6 suspected cases in West Bromwich.

No direct link between the cases has been found, although they are believed to have originated from a "common source".

Eight of the cases were reported to PHE in the last week and a single case reported in July [2020] has subsequently been linked to the outbreak. 6 of the patients are receiving treatment in hospital.

Dr Adrian Philips, consultant in communicable disease control at PHE Midlands Health Protection Team, said: "While we do not currently have a direct link between these cases, the evidence we have points to the possibility that there is a common source. We are taking detailed histories of the movements of the individuals to see if there are similar patterns which would help to identify a common local source of infection. Legionnaires' disease is a rare but potentially life-threatening illness.

It is caused by a bacterium commonly associated with water systems and cannot be passed from person to person. As a precaution, we are working with the Health and Safety Executive and Sandwell Council to identify and control any possible sources of the disease."

A Sandwell Council spokesman said: "The council is working closely with PHE and the Health and Safety Executive to find the source of this outbreak and we will continue to do everything we can to support the investigation."

The early symptoms of legionnaires' disease include 'flu-like' illness with muscle aches, tiredness, headaches, dry cough, and fever which can then lead to pneumonia.

Action to date includes identifying, sampling, and advising on the disinfection of potential sources of the bacteria, such as cooling towers in areas around West Bromwich that the cases may have each visited. Health care staff, including GPs, have been alerted to look out for others with similar symptoms. People are advised if they are feeling unwell with any similar unexplained symptoms to legionnaire's disease to contact their GP, ring NHS 111 or visit http://www.nhs.uk

[Legionellosis is caused by various species of _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_. _Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Amebae harbor _Legionella_ intracellularly and the long-term persistence of _Legionella_ within various water systems is favored by their intracellular location, which provides protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment. The formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems that is usually done by culture would miss VBNC [viable but nonculturable] _Legionella_. VBNC _Legionella_ can be revived by addition of amebae (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Legionnaires' disease (LD) is the acute pneumonic form of the disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis with fever, malaise, and muscle aches that is less severe than LD; symptoms of Pontiac fever resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html). Risk factors for LD include age greater than or equal to 50 years, smoking (current or historical); chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD); immune system disorders due to disease or medication; systemic malignancy; and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html). LD takes its name from an outbreak among people attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in 1976.

Both LD and presumably Pontiac fever are acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. People who are prone to aspiration can also develop LD following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). Aerosolization of the contaminated warm water can occur in showers, spa pools, sprays in groceries, water fountains, and cooling towers. Why some persons exposed to contaminated aerosols develop LD and others develop Pontiac fever is unknown.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from cases of LD will help to establish whether this cluster of cases is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnoses of LD were confirmed through urine antigen testing, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. We await further information as the investigation of the cluster of cases in West Bromwich progresses.

West Bromwich, with a population of almost 78 000 in 2018, is a market town, 6.4 miles (10.3 km) northwest of Birmingham, in the borough of Sandwell, West Midlands, England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bromwich). - Mod.ML
