Even though scores of new cases of dengue fever in northern Mexico indicate
the disease is spreading, health officials in the United States say there's
little danger of the outbreak moving north into Texas.
At least 5,500 people have been diagnosed with the painful, mosquito-borne
disease this month alone in Mexico's Nuevo Leon state. Of those, about 150
had the sometimes-fatal form known as hemorrhagic dengue [dengue
hemorrhagic fever = DHF - Mod.CHC. Another 500 cases have been reported
in the neighboring state of Tamaulipas, which runs along the border from
Nuevo Laredo to the Gulf of Mexico. Five people have died in Nuevo Leon and
two in Tamaulipas.
On Friday, the government news agency Notimex quoted health officials in
northern Coahuila state as saying they had confirmed 77 cases there,
including one case of hemorrhagic dengue. Coahuila's assistant director of
health services, Marco Antonio Ruiz, was quoted as saying that another 461
cases are being analyzed.
Texas has recorded 22 dengue cases since July 1. Five were acquired locally
and 17 were picked up traveling, according to Texas Health Department
spokesman Doug McBride. But he said there is little danger of a major
outbreak crossing the border. "The mosquitoes that carry the virus don't
travel more than a few hundred feet from where they were hatched, and we
have cooler weather coming that's slowing mosquitoes down," he said.
Officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta
referred all questions about the dengue cases to state health authorities,
saying they haven't been studying the outbreak.

[If the report is correct, and CDC has not been involved in dengue studies
in Texas, I suppose it is because they have been too busy with West Nile
virus studies. It certainly is not for lack of interest. Perhaps the US
Government could ask the Cuban Government (through the Swiss Ambassador, of
course) whether they could spare a couple of mosquito control/dengue
experts to help us in the border states. - Mod.CHC
