A northern Alberta farmer was this year's first [Canadian] victim of the
rare but deadly [Sin Nombre?] virus, which may be found in the droppings of deer
mice.
The farmer, from somewhere east and north of Edmonton, died after coming
into contact with mice droppings and contracting the disease, said Dr. Karen
Grimsrud, Alberta's deputy provincial medical officer.
The man was Alberta's 20th hantavirus victim since 1989. Six have died,
including three of the four victims infected last year.
All but one -- a person from Okotoks southwest of Calgary -- were from
north-central Alberta.
Detailed information on the disease and precautions to take is available on
the Internet at

[The statement that the farmer acquired his infection from droppings of
infected mice likely is speculative, although probably correct. Additional
information can be found at the Centers for Disease Control web site:
