The woman was only 26, with no past medical problems, no allergies and no family history of asthma. Yet a day after being admitted to a western Canadian hospital with a dry cough and difficulty breathing, she was dead.

The culprit: [a] hantavirus, a virulent pathogen inhaled as the young mother of 2 cleaned up a garage littered with deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] droppings.

New evidence suggests the risk of such tragedies, though still rare, is mounting. Federal scientists have documented a sharp surge in human cases of the nasty virus [infection], transmitted via the commonplace rodent's excrement -- and has a 30 per cent death rate, a newly published study reveals.

The number of infections reported in 2013 and 2014 were twice the yearly average of the last 20 years, possibly due to mild winters that helped boost mouse populations, Public Health Agency of Canada researchers say.

Outside experts say Canadians don't need to panic, but argue the infection's heavy mortality rate and lack of treatment calls for caution by residents of the most-affected area -- the Western provinces.

"The deer mouse is distributed everywhere in Saskatchewan [province] and it seems to be a crap shoot whether you get it or don't get it," said Denise Werner, that province's Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health. "So everybody has to take care when going into mouse-infested areas."

Saskatchewan has itself had 30 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] -- the disease caused by inhaling the virus -- since 1994, with 10 of those people dying.

The so-called "Sin Nombre" -- Spanish for nameless -- version of the infection was 1st discovered in the 1990s, and since then Canada has experienced 4 or 5 cases a year.

That number jumped to 13 in 2013 and 10 last year, with close to a 3rd of patients succumbing to the illness.

People often contract it when cleaning up buildings dirtied with deer mouse droppings, which can be inhaled. The 26-year-old woman, whose case was described in the agency paper, had started feeling "unwell," then a week later entered hospital suffering from respiratory distress.

About 2 weeks earlier, she had been vacuuming out an old garage full of mouse droppings. Experts advise airing out cabins and barns before cleaning them, using wet rags instead of brooms to keep particles down, and applying bleach solutions to suspect areas.

The increase in hantavirus [infection] cases is definitely a concern, but the spread of such infections is often difficult to predict, said Muhammad Morshed, head of zoonotic and emerging pathogens for the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control.

[This report does not mention if Sin Nombre virus was laboratory confirmed in this case, but this virus is most likely the one responsible for this HPS case. This report is another reminder that cleaning in closed buildings that have been little used or unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.

A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site with extensive information about hantaviruses, including those in North America, with clinical signs, treatment, epidemiology, and an image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America and occurs in Saskatchewan. A map showing its distribution can be accessed at http://www.discoverlife.org/nh/tx/Vertebrata/Mammalia/Muridae/Peromyscus/maniculatus/images/Peromyscus_maniculatus_map.mx.jpg. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at the source URL above.
