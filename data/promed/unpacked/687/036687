[1] Cholera - South Sudan

100 people have died in the South Sudan cholera outbreak, according to the UN's Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). In its weekly situation report, OCHA said there have been 4418 total cholera cases since May 2014, mainly in Juba, Eastern Equatoria, and Upper Nile [states], with a fatality rate of 2.3 percent, [which is] above the emergency threshold.

The biggest increase of cholera is in Wau Shilluk, a village in Upper Nile downstream from Malakal, where there have been 793 confirmed cases. To deal with the outbreak in Wau Shilluk, OCHA said that clean water access is being ramped up and volunteers are providing the population with cholera prevention and awareness messages. Aid agencies are also providing soap and hand washing stations.

New cholera cases are under investigation in Malakal and Bol, Upper Nile, as well as Kapoeta North, Eastern Equatoria. In Bentiu, Unity State, where there have been suspected but unconfirmed cases, a new site has been prepared for a cholera treatment center.

Rains are severely hampering delivery of aid to affected populations, with 90 percent of main roads in Jonglei impassable and 75 percent impassable in Unity State. Insecurity has also slowed distribution of aid, including food. A food distribution to 37 000 people in Nhialdiu, Unity state, was disrupted on Tuesday, 15 Jul 2014, by clashes between pro- and anti-government forces.

[2] Cholera - South Sudan (Upper Nile)

Health workers in Fashoda County in South Sudan's Upper Nile State said there have been about 18 cases of cholera with 5 deaths in the last 2 weeks [about 4-18 Jul 2014]. The infected citizens are currently getting medical attention at cholera treatment centers established by Doctors Without Borders [MSF] and South Sudan Society of Red Cross [SSRCS] at Lol and Poul villages.

Dr. Olau Alou, the Fashoda County Medical Services Director, told Radio Tamazuj on Wednesday [16 Jul 2014] that the 5 fatalities and the 18 confirmed cholera cases were from Lol and Poul areas. The official also expressed concern about the spread of the outbreak to the neighboring areas in Upper Nile. He attributed the problem to the movements of infected people to areas where there are no health facilities, which makes it difficult to contain the outbreak.

Alou noted the 13 [remaining] patients are now receiving treatment at therapeutic centers, saying the county headquarters have not recorded any cholera cases so far. "The MSF and SSRCS [South Sudan Red Cross Society] have opened about 3 cholera treatment centers in Lol, Kodok and Poul areas," he explained.

Last week [week ending 13 Jul 2014], a medical assistant in Kodok Payam Hospital told Radio Tamazuj that 4 people died of cholera and about 100 cholera cases were recorded in the Lol area alone.

[There are 10 states in the nation of South Sudan, as can be seen on this map: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_South_Sudan.

Up to this point, many of the cases have been in the eastern part of the country, both in the south (Eastern Equatoria State) and north (Upper Nile State) but with a few cases in the central eastern state, Jonglei. - Mod.LL
