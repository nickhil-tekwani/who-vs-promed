[MERS-CoV transmission in Saudi Arabia continues with 9 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Among these 9 newly confirmed cases is 1 primary case with a history of camel contact in Najran, 1 secondary case in a household contact in Riyadh city, and 7 cases in Wadi Aldawasir; 3 of whom are classified as primary cases (2 with a history of contact with camels), 2 are classified as secondary healthcare acquired cases and 2 are still under investigation, both with no history of contact with camels.

The 9 reported cases involve 5 females and 4 males. Of the 9 newly confirmed cases, 5 are reported to be under home isolation and 4 are hospitalized. I usually interpret the home isolation cases to be asymptomatic infections, but 1 of the cases on home isolation is listed as a primary case with a history of contact with camels, raising questions as to the criteria for home isolation, and the criteria used for testing. Is testing now being expanded to mildly symptomatic individuals known to have had recent contact with camels? If the answer is yes, we may well learn more re: transmission of the MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia, and perhaps learn more about duration of antibody presence in mildly symptomatic infections.

There were 2 outcome reports in today's update -- 1 fatality and 1 recovery -- in previously reported cases.

In addition, a review of previously reported cases, there were 2 changes listed in what I am referring to as transmission classification - both were cases previously reported from Wadi Aldawasire. One had initially been classified as secondary case in a household contact that was reclassified as a secondary healthcare acquired case, the other was originally classified as a secondary healthcare associated case that was reclassified as a primary community acquired case.

With the addition of these 9 newly confirmed cases, there have been a total of 60 cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since 1 Jan 2019 with 45 of these cases reported since 1 Feb 2019. Since 29 Jan 2019 there have been 36 cases reported from Wadi Aldawasir in Riyadh region. While the overwhelming majority of cases reported since the beginning of the year (2019) were from Riyadh province, there were 8 cases reported from other provinces - Makkah (2 cases), Al Qaṣīm (3 cases), `Asīr (1 case), Al Jawf (1 case) and Najran (1 case), representing a wider geographic spread of transmission of the disease.
