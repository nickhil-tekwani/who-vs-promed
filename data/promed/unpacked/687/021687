A baby died in a hospital in Guadalajara [Jalisco], after a surgery at the IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] Regional Hospital no. 1 in Culiacan [Sinaloa], which was complicated by an infection with _Klebsiella_ bacteria.

The child's mother said the baby died on Saturday night [26 Sep 2015]. Four days earlier she had been told that the baby had a complicated history of infections from birth, which was stated in a report attached to the baby's medical records, but she said that the family hadn't been notified. "I was told here [in Guadalajara] that the [baby] girl had that problem [complicated history of infections from birth?], and that was the reason there had been complications. But I wasn't informed at the hospital in Culiacan or here; I had no idea and would never had imagined it," she said over the telephone. "This was 4 or 5 days before she died [on 26 Sep 2015]," she said.

IMSS authorities in Sinaloa reported that 16 newborns had been relocated from the neonatal unit after the deaths of 11 babies due to a possible bacterial infection; days later another newborn died and then another girl died on [Fri 25 Sep 2015] in Guadalajara.

The mother said the baby had been born prematurely on 18 Jul 2015 at the Culiacan Regional Hospital, and that days later she presented discomfort with mucus in her lungs, which was dismissed by physicians at that institution. On [17 Sep 2015], the girl was taken to Guadalajara for surgery of the retina, recommended by the Specialized Medicine department of the IMSS in Culiacan, but the surgery was complicated by an infection that might have been acquired at the regional hospital in Culiacan.

"When the girl got sick after surgery, a friend in Culiacan investigated and found a sheet of paper in her records that said she had a severe case of infection with the bacteria. The director told me it was dangerous," she said, and that "had they known, they would have treated the bacterial infection, but it was too late, and she was already very sick," she said. The family demanded an explanation from the IMSS Culiacan, as have done the families of the other 12 deceased babies.

The IMSS Sinaloa is investigating the death of the newborn in Guadalajara since she presented the same clinical picture as the other affected babies. According to hospital staff, the reason for the investigation is that the baby, who was born at the Culiacan Regional Hospital, presented the same symptoms as another 8 newborns who are in hospital, one of them in serious condition and with low probability of survival.

[_Klebsiella_ species, particularly _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Klebsiella oxytoca_, are frequent nosocomial pathogens, especially among premature infants in neonatal intensive care units, causing pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicemia, surgical wound sites, meningitis, and bacterial endophthalmitis (1-4). The presence of invasive devices such as IV catheters, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, and use of antibiotics are factors that increase the likelihood of nosocomial infection with _Klebsiella_ species. The primary pathogenic reservoirs for transmission are the gastrointestinal tract and the hands of hospital personnel. Klebsiella can spread rapidly, often leading to clonal nosocomial outbreaks, which may be caused by multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella_ spp, especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) or _K. pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC) producers in neonatal wards. Often breaks in infection control practices are found to have facilitated nosocomial outbreaks.
