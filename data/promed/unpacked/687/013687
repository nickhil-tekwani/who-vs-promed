Some 3000 Babenga Threatened By Bush Yaws
-----------------------------------------
At least 3000 inhabitants of the Department of Likouala, in the northern
Republic of Congo, are seriously threatened by bush yaws, a contagious
tropical disease, UNICEF programs administrator in the country, Liliane
Tumbe, said on Fri 9 Apr 2004.
"We have been able to treat 135 pygmies -- 41 of them children -- during
our recent visit to the area," she said in Brazzaville, the nation's
capital. However, she said many of the area's inhabitants, known as the
Babenga, could not be treated because they had left their encampments to go
fishing.
Yaws is an infectious tropical disease resembling syphilis in its early
stages and is marked by red skin eruptions and ulcerating lesions in places
such as the nose, mouth and ears. There are several varieties of this
disease, variously known as framboesia, pian, verrugas, and crab yaws. The
disease is commonplace among the 6000 Babenga, sometimes know as pygmies,
in Likouala.
"Fortunately, it is not difficult to treat this disease. A simple injection
of the antibiotic extenciline [benzathine penicillin - Mod.LL] will kill
the germ," Tumba said.

[Yaws, also known as parangi, paru, buba, bouba, and endemic treponematosis
-- besides those names in the posting -- is a non-venereal contagious
infection caused by _Treponema pertenue_, a variant of _T. pallidum_, the
cause of syphilis. It transmits primarily in young children in the warm
and humid tropical areas of Africa, Asia, and Oceania due to skin-to-skin
contact.
The natural history of yaws can be classified in 4 stages like its close
relative syphilis. A primary stage with the mother yaw (a papillomatous
lesion at the inoculation site), the secondary stage with widespread
cutaneous lesions similar to the primary lesion, a latent phase usually
with no symptoms, and a tertiary stage (in about 10 percent) with
destructive lesions of bone, joint, and soft tissues. Cardiovascular or
neurological manifestations as seen in syphilis are not characteristic of
yaws.
Although the diagnosis is almost always clinical in nature, the serological
tests for syphilis are also reactive in yaws. - Mod.LL]
