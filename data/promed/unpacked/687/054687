Subject: 2bposted - Rift valley fever - Mauritania: RFI

We have received information from a usually reliable source that there has
been an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in Mauritania with both human and
livestock losses. Unfortunately, we have lacked independent confirmation
and further information or details. If any member can provide same, would
they please?
