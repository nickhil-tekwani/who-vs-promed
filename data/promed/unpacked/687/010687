The number of villagers affected by arsenic-contaminated water in
Hechi city, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has increased to
200, according to statistics released by the local government on
Wednesday [8 Oct 2008] afternoon.

Nineteen victims, including children and an elderly man, were in
hospital under observation. "All of the 19 severely poisoned are in
stable condition, while all the affected are in good health so far,"
Huang Jiale, director of Guangxi regional occupational disease
prevention and control institute, said.

Huang was among the 20 medical experts sent by the provincial
government from the local poison and disease and prevention center
and Guangxi regional occupational disease prevention and control institute.

Residents of 2 villages in Hechi began to suffer symptoms, such as
facial swelling, vomiting, and blurred vision, on Friday [3 Oct 2008].

"Only a small number of the villagers affected show excessive amounts
of arsenic in their urine samples, which usually can be cleansed in 9
to 15 days in general," Huang said.

The local government carried out urine tests on all 640 residents,
but results are yet to be published, the Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday [9 Oct 2008].

Environmental monitoring measures indicated the villages' water
source was polluted by industrial waste from a nearby metallurgy
enterprise, which has since been closed.

Authorities said torrential rain during Typhoon Hagupit on 25 Sep
2008 caused an overflow of wastewater that polluted nearby ponds and
wells. They have been sealed off indefinitely. The local fire brigade
has sent safe water to the affected villages at noon and 5 pm every
day since 3 Oct 2008.

According to industry sources, Hechi stopped operation of all
smelting plants on Wednesday [8 Oct 2008] for the next 2 months for inspection.

Hechi is one of Guangxi's most important mineral producers with an
annual smelting capacity of 700 000 tons of nonferrous metal.

About 450 people have fallen ill in southern China after drinking
contaminated water, the Xinhua state news agency says. Four of the
sick, in 2 villages in Guangxi province, have arsenic poisoning.
Industrial waste from a metal company has been blamed.

Residents began to show symptoms of facial swelling, vomiting, and
blurred vision on 3 Oct. 2008.

Last month [September 2008], tainted milk left more than 50 000 children sick.

Ge Xianmin, head of the Guangxi regional occupational disease
prevention and control institute, told Xinhua: "The villagers were
slightly poisoned. They can be cured in 9 to 15 days with timely treatment."

Health officials said 23 children under the age of 7 and 32 people
aged over 60 had been kept in hospital for observation, while others
were receiving outpatient treatment.

According to local government officials, torrential rain caused
wastewater containing arsenic from the Jinhai Metallurgy Chemical
Company to overflow and pollute nearby ponds and wells.

The company -- a branch of the state-owned Liuzhou China Tin Company
-- was closed after the contamination was discovered. Xinhua said the
local government and the company had agreed to share the medical
costs of the villagers.

Last month [September 2008], 4 children died and more than 50 000
were sickened after they were fed on baby milk powder contaminated
with the industrial chemical melamine. The scandal resulted in a
recall of many Chinese milk products.

[Arsenic is a semi-metal element in the periodic table. It is
odorless and tasteless. It enters drinking water supplies from
natural deposits in the earth or from agricultural and industrial
practices. Arsenic is a naturally occurring element widely
distributed in the earth's crust. In the environment, arsenic is
combined with oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur to form inorganic arsenic
compounds. Arsenic in animals and plants combines with carbon and
hydrogen to form organic arsenic compounds.

Inorganic arsenic compounds are mainly used to preserve wood. Copper
chromated arsenate (CCA) is used to make "pressure-treated" lumber.
CCA is no longer used in the US for residential uses; it is still
used in industrial applications. Organic arsenic compounds are used
as pesticides, primarily on cotton fields and orchards.

Non-cancer effects can include thickening and discoloration of the
skin, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting; diarrhea; numbness in hands and
feet; partial paralysis; and blindness. Arsenic has been linked to
cancer of the bladder, lungs, skin, kidney, nasal passages, liver,
and prostate.

The arsenic standard for drinking water is set at .010 parts per
million (10 parts per billion) to protect consumers served by public
water systems from the effects of long-term, chronic exposure to arsenic.

Almost nothing is known regarding health effects of organic arsenic
compounds in humans. Studies in animals show that some simple organic
arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic forms. Ingestion of
methyl and dimethyl compounds can cause diarrhea and damage to the kidneys.
