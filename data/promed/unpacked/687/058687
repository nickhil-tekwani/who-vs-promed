Despite [perhaps because of? - Mod.JW] a national campaign, lapses in
food safety are continuing [to unfold]; 3 more [now 4, see below]
Chinese brands of chicken's eggs have been found to contain high
levels of the chemical melamine. Tests in Hong Kong first revealed
dangerously high levels of the substance in eggs from a mainland
supplier earlier this week [starting 26 Oct 2008]. [Mainland]
officials were reportedly aware of the contamination a month earlier
[September 2008].

Like the milk scandal before it, the contamination of China's egg
supply appears to be far more widespread than first realized. And as
before, it seems that local officials on the mainland attempted to
cover up news of the contamination, says the BBC's Quentin
Sommerville in Beijing.

A newspaper in Beijing reports that the sanitation department of
Liaoning province, in the northeast, began investigating a local egg
producer at the beginning of October [2008]. It then ordered a ban on
any media interviews.

Local officials say melamine was illegally mixed into chicken feed to
make eggs [test] richer in protein than they were, but central
authorities have not commented.

Despite a nationwide campaign to raise food safety standards and
reassure consumers, the mainland's broken down food safety
inspectorate is still failing to catch and report lapses in standards
when they happen, our correspondent says. Hong Kong is stepping up
its tests of mainland Chinese food products and is asking China's
help to trace the source of melamine contamination in eggs. Testing
of animal feed, chicken meat and eggs will also be introduced.

Boxer Lovers Body Pen Set, described by its maker as the sensual way
to indulge a sweet tooth, joined Orion cakes and Kirin tea on the
list of products recalled in Australia because of contamination with
the chemical melamine.

Consumers who may have bought this product are advised not to consume
this body paint, which should be disposed of safely, Australia's food
safety regulator said in a statement.
