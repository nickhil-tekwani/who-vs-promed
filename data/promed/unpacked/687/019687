[The outbreak in Beijing continues with 7 newly confirmed cases attributed to the outbreak. The 1st case in Beijing was reported on 11 Jun 2020; as of 27 Jun 2020, there have been 318 cases reported from Beijing, 21 in Hebei, and 3 in Liaoning, most likely associated with this outbreak.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and 1 new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, there have been 25 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infections reported by China. More in-depth follow-up information on the ongoing outbreak in Beijing can be found in section [1] of COVID-19 update (262): China (Beijing) superspreaders, WHO, global 20200616.7473860.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with the SARS-CoV-2; many of whom are detected as asymptomatic at the time of positive PCR testing. The most likely scenario for the outbreak in Beijing was an asymptomatic infected individual had false negative PCR testing, and started a transmission chain that ultimately reached the implicated market which served as an amplifier via a superspreading event(s). A similar scenario that may well have occurred in Wuhan with the seafood market serving as an amplifier of the prior "silent" transmission of infection.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 42 cases with no new deaths, compared with 62 cases and no new deaths in the previous day (27 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 78 consecutive days. There were 30 locally transmitted cases: Gyeonggi (14), Seoul (6), Gwangju (3), Daegu (2), Daejeon (2), Busan (1), Incheon (1), and Jeonbuk (1), and 12 imported cases -- airport quarantine (5), Gyeonggi (2), Seoul (1), Gwangju (1), Jeonnam (1), Gyeongbuk (1) and Gyeongnam (1). There were 6 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases.

According to data from the "ncov" website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the cumulative rate has been 9.4% (http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs.

Tabular and graphic analyses of the situation in South Korea with the addition of the 62 newly confirmed cases are available at the English language page, notice 401 and 401 are analyses of the 61 cases confirmed yesterday (27 Jun 2020) including listings of current ongoing clusters. Three of the clusters are related to religious gatherings, 2 clusters are related to door-to-door sales, 2 are related to "gatherings, and 1 to a club meeting.

Importations came from https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030. Americas (3), Europe (1), Asia excluding China (18), Saudi Arabia (4), Turkey (3), Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kyrgyzstan (2 each), Kuwait, India, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Malaysia (1 each).

Takeaway message: Importations continue to be a challenge, and gatherings whether social or religious are key foci for enlarging clusters.

[These figures come from the table published for the day, recognizing there have been adjustments in some of the data from previous tables - Mod.MPP]:

- 240 310 cumulative cases, increase of +174 from 27 Jun 2020;
- 16 681 people are currently positive for the virus (-155);
- 188 891 people have recovered (+307) since 27 Jun 2020;
- 1160 patients are hospitalized with symptoms (-100), 98 in intensive care (+1), and 15 423 (-56) are in home isolation;
- 34 738 deaths have been reported, (+22) deaths since 27 Jun 2020;

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +174 cases and +22 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (27 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +175 cases and +8 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (97). Emilia-Romagna (21), Piedmont and Lazio (14) each, and Veneto (11), are the 5 provinces reporting more than 10 newly confirmed cases. A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 54 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 38 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Takeaway message: Northern Italy still warrants close monitoring, the virus is still present and too much lifting of measures may lead to recrudescence of increased transmission.

[4] Iran: 222 669 total cases, 10 508 deaths
Date: Sun 28 Jun 2020
Source: Bourse and Bazaar, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
https://www.bourseandbazaar.com/news-1/2020/6/28/virus-hit-iran-says-masks-compulsory-from-next-week


Iran said Sunday [28 Jun 2020] it will make mask-wearing mandatory in certain areas and has allowed virus-hit provinces to reimpose restrictions, as novel coronavirus deaths mounted in the Middle East's worst-hit country. The new steps were announced as Iran counted 144 new fatalities from the COVID-19 disease, its highest death toll for a single day in almost 3 months. The Islamic republic has refrained from enforcing full lockdowns to stop the pandemic's spread, and the use of masks and protective equipment has been optional in most areas.

President Hassan Rouhani said Iran would have to live with the virus for the "long haul", as he announced the latest measures to combat it. Mask-wearing would be "obligatory in covered spaces where there are gatherings", he said during a televised meeting of the country's anti-virus taskforce. According to him, the measure would come into force as of next week, continue until [22 Jul 2020] and would be extended if necessary.

Rouhani said the health ministry had devised "a clear list" of the types of spaces and gatherings deemed high-risk, but he did not elaborate. He also did not say what the penalty would be for those who fail to observe the measure. According to deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi, services would not be provided to those without masks in areas such as government organizations and shopping malls.

But implementing the measure may be difficult, as according to Tehran's mayor, many do not wear masks in places like the capital's public transport network, where it is already mandatory. "50% of metro passengers wear masks... and even fewer in buses," Mayor Pirouz Hanachi was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency. "We can't forcefully confront people without masks," he added.

'Red' counties
------------
The health ministry on Sunday [28 Jun 2020] announced 144 virus deaths in the past 24 hours, its highest for a single day since [5 Apr 2020], raising the total to 10 508. Spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari also raised total confirmed infections to 222 669, with 2489 new cases during the same period.

Official figures have shown an upward trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May [2020], when Iran hit a near 2-month low in daily recorded infections. "Considering the rising numbers, I plead with you to definitely use masks outside and in covered places," Lari said.

Iran closed schools, cancelled public events and banned movement between its 31 provinces in March [2020], but the government progressively lifted restrictions from April [2020] to try to reopen its sanctions-hit economy. The economy is starting to suffer under the pressures of the health crisis. The country's currency, the rial, has hit new lows against the US dollar in recent days, mostly over border closures and a halt in non-oil exports, according to analysts.

The increasing virus caseload has seen some previously unscathed provinces classified as "red" -- the highest level on Iran's color-coded risk scale -- with authorities allowing them to reimpose restrictive measures if required. According to Rouhani, the measure would also be extended to provinces with "red" counties. "Any county that is red, its provincial (virus) committee can propose reimposing limitations for a week", which could be extended if needed, he said.

The government launched an "#I wear a mask" campaign on Saturday [28 Jun 2020] and pleaded with Iranians to observe guidelines aimed at curbing infections. One Iranian is infected with COVID-19 every 33 seconds and one dies from the disease every 13 minutes, Harirchi said on Saturday [28 Jun 2020]. Zanjan county in northwestern Iran has already reimposed restrictive measures for 2 weeks, its governor said in a televised interview. It followed a "certain indifference from Zanjan residents and as the number of our (virus) deaths picked up again in recent weeks," said Alireza Asgari. The limitations include closing wedding halls and a ban on funeral events held at mosques, as they can lead to large gatherings, he added.

[As of 28 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 222 669, including 10 508 deaths, an increase of 2489 cases and 144 deaths since 27 Jun 2020. No mention was made of the number of provinces currently considered to be in critical circumstances, other than "several."

Takeaway message: Premature lifting of restrictions is taking its toll in Iran as is elsewhere in the world.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 637 077, including 128 437 deaths, an increase from 2 596 537 cases and 128 152 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 211 569 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 28 Jun 2020, including 17 800 confirmed deaths and an additional 4670 probable deaths, representing an increase of 340 newly confirmed cases and 21 deaths in the past 24 hours (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. The top 8 states each reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1381 to 8530.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Texas, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona. A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.5%. Of note is that the 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 18.9% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, the percentages of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay increased from week 24 (6.5%) to week 25 (7.6%), consistent with the ongoing, as yet not under control pandemic in the country.
