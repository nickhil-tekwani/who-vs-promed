With the beginning of the monsoon season, districts in the Tarai [The Terai] have started seeing cases of kala azar (black fever; visceral leishmaniasis [VL]). After a large number of sandflies, which are the vectors of kala azar, were detected in and around Biratnagar, the Morang District Public Health Office (DPHO) has already put the city on high alert.

Meanwhile, 7 people from a squatters' settlement in the border city have already been diagnosed with kala azar, and outbreaks of this disease have also been reported in various parts of the district.

The symptoms of this disease include weight loss, weakness, cough and a fever that lasts for weeks or months. Poor domestic sanitary conditions (like the lack of waste management and the presence of open sewerage) can provide a habitat for the sandfly and intensify its breeding. Sandflies are attracted more towards crowded areas like squatters' settlements and slums, as these places provide a good source of blood-meals.

In Nepal, more than 3000 people suffer from this disease every year. The government should conduct awareness campaigns in high-risk areas immediately. People, especially those living in squatter settlements and poor neighbourhoods, must be informed about the resting areas of the sandfly and be made aware of ways to prevent its spread. And since the disease is spreading in the hilly region, people living in the hills also must be made aware of kala azar.

[708 visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases were reported in Nepal in 2010 (Alvar J, Velez ID, Bern C, et al: Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS ONE 2012; 7(5): e35671. (Supplement 65) http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671). VL has been declining over the past 10 years. The reservoir is primarily believed to be post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). - Mod.EP
