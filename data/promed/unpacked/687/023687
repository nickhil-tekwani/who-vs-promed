[1] ZOO AND PARKS CLOSED
Authorities closed Taiwan's largest zoo and all five national parks
Wednesday to combat an outbreak of hoof-and-mouth disease in pigs that is
threatening the island's pork industry.
The Taipei Zoo announced a 12-day closure to prevent visitors from spreading
the virus to its 360 hoofed animals, including buffalo, giraffe and deer.
The country's five national parks also closed their wildlife reserves just
ahead of a week-long spring holiday when many hikers typically visit them.

[2] PLEA BY DALAI LAMA
Dalai Lama in plea for pigs
The Dalai Lama yesterday expressed concern over the epidemic and pledging to
pray for the doomed pigs' souls.
"I heard that the condition was serious and ... I hope everybody can get
together and pray for their samsara [transmigration]", he told Taiwan radio.

[3] EPIDEMIC TURNS INTO NIGHTMARE
Taiwan's foot-and-mouth epidemic has bred social anxiety, with
piglet-slaughtering soldiers suffering nightmares and suspicions raised that
China planted the deadly disease.
Moving to calm public fears six days into an island-wide outbreak of the
disease, the ruling Kuomintang yesterday urged all officials to eat more
pork and to serve pork dishes at banquets. On the other hand some
restaurants have stopped serving pork and many consumers have ceased buying
a meat that is normally the favourite.
As of the 26th March nearly 400,000 pigs have died or been slaughtered in an
army-led campaign to prevent further spread of the highly contagious virus.
Officials say the death toll could reach 15 per cent of the island's 11
million pigs, or 1.6 million animals. Officials say the disease and damage
to related industries could cut this year's projected economic growth rate
from 6.2 percent to as low as 4.8 percent.
Some of the soldiers - almost all of them conscripts under 25 - became so
distraught over their duties that they suffered recurring nightmares,
forcing the Army to grant them extended leave. Similar problems have been
reported in livestock owners. The Life Conservationists Association
advocates using the most humane techniques to minimize animals suffering
before they die and has proposed various human proceedures to minimise the
stress and pain in animals being slaughtered.
Amid heated debates on how the disease spread, China has frequently been
blamed. This has been fueled by call-in radio shows and politicians. Since
the outbreak was declared on March 20, investigators have said that the
virus probably came from Hainan Island - an unwelcome side-effect of rampant
pork smuggling across the Taiwan Strait.
An emergency airlift of 1.5 million vaccine units has been ordered from
Britain. So far, the slaughter has failed to halt the spread of the disease,
officials said.
[Those of us who can remember the 1967-68 FMD epidemic in the UK will have
sympathy for the young solders involved in killing these animals. It is
traumatic even when done humanely and by those with experience & proper
training.
