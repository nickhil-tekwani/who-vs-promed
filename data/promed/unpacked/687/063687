["The epidemiology of ASF is complex and varies depending on the environment, types of pig production systems, the presence or absence of competent tick vectors, human behavior, and the presence or absence of wild pigs.

"Routes of transmission can include:
- direct contact between infected pigs, domestic or wild;
- ingestion of material contaminated with the virus (e.g., food waste, feed, or garbage);
- contact with contaminated fomites (such as clothing, footwear, or vehicles), or
- bite of biological vectors (soft ticks of the genus _Ornithodoros_), where present."

"ASF is not a risk to human health."
