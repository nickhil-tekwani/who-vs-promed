[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Plateau State)

At last 20 people have been feared killed, while 32 are currently hospitalized following a cholera outbreak in Barkin town of Barkin Ladi local government, Plateau State. A member of the community confided in Leadership that 20 people had so far lost their lives as a result of the outbreak.

The council chairman, Emmanuel Loman, in a telephone interview in Jos, the state capital, however, said only 5 people had lost their lives to the outbreak of the disease, while 32 were hospitalized and were responding to treatment. He said the council had made drugs available for the treatment of those hospitalized and had also set aside a day to sensitise the people on the need to wash fruits very well before eating them and to live in a clean environment.

Loman identified poor hygiene as one of the major causes of cholera and advised the people to keep their environment clean, wash fruits before eating, avoid staying in a congested environment, and report to the nearest hospital for appropriate action in cases of frequent stooling and vomiting in their area.

At least 16 internally displaced people (IDPs) from Abud-waaq district were reported to have been seriously suffering from diarrhea. Those people live in a concentrated IDP Camp called Dayacan in Abud-waaq, where hundreds of civilians displaced by the ongoing fighting inside south and western Somalia live.

Head of Social Affairs of Abud-waaq district Kalif Abdisamad Ali, speaking to the media, said that they have taken those 16 persons who were in a dire condition to a privately owned hospital in Abud-waq district. Mr. Kalif added that those people took contaminated water stored in tanks in the camp and then used it for drinking. He mentioned that there are fears of possibly spreading the disease to the other people in the camp.
