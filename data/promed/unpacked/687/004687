I read with much interest the papers (ProMED-mail archives 980507195805
and 980509075013) on the very important public health issues of
micronutrient deficiencies. The 2 papers mostly concentrate on iron,
iodine and vitamin A (as do several recommendations by FAO). However,
vitamin B1 (thiamin) is still a highly prevalent micronutrient
deficiency in many countries particularly in those where the staple diet
is (low thiamin) unpolished rice. Thiamin deficiency can cause severe
(beri-beri) heart disease and neurological problems, which can result in
death, even in young individuals. There are numerous publications
pointing to thiamin deficiency, including a paper we did on the
population of an Indian Ocean island with low thiamin blood levels and
high incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy [J. Epidemiol Community Health
1998; 52(4):237-242.
Because thiamin intake in an optimal diet is just sufficient (due to low
context of thiamin of most foodstuffs), it has been advocated that
fortification is an efficient approach to ensure satisfactory thiamin
intake at a population level.
Could the authors of the papers in ProMED-mail, or other experts,
comment on the potential to control thiamin deficiency by the advocated
"integration of micronutrient-rich foods in the diet as a way to solve
this problem" or policies to increase vegetable consumption. Vegetables
are very expensive in many developing countries, thus unaffordable by
large segments of the population. These advocated policies are
certainly very sound on a theoretical ground. It may, however, be
argued that rapid, practical, and cost-efficient alleviation of thiamin
deficiency in many countries where it is highly prevalent will also
necessitate the fortification of selected foods or drinks consumed by
large segments of the population.

[One of the reasons for the original posting of vegetables and
micronutrients on ProMED-plant was to begin a string of postings on
emerging plant diseases that are severely effecting vegetable crops.
Our thesis, on ProMED-plant in general, is that protecting food security
crops from all disease, including emerging plant disease, will increase
the abundance of these food crops and, thus, contribute to keeping
prices down and increasing food availability. However, we do understand
that this is a complex social and economic issue. - Mod.PKA
