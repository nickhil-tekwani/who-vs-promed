[C] Update 20 - Situation in China and Hong Kong SAR 3 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_03/en/>
WHO team arrives in Guangdong Province
------------------------------------
The WHO team of experts arrived in Guangdong Province, China today and
immediately started its work. The team was authorized to travel to the
province yesterday.
Meetings were held today with senior provincial health officials. The WHO
team also listened to reports about the SARS outbreak, and held initial
meetings with health workers at all levels. These workers, who have
first-hand knowledge of the outbreak, include epidemiologists and
clinicians treating SARS patients. Discussion focused on patterns of
transmission, clinical profiles, and the suspected causative agent.
Chinese authorities had previously reported a cumulative total of 1153
cases and 40 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 Nov 2002, when the
outbreak began, to the end of March [2003], making this province the area
most seriously affected by SARS to date.
The world's first recognized case of SARS occurred in Guangdong Province on
16 Nov 2002. Expectations are high that important clues will emerge
concerning the origins of SARS, which is thought to be caused by a new
virus in the coronavirus family. The exact identity of the virus has proved
elusive. Scientists, who confer daily in teleconferences organized by WHO,
currently speculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an
animal species or mutated into a more virulent form.
In its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan city,
where the first case of SARS was reported, and Guangzhou city. The team
will also visit health care facilities, review case records, and hold
further discussions before returning to Beijing early next week.
In Beijing, the government of China is now gearing up to fight SARS on a
priority basis. Reports in today's media referred to a State Council
executive meeting on SARS and described 3 key decisions.
A special task force, headed by Minister of Health Dr Zhang Wenkang, will
take charge of the fight against SARS. A vice secretary-general of the
State Council will coordinate actions by relevant ministries. The task
force will provide updates on SARS to WHO. A nationwide mechanism for
outbreak alert and response will be set up shortly to ensure rapid
detection and reporting of outbreaks. Dr Zhang appeared on Chinese
national TV to address SARS-related issues.
Situation in Hong Kong SAR
-----------------------
The Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR reported 26 new cases today [3
Apr 2003], compared with 23 yesterday [2 Apr 2003]. These figures represent
a significant decline from the 155 cases reported on Tuesday [1 Apr 2003]
and 60 reported on Monday [31 Mar 2003]. This trend suggests that the
extraordinary control measures undertaken by the government are working.
The Department of Health further announced that 89 SARS patients have been
discharged from hospitals.
Update on cases and countries
------------------------
As of today, a cumulative total of 2270 SARS cases and 79 deaths have been
reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 47 cases and 1
death (in Hong Kong) compared with yesterday.
With the addition of the first probable case in Brazil, SARS is now being
reported on 4 continents.
New cases were reported in Canada (4), Hong Kong (26), Taiwan, China (1),
France (2), Singapore (3), the United States of America (13), and Viet Nam
(1). Brazil reported [its] first probable case.
2 of Romania's 3 reported cases, one of the 2 cases in the Republic of
Ireland, and the single case in Spain were removed from the list when
determined to have other causes.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 3 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
------------------------
As at 1 PM 3 Apr 2003, an additional 26 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 2 healthcare

including 2 medical students.
Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses
to the new treatment protocol. 85 of them are receiving treatment in
intensive care unit.
A 56-year-old man with a history of chronic heart disease died in Princess
Margaret Hospital today, bringing to 17 the total number of deaths relating
to atypical pneumonia.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows: (number
of cases with pneumonia are presented in parentheses).
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 177 (177)
53 of the patients were discharged
Patients, family members & visitors 557 (557)
45 of the patients were discharged
Total admission 734 (734)
98 were discharged

Latest Case Counts
-----------------
Since yesterday, 5 additional probable cases of SARS have been reported in
Canada. A total of 62 individuals who meet the probable case definition of
SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia, including 6
deaths; 98 individuals who meet the definition of a suspect case of SARS
have also been reported in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.
Table 1: Cumulative Number of SARS Cases Reported in Canada: 2 Apr 2003
----------------------------------------------
Province/Territory: Probable Case(1)/ Suspect Case(1)/ Deaths(2)
British Columbia: 2/ 16/ 0
Alberta: 0/ 7/ 0
Saskatchewan: 0/ 1/ 0
Ontario: 60/ 69/ 6

Total: 62/ 98/ 6
(1) These persons may drop off the probable or suspect case list if another
cause if identified for their illness
(2) This figure is included in the number of probable cases
Preliminary Descriptive Findings
---------------------
Given the information currently available, the average age of probable
cases in Canada is 46.2 years (n=45, range 2 to 82 years), with 31 females
and 20 males. The current number of probable cases by reported symptom
onset date and type of exposure is also provided [see Figure 1- Number of
probable cases of SARS in Canada by symptom onset date and exposure type
from: 23 Feb2003 to 2 Apr 2003 on website:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030402_e.html>].
Preliminary Epidemiologic Findings
--------------------------------
Transmission: To date, all probable cases of SARS have been linked to either
travel-related exposures, or in healthcare or household settings (Figure
1 -- see website). Thus, based on the current data available, there is no
evidence to suggest disease transmission in the general community.
Clinical Manifestations: A summary of the clinical presentation of SARS
based on the first 10 cases identified in Canada has recently been
published (source: New England Journal of Medicine,
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJMoa030634v1.pdf>). Listed in order
of observed frequency are fever (10/10), nonproductive cough (10/10),
shortness of breath (8/10), malaise (7/10), diarrhea (5/10), chest pain
(3/10), headache (3/10), sore throat (3/10), myalgias (2/10), and vomitting
(1/10). Lymphopenia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, elevated
aspartate amino-transferase levels and elevated creatinine kinase levels
were also reported. The World Health Organization is currently coordinating
global efforts to better characterize the clinical manifestations of SARS.
Severity of Illness: Of all the probable cases reported to date, most
remain hospitalised for isolation purposes and only 3 are currently in
intensive care. Shown in Table 2 is the reported status of 26 probable
cases currently hospitalised. Please note that these numbers are based on
preliminary data, and will be updated accordingly as more information
becomes available.
Table 2: Reported status of currently hospitalised probable cases of SARS
in Canada: 2 Apr 2003
(n=26, excluding 6 deaths and 30 individuals whose status is currently
unknown)
Status: No.Cases/ Proportion
Improving: 5/ 19.2 percent
Stable: 18/ 69.2 percent
Deteriorating: 2/ 7.7 percent
Critical: 1/ 3.8 percent
Total no. probable cases with known status currently hospitalised: 26/ 100
percent
All 6 deaths reported to date have been associated with individuals with
underlying illness and all but one occurred in elderly patients.

[The newswires are filled with reports of suspected SARS cases in a number
of countries that do not show up on the WHO update information. One
possible explanation is that these are suspected cases and the WHO updates
are presenting probable cases (with the exception of the data released by
the USA which does include both suspected and probable cases). This
confusion and discrepancy in reported cases will most likely continue until
there is a definitive etiology, with reliable laboratory testing to allow
for confirmation of actual infection with the etiologic agent responsible
for producing the clinical picture currently referred to as SARS.
In addition, in today's newswires were multiple iterations of theories that
the etiologic agent is a virus that has jumped species from animals (as the
newswires have mentioned pigs, fowl and in one case owls). The verdict on
the etiology and the origin of the etiologic agent is not out yet, and we
have decided to refrain from posting these newswires pending solid
scientific information.
The WHO update for today highlights the additional reports in the past 24
hours. For those who have chosen to read this comment first:
"As of today, a cumulative total of 2270 SARS cases and 79 deaths have been
reported from 16 countries. This represents an increase of 47 cases and 1
death (in Hong Kong) compared with yesterday. New cases were reported in
Canada (4), Hong Kong (26), Taiwan, China (1), France (2), Singapore (3),
the United States of America (13), and Viet Nam (1). Brazil reported [its]
first probable case. 2 of Romania's 3 reported cases, one of the 2 cases in
the Republic of Ireland, and the single case in Spain were removed from the
list when determined to have other causes." - Mod.MPP]
