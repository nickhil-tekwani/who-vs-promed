The Pennsylvania departments of Health and Agriculture and the
Allegheny County Health Department are advising the public of the
possible health risks associated with products, specifically
glass-bottled milk, from Brunton Dairy in Aliquippa, Beaver County.

Since 15 Jun 2011, 5 individuals, 3 young children and 2 older adults,
developed diarrhea and other symptoms caused by bacteria called
_Yersinia enterocolitica_. All 5 people drank and became ill from
pasteurized milk in glass bottles from the same local dairy.

"Until we can complete our investigation, we are recommending, in the
interest of public health, that any glass-bottled milk from the dairy
at homes or businesses be discarded or returned to the dairy, and that
residents take precaution with other dairy products from Brunton
Dairy," said Secretary of Health Dr. Eli Avila.

The shelf life of the pasteurized milk is at least 15 days and much
longer for ice cream. This warning does not extend to other types of
food purchased from or distributed by the farm, including cheese,
which is made elsewhere. The departments are working together to
investigate gastrointestinal infections in Beaver and Allegheny
counties. Illness onsets range from 15 Jun 2011 through 17 Jul 2011.
Other persons in the same households also experienced a similar
illness, but the cause of their illness was not confirmed.

The dairy is cooperating fully with the investigation and voluntarily
stopped producing milk using its on-site pasteurization facility.
Brunton Dairy is certified by the Pennsylvania Department of
Agriculture to pasteurize milk at the farm. The dairy produces
buttermilk, regular, fat-free, reduced-fat, cream, and chocolate- and
strawberry-flavored milk, as well as ice cream. The dairy makes home
delivery to households in Western Pennsylvania and sells milk and ice
cream at retail establishments. The public may also buy products on
the farm, and the milk can be purchased for use by restaurants.

_Yersinia enterocolitica_ causes diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting and can sometimes enter the bloodstream and affect other
organs. Onset of illness usually occurs 4 to 6 days after exposure,
but can be as short as one day or as long as 2 weeks. The bacteria can
cause severe infections and the illness can mimic appendicitis and
sometimes leads to unnecessary surgery. Yersiniosis is a rarely
reported cause of foodborne illness in Pennsylvania, with an average
of 22 cases annually statewide and an average of 6 cases annually in
the southwestern region of the state, including Allegheny County. Many
hospital laboratories do not routinely look for this bacterium in
samples; therefore, infections may be missed unless proper laboratory
technique is used.

State health officials say 8 people have now been confirmed to be
sickened by drinking bacteria-tainted milk from a western Pennsylvania
dairy. Officials with the Brunton Dairy in Aliquippa have said they're
cooperating with the Pennsylvania Department of Health investigation.

Health officials updated The Associated Press on Wed 3 Aug 2011,
saying the number of people sickened so far by the _Yersinia
enterocolitica_ is now 8. The illnesses 1st began to be reported last
week.

The dairy about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh is certified to
pasteurize milk, but has temporarily stopped production.

[The 1st 3 paragraphs below are adapted from the FDA's Bad Bug Book
http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070040.htm:

Because of the degree of abdominal pain, yersiniosis has been
misdiagnosed as Crohn's disease as well as appendicitis. Diagnosis of
yersiniosis begins with isolation of the organism from the feces or
blood and sometimes at the time of appendectomy. Confirmation occurs
with the isolation, as well as biochemical and serological
identification, of _Y. enterocolitica_ from both the human host and
the ingested foodstuff. Diarrhea is reported to occur in about 80
percent of cases; abdominal pain and fever are the most reliable
symptoms. Because of the difficulties in isolating yersiniae from
feces, several countries rely on serology.
_Y. enterocolitica_ can be found in meats (pork, beef, lamb, etc.),
oysters, fish, and raw (not usually pasteurized) milk. The exact cause
of the food contamination is unknown. However, the prevalence of this
organism in the soil and water and in animals such as beavers, pigs,
and squirrels, offers ample opportunities for it to enter our food
supply. Poor sanitation and improper sterilization techniques by food
handlers, including improper storage, cannot be overlooked as
contributing to contamination.

The major "complication" is the performance of unnecessary
appendectomies, since one of the main symptoms of infections is
abdominal pain of the lower right quadrant. Yersiniosis may also be
associated with reactive arthritis, which may occur even in the
absence of obvious symptoms. The frequency of such post-enteritis
arthritic conditions is about 2-3 percent.

ProMED has periodically posted on human infections associated with the
ingestion of "raw" unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization) is a process of
heating a food, usually liquid, to a specific temperature for a
definite length of time, and then cooling it immediately.
Pasteurization, unlike sterilization, is not intended to kill all
micro-organisms in the food. Instead pasteurization aims to reduce the
number of viable pathogens so they are unlikely to cause disease
(assuming the pasteurized product is stored as indicated and consumed
before its expiration date). Although known in China and Japan, the
modern version was created by Louis Pasteur, after whom it is named,
conceived as a way of preventing wine and beer from souring.

It is not the case, however, that pasteurized milk or milk products
are never able to transmit infection. In response to a cluster of
appendectomies in an area of New York State in the fall of 1976,
investigators found that an epidemic of _Y. enterocolitica_ had
occurred and that it was associated with the drinking of school-bought
chocolate milk (1). The pasteurization technique in the dairy was
found to be satisfactory and the investigation suggested that the
organism was introduced at the dairy during mixing by hand of
chocolate syrup and pasteurized milk, a post-pasteurization
contamination. An huge outbreak of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis in the USA
occurred in 1994 when ice cream pre-mix, already pasteurized, was
transported by tanker trailers that had just carried non-pasteurized
eggs (2) and an estimated 224 000 infections occurred.

Post-pasteurization contamination of milk is thought to underly most
of these outbreaks associated with pasteurized milk, although the
mechanism of contamination may not be elucidated. Such outbreaks
include more than 16 000 culture-confirmed cases of _Salmonella_
Typhimurium in Illinois reported in 1987 (3), a multistate outbreak of
_Y. enterocolitica in 1982 (4), as well an outbreaks of listeriosis in
Massachusetts in 1983 (5). The listeriosis outbreak, however, was one
in which the investigators raised questions about the ability of
pasteurization to eradicate a large inoculum of certain organisms from
raw milk.

The persistence of small numbers of pathogenic organisms may not be
relevant since the milk is kept at refrigerator temperatures for most
organisms, but for _L. monocytogenes_ and _Y. enterocolitica_ this may
not be the case. Certain organisms like these can be referred to as
psychrotrophs, defined as bacteria that may grow at 7 degrees C [44.6
degrees F] or below, irrespective of their optimal temperature for
growth (6). These organisms, if remaining at some number after
pasteurization or inoculated after pasteurization, can then replicate
in the refrigerated milk.

Although the risk from pasteurized milk is quite small, there is some.
Some, if not most, of this risk is from post-pasteurization
contamination but not all. Be that as it may, unpasteurized milk has a
much higher risk.
