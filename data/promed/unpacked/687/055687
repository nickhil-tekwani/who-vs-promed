Kwara Commissioner for Health Alhaji Usman Rifun-Kolo disclosed that a yellow fever case has been confirmed in Agunji in Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara. According to him, the patient is a farmer from Kebbi State, resident in Agunji District.

He noted that the state Ministry of Health is already in touch with traditional leaders to brief them on the outbreak of the disease.

The commissioner added that samples have also been taken from the residence to confirm whether they had earlier taken the yellow fever immunisation that took place in 2018. "The results showed only 25 per cent of people in that community were vaccinated for yellow fever," said the commissioner.

He pointed out that the patient is responding to treatment, though not fully recovered, and that health workers will commence a vaccination exercise, while urging people to comply with the exercise.

Also speaking, Dr Abimbola Folorunso, the Executive Secretary of Kwara State Primary Health Care Development Agency, said that international health partners such as the World Health Organization are already on the ground to assess the situation and render assistance.

She lamented that the non-cooperation of communities to get vaccinated during routine immunisation is responsible for outbreaks.

[The main recent focus of yellow fever (YF) in Nigeria has been Edo state. Kwara state is some distance to the northwest, making this case geographically isolated from the Edo cases.

YF virus is endemic in Nigeria, and cases occur there sporadically. It is reassuring to learn that there is a rapid response to this case with a vaccination effort planned in the area. With only 25 percent of the population vaccinated, there is a risk of ongoing YF virus transmission among the largely susceptible population in the area.
