Reactor shutdown sparks panic
-------------------------------
A minor incident at the Balakovskaya nuclear power plant created widespread
panic in Saratov and nearby regions, with people clearing iodine off
drugstore shelves and several being rushed to the hospital with symptoms of
iodine poisoning.
Reactor No. 2 at the Balakovskaya nuclear power plant, located outside the
city of Balakov in the Saratov region, some 900 km southeast of Moscow,
shut down on Thursday [11 Nov 2004] after a pipe burst, but, there was no
radiation leak, the Federal Nuclear Power Agency said in a statement on
Friday [12 Nov 2004].
However, the incident, which was 1st reported on Friday [12 Nov 2004]
morning, sparked a panic, after Saratov radio stations reported the news,
along with advice to residents about how to protect themselves from
radiation, Gazeta.ru reported. Greenpeace activists then hit the streets in
regional cities and towns to distribute leaflets explaining how to protect
oneself from a radiation leak.
Some local residents said they saw a white cloud above the plant and did
not believe the authorities' assurances, suspecting a cover-up like the one
that followed the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant,
Russian media reported.
"I tell you that there will not be a 2nd Chernobyl. It is not those times
anymore when you hide information," Igor Maly, head of the local branch of
the Emergency Situations Ministry, said on NTV television.
Sergei Kiriyenko, President Vladimir Putin's envoy to the Volga Federal
District, made a quick visit late Friday [12 Nov 2004] to Saratov to try to
calm fears. But, rumors spread quickly throughout the day that authorities
were trying to hush up the danger and were informally advising schools to
let children go home early. Some kindergartens rushed to seal their windows.
Adding to the speculation was the unusual appearance of several generals,
and about a dozen government vehicles with black military license plates,
Kommersant reported on Saturday [13 Nov 2004]. The officials were there as
part of a regularly planned Emergency Situations Ministry exercise.
Worried Saratov residents cleared drugstore shelves of iodine, and more
expensive iodine-based medicines such as sea kale and vitamins, RIA-Novosti
and the Regnum news agency reported. Some vendors at outdoor markets
started selling iodine to panicked customers at 10 rubles [USD 0.35] a
drop, the Newsinfo.ru website said. At least 7 people checked into Saratov
hospitals with symptoms of iodine poisoning. "The whole city lost their
heads," Anna Vinogradova, head of Saratov's department of environmental
protection, told Kommersant. "All the telephone lines were busy. People
were telling each other to drink vodka, take iodine, and -- no matter what
-- not to use public drinking water."
Reports of panic also poured in from the neighboring Tambov, Penza,
Ulyanovsk, and Nizhny Novgorod regions, as well as Astrakhan and Rostov,
even though the 2 regions do not border Saratov.
The nuclear power plant's reactor was restarted early Saturday [13 Nov
2004] and was running normally, Interfax reported.
Russia has 10 nuclear power plants with a total of 30 nuclear reactors,
which are regularly shut down for repairs or due to minor accidents.

[Excessive intake (ingestion) of various forms of iodine -- including
tincture of iodine, Lugol's solution, Pima syrup, amiodarone (Cordarone),
radiographic contrast, potassium iodide (SSKI), iodinated glycerol
(organidin), and others -- produce several clinical signs.
Clinical signs include pain in the mouth and throat, a metallic taste in
the mouth, fever, thirst, shock, cessation of urine production, vomiting,
diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Additionally, there may be delirium, stupor,
and seizures.
Gastric lavage with activated charcoal therapy may be the best means of
therapy, as well as supportive care. Survival depends upon the amount
ingested and time to treatment. Death is possible, and esophageal stricture
is a possible complication. - Mod.TG]
