--------------------------------------------------------------------
I must apologise, as I did not notice that this posting was not the reporting of a new outbreak but just a closing of the books on the previous outbreak in this village in April and May 2018. The only significant difference between the 2 OIE reports was that in 2018 ( 26 May 2018 Anthrax - Myanmar (02): (SA) bovine, OIE 20180526.5821050), they listed among the 2018 control activities the "treatment of affected animals (veterinary medicine)," which was denied in the later 2019 report ("no treatment of affected animals").

Previously there was an "Epidemiological comments: contact with the infected animals at a grazing point. Veterinary officer and staff visited the infected villages (12 Apr 2018) and an epidemiology team also visited the infected township for the outbreak investigation and disease control. The farmer (owner) and colleagues did not bury the carcasses but consumed the meat of died cattle and buffaloes. Due to this, the infection spread to humans" (26 May 2018 Anthrax - Myanmar (02): (SA) bovine, OIE 20180526.5821050). This is the only reference to human cases associated with these dead cows. Later, (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Zoonoses), Myanmar reported 14 human cases, no deaths, for 2018 with no indication of whether these cases were all in Sagaing or shared with the outbreak in Mandalay (25 May 2018 Anthrax - Myanmar: (ML) bovine, human, OIE 20180525.5819426 and 23 May 2019 Anthrax - Myanmar: (ML) bovine, OIE 20190523.6483764).
