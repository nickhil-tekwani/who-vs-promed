Head veterinarian's weekly report no. 2017/32
---------------------------------------------
Bovine ephemeral fever [BEF] has affected more than 50 cows and heifers in the dairy operation of Kfar Menachem [HaDarom, southern district]. The establishment's population includes several hundred cattle). One cow had to be euthanized and one pregnant heifer is recumbent, in serious condition. There was an abrupt drop in milk production within the herd, returning to reasonable levels within round 5 days.

The BEF outbreak above in Kibutz Kfar Menachem was initially reported in Hachaklait's weekly report no. 2017/31, published Sat 5 Aug 2017. The clinical diagnosis was supported by PCR test. This herd had not been affected by BEF during previous seasons.

[Kfar Menachem is located in central south Israel, some 33 km (20.5 mi) south west of Jerusalem; see map at http://tinyurl.com/yd49sdws.

According to a previous weekly report from "Hachaklait" (Israel's Cooperative Clinical Veterinary Services), in early June 2017 the practitioner attending the dairy operation at Kibutz Neve Ur reported several clinically suspected BEF cases. Neve Ur is located in the Jordan Valley, south of the Sea of Tiberias (Sea of Galilee), close to the Jordanian border (see map at http://tinyurl.com/yc9qzwyt). The said event was confirmed by seroconversion.

BEF ("3 day sickness") is an insect-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease of cattle and water buffalo that is seen in Africa, the Middle East, Australia, and Asia. The BEF virus (BEFV) is classified as a member of the genus _Ephemerovirus_ in the family Rhabdoviridae. Signs, which occur suddenly and vary in severity, can include biphasic to polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal discharge, drooling, increased heart rate, tachypnea or dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness and lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield. Affected cattle may become recumbent and paralyzed from 8 hours to more than 1 week. Morbidity may be high, mortality rate low. BEF causes considerable economical losses in the dairy and beef cattle industries.

In Israel, the disease has been reported in previous years from dairy and beef cattle farms in various parts of the country; it is characterised by seasonal pattern related to vector activity. A countrywide BEF epizootic took place in 2014.

An evaluation of a BEF vaccine applied in Israel was reported in ref 1. BEF is not zoonotic and is not listed by the OIE.

BEF may be currently circulating in other Middle-Eastern countries, sharing the same eastern Mediterranean ecosystem.
