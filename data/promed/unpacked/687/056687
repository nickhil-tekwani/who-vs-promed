Syria cVDPV2 Outbreak Situation Report 21 - 7 Nov 2017
------------------------------------------------------
Key highlights
- Ten (10) new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week from Mayadeen and Boukamal districts, Deir Ez-Zor governorate. Isolates from some cases had been laboratory pending for some time. The most recent case (by date of onset) remains [25 Aug 2017]

- The total number of cVDPV2 cases is 63

- IPV will be offered to children 2-23 moths in areas of Damascus and Rural Damascus with large IDP populations in the upcoming Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) targeting children under 5 with bOPV. The campaign is planned for [19 Nov 2017]

- 250 000 doses of IPV have arrived in Damascus, which will ensure a continuous supply of vaccine for routine immunization activities in coming months. Syria is finalizing planning for targeted vaccination with IPV and is finalizing a request for additional IPV vaccine for additional campaign activities in Hasakah, Aleppo Damascus and Rural Damascus governorate

- The International Monitoring Board (the polio programmes highest independent review mechanism) met last week [week ending 5 Nov 2017] in London to assess progress towards global interruption of all poliovirus circulation. The IMB reviewed the quality of the Syrian outbreak response to date and will provide recommendations through its report on how Syria can strengthen its outbreak response activities in coming months.

Immunization response
---------------------
- Since the beginning of the cVDPV2 outbreak in Syria, 2 outbreak response rounds utilizing mOPV2 have been completed in both Deir Ez-Zor ([22 - 27 Jul 2017 and 22 - 28 Aug 2017]) and Raqqa ([12 - 18 Aug 2017 and 7 - 13 Oct 2017]) governorates
- In addition to focused mOPV2 campaigns, a single dose of IPV has been offered to children 2-23 months in all districts of Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa, except Tell Abyad district, Raqqa. Additional IPV immunization activities to boost the immunity of children aged between 2-23 months have been carried out in high risk areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama governorates
- 250 000 doses of IPV have arrived in Damascus which will ensure a continuous supply of vaccine for routine immunization activities in coming months. Syria is finalizing planning for targeted vaccination with IPV and is finalizing a request for additional IPV vaccine for additional campaign activities in Hasakah, Aleppo Damascus and Rural Damascus governorates
- Children in 5 areas of Damascus and 2 areas of Rural Damascus (where there are concentrated numbers of displaced persons from Deir Ez-Zor) will be targeted with IPV in the upcoming Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) planned to begin [19 Nov 2017]. Updates to field micro-plans and estimates for required teams for IPV injection in Damascus and Rural Damascus continue in preparation
- The SNIDs aim to reach more than 900 000 children under five (5) with bOPV (bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine) and 20 000 children aged 2-23 months with IPV. IPV stocks to be utilized in the campaign are available from previous rounds
- More than 2.1 million children under the age of 5-y were vaccinated with bOPV in the National Immunization Days (NIDs) that took place from [8-12 Oct 2017]
- Supplementary surveillance strategies continue to be strengthened to further improve sensitivity to detect cases across the country. In addition to ongoing contact sampling from all AFP cases, stool samples are being taken from healthy children arriving from known infected areas as well as from silent districts, (districts that have not reported an AFP cases in 2017) and active case search in displaced camps continues

Regional response
-----------------
- Outbreak response teams continue to contingency plan for potential breakthrough cases in known outbreak zones or spread of virus to new areas of the country. The plans aim to ensure that the programme is able to respond as quickly as possible if any further transmission of poliovirus is detected in Syria
- Preparations are underway for a 6 week campaign to vaccinate 122 000 children under 5-y with IPV in Lebanon. The activity aims to reach both unvaccinated Lebanese children and Syrian children in Lebanon, particularly those living in Informal Tented Settlements

Coordination and surge support
------------------------------
- WHO and UNICEF have deployed additional human resources (surge support) to both hubs (Gaziantep and Damascus) since the start of the outbreak. WHO-UNICEF joint EOCs in both hubs in collaboration with partners continue to monitor the outbreak situation, exchange information, and assist in the response

Surveillance summary
--------------------
- In 2017, Syria and all governorates but 4, are meeting both key indicators for AFP surveillance: 3* or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years of age, and 80 percent or above AFP cases with adequate specimens. Deir Ez-Zor (78 percent), Raqqa (72 percent), Rural Damascus (74 percent) and Swieda (57 percent) are missing the 80 percent target for stool adequacy. (*NB: In an
outbreak setting, the target is 3 or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children under 15 years)

- The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 151 (113 from Mayadeen, 11 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 27 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 21 AFP cases (9 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 2 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 42 AFP cases (21 from Home city, 18 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts)

- Two polio-virus type-2 isolates are currently pending genomic sequencing

[Confirmation of additional cases of cVDPV in the Mayadeen and Boukamal districts of Deir Ez-Zor governorate continues, bringing the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of cVDPV associated polio in Syria to 63. Of note is that the most recent date of onset of these cases is 25 Aug 2017, and the above report mentions there are an additional 2 poliovirus isolates that are pending genetic sequencing so one should expect at least 2 more cVDPV cases confirmed in the coming weeks (or days).

A good map showing the geographic locations of each of the cVDPV cases confirmed in this current outbreak in Syria can be found at the source URL.
