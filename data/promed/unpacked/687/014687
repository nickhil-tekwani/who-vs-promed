Tetanus has killed 22 people, and lack of food or shelter could threaten
thousands more survivors of Pakistan's massive earthquake unless there is a
huge injection of aid before winter closes in, UN officials said Thu, 27
Oct 2005.
Donors, including Pakistan's rival India, have pledged $580 million for
quake victims, but the United Nations said more resources were needed to
save between 2 million and 3 million lives.
The 8 Oct 2005 quake is believed to have killed nearly 80 000 people and
left more than 3 million homeless. The World Food Program faces huge
logistical constraints because of blocked roads and the mountainous
terrain. Many of the tens of thousands of people injured in the temblor
waited at least a week for medical treatment because clinics were
destroyed. Infected wounds have become rife.
There have been 111 tetanus cases since the quake struck, of which 22 were
fatal, said WHO spokeswoman Sacha Bootsma. But she and Pakistani health
officials described that rate as low under the circumstances.
"It's an expected situation where we have so many injured people whose
wounds become infected because they are not treated in a timely manner,"
Bootsma said. She said all hospitalized patients were receiving a
preventive serum against tetanus.

[When a natural disaster such as an earthquake, hurricane, or tsunami
occurs, survivors who suffer physical trauma are at risk for tetanus if
they are not adequately immunized. In the developing world, where the
percentage of the population who have not received even a primary sequence
of tetanus immunization -- let alone boosters every 10 years -- is higher,
this risk is more substantial.
The disease is produced by the introduction of environmental spores of the
bacillus _Clostridium tetani_ into a wound, traumatic or otherwise. The
spore germinates and in a devitalized, anaerobic environment, _C. tetani_
organisms elaborate the neurotoxin, which produces muscular spasm. The
spasm of the muscles of the jaw cause difficulty in opening the mouth,
so-called "lockjaw".
The CDC recently produced information regarding tetanus prevention in
relationship to Hurrican Katrina, some of which follows:

Key points to remember
----------------------
Patients without a clear history of at least 3 tetanus vaccinations who
have any wound other than clean and minor NEED tetanus immune globulin
(TIG) not just Td [the adult tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccine - Mod.LL].
Tetanus in the USA is most commonly reported in older persons who are less
likely to be adequately vaccinated than younger persons. In 2004, 71
percent of the 34 cases reported were among persons greater than 40 years
of age and 47 percent were among persons greater than 60 years of age.
Older women are especially susceptible; a majority of those greater than 55
years of age do not have protective levels of tetanus antibody.
Diabetics are at increased risk. Reported tetanus is about 3 times more
common in diabetics, and fatalities are about 4 times more common.
Non-acute wounds (e.g., chronic ulcers, gangrene, abscesses/cellulitis)
account for about 1 in 6 cases of reported tetanus; 1 in 12 reported cases
had no reported injury or lesion.
