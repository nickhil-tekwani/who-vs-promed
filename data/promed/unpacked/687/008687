The number of chikungunya [virus infection] patients in Orissa's
Ganjam district rose to 10; 5 patients were tested positive for
chikungunya [virus infection] in Nimina, Sodaka, Gudialli, Gada
Damodaraplli, Sinduripada villages. Chief district medical officer
(Ganjam) SK Patnaik said school students in village were engaged in a
sanitation drive and to clean the human habitats, along with other
programmes to create awareness among the people. "We have seen the
sanitation drive was very effective when the school students joined in
the drive," he said. Besides cleaning the bushes and nalahs [drainage
ditches] in the villages, the students have cleaned front and
backsides of each and every house in some of the villages. The youths
from the dengue-hit Sodaka and K Nuapalli villages also joined in the
sanitation drive.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, so sporadic cases and
outbreaks are not surprising.
