Chikungunya cases have been identified on Reunion Island since 17 Mar 2010.
Epidemiological surveillance has been enhanced in several areas based on
the geographic location of confirmed cases. This surveillance consists of:

- rapid identification of new suspected chikungunya cases for quicker
action by the service to fight vectors;
- following the dynamics of the epidemiological situation on Reunion.

As of 14 Apr 2010 the strengthened surveillance mechanism permitted the
identification of:
- 25 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] by RT-PCR;
- 7 probable cases (serological presence of [anti-chikungunya virus] IgM
[antibody]).

As the map of these cases shows, 17 confirmed and 7 probable cases are
grouped in the area of the Caillou Plateau. The confirmed isolated cases
have been in Saint-Gilles-les-Bains (3), Plaine Saint-Paul (1),
Saline-les-Baines (2), Saline-les-Hautes (1), and Salazie (1). The main
focus of transmission has been in the Saint-Paul community.
