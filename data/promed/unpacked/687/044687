Highbush blueberry plants (cultivars 'Ventura' and 'Star') in Huelva [province, Andalusia] showed red-brown canker symptoms, stem dieback, and defoliation, and 30% of the plants were nearly dead. Some of these symptoms in blueberry had been previously attributed in Huelva to _Neofusicoccum parvum_, _N. australe_, and _Pestalotiopsis clavispora_.

89 affected plants were sampled. From genome sequencing and morphological characterization [it] resulted that the causal agent was _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_. The pathogen was reisolated from all inoculated stem tissues, fulfilling Koch's postulates.

This pathogen has been previously reported to cause stem blight on blueberry in China and the United States, [but] this is the 1st report of isolates of _L. theobromae_ causing stem canker and dieback on blueberry bushes in Spain as well as in Europe.

[The fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was 1st reported in Cameroon in 1895 associated with charcoal pod rot of cocoa. Subsequently it was found to have a wide host range of more than 280 species including many crops such as citrus, grapevine, vegetable hosts, strawberry, sweet potato, and mango. Depending on the host, symptoms may include wilting, fruit rots, dieback, vascular discolouration, complete defoliation, and death of plants.

An increase in virulence has been reported on some hosts, suggesting that new strains of the fungus may be emerging in different areas. It is thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may enhance the susceptibility of some hosts. Fungicides may be helpful in disease management if applied quickly enough.

Blueberry stem canker diseases can also be caused by fungal species in several other genera, including _Phomopsis_ and _Diaporthe_ (ProMED-mail post 20141218.3042756) in addition to the pathogens mentioned above.
