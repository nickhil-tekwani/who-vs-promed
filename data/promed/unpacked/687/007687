Sheep pox has killed more than 30 sheep and infected some 400 in central
and eastern Mongolia, the General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM)
said Wednesday [3 Jan 2007].
The cases of sheep pox were found in the provinces of Tov, Gobisumber,
Hkentii and Suhkbaatar, the GAEM said [administrative map of Mongolia at
<http://www.legendtour.ru/foto/m/map02.jpg>].
These cases were the 1st outbreak of sheep pox in more than 30 years in the
east Asian country.
The 1st cases were found on 29 Dec 2006 in Suhkbaatar province, where some
sheep developing pustules and running fever were diagnosed as having sheep pox.
Martial law was enforced subsequently, and the GAEM has begun disinfecting
the affected regions. More than 40 000 sheep will be vaccinated.
Stock raising is an important sector of Mongolia's economy, with more than
1/3rd of the country's population engaged in the sector.

[Sheep and goat pox (S&GP) are contagious viral skin diseases. They may be
mild in indigenous breeds from endemic areas but are often fatal in newly
introduced animals. Infections can limit trade, export, and the development
of intensive livestock production.
The causative agents are members of the _Capripox_ genus in the family
_Poxviridae_. Most isolates cause disease mainly in sheep or mainly in
goats; some isolates can cause serious disease in both species. The
causative viruses cannot be distinguished from each other with current
techniques. Only one serotype exists.
Sheep and goat pox viruses cause disease only in these 2 species.
Infections have not been seen in wild ungulates. The disease's geographic
distribution includes central and north Africa, central Asia, the Middle
East, and parts of the Indian subcontinent. The hitherto last case of S&GP
in Mongolia was recorded in 1976; according to OIE's Handistatus
information, vaccinations have been carried out in Mongolia until 2000.
The vaccines used are live attenuated; for details, refer to chapter C
(Requirements For Vaccines And Diagnostic Biologicals) of OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, available at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00033.htm>.
