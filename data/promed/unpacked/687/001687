[1] Omicron sub-variant BA.2.75

ECDC communicable disease threats report, 10-16 Jul 2022, week 28
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 7 Jul 2022 and as of 14 Jul 2022, ECDC decided to re-classify the omicron sub-lineage BA.2.75 from variant under monitoring (VUM) to variant of interest (VOI).

BA.2.75 is a newly designated sub-lineage of BA.2, mainly circulating in India (234 sequences reported to GISAID EpiCoV as of 14 Jul 2022), but also detected in 14 other countries spanning 4 continents (51 sequences). Often incorrectly referred to in the media as 'centaurus', this variant has not yet officially received a name in the WHO SARS-CoV-2 variant nomenclature.

BA.2.75 was designated by ECDC as a variant under monitoring (VUM) on 7 Jul 2022 and subsequently escalated to variant of interest (VOI) on 14 Jul 2022. This change was made due to increasing number of detections in India and world-wide as well as the concerning mutation profile of this variant. Such a profile might potentially be associated with a change in the antigenic properties of the virus, which could ultimately lead to a new surge in COVID-19 cases. No solid scientific evidence on the transmissibility, disease severity, or immune escape of BA.2.75 is currently available. The WHO designated BA.2.75 as a variant of concern Â±lineage under monitoring (VOC-LUM).

BA.2.75 shows an increasing trend in India. This SARS-CoV-2 lineage accounted for 10% of the sequenced genomes in such country in week 25 and early data for week 26 point towards a further increase in proportions. In India the infection background is mostly BA.2, suggesting that this variant may have increased transmissibility compared to this variant. BA.4/BA.5 constitute a lower proportion of circulating variants in India. Whether BA.2.75 has a growth advantage over these 2 variants, which are currently dominant in the EU/EEA remains to be determined. The currently available data are very limited and should be interpreted carefully. WHO and ECDC are continuing to monitor the situation very closely.

Within the EU/EEA, BA.2.75 variant cases are reported to GISAID from Denmark (1), Germany (2), Luxembourg (1), and the Netherlands (1) as of 14 Jul 2022. Outside the EU/EEA, BA.2.75 variant cases were detected in Australia (2), Canada (4), Indonesia (4), Japan (3), Martinique (1), Nepal (2), New Zealand (6), Turkey (1), USA (9) and the United Kingdom (14). For the latest information on variants, please see ECDC's webpage on variants. [https://bit.ly/3zb3ffJ]

[The new omicron subvariant BA.2.75 has mutations in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein that interacts with the human cell receptors. However, of note, "It's still too early to know if this sub-variant has properties of additional immune evasion or indeed of being more clinically severe." Monitoring of emerging variants and subvariants of concern is important in predicting upcoming increase in cases, thereby serving as an important tool in response planning. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Impact on childhood vaccinations

Around 25 million children around the world missed out on routine vaccinations last year [2021] that protect against life-threatening diseases, as the knock-on effects of the pandemic continue to disrupt health care globally.

That is 2 million more children than in 2020, when COVID-19 caused lockdowns around the world, and 6 million more than pre-pandemic in 2019, according to new figures released by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

UNICEF described the drop in vaccination coverage as the largest sustained backslide in childhood vaccination in a generation, taking coverage rates back to levels not seen since the early 2000s. Many had hoped that 2021 would see some ground recovered after the 1st year of the pandemic, but the situation actually worsened, raising questions over catch-up efforts.

"I want to get across the urgency," UNICEF's senior immunisation specialist, Niklas Danielsson told Reuters. "This is a child health crisis."

The agency said that a focus on COVID-19 immunisation campaigns in 2021, as well as the economic slowdown and strain on healthcare systems, had stymied a quicker recovery for routine vaccinations. Coverage dropped in every region, the figures showed, which are estimated using data on the take-up of the 3-dose diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP3) jab and include both children who get no jabs at all and those who miss on any of the 3 doses necessary for protection. Globally, coverage fell by 5% to 81% last year [2021].

The number of "zero-dose" children, who did not receive any vaccinations, rose by 37% between 2019 and 2021, from 13 to 18 million children mostly in low and middle-income countries, the data showed.

For many diseases, more than 90% of children need to be vaccinated in order to prevent outbreaks. There have already been reports of rising cases of vaccine-preventable diseases in recent months, including a 400% rise in measles cases in Africa in 2022. [https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/africa-seeing-uptick-covid-19-cases-who-says-2022-04-28/]

"If we don't catch up on vaccinations quickly and urgently, we will inevitably witness more outbreaks," said UNICEF's Ephrem Tekle Lemango, saying Yemen and Afghanistan were among countries with large and disruptive measles outbreaks in recent months.

In 2021, 24.7 million children missed their 1st dose of measles vaccine, and a further 14.7 million did not get the essential 2nd dose, the data showed. Coverage was 81%, the lowest since 2008.

The numbers are worked out using data from national health systems in 177 countries.

[In the past 24 hours, 18 countries; Germany (123 046), the USA (110 346), Brazil (107 959), Japan (99 291), Italy (97 936), Spain (57 635), South Korea (41 273), Australia (39 386), Mexico (34 567), Taiwan (25 271), France (23 027), India (20 044), Peru (15 518), Cyprus (15 386), Paraguay (14 991), Canada (14 503), Austria (12 585), and Singapore (10 526) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3585 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (14-15 Jul 2022).

A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 29 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 3 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 7.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 23.1%. Comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 17.1% increase in daily reported cases and a 20.1% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.98 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 566.57 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.38 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
