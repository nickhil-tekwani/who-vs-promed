State health officials said an adult in Dunbarton has tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus, the 3rd case of the mosquitoborne disease reported in New Hampshire this year [2020]. The person was hospitalized with a fever and a headache but has since been discharged and is at home recovering, health officials said.

Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. According to state health officials, this is New Hampshire's 12th case of the virus since it was first reported in the Granite State in 2013. There are no vaccines to prevent JCV and treatment consists of supportive care.

"This is the 3rd detection of Jamestown Canyon virus infection in our state this year [2020], and the risk for Jamestown Canyon virus and other mosquito-transmitted viral infections will only increase until there is a mosquito-killing hard frost in the fall," said state epidemiologist Dr Benjamin Chan in a statement. "All 3 of the mosquito-transmitted infections able to be acquired in NH can cause severe neurologic illness, and it remains important for residents and visitors to protect themselves and their families by preventing mosquito bites."

The "arboviral risk level" for Dunbarton -- defined as the risk of transmission of infections to people from mosquitoes -- is now considered high. The risk for Weare will increase to moderate, while the risk level for the surrounding towns of Hooksett, Hopkinton and Goffstown will remain moderate, health officials said. The risk level for Bow will remain high.

Early symptoms of JCV include fever, muscle aches, headaches and fatigue. People infected with JCV or other mosquitoborne illnesses like West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis can develop a more serious central nervous system disease like meningitis or encephalitis, health officials said.

Anyone with questions about vector-borne illnesses can call the DPHS Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at (603) 271-4496 from 8 am to 4:30 pm Monday through Friday. More information can also be found online at <www.dhhs.nh.gov> and <www.cdc.gov>.

[This is now the 3rd Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) case in New Hampshire this year (2020).

As noted previously, JCV cases are not new in New Hampshire. They were diagnosed in New Hampshire last year (2019) and in 2013, 2015, and 2017. JCV infections are extremely rare, and, if laboratory confirmed, the 2018 case was the 1st documented death due to the virus (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA: (NH) fatal, susp 20180629.5882078).

As noted in previous ProMED posts, JCV was first isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal (northern) aedes and ochlerotatus mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
