Army Asked To Fight Mosquito Virus
----------------------------------
FREDERICK, Md: In a sealed laboratory, scrub-suited Army scientists are
probing the mysteries of mosquitoes that spread the West Nile virus,
including one that could be especially adept at transmitting the sometimes
deadly disease. Entomologist Michael Turell and his 6-person team at the
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease at Fort Detrick
[are investigating the biology of the mosquito vectors of West Nile virus.
Their subjects include _Aedes japonicus_, an Asian mosquito species
relatively new to this country. Although the main culprits [vectors so far
have been common backyard mosquitoes [belonging to the [genus _Culex_,
scientists say _Aedes japonicus_ may be more capable of carrying the virus
far from the New York City area, where all the U.S. deaths so far have
occurred.
"There is no question it [_Aedes japonicus_ is going to be a player,"
Turell said. "But is it's role going to be the 10th most important mosquito
or the second most important mosquito? That we don't know."
Where does it breed? When does it feed? What does it bite? Those are the
questions the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention want
answered. The agency asked the Army to join the West Nile virus fight
shortly after the virus appeared for the first time in the Western
Hemisphere last September. "The role that Scientists at Fort Detrick are
playing is a very important one," said Stephen Ostroff, West Nile virus
coordinator at the CDC. "The more the CDC knows about the mosquitoes that
transmit the virus, the better it can advise the public on how to reduce
the risk of infection", he said.
Scientists at Rutgers and Fordham universities also are studying links
between West Nile virus and mosquitoes.
Some mosquito species are more competent vectors than others, and Turell
has found that _Aedes japonicus_ is among the best. In laboratory tests,
_Aedes japonicus_ has been 4 to 5 times more effective than _Culex pipiens_
in transmitting West Nile virus from infected chickens to virus-free
chickens. However, that doesn't necessarily mean _Aedes japonicus_ is a
competent vector in the wild. Scientists know it breeds in old tires, which
puts it close to people, and that it feeds in the daytime. But they don't
know if it feeds in the evening, when crows are roosting, or even if it
feeds much on birds.
Nevertheless, researchers have found the West Nile virus in a few swarms
[pools of _Aedes japonicus_ mosquitoes [collected in New York's
Westchester County, where one of the West Nile virus-associated deaths
occurred in 1999. Researchers are intrigued by findings that _Aedes
japonicus_ and West Nile virus share much of the same U.S. territory. In
the past 2 years, they have found this mosquito for the first time in most
of the 7 states - Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York and Rhode Island - where infected birds have been
recovered. "That's a pretty rapid spread for a mosquito in only 2 breeding
seasons," Ostroff said. "If it continues to move at the pace it appears to
have been moving, the potential to carry the virus farther afield is a
cause for concern."
Scientists are less concerned, though, about the ability of _Aedes
japonicus_ to transmit the virus to humans - mainly because the evidence is
scanty. "This is the first time that West Nile virus and _Aedes japonicus_
have ever been in the same place at the same time," Turell said. "This
mosquito isn't found in Romania or southwestern Russia, the sites of other
recent outbreaks of West Nile virus-associated disease. And in the Far
East, where _Aedes aponicus_ is common, West Nile virus-associated fever is
rare. Ostroff said he was gratified that while the virus appears to be
spreading among wild birds and insects, there has not been a rapid increase
in human infections. Only 7 cases of human infection have been reported so
far this year - 6 in New York and one in New Jersey - with no deaths.

[Since this story was filed the number of human cases has risen to 9; 8 in
New York (7 in Staten Island and one in Brooklyn) and one in New Jersey.
