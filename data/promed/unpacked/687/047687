------------------------------
In the above post, the following comment was made by a moderator: "The leading role of migrating birds and their contacts with poultry in the creation and dissemination of new avian influenza reassortants -- including zoonotic ones -- becomes steadily clearer and recognisable."

That wild birds carry all known types of avian influenza has been long known. That migrating birds can and do carry these viruses wherever they travel, both locally and longer distance migrations, is also something known for a long time. They are, of course, an important way in which these viruses are moved around and so an important source of introduction to domestic poultry. But that they play "the leading" role is quite open to question.

Most dissemination of avian influenza viruses amongst domestic poultry is by spread between domestic poultry, mostly mediated by the actions of the people involved in their rearing. In all widespread outbreaks, whilst the initial introduction is often (but not always) from wild birds, onward spread is due to poor biosecurity.

The route by which the avian influenza viruses in wild birds enter the domestic poultry population also needs to be examined. It may be that it is from direct contact between wild birds and domestic poultry or from contact with contaminated faeces. But on at least one occasion where investigation was carried out, the most likely source of introduction was from the hunting of wild birds, which were then taken back to locations where there were domestic poultry. These birds were exposed to parts of the carcasses of the hunted wild birds, which seemed the most likely source of infection, again through a human mediated route. Hunting of wild birds for food or sale is common in many countries, and mixing with domestic poultry at both poultry keeping farms and live bird markets is common and entirely human mediated.

Nor does all reassortment take place in wild birds by any means. The 2 most alarming recent zoonotic influenza events have not been tied to wild birds, H1N1 "swine flu" (wrongly named of course) and H7N9, nor has the spread of these been found to be linked to wild birds. The H1N1 outbreak of 1917 onwards was probably an avian virus, but whether from wild birds is not known. What is probable is that it emerged from camps where large numbers of soldiers had been gathered and where many domestic animals of many species were brought for slaughter to feed these troops.

So, are wild birds a threat in terms of avian influenza? Of course they are and always have been. That much has been clear for many years, preceding H5N1. If we sample wild bird populations and do not find influenza viruses, it means we haven't sampled enough animals.

But what are we to do about avian influenza viruses in wild birds? Focusing on this is both a message of despair and an encouragement to the killing of wild birds (which might actually cause more problems than it solves). We also know that human mediated spread of these viruses is the leading method of spread locally and of most transmission events overall. So, overall, people play the leading role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses. We should also play the leading role in preventing it by adopting simple biosecurity measures.

Pressure washers and disinfectants are wonderful when properly used, but are often out of the reach of many poultry producers. But we can focus on what we can do, not on what we cannot. And we can do that by using fairly basic biosecurity measures properly and appropriately applied. Time and distance [are] very helpful biosecurity measures. Soap and water are a cheap and readily available way of limiting spread. Changing shoes and washing hands will stop much spread. Closing and cleaning markets regularly is important. Understanding that weekly markets are daily markets held in different locations on different days, but with a common mobile population, is important. Working with hunters to get them to use methods that limit contact between the dead wild birds and domestic poultry is important. There are a lot of things that we can do to limit introduction into domestic poultry and even more that we can do to stop spread within domestic poultry, which is the major risk to humans.

[The role of migratory birds in the epidemiology of avian influenza has been subject to discussions since the earlier stages of the HPAI H5N1 panzootic, becoming lively when animal and public health epidemiologists, veterinarians, environmentalists and ornithologists exchanged views. Eventually, and in the spirit of "One Health," it was accepted by all that:
a) killing of wild birds is out of consideration, and
b) "using fairly basic biosecurity measures, properly and appropriately applied" (as worded above by Naomi Honhold) is vital for the prevention and control of avian influenza.

These principles were also endorsed and advocated by all international agencies involved. The methodical application of obligatory EC biosecurity requirements, including the housing of poultry during the bird migration period, has proven their effectiveness in EU countries.

The role of migratory birds in avian influenza epidemiology was eventually summarised by the FAO in September 2016: "Retrospective outlook at H5N1 HPAI virus dynamics in the last 11 years strongly suggests that waterbirds of Central Asia can propagate newly emergent avian influenza viruses to their breeding or moulting quarters during spring migration. Once delivered to stopover or moulting locations these viruses have the potential to spread in colonially breeding non-Anatidae species (gulls, terns, cormorants, spoonbills etc.) and result in more or less detectable mortalities (depending on their respective properties)."

Based upon accumulated historical H5N1 data, and upon the prompt reporting by the Russian Federation in 2006, providing information on the subtype and clade of the virus at Lake UbsuNur, FAO epidemiologists were in state to predict the evolvement of the emerging HPAI H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 virus as follows: "Countries and places in Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Europe and West Africa -- especially those that have experienced outbreaks in 2005/06, 2009/10 and/or 2014/15 -- should be on alert over the next 6 to 12 months, as westward and southern spread of the H5N8 virus is likely. ... South Asia may also be at risk of incursion of this H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 virus, potentially arriving there with fall migration in 2016. Based on past experience, this virus could also arrive in the Republic of Korea and Japan within the next 18 months." Most, if not all, of these predictions have, in the meantime, become realized. For the full, recommended paper, see ref 1.

The expression "leading," used by undersigned in the referred commentary and argued in the above comment, may be readily be substituted by "significant" or, rather, "major," as applied in Refs. 1 and 2, as follows: "It is clear that wild birds have played a major role in introducing the virus into new areas over long distances and probably at times played a role in sustaining the transmission cycle of at least several Goose/Guangdong-lineage H5 viruses between the years. Long distance transmission associated with wild birds has been observed periodically since 2003 and occurred in several major waves; for example, from mainland Asia to Japan, and from Asia to Europe, North America and, apparently, to Africa."
