A neurological syndrome, whose cause has not been identified, has
killed 7 people in the southern region of the state of Maranhao.
Another 24 people are hospitalized with symptoms [of this same
illness] in the municipal hospital of Imperatriz (637 km from Sao
Luis [the capital of Maranhao]).
Since 26 May [2006], when a concentration of cases with paralysis of
the lower extremities without defined causes was noted, technical
personnel from the Epidemiologic Surveillance Unit of the State
Ministry of Health went to investigate the syndrome.
According to Henrique Jorge dos Santos, the Coordinator of the
Epidemiologic Surveillance Unit of Maranhao, the syndrome is not
transmitted person to person.
"We cannot say if [the syndrome] is this or that, but the impression
is that it is not transmissible [person to person]," he said.
The symptoms of the syndrome are paresthesias in the legs [loss of
sensation], difficulty walking and respiratory insufficiency, which
leads to cardiac problems and as a consequence, death.
[According to] Santos, the disease is not lethal if the symptoms are
treated early, before respiratory compromise occurs and leads to
cardiac compromise.
"The disease is not necessarily lethal. But as the [affected]
population lives in municipalities that are distant [remote], when
they are taken to the hospital, they arrive in critical condition."
said Santos. According to him, the majority of the cases are young
agricultural workers with ages between age 15 and 49.
Specimens of blood, feces, skin and hair were taken for laboratory
testing. All of the material [specimens] were sent to the Evandro
Chagas Institute in Belem [Para] but the analyses have not as yet
been completed.
The Secretary of Health from Maranhao has been alerting the
population of the region to get medical attention as soon as the
symptoms appear. On Tuesday, [20 Jun 2006], 16 people were admitted
to the hospital with symptoms of this disease.

[The description of the epidemiological and clinical picture seen
with this as yet undiagnosed neurologic syndrome can lead down
several pathways.
One initial thought is the possibility of a toxic exposure (such as
organophosphates), as the predominant population affected is
agricultural workers and the syndrome does not appear to be
transmitted person-to-person (although we do not have the
information/data that would lead to this conclusion), further
suggesting this might be due to a toxic exposure. That being said,
the absence of mention of gastrointestinal symptoms along with the
description of paresthesias is not classical for organophosphate
poisoning, the mechanism of action of which the inhibition of
acetylcholinesterase at cholinergic junctions of the nervous system,
leading to accumulation of acetylcholine, resulting in initial
excessive stimulation followed by depression of the parasympathetic
nervous system. This translates to symptoms such as excessive
salivation, lacrimation, abdominal pain, vomiting, intestinal
hypermotility and diarrhea. In the respiratory tract it leads to
bronchoconstriction and an increase in bronchial secretions. It also
leads to violent muscle contractions and weakness of voluntary
muscles (which could explain the observed lower extremity
weaknesses). Death is usually due to respiratory failure.
Another possible interpretation of the clinical picture as presented
above would be an outbreak of Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS). GBS
typically presents as an ascending paralysis (beginning in the lower
extremities but ultimately can lead to total paralysis of all
extremities and respiratory musculatures), usually seen several weeks
following an acute infectious process. Predisposing infectious
agents include those associated with various types of gastroenteritis
(such as campylobacter infection) or viral illnesses such as
influenza and enterovirus infection including infection with
poliovirus. Ninety percent of those affected usually have full
recovery after a prolonged illness that may include respiratory
failure and necessitate respiratory assistance during the acute
phases of the illness. The lack of mention of predisposing illnesses
in the above cases would also lead one to question the diagnosis of
an outbreak of GBS.
As anecdotal information, this moderator is reminded of several prior
outbreak notifications this moderator was involved in investigating
in the past that were similar to the above description in the
newswire -- the 1st goes back to the early 1980s when an outbreak of
GBS was reported in Colombia. Further investigations revealed that
this was an outbreak of poliomyelitis that was being misdiagnosed as
GBS, due to clinicians feeling that it couldn't be polio since
vaccination coverages were felt to be good in the area. Similarly in
Brazil in 1985, during a major epidemic of polio in the northeast of
the country, many cases of polio were initially diagnosed as GBS,
also due to clinicians feeling that it couldn't be due to polio since
vaccination coverages were "too high" as a result of many vaccination
campaigns.
The 3rd anecdotal information comes from a report of organophosphate
poisoning in Chancay, a community north of Lima Peru in 1991. In
that instance, the clinical presentation was profuse watery diarrhea
and severe muscular spasms/cramping. Further investigations revealed
that this outbreak was due to cholera, and was the 1st major
introduction of V. cholera 01 into the Americas region in over 100 years.
That being said, this moderator would very much appreciate more
information from knowledgeable sources on the epidemiology and
clinical presentation of the cases, as well as information on
laboratory results from specimens collected for investigation. - Mod.MPP]
[This moderator requested further commentary from our toxicology
moderator included below. - Mod.MPP]
[In the early 1930s Jamacian Ginger extract (Jake, by US slang) was
adulterated with tri-o-tolyl phosphate, also known as tri-ortho
cresyl phosphate or TOCP. This particular OP has a delayed onset, and
most often and primarily affects the lower extremities. However, it
may also affect the upper extremities and in some rare cases in the
early 1930's was thought to contribute to some respiratory cases (I
am uncertain if this was ever proven, but we see a limited amount of
this phenomenon in exposed animals). Because TOCP is not a toxin that
works immediately and does not cause the usual SLUD (salivation,
lacrimation, urination, defecation) effects, the condition it
produces has been given the name organophosphate-induced delayed
neuropathy (OPIDN). We see it in animals, and I know there are cases
in humans. So it may be that these folks came into contact with TOCP
or some similar chemical and are suffering from OPIDN.
There are also some plants whose effects are very similar to those of
TOCP, although they contain different agents. Cassava, which contains
cyanogenic glycosides, when improperly prepared and eaten for long
periods of time can cause similar symptoms, including lower limb
paresesis and paralysis as the first signs.
Intoxication by karwinol A, found in the seeds of _Karwinskia
humboldtiana_ (also known variously as coyotillo, Humboldt coyotillo,
tullidora, capulincillo, capulincillo Cimarron, capulin, palo
negrito, margarita, cacachila, china, frutillo negrito, cochila, or
margarita del cero; see
<http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/ornamentals/nativeshrubs/karwinskiahumbold.htm>)
presents a neurological picture similar to that for Guillain-Barre
syndrome or other polyradiculoneuropathies. The toxin is frequently
seen in people in Mexico. N-methly-beta-Phenyl ethyl amines amd
tyramine are the toxic agents in _Acacia berlanderi_, which also
causes a similar clinical picture and has been the cause of human
intoxication in Mexico and other South American countries. - Mod.TG]
