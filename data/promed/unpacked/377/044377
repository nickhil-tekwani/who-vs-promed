No fewer than 12 persons have died in the southern part of Niger State following the outbreak of cholera disease in the area according to a statement on Monday [9 Aug 2021] by the state health minister, Idi Illiassou Mainassara. According to the statement, health authorities in Niger believe the outbreak is an epidemic. "Most of the cases are related to an epidemic that has been raging for several months in neighboring cross-border regions where there is significant mixing of cross-border populations."

The previous outbreak of the disease in the state occurred in the same regions in 2018, Mainassara said. Niger's border with Nigeria is a hot spot for cholera outbreaks, where populations often move freely between both countries with minimal restrictions, Mainassara said.

Dahiru disclosed this at a news conference on Tuesday [10 Aug 2021] in Gombe. According to him, government has already placed 3 settlements in the state capital on red alert, namely, Shamaki, Bolari-East, and Herwagana wards of Gombe local government area (LGA).

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) had reported that the state had, within the 1st and 2nd quarters, announced an outbreak of cholera in Yalmatu Deba and Akko LGAs, with 178 persons treated and discharged, while 2 children reportedly died.

"We now have a total of 77 cases of gastroenteritis and 48 of them have been confirmed to be positive for cholera. Out of the 77 cases, we lost 4 patients from the 48 positive cholera cases. With the threshold of confirmed cases reached, I hereby declare an outbreak of cholera in Shamaki, Bolari-East and Herwagana wards of Gombe LGA," he announced. He emphasized the need for personal hygiene, noting that water collected from wells must be filtered while vegetables should be washed with vinegar or saltwater before consumption.

According to him, the ministry is working with the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources to mitigate it. Dahiru further said that government had designated a temporary treatment and rehydration centre for cholera in Gombe LGA at the Tudun-Wada Primary Healthcare Centre.

Katsina State has been hit by cholera cases in addition to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, the diarrheal illness caused by infection of the intestine with the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_ has recorded a new high, with children being the most affected.

The commissioner for health in the state, Engr Yakubu Nuhu Danja, while briefing newsmen of the development in his office on Tuesday [10 Aug 2021], said cholera, which was first noticed in Funtua LGA of the state in May 2021, has killed at least 75 out of the 1534 persons affected as of 8 Aug 2021 in 25 of the 34 LGAs in the state. He further noted that 67% of the 1534 infections constitute of children within 15 years of age while overall 53% of the reported cases were males.

"Funtua LGA had the highest number of cases with 384, followed by Sabuwa with 232, Kafur 215, Charanchi 135, Kankara 71 and Jibia with 69 cases. In terms of mortality, Funtua also leads with 18, followed by Charanchi, which has 14, Jibia 11, Kankara 5, while Rimi and Sabuwa are having 4 each," the commissioner stated.

Engr Danja identified some of the challenges militating against the cholera fight in the state, including the wide practice of open defecation in some areas and insecurity, which is hindering the medical team access to some communities in the state. He also noted that the influx of visitors to cases on admission was another challenge.

The health commissioner urged members of the public to make deliberate effort at practicing personal and environmental hygiene by ensuring regular washing of hands with soap and water, boiling of water before drinking, proper cooking and storage of food, thorough washing of vegetables and fruits before eating, and washing of hands after using the toilet as well as proper disposal of feces and refuse.

Ministry of Health and Human Services has confirmed 13 suspected cases of cholera in Adamawa State. Prof Abdullahi Isa, commissioner in charge of the ministry, said the suspected cases were recorded in Gogora community of Girei area of the state. He said the cases were confirmed after PCR testing at the NCDC [Nigeria Centre for Disease Control] laboratory in Abuja.
