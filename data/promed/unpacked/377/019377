Mystery disease breaks out near Yonki
---------------------
More than 100 people have reportedly died in a month following the outbreak
of a mystery disease in several villages near Yonki, Eastern Highlands
Province.
Kollen Upa, a community leader and chairman of the Eastern Highlands
Blockholder coffee growers' association, who hails from Omaura, one of the
villages affected, raised the alarm yesterday. In his village alone, 3
people had died "strangely" in just one day.
Villages affected by what they claimed to be malaria and typhoid were
Omaura, Onanika, Sasaura, Ikana and hamlets surrounding the Yonki dam, in
the Obura-Wonenara electorate. These villages -- from the last census --
have a total population of more than 5000 people.
Mr Upa said men, women and children in the area have been falling sick and
dying since mid-March 2004. Children mainly have been worst hit by the
outbreak.
"People are dying one after the other in the villages. It is an outbreak
situation at the moment, and we desperately need an urgent medical
assistance," Mr Upa said.
Health authorities in Kainantu confirmed receiving verbal reports of the
diseases and deaths in the area. However, the chief executive officer of
the Kainantu hospital, Thomas Koimbu said so far reports have been sketchy,
as the villages were remote.
"We will investigate, however, at this stage we are only getting verbal
reports coming from the area," Mr Koimbu said. "At this stage we have yet
to establish a firm diagnostic on whether the reported cases are of malaria
or typhoid."
Mr Koimbu said malaria was endemic in the area due to the rising water
levels of the Yonki dam.
The Eastern Highlands provincial health adviser, when contacted, said it
was news to him and was skeptical about giving further information.
Mr Upa said deaths had occurred in the area and villagers were living with
fear and anxiety. He named the 3 deaths in his village as [an adult male]
in his mid 40s, [an adult female aged] 26 and a 9-year-old boy.

the etiology of the reported deaths. More information from knowledgeable
sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
