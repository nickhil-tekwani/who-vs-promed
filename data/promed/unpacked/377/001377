A trip to Italy in June caused the largest outbreak of measles in Galicia since 1996
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Galicia last summer [2011] recorded the largest outbreak of measles in the past 15 years. The outbreak had its origin in a person who had traveled to Sicily days before. The importation of the virus resulted in the spread of measles to 6 other people in the Lugo province of Galicia.

The outbreak is the largest observed since 1996 and developed in Lugo during June and July 2011. The 1st infected individual, a 30-year-old man, was admitted to hospital on 9 Jun 2011 with high fever (above 39 degrees) and severe headache. He was discharged but readmitted 4 days later when a rash developed and measles virus infection was suspected. The patient was transferred to an isolation facility, but not before he had infected 6 other people.

The 1st [of the individuals he] infected was his wife who had accompanied him during the trip to Sicily. Two other people were present in the hospital during the period when the index case was being treated. The other 3 infected included a hospital worker (who didn't know when she was infected), a woman who coincided with the 1st 2 patients at the health facility and a neighbor of this woman.

Several factors explain the spread of a virus virtually extinct in Galicia. On the one hand, all those infected were born between 1971 and 1982 and none had been vaccinated. And on the other, measles because of its rarity was not initially considered as likely diagnosis and and barrier nursing was not in place.

The key is in the dates. As stated in the report prepared by the Galician Administration, the 1st case of the outbreak in the Lugo province was notified on 22 Jun 2011, 13 days after this 1st infected patient arrived at the health centre with the 1st symptoms of the disease, which was only after the later confirmation by the laboratory. After this notification an alert was issued to all doctors and hospitals in the Lugo province, and subsequently to the whole of Galicia. [There was discussion about a delay in the laboratory processing of the samples contributing to the overall delay from presentation to province-wide alert.]

Overall, the outbreak in Lugo has highlighted the "problems" facing rapid identification and control of measles in an area, such as Galicia where it has been years since autochthonous transmission of the virus has been interrupted.

Following successful implementation of MMWR vaccination in Spain, measles had ceased to be a concern for most parents as a consequence of the absence of measles in the community. Between January 2002 and November 2011 only 13 confirmed cases of measles, and almost all imported from abroad, had been reported in Galicia.

A report on measles in Galicia has reveals that, apart from than the Lugo outbreak, the other confirmed cases in the community in recent years came originally from Morocco, Germany and the United States. People who were in these countries contracted infection and unknowingly introduced the infection into Galicia and transmitted it to others, although the effectiveness of the health system prevented further spread of the virus through patient isolation and control.

Nevertheless, they recognize that a key challenge to eradication of measles is the very high transmissibility of the virus. Since the contagious period for measles includes the 4 days before and after the onset of skin rash, prompt diagnosis is imperative. This poses problems for the Galician health administration. It is estimated that about 94 000 Gallegos [individuals living in Galicia] under 70 years are susceptible to measles because they have not been vaccinated. The authorities now recognize that in recent years, measles is no longer a pediatric disease in Galicia as the majority of cases have been in older individuals.

Measles outbreak in Volgograd continues
-----------------------------------
There have been 7 cases in just one day of the New Year holidays The measles epidemic began in Volgograd back in December [2011]. A few dozen peope are occupying hospital beds. In a few cases the infection was quite severe. All infected individuals have been admitted to the local infectious diseases hospital. However, the holiday period is not stemming the outbreak. During the 1st few days of the new year another 10 people have fallen ill. Four of 6 patients identified yesterday [2 Jan 2012] have been hospitalized. So Vogograd residents should be alert and if symptoms of fever and severe headache are experienced, you should immediately call the emergency number of the duty officer at he Volgograd region Rospotrebnadzor [Public Health Organisation].

Measles virus infection is transmitted by airborne droplets. And if you know someone infected, contact should be avoided. These symptoms of measles consist of swelling and redness of the face, runny nose, eye irritation, lacrimation, fever and hoarse cough. Measles is accompanied by development of a rash on the face, subsequently extending over the whole body.

A natural measles virus infection confers long-term immunity. Recurrent measles infections are rare and protective vaccination provides long-term immunity. The incubation period for measles 9-12 days.

[Reporting of measles virus infection has diminished. Although the prevalence of the disease has not declined to the same extent everywhere, the necessity of maintaining high levels of vaccination is generally appreciated. Weekly updates may be discontinued according to subsequent events. - Mod.CP]]
