The Director of Veterinary Services in Zimbabwe notified the OIE on 3 April
of two confirmed outbreaks of Rift Valley fever that are estimated to have
begun in January. One outbreak was in a dairy herd (Red Danish) numbering
200 in Mashonaland East, the other in a flock of 29 Merino sheep in
Mashonaland West. Both areas have seen heavy rains in recent months.
The diagnosis was done by the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Harare,
using agar-gel immunodiffusion test. Vector control, vaccination and
quarantine of the farms have been carried out.
