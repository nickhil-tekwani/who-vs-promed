[Since early June 2014, BTV serotype 4 has reportedly been circulating throughout the southern part of Bulgaria's neighbour, Greece, namely in the Peloponnisos. On 16 Jul 2014, Greece submitted its 4th follow-up report with information on 55 new outbreaks, bringing the number of outbreaks since the start of the epizootic to a total of 126 outbreaks reported to the OIE. They are summarised as follows:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 15 541 / 521 / 86 / 0 / 0
Goats / 3086 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Cattle / 514 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0
The above details pertaining to all 126 outbreaks are included in OIE's archived report available on-line, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015613_20140716_155835.pdf.

During the recent meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), 2-3 Jul 2014, Greece has provided a presentation titled "Recent Bluetongue Emergence in Peloponnisos (Greece) (June - early July 2014)." According to the presentation, the current BTV-4 strain has caused, so far, "mild clinical signs, low morbidity and mortality," and "the vector identified until now: _C. obsoletus_." Based upon the above observations, the Greek authors concluded that: "vaccination remains an option but is not a priority for the moment." The presentation, which includes historical data on BTV in Greece, maps and graphics, is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/2014070304_bt_greece.pdf.

The appearance of the same serotype (BTV-4) now also in Bulgaria may be indicative of this virus circulating in other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean as well.

Information from other countries in the region, with special reference to the eastern neighbor of Bulgaria and Greece, namely Turkey, will be appreciated.

June to November are the traditional months of BT circulation in the region. - Mod.AS
