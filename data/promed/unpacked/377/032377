Another anthrax case confirmed in Slovenia
------------------------------------------
Slovenian veterinary services confirmed on Wednesday [22 Oct 2008]
another case of anthrax just several days after 4 cows were found to
have died of anthrax on a farm in eastern Slovenia. A bull on a farm
7 kilometers (4.4 mi) away from the original outbreak was infected
with the disease, the National Veterinary Administration said in a
statement, adding that the most likely cause of the infection is
contaminated fodder.

The vets have banned the farm in Kamna Gora, 30 kilometers (18.6 mi)
southwest of Maribor, from selling or slaughtering animals and
spreading manure on meadows, Slovenian news agency STA reported. A
disinfecting barrier has also been set up and other measures taken.

On Friday [17 Oct 2008], Slovenian veterinary services confirmed
reports of the death of 4 cows caused by anthrax at a [farm in] the
village of Zice near Slovenske Konjice in northeastern Slovenia.

The Veterinary Administration said there have been almost 80 cases of
anthrax in Slovenia in the past 50 years, the last case before the
latest outbreak recorded in 2001. The health authorities were quick
to play down people's fears about the disease, saying the disease
could be contracted by humans only when people are [exposed to]
infected meat.

While anthrax cases can and do occur year round, the epidemiologic
pattern differs. While I know of grazing outbreaks in winter, they
are frankly infrequent. The commonest "winter" causes are
contaminated fodder and feed as livestock are usually housed at this
time and grazing is sparse if they are out. Most outbreaks occur
during hot dry summer weather, which is stressful for animals and
reduces their innate resistance. As a result the necessary LD50
(median lethal dose) dose is reduced increasing the probability that,
if exposed, an animal will succumb to the infection from what
otherwise would be a marginal exposure, and thus trigger of further
cases and renew ground contamination. In the tropics outbreaks can
and do occur year round at an even incidence, as one would expect.

Hard proof of "contaminated fodder" can be tricky unless one has a
good and experienced laboratory, and are lucky in your field
fodder/feed sampling; remember that at least a week or more will have
passed between an animal eating said fodder, dying, being diagnosed,
and someone getting out to speak to the farmer. Usually this
conclusion is based on circumstantial evidence of 2 or more herds
having a common food source, and an absence of any other hypothetical
causes.
