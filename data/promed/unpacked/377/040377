A deadly virus which caused havoc in common seal populations 14 years ago
could have returned to Britain. Dead and dying seals were discovered over
the weekend in East Anglia. Vets were carrying out checks yesterday on 8
sick pups, with 2 of them having to be put down, said the RSPCA. A number of
seal deaths have also been reported on Scotland's east coast. Last week, 2
dead seals were found off Lincolnshire.
Experts fear that phocine distemper virus (PDV) could be back in British
waters for the first time in more than a decade. One expert at a Scottish
university warned there was little that could be done if the virus took
hold. In 1988, an epidemic of PDV wiped out 18 000 common seals in northern
Europe, half of the population, including 3000 off Norfolk.
The virus returned to Denmark in May [2002], in the area where the 1988
outbreak began. Since then, 2000 seals have died in Sweden and Denmark, and
the epidemic has spread to Holland, where more than 100 seal bodies have
been washed up on beaches.
Of the estimated 32 000 common seals resident in UK waters, 27 500 are in
Scottish territory and 115 000 of the estimated 120 000 Atlantic grey seals
live in Scottish waters.
An RSPCA spokeswoman said: "Over the weekend, 8 sick pups were found off
East Anglia; 2 had to be humanely killed and the others are being looked
after in a wildlife hospital. We don't know anything for certain yet. We're
carrying out tissue tests on the dead animals and blood tests on the live
ones to try to find out if the virus is present."
"We expect to get results back later this week."Although we haven't found
distemper, we are very worried. We know it's imminent and it's bound to hit
our shores. "We are worried because it's taken 12 years to get back to the
[numbers] of seals there were in 1988."
The current outbreak is following a similar course to the earlier epidemic
which, when it crossed the North Sea, was largely confined to the Moray
Firth and the Wash.
The virus attacks the seals' respiratory and immune systems, making it
impossible for them to dive for food. Many die of starvation. Experts
estimate that at best only a fifth of the seal population may be immune to
the virus. Pups and female seals are particularly susceptible to infection,
especially during the breeding season. Seals spend more time out of the
water during breeding and have increased contact with each other immediately
after it, heightening the chances of the disease spreading.
Earlier this month, Dr Albert Osterhaus, of the Seal Rehabilitation and
Research Centre in Hoofdstraat, the Netherlands, said: "The recent
reappearance of PDV in this largely susceptible Northern European seal
population may allow its rapid spread with devastating consequences."
Dr Ailsa Hall, of the sea mammals research unit at St Andrews University,
said there was little that could be done to contain the virus. "We have
talked about vaccination, but it is really not possible in wildlife on a
grand scale," she added. "We have a network of rehabilitation centres which
can take in sickly animals. But there is not much we can do to prevent an
epidemic."
The virus was first detected in April 1988 around northern Denmark. By July
of 1988, the disease was reported around Sweden and in the Baltic Sea. In
August 1988 it appeared in Scotland before spreading south.
