Officials in Quebec's Eastern Townships are warning of a spike in ticks carrying Lyme disease, putting residents and visitors at high risk of exposure.

In 2021, the number of people infected with the disease in the region doubled compared to the year before [2020] -- 387 last year compared to 157 in 2020 -- and more than half of the people infected with Lyme disease in the province contracted it in the Eastern Townships.

"This is a serious problem, and I think that the population must take it seriously," said Bromont Mayor Louis Villeneuve. "The tick is here, we have to live with it, we have to be careful."

At a news conference held in Bromont on Thursday [3 Jun 2022], public health officials said the disease is spreading rapidly, affecting the regional county municipality of Le Granit as well as towns like Windsor and Val-des-Sources. "These were towns that were not very affected before," said Dr Geneviève Baron, a medical advisor for public health in the Eastern Townships and a member of the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network.

Lyme disease is caused by bacteria entering the body through an infected tick bite and if left untreated, can lead to long-term health problems. The most indicative symptom of Lyme disease is a circular red rash around the spot of the tick bite. Other symptoms include headache, fever and chills, fatigue, aching muscles and joints, swollen lymph nodes, and spasms or weakness. Baron said there are antibiotics available in pharmacies to help treat the bacterial infection and avoid health complications.

"The important thing is to identify it quickly because the treatment is very effective at first. In the 1st few weeks, if you are treated, it resolves easily," said Baron. Tick removal tweezers will also be offered free of charge in Bromont. Public health officials are recommending that residents adopt good habits, such as wearing long-sleeved clothing in wooded areas and inspecting themselves for ticks or tick bites following outdoor activities.

There is hope that a vaccine against the disease will soon be available as Valneva and Pfizer are expected to continue clinical trials this year [2022]. Health officials are also keeping their eye on anaplasmosis, another tick-borne disease, which is increasingly common in the Eastern Townships. Its symptoms are similar to those of the flu, but like Lyme disease, it must also be treated quickly to avoid the risk of health complications.

The Public Health Department of Estrie confirms that 387 cases of Lyme disease were declared on the territory of the CIUSSS de l'Estrie - CHUS* in 2021, compared to 157 in 2020. The region accounts for 55% of the 709 cases declared in Quebec.

Moreover, Estriens must now be extra vigilant as we are also seeing the appearance of anaplasmosis. In 2021, Estrie experienced the largest cluster of anaplasmosis reported in the country to date. Dr Geneviève Baron, Medical Adviser to the Public Health Department of Estrie recalls some prudent instructions: "Considering the considerable increase in cases of Lyme disease and the appearance of anaplasmosis in Estrie, it is very important to follow prevention advice and remove the tick with fine tweezers as soon as possible, as soon as it is discovered. The risk of transmission of diseases transmitted by ticks increases with the duration of the tick attachment." To date, Estrie has 21 municipalities where the level of risk of acquiring Lyme disease is significant and 24 municipalities where the present risk is estimated. All regional county municipalities (MRC) in the region are affected by tick-borne diseases, with the exception of Granit.

However, you should know that another disease transmitted by ticks is also present in Quebec and Estrie: little known to the public, anaplasmosis is also a disease transmitted by ticks. Its symptoms are chills, headache, muscle aches, and gastrointestinal discomfort. In most people, the symptoms of this infection are moderate or mild. However, the elderly, people with a weakened immune system, or those who delay consulting after the appearance of the 1st symptoms, can be more seriously affected and be hospitalized. People can get this disease even if they removed the tick within 24 hours of discovering it. Like Lyme disease, this disease is treated with antibiotics, but it is important to consult your doctor as soon as symptoms appear.

So be careful when venturing into the forest!

[Factors that could account for an increase in Lyme disease incidence in the Estrie region include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice, and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vector for Lyme disease in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. _I. scapularis_ likely traveled into Canada from endemic areas in the northeastern US by attaching themselves onto migrating mammals and birds (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150706143251.htm). Ticks can only climb the short distance on vegetation to a height at which they are most likely to contact their preferred host and wait (known as "questing") for a host to pass by. Nymphs quest for a blood meal at temperatures greater than 7 deg C/45 deg F (http://jtm.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/39.long).

A photo of the characteristic rash of early Lyme disease can be found at http://www.medicinenet.com/image-collection/lyme_disease_picture/picture.htm.

In the US, _I. scapularis_ can transmit simultaneously one or more of the following pathogens: _Borrelia burgdorferi_ (the spirochete that causes Lyme disease), _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ (a bacterium that causes human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Borrelia miyamotoi_ (a spirochete that causes a relapsing fever-like illness), _Babesia microti_ (the protozoan that causes babesiosis), and Powassan virus (a virus that causes encephalitis), (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2020.00142/full).

Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. Estrie (pop., about 320 000 residents in 2016) is one of 17 administrative regions in Quebec. A map of Quebec regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_Quebec. Estrie is directly north of the US states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, east of Montreal and south of Quebec City. The name Estrie replaced Eastern Townships (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrie). A map showing the location of Estrie can be found at https://www.mindat.org/loc-209851.html.

* CIUSSS de l'Estrie - CHUS is the Centre Integre Universitaire de Sante et de Services Sociaux de l'Estrie (Integrated University Health and Social Services Centres) - Centre Hospitalier Universitaire [University Hospital Centr] de Sherbrooke. Sherbrooke is the largest city in Estrie. Other major communities in Estrie include Bromont, Windsor, and Val des Sources. - Mod.ML
