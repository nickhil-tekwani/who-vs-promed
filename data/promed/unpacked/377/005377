The Connecticut Department of Public Health is investigating an _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak linked to a farm in Lebanon. As of 1 p.m. on Monday, 28 Mar 2016, DPH says it is looking at 15 confirmed cases of _E. coli_ linked to the Oak Leaf Dairy Farm in Lebanon, though that number may increase as DPH continues to identify cases that weren't initially reported. The outbreak was 1st reported on 24 Mar 2016 with 6 out of 7 _E. coli_ cases confirmed in patients who had visited the Oak Leaf Farm and come into contact with goats there.

So far, 14 of the 15 cases have directly been linked to the Oak Leaf Farm. The patients range in age from 1-44 years old, and the median age is 6. Of those who fell ill, 5 were hospitalized, and 3 remain in the hospital. Two of the hospitalized patients were also diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a rare but serious illness that impacts the kidneys and blood clotting.

The CDC sent a team to Connecticut on Sunday, 27 Mar 2016, to help investigate the outbreak, along with DPH, the Connecticut Department of Agriculture and the Uncas Health District. The farm is closed to the public.

"We received numerous phone calls and emails over the last several days from people who visited Oak Leaf Farm in March 2016. Those calls, both from individuals who may have been sickened and from individuals who've had no symptoms, are highly valuable to our ongoing investigation," said DPH Commissioner Raul Pino. "I continue to encourage anyone who visited the farm in March 2016 and developed symptoms of this illness to contact their physician. Additionally, I ask anyone who visited the farm in March 2016 to email or call DPH to let us know when you visited and if you or your family members have experienced any symptoms of _E. coli_."
