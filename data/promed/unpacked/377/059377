A dog recently adopted from the Animal Humane Society in St. Paul [Minnesota] has tested positive for canine influenza -- the 1st known case in the Twin Cities metro area.

The dog, a Shar Pei mix, is recovering. The Humane Society is halting intakes and adoptions at its St. Paul facility and expediting testing of other animals that might be sick. A 2nd possible case has been identified. The dog is undergoing testing and treatment.

The Humane Society is sending a letter to people who have adopted a dog in the past 30 days asking them to see a veterinarian if their pets show signs such as a deep cough, nasal discharge or fever. Janelle Dixon, president and CEO of the Humane Society, said the nonprofit organization is acting with "an abundance of caution." The group doesn't think the flu has spread to dogs at its other shelters, and if pets show no signs, "there's nothing to worry about," Dixon said.

The infected dog came to the Humane Society shelter 2 Jun 2015 from St. Paul Animal Control. It showed no signs of illness while there and was adopted 14 Jun 2015. While at the shelter, the dog had very limited, if any, contact with other dogs, said Dr. Graham Brayshaw, director of animal services for the Humane Society.

5 dogs at a Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, kennel were sickened in April [2015]. They fully recovered. That outbreak was believed to be linked to a dog from the Chicago [Illinois] area that visited the kennel around the same time. Chicago experienced an extensive outbreak of the H3N2 strain of canine influenza earlier in the spring.

In severe cases, the disease can cause pneumonia. It is sometimes fatal. In St. Paul, the Animal Humane Society has isolated all dogs with kennel cough or similar symptoms and is testing them for the flu. It expects to have results Friday afternoon [19 Jun 2015].
