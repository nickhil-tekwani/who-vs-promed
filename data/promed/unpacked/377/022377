Since our last report on the monkeypox situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in September [2021], a further 172 suspected cases [and three more deaths] have been reported (up to the week ending 17 Oct [2021]), according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Since the beginning of the year, 2764 cases have been reported. A total of 72 deaths have been reportedf this year [2021].

In 2020, the country saw 6257 suspected cases including 229 deaths (CFR [case fatality rate] 3.7%) that were reported in 133 health zones from 17 out of 26 provinces in the country. In 2019, 5288 suspected cases and 107 deaths (CFR 2.0%) were reported in 132 health zones from 18 provinces.

Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by a virus. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, and exhaustion, followed by a rash. Patients are usually ill for 2-4 weeks.

Infected animals such as rodents and primates can spread the virus to people (or other animals) when they bite or scratch. A person can also become infected by touching infected animals or from touching products that come from infected animals, including meat.

People infected with monkeypox can spread the virus to others through the air when they cough, sneeze, or talk. The body fluids and skin sores of a person infected with monkeypox are also infectious. Monkeypox is fatal in as many as 10% of people who get it.

[Monkeypox (MPX) continues to increase in Congo DR. As of 8 Aug 2021 there were 2523 cases reported with 66 deaths. A 22 Sep 2021 report brought the total to 2592 with 69 deaths. The report above indicates that the total has now reached 2764 cases with 3 more deaths.

As mentioned in previous reports, it is not clear how many of the reported cases above are laboratory confirmed. One wonders if many of the reported suspected cases that have not been laboratory confirmed may have been chickenpox, caused by varicella-zoster virus. There is no specific information about the circumstances under which these cases acquired their infection. However, as the report above mentions, contact with infected carrier rodents or other wild mammals may be the source of MPX virus transmission. - Mod.TY
