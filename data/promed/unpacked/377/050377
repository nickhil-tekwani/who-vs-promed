Health authorities have confirmed the number of people affected by
Victoria's worst food poisoning in 5 years has risen to 256. Victoria's
acting chief health officer Dr John Carnie said a bacterial infection was
the most likely cause of the food poisoning that affected people after a
function at the Imam Ali Islamic Centre.
"Most likely it's a bacterial infection. Some of the food had been
reheated from the day before," he said. A meal of rice, lamb, and
potatoes was served at the function which attracted about 600 people.
Dr Carnie urged people who took food home not to eat it and to
contact the Department of Human Services. "We know a number of
people took food home after the celebration at the Imam Ali Islamic
Centre in Fawkner. The danger is that if they eat it they may also fall
ill," he said.
Dr Carnie said 256 people, including children as young as one, were
taken to Melbourne hospitals late yesterday suffering from acute
stomach pains, vomiting and nausea. Quite a few were dehydrated and
treated in emergency. Luckily, the symptoms were short-lived," he said.
In all, 14 people were admitted overnight and 3 have since been
discharged.
An investigating team is at the centre today, examining the
circumstances in which the food was prepared.
Dr Carnie said food samples had been taken to a microbiology unit and
would be analysed to pinpoint the cause of the food poisoning. Results
are expected in the next few days. Dr Carnie said it was unlikely the
food poisoning was related to salmonella. He emphasised that
education regarding food preparation was essential for volunteer
groups as well as commercial operators. "The main issue is making
sure people understand the guidelines," he said.
Dr Carnie said problems may occur when people try to cater for large
numbers. "Any food left over should be reheated at the right
temperature," he said. Cold food should be stored below 5 degrees
while hot food should be reheated to 60 degrees. Dr Carnie said
pamphlets on food preparation are currently available in English and
other languages and additional kits will soon be translated into 22
languages.
This outbreak is believed to be the biggest since the pork roll food
poisoning in 1997 [see refs above.
