The widespread use of antibiotics in hospitals triggered the emergence of 2 resistant strains of the _Clostridium_ superbug that has killed thousands of people worldwide over the past 2 decades, a study has shown.

A genetic analysis of about 300 samples of _Clostridium difficile_ bacteria collected from around the world found that the global outbreaks were in fact caused by 2 different strains that had independently acquired resistance to an antibiotic widely used in hospitals.

Scientists traced the evolutionary trees of each strain of _C. difficile_ and found that both originated within a couple of years of each other, one in a hospital in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and the other in Montreal, Canada.

International travellers carried the Canadian strain to Britain and the rest of Europe, where it caused a notorious series of outbreaks in UK hospitals between 2003 and 2006, leading to hundreds of patients dying from bowel complications.

"We used advanced DNA sequencing to determine the evolutionary history of this epidemic and the subsequent pattern of global spread," said Miao He, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, which carried out the genetic analysis. "We found that this outbreak came from 2 separate epidemic strains or lineages of _C. difficile_, both emerging from North America over a very short period and rapidly spread between hospitals around the world."

The study found that both strains of bacteria had undergone the same tiny mutation in a key gene that conferred resistance to the fluoroquinolone [class of] antibiotics. Once resistance had evolved, the 2 strains quickly spread among hospital patients in North America and then Europe.

Trevor Lawley, the leader of the study at the Sanger Institute, said: "Until this research we didn't realise that the same mutation had actually happened twice, independently of one another. It shows that this is not a rare event and can happen again. There is a link between acquiring resistance and appearance of these mutations around the world, and the use of the antibiotics."

The study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, said the evolution and persistence of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of _C. difficile_ was likely to be the result of widespread use of this class of antibiotics in North America in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Professor Brendan Wren, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, one of co-authors of the study, said: "Up until the early 2000s, fluoroquinolones were an effective treatment of _C. difficile_ infection. We've seen that since these strains acquired resistance to this frontline antibiotic, not only is it now virtually useless against this organism, but resistance seems to have been a major factor in the continued evolution and persistence of these strains in hospitals and clinical settings."

The strain that evolved in the US, known as FQR1, later began to circulate in hospitals in Switzerland and South Korea. The strain that evolved Canada, called FQR2, spread far further, to Australia, France, Britain, and other parts of Europe.

The scientists believe the outbreaks of FQR2 in British hospitals can be traced to 3 separate transmissions -- from North America to hospitals in Exeter, Ayreshire, and Birmingham. Another transmission, in Maidstone, came from Europe.

[_Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_. Recent outbreaks of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain, which hyper-produces toxins A and B due to a deletion in a regulatory gene and is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1 (NAP1) and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027.

This epidemic strain is characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use of which is one risk factor for disease due to 027/NAP1 (Drudy D, Kyne L, O'Mahony R, Fanning S: gyrA mutations in fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027 [letter]. Emerg Infect Dis 2007; 13(3): 504-5; available at http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm).

The news report above refers to an article recently published by Miao He et al (see below). The investigators showed that the global epidemic of _Clostridium difficile_ 027/NAP1 in the early to mid-2000s was caused by the spread of 2 different but highly related strains of the bacterium, FQR1 and FQR2. The spread and persistence of both epidemics were driven by the acquisition of resistance to fluoroquinolone antibiotics:

Abstract
--------
Epidemic _C. difficile_ (027/BI/NAP1) has rapidly emerged in the past decade as the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea worldwide. However, the key events in evolutionary history leading to its emergence and the subsequent patterns of global spread remain unknown. Here, we define the global population structure of _C. difficile_ 027/BI/NAP1 using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. We show that 2 distinct epidemic lineages, FQR1 and FQR2, not one as previously thought, emerged in North America within a relatively short period after acquiring the same fluoroquinolone resistance-conferring mutation and a highly related conjugative transposon. The 2 epidemic lineages showed distinct patterns of global spread, and the FQR2 lineage spread more widely, leading to healthcare-associated outbreaks in the UK, continental Europe, and Australia. Our analysis identifies key genetic changes linked to the rapid transcontinental dissemination of epidemic _C. difficile_ 027/BI/NAP1 and highlights the routes by which it spreads through the global healthcare system.

For a map showing the global spread of lineages FQR1 and FQR2, see Figure 2: Transmission events inferred for epidemic _C. difficile_ 027/BI/NAP1 that is available at http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ng.2478.html#/supplementary-information. - Mod.ML]
