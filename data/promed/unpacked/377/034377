Watermelon farmers in the flood-prone areas in Kendrapara district are worried as an unidentified disease has affected their crops. The 'mystery' disease has caused the watermelons to break open and rot much before harvesting.

The fruits are being affected when they grow to the size of 1 kg [2.2 lb]. The farmers have applied pesticides on the advice of agriculture and horticulture experts, but that is not helping in any way. They are trying to tide over this crisis by harvesting the melons when they are still small, but traders are refusing [them]. The watermelons are [normally] harvested when they grow up to the size of 3-5 kg [6.6-11 lb].

Another farmer said watermelon plants have withered, and small watermelons are getting decomposed. Residents have demanded that Agriculture department should rush a high-level team to the area to review the crop damage and make provision of financial assistance to the affected farmers.

[A large number of pathogens can affect cucurbit crops, which include watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_); melons and cucumbers (_Cucumis_ spp.); and squashes, gourds, and pumpkins (_Cucurbita_ spp.). The symptoms described above may point to some form of fungal or bacterial rot, but reliable diagnosis of any pathogens affecting the melons will be essential for designing suitable management strategies for the affected farmers. The problems above may also be due to a combination of pathogens and/or other factors.
