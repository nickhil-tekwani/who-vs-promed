[1] Influenza A (H3N2) confirmed, MERS-CoV ruled out
Date: Thu 6 Sep 2018
From: ProMED-mail
<promed@promedmail.org>


We have learned from a reliable source that influenza A (H3N2) has been confirmed in the individuals admitted to Jamaica Hospital, having arrived yesterday (Wed 5 Sep 2018) at JFK on an Emirates Airlines flight that originated in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. One individual was also evaluated for gastroenteritis and was influenza virus-negative. All individuals testing positive for influenza virus were treated with oseltamivir. All individuals were tested for MERS-CoV, and all were negative.

[It is not surprising that there were influenza A (H3N2)-confirmed infected individuals presenting with a classic ILI (influenza-like illness) when evaluated medically. It is also not surprising that all ill individuals tested negative for MERS-CoV, as it would have been very unusual for an outbreak of MERS-CoV to present in this way, with 10 individuals on the same flight to have been exposed to MERS-CoV and be symptomatic on the same flight.

The final piece of information will be if there are additional cases of influenza reported among passengers of this flight in the next 24-72 hours that might be consistent with transmission of the virus on the flight. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Saudi Arabia, influenza update

Influenza activity in Saudi Arabia post-Hajj
---------
Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health and the Infectious Hazard Management (IHM) unit, WHO/EMRO, continues to monitor the progress of influenza data entry on the regional platform, EMFLU Network. Based on that, a weekly report for the influenza situation in Saudi Arabia is generated.

Three of the influenza sentinel surveillance sites are within the Hajj premises. The overall activity is low (see https://twitter.com/abassiri5/status/1037762645280079872?s=21).

[Many thanks to Dr. Abdullah Assiri for sending this surveillance information on. I recommend that readers follow the link to Dr. Assiri's tweet showing the surveillance results for influenza in Saudi Arabia. Based on the information we have received via media reports (see below), the majority of the individuals referred to the hospital for symptomatic febrile respiratory illness from the Emirates flight were crew members and not returning Hajji's, suggesting that the transmission of the influenza virus may not have originated in Saudi Arabia. - Mod.MPP]

[3] Media update on situation

Eleven people were treated at a local hospital after a plane carrying sick passengers landed at John F. Kennedy Airport Wednesday [5 Sep 2018].

Around 100 people on Emirates Flight 203 from Dubai complained of illness with symptoms including cough and fever before being officially evaluated, Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Infectious Disease Media Team, told TIME. Emirates, however, said that only about 10 of the roughly 500 passengers on the flight "were taken ill."

Eric Phillips, press secretary for New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's office, tweeted about 3 hours after the plane landed that all passengers had disembarked. (Though Phillips initially said the plane was quarantined, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey did not escalate the incident to that level of formal response.) Ten sick people were initially taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens, while another 9 were found to be ill but declined further medical treatment. One person on the plane sought treatment for unrelated symptoms later in the day, Jamaica Hospital representatives said in a statement Thursday [6 Sep 2018].

A Jamaica Hospital spokesperson said in a statement provided to TIME that patients brought to the hospital had symptoms including cough, fever, sore throat, and headache. Test results came back positive for influenza, Phillips tweeted Thursday [6 Sep 2018] morning.

Ten of the 11 patients were discharged by Thursday [6 Sep 2018] afternoon, according to Jamaica Hospital representatives, while the final patient remained at the hospital for flu treatment.

Vanilla Ice was apparently among the more than 500 passengers on the A380 aircraft. The rapper tweeted a video of the scene on the tarmac and called the situation "crazy" in a separate tweet. "So I just landed from Dubai, and now there is like tons of ambulances and fire trucks and police all over the place," he wrote. "Apparently there is [sic] over 100 people sick on the bottom floor, so happy I'm up top, it's a double-decker plane 380," he added in another tweet.
