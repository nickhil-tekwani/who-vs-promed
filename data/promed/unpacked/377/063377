A cluster of 5 cases (4 children and an adult) of Vero
cytotoxin-producing _E. coli_ O157 (VTEC O157) with links to home
paddling pools was identified in Greater Manchester in June 2006.
Investigation by Greater Manchester Health Protection Unit and the
local environmental health department revealed that the initial
source of exposure may have been that the index case (one of the
children) had been playing in a local brook and had fallen in during
the 10 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The common
epidemiological link for the remaining children was that they had all
shared home paddling pools with the index case while the index case
was still symptomatic with diarrhea. The adult case was the parent
of one of the affected children. Exclusion criteria for nurseries
and schools were applied as per national guidance. Three of the
children were admitted to hospital with hemolytic uraemic syndrome
(HUS) but all appear to have made a good recovery.
Isolates from all cases were confirmed as being phage type (PT) 21/28
with genes for Vero cytotoxin 2. This is the most common VTEC O157
type in the UK. Comparison of the isolates from the 4 children by the
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens using pulsed field gel
electrophoresis showed that 3 had indistinguishable profiles and one
had a profile clearly related to this.
Levels of chlorination in domestic water supplies are typically not
sufficient to disinfect a home paddling pool. Although the reported
occurrence of such events appears to be uncommon, key public health
messages which may help reduce the risk of similar events include:
- anyone with symptoms suggestive of an infective gastrointestinal
illness should not use paddling pools/swimming pools while
symptomatic and for 2 weeks after resolution of symptoms;
- home paddling pools should be emptied on a daily basis and
thoroughly cleaned and dried after use;
- pools should be covered if left out overnight;
- appropriate footwear should be worn when going over outdoor areas
to and from pools.

[Although _E. coli_ O157 is most often associated with undercooked
ground beef, or contaminated food, the disease can also be
transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. In the
spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an
outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults
and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.
Pool-associated transmission is illustrated in the references.
