The number of cases of scarlet fever has hit an all time high in Wrexham and Flintshire (counties in northeastern Wales) over the last 2 years [2014, 2015]. More than 200 cases have been reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) across the 2 counties since 2014 with a high of 73 recorded in Wrexham in 2014. That eclipsed the highest number of 9, set in 1997 when figures issued by PHW began. Figures in Flintshire peaked at 47, also in 2014, which surpassed a previous high of 5 in 2011. In 2013, just 3 cases were reported across the county. Across Wales, 283 cases of scarlet fever have already been reported this year [2016].

Last week, Public Health England reported steep increases in scarlet fever with a total of 6157 new cases since the season began in September 2015. This is the 3rd season in a row where the incidence of scarlet fever has shown a marked elevation.

In 2015, figures reached a peak of 55 in Wrexham but were recorded at less than half in neighbouring Flintshire at 26. This year [2016] to date, 7 patients have presented with the infection in Flintshire with 12 cases in Wrexham.

Wrexham GP and Leader medical columnist Dr Peter Saul said it was important to ensure the condition was properly diagnosed. He said: "Increases are usually down to a reduction in immunity in the local area or a change in the bacteria which cause infection. As people in North East Wales aren't different to the rest of us across the UK, I'd say the bacteria have changed and become more aggressive in accessing the body." He said parents who detect symptoms in their children should not panic. "I wouldn't say parents should lose any sleep over this," he added. "If a child has a bright red rash, take them to a doctor, but otherwise don't worry."
