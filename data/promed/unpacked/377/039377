[Fassuta is a village in the Western Galilee, Northern ("Hazafon") district, about 2 km (1.24 mi) from the Lebanese border (map at https://tinyurl.com/y764f4bh). Earlier rabies cases in the same village involved 2 dogs (26 Feb 2020 and 27 Apr 2020). A dynamic map presenting them (zoom in to view the 3 separate cases in this cluster), as well as the other rabies cases reported in Israel during 2020, is available at https://moag.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a6d8aae5cbc04c958d5efefd2724318f. Click the "legend" (red = cattle, pink = dog, aqua = jackal).

Of the 18 cases reported since 1 Jan 2020 (10 dogs, 4 jackals, 4 cattle), 17 were located along the Lebanese border, facing Lebanon's southern region. An oral vaccination regimen, for the immunisation of the wildlife rabies reservoir (foxes and jackals), was initially introduced to Israel experimentally/regionally in the late 1990s, followed by countrywide application since the early 2000s. This generally successful regimen suffered some drawbacks due to introductions of rabid canids from rabies-stricken neighboring territories. This happened in 2017-2018, when rabies spread from northwestern Jordan into Israel's northeastern valleys, infecting primarily jackals, which, for reasons yet to be established, were not sufficiently protected. Improved oral vaccination efforts contributed to the termination of the event.

While annual dog rabies vaccination in Israel is compulsory by law, vaccination of livestock is voluntary. In view of the situation along northern frontiers, the VSAH have issued, on 27 May 2020, a recommendation to all cattle and sheep owners in the said vulnerable territory to vaccinate their animals. An unvaccinated cattle/sheep herd in which rabies occurs is put, according to law and subject to public health considerations, under movement restrictions for 90 days, including slaughter ban. The restriction period in vaccinated livestock is 45 days. A map, presenting the areas involved, was published and is available at https://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/VetBasade/Pirsumim/2020/Documents/sikun_gavoah_kalevet_2020.pdf.

VSAH's web page "Rabies - 2020", with links to details of each of the 18 cases reported in Hazafon district as of 2 Jun 2020, is available at https://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Pages/default.aspx (in Hebrew; please note that Google translate turns the Hebrew for jackal, "Tan", into the English "Let").

The abundance of rabies cases in stray dogs and wildlife assumed to prevail in south Lebanon (Janoub/Nabatieh governorates), challenging the local population, warrants control and preventive measures urgently applied. According to a recent review (Ref 1) addressing human rabies in Lebanon, the Nabatieh governorate suffered the highest rate of human bites in the country (56.31/100 000). - Mod.AS
