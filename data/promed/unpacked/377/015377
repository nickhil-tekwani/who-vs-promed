Mayo worker put patients at risk for hepatitis
----------------------------------------------
The [registered] letter in her mailbox on Wednesday [22 Sep 2010]
surprised a Tavares woman, but not nearly as much as its contents.
While she was a patient at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, a rogue
employee in the radiology department was injecting himself with a
potent painkiller intended for patients and refilling the syringes
with saline. He had hepatitis C, a potentially deadly virus that
attacks the liver. "Apparently, he did this for many years before he
was caught," said the former patient, who asked not to be named
because it might stigmatize her.

She is among 5000 former patients at the Florida branch of the
renowned Mayo Clinic to receive the warning letter, which has been
mailed out in 2 waves this month [September 2010]. "I have never felt
more safe than I was at the Mayo Clinic," said the Tavares woman, who
underwent heart and kidney operations at the Mayo Clinic in 2006 and
2007. "For this to happen, I think is horrible." On Thursday [23 Sep
2010], the Mayo Clinic sent a team to her home to draw blood for
testing for hepatitis C, hepatitis B, and HIV infection. So far, 3
former patients have tested positive for hepatitis C [virus infection].

In August [2010], a 47-year-old former radiology technician, was
fired after admitting he had used painkillers prescribed for
patients. He was arrested last month [August 2010] on a minor felony
related to stealing drugs. But law-enforcement officials say he could
face more charges as the investigation continues. The radiology
technician worked at the Mayo from 11 Oct 2004, up to 21 Aug 2010. He
worked in Interventional Radiology at St Luke's Hospital from 2004 to
11 Apr 2008, when Mayo Clinic owned St Luke's Hospital.

"We want to ensure that every patient who might be at risk is
tested," said Dr William C Rupp, chief executive officer of Mayo
Clinic in Florida. "We want to cast as wide a net as possible to make
sure we've included any possible patient." That, Rupp said, has
included tracking down every patient who had a procedure on the days
the technician was working and in the section of the hospital where
he was working. Most of the affected patients are from Florida, Rupp
said, but letters also have been sent to several living in the
Southeast and a few who live abroad.

The former employee has tested negative for hepatitis B virus and
HIV, Rupp said, but the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, as well as the Florida Department of Health, urged that
former patients be tested for those viruses as well. So far, 3
patients have been diagnosed with cases of hepatitis C that are
genetically similar to the type the technician has, Mayo officials
said. One of those patients died from the virus [infection], another
died from an unrelated illness, and the 3rd remains alive. Hepatitis
C virus attacks the liver but often doesn't cause symptoms for years.
Left untreated, it can cause severe problems, such as cirrhosis and
liver cancer.

The American Hospital Association described the Mayo technician's
actions as "egregious and criminal," said spokesman Matt Fenwick. He
called upon hospitals to work hard to "ensure it doesn't happen
again." For their part, Mayo Clinic officials say they are taking
steps to improve security related to narcotics. Among the new
safeguards: Mayo nurses will now initial every syringe when it's
drawn so that it can't be switched without notice.

[The initial report in ProMED-mail on 24 Aug 2010 of 3 cases of
hepatitis C virus contracted from a radiology technician at the Mayo
Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, did not explain the circumstances
surrounding this incident. It is now revealed that the affected
individuals were surgical or transplant patients, one of whom died
subsequently as a result of hepatitis C virus infection. These
patients, and possibly others (up to 5000 are being contacted), were
infected by the actions a single technician in the radiology
department who was injecting himself with a potent narcotic intended
for patients and refilling the syringes with saline. Subsequent
analysis revealed that the employee was a hepatitis C virus carrier.
It remains to be established whether any other patients at risk have
been infected. At the time of the incident the errant technician
tested negative for both hepatitis B virus and HIV infection.
