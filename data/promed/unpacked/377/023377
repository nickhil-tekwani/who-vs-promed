Rabbit owners warned about myxomatosis outbreak in Herefordshire
----------------------------------------------------------------
Rabbit owners are being warned to be extra vigilant after 4 animals caught myxomatosis.

Brookfield Veterinary Practice, based in Old Eign Hill, Hereford, fears there might be an outbreak of the severe viral disease in the county after it had to put 4 rabbits to sleep in the past month.

The disease can cause blindness and is usually spread by biting insects such as fleas and mosquitoes carrying the myxo virus and can cause severe suffering to rabbits that have not been vaccinated.

"Myxomatosis poses a threat to all pet rabbits, but the risk varies depending on whether your rabbit lives inside or outside," said Becky Bridges, a veterinary nurse at Brookfield. "Pet rabbits at greatest risk are those living outside, especially if they may have any contact with wild rabbits or hares.

"Rabbit owners who may also have a dog or cat that hunts wild rabbits, or foxes that visit the garden and nose around rabbit hutches, must be particularly careful in case rabbit fleas are brought back to the pet bunny.

"House rabbits living permanently indoors are at less risk than outdoor rabbits, but do get myxomatosis. They must be vaccinated and protected from possible sources of myxomatosis transmission too."

[Myxomatosis is a major disease of the European rabbit caused by the Myxoma virus, a member of the Poxviridae family. The diagnosis of myxomatosis, regardless of its clinical form, depends on the isolation and identification of the virus or the demonstration of its antigens. The presence of a humoral immune response facilitates a retrospective diagnosis of a mild form of the disease and can provide an indication of the prevalence of infection in a rabbit population. The disease is characterised by gross myxomatous skin lesions. It is not zoonotic.

The disease is OIE-listed; background information and data on diagnosis and vaccine are available in chapter 2.6.1 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2012, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.01_MYXO.pdf.


In the UK, myxomatosis is not reportable. UK's annual 2011 report to the OIE indicated that the disease was not reported for 2011 in domestic animals, "since unknown." Clinical disease was, reportedly, present in wildlife; no quantitative data or locations given. - Mod.AS
