The NJ State Department of Health is investigating 6 _E. coli_ cases in 4 counties that may be connected to the same restaurant chain. The cases were reported in Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset and Warren counties with the 1st being reported by a hospital on [28 Mar 2018], State Epidemiologist Dr. Tina Tan told New Jersey 101.5. Tan said the state is working with both the FDA and CDC in their investigation.

The cases may be connected to different locations of a restaurant chain, according to Tank. She would not name the chain until an investigation could make a stronger connection. Tan added that the department is in the process of gathering food history data because it can be very difficult to determine where someone got sick.

"Individuals could have eaten a number of meals in a number of places before getting sick. They could have eaten at several restaurants, at home or eaten food purchased at a supermarket. Sometimes the source of the food that made people sick is never determined. That's why we conduct many interviews with sick individuals to get food history data," Tan said. She said the state lab will determine if the strains of _E. coli_ match and the CDC will do another test to confirm.

_E. coli_, or _Escherichia coli_, is a bacteria that normally lives harmlessly in the intestines of people and animals, according to the CDC. Some types are pathogenic and can cause illness through exposure to contaminated food or water or contact with animals or other people. Symptoms include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Someone who is exposed may have symptoms within 3 or 4 days, but there are cases where it starts within a day. Some infections with recovery within 5 to 7 days. Other cases can be severe and even life threatening.

[Although not specifically stated, it is very likely that the strain of _E. coli_ found is a Shiga toxin producing one (enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_).

The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ are zoonotic bacteria of livestock, particularly cattle and can be transmitted to humans in a variety of ways, including via undercooked meat (especially ground beef), direct contact with animals such as at a petting zoo and contamination (at any time from the field, during harvest, during processing, or in a restaurant or home) of produce. _E. coli_ O157:H7 is the prototypic strain and was the strain associated with the initial fast food outbreak of hemorrhagic diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome from undercooked ground beef in the early 1980s. Since the incubation period of this infection can be as long as 10 days after exposure and is longer than the usual enteric infection, additional primary cases may still occur. Also, 2ary household cases can occur.

ProMED-mail awaits additional information regarding this potentially growing outbreak. - Mod.LL
