Suspicious cases of anthrax in Vardenis district of Armenia's Gegharkunik region were reported to the Armenian Health Ministry a few days ago. After receiving the report, the ministry [was] ordered to conduct an epidemiologic study and to take preventive measures.

Samples were taken for testing from 15 people hospitalized with suspected anthrax on 17 Oct 2012. According to the Health Ministry, the results of laboratory tests show that an anthrax diagnosis is confirmed only for one patient; non-pathogenic cases of anthrax have been revealed in 9 samples, and 5 samples tested negative. Doctors assess the condition of the patients as satisfactory.

According to the latest data, one person was hospitalized in Yerevan and 21 in Martuni.

Laboratory tests are underway for the rest of samples. Preventive measures are being implemented. The epidemiological situation is under control.

The people who were most at risk for anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, and tannery and wool workers. Anthrax does not spread from person to person.

[A parallel report also has 22 people hospitalised: http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/society/32838.html.

A low confirmation rate in suspect anthrax cases is not unusual. My late respected colleague Benyamin Cherkasskiy would tell me that in his experience, one was lucky to get 30 percent confirmation; he found that the best results came from sampling the toxic fluid underneath the lesion. The commonest cause for culture failure with humans is that they self treat with antibiotics before presenting themselves to their physician. And as the vegetative cell is very sensitive to antibiotics, and the majority of hospital clinics cannot do PCR diagnoses, it is "negative."

I have no idea what a "non-pathogenic case of anthrax" might be. If there were no signs of inflammation or lymph node enlargement, there would be no reason to sample nor any site to sample. Something has been lost in the translation. While one might suggest a PCR diagnosis, it is difficult to perceive why the hospital would have a plasmid test to hand when the disease is so infrequent in Armenians.

The only anthrax cases in Armenia have been reported in cattle and humans. Latterly, it was reported by OIE in humans, 2 cases, in 2008; ProMED has reports of human cases (2) in 2006, 2005 (1), 2004 (suspected), 2003 (2), 2001 (18), and 1999 (1). Over the years, there is a pitter-patter of cases. The most recent known livestock outbreaks were in 2007 and 2006, and some 40 dead cows in 2004, plus some dogs died. It is a characteristic of the one-time Soviet countries to emphasise human cases of (suspected) anthrax and to essentially ignore livestock outbreaks; unfortunately, this species bias has persisted, and it reflects a public health non-appreciation of where control must start, by vaccinating livestock, not in expensively hospitalising suspected human cases. - Mod.MHJ
