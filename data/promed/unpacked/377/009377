Thousands of pigs have died from [porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (PRRS)] at one farm, as Pitt County pork
producers report a spike in the ailment caused by a virus.
Ronald Evans said 8000 pigs at his farm died between August [2006]
and March [2007] from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome,
which weakens the animal's resistance. "It's been a very trying
time," Evans said.
The disease is caused by a virus and costs the pork industry some USD
560 million annually, said a study published in 2005 in the Journal
of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.
Determining the extent of the disease in North Carolina is difficult
because the state doesn't track PRRS, said State Veterinarian Dr.
David Marshall.
Other farmers in Pitt County have reported spikes in the disease,
said agricultural extension agent Phillip Rowan.
The disease is more vigorous during cold weather, so the outbreak has
cooled as spring temperatures rise, Evans said.
