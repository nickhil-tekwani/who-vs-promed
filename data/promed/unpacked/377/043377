Fish poisoning in Uganda has led to the closure of over 300 fish
landing sites along Lake Victoria, said Ken Lukyamuzi, Member of
Parliament for Lubaga South district.
"Nearly 300 landing sites have been closed in 10 districts, and
about 87 people have been hospitalized due to fish poisoning,"
Lukyamuzi told a seminar organized by the Natural Resources
Committee of Parliament in conjunction with Konrad Adenauer
Foundation at the International Conference Center recently.
Lukyamuzi said press reports showed 5 people had died while 87
were reported ill in and around Kampala after eating poisoned fish.
He said the East African region needed a collaborative approach in
fighting the fish poison before it is institutionalized in some villages.
He said application of chemicals in water causes extensive effects
to non-target aquatic species due to its non-selective nature,
leading to a massive loss of bio-diversity of aquatic lives. He said
the number of people engaged in the fisheries sector had gone
down from about 800 000 people following the ban imposed by the
European Union on the purchase of Ugandan fish exports, and the
private sector had cut down its staff by about 70 because they
could no longer afford to pay them.
