According to the Ministry of Health, 22 cases of hantavirus [infections] were registered in Brazil, with 10 confirmed deaths through September 2022.

In Brazil, the wild rodents known as wood mouse and rice mouse (_Akodon_ sp. and _Oligoryzomys_ sp, respectively) are hantavirus reservoirs and differ from those most frequently found in urban environments because they are small (the adult male reaches 25 grams) and live close to crops, mainly grain.

The disease can cause hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). It is an acute viral zoonosis caused by an RNA virus, belonging to the Hantaviridae family and _Orthohantavirus_ genus. Human infection occurs mainly by inhalation of aerosols in the form of dust generated by sweeping, formed from the urine, feces, and saliva of infected rodents. Other forms of transmission are skin abrasions or rodent bites, and contact of the virus with the conjunctival mucosa, mouth, or nose via hands contaminated with rodent excreta.

From contact with the virus, about 1 to 5 weeks on average, in the initial phase, the most common symptoms are fever, joint pain, headache, lower back, and abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and vomiting. When it reaches the cardiopulmonary phase, it is common for the person to experience fever, difficulty breathing, breathing accelerated, heart rate intensity, dry cough, and low blood pressure. In this phase, it is also possible to develop noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, with the patient progressing to acute respiratory failure and circulatory shock. Therefore, if you present signs and symptoms suggestive of hantavirus, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible.

There is no specific treatment. Supportive therapeutic measures are recommended.

Control measures must contain actions such as, for example, clearing the land around the house, giving adequate disposal to existing trash, and keeping food stored in closed and rodent-proof containers, in addition to other measures that prevent human interaction. and wild rodents, in places where the presence of these animals is known. Avoid handling rodents, even dead ones. If this is necessary, it is important to wear rubber gloves and wash your hands immediately afterward.

[The hantaviruses involved in these 22 cases are not mentioned nor the localities where these cases occurred. ProMED has posted relatively few cases of hantavirus infection in Brazil. The ProMED report of cases in Brazil dated 23 Feb 2008 (see Hantavirus update 2008 - Americas (10): Brazil (MG) 20080702.2020) indicated that hantaviruses circulating in Mato Grosso included: Laguna Negra, which has the _Calomys callosus_ rodent host, and Castelo dos Sonhos which had previously been found in Para state, but without a known host. Field research found that, in Mato Grosso, the rodent _Oligoryzomys moojeni_ was the host of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus. Araraquara virus infection has also caused HPS in Brazil. Its rodent host is _Necromys [Bolomys] lasiurus_ in Brazil. Anajatuba virus is a possible etiological agent of HPS in Brazil. Its rodent host is _O. fornesi_ in Brazil. As Dr Jan Clement and his colleagues pointed out in their comments, Seoul hantavirus should be considered as an etiological agent responsible for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Americas, and there is evidence for its presence in Brazil (see Hantavirus - Americas (54): Panama (LS) comment, Brazil 20171024.5398648). - Mod.TY
