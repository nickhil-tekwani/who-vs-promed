Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Oman 12 Sep 2017
-----------------------------------
On [30 Aug 2017], the national IHR focal point of Oman reported one case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The last report of MERS-CoV from Oman was on [29 Nov 2016].

Details of the case
Detailed information concerning the case, a 54-year-old male living in Al Musanaa Batinah region, reported to WHO can be found in a separate document (see link below).

MERS-CoV case reported on [30 Aug 2017]

Date of notification to WHO / Reporting country / City of residence / Age / Sex / Health care worker / Comorbidities / Exposure to camels / Camel milk consumption / Exposure to MERS-CoV cases / Date of symptoms onset / Date of 1st hospitalization / Date of laboratory confirmation / Status
2017-08-30 / Oman / Al Musanaa Batinah / 54 / M / No / Yes / No / No / No / 2017-08-09 / 2017-08-21 / 2017-08-29 / Alive

Globally, 2080 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 722 related deaths have been reported to WHO.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health in Oman is conducting contact tracing and follow-up of family and health care workers at the hospitals where the patient was treated. Laboratory testing for symptomatic and high-risk family contacts, including health care workers, is underway. Community members and those who have been in contact with the patient are being educated on infection prevention, mass gatherings, travel, and other related topics, following Oman MERS-CoV National Preparedness and Response Guidelines.

[As stated above, this is the 1st case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman in 2017. With the addition of this case, it is now the 9th laboratory confirmed case reported to WHO, in addition to 2 cases from Oman confirmed and reported by Thailand. According to the above summary on the case, the date of onset of illness was 9 Aug 2017; the date of admission to hospital was 21 Aug 2017, and the date of laboratory confirmation was 29 Aug 2017. In the absence of information on the clinical course during this period, it is difficult to know whether the location of transmission was outside of the hospital or after admission to the hospital. It is also curious that the tracing and follow-up of family and healthcare workers mentions "hospitals," suggesting there were multiple exposures to different healthcare institutions during the time frame of this illness, so exposure to an unrecognized case of MERS-CoV infection in the healthcare environment is a possibility.

We await further information on this case and results of contact tracing, including other patients that may have been present at the healthcare facilities while this patient was there during the period preceding confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.

As of [Mon 11 Sep 2017], there have been a total of:
1716 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
690 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.3 percent],
1004 recoveries, and
20 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Note that as of 5 PM GMT-4, there were no reports on additional cases/recoveries/deaths since 11 Sep 2017 on the MOH website. In addition, there was no report for 9 Sep 2017 available on the website, although there was an increase of an additional recovery not specified on the 10 Sep 2017 report. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [7 Sep 2017], there have been a total of:
1 newly confirmed case,
1 newly reported fatality, and
1 newly reported recovery.

Information on newly reported cases (1 case):
Date: 8 Sep 2017 (1 case)

- A 61-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Alzulfi [Riyadh region] noted to be in stable condition. Classified as a primary case with high risk exposure history still under investigation.

- A 57-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Hayel (Hail) [Hail region] with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a newly confirmed case on 2 Sep 2017, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. Classified as a primary case with a history of indirect contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly reported recovery (1 recovery)

Classified as a secondary case in a household contact. - Mod.MPP]

[As mentioned previously, in the absence of cases identified through contact tracing, it appears as though Saudi Arabia has returned to an endemic picture of sporadic cases being reported from different localities around the country. Since the last update last week (on 7 Sep 2017), there has been one newly confirmed case, identified as a primary case, but full high risk exposure history was still under investigation.
