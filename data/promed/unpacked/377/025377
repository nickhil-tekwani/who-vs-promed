Indonesia: Suspected 43rd Avian Influenza Death
-----------------------------------------------
A 16-year-old Indonesian has died from bird flu, a health official
said, citing local test results which are usually reliable. The
teenager, a resident of Cikarang district on the southern outskirts
of Jakarta, died at the Sulianti Saroso hospital for avian influenza
patients, hospital spokesman Ilham Patu said on Monday [7 Aug 2006].
"His condition was stable earlier today, but it deteriorated in the
late afternoon, and he could not be saved," Patu told Agence France
Presse (AFP).
If confirmed by a World Health Organization-affiliated laboratory,
the death would be Indonesia's 43rd, making the world's 4th most
populous country the nation with the highest number of bird flu
deaths in the world [one more than Viet Nam]. Patu said he was still
waiting for results from the WHO-affiliated laboratory but added that
those results "will most likely match our tests" once they are announced.

Thailand: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed the country's
24th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
case, which was fatal, occurred in a 27-year-old man from the central
province of Uthai Thani. He developed symptoms on 24 Jul 2006, was
hospitalized on 30 Jul 2006, and died on 3 Aug 2006. Investigation of
his source of infection revealed contact with household chickens,
which began dying around one week prior to symptom onset.
This is the country's 2nd case of H5N1 infection and 2nd fatality
within the past 2 weeks. Confirmation of these cases follows an
8-month period in which no human cases were reported in the country.
