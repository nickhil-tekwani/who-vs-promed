--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In recent years, citrus trees have been seriously affected by the prokaryotic pathogen, _Spiroplasma citri_ that causes stubborn disease. The aim of the present study was identification of _S. citri_ based on symptoms, isolation, molecular detection and vegetative transmission, as well as to update the current status of _S. citri_ affecting citrus growing areas of Pakistan.

_S. citri_ was isolated from infected leaves and parts of fruits. Inoculated culture media showed the initial presence of _S. citri_. Typically, fried egg shape colonies were observed on solid media. For molecular detection of _S. citri_, DNA was extracted from leaf samples and spiroplasma specific PCR was used to amplify spiraline gene sequences, giving a 675 bp product. Pathogenicity tests were performed. Upon successful grafting, symptoms were observed that confirmed the presence of disease.

This represents the 1st-time identification of _S. citri_ in cultures, biologically and molecularly in the citrus orchards of Sargodha district.

Citrus stubborn is considered an emerging disease in Pakistan. There is little information regarding this disease. It is responsible, along with other pathogens, for decline in citrus orchards. It is crucial to isolate and detect the citrus stubborn pathogen first to manage the disease efficiently and prescribe control measures.

[_Spiroplasma citri_ causes citrus stubborn disease (CSD; also called little leaf). Symptoms of CSD may include stunting of trees, misshapen fruit, rosetting, distortion of leaves, and off-season flowering. Yield losses may be severe. The pathogen is also known to affect other crops causing, for example, carrot purple leaf (see ProMED-mail post 20110916.2824) and horseradish brittle root diseases. In carrots, mixed infections with phytoplasmas have been reported to occur. _S. citri_ strains from different locations and hosts have been shown to have a high degree of genetic variability, but no host specificity of strains has been identified.

The pathogen is transmitted by _Circulifer tenellus_ (beet leafhopper) and other leafhopper species. Both the pathogen and vector species have wide host ranges resulting in many potential pathogen and/or vector reservoirs. Disease management for spiroplasmas mainly relies on exclusion by use of certified clean planting material, but may also include phytosanitation to remove inoculum and prevent spread within plantings. Vector control has not shown to be effective due to the very rapid transmission.

The related _S. kunkelii_ causes corn stunt disease on _Zea_ species in the Americas.

Spiroplasmas are plant cell parasitic bacteria without a cell wall and, like phytoplasmas, belong to the mollicutes. The name is derived from their helical morphology. Spiroplasmas can be cultured on artificial media, unlike phytoplasmas, which cannot be cultured in vitro.
