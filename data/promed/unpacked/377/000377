Regarding the poxvirus in squirrels: Are the researchers confident this is
not parapox virus infection which is currently threatening the UK red
squirrel and occasional UK grey squirrels?
Grey squirrels introduced from the USA [years ago are thought to be the
natural host. The disease causes skin granulomas and skin sores.

there is a researcher who has a definitive answer, we would appreciate
knowing - Mod.TG
