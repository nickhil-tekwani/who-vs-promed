Japan confirms 20th case of mad cow disease
-------------------------------------------
Japan has confirmed its 20th case of mad cow disease in a Holstein
from northern Japan, the government said Monday [6 Jun 2005].
Experts concluded that the 4-year, 9-month-old cow from Shikaoi town
in northern Hokkaido prefecture (state) was infected with the
brain-wasting illness after analyzing samples taken earlier this
month [June 2005], the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.
"All meat, internal organs and parts from this [cow] will be
incinerated, and there is no danger that they will be circulated in
the market," the ministry statement said.
Eating beef from an infected cow is thought to cause the fatal
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or vCJD, in humans.
Japan has found 20 animals infected with the fatal illness --
formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE -- since
the country's 1st case was detected in 2001. Tokyo has since checked
every slaughtered cow before it enters the food supply.
Japan has banned American beef imports since December 2003,
immediately after the USA's 1st case of mad cow disease was
confirmed in Washington state.
Under U.S. pressure, a Japanese government panel last month [May
2005] took a step toward partially lifting the ban, but the decision
still has to be approved by the government.
In February [2005], Japan confirmed its 1st case of vCJD in a man who
died in December 2004. Japanese health authorities said they believed
the man contracted the disease during a month long visit to Britain
-- where mad cow disease 1st surfaced -- in 1989.

[As published in news media, Japan's 19th case was diagnosed last
week. It involved a 109-month-old cow raised on the northernmost
island of Hokkaido. Accordingly, the accumulated number of cases in
2005 is 6. See

European Food Safety Agency proposes increase in cattle age for removal of SRM
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The age at which specified risk materials (SRM) (tissue such as brain
and spinal cord) are removed from cattle slaughtered for food was set
at 12 months in all European Union (EU) member states (except for the
United Kingdom) in 2000. This measure was designed to protect
consumers of beef from the risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE) [1,2].
New information supplied by the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE), surveillance data and scientific research was recently
considered by members of the European Food Safety Authority
Biological Hazards Panel. Based on this evidence and a review of
previous discussions, the panel recognized that the bovine central
nervous system is unlikely to become infectious until an infected
animal is considerably older than 12 months. [3].
The average age of cattle with BSE in the EU has increased between
2001 and 2004, from 86 months to 108. Only 4 cases in cattle under 35
months have been reported since 2001. The lowest age of animals with
BSE rose from 28 to 42 months between 2001-4.
>From pathogenesis studies of infectivity distribution throughout the
incubation period, and the earliest age of clinical manifestation, it
was concluded that a bovine central nervous system would not become
infectious until at least 26 months of age, as it appears that only
during the last quarter of the incubation period does the disease
become detectable.
The panel concluded that setting the age for SRM removal at 21 months
would allow a reasonable safety margin. Based on this opinion, the
European Commission will consider whether changes to the existing
legislation should be proposed. There is currently no scientific
basis for raising the age limit for bovine tonsil and intestine.

Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards on the assessment of the
age limit in cattle for the removal of certain Specified Risk Materials (SRM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of Opinion, Question No EFSA-Q-2004-146. Adopted on 28 Apr 2005.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was invited by the European
Commission to review the previous scientific opinions (Scientific
Steering Committee, SSC) on the age limit for the removal of certain
bovine tissues as specified risk material (SRM), taking into account
a report from the referred OIE-consultation group of experts and
additional information. The assessment of the exclusion of certain
SRM at a certain age limit is based on available data of ongoing
experimental pathogenesis and dose/incubation period studies and on
knowledge of the epidemiology of BSE with respect to age at infection
and age at detection by clinical and active surveillance.
On the basis of pathogenesis studies results, it can be assumed that, in CNS,
the likely detectable PrPSc [prion protein respinsible for BSE], and
consequently the likely detectable infectivity, appears at about 3/4 of the
incubation time. Based on the earliest clinical manifestation seen in
pathogenesis studies and assuming that the last quarter of the incubation
period would be positive for infectivity, the earliest infectivity would have
to be assumed at 26 months. However, this would reflect uptake of the BSE
agent via the gut only. Other modes of prion uptake, e.g. via the oral mucosa
and neural spread, cannot be completely excluded and theoretically might
significantly shorten the incubation time. However, there are no observational
data at present to support this. As for tonsil and intestine, there is no
scientific basis to raise the age limit for their removal.
>From the analysis of the epidemiological data, it is observed that
the average age of BSE positive cases reported in the EU has been
increasing from 86 to 108 months over the period 2001-2004, most
likely due to effective control measures. It is further observed that
the number of BSE cases reported at an age less than 35 months in
past years in the EU has been only 4 out of a total number of 6520
BSE cases on a total of close to 41 million animals tested. The
minimum age of BSE cases in the EU has been 28 and 29 months (2
animals) in 2001, 32 and 34 months in 2002, 36 months in 2003 and 42
months in 2004. The 3 youngest animals were emergency slaughter,
whereas the remainder of BSE cases in young animals (i.e. younger
then 48 months, table 1) included all target groups.
If the cautious approach of the former SSC is followed and the
minimum age is taken as the denominator for the age at which SRM are
to be removed, then a cut-off at 30 months would not cover such young
animals if assuming 3/4 of the incubation period for the appearance
of infectivity in CNS. A cut-off at 21 months would cover the last
quarter of incubation time of even the single youngest animal
observed since the start of the EU surveillance in 2001.
If the BSE cases in very young animals are not taken into account and
the mean age at which BSE is detected in the field is taken as the
denominator, then a cut-off at 30 months would represent a
considerable but not an absolute safety margin with respect to
detectable BSE infectivity.
Present BSE surveillance appears to be equally effective in the EU
member states. Nevertheless, there could be important differences
between EU Member States according to differences in culling rates
and other factors like stage in the epidemic.

[The most significant factor which deserves to be taken into account
when considering the age limit for the human consumption of SRM is
the pace and rate of the feed ban implementation; in other words --
the time span elapsed since the actual, final withdrawal of ruminant
Meat and bone meal (MBM) from cattle feed, and indeed -- in view of
potential cross contamination -- also from the feed of other food
animals. It seems that effective, full implementation had not taken
place in the EU, as a whole, prior to the end of 2002. As stated in
the report, breaches have been encountered even later. This delay
deserves to be seen as a significant factor in the preference of
EFSA'a Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards to choose and recommend
a SRM age limit of 21 rather than 30 months. Other "GBR III" countries,
such as Canada, have opted to apply a 30-months-age SRM limit.
The full opinion of the Panel (7 pages) can be seen at
<http://www.efsa.eu.int/science/biohaz/biohaz_opinions/938/biohaz_opinion_ej220
_srmremove_en1.pdf>.
The EU has completed, since 2000, the assessment of the geographical
BSE-risk (GBR) of 66 countries. 3 assessments have been carried out
during 2005, relating to Costa Rica, El Salvador and Nicaragua, all 3
obtaining the status of GBR II ("Presence of one or more cattle
clinically or pre-clinically infected with the BSE agent is unlikely
but not excluded"). 7 other GBR assessments have been issued by EFSA
in September 2004, relating to Canada, USA, Mexico, South Africa,
Australia, Sweden and Norway. The reports can be accessed at
