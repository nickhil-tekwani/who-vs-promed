A major international newswire is reporting today that the Somalian
capital, Mogadishu, is becoming overrun with cholera cases, and that the
disease has spread to other parts of the country. Last week in Mogadishu
there were 60 deaths, 19 of which were at the only hospital that has a
operational quarantine. However, the hospital director, Dr. Abdirizak
Hassan Ali, said the facility cannot cope any longer with a cholera case
load of over 600 cases and more patients trying to get in, a growing
shortage of medical supplies with only partial replenishment by the
International Red Cross, and no fuel for generating electricity. The death
rate, said Dr. Osman Mohamud Dufle of the Joint Health Authority, exceeds
20 per cent.
According to Dr. Dufle, the health authority has no resources to use in
distributing the 500 cartons of drugs and rehydration solutions contributed
by the European Union. An appeal is being made for the return of
international aid agencies to the capital city where, in the words of Drs.
Ali and Dufle, the security situation is "relatively okay."

[Cholera has been waxing and waning in Somalia for some time (see earlier
postings cited above). It would be of interest to know whether the
underlying problems of sanitation and education of the public about hygiene
have been addressed in any manner. - Mod.ES
