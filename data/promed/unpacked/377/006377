Australia's quarterly animal health newsletter (Animal Health Surveillance
Quarterly) is available at the 'Animal Health in Australia' website at:
<http://www.brs.gov.au/aphb/aha>
This website summarises information form Australia's National Animal Health
Information System (NAHIS). NAHIS is managed as a key program of the
Australian Animal Health Council Ltd (AAHC), a partnership of the
Commonwealth Government, State/Territory governments, and industry. The
purpose of NAHIS is to provide timely and accurate summary information on
Australia's animal health status and on disease surveillance and control
activities, to support trade in animal commodities and to meet Australia's
international reporting obligations.
NAHIS contains information on a wide range of animal diseases. The system
is based on quarterly reporting of data on selected diseases using a range
of data sources. For the target diseases, reporting agencies provide data
according to agreed specified criteria. Three main types of information are
collected, depending on the disease: the results of laboratory testing;
outbreak investigations; and control activities. In addition to specific
disease findings, NAHIS contains a range of background material. This
includes summary descriptive information on animal diseases and their
control in Australia, livestock numbers, slaughter statistics, residue
surveillance data, animal health regulations, exotic disease contingency
plans, and key animal health contacts.
NAHIS information including maps, graphs and tables is available by
anonymous remote access through the NAHIS WWW site * Animal Health in
Australia <http://www.brs.gov.au/aphb/aha>
This site also has links to a number of Australian and overseas websites on
animal health.

National database on TSE surveillance -
<http://www.brs.gov.au/aphb/ntsesp>. This is the authoritative web site for
information on Australia's surveillance for BSE and scrapie. Some agencies
update information regularly, while some only once a quarter, so there are
times when the numbers are not fully up-to-date.
