The latest foot-and-mouth (FMD) crisis has been handled well so far,
says Sean Rickard in the Financial Times.
In 2001, it took the Government's Cobra emergency committee a month
to get involved; this time it swung into action immediately. It took
just 3 hours on Friday [3 Aug 2007] to ban national movement of
animals; last time it took 3 days.
If it turns out that FMD has spread beyond the farm in Surrey, "I
hope we will see evidence of other lessons being learnt." Two factors
from 2001 continue to loom large: the image of a countryside closed
to the public and littered with pyres of animals, and the enormous
cost now put at some GBP 9 billion [USD 18.1 billion]. About half of
that was incurred by nonagricultural rural businesses, yet because
they lacked a powerful lobby group such as the NFU, they received
almost no compensation. "Yet non-farming rural businesses employ more
people than farming and can more fairly claim to be the backbone of
the rural economy."
Indeed, says Johann Hari in the Independent. The British beef export
market brings in GBP 700 million [USD 1.4 billion] a year and employs
fewer than 40 000 people, while tourism brings in more than GBP 70
billion [USD 140.8 billion] and employs nearly 2 million. The answer
is easy: vaccinate all hoofed animals at birth. It costs almost
nothing, and no animals get sick or die. The only drawback is that we
wouldn't be able to export our beef. We are getting there, says
Magnus Linklater in the Times. Few can "stomach a repeat of the
nightmare of 2001." The battle for the vaccine hasn't been won, but
the case is starting to look "unassailable." In 2001, it was stated
there were no tests to distinguish a vaccinated animal from a
diseased one; so vaccination would mask the extent of the epidemic,
and carriers could spread the virus unchecked. There are now accepted
tests, quick and easy to carry out, that reveal the difference. Other
advances include "farm-gate" tests, which allow a vet to determine on
the spot whether a herd of cattle or flock of sheep has been
infected. Faster diagnosis means more efficient vaccination.
It shouldn't be an issue, says Peter Melchett in the Guardian.
Vaccines against serious diseases are used in farming all over the
world, including organic farming, and we all routinely consume food
from vaccinated animals.
We should make it clear to Gordon Brown that we will happily eat
products of animals vaccinated against FMD to avoid a repeat of 2001.
It's the farmers who stand in the way because of fears that
vaccinated meat will be less profitable, says Alice Miles in The
Times. And so the taxpayer carries the risk, as we always do. The
estimated bill for this outbreak is already GBP 500 million [over USD
one billion]. This time, it seems it is the Government's fault, and
the case for compensation is clear, but it is still disturbing to
learn that no more farmers are insured against FMD today than in
2001. Farmers insure property and equipment and take out liability
insurance in case they make anybody sick, but they don't insure
against disease in crops or animals. Why not?
Because the economics of farming mean it isn't worth it, says Tim
Price of NFU Mutual. "So here is an industry economically incapable
of insuring against predictable risks." We should be debating how
farmers can make a living from farming. And instead of "railing"
about how everybody has got it in for them, farmers should be
"directly challenging consumers more about what they are prepared to
pay, and for what."

Farmers were warned yesterday [12 Aug 2007] they will have to wait
until the end of the week before the all clear can be sounded on the
foot and mouth [FMD] outbreak.
The leading microbiologist, Prof Hugh Pennington, said the meat and
livestock industry could only be considered free from the risk of
further disease once the incubation period -- up to 14 days -- is
over.
His comments came the day after the Government confirmed that FMD
tests on cattle from Surrey had come back negative, raising hopes
that the disease may have been restricted to animals from 2 farmers.
Asked whether the outbreak was now over, Prof Pennington said: "I
wouldn't want to do that until, certainly, the end of this possible
incubation period. I think by the end of next week, if we've seen no
more cases, I think we can say it's highly, highly, highly, highly
unlikely that there will be any more cases, not before then."
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said
no further suspected cases of the disease had been reported today [13
Aug 2007] but also urged caution.
"Science and previous experience tell us that we have a considerable
way to go before we know we're out of the woods, and there's a need
for relentless vigilance," said a spokesman.
"This is still day 9 of the current outbreak, and the effort to
eradicate the disease remains our priority."
The 1st outbreak was confirmed on cattle belonging to Roger Pride in
fields in Normandy near Guildford, Surrey on 3 Aug 2007, prompting
Defra to impose a 3-km "protection zone" and a 10-km "surveillance
zone."
A nationwide ban on the movements of all sheep, cattle and pigs was
put in place, and the affected animals were culled the following day.
The 2nd outbreak was confirmed on 6 Aug 2007 in cattle owned by John
Gunner within the exclusion zone in the village of Normandy.
On 8 Aug 2007, Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds said the
movement of animals directly between farms and slaughterhouses would
be permitted under license, but the ban on all other movements of
susceptible animals remained in force.
Livestock culled on a 3rd farm -- John Emerson's at Hunts Hill in
Normandy -- within the protection area were found not to have FMD.
Dr Reynolds earlier told BBC News 24: "We have had to cull just over
500 animals on 2 infected premises and 3 other premises. It's early
days, but so far, our evaluation is that the risk of spread outside
the zone in Surrey is low."
An interim epidemiology report into the outbreak has concluded that
it was very likely that the source of infection was the Pirbright
research complex, which is shared by the Government-funded Institute
for Animal Health (IAH) and pharmaceutical company Merial Animal
Health. The Health and Safety Executive is expected to publish a
further report this week.
Defra has said that farmers who lost cattle to FMD will be
compensated at the market rate and will also have the clean-up costs
refunded.
The National Farmers' Union has appointed a law firm to help its
members pursue legal actions.
The local MP, Humfrey Malins, said yesterday [12 Aug 2007] that he
would help farmers whose livelihoods were under threat.
"They have gone through hell and back in the last 10 days. Whoever
their claim is against, be it the Government or other organization,
they will have my total support," he said.
Mr Malins said the farming community was daring to hope the worst may
now be over.
"The mood in Normandy and Pirbright is one of cautious optimism.
There is still grave concern, but every day that goes by without
further outbreak is a good day."

[On top of their commendable swift response, effectively putting into
operation the prepared contingency plans, the UK veterinary services
have enjoyed some tiny support from good old Fortuna. According to
the Descriptive Epidemiology of the outbreak (see 20070810.2610),
when Defra vets were called to investigate the 1st suspected farm
(IP1), the oldest FMD lesion they discovered was 9 days; 30 out of 38
animals in the affected batch had 6-8 day lesions. This means that
the virus was circulating on the farm for at least 2 weeks before FMD
was recognized and quarantine steps taken. Luckily, the incident
involved a small, family run beef finishing enterprise not engaged in
the supply of animals for fattening or breeding in other farms, or --
even worse -- in export markets. The scenario could have been much
more complex if it had been a sheep or pig breeder.
Follow-up report No. 1 of the UK outbreak, submitted to the OIE on 13
Aug 2007, is available at
