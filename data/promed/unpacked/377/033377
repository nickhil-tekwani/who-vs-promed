A man who drank raw milk produced at a Western Massachusetts dairy farm is suspected of being infected with brucellosis, state officials said today, 20 Jan 2012, raising concerns about the emergence of a germ that has not been seen in livestock here in at least 2 decades. Brucellosis is an infectious disease passed primarily between animals, but it can be acquired by humans through the consumption of raw milk.

Officials from the state Department of Public Health said they are investigating Twin Rivers Farm in Ashley Falls as the possible source of the infection, because the infected man purchased raw milk there. The dairy sells raw milk only at the facility, not in retail stores, and officials urged anyone who bought raw milk there to discard it. The owners of Twin Rivers Farm could not be reached for comment. Raw milk is not pasteurized, a process that heats food to kill bacteria. Health officials stressed that pasteurized milk is safe to drink.

Dr Alfred DeMaria, the state's top disease tracker, said the infected man, who was not identified because of patient confidentiality rules, is believed to have consumed the milk in late December 2011. But because the illness often starts with flu-like symptoms, it was difficult to pinpoint at first. "It can percolate along with fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and with nonspecific symptoms, and can be very difficult to diagnose," DeMaria said. "It's an astute physician that worked it out," he said, and alerted public health officials last night.

The man is recovering and is at home, DeMaria said, and there have been no other reported human infections. Preliminary tests to confirm the infection are expected back next week. State agriculture officials have worked hard over the past half century to reduce brucellosis infections in livestock. Dr Eugene White, an associate professor at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, said the disease is not widely contagious among farm animals, but in areas of the world where it is common, such as South America, it can significantly hamper a herd's ability to reproduce. "In regions of world that have this commonly, 10 to 25 per cent of cows will abort," he said.

Dr Catherine Brown, the state's public health veterinarian, said the germ is not typically found in the USA, and particularly not in New England. "We have not seen the bacteria identified in a Massachusetts animal in decades," Brown said. If the infection is confirmed, it will have "significant implications" for Massachusetts livestock, she said. "We will have to figure out how the organism got here, if other livestock was exposed ,and if others are at risk," she said.

William Gillmeister of the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources said his agency has inspected Twin Rivers Farm and found it to be a well-run business with no history of problems. He said investigators are still trying to determine the source of the infection and are not certain that it is in the farm's raw milk, but the milk sales have been discontinued. Gillmeister said farms must obtain a permit from his department to sell raw milk. "We regularly test the milk to make sure it is safe," he said.

The department and health officials are advising consumers who have purchased raw milk from Twin Rivers Farm to discard it, and anyone who believes they became ill from drinking raw milk should immediately seek medical attention and notify the local board of health or the state's Food Protection Program, at 617-983-6712.

[It is not clearly stated that the milk was of bovine origin but the comments in the posting suggest that this is the case and that the isolate may be _Brucella abortus_, instead of _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_. However, it appears that additional testing is pending. It is also not stated if, at this point, the diagnosis has been suspected by the use of serological testing of the patient or if brucellae have been isolated from the patient's blood cultures. The organism is fastidious and can be a slow grower on primary growth from the blood.

Campaigns to eradicate _B. abortus_ from cattle in the USA began in 1934 and have been quite successful. A year ago, commenting on a cluster of _B. abortus_ in cattle in Starr County, Texas http://www.tahc.state.tx.us/news/pr/2011/2011Feb_BrucellosisInStarrCounty.pdf it was stated that "Currently, the only known reservoir for bovine brucellosis is in elk and bison and is in the US Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) located in parts of Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming." ProMED-mail has posted on bovine _B. abortus_ infection in this area in recent years (see "see also").

Once again, the specter of human infection acquired from unpasteurized milk or other dairy product has raised its head. Among the illness linked to raw milk include zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, Coxiella burnetii, and _E. coli_ O157:H7. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ species, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A.

Other diseases that can be related to unpasteurized milk are highlighted in these paragraphs extracted from Leedom JM. Milk and infectious diseases in humans. Clin Infect Dis 2006;43: 610-615 with the citations renumbered to be consecutive starting from 1:

"In 1996 and 1998, there were 2 episodes involving rabid cows that occurred in Massachusetts (1). Milk from rabid cows can contain rabies virus, and transmission via unpasteurized milk is theoretically possible. Temperatures reached during pasteurization kill the virus. 80 persons consumed unpasteurized milk that was collected from the 2 cows, and 9 more had contact with saliva from the cows. All 89 persons received postexposure rabies prophylaxis, and no human cases of rabies eventuated. A similar report in Oklahoma of possible rabies exposure associated with the consumption of raw milk or cream from a rabid cow was circulated in 2006 (2). Tickborne encephalitis, a zoonotic arbovirus infection usually transmitted to humans by the bite of an _Ixodes persulcutus_ or _Ixodes ricinis_ tick, is endemic to Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and Russia (3). However, the virus can be found in the milk of cows and goats with tickborne encephalitis and was reported to be transmissible to humans by the consumption of unpasteurized milk (4). A case-control study failed to confirm oral transmission (5). A diarrhea syndrome (later named Brainerd diarrhea) occurred among 122 residents of Brainerd, Minnesota, during the period Dec 1983-Jul 1984 (6). It was characterized by acute onset, marked urgency, lack of systemic symptoms, failure to respond to conventional antimicrobial agents, and a long median duration of illness (median duration, 16.5 months). The syndrome was linked to consumption of raw milk from a single dairy (6). No etiologic agent was ever isolated. The outbreak of Brainerd diarrhea stopped when all of the dairy's output was diverted and pasteurized (6, MT Osterholm, personal communication). Subsequent outbreaks in Illinois and Texas were not directly associated with milk, although cattle had been in the vicinity of an Illinois well that had its water implicated as a vehicle of transmission (7). Another outbreak of Brainerd-like diarrhea, although not associated with raw milk, affected 58 (15 percent) of 394 passengers aboard a cruise ship visiting the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (8).

The following is obtained from moderator commentis regarding _B. abortus_ in bovines (Brucellosis, bison - Canada: (AB) Archive Number: 20110730.2294):

"Brucellosis, in cattle, water buffalo, and bison is caused almost exclusively by _Brucella abortus_; however, _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_ are occasionally implicated in some cattle herds. _B. suis_ does not appear to be contagious from cow to cow. Infection spreads rapidly and causes many abortions in unvaccinated cattle. In a herd in which the disease is endemic, an infected cow typically aborts only once after exposure; subsequent gestations and lactations appear normal. After exposure, cattle become bacteremic for a short period and develop agglutinins and other antibodies; some resist infection and a small percentage of infected cows recover. A positive serum agglutination test usually precedes an abortion or a normal parturition but may be delayed in about 15 per cent of cows. The incubation period may be variable and is inversely related to stage of gestation at time of exposure. Organisms are shed in milk and uterine discharges, and the cow may become temporarily infertile. Bacteria may be found in the uterus during pregnancy, uterine involution, and infrequently, for a prolonged time, in the non-gravid uterus. Shedding from the vagina largely disappears with the decrease of fluids following parturition. Some infected cows that previously aborted shed brucellae from the uterus at subsequent normal parturitions. Organisms are shed in milk for a variable length of time -- in most cattle for life.

Natural transmission occurs by ingestion of organisms, which are present in large numbers in aborted fetuses, fetal membranes, and uterine discharges. Cattle may ingest contaminated feed and water, or lick contaminated genitals of other animals. Venereal transmission by infected bulls to susceptible cows appears to be rare. Transmission may occur by artificial insemination when brucella-contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but, reportedly, not when deposited in the mid-cervix. Brucellae may enter the body through mucous membranes, conjunctivae, wounds, or intact skin.

Brucellae have been recovered from fetuses and from manure that has remained in a cool environment for more than 2 months. Exposure to direct sunlight kills the organisms within a few hours.

Because organisms are shed in the milk, unpasteurized milk, and cheese represent a human health concern. Many individuals believe drinking unpasteurized milk is better for their health. Diseases that are not killed by pasteurization represent a risk to the consumer. Brucellosis in humans causes malaise, fever, chills, sweats, headache, neck pain, low back pain, joint pain, muscle pain, occasionally diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, weakness, irritability, insomnia, and depression. Brucellosis has been called undulating fever because of its habit of producing fever and signs that wax and wane over an extended period of time.
