A deadly cluster of bacterial meningitis has erupted among HIV positive gay men in New York City. It's left one person dead in the last month and another in a critical condition, according to the Associated Press. The city's health department on Thursday [27 Sep 2012] issued an alert for "gay men and men who have sex with men."

The outbreak includes a dozen cases in the last 2 years, but it seems to have accelerated with 4 cases in the last 4 weeks. Of the 12 total cases, 4 died. All 4 of the men -- between the ages of 31 and 42 -- who contracted the disease are HIV positive, which the department says put them at a much greater risk than the general population.

Investigators are trying to find out how the outbreak has managed to spread. People with whom the men were in close contact have been treated with antibiotics.

Bacterial meningitis can cause swelling of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The disease is rare, but people with HIV-weakened immune systems are more susceptible to infection.

The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Press Release
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Health Department is currently investigating a cluster of invasive meningococcal disease, commonly known as meningitis, among gay men and men who have sex with men. Invasive meningococcal disease is a severe bacterial infection that has a high fatality rate. Within the past 4 weeks, there have been 4 cases; one died and one person is in critical care. The cases are spread across several boroughs and among men ages 31 to 42 years old.

The most recent 4 cases have all been among HIV-infected men. People living with HIV are at a greater risk than the general population of acquiring invasive meningococcal disease and if infected, dying from the infection. This disease is spread by prolonged close contact with nose or throat discharges from an infected person. Examples of prolonged contact include living in the same household or intimate activities, including kissing and sexual contact.

Common symptoms of meningitis are high fever, headache, stiff neck and rash that develop rapidly within 2 days. People that have been in prolonged close contact with infected people need to see their health care provider immediately to receive preventive antibiotics. Symptoms may occur 2 to 10 days after exposure, but usually within 5 days. People who experience symptoms should seek medical care immediately.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and sepsis), is transmitted from person to person via droplets of respiratory secretions mostly from asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers of the microorganism. It is estimated that between 10 to 25 per cent of the population carry _N. meningitidis_ at any given time, and the carriage rate may be much higher in epidemic situations. Close and prolonged contact (such as kissing, sneezing and coughing on someone), living in close quarters or dormitories (military recruits, students), sharing eating or drinking utensils, etc. facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period for meningococcal meningitis is 4 days, ranging between 2 and 10 days (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). Invasive meningococcal disease carries a high mortality rate if untreated. Even with early and appropriate treatment, patients can die within 24-48 hours.

At least 13 serogroups, based on polysaccharide capsular antigens, have been described: 5 serogroups (A, B, C, Y, & W-135) most commonly cause human disease. Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the Hypervirulent Lineages of Neisseria meningitidis, the ST-8 and ST-11 Complexes, by Using Monoclonal Antibodies Specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003 August; 41(8): 3873-3876; Available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/). However, less virulent have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immune-compromised HIV-infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis 2011;15 (2); Available at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

We are not told in the news reports above if there is any link among the 12 cases, other than they were men who have sex with men. The health department news release above only concerns the 4 most recent cases that are also HIV infected. We are not told the serotypes of the organisms involved in this outbreak in New York City; nor, if the serotype were the same, whether the isolates have the same genotype.

We are also not told the CD4 counts in the patients who have HIV co-infection. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing invasive meningococcal disease (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial Meningitis in HIV-1-Infected Patients in the Era of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009 Aug 15;51(5):582-7).

Chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone, is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for acquiring meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total population (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm). Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.
