Week-old speculation about frozen corn being responsible for a 3-year listeriosis outbreak in Europe, which has had an 18.75 per cent fatality rate, is probably correct. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) jointly published a rapid outbreak assessment today [Thu 22 Mar 2018] that says frozen corn is the "likely source of an outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_" involving Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom since 2015.

The 5 European Union (EU) countries have reported 32 confirmed listeriosis cases with 6 deaths between December 2015 and 8 March 2018, according to the EFSA-ECDC assessment. Whole genome sequencing was used to define the multi-country outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ serogroup IVb multi-locus sequence type [ST] 6. Investigators also used it to identify the implicated food source.

Other current listeriosis outbreaks in Australia, South Africa, and Europe are not related events.

Investigations point toward frozen corn packed in Poland and processed and produced in Hungary. The report recommends further investigation to identify the exact point of contamination in the food chain. Food business operators in Poland, Finland, Sweden and Estonia have withdrawn and recalled the implicated products. These measures are likely to reduce the risk of human infections in these countries.

However, new cases may be identified due to the long incubation period of listeriosis, which is up to 70 days, the long shelf-life of frozen corn, and the possible future consumption of frozen corn bought before the recall was implemented. To reduce the risk of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection from frozen corn, consumers should adequately heat frozen vegetables to kill pathogens. This applies especially to consumers at the highest risk of contracting listeriosis -- such as the elderly, pregnant women, newborns, and adults with weakened immune systems.

Coordination across the EU is crucial when there are multi-country foodborne outbreaks. One aspect of this coordination is the production of a rapid outbreak assessment (ROA) by EFSA and ECDC in close cooperation with affected countries. The ROA gives an overview of the situation in terms of public health and identifies the cause of the infections. It also includes trace-back and trace-forward investigations to identify the origin of the outbreak and where contaminated products have been distributed. These help to identify measures that will prevent further spread of the outbreak.

Multi-country outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6, infections probably linked to frozen corn -- joint ECDC-EFSA rapid outbreak assessment
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
----------
An outbreak of invasive _Listeria monocytogenes_ (_L. monocytogenes_) infections defined by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and probably linked to frozen corn has been ongoing in five European Union member states (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) since 2015. As of 8 March 2018, 32 cases have been reported and 6 patients have died due to or with the infection.

WGS analysis of 6 non-human _L. monocytogenes_ isolates detected from 2016 to January 2018 in Austria, Finland, France and Sweden found these isolates closely related to the multi-country cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ serogroup IVb, multi-locus sequence type 6 (ST6). The non-human isolates were detected in 2 different samples from mixed frozen vegetables; 3 samples from frozen corn, and one sample from a surface where various vegetables could have been processed. The only common food item in all non-human samples was corn.

The WGS analysis provides a strong microbiological link between the human and the non-human isolates and is suggestive of a potential contaminated food source related to frozen corn persisting in the food chain at least since 2016. Traceability information for the 3 frozen corn samples pointed to frozen corn products packed in Poland and processed/produced in Hungary. Two additional non-human strains isolated in Austria from frozen vegetable mixes with corn as an ingredient were traced back to the same common origin in Hungary. Further investigations are needed to verify the point of contamination in the food chain.

Consumption of frozen corn has been confirmed by 2 patients, one in Finland and one in Sweden. In addition, a Danish patient reported consumption of mixed frozen vegetables, which could have included corn. The Finnish patient confirmed consumption of frozen corn of one suspected brand, supporting an epidemiological link between the outbreak cases and frozen corn. However, no traceability and microbiological information was available for the corn consumed by the Finnish and the Swedish patients.

Food business operators in Estonia, Finland, Poland and Sweden have withdrawn and recalled the implicated frozen corn products from the market. These measures are likely to significantly reduce the risk of human infections in these countries. However, new invasive listeriosis cases may be identified due to the long incubation period (1-70 days), long shelf-lives of frozen corn products and potential consumption of frozen corn bought by the customers before the recalls and eaten without being properly cooked. Furthermore, until the root source of contamination is established and control measures implemented, new cases may occur.

[A total of 32 confirmed listeriosis cases, including 6 deaths, between December 2015 and March 8 2018, in a multi-country outbreak in 5 EU member states (Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have been linked by whole genome sequencing (genotyping) of clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, to isolates of the organism from frozen corn that was packed in Poland and processed/produced in Hungary. Although the corn has been recalled in some EU states, more cases are expected due to the long incubation period (1-70 days), long shelf-lives of frozen corn products, and potential consumption of frozen corn bought by the customers before the recalls and eaten without being properly cooked.

The means by which the frozen corn in the EU outbreak was contaminated is yet to be determined. _L. monocytogenes_ widely distributed in the environment where it can form biofilms, which enables them to attach to solid surfaces and become extremely difficult to remove. It is found in the intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans, and is found in soil and water, especially in regions in close proximity to cattle farms, indicating that these animals may contribute to its dispersal in the environment through their fecal matter. The organism can be also found in agricultural land fertilized with sewage, and in silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw milk, soft cheeses, and kitchen premises, as well as in birds, crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects.

Serotyping of _L. monocytogenes_ strains, based on variations in the somatic (O) and flagellar (H) antigens, has determined that only 3 (1/2a, 1/2b, and 4b) of the 12 serotypes of _L. monocytogenes_ cause 95 per cent of human cases; serotype 4b is most commonly associated with outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/pdf/listeriainitiativeoverview_508.pdf).
