[Baitadi District, with a population of 250 898 residents in 2011, is one of the 77 districts of Nepal, in the western region on the border with India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baitadi_District). Dogadakedar is a rural municipality, with a population of almost 25 000, in Baitadi District (https://www.citypopulation.de/php/nepal-mun-admin.php?adm2id=7403). The patient was taken from Dogadakedar to a hospital in Dhangadhi, 217 km (6.5 hours) to the south, and died on her way from Dhangadhi to a hospital in Kohalpur, another 141 km (2 1/4 hours) to the east. A map of these locations can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Kohalpur,+Nepal/dogadakedar+Rural+municipality,+Shreekot,+Nepal.

The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to the infected chiggers, but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for Gig antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions.

The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in this patient is not stated. - Mod.ML
