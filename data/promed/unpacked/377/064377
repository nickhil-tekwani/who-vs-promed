The Feathers Hotel, a historic building in Ludlow, Shropshire, has voluntarily closed to the public on advice of health bosses. A hotel guest has died after contracting legionnaires' disease and another fell ill following a stay at the same place, it has been revealed.

Tests showed links between _Legionella_ bacteria found in water samples from the hotel and the 2 guests, Public Health England said. Both guests were from Merseyside. The 1st case, a woman in her 70s, recovered after being diagnosed in April [2017].

"Sadly, the most recently diagnosed individual, who stayed at the hotel in July [2017], has died," a statement said. The deceased was a woman in her 60s. She is understood to have died in mid-August [2017].

The hotel is writing to guests who stayed at the hotel in the past 2 weeks to advise them to make contact if they have experienced any symptoms of the disease after potentially fatal _Legionella_ bacteria was in water samples taken from the site.

Dr David Kirrage, consultant with PHE West Midlands Health Protection Team, said as soon as the _Legionella_ bacterium was identified, the hotel's affected rooms were closed, the water system disinfected and heating contractors employed to look at the boilers and pipework.

[At] the time of the April [2017] case, water testing at the hotel took place and 2 tests came back positive. An improvement notice was issued and the hotel carried out the improvement work. Subsequent tests were negative suggesting that the problem was intermittent. "However, results from PHE laboratories on [Mon 11 Sep 2017] confirmed that the strain of _Legionella_ located in the hotel is indistinguishable from the samples taken from the 2 cases.

"Extensive work is now needed to overhaul and treat the plumbing in such an old building, so that guests can fully enjoy the facilities." The hotel will remain closed while the work is carried out.

_Legionella_ bacteria are commonly found in sources of water, such as rivers and lakes, which sometimes find their way into artificial water supply systems. NHS [National Health Service] advice is that large buildings such as hotels, hospitals, and office blocks are more vulnerable to _Legionella_ contamination because they have larger, more complex water supply systems and the bacteria can quickly spread. Legionnaires' disease is 3 times more common in men than women and mostly affects people aged over 50. An estimated 10 percent of people who contract the disease will die from complications arising from infection.

[Clusters of legionnaires' disease associated with travel are difficult to detect if a travel history is not sought because the travelers typically disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.

The news article above reports 2 cases, one fatal, which occurred among guests at an historic hotel. The 1st case was diagnosed in April 2017 and the 2nd case, who was reported to have stayed at the hotel in July 2017, died in mid-August 2017. The cases are said to be linked by unspecified "tests", perhaps genotyping, and that the strain of _Legionella_ located in the hotel's water system is "indistinguishable from the samples taken from the 2 cases." In April 2017 after the 1st case, the hotel's water system was remediated and _Legionella_ cultures were subsequently negative, but cultures again were positive for this organism. The hotel is now closed for remediation.
