According to Iranian television, 3 cases of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD),
the epidemic provoking livestock quarantines across Britain and Europe,
have been identified in Iran for the first time.
The disease was diagnosed in 3 sheep in the mountainous Sharud region
north-west of Teheran, said the head of Iran's veterinary organisation,
Akbar Motalebi. Mr Motalebi discounted the chances of an epidemic in Iran.
FMD "has existed in the past in certain areas of Iran due to the smuggling
of cattle into the country," he said. He added the malady is treatable with
a vaccine.
