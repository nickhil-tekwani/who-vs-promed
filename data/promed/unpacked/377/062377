7 cases of _P. falciparum_ malaria ex Dominican Republic
--------------------------------------------------------
Since 18 Nov 2004, TropNetEurop has received an increasing number of reports
about travelers with falciparum malaria from the east coast of the Dominican
Republic (all from Punta Cana).
As of 27 Nov 2004, 7 patients have been reported, with 2 being treated at an
ICU for complicated malaria. This is a strong indicator for a localised
outbreak in that area. We recommend further local investigation. Until
further notice, we have adapted our pre-travel counseling and are
recommending malaria chemoprophylaxis for [travelers visiting] the east
coast of the Dominican Republic.
All reported patients:
25 Nov 2004, reported from Cologne, Germany
A female patient with a double infection (_P. falciparum/P. vivax_) after a
holiday in the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana with one day in Saona).
----------------------------------------
25 Nov 2004, reported from Madrid, Spain
Falciparum malaria (parasitemia: 4.5 percent) in a 27-year-old man who had
traveled to Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.
---------------------------------------------------
25 Nov 2004, reported from London, UK
Falciparum malaria in a holidaymaker who spent 2 weeks in Playa Bavaro,
which is north of Punta Cana on the Eastern coast of the Dominican Republic,
returning to the UK on 5 Nov 2004. He had taken no prophylaxis.
-------------------------------------------------------
23 Nov 2004, reported from Berlin, Germany
One patient was admitted for control investigation after being diagnosed
with falciparum malaria at 12 Nov 2004 in Punta Cana and treated
subsequently.
-------------------------------------------------------
21 Nov 2004, reported from Munich, Germany
A 26-year-old female returnee from the Dominican Republic with falciparum
malaria (parasitemia 6 percent). No chemoprophylaxis, symptoms for one week.
---------------------------------------------------
20 Nov 2004, from Regensburg, Germany
A 42-year-old female patient who had been in Punta Cana was admitted with
complicated falciparum malaria. 6 days elapsed until she saw her doctor and
he admitted her. Parasitemia of 12 percent.
---------------------------------------------------
18 Nov 2004 reported from Heidelberg, Germany
A _P. falciparum_ infection was diagnosed in a 25-year-old man coming back
from DR (Punta Cana ) 2 weeks ago.

[Different European centres have reported 7 patients with _P. falciparum_
malaria, all having visited Punta Cana. The cases probably indicate an
increased risk in other parts of the Dominican Republic as well as among
tourists returning from this area. The risk seems quite high, although we do
not have a denominator. In the interest of comprehensive reporting, ProMED
encourages others who have recently seen malaria patients from the Dominican
Republic to contact Dr Jelinek. - Mod.EP]
