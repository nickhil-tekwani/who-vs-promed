Deadly disease stalk villagers on Nagaland border
---------------------------------------------------------
Residents of Kuilong village under Tamei sub-division of Tamenglong
district are in a dire plight since the outbreak of a highly
infectious disease (something like malarial typhoid) which has
claimed a life since November [2007] last year and has infected
members of nearly every household in the village and its surrounding area.

The disease which started spreading in Kuilong village since November
last year [2007] has so far claimed one life while 35 patients are
seriously ill from the disease which remains a mystery to the
villagers, according to N Z Achabou, spokesperson of the All
Zeliangrong Students' Union, Assam, Manipur and Nagaland and the
president of the Village Authority Association, Tamei.

Even though doctors at the Catholic Medical Hospital, Koirengei,
believe it to be malarial typhoid from the symptoms, there has been
no confirmation of the same and besides the state authorities are yet
to investigate into the matter. Most of the seriously ill villagers
were admitted to hospital, but they left the hospital before they
fully recovered from disease due to financial problems, according to
the AZSU spokesperson.

Currently 2 patients from the village are under treatment in serious
condition, he said adding that so far 35 patients have been treated
in the hospital since the outbreak of the disease. After returning
back from hospital without recovering fully, they again fell ill due
to the same disease after reaching the village, the president of the
Village Authority Association said.

Symptoms of the disease include severe joint ache and stomach pain.

The disease first appeared in Kuilong, a village of 900 residents
last November [2007], but spread to the neighbouring villages like
Lemta, Dulong, Makuilong, etc.

He also recounted the incidents of claiming around 20 to 30 people of
Lenglong village located in the same Barak range some years back by
the malarial typhoid and urged the concerned authorities of the
Manipur government to dispatch medical teams and enquire about the
mass infection by the disease and take up measures to provide relief
to the villagers.

[It is difficult to know what the etiology of this disease might be
given the information in this article. ProMED requests further
detailed information about this illness and what the term malarial
typhoid denotes to the local health care providers there. The severe
joint pain raises the possibility of infection with chikungunya virus.
