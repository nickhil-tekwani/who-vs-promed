A total of 257 people have lost their lives due to suspected
meningococcal meningitis in Meghalaya since 2008, the state government
said on Friday. In 2008, 130 people (10 of them confirmed) died of the
disease. This year, so far, 127 (4 confirmed) people have succumbed to
the disease. However, more than 2000 cases have so far been reported
from the state, health minister Mukul Sangma told the Assembly.

"But the situation is under control and preventive measures are being
carried out," he said. Around 10 lakh [one million] doses of vaccines
from the World Health Organisation (WHO) have been procured till now
and a free vaccination campaign in 3 affected districts is being
organised by the state government. Response teams have been
constituted to identify places where the vaccination campaign would be
taken up in due course, he added.

"Extensive awareness programmes have been taken up and preventive
medicines are being distributed free," the health minister said.

[When last reported by ProMed-mail in mid-February 2009 (Meningitis,
meningococcal - India (04): (NE) 20090217.0661), there were said to
be 165 deaths in Meghalaya in just the 1st month of 2009; whereas, the
current report above says that there were only 127 deaths in Meghalaya
in all of the 1st 6 months of 2009. In mid-February 2009, the epidemic
also involved neighboring Indian states of Tripura and Mizoram, as
well as an adjacent region (Chittagong Hill Tracts) of Bangladesh.
Meningococcal serogroup A was said to be the culprit. At that time,
ProMED-mail reported that a vaccination program was underway, and from
the current report is still underway.

Meghalaya, a mountainous Indian state, is located between the
northeastern border of Bangladesh and the Indian state of Assam. A
