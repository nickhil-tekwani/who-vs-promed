[Israel becomes the 1st Middle Eastern country to join the fast-growing list of countries infected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza strain H5N8. Most likely, the virus has been introduced by migrating birds and in line with the prediction of Food and Agriculture Organisation's experts earlier this year (see 20160920.4501532). The infected site, Kibbutz Heftziba, north east Israel, is situated close to a nature reserve, within an area rich in fish ponds, as obvious in the map at http://tinyurl.com/zwhzw24. This area is visited by large numbers of migrating birds.

Heftziba is situated within 4 km [about 2.5 mi] as the crow (or the duck...) flies from the Palestinian territories and about 12 km [about 7.5 mi] from the Jordan river, which separates Israel from the Kingdom of Jordan; in both territories, enhanced alertness is similarly warranted.

It would be of interest to note if Israel maintains AI surveillance in wild birds, and to obtain experts' suggestions on the migrating routes at this point in time. Genotyping may be helpful to determine the origin of the introduced virus.

Information on the widely-applied inland aquaculture in Israel, where the many fish ponds attract migrating birds, is available at https://www.aquacultureinisrael.com/en/fishfarmers/israeli-aquaculture-overview/item/14-overview-israeli-inland-aquaculture.

HPAI H5N8, currently reported from 3 continents, has -- so far -- not been found involved in human infection (but see 20150114.3090250). A recent FAO update on H5N8 epidemiology is to be found in item 3 of ProMED-mail posting 20161110.4618279. - Mod.AS
