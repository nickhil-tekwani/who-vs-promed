Too much ado about animal disease
--------------------------------------
Is Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) really so bad? Is the panic buying in food
stores, the screaming newspaper headlines, the flaming pyres of slaughtered
animals, virtual shutting down of British agriculture, postponement of
sports events -- even possible delay of the May general election -- really
so justified?
According to a senior British veterinary expert and a Ministry of
Agriculture Fisheries and Food (MAFF) spokesman, the answer is probably
"No," at least from the animal and human health point of view.
"FMD very rarely kills the animals catching it," said Abigail Wood, a
veterinarian and researcher into the history of FMD for the Wellcome Trust
at the University of Manchester. Writing in Thursday's London Times, she
said: "The animals almost always recover, and in a couple of weeks. It
almost never gets passed on to humans and when it does it is a mild
infection only. The meat from animals that have had it is fit to eat. In
clinical terms, FMD is about as serious, to animals or to people, as a bad
cold."
"Why, then, the concern? And why the policy of wholesale slaughter?" The
answer, she said, is economics. She argues Britain is now forced to live
with a policy of slaughter it introduced for economic reasons in the
1920's, establishing standards for sanitary control on infected areas it
encouraged Europe and the rest of the world to adopt in the 1950's.
"FMD does reduce the productivity of an animal: its milk yield, its rate of
putting on flesh," wrote Abigail Wood. "There are no figures for how much
it reduces these things: part of the reason is no one since the 1920's in
Britain has seen the disease take its full course. Any animal infected with
it has been immediately slaughtered. "That reduction in productivity, fear
of small economic loss, is what lies behind the elimination policy -- and
huge economic costs are now being incurred."
The disease, she reported, first appeared in Britain in 1839, carried in
from Argentinean meat and even foreign hay, and became endemic in British
farming for much of the 19th century. Farmers lived with it as they did
with bad weather and poor harvests.
It was the owners of pedigree herds who from 1869 pressed for isolation of
infected animals to eradicate the disease, and by prohibition of live
imports. Animals only started to be slaughtered after 1900, when waves of
imported FMD prompted more drastic action. In the 1920's one outbreak
became so bad Ministry of Agriculture officials were so behind in their
slaughtering many of the diseased cows were recovered by the time the
slaughterers arrived. Farmers asking why the need for slaughter were then
asked by the ministry which policy they would prefer -- elimination or
toleration. The vote was only narrowly in favor of elimination.
"A policy of living with FMD might have worked in the 1920's, and had we
adopted it we would not be witness to the present scenes," said Ms Wood.
But that was when productivity was not all that really mattered. Today,
agri-business is global and a Britain with FMD is considered an uneconomic
meat-producing backwater.
"It is now too late to consider the option of tolerating the disease," she
said. "So the cows are slaughtered. Our past policy has forced us to this
pass."
Memories in Britain today are not of animals who recover from the disease
but of the 1967-68 outbreak, the worst in British history when hundreds of
thousands of animals were slaughtered. There is now no questioning in
government in agriculture or the media of the reasons behind the draconian
slaughterings and isolations. No newspapers or TV stations have examined
the history or clinical aspects of the disease.
Last night an agriculture ministry official conceded it was a distressing
disease, though not usually fatal, but that -- particularly after BSE --
nobody would buy British meat products unless the most drastic action was
taken to control it.

[It takes a farm 2 years to fully recover from the impact of FMD. There is
a 60% loss of embryo implantations during the outbreak, plus a 100% stop in
breeding during the 3-4 weeks as the infection works through the herd;
calves die; increased mastitis rates because of the intramammary damage by
the disease which is then followed by permanent loss of quarters; animals
with permanent foot damage; and then there will be a significant number
with damage to their thyroids. Other problems include raised body
temperatures and coat changes, easily exhausted animals, animals not
reaching peak lactation. The animals coming out of a milking shed have been
so exhausted their tongues are totally relaxed virtually dragging the
ground. They also have immune defects. In today's industry one cannot
afford the permanent damage caused to a percentage of one's herd like this.
Cows greater than 110 days pregnant were at a high risk of aborting if they
got FMD. Between successful implantation and 110 days they seemed to be
immune to the disease. The reason it takes a herd 2 years to recover is
tied to the upset to the breeding cycle and missing calves. Another
economic hit.
According to Fenner, Bachmann, Gibbs, Murphy, Studdert, and White
(Veterinary Virology 1987) FMD viruses "may persist in the pharynx of some
animals for a prolonged period after recovery. In cattle the virus may be
detectable for periods up to 2 years after exposure to infection, in sheep
for about 6 months. Viral persistence does not occur in swine."
However, others report the virus in the esophagus can last longer than 2
years, 3 to 4 is well known. During which time it is subject to genetic
drift especially as time passes. Thus when the host is stressed and the
virus re-emerged it isn't the same as when the animal first encountered the
virus. Now this "changed" virus finds a new bunch of now susceptible cattle
to infect. So, given that some proportion of herds may be asymptomatic and
some proportion of infected livestock may shed virus, there is a problem.
One of the saddest aspects of the slaughter mind-set is the impact on the
people losing their animals. This is an old disease and we live in a very
modern age of technology. No one seems to have made any progress with this
disease. With other diseases we can distinguish between disease induced
antibody titers and vaccination induced antibody titers. Why has technology
not been applied to this disease?
I am grateful to Drs. Charlie Calisher and Martin Hugh-Jones for their
assistance in understanding more about this disease and for their input
here. - Mod.TG]
