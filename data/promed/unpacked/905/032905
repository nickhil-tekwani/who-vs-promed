Children hospitalised following contact with a rabid dog
--------------------------------------------------------
A total of 22 schoolchildren in the Chernigov oblast of Ukraine were
hospitalized between 16 and 18 Feb 2011 as a consequence of contact
with a rabid dog which the children had played with in the school
playground. Sometime soon after the dog died, rabies virus infection
was was found to be the cause of the dog's death. The children who had
been in contact with the dog were immediately immunised and kept under
observation in hospital. The decision to keep the children under
observation was a consequence of the earlier death of a 46-year-old
woman from rabies in the same territory.

[The date of exposure is not stated, but the likely prompt decision
to vaccinate following diagnosis of rabies should provide the exposed
children with adequate protection.

The Chernigov region lies in the north of Ukraine, on the middle
Dnepr left bank, in the Desna basin. Chernigov oblast lies within
geographical zones of mixed forests and forest steppe. The forests
cover about 20 percent of the territory of Chernigov oblast. The
location of Chernigov oblast is displayed in the map at:
