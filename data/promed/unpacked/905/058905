[On 23 May 2012 Botswana reported 2 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the Ngamiland region [North West District]. In one serotype SAT2 was identified, and in the 2nd the serotype was not identified. See immediate notification report and follow-up report no 4 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=12034 and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14534 respectively.

The epidemiological comment in the immediate notification noted that "Ngamiland is an FMD control zone which is physically isolated from the rest of the country by disease control fences. The zone is further subdivided into 4 subzones (2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d) by internal disease control fences. Cattle residing within the zone are routinely vaccinated every 4 months using a trivalent SAT 1, 2, and 3 vaccine."

According to the final report (no 5), the outbreaks reported were resolved on 20 May 2014. 148 497 cattle were vaccinated with trivalent FMD SAT 1, 2, 3 vaccine in April/May 2014. An update and map for this event can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015224_20140520_163527.pdf.

Base on what is described above, and on historical reports from the country, the serotype that may be identified will likely be SAT2. See Botswana OIE's Annual report, sections 1 and 3 on these reports:
