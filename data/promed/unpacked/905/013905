Raw oysters linked to the deaths of 2 Chatham County women are
believed to have come from the Gulf of Mexico, officials said.
The source is still being investigated, said Coastal District Health
Director Dr. Doug Skelton. But knowing the source may not help
authorities prevent others from becoming infected, he said.
'This is not a recall product like raw spinach,' Skelton said. 'This
is just a risk people who eat raw oysters take.'
He said the oysters were purchased from a restaurant and a retailer
the Savannah area.
Skelton and Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin warned
consumers about eating raw oysters after the deaths of the 2 women,
whose names were not released.
The deaths are believed to have been caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_, a
naturally occurring marine microorganism. It is not normally a threat
to healthy people, but can cause serious illness in people whose
immune systems are impaired because of conditions such as liver
disease, AIDS, hemochromomatosis, or who are undergoing chemotherapy
or taking steroids for asthma.
On average, only 35 people contract the infection from shellfish
annually in the United States. But despite the rarity, Skelton
believes the 2 recent deaths occurring in the same place were a coincidence.
'The best we can tell, the only common thread is that the 2
individuals had seriously compromised immune systems,' he said.
The bacterium is associated with oysters raised in the Gulf of Mexico
-- the source of most raw oysters consumed in the United States --
and other warm waters. To kill dangerous microorganisms, oysters must
be cooked to 145 degrees for 15 seconds. _Vibrio vulnificus_ can
still be present if oysters are undercooked.
'I won't eat raw oysters,' Skelton said. 'If you are going to eat
oysters, they're better fried or cooked.' Restaurants that serve raw
oysters are required to post warnings for consumers. They are also
required to keep shellfish tags for 90 days. The tag's information
enables investigators to trace any bag of oysters back to the growing
area and harvester.
'When diners see a warning statement on the wall of a restaurant, on
a bag of oysters, or in a menu, they should take it seriously,' Irvin
said. 'If you think you may be at risk, consult your doctor or local
health department before consuming raw oysters.'

[From the CDC fact sheet:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/vibriovulnificus_g.htm#What%20is%20Vibrio%20vulnificus>
"_Vibrio vulnificus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that
cause cholera. It normally lives in warm seawater and is part of a
group of vibrios that are called "halophilic" because they require salt.
What type of illness does _V. vulnificus_ cause?
--------------------
_V. vulnificus_ can cause disease in those who eat contaminated
seafood or have an open wound that is exposed to seawater. Among
healthy people, ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ can cause vomiting,
diarrhea, and abdominal pain. In immunocompromised persons,
particularly those with chronic liver disease, _V. vulnificus_ can
infect the bloodstream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness
characterized by fever and chills, decreased blood pressure (septic
shock), and blistering skin lesions. _V. vulnificus_ bloodstream
infections are fatal about 50 percent of the time.
_V. vulnificus_ can also cause an infection of the skin when open
wounds are exposed to warm seawater; these infections may lead to
skin breakdown and ulceration. Persons who are immunocompromised are
at higher risk for invasion of the organism into the bloodstream and
potentially fatal complications.
How is _V. vulnificus_ infection treated?
---------------------
If _V. vulnificus_ is suspected, treatment should be initiated
immediately because antibiotics improve survival. Aggressive
attention should be given to the wound site; amputation of the
infected limb is sometimes necessary. Clinical trials for the
management of _V. vulnificus_ infection have not been conducted. The
antibiotic recommendations below come from documents published by
infectious disease experts; they are based on case reports and animal
models. Culture of wound or hemorrhagic bullae is recommended, and
all _V. vulnificus_ isolates should be forwarded to a public health laboratory
Blood cultures are recommended if the patient is febrile, has
hemorrhagic bullae, or has any signs of sepsis
Antibiotic therapy is available from the physician.
--Doxycycline and a 3rd-generation cephalosporin is generally recommended
--A single agent regimen with a fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin,
ciprofloxacin or gatifloxacin, has been reported to be at least as
effective in an animal model as combination drug regimens with
doxycycline and a cephalosporin
--Children, in whom doxycycline and fluoroquinolones are
contraindicated, can be treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
plus an aminoglycoside
Are there long-term consequences of _V. vulnificus_ infection?
-------------
_V. vulnificus_ infection is an acute illness, and those who recover
should not expect any long-term consequences.
What can be done to improve the safety of oysters?
-------------------------
Although oysters can be harvested legally only from waters free from
fecal contamination, even legally harvested oysters can be
contaminated with _V. vulnificus_ because the bacterium is naturally
present in marine environments. _V. vulnificus_ does not alter the
appearance, taste, or odor of oysters. Timely, voluntary reporting of
_V. vulnificus_ infections to CDC and to regional offices of the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) will help collaborative efforts to
improve investigation of these infections. Regional FDA specialists
with expert knowledge about shellfish assist state officials with
tracebacks of shellfish and, when notified rapidly about cases, are
able to sample harvest waters to discover possible sources of
infection and to close oyster beds when problems are identified.
Ongoing research may help us to predict environmental or other
factors that increase the chance that oysters carry pathogens."

[The recent outbreak of _V. parahaemolyticus_ from shellfish, a
usually less severe infection also primarily from oysters, reinforced
the observation that these diseases, usually linked to warm water,
can occur farther north during heat waves. To reiterate, the
presence of these organisms does not require fecally contaminated
waters. - Mod.LL]
