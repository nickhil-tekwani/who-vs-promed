Some 12 490 people have sustained tick bites in the Tyumen oblast
since the beginning of the epidemic season this year [2010],
including 59 cases during the past week.

Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Agency for Human Health and Welfare] has
announced that 345 suspected cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE),
63 of whom were children under 14 years of age, have been admitted to hospital.

As of Thu 12 Aug 2010, the number of confirmed cases of TBE was 81,
whereas during the same period last year [2009], only 45 cases were
recorded. None of the cases had been immunized against TBE virus
infection, and 26 percent of cases received emergency immune globulin
treatment.

The increase of TBE morbidity can be explained by the current
abundance of ticks as a consequence of their 3-year development
cycle. The regional laboratory which carries out surveys on ticks has
reported that this year [2010], 5.4 percent of ticks are carrying TBE
virus, and 15.2 percent are carrying _Borellia_ (the causative agent
of Lyme disease).
