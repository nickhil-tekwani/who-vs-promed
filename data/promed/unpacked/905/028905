Spring viremia of carp is the likely cause of death of 200 to 500
fish
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DNR [Department of Natural Resources] biologist believes he has
pinpointed the cause of a mass fish die-off that occurred at Kent Lake
last weekend. A new estimate of 200 to 500 carp died, likely due to a
virus called spring viremia of carp, said DNR fisheries biologist, Jim
Francis.

Francis said that conditions were favorable for the spread of the
virus, with the lake's temperature being under 65 degrees. "All of the
reports we have received are consistent with the virus," Francis
said.

Concerns that the fish had been poisoned by a water treatment or were
victims of oxygen turnover can be laid to rest since either of those
scenarios would have killed many different species indiscriminately,
Francis said.

Other area lakes have been affected by the same virus, including
Woodland Lake in Brighton.

"It's not the worst thing in the world when some carp die off,"
Francis said. "They aren't good for the ecosystem. They do harm to
lakes." Francis said. Though 500 fish sounds like a big number,
Francis said it only represents a small percentage of the population
in Kent Lake. He says the die-off is likely over now that the lake's
temperature is just above 65 degrees.

Clean-up crews at Kensington Metropark are currently hard at work
trying to clean the lake and shoreline of the dead fish carcasses,
said metropark superintendent Kimberly Jarvis. She said she
anticipates a quick clean-up.

"If the die-off is over, it will be no later than the end of the
week," Jarvis said. Many of the dead carp will be used in Kensingtons
community service garden as fertilizer. "When we can use no more they
will be disposed of appropriately," Jarvis said.

[While they believe it is spring viremia, I haven't seen a laboratory
report on necropsy findings that indicate it is spring viremia or koi
herpes virus.

Spring viremia of carp is caused by the spring viremia of carp virus
(SVCV), which is also known as Rhabdovirus carpio. This virus is a
member of the family Rhabdoviridae and has been tentatively placed in
the genus Vesiculovirus. SVCV is closely related to pike fry
rhabdovirus, and these 2 viruses cross-react in some serologic tests.

SVCV strains vary in their pathogenicity. Isolates can be divided
into 4 genetic groups. Genogroup Ia viruses originate from Asia.
Genogroups Ib and Ic are comprised of isolates from Russia, Moldova,
and Ukraine. Genogroup Id mainly contains viruses from the United
Kingdom, although a few isolates in this group are from the former
Soviet Union. SVCV strains from recent outbreaks in the United States
appear to be most closely related to genogroup Ia.

Fish can carry SVCV with or without symptoms. Fish up to a year old
are most likely to be affected, but illness also occurs in older
animals. The clinical signs are nonspecific. In carp, the most common
symptoms include abdominal distension, exophthalmia, inflammation or
edema of the vent (often with trailing mucoid fecal casts), and
petechial hemorrhages of the skin, gills and eyes. The body is often
darkened with pale gills. Diseased fish tend to gather at the water
inlet or sides of the pond, swim and breathe more slowly than normal,
and react sluggishly to stimuli. Loss of equilibrium, with resting and
leaning, are seen in the late stages. Concurrent bacterial infections
(carp-dropsy complex) or parasitic infections influence the symptoms
and mortality rate.

SVC outbreaks are most common in farmed carp, but can also occur in
wild fish. Although fish of any age can become ill, disease is most
common in young fish up to a year of age. The morbidity and mortality
rates vary with stress factors and population density, as well as the
species, age and condition of the fish. Water temperature affects the
development of disease. In Europe, susceptible species usually become
infected in the fall and winter as the water temperature falls. Some
populations may become ill then, but most outbreaks occur in the
spring as temperatures rise. Although the relationship between water
temperature and illness is complex, clinical signs are most common at
17 deg C (63 deg F) or below. Fry may become ill at temperatures as
high as 22-23 deg C (71-73 deg F).

The mortality rate is highest in young fish. Mortality rates up to 70
per cent have been reported in young carp during outbreaks. In
experimentally infected fish, the mortality rate can be as high as 90
per cent. Yearly losses in older fish are usually under 30 per cent.
Water temperatures affect the mortality rate. In experimental
infections, the cumulative mortality rate is similar at all
temperatures from 11 deg C to 17 deg C (52 to 63 deg F), but the fish
die more quickly at 17 deg C than 11-15 deg C (52-59 deg F). The
mortality rate decreases at temperatures between 17 deg C and 26 deg C
(78.8 deg F). Recovery from infection usually results in strong
immunity.

SVC should be suspected in cyprinid fish with signs of a systemic
infection and an increased mortality rate, when water temperatures are
below 20 deg C (68 deg F). A particularly high incidence of disease in
common carp, with reduced susceptibility in carp hybrids and lower
disease prevalence in other cyprinids, is also suggestive. The
clinical signs and lesions are not pathognomonic and must be confirmed
by laboratory diagnosis.

Spring viremia of carp is generally a reportable disease in most
states and should be reported the federal authorities, generally the
area veterinarian in charge (AVIC) is the one to receive the report.
