On [Tue 4 Jun 2013] the [Uruguayan] government placed under quarantine a 2nd Chinese-flagged vessel near the coast, after one of its crew presented with symptoms similar to those of 2 sailors from another ship of the same origin who died recently.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the new crew member is hospitalized in Montevideo in serious condition, but the illness that affects him is not known.

The 1st ship, with 40 people on board, entered Montevideo last week [week of 27 May 2013] with one crew member dead and another one sick, who after being treated at a local health center also died. Another sailor from that ship remains in hospital.

"Infectious diseases such as influenza, dengue, leptospirosis, and hantavirus infection have been ruled out," the national director of health, Marlene Sica, said in a press conference.

Those affected had similar symptoms with lower limb edema, respiratory problems, and heart failure.

Authorities ordered the autopsy of the 2 bodies, while tests are being carried out on the other 2 hospitalized patients. "We are now waiting for toxicology results," said Sica.

However, "one of the boats left Beijing more than a year ago," making it more difficult to determine what the crew have eaten or what they have been exposed to in order to identify the cause of illness, she said.

Uruguay has reported the cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Pan American Health Organization.

[The news report above first appeared in ProMED/ESP "Enfermedad desconocida - Uruguay (MON): muertes, cuarentena de barcos" archive no 20130606.326495. This post reports a shipboard outbreak that involved 3 members of the crew (2 of whom died) of one Chinese-flagged ship and a 4th member of the crew of another Chinese-flagged ship both quarantined in the port of Montevideo, Uruguay. All 4 developed a similar illness with lower limb edema, respiratory problems, and heart failure. No further details are given, except one of the 2 ships left Beijing over a year ago. We are not told what the ships' prior ports of call were or if the ships traveled together and had similar ports of call.

We are told that infectious diseases such as influenza, dengue, leptospirosis, and hantavirus infection have been ruled out, but we are not told how this was done. Since infectious diseases were investigated first, presumably the patients were febrile and developed acute congestive heart failure. Diagnostic possibilities include orally transmitted Chagas disease, which causes acute myocarditis (due to massive parasite transmission) after an incubation period of 5 days (http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0037-86822008000300014&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en); and enterovirus, such as EV71, or a coxsackie virus infections, which have been linked in the literature to clusters of cases of acute myocarditis that were preceded by a non-specific febrile prodrome that suggested the outbreak was viral in origin (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/10/04-1152_article.htm). Dengue (http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1756-0500-4-268.pdf) or influenza (http://bit.ly/11vxdAA) can also cause a non-specific febrile illness with acute myocarditis.

The possibility that this is not due to an infection but rather is due to a toxic exposure also exists. Acute cocaine intoxication may also cause acute congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/152535-overview#aw2aab6b6).

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources on this cluster including laboratory testing thus far, clinical and epidemiologic details of the cases -- age, sex, a detailed history of travel, food history, history of contact with other cases or animals.
