A 54 year old woman from Onethika village in the Oshikoto region was admitted to Onandjokwe Hospital after she was diagnosed with Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

A letter written by acting Oshikoto regional health director, Helena Nkandi-Shiimi states that the woman went to the hospital on [21 Apr 2019] complaining of a headache, fever, and vomiting blood after she got bitten by a tick around [18 Apr 2019].

"The patient was sent home, and again reported at the Ontananga clinic on [26 Apr 2019] with the same complaints," Nkandi-Shiimi said, adding that the patient was admitted, and tests were done on her blood, which discovered the virus.

The virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after an animal slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians.

Nkandi-Shiimi further said the patient, who is in a stable condition, is in strict isolation, and infection protocols were enforced. The patient shows no more signs or symptoms of CCHF.

"A team was sent to Onethika village to do a case investigation and tracing," she said, but none of the people she was in contact with showed any symptoms. She noted that an active case search will be done, especially in the health facilities and areas around Onethika village.

[CCHF is viral illness that occurs in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia. The principal reservoir and vector of CCHF are ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, although other tick genera can be infected with CCHF virus. The CCHF virus is transmitted to humans mainly by tick bites (70 percent of CCHF cases have a history of tick bite) or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.

88 percent of people infected will have subclinical symptoms. One in 8 people will develop a severe disease. Case fatality ratio can reach 15 percent among patients hospitalized with severe presentation.

Symptoms are non-specific; clinical diagnosis may be difficult. Differential diagnosis includes other viral haemorrhagic fevers, malaria, typhoid fever, shigellosis, and other viral and bacterial diseases which may present difficulty in absence of good laboratory services. Definitive diagnosis requires testing: reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay; IgG and IgM antibodies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); antigen detection tests; virus isolation by cell culture. Handling and processing specimen requires suitably equipped laboratories under maximum biological containment conditions and staff collecting samples should be trained in biosafety.

Patient history is essential and should include: exposure to ticks; or exposure to wild animals and livestock; and/or area/village endemic for CCHF; and/or contact with CCHF cases.

In healthcare settings, the following should be considered when handling CCHF cases:
"- implement standard precautions with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices, at all times, including safe injection practices (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/standardprecautions/en/index.html);
- healthcare workers treating patients with CCHF should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body fluids and contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/filovirus_infection_control/en);
- laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from suspected human CCHF cases for diagnosis should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories."
