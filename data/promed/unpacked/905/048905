Progress Toward Elimination of Rubella and Congenital Rubella
Syndrome -- the Americas, 2003--2008
-------------------------------------------
In 2003, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) adopted a
resolution calling for rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)
elimination in the Americas by the year 2010 (1). Elimination was
defined as the interruption of endemic rubella virus transmission in
all countries of North America, Central America, South America, and
the Caribbean for more than 12 months and no occurrence of CRS cases
attributed to endemic transmission (2). To accomplish this goal, PAHO
developed a rubella and CRS elimination strategy (3) to 1) introduce
rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) into routine vaccination programs of
all countries for children aged 12 months and reach greater than 95
percent coverage in all municipalities, 2) conduct a one-time mass
campaign among adolescents and adults and periodic follow-up
campaigns among children aged less than 5 years (4), and 3) integrate
rubella surveillance with measles surveillance and initiate CRS
surveillance. During 1998-2006, confirmed rubella cases decreased 98
percent (from 135 947 to 2998) in the Americas. However, in 2007,
rubella outbreaks with a total of 13 014 cases occurred in 3
countries (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), primarily in males not
included in previous vaccination campaigns. This report summarizes
overall progress toward reaching the 2010 goal of eliminating rubella
and CRS. With completion of campaigns in Argentina, Brazil, and
Haiti, all countries will have implemented the recommended PAHO
strategy by the end of 2008, with the expectation of reaching the
2010 rubella and CRS elimination goal.

Routine Vaccination
--------------------
All 38 countries and territories in the Americas, with the exception
of Haiti, have introduced measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) in
their routine immunization schedules. Beginning in 2009, Haiti will
introduce measles-rubella (MR) vaccine in its routine immunization
program, after completion of a one-time MR mass vaccination campaign.

In the Americas, routine MMR vaccination coverage is calculated by
countries in one of 3 ways: based on the number of doses administered
(34 countries), nominal registries (Mexico and Uruguay), and coverage
surveys (Canada and the United States). Reported regional routine 1st
dose MMR (MMR1) coverage at age 12 months was 93-94 percent during
2003-2007. In 2007, MMR1 coverage of greater than 95 percent was
reported in 19 (51 percent) countries, 90-94 percent in 7 (19
percent) countries, 80-89 percent in 7 (19 percent) countries, and
less than 80 percent in 4 (11 percent) countries. In 2007, of the 20
countries and territories reporting administration of a 2nd routine
MMR dose (MMR2), reported coverage was greater than 95 percent in 3
(15 percent) countries, 90-94 percent in 3 (15 percent) countries,
80-89 percent in 8 (40 percent) countries, and less than 80 percent
in 6 (30 percent) countries.

Supplementary Immunization Activities
-------------------------------------
As part of the PAHO rubella and CRS elimination strategy, 2 different
types of supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are
recommended: one-time SIAs targeting all adolescents and adults, and
periodic follow-up SIAs usually targeting children aged 1-4 years.
One-time SIAs targeting all adolescents and adults are intended to
quickly interrupt rubella virus transmission and prevent future CRS
cases (5). Periodic follow-up campaigns provide a 2nd opportunity to
vaccinate children who were never vaccinated or who failed to develop
an immune response.

During 1998-2008, approximately 250 million adolescents and adults in
32 countries and territories were vaccinated against rubella in SIAs.
Three countries initially only vaccinated females during SIAs: Chile
vaccinated females aged 10-29 years in 1999, Brazil vaccinated
females aged 12-39 years during 2001-2002, and Argentina vaccinated
females aged 18-39 years in 2006. After those SIAs, transmission and
outbreaks of rubella mainly occurred among adolescent and adult males
in the 3 countries. Subsequent SIAs were conducted during 2007 and
2008 in Chile (1.3 million males aged 19-29 years in 2007), Brazil
(70 million males and females aged 20-39 years and 12-39 years in 5
selected states in 2008), and Argentina (6.5 million males aged 16-39
years in 2008). Aruba and Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the French
departments (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and Martinique), Panama, the
United States, and Uruguay introduced RCV in the routine childhood
schedule greater than 20 years ago, thus protecting large cohorts of
the adult population. As a result, these countries decided not to
implement adolescent and adult SIAs. All Latin American and Caribbean
countries that have introduced RCV since 1995 have implemented at
least one follow-up campaign.

Surveillance Activities
------------------------
Case-based measles and rubella surveillance is carried out in all
countries of the Americas and reported weekly to the regional level.
All public and private health-care providers are required to report
suspected measles and rubella cases; however, reporting is
incomplete, particularly in the private sector. Since 1996, serum
specimens from patients with suspected measles testing negative for
measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody have been tested for
rubella-specific IgM antibody. In 1999, regional rubella surveillance
was integrated with existing case-based measles surveillance in the
PAHO regional measles and rubella laboratory network of 21 national
and 124 sub-national laboratories. Within the integrated measles and
rubella surveillance system, measles or rubella cases are counted as
suspected when a health-care worker suspects that a patient has
measles or rubella infection. Rubella cases are counted as confirmed
when a patient has laboratory-confirmed rubella (IgM positive) or an
infection that meets the clinical case definition and is linked
epidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case. A suspected CRS
case is defined in any infant whose mother had laboratory-confirmed
rubella infection during pregnancy or in any infant who has
congenital anomalies compatible with CRS. A confirmed CRS case is
defined as infection in a child with compatible birth defects and
documented laboratory evidence of rubella infection during the 1st
year of life (6).

During 1998-2006, confirmed rubella cases decreased 98 percent, from
135 947 to 2998 (data illustrated by a figure in the original text).
A shift in distribution and increase in cases in 2007 resulted from
outbreaks, particularly among males, in Argentina (96 cases), Brazil
(8683 cases), and Chile (4235 cases), countries that initially
vaccinated only females in rubella SIAs. During 1 Jan-20 Sep 2008, a
total of 2039 confirmed rubella cases were reported in the PAHO
region, of which Argentina, Brazil, and Chile accounted for 98
percent. In response to these outbreaks, countries intensified
surveillance activities and vaccination interventions by conducting
SIAs among adolescents and adults. Countries that have completed SIAs
for all adolescents and adults have not reported any endemic rubella
cases [These data are tabulated in the original text.].

In 2007, 975 suspected CRS cases were reported in the 34 countries
with CRS surveillance; 4 countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and
Peru) accounted for 947 (97 percent) of these cases. 19 cases were
confirmed by detection of rubella IgM antibody, 17 from Brazil and 2
from Peru. During 1 Jan-20 Sep 2008, confirmed CRS cases were
reported in Argentina (one), Brazil (3), and Chile (2).

During 2003-2007, wild-type rubella viruses of genotypes 1C and 2B
were endemic in the Americas. Viruses of genotypes 1E, 1G, 1j, and 2B
have been linked to imported cases.

PAHO recommends the use of performance indicators to measure measles
and rubella surveillance quality. The current standardized
surveillance indicators and targets recommended in countries of the
Americas to monitor progress toward rubella elimination include: 1)
weekly notification by 80 percent of reporting units (i.e., health
clinics, usually at least one for each municipality), 2) greater than
80 percent of suspected measles/rubella cases investigated
adequately, 3) 2 or more suspected cases of measles or rubella per
100 000 persons detected and reported (to monitor the sensitivity of
the surveillance) and 4) greater than 80 percent of suspected
measles/rubella cases with serologic testing. In 2007, among 34
reporting countries and territories in the region, these respective
targets were met by 88 percent, 72 percent, 71 percent, and 85
percent of countries. Aruba and Netherlands Antilles, Canada, the
French departments, and the United States do not report indicator
data regularly.

Beginning in 2009, 2 additional indicators and targets will be
monitored by countries and PAHO: 1) greater than 80 percent of
confirmed cases are accompanied by follow-up of contacts for 30 days
(to monitor occurrence of secondary cases); and 2) greater than 80
percent of outbreaks have adequate specimens collected for virus
detection and isolation.

MMWR Editorial Note
----------------------
In response to ongoing rubella circulation and the potential for
major epidemics, PAHO developed a comprehensive strategy in 2004 to
eliminate rubella and CRS from the Americas by 2010. Countries have
demonstrated progress toward the rubella and CRS elimination goal;
however, outbreaks have occurred, primarily among males, in countries
that only vaccinated females during mass campaigns. By implementing
the comprehensive strategy and including males in SIAs, countries are
able to limit or prevent future outbreaks. By the end of 2008, all
countries and territories of the Americas will have implemented the
PAHO-recommended vaccination strategies.

In 2005, the United States was the 1st country in the Americas to
declare it had eliminated endemic rubella virus transmission (7). In
accordance with the PAHO biennial work plan, 20 additional countries
are expected to begin the process of verifying interruption of
rubella virus transmission in 2009. To prepare for verification of
elimination of rubella and CRS in the Americas, PAHO is developing a
strategic plan to guide countries on how to document elimination. In
addition, in 2007, the 27th Pan American Sanitary Conference approved
a resolution that defined the final steps for reaching the rubella
elimination goal by 2010, including formation of national commissions
to compile and analyze data and an international committee to
document progress toward interrupting transmission (8).

As the final stage of rubella elimination approaches, several
challenges remain, including the continued risk for rubella
importations and limited collection of specimens for virus detection
and isolation. To confront the challenges, PAHO has been working with
countries to 1) maintain high population immunity through high
routine vaccination coverage and completion of high-quality SIAs; 2)
maintain high-quality integrated measles-rubella surveillance and CRS
surveillance, including distributing practical field guides,
monitoring confirmed CRS cases for virus excretion with at least 2
consecutive negative specimens, and improving the participation of
clinicians in the private sector in surveillance activities; 3)
strengthen the WHO regional measles and rubella laboratory network in
the Americas, including emphasis on obtaining specimens for
genotyping; and 4) increase training opportunities for health workers
and interdisciplinary teams of epidemiologists, virologists, and
clinicians.
