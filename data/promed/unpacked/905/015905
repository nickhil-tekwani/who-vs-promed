Comment on outbreaks of Norwalk-like virus infection in institutions
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Institution-associated outbreaks of gastroenteritis frequently (>50 per
cent) are caused by Norwalk-like virus (proposed new genus name
_Norovirus_). [The genus name _Norovirus_ has to be ratified at the plenary
meeting of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses in Paris
in August. - Mod.CP]. Sources of infection usually are contaminated food
and/or water. The pattern noted so far in this outbreak is that of a common
source. Person to person spread also occurs, and some interesting data from
investigators such as David Brown and colleagues at Colindale (Public
health Laboratory Service Central Public health Laboratory) suggest
persistence of the causative agent on surfaces as a mechanism for prolonged
disease activity even in patients/persons new to the facility, despite
usual cleaning procedures.
Examination of stool -- kept at 4 degrees Celsius, not frozen -- by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction, is the diagnostic method of
choice. Although knowledge of the primers etc. needed for this assay has
widened, the reference labs still have the best information on best primer
selection for currently and locally circulating strains.
The observation "this has not happened here before" is not uncommon. I wish
I knew the incidence of such outbreaks by facility type, but do not know of
a good study of this issue. A recent estimate was of about 21 million
illness episodes per year in the United States for Norwalk-like virus
infections. This may be a large underestimate. We just don't have good
surveillance data.
