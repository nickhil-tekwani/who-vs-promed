The Larimer County Department of Health and Environment reported Friday [9 Aug 2019] that tularemia, also known as "rabbit fever," has been found in a rabbit in northern Larimer County.

Tularemia-causing bacteria from the droppings or urine of sick animals, usually rabbits, can contaminate soil and spread the disease, according to a news release from the health department.

A recent die-off of rabbits suggested a possible tularemia outbreak among the animals in that area, the agency said.

"Because tularemia is naturally occurring in Larimer County, precautions should always be taken to prevent infection, public health director Tom Gonzales said in the release. "It is important to keep children and pets away from wild animals."

In recent years, most human tularemia cases along the Front Range have been attributed to activities involving soil and vegetation, the health department said. The county has seen 18 human cases since 2009; 35 animals have tested positive for the disease since 2009.

Tularemia can be transmitted to people who handle infected animals; from the bite of infected insects (most commonly ticks and deer flies); by exposure to contaminated food, water, or soil; by eating, drinking, putting hands to eyes, nose, or mouth before washing after outdoor activities; by direct contact with breaks in the skin; or by inhaling particles carrying the bacteria (through mowing or blowing vegetation and excavating soil).

Typical signs of infection in humans may include fever, chills, headache, swollen and painful lymph glands and fatigue.

Tularemia can be treated with antibiotics, and the health department recommended anyone with any of these early signs seek medical attention as soon as possible.

The agency also advises people wear gloves when gardening; wear dust masks when mowing or blowing vegetation or moving soil; wear insect repellent to deter biting insects; wear shoes on grassy lawns; and never touch dead animals with bare hands.

[Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_(Type A) is associated with lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water. - Mod.PMB
