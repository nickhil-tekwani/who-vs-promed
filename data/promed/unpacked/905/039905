Jorge Fossatti, a member of the team that is caring for the patient, indicated that the patient is the 1st serious case of [hantavirus infection] registered so far this year [2012]. The patient is a 61-year-old man from the El Hoyo locality who was taken to the Esquel Area Hospital. He began to have the 1st symptoms in the middle of last week and is now in intensive care. His physicians state that he will come out of this situation [alive].

Fossatti, one of the physicians following the development of the patient, commented that this is [a] serious hantavirus clinical picture, for which they have taken all necessary care-taking measures, and luckily the patient has had a slight improvement. "He has not totally improved, but has shown slight improvement," the physician stated.

Fossatti stated that in case the patient totally recovers, no sequelae will remain.

[This report does not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for this case, but since Esquel, in Chubut province, Patagonia region is in the mountains near the Chilean border, Andes virus is the likely pathogen involved. The report does not indicate if the hantavirus etiology has been laboratory confirmed, but implies that the patient's symptoms are compatible with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, common in Andes virus infections.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
