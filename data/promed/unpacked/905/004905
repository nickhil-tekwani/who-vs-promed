The latest numbers of confirmed chikungunya fever cases in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines have been released with 175 cases of the mosquito borne viral disease being reported by the Department of Health's Center for Health Development (DOH-CHD-6) in Western Visayas yesterday [2 Sep 2013].

Negros Occidental province is reporting the most cases at 93, with Antique following with 57; Iloilo with 13; and Guimaras having 12. No reports have been received yet from Capiz and Aklan.

DOH-CHD-6 officials say it is vital for doctors and health personnel to report, investigate, and confirm suspected cases of chikungunya to guide control and prevention programs.

Since the same mosquito vector transmits both chikungunya and the more serious dengue fever, vector control is the key for effectively controlling both viral diseases.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes.

Chikungunya fever is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings (e.g., joint swelling), laboratory testing [the most important], and the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes.

There is no specific treatment for chikungunya fever; care is based on symptoms. Chikungunya fever is not usually fatal.

Steps to prevent infection with chikungunya virus include use of insect repellent, protective clothing, and staying in areas with screens.

Chikungunya virus was 1st isolated from the blood of a febrile patient in Tanzania in 1953, and has since been cited as the cause of numerous human epidemics in many areas of Africa and Asia and most recently in limited areas of Europe.

[Chikungunya cases continue to pop up in various parts of the Philippines. Unfortunately, there are some discrepancies in the reported numbers of cases between these reports. For example, the above report indicates that there have been 57 cases in Antique province, whereas a 4 Sep 2013 report quotes the Antique Provincial Health Office as indicating that the latest count of chikungunya virus infections was 1102 -- a far different number (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130904.1923385).
