HEALTH UNITS ADVISE AGAINST DRINKING APPLE CIDER
The health unit in Haliburton-Kawartha in central Ontario was cited as
saying in a news release it's come across a number of _E. coli_ cases
linked to patients drinking unpasteurized cider.
Bob Hart, Waterloo's health unit manager, was cited as saying that cider
can be contaminated by animal feces in orchards where livestock are allowed
to roam. [Or birds, or deer, etc. - RAL]
He says children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems
should only drink pasteurized cider.

In a related story, the Hamilton-Wentworth Public Health Department was
cited as warning Friday that recent outbreaks of "hamburger disease" have
been linked to drinking unpasteurized apple cider.
Susan Tamblyn, medical officer of health for the Perth District Health Unit
was cited as saying that no cases have been reported in the area, but nine
have been reported in Perth county since mid-October and they are all
related to the same batch of pressed apple cider.
Several cases have also turned up in the Waterloo region and in
Haliburton-Kawartha.
Susan Harding-Cruz, Public Health Inspector Supervisor with the
Hamilton-Wentworth Public Health Department was quoted as saying, "What
we're trying to do is just ensure parents are made aware." said.
The story says that apples can become contaminated if they come into
contact with animal feces, possibly through fertilizer containing manure,
or droppings from wild animals, and that the bacteria can be killed through
pasteurization.
Alexis Grolla, microbiology program specialist at the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA), was quoted as saying, "Most of the juice in
Canada is pasteurized. We're dealing with a small percentage of the juice
industry" adding that most cider producers don't pasteurize.
The story says that after a similar outbreak in 1996 in the U.S., CFIA
developed a code of practice for fresh cider production, outlining how to
handle the machines and the fruit to avoid contamination, but Grolla was
cited as saying the code is a guideline, not a law and has been widely
distributed within the industry. Grolla was quoted as saying, "That doesn't
mean to say that everyone who has ever produced cider has seen it. We've
tried to reach a wide market, but that doesn't mean we've reached
everyone." (and just because it reached people does not mean that it has
been followed; that audit role - dp)
The story says that Bennett's Apples and Cider Ltd. on Highway 53 has taken
the code one step further -- they started pasteurizing their cider last
year.
Todd Bennett, manager of the farm market, was quoted as saying, "We felt
that if the _E. coli_ problem popped up a couple more times, it would wipe
out the entire apple cider business and we didn't want to take that
chance," (good for them -- dp) adding that they never had a problem with
the bacteria.
At Bennett's, the apples are flash pasteurized, raw cider is heated at 170F
for six seconds and then rapidly cooled. Bennett was quoted as saying,
"What we end up with as far as I'm concerned is the exact same (taste) as
it was before. This has been proven that it's absolutely safer."
Bennett's also makes apple cider for several other farm markets.
