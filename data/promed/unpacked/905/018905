More Cases Admitted to Hospital From Kiganjo Police College
-----------------------------------------------------------
New cases from Kiganjo Police College have been admitted at Mathari Hospital
in Nyeri as top medics said they were still probing the nature of a
mysterious disease that has hit the institution. A top Central Province
physician, Dr Eliud Mwangi, said that medics have not yet concluded what the
disease was but they had ruled out Ebola [hemorrhagic fever virus as a cause
of the outbreak.
Mwangi did not say how many recruits had been admitted to the hospital. He
described the mysterious disease as a "silent outbreak", saying that stool
samples of all cooks and other workers at the police college had been taken
for analysis. "We have done Widal tests to establish whether there is an
outbreak of typhoid. We have also tested the patients for malaria and we are
still awaiting the results."
Following the emergence of the complaints, the doctor said that total
surveillance will be maintained at the College for the next 3 weeks to
unravel the [cause of the mysterious fever. The symptoms of the mysterious
disease, Dr Mwangi added, included diarrhoea. "We have tested both the water
and sewerage system samples but we have not been able to tell where the
problem is coming from," Dr Mwangi said. So far, he said, nothing positive
had been detected from the numerous tests which had been conducted at the
college.
Mwangi, who was briefing the Director of Medical Services, Prof Richard
Muga, said precautions have been taken to ensure that the situation did not
get out of control. He said one of the patients who had earlier been feared
to be suffering from Ebola fever, was now thought to be suffering from
brucellosis. "Since the patient comes from a community with close links
with livestock, we cannot rule out the possibility of brucellosis which has
symptoms almost similar to those of typhoid and malaria".
He explained that, when a female recruit died last week, it was decided that
all patients from Kiganjo Police College should be treated at Mathari
Hospital to localize the problem to one institution.
