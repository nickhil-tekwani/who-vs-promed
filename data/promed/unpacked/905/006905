The Mexico Viejo restaurant in Taylorsville, NC, about 60 mi [approx. 96 km] north of Charlotte, [NC], remained open after as many as 45 customers reported illnesses to the local health department. Officials from the Alexander County Health Department said on [Fri 22 Jun 2018] that one _E. coli_ infection has been confirmed. One person was hospitalized due to the illness.

County health director Leeanne Whisnant said the health department was notified [Fri 22 Jun 2018] morning, about the confirmed case of _E. coli_. The health department issued a press release on the outbreak to local media and on Facebook that afternoon. She said at least 30 individuals have reported getting sick after eating chicken at the Mexico Viejo restaurant on [Wed 20 Jun 2018]. Most reported experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea within hours of eating at the restaurant located on Highway 90 East.

The health department sent environmental health specialists to the restaurant on [Fri 22 Jun 2018] and brought in the State Communicable Disease Branch and the State Environmental Health Division to work on the outbreak.

Anyone who ate at the Mexican restaurant on [Wed 20 Jun 2018] and who has since become ill should call the county health department at 828-632-9704. Anyone experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea should stay hydrated and seek medical attention if the symptoms become worse or do not subside, according to Whisnant.

If the illnesses remained linked to only [Wed 20 Jun 2018], Whisnant says the outbreak could be an isolated event. Alexander County has not had any multiple _E. coli_ cases in 20 years. At this point, dishes containing chicken served on [Wed 20 Jun 2018] are the suspected source of the illnesses. Those who've reported their illnesses to the Health Department also say they've recovered quickly.

The [Alexander County] Health Department said about 100 people have reported getting sick after a possible outbreak of enteropathogenic _E. coli_ at Mexico Viejo in Alexander County, NC. One person tested positive for enteropathogenic _E. coli_, or EPEC, after dining at the restaurant on Highway 90 in Taylorsville, NC, health officials said. On [Fri 22 Jun 2018], health officials reported 30 possible cases, but that number grew to about 100 on [Mon 25 Jun 2018].

Alexander County health director Leeanne Whisnant said environmental health specialists were sent to inspect the restaurant on [Fri 22 Jun 2018].

Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ is a bacteria that causes severe stomach cramps, diarrhea that is often bloody, vomiting, and sometimes a low-grade fever, according to health officials.

The restaurant is being cooperative, officials said. Officials are asking customers who ate at Mexico Viejo on [Wed 20 Jun 2018] and have experienced symptoms to call the Health Department.

We [WSOC-TV] obtained the last 3 inspection reports for Mexico Viejo. Each time the restaurant was given a score of 96, which is an A.

[A number of _E. coli_ strains have acquired virulence factors to become pathogens that could be called enteropaths, diarrheagenic _E. coli_. These strains differ relating their virulence factors, and clinical manifestations are referred to as

Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC)
Diffusely adherent _E. coli_ (DAEC).

Most clinical laboratories have not been able to specifically identify any of these except for EHEC. Newer technologies using multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) have become available and are moving from reference to more standard clinical laboratories to test for a cluster of organisms, including

Enteric adenovirus
Astrovirus
Norovirus
Rotavirus A
Sapovirus
Cryptosporidium
_Cyclospora cayetanensis_
_Entamoeba histolytica_
_Giardia lamblia_
_Campylobacter (jejuni, coli and upsaliensis_)
_Clostridium difficile_ (toxin A/B)
_Plesiomonas shigelloides_
Salmonella
Shigella
_Yersinia enterocolitica_
_Vibrio (parahaemolyticus, vulnificus and cholerae_)
Enteroaggregative _E. coli_ (EAEC)
Enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC)
Enterotoxigenic _E. coli_ (ETEC)
Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)
Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC).

Testing is done by probing for specific virulence factors for each type of organism. In my experience, reports of ETEC and EPEC in the stool often occur when the clinical circumstances are not particularly consistent with the diagnosis and asymptomatic colonization occurs. Before being convinced that EPEC is the culprit here, it would be useful to have multiple identifications. The illness due to EPEC is generally self-limited and usually resolves without specific interventions. - Mod.LL
