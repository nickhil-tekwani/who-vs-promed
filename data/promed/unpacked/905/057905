A popular Siberian tiger is the 7th big cat to die of canine distemper
at a Wylie rescue center.

Tacoma, 14, lived at In-Sync Exotics Wildlife Rescue and Education
Center since he was 9 months old. He had been rescued from a breeder
trying to produce white tiger cubs and quickly became one of the most
popular cats at the center. He died Sunday [25 Aug 2013] night.

As an aging tiger, Tacoma had developed degenerative arthritis in his
hip, which was treated with a groundbreaking surgery in March [2013].
But his recovery was slowed after he was diagnosed with canine
distemper.

"He was starting to get better and stronger, and then this hit. He was
just never able to completely bounce back from either one," said Lisa
Williams, media director for In-Sync.

To date, 22 big cats have been diagnosed with canine distemper at the
center. Officials believe it was spread through the population by
raccoons. There is no vaccination against canine distemper for large
cats.

Tacoma was the 6th tiger to die of the disease and 4th of 6 siblings.
A lioness has also died from canine distemper. His death has struck
volunteers at the center especially hard. He was known to have a close
relationship with founder Vicky Keahey.

"Each of these losses has been devastating to us, but Tacoma is
extremely special to Vicky, our founder and president," the center
posted on its Facebook site. "She is going to need good thoughts and
prayers from every one of us to make it through this."

Tacoma's enclosure is at the front of the center, and he was known to
ham it up for visitors, often snorting bubbles while he swam in his
pool. "Tacoma is the soul" of the center, Williams said.

Though there is no cure for canine distemper among the big cats,
volunteers and veterinarians have been gathering blood and tissue
samples from the diseased cats to send to researchers, Williams said.

The cats have been quarantined, treated with antibiotics and vitamins,
but there is no guarantee that any of them will return to normal
health.

"They're these big, beautiful animals that should be able to overcome
anything," Williams said. "It's been a rough summer to say the
least."
