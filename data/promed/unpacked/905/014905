The pig disease occurring in recent days in Guoxian Village of
Guoxian Town in Beijing's Tongzhou District has now been identified.
According to a press statement on 22 Dec 2006 from the Beijing
Municipal Prevention and Treatment of Serious Animal Disease Command
Post, the Beijing Veterinary Diagnosis Institute and comprehensive
analysis by experts have determined that the cause of illness is a
combination of swine mycoplasmal pneumonia and hog cholera. It
cannot be transmitted to humans.
At the beginning of December 2006, 80 pigs at a farm in Guoxian
Villlage became ill exhibiting fever, lack of appetite and other
symptoms. After the pigs became ill, the farmer sold the sick pigs
to 2 non-local traders who said they were buying the pigs to feed
martens.
After this incident, the Office of Beijing Municipal Prevention and
Treatment of Serious Animal Diseases Command Post and the municipal
Agricultural Bureau immediately sent personnel to Guoxian Village to
guide prevention and control efforts and track the whereabouts of
sick and dead pigs. Thorough cleaning and disinfection of pen[s] at
farm[s] with sick pigs were carried out to prevent spread of the
disease.
At present, Beijing has not discovered large-scale pig illness or death.

[Hog cholera, known also as swine fever, is a viral, contagious
febrile disease of pigs. Two distinct viruses cause 2 distinct swine
fevers which are clinically indistinguishable: Classical swine fever
(CSF), caused by a pestivirus (family Flaviviridae) and African swine
fever (ASF), caused by a different virus, which belongs to the family
Asfarviridae. ASF is confined to the African continent with sporadic
exceptions, while CSF is distributed worldwide, being endemic in much
of Latin America, some Caribbean islands, and pig-producing countries
of Asia. Both diseases are notifiable to the OIE and, in view of
their international significance, were included in List A until its
recent cancellation.
The mycoplasma, reportedly identified in the sick Chinese pigs, is
most probably _Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae_ , a microorganism known to
be involved in respiratory infections in pigs, particularly a
condition called Enzootic pneumonia or Mycoplasmal pneumonia. This is
a chronic, clinically mild, infectious pneumonia of pigs. Both may
appear simultaneously.
In a recent notification to the OIE, the Chinese authorities reported
cases of mixed infection of classical swine fever, porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome and porcine circovirus.
If Swine fever (most probably Classical swine fever) is confirmed by
the laboratory in the current event, notification to the OIE is
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
