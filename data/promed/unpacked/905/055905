Study: vCJD blood test accurate enough for large-scale screening
----------------------------------------------------------------
In a large trial, a test to detect the abnormal prion protein associated with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) performed well enough to conclude that it can be used to screen populations at risk for the disease, scientists reported in JAMA Neurology [see below]. Variant CJD, a degenerative brain disease, is the human counterpart of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or mad cow disease), which, the report notes, may have infected as many as 3 million cattle in the United Kingdom. The authors, led by Graham S. Jackson, PhD, of the University College of London Institute of Neurology, used the test on blood samples from 5000 US blood donors, 200 healthy British donors, 352 patients with non-prion neurodegenerative diseases, 105 patients deemed likely to have prion diseases, and 10 patients with confirmed vCJD. The test showed 100 percent specificity (no false-positives) in the US donors (who were presumed to be free of prion disease) and in the healthy British donors. Likewise, it produced no false-positives among the patients with nonprion neurodegenerative diseases. Among patients believed likely to have a prion disease, 2 who had sporadic CJD tested positive (98.1 percent specificity; 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 93.3 to 99.8 percent). And in a small set of samples from unaffected persons and patients known to have vCJD, the test showed 70 percent sensitivity (95 percent CI, 34.8 to 93.3 percent), which reconfirmed previous findings.

The authors said the test performed well enough to justify using it to screen a large sample of the British population and at-risk groups to estimate the prevalence of blood prions among British blood donors. Such an estimate would help policy makers decide whether routine vCJD screening is needed for blood, tissue, and organ donations and for patients facing high-risk surgical procedures.

Abstract
--------
Importance: Our study indicates a prototype blood-based variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) assay has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to justify a large study comparing vCJD prevalence in the United Kingdom with a bovine spongiform encephalopathy-unexposed population. In a clinical diagnostic capacity, the assay's likelihood ratios dramatically change an individual's pretest disease odds to post-test probabilities and can confirm vCJD infection.

Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of a prototype blood test for vCJD and hence its suitability for clinical use and for screening prion-exposed populations.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, cross-sectional diagnostic study of blood samples from national blood collection and prion disease centers in the United States and United Kingdom. Anonymized samples were representative of the US blood donor population (n = 5000), healthy UK donors (n = 200), patients with nonprion neurodegenerative diseases (n = 352), patients in whom a prion disease diagnosis was likely (n = 105), and patients with confirmed vCJD (n = 10).

Main Outcome and Measure: Presence of vCJD infection determined by a prototype test (now in clinical diagnostic use) that captures, enriches, and detects disease-associated prion protein from whole blood using stainless steel powder.

Results: The assay's specificity among the presumed negative American donor samples was 100 percent (95 percent CI, 99.93-100 percent) and was confirmed in a healthy UK cohort (100 percent specificity; 95 percent CI, 98.2-100 percent). Of potentially cross-reactive blood samples from patients with nonprion neurodegenerative diseases, no samples tested positive (100 percent specificity; 95 percent CI, 98.9-100 percent). Among National Prion Clinic referrals in whom a prion disease diagnosis was likely, 2 patients with sporadic CJD tested positive (98.1 percent specificity; 95 percent CI, 93.3-99.8 percent). Finally, we reconfirmed but could not refine our previous sensitivity estimate in a small blind panel of samples from unaffected individuals and patients with vCJD (70 percent sensitivity; 95 percent CI, 34.8-93.3 percent).

Conclusions and Relevance: In conjunction with the assay's established high sensitivity (71.4 percent; 95 percent CI, 47.8-88.7 percent), the extremely high specificity supports using the assay to screen for vCJD infection in prion-exposed populations. Additionally, the lack of cross-reactivity and false positives in a range of non-prion neurodegenerative diseases supports the use of the assay in patient diagnosis.

Study examines blood test to screen for fatal variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 'Bottom Line' is that a blood test accurately screened for infection with the agent responsible for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a fatal neurological disease, according to Graham S. Jackson, Ph.D., of the University College of London (UCL) Institute of Neurology, and his colleagues.

vCJD is a fatal degenerative brain disorder thought to be caused by a misfolded protein (prion) in the brain and contracted most commonly through eating infected beef. Up to 3 million cattle in the United Kingdom may have been infected with BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and establishing accurate prevalence estimates through screening for vCJD infection would guide public health initiatives.

The researchers previously developed a test to detect low levels of prion protein in the blood. In this study, they used the test on samples from national blood collection and prion disease centers in the US and the UK to see if it was accurate enough to screen large numbers of people. Samples represented US blood donors (n = 5000), healthy UK donors (n = 200), patients with non-prion neurodegenerative disease (n = 352), patients in whom a prion disease diagnosis was likely (n = 105) and patients with confirmed vCJD (n = 10).

The new results confirm that the test was perfectly specific, meaning it was always negative in negative American donor samples and healthy UK patient samples. No samples tested positive from patients with nonprion neurodegenerative disorders. The test found 71.4 percent of patients with vCJD correctly tested positive.

In conclusion, the prion assay (test) used in this study is accurate enough to screen populations at risk for vCJD. "Most importantly, the prototype vCJD assay [test] has sufficient performance to justify now screening a large UK population sample and at-risk groups to produce an initial estimate [which is currently lacking] of the level of prionemia [prions in the blood] in the UK blood donor population.... A blood prevalence study would provide essential information for policy makers for deciding if routine vCJD screening is needed for blood, tissue, and organ donations and patients prior to high-risk surgical procedures."

[vCJD (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is a fatal degenerative brain disorder thought to be caused by a misfolded protein (prion) in the brain and contracted most commonly through eating infected beef. Up to 3 million cattle in the United Kingdom may have been infected with BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). A test and establishing accurate prevalence estimates through screening for vCJD infection would guide public health initiatives. In this study, researchers used a test on samples from national blood collection and prion disease centers in the US and the UK to verify the accuracy of the test to determine its ability to screen large numbers of people. Samples represented US blood donors (n = 5000), healthy UK donors (n = 200), patients with non-prion neurodegenerative disease (n = 352), patients in whom a prion disease diagnosis was likely (n = 105) and patients with confirmed vCJD (n = 10).

This study employed a prototype blood-based variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease assay and has verified that it has sufficient sensitivity and specificity to validate its future use in any large study comparing vCJD prevalence in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in a clinical diagnostic capacity. The assay's likelihood ratios dramatically change an individual's pretest disease odds to post-test probabilities and can confirm vCJD infection. - Mod.CP]
