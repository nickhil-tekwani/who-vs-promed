Red tide shuts down some state shellfish beds
-------------------------
A toxic "red tide" has forced the state to shut down shellfish beds from
the New Hampshire border to Cape Cod Canal.
The algae plume, which state biologists said is the worst outbreak of red
tide in 12 years, comes at the start of the shellfishing season. The
outbreak is the worst since 1993, when red tide closed much of the
Massachusetts coastline.
"If I lose what I have ready to harvest, I'd lose up to $400 000," said a
Duxbury oyster farmer.
Michael Hickey, the state's chief shellfish biologist, said his team of
scientists detected the high level of the red tide toxin on Friday
morning. "We're not going to sit around and wait for this to become a
public health problem," he said. Hickey said everything that's already
gone to market is fine.
On Friday, the state closed beds from the New Hampshire line to the eastern
edge of the Cape Cod Canal in Sandwich. Boston Harbor remained open to
commercial fishermen who hold a special permit. Hickey said red tide is
rarely detected in Boston Harbor's waters because ocean currents pull the
algae north up the coastline. New Hampshire closed its coastline to
shellfish digging on Thursday.
Red tide occurs when temperature and sunlight combine to cause explosive
growth of a particular algae, which turns the water red in the most extreme
blooms. Clams, oysters, and other shellfish that ingest the algae are
poisoned and concentrate the toxin. People who eat infected shellfish can
get paralytic shellfish poisoning, or PSP.
Nobody in the United States has died of PSP since red tide first arrived
here in 1972, Dave Whittaker, a senior marine biologist with the state
Division of Marine Fisheries, told The Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence.
Quincy shellfish warden Andy Ayer said he's seen shellfish bed closings
last as long as 10 weeks. The outbreak won't cripple the shellfishing
industry, but it will hurt, he said.
"There'll certainly be shellfish here," he said. "It will just be more
expensive."

[Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin, it
is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it causes
shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially on
both the east and west coasts of the U.S. Produced by several closely
related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for
persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish,
but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish
larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell accumulations that
discolor the water and may instead be invisible below the water surface.
Low-density populations can cause severe problems due to the high potency
of the toxins produced. Furthermore, _Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in
relatively pristine waters, and it is difficult to argue that anthropogenic
nutrient inputs are stimulating the blooms. These characteristics are
important when considering mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is caused
by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which at high concentrations can
make the water look red. The organism releases a toxin that paralyzes the
respiratory system of fish and other marine life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak can keep people
from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide
irritates skin and can cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and
coughs. Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is
discouraged. Red tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and
may last for several days.
Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium breve_,
but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of dinoflagellates. Its new
name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_. Karenia was chosen in honor of
Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red tide scientist from the Florida
Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg, FL.
