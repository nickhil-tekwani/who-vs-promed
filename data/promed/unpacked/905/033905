Hem. fever, renal synd. - Russia (Tatarstan) 20000204144414

Source: Nezavisimaya Gazeta in Russian, 10 Feb 2000; [Report by Yevgeniy
Solovyev

The principal of a primary school in the village of Miklyaikha and 16 of
her pupils found themselves in hospital where they were diagnosed as
suffering from "hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome" [HFRS. People here
do not recall there ever being such an outbreak of this infectious disease.
Veterans at the Rayon sanitary and epidemiological supervision center
recall a case that occurred in the early 1970's in the Sudilevo military
unit located near this village when seven servicemen died from hemorrhagic
fever. There were 23 cases of this disease, which is transmitted by mice
and rats, in Tutayevskiy Rayon last year. This time 17 people with a high
temperature, headache, and other symptoms of the fever have been
hospitalized in the Central Rayon Hospital's infectious disease department.
The primary school where the sick children studied is located in a
hundred-year-old one-story wooden building whose basement and utility
buildings have long been populated by rodents. There is no money in the
local budget to carry out cleansing work. Rats run over the desks on which
the children study and eat. In the opinion of Tutayevo epidemiologists, the
children needed only to breathe the same air as the rodents transmitting
the infection in order to catch hemorrhagic fever.

[Classical HFRS is caused by the mouse-transmitted Hantaan virus, the
prototype hantavirus. A milder form of this disease is Nephropathia
Epidemica, caused by Puumala virus, also a hantavirus. That we do not have
information on the etiologic agent of this particular outbreak prevents us
from commenting further on the likely outcome of these illnesses, although
my guess is that it is NE. Of course, both viruses may be involved, which
would confuse the epidemiologic issue considerably. Yaroslavl Oblast is
about 300 km north northeast of Moscow. The previous report of HFRS (Hem.
fever, renal synd. - Russia (Tatarstan) 20000204144414) pertained to the
occurrence of a similar, possibly identical, disease in Tatarstan, which is
about 560 km northeast of Moscow, so this recent report is not an update or
extension of the previous one. This indicates that HFRS and/or NE is
widespread in Russia at this time. There are many hantaviruses, each one
transmitted by a particular rodent species, so it is important to determine
the specific agent of these outbreaks. Given that there are insufficient
funds to repair the Yaroslavl Oblast school, it is unlikely there are
laboratory resources available to determine the infecting agent. Seven
deaths in servicemen in the 1970s and 23 cases last year tells us very
little that might help identify the agent of disease, except that it is
pathogenic for humans, some of whom die. Given that hantaviruses are
transmitted by aerosols of feces and saliva from infected rodents, this is
a very serious situation. I would hope that local authorities have
contacted the World Health Organization for assistance in stemming this
epizoodemic. Keeping in mind that it is winter in Russia, a time when the
prevalence of hantavirus infections are not usually at a maximum. This
Yaroslavl episode may also be a common source outbreak. - Mod. CHC
