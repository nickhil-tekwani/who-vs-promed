A rabies notice has been issued for residents near Stony Hill Road in
Wake Forest, NC. Wake County health officials say a case of rabies
was confirmed on 6 Jul 2010 in a fox near Rivermead Lane and Stonewyck Lane.

"We don't want to alarm residents in the Wake Forest and North
Raleigh areas, but they should be aware of this case and of the
potential for exposure to themselves, family members and their pets,"
said Michael Williams, Animal Control director for Wake County.

[2] New York City, Central Park, raccoon bite

Raccoon Bites Woman In Central Park
-----------------------------------
Just as the Parks Department publicly pat themselves on the back for
practically ridding the city of rabid raccoons, a woman who was
recently bit by a raccoon comes forward.

In short, the victim had been sitting on a bench right on the 72nd
Street Transverse, near the Mall and Bethesda Fountain, when a
raccoon snuck up behind her, walked under the bench, and bit her from
behind." Her ankle bleeding, some passerby stopped to help her out,
and she eventually got to Lenox Hill Hospital

So what happens when you're bit by a rabid animal? Apparently you get
a round of 4 rabies shots and a tetanus shot, on top of a Rabies
Immune Globulin injected around the wound. There doesn't seem to be
proof that this raccoon was rabid, as it was never located after the
incident. The woman helping the victim declared that a healthy
raccoon would not be out during the day. However, this could have
been a healthy mother trying to find food for her babies.

The Parks Department had no comment on the incident when we reached
them this morning, however, the Department of Health told us:
"Wildlife is a feature of every habitat, including New York City.
Raccoons, skunks, bats, stray dogs and cats can carry rabies... stay
away from wild animals as our goal is to manage wildlife in a way
that is safest for animals and people." So, uh, watch your ankles out there.

A bobcat that attacked 2 dogs and scratched a person trying to rescue
the dogs has tested positive for rabies, police said.

The attack occurred about 6:30 p.m. Saturday [3 Jul 2010] at a home
on Terry's Plain Road. Police said a resident, whose identity was not
available, told them that a bobcat attacked his 2 dogs.

One person was scratched by the bobcat while trying to get the 2 dogs
away from it. The homeowner was able to subdue the bobcat and hold it
in a small cage until police arrived.

The animal was taken to the state lab for testing on and on Monday [5
Jul 2010] police learned that the bobcat was rabid, said Sgt. James
White. The dogs were up to date with rabies vaccinations and the
person exposed to the bobcat will seek treatment, White said.

County issues rabies alert after rabid fox bites Statesville man
----------------------------------------------------------------
A 20-year-old man is undergoing treatment after being bitten by a
rabid fox Monday [21 Jun 2010] at a home on Devon Lane in
Statesville, NC. Carla Waller said her niece's boyfriend, the victim,
underwent the 1st series of 6 shots and faces more to protect against
the potential for rabies.

A group of people, including 6 children, were in and around the pool
when a gray fox came through the yard and through the fence
surrounding the pool. The fox went straight for the water as family
members scrambled to get the children out of the pool, she said.

Her father threw a ball toward it, and it ran outside the fence into
some bushes on the other side, she said. Waller's son and the victim
went outside the fence to try to shoo it away, fearing it might come
back into the pool area. The victim grabbed a toy bat and the fox
attacked the bat, then latched onto his leg, biting him on the leg
and ankle, she said.

Iredell County Care and Control officers were called and arrived
within 15 minutes. Officers shot the fox when it charged toward them.
Meanwhile, the victim was taken to Davis Regional Medical Center and
treatment began right away.

On Wednesday [23 Jun 2010], the victim received a call that the fox
was indeed rabid.

Neighbors told Waller they'd seen a fox in the area during the
daytime in the last week or so. That is a clue that the animal might
be rabid, said Iredell Animal Care and Control Director Chris Royal.
It's unusual for foxes to be out during the daytime hours.

Royal said this is the 9th rabies case in Iredell County this year.
So far, the infected animals include the fox, 1 bat, 2 cows, 4
raccoons and 1 skunk.

A city message is being sent to people within a 5-mile radius of
where the fox was captured to warn residents about the rabies
potential. Royal said this underscores the importance of making sure
family pets are vaccinated against rabies.

Bobcat that killed 2 pigs in Indiantown tests positive for rabies
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A bobcat that killed 2 pigs last week has tested positive for rabies,
according to the Martin County Health Department.

The bobcat attacked several pigs 7 July 2010 at a ranch on Southwest
Foxbrown Road. The pigs that survived the attack will be placed under
quarantine for 6 months.

This is the 2nd case of rabies in Martin County this year. Another
bobcat tested positive for rabies in May [2010] after attacking a
horse in Palm City.

A handful of rabies cases have been reported across the Treasure
Coast. All of Indian River County remains under a rabies alert until
August [2010] following 5 attacks on humans by rabid animals.

Rabies is a virus spread through the bite or scratch of an infected
animal. Any mammal, including humans and domestic animals, can get
rabies. If you get bitten by an animal, wash the wound with soap and
water for at least 5 minutes and seek medical attention.

New Hanover Co. confirms 6th case of rabies
-------------------------------------------
New Hanover County Animal Control authorities have confirmed the 6th
case of rabies so far this year [2010]. A Mimosa Place family
reported their 3 dogs had fought and killed a wild raccoon on Monday
[5 Jul 2010]. Test results returned from the state lab confirm the
raccoon was rabid. The dogs' owners have taken the pets for their
required rabies booster vaccination.

Animals that have a current rabies vaccination at the time of
exposure should be re-boostered within 5 days (new Centers for
Disease Control guidelines) of exposure. The CDC recommends
unvaccinated pets be destroyed. There are 3 primary routes of
transmission of the rabies virus, which is carried in the saliva of
the infected animal: 1) the primary route of transmission is through
a bite which breaks the skin of the victim, 2) salivary contact to an
open, fresh wound, or, 3) salivary contact to the mucous membranes of
a potential victim.

When dealing with primary rabies vectors (raccoons, foxes, skunks,
and bats) or unknown animals, such as wildlife, it is recommended
that the animal be handled with protective gloves to prevent viral
transmission. Personal pets should not be handled without protection
directly after being exposed to wildlife, due to the potential for
carrying residual saliva from the infected animal. People should stay
away from any animal that they have not been cleared to hold or pet,
including owned dogs or cats, and especially wildlife.

Rabid fox bites Barre man
-------------------------
A gray fox that bit a man on the ankle last week in Barre was rabid,
Vermont Department of Health biologists confirmed on Tuesday.

The man was bitten 1 July 2010 on Pond Street, said a health
department official. "He got out of his vehicle, was minding his own
business, the fox came out of the blue, bit him on the ankle and sort
of ran away," said Bob Johnson, a public health veterinarian with the
Vermont Department of Health who often deals with rabies cases.

The victim of the bite quickly went to the hospital to begin
treatment, which means he will be fine, said Johnson. "He just got
bit, and shots will keep him safe," said Johnson.

The bite victim was not the only one to encounter the rabid fox,
which was found dead last Friday [2 Jul 2010], said Johnson. "I guess
it tugged at the pant leg of another individual, and another person
found it dead the next day," said Johnson. "There were a number of
people that had some sort of brush with that fox."

A game warden with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department was
called in, bagged the dead fox and had it sent to a state lab on the
Fletcher Allen Health Care campus in Burlington, VT, where
microbiologists ran tests on the deceased animal, according to
Johnson. The biologists confirmed the presence of the lethal virus.

Cases of humans getting rabies are extremely rare, said Johnson, with
only one or 2 cases nationally each year. "I think it's safe to say
no human cases of rabies have ever been reported to the Vermont
Department of Health," said Johnson.

The rabid fox is the 26th confirmed case of rabies in Vermont this
year, which means the state is on pace to have an average number of
cases in 2010, said Johnson. This was the 1st case in Barre this year
and the 3rd in Washington County. A rabid bobcat was discovered in
Northfield last month and a gray fox was found in Fayston in April,
according to Vermont Department of Health records. Last year a rabid
skunk was found in Barre.

[According to the CDC regulations on post exposure prophylaxis
regarding rabies:

Rabies postexposure vaccinations consists of a dose of human rabies
immune globulin and 4 doses of rabies vaccine given on the day of the
exposure, and then again on days 3, 7, and 14. The vaccine is given
in a muscle, usually in the upper arm. This set of vaccinations is
highly effective at preventing rabies if given as soon as possible
following an exposure.

Each state has slightly different regulations regarding treatment of
animals who are vaccinated but exposed. Please check with your state
if your animal has been exposed to a rabid animal. Unvaccinated pets
are generally euthanized. - Mod.TG]
