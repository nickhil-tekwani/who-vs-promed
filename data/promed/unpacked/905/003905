Experts have warned that there could be a massive wipe-out of birdlife, as well as a serious threat to residents in Kimberley [Northern Cape province], as avian botulism is being suggested as the most likely cause of the deaths of more than 1000 water birds at Kamfers Dam.

A water analysis expert from the Free State, Dr Jan Roos, together with the [Northern Cape] provincial state veterinarian, Dr Mcdonald Gayakaya, and Kamfers Dam farm owner, Herbert Booth, inspected the dam and found hundreds of dead or dying geese, ducks and flamingos scattered on the banks or in shallow water. Roos was called in to collect water samples by Birdlife South Africa and the Save the Flamingo Association, and to analyse the dam's water quality, while Gayakaya collected some of the dying birds to determine the cause of death.

The dying birds started appearing 3 weeks ago [November 2013], according to Booth, who owns the farm on which the dam is situated. Roos, who has done various tests at Kamfers Dam in the past, said he suspected that the birds had died from avian botulism, as they all displayed the same signs of paralysis.

Avian botulism is paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria, _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacterium is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a rich protein source and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxins.

"Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxins."

Gayakaya added that the birds with botulism would die of starvation, as they could not move their bodies or wings to eat or drink. He took samples of various birds that were paralysed, but still alive, as he said these samples would ensure more accurate blood tests.

It is expected to take about a week to determine if there is botulism toxin in the birds. If the tests are positive, there could be a massive amount of deaths of water birds at Kamfers Dam if urgent measures are not put in place to reduce further exposure to the toxin.

"A botulism outbreak is extremely difficult to control. Carcasses of dead birds will have to be collected to reduce exposure to other birds and scavengers. The inflow from the Homevale Waste Water Treatment Works will also have to be monitored to ensure the radical reduction of organic matter flowing into the dam.

"There is an anti-toxin available, but it is very expensive and difficult to administer to infected birds," Gayakaya said.

He further said that once the tests were conducted it would be the responsibility of the Sol Plaatje Municipality and the Northern Cape Department of Nature Conservation and Environmental Affairs to take control of the implementation of corrective measures. He said although indirect exposure to humans did not pose a threat, the ingestion of the toxin could be lethal to humans. "This could be a problem if people eat the dead birds."

The 3 men estimated that the number of dead birds had already reached more than 1000, judging by the number of carcasses observed and the extent of the dam's shoreline.

Roos indicated that polluted water flowing into the dam from the Homevale Treatments Works weeks ago, could have contributed to the outbreak. "Sewage water (in untreated water running into the dam), coupled with the high temperatures and little rainfall, make for an optimal breeding environment for botulism. The content of organic matter is just too concentrated. The problem at Kamfers Dam is that there is no outflow. This means all the material from the storm drains and sewage lines end up in the dam where it accumulates, without any way of being flushed out," he said.

Mark Anderson, CEO of Birdlife South Africa, said the mortalities were extremely unfortunate. "If the municipality had done more to address the inflow of poor water quality, the negative affects on Kamfers Dam's birds could be prevented."

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C, and to a lesser extent type E, while humans are affected mainly by types A, B and E. Although wildfowl and domestic livestock botulism has been recognized as a problem in southern Africa, very few human cases have ever been described in the region (types A and B). - Mod.PMB
