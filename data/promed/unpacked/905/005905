State officials confirmed Friday [23 Aug 2013] a yellow fever mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_], which can transmit a number of viruses including yellow fever, was found in San Mateo County. The last time a yellow fever mosquito was confirmed in San Mateo County was in 1979.

San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District found the mosquito this week at Holy Cross cemetery in a residential area of the city of Menlo Park.

The _Aedes aegypti_ species is not native to California; however it is a common mosquito in urban areas of the southeastern United States.

The yellow fever mosquito has the potential to transmit several viruses, including dengue and yellow fever.

This type of mosquito was found earlier this summer [2013] in the counties of Fresno and Madera; no illnesses associated with this mosquito have been reported so far.

The San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District is working closely with San Mateo County Health System, the California Department of Public Health, and Santa Clara County Vector Control District to evaluate the extent of the infestation and aggressively target problem areas to prevent its spread.

"Our goal is to quickly eradicate this mosquito population," said Robert Gay for San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control District. "We will do everything to help ensure this mosquito does not become established in our communities." The Mosquito and Vector Control District will expand surveillance efforts for this type of mosquito. The district will deploy a variety of traps for adult mosquitoes and mosquito eggs surrounding the location where the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito was found. Additionally, District staff will be conducting door to door inspections of homes and providing educational materials to residents in the neighborhood.

The _Aedes aegypti_ species is a tiny (about 0.25 inch/6 mm) black and white mosquito that bites most often during the day, and can transmit dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and several viruses that cause encephalitis. These viruses are not currently found in California.

This mosquito was previously found in San Mateo County in 1979 near SFO [San Francisco], but was successfully eradicated by the Mosquito and Vector Control District and did not become established [in the county].

"It's important to note that the current risk of disease transmission from this mosquito is extremely low," said Dr Scott Morrow, Health Officer for San Mateo County. "But we must make every effort to eradicate this mosquito and not allow it to establish itself here to prevent future disease transmission risk. The public can really play a critical role in helping to control the spread of this mosquito population. The yellow fever mosquito lays its eggs in water, just above the water line in small containers and vessels that hold water, such as pots, pet bowls, bottles, and birdbaths. It's important to survey your yard and around your house to eliminate even the smallest amount of standing water."

It's important to avoid mosquito bites or reduce the chances of being bitten by taking the following precautions:
- Apply insect repellents that contain DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR 3535 and follow label instructions.
- Make sure that doors and windows have tight-fitting screens to keep out mosquitoes and repair or replace screens with tears or holes.
- Eliminate standing water and containers that can hold water from around the home.
- Report neglected swimming pools by calling San Mateo County Mosquito and Vector Control(650) 344-8592 or the Santa Clara Vector Control District (408) 918-4770.
- Wear long sleeve shirts and long pants when possible.
- Use mosquito netting over infant carriers, cribs, and strollers.

[It appears that _Aedes aegypti_ is spreading in California. Now there are 3 counties where this mosquito has been detected. One hopes that aggressive control measures will be successful in eliminating it from these counties. One also hopes that adjoining counties and mosquito abatement districts are intensifying their surveillance efforts for early detection, should these mosquitoes appear there.
