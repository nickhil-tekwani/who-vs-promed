The Health Ministry [Malaysia today confirmed that a new strain of
the "Hendra encephalitis" virus has been found in people from pig
farms in Negri Sembilan, who had been admitted to hospital for
Japanese encephalitis (JE).
To date, 33 people had died in Negri Sembilan which the authorities
earlier said was due to JE virus which [is spread by mosquitoes.
Director-General of Health Tan Sri Abu Bakar Suleiman said the new
deadly virus had been detected in 19 of the 98 cases admitted to
hospital. "In addition to the JE outbreak, a new virus has been
isolated from some of the patients in Bukit Pelanduk and this virus
is a member of the family of paramyxovirus," he told reporters here
[Kuala Lumpur. The JE virus was also present in the pig farms, he
said. He said the new paramyxovirus was related to the Hendra
encephalitis virus which was detected in Australia in 1994 and 1995,
and it killed two people and 15 horses there.
"This isolation was done in the Department of Medical Microbiology,
University Hospital, Kuala Lumpur, with the help of the Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, USA," he said. "We
do not know about the way it is transmitted and the little
information that is obtained is in relation to illnesses in horses
and the detection of the virus in bats in Australia," he said. "So
far, we have no knowledge that it is transmitted in pigs and we also
have no knowledge that it can be transmitted from pigs to humans and
vice versa," he said.
He said the probable mode of transmission of this virus was by direct
contact with tissue fluids, including urine but research also showed
that the virus was not carried on the breath of horses. "We do not
know the role of this virus in relation to JE. There is no doubt in
my mind that there is an outbreak of JE," he said.
Abu Bakar said due to the isolation of the new virus, additional
measures must be taken by the pig handlers such as wearing protective
clothing, boots, gloves, gowns, goggles and face shields and washing
of hands and body parts before leaving the pig farms.
Meanwhile, Head of the Department of Medical Microbiology, Universiti
Malaya, Prof Laam Sai Kit said paramyxoviruses [are a group of
enveloped RNA viruses whose members had been shown to cause animal
and human infection. Several new viruses belonging to this family had
been isolated in Australia since 1994 including the Hendra virus.
"Experimental studies have shown that in horses and cats, the virus
causes fatal pneumonia and also in other animals including fruit
bats, birds and guinea pigs," he said.
Findings of the patient who died of meningo-encephalitis showed a
brief period of aseptic meningitis illness after caring for two
infected horses that died from the same disease. He said researchers
had shown that infected animals excreted the virus in their urine.
The virus is not carried through the breath of horses and is not
highly contagious.

[The finding of Hendra virus or Hendra-like virus in the JE outbreak
in Malaysia is unexpected although moderators JW and CHC have hinted
at the possibility of mixed aetiologies in the outbreak because of
the unusual epidemiology including fatalities occurring almost
entirely in those working in pig farms or associated with the pig
farm industry and the non-protection of JE vaccine in some of these
workers. This is truly an emerging disease and we look forward to
more information coming out from Prof Lam's lab. I also understand
that a team from CDC will be arriving next week to assist in the
investigation. - Mod.CYC

The Malaysian government said Friday a mysterious new virus had been
found in a pig-breeding region where dozens of people have died,
compounding confusion over a deadly outbreak of disease.
Director-general of health Abu Bakar Suleiman said the new virus was
part of the Paramyxo family of viruses, unrelated to the
mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis (JE) which authorities had
blamed for an outbreak which has killed at least 53 people.
But officials are convinced Japanese encephalitis is also present in
the region, and the military and police will press ahead with a plan
to eradicate the disease through the mass slaughter of thousands of
pigs and fumigation, authorities said.
Troops and police had planned Friday to cordon off three villages in
Negri Sembilan state, southwest of the capital, and begin shooting
tens of thousands of pigs. But they postponed the operation until
after dawn Saturday.
At least 33 people in the pig-farming area of Negri Sembilan, about
100 km (60 miles) from Kuala Lumpur have died, bringing the death
toll since October there and in Perak state to 53, officials said.
All of the victims have lived on or near pig farms.
A slaughterhouse worker who handled live pigs imported from Malaysia
died in Singapore Friday. Singapore officials said they had not
determined the exact cause of death beyond establishing that it was
not Japanese encephalitis.
Malaysian Health Minister Chua Jui Meng said the number of pigs to be
slaughtered had soared to 311 000, and 2300 soldiers and police would
be pressed into duty, evacuating residents from the affected area of
Negri Sembilan before Saturday morning.
"At the rate of 35 000 per day, we are looking at 10 days before the
culling can be completed,'' Chua told reporters.
News that a second deadly virus had been identified added to the
confusion which has prompted many panic-stricken residents of an area
to flee their homes, abandoning their pigs.
Abu Bakar said "This new virus is probably related to a virus first
identified in 1994 in Australia. It comes from a group of viruses
called the Paramyxoviruses. It is a new virus, probably related to
the Hendra virus, but it is not the same.''
The Hendra virus, named after the Brisbane suburb where the first
identified outbreak occurred, is known to have killed two people and
16 horses in Australia, according to the Australian government's
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO).

Before it was isolated in 1994, the Hendra virus had never been
reported anywhere in the world.
Scientists believe fruit bats, or flying foxes, are the natural host
of the virus, the Australian research agency said in fact sheet on
its Website (www.ah.csiro.au).
"The transmission rate appears to be very low and the virus is not
highly contagious from what we know,'' Abu Bakar said.
But CSIRO said that in 1996, the Hendra virus was classified as
requiring Level-4 security, the highest level security procedures.
All people working with the virus are required to wear a "space
suit'' with its own air supply.
"We should be cautious in dealing with the pigs and those working in
the farms should wear protective clothing,'' Abu Bakar said.
He said the virus was transmitted through direct contact with tissue
fluids, including urine.
"We do not know the role of this virus in relation to JE,'' he said.
"There is no doubt in my mind that there is an outbreak of JE.''
