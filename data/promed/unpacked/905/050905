Mosquito season has officially arrived in Louisiana and along with it 2 potentially fatal diseases. West Nile virus (WNV) and eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) are prevalent in Louisiana and can cause death in horses.

So far, 5 horses have died from EEE across Louisiana, the majority of which could have been prevented with vaccination. WNV and EEE are both viral diseases that cause encephalitis and meningitis (infection of the brain and spinal cord or their protective covering). While each disease is caused by a different specific virus, they are both transmitted to horses by being bitten by an infected mosquito.

There are vaccines currently available to help prevent WNV and EEE. A minimum yearly booster is required, while stressed horses and/or those traveling frequently due to show schedules, or that live in warm, humid climates such as Louisiana, should be vaccinated 2x a year. Vaccinating your horses against mosquito borne viruses is an inexpensive way to help reduce the possibility of infection. However, vaccination alone is not 100-percent effective.

There are some easy steps you can take to prevent mosquitos from affecting your horses:

Avoidance
House horses indoors during peak periods of mosquito activity if possible (dusk & dawn). Reduce use of lighting during peak periods of activity. Use fans to help keep mosquitos off horses while they are stabled. Use chemical repellents specifically designed for use on horses.

Reduction
Eliminate areas of standing water on your property. For example, tires, manure storage areas, drainage areas with stagnant water, wheelbarrows, pots, and shallow ponds. Clean out livestock water troughs weekly or add a supply of mosquito fish which will feed on mosquito larvae. Clean out storm drains and gutters in areas where horses are kept.

For more information on these viruses, you can contact Steve Borel at either 336-2416 or 687-5155.

[This is very early in what could be a long EEE season.

This article gives good advice for minimizing exposure of horses to mosquitoes. However, the immunity to EEE wanes quicker than does the immunity to West Nile virus. Therefore, in areas such as Louisiana and most of the Gulf coast states and eastern seaboard states, or any area with a prolonged warm humid environment, vaccination every 3-4 months may be necessary to protect your horse from EEE. Of course, the additional vaccinations must be used in combination with the tips listed above on eliminating mosquito breeding sites and with appropriate sprays for horses. - Mod.TG
