A Nipah virus scare has gripped the Guna district of Madhya Pradesh as hundreds of bats have been found dead in the campus of National Fertilisers Limited (NFL) in the past few days. Initially, the district authorities reported deaths of around 2500 bats, but the district administration claimed that the death toll is around 250.

Veterinary physician of Guna, Dr. BS Dhakrey claimed that bodies of hundreds of bats have fallen in the last week or so [9-15 Jun 2019] at NFL premises. "We have collected the samples from the spot and have sent them to [a] veterinary laboratory in Bhopal," Dr. Dhakrey added.

Prima facie it seems that high temperature or heat stroke could have brought about the demise of the bats, said the physician. Chief Medical and Health Officer of Guna, Dr. PS Bunkar claimed there is no evidence of Nipah virus locally, but on a precautionary note, an alert has been sounded in the area, taking a cue from the Nipah outbreak in Kerala. The NFL officers also claimed that bats have started dropping dead from the trees in the past few days and by Thursday [13 Jun 2019], hundreds of dead animals were scattered in the complex, which is inhabited by hundreds of families. The company said that after spotting dead animals, they informed the municipality and health department. Later the team from the forest department also reached the spot. The company is also planning to send teams of physicians and paramedical staff to 10 nearby villages to conduct health checks.

[Nipah virus (NiV) is a member of the family _Paramyxoviridae_, genus _Henipavirus_ and an important emerging zoonotic disease in Southeast Asia. NiV was 1st identified in Singapore and Malaysia during an outbreak of severe febrile illness with encephalitis in 1998-1999. In 2001, a Nipah encephalitis outbreak was reported for the 1st time from Meherpur district, Bangladesh; since then, sporadic cases and outbreaks were reported from various districts of the Indian subcontinent.

The natural reservoir hosts of NiV are flying foxes (_Pteropus_ spp.). They live in the tropics and subtropics of Asia (including the Indian subcontinent), Australia, East Africa, and a number of remote oceanic islands in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. At least 60 extant species are in this genus. The species found in the Indian subcontinent is the Indian flying fox (_Pteropus giganteus_). The report does not mention the bat species involved in this die-off. Flying foxes are tolerant to NiV. The pathogenic findings following experimental infections have been benign. It is unclear why this die-off is attributed to NiV, nor it is stated whether tests have confirmed the infection. - Mod.PMB
