A NSW [New South Wales] man has been confirmed as the 3rd fatality in Australia's largest outbreak of listeriosis. The death of the 68 year old man late last month [January 2013] was confirmed by Victoria's acting chief health officer as being linked to the outbreak at Jindi, one of the nation's biggest cheese companies. The outbreak, which has been traced to the company's factory in Gippsland, Victoria, has been linked to the deaths of an 84 year old Victorian man and a 44 year old Tasmanian man. 26 cases have been identified so far, including a New South Wales woman who had a miscarriage.

Victoria's Department of Health maintains it acted promptly to contain the outbreak, which came to the attention of authorities in mid-December [2012] and led to the recall of more than 100 cheese products, but it has warned there could be more cases and further fatalities.

"I'm confident the intervention that has been put in place with terrific cooperation from Jindi is absolutely appropriate and is the best possible," said the acting chief health officer, Michael Ackland. "Unfortunately because of the 70 day incubation period for listeriosis, there will almost certainly be people who have consumed cheese prior to the recall who may still get sick -- that could go on for another couple of months."

[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in 4 prior ProMED-mail posts last year (2012):
Listeriosis - New Zealand: (HB) nosocomial, fatal 20120720.1209143;
Listeriosis - UK (02): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, comment 20120418.1105643;
Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822; and
Listeriosis - USA: (NJ), perinatal 20120316.1072439.

The total number of cases has risen from 21 when last posted on ProMED-mail (Listeriosis - Australia: fatal, soft cheese, recall 20130125.1514992) to 26, now with 3 deaths and one miscarriage. This outbreak has occurred nationwide and the last recall of cheeses apparently has been relatively recent, but the exact date of this recall has not been specified in the news reports posted by ProMED-mail. With an incubation period of up to 70 days, more cases of listeriosis associated with this outbreak can be expected.

The news report says that the outbreak has been traced to the Jindi Cheese company's factory in Gippsland, Victoria but does not say on what basis the linkage was made, that is, did the genotypes of _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolated from patients match that of any isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ from the recalled cheeses?

The Australian mainland is made up of 5 states (Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria, and New South Wales), and 3 territories (Australian Capital Territory, Northern Territory, and Jarvis Bay Territory), with the 6th island state of Tasmania to the south of the mainland. In addition, there are 6 island territories, known as external territories, and the Australian Antarctic Territory (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia). A map of Australia showing its states and territories can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia.
