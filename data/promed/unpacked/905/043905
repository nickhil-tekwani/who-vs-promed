BUFFALO POX (HUMAN) - INDIA (PRESS REPORT)
==========================================
A report in The Times of India (Ahmedabad Edition) dated 24th March
1996 states that Buffalo pox has been recently detected in five
children in Beed District of Maharastra State in India.
The Director of National Institute of Virology, Pune, Dr. Kalyan
Banerjee is reported to have stated "The disease is different from
Small Pox. The lesions and appearence are different". Explaining the
Infection, he stated that the infection in humans "may be due to
gradual change in the evolution of the virus. Further work needs to
be done and the virus should be watched very carefully for its
emergence". He further stated "We cannot say how serious it is; we
have to be careful about it".
Dr. K.K. Dutta of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases
says small pox virus has not reappeared for the last 21 years while
dismissing any immediate fear from the virus. However he says "one
does not know how another species will behave when one species gets
extinct".
Buffalo pox has been reported in buffaloes from Punjab, Haryana,
Maharastra, UP and Kerala. The disease is also reported in Italy,
Indonesia and Pakistan.
