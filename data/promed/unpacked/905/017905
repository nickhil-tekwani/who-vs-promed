Medical malpractice is suspected of causing more than 200 people in south China's Guangdong province to become infected with hepatitis C virus. The number, counted by patients themselves in the township of Zicheng in Zijin county, Heyuan city, has not been confirmed by local health authorities. According to local residents, all of the infected had received injections at a clinic in the township with suspected reused needles.

Experts have been organized to investigate, Yi Xuefeng, office director with the provincial disease prevention and control authorities, said Thursday [23 Feb 2012]. "These cases were initially identified before 2010, and the incident cannot be deemed as an outbreak of the disease," said Yi.

Hepatitis C is viral and is mainly transmitted through contact with contaminated blood, although it can also spread through sexual contact and from mother to child during delivery. Infections can lead to liver cancer.

[This is not the 1st outbreak of hepatitis C virus infection in China in recent times resulting from medical malpractice. Although the incident occurred more than a year ago, lessons have still to be learned, and the local authorities seem reluctant to accept responsibility.
