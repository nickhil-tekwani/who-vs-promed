Investigations undertaken by ministries of Health in Mali and Guinea, assisted by WHO, have clarified the early exposure history of Mali's 1st Ebola case.

The index case in Mali, a 2 year old girl who resided with her family in the urban commune of Beyla, Guinea, was diagnosed with Ebola, in Kayes, Mali on 23 Oct [2014] and died on the following day. The child's history while still residing in Guinea strongly suggests that several members of her family died from Ebola virus disease. Most of the patients described below were buried safely by Red Cross volunteers but not tested until late in the transmission chains... [There follows a detailed tracing of a chain of deaths in the extended family. - Mod.JW]

To date, Malian health officials, aided by WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and several other partners have identified 108 contacts of the symptomatic patient, including 33 health care workers who were exposed. Of the 108 contacts, 25 have been followed for 21 days and have been released from the surveillance system. 79 contacts were at the hospital where the child was treated and in the Kayes community. All have been monitored. To date, no one has shown signs of Ebola or tested positive for the disease...

With persistent and thorough contact tracing, isolation and monitoring in place, confidence is growing that no further spread within Mali followed exposure to the index case, who had haemorrhagic symptoms but no diarrhoea or vomiting during her travels... - more

[2] Sierra Leone: 111 new cases registered Sun 9 Nov 2014

The number of new cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone has jumped dramatically, ending any hopes that the infection rate is slowing [but see comment below]. Official figures released by the minister of health and sanitation show there were 111 new cases registered on Sunday [9 Nov 2014], the highest daily rate since the ministry started publishing figures in August [2014]. Sierra Leone's deadliest day was 5 Oct [2014], when 121 deaths were recorded from Ebola. Daily statistics compiled by Sierra Leone's Emergency Operations Centre for that day showed 81 new cases of the virus, fewer than those registered on Sunday.

There were 45 new cases the day before, including 24 in the capital, Freetown. Laboratory results for patients in Freetown, which include the new British army-built Ebola hospital, showed 40 new cases on Sun 9 Nov [2014]. There was also a spike in the number of cases in Port Loko, a district north of Freetown where there is still no treatment centre and where, until recently, corpses were left lying on verandahs, in hospitals and in houses for days before collection. The figures come days after warnings by the UN that Ebola cases in Sierra Leone are being underreported by up to 50 per cent. MSF is witnessing a decline in patients at its hospitals, with 200 empty beds in its 250-bed Monrovia hospital and no new patients in its Foya hospital in the north of the country.

Fasil Tezera, MSF head of operations in Liberia, said that the international response was finally getting off the ground, with financial support starting to flow into the country, but warned that priority must be given to a "flexible approach" that allows "a rapid response to new outbreaks... - more

[Random fluctuations in numbers of new cases are to be expected; it would be most peculiar if the same number of cases were reported every day. Spikes do not necessarily mean the situation is deteriorating. What counts is the average daily number over time, provided the criteria for suspected and probable cases remain the same. - Mod.JW]

[3] West Africa: school closures could mean illiteracy tomorrow

http://www.npr.org/blogs/goatsandsoda/2014/11/10/362302778/ebola-today-could-mean-illiteracy-tomorrow-in-west-africa


Ebola is threatening to reverse years of educational progress in West Africa. The virus has kept school closed for months in a part of the world where literacy rates are low, and school systems are only now recovering from years of civil war.

In Liberia, many children have been put to work while schools are closed, and Ebola is hurting the economy, says Laurent Duvillier, a communication specialist at UNICEF. The fear now, he says, is that many of these children will never return to school.

Linda Barrolle Saygbe says her 2 adolescent daughters study for 2 hours each day while schools are closed. But Barrolle Saygbe is frustrated that the girls' career aspirations have been put on hold. The risk is especially high for girls, who, until recently, received much less schooling than boys, Duvillier says. "Families may be tempted to keep the eldest girl at home to help them or to wash clothes for the neighbors," he says. "We don't want those girls to drop out of school because of Ebola... - more

[4] Liberia: impact of 21 day quarantine on MSF
Date: 10 Nov 2014

http://blogs.msf.org/en/staff/blogs/msf-ebola-blog/the-impact-of-news-from-the-usa


...What difference does 21 days make? One colleague, a professor at a prominent [Liberian] medical school, has been disinvited from giving a scheduled lecture (on Ebola and other infectious diseases no less!); another has decided to leave early to accommodate the days in quarantine in order to see his family at Christmas, and 2 colleagues scheduled to present their research at a conference in the USA cancelled their trips knowing they would not get through the airport. Also remember that these 21 days are added onto the time these folks have been away from their families, friends, and jobs. 21 days make a difference.

What difference does the lack of understanding make? One expat has been disinvited from his good friend's wedding, another from a scheduled vacation with friends and family, and another will be forced to remove his child from school for the first 21 days he returns to their home. Others have shared that they have not told their families and friends where they are on mission to avoid causing angst. Most of us have received emails asking us to return home. Finding people to commit to the mission here in Liberia is an issue.

The time a person can be effective in their job in this type of mission is limited. Between the travel time and briefs at HQ, you lose days. The training to become a safe, effective worker in this context takes time... likely 2 days in Brussels and another week working in an Ebola management center with experienced workers. Additionally, these missions are shorter than usual due to the physical and psychological impact of the context. Replacement workers are difficult to find and many are needed. Cutting corners on any of these will cause increased risk for workers, causing increased risk to others... at home and abroad. Adding a 21-day quarantine for healthy individuals only adds to the pressure.

The reality is that aid workers are needed here, and they also need to return home to their lives. We all agree that if a person becomes sick, they should quickly be isolated. Where does that leave us?

[5] Senegal: Ebola awareness through SMS campaign
Date: November 2014
Source: WHO [edited]
http://who.int/features/2014/senegal-ebola-sms/en


Senegal's recent stamping out of Ebola was achieved not only through its rapid infectious disease control work, but also by using a novel short message service [SMS]-driven platform originally designed to help people manage diabetes.

On 29 Aug [2014], Senegal's 1st -- and only -- case of Ebola virus disease was confirmed in a young man who had direct contact with an Ebola patient in Guinea and then travelled, by road, to Dakar. Together with WHO and partners, the government of Senegal launched an immediate, broad-based and well-coordinated response that stopped the virus dead in its tracks.

As part of a massive public awareness effort, Senegal's Ministry of Health sent 4 million SMS messages to the general public warning of the dangers of Ebola and how to prevent it. The messages, driven by the WHO-supported "mDiabetes" platform, were targeted at people living in the capital city of Dakar and St-Louis, a heavily populated region in the country.

Through the SMS campaign, launched in partnership with major mobile phone operators in Senegal, people were encouraged to alert health authorities of anyone showing signs of a fever and bleeding by calling a toll-free number. The messages were shared ahead of large-scale public events, including football matches and rallies... - more

[6] Guinea: concern about health crisis
Date: 9 Nov 2014
Source: Le Jour Guinee [in French, machine trans. edited]
http://www.lejourguinee.com/index.php/fr/presse-etrangere/4385-lutte-contre-ebola-la-guinee-avoue-son-impuissance


An official from the Guinean Ministry of Health is concerned about the risk of political instability in the country that could lead to a health crisis. "None of us expected this disease, and the weakness of our means of health monitoring has prevented us from reacting faster," Professor Aboubacar Sidiki Diakite, inspector general of the Department of Health of Guinea, conceded on Tue [4 Nov 2014]. Invited by the Academy of Medicine, France, the president of the national committee for the health crisis recounted the distress of his country facing the outbreak of Ebola.

"The disease started with us in late 2013, but was declared on 21 Mar 2014, when the WHO Lyon P4 [highest "pathogen" or "protection level"] laboratory identified the virus," said Diakite. "The disease was probably already present in our neighbors, but it went unnoticed."

Guinea, he has admitted, was initially disappointed in the message issued. "We said there were no drugs against this disease. The African reaction is then the fallback: we prefer to die in our families. Since then, the government is trying to explain that health centers are there primarily to treat patients, not only to isolate the dying. We had to learn to adapt our strategies to the various communities that inhabit Guinea. The secret," according to Professor Diakite, is to "rely on local leaders. The press and radio are not enough. Messages should be delivered by the right people, in whom people have confidence. Especially, he said, a large part of the population is illiterate. People do not understand the health measures."

Following people who have been in contact with a patient during the 21 days that incubation can last is a challenge. "We had over 16 000 contacts in total cases; it makes 3000-4000 people to follow every day! We need resources, vehicles and manpower. If you miss a contact, you create a risk. At one point, we thought we were at the end of the epidemic, and Doctors Without Borders has almost closed a processing center. But cases and contacts of suspected cases have escaped us, and new foci were created."

The 3 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) are, according to Professor Diakite, inseparable. "Our people are made from the same communities, and our countries are linked: the evolution of the epidemic is on the same curve."

As for international mobilization, it is "out of touch" with reality, he modestly stated, a reality that international bodies are far from measuring the extent of. WHO repeated on Wednesday [5 Nov 2014] its latest report (4818 deaths per 13 042 cases); it was well below the truth. "There are many dead missing," a WHO official told AFP, who said that the deaths could actually be twice as many... "Doctors Without Borders [MSF] has been there from the start, but is slowing over time. We, therefore, welcome the French mobilization," said Diakite.

[7] European Union: medevac planes from Luxembourg
Date: 6 Nov 2014
Source: European Commission Press release [edited]
http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-14-1462_en.htm?locale=en


The European Union and its member states have now pledged more than EUR one billion [USD 1.24 billion] in response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa. This means the EU has already gone beyond the target set by the European Council on 24 Oct [2014] for EUR one billion in assistance to stem the epidemic.

The EU is boosting its investment in Ebola research, sending more material aid and providing new capacity for medical evacuations of international aid workers. This announcement comes just ahead of the mission of the European Union's Ebola coordinator and commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, Christos Stylianides, and the commissioner for health, Vytenis Andriukaitis, to the Ebola-affected countries in West Africa...

The European commissioner for research, science and innovation, Carlos Moedas, said: "The EU is determined to help find a solution to Ebola. We are putting our money where our mouth is and boosting EU research on Ebola with an additional EUR 280 million [USD 348 million]. With this funding from Horizon 2020 and our industry partners, we are stepping up the development of new vaccines and medications to help save lives around the world" [See Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (31): Ugandan cured, Texas free, safety, funds 20141107.2938140].

The EU is also beginning its biggest single operation of transporting material assistance to the affected countries. A Dutch ship is sailing today [6 Nov 2014] from the Netherlands, loaded with ambulances, mobile hospitals, laboratories, and other equipment. The cargo has been provided by 9 member states (AT, BE, CZ, FI, HU, NL, RO, SK, UK) and UNICEF. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism is coordinating the operation.

"By pooling our resources, Europe's efforts make a much bigger difference on the ground. At a moment when the availability of medical evacuations is such a crucial factor for encouraging more medical workers to join the Ebola response, I particularly welcome Luxembourg's leadership on this priority with the contribution of [2] specially equipped planes," said commissioner Stylianides.

Luxembourg has become the 1st EU member state to commit aeroplanes for European medical evacuation operations of international humanitarian workers diagnosed with Ebola. The 2 planes are retrofitted for the purpose with co-funding by the European Commission, which will also finance the bulk of the transport costs for evacuations under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.

The United States on Mon 10 Nov 2014 opened the 1st of 17 Ebola treatment units it is building in Liberia.

The new clinic opened in Tubmanburg, about 60 km (40 miles) north of the capital, Monrovia. The number of people with Ebola appears to declining in the capital, but more cases are popping up in other areas of the West African country, according to the World Health Organization... - more
