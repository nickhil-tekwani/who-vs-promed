The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reporting the state's 1st case of the tick-borne Powassan virus since 2017. The Powassan virus -- which is rare but can cause severe illness -- is much less common than other tick-borne diseases such as Lyme or anaplasmosis. Nationally, about 7 cases are reported each year, and this is just the 11th case of Powassan virus in Maine since 2000, the CDC said in a statement Wednesday [24 Jul 2019].

So far this year [2019], Maine has reported 255 cases of Lyme disease, 327 cases of anaplasmosis and 36 cases of babesiosis, another tick-borne disease, through 23 Jul [2019], the Maine CDC reported.

The person who contracted the Powassan virus is an adult from southern Maine who has been hospitalized in New Hampshire, the CDC statement said. Health officials believe the patient contracted the virus in Maine. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services notified the Maine CDC of the case this week. The state did not provide additional information, which is standard.

The Powassan virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of a blacklegged tick or a woodchuck tick. "Powassan, although rare, can be serious so it is important to be aware of your surroundings and take steps to avoid being bitten by ticks," said Nirav D. Shah, director of the Maine CDC.

Symptoms include fever, vomiting, weakness, headaches, confusion, seizures and memory loss. The virus may cause long-term neurologic problems, and a severe infection can cause death.

The last cases of Powassan in Maine occurred in 2017, when 2 people contracted the virus. Both were hospitalized with encephalitis but made full recoveries.

There is no medication to treat the Powassan virus infection, unlike Lyme disease, which is a bacterial infection that can be treated with antibiotics.

Griffin Dill, integrated pest management professional at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, said he's not sure why Powassan [virus infection] is so rare in comparison to other tick-borne diseases. The extension operates a "tick lab" and while the lab currently does not test for Powassan virus, it does test tick specimens for Lyme, anaplasmosis and babesiosis.

"As prevalence of pathogens grows, Lyme disease leads the charge, and then it's later followed by increasing levels of other pathogens, like anaplasmosis and babesiosis," Dill said. He said 7% of all tick specimens sent to the lab are co-infected, which means they have 2 pathogens, carrying both Lyme and anaplasmosis, for example.

The Maine CDC recommends a number of preventive measures to keep ticks at bay, including wearing light-colored, long-sleeved clothing and long pants when out in the woods or brush; using insect repellent; staying on the trails; bathing after being out in tick habitats and performing frequent "tick checks."

[Powassan virus infections have occurred in Maine before, and the virus is probably endemic there. Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the USA, Canada, and Russia. In the USA, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region, including Maine. Cases of Powassan virus infection occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall, when ticks are most active. Residents and visitors in Maine and other localities where Powassan virus occurs are well advised to heed the CDC advice mentioned to avoid tick bites:

- Choose light-colored clothing so it's easier to spot ticks; wear long sleeves and tuck your pants into your socks.
- Use an EPA-approved insect repellent.
- Check your skin and clothing for ticks and remove them promptly. Don't miss warm, moist areas such as the ears, armpits and neck, and have someone else check your back.
- Wash possible tick bites with soap and water and apply an antiseptic.
- Keep your lawn mown and tidy to remove tick habitat.
- If you spot an embedded tick, use a tick spoon or tweezers to grasp its mouth [at skin level] and pull it out with steady pressure. Don't use petroleum jelly, hot matches or nail polish remover, which can increase the risk of infection.

The fact that cases of human Powassan virus infections occur only rarely does not mean that the above precautions should be ignored. - Mod.TY
