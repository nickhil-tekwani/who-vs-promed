[The Arctic fox (_Vulpes lagopus_) is listed as extinct in Finland, endangered in Sweden and critically endangered in Norway. Around the year 2000 there were only 40-60 adult individuals left, prompting the implementation of conservation actions, including a captive breeding programme for wild-caught pups.

Rabies is an important threat for this species. The virus is present in Siberia and Svalbard, whereas mainland Norway and Sweden are rabies free. - Mod.PMB
