Displaced people living in the Kabkabiya camps in North Darfur complain about the outbreak of a hitherto unknown disease among children. "The disease that broke out a month ago affects children up to 18 years old," the assistant coordinator of North Darfur camps told Radio Dabanga. "The symptoms are high fever, swelling of the body, and ulcers."

The spread of the disease caused panic among the more than 90 000 families living in the camps, "in particular because the medicine given to the patients does not help." The assistant coordinator called on the North Darfur Health Ministry to "act, diagnose the disease, and offer treatment."

In mid-September [2015], the coordinator of the camps in neighbouring Saraf Umra locality informed Radio Dabanga about the outbreak of an as yet unidentified disease causing swelling of the body and abdomen accompanied by fever, vomiting and coughing. He said the disease appeared in the 1st week of September [2015], with the accumulation of water and the spread of mosquitoes after heavy rains.

[The sudden onset excludes leishmaniasis, which is endemic in the area, and cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis are almost never seen together in the same patient. There is no mention of mortality, and the location of the ulcers are not reported. Are they present on the skin or in the throat? The body swelling could be edema, in which case renal failure could be an explanation; or it could be ascites, in which case liver failure could be a possibility. However, jaundice was not reported. If the mortality is high, anthrax should be considered, where the source could be infected meat which is eaten and touched. That, however, does not explain that it is primarily seen in children under 18 years.

ProMED-mail would be happy to post further information from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.EP
