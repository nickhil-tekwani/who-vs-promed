Outbreak of multidrug-resistant Salmonella newport -- US, Jan-Apr 2002
-------------------------
During Jan-Apr 2002, _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Newport (_S._ Newport)
was isolated from 47 people in 5 states: New York (34 cases), Michigan (5),
Pennsylvania (4), Ohio (2), and Connecticut (2).
Antimicrobial-susceptibility testing of 3 isolates by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed resistance to
amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur, cephalothin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. In
addition, 2 of 3 isolates were resistant to kanamycin; 2 had decreased
susceptibility or resistance to ceftriaxone.
To determine the cause of the outbreak, the New York State Department of
Health (NYSDOH) and CDC conducted a case control study. This report
summarizes the results of this investigation, which implicated exposure to
raw or undercooked ground beef as the vehicle of transmission. The findings
also highlight the emergence of multidrug-resistant _S._ Newport in the
United States. These strains exhibit decreased susceptibility or resistance
to ceftriaxone, thereby complicating empirical therapy for serious
salmonella infections. Clinicians should be informed of the emergence of
these _S._ Newport strains, and people should avoid eating undercooked
ground beef and wash their hands after handling raw ground beef.
[MMWR] editorial note:
An estimated 1.4 million cases of salmonellosis occur annually in the
United States. _S._ Newport is the third commonest salmonella serotype in
the US. During 1997-2001, the number of laboratory confirmed _S._ Newport
infections reported to CDC increased from 1584 (5 per cent) of 34 608
reported salmonella infections to 3152 (10 per cent) of 31 607 (CDC,
unpublished data, 2002). The increasing number of _S._ Newport infections
in the US appears to be associated with the emergence and rapid
dissemination of multidrug-resistant strains of _S._ Newport.
Since 1996, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS)
for Enteric Bacteria has identified an increasing number of _S._ Newport
isolates that are resistant to at least 9 of 17 antimicrobial agents
tested: amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftiofur,
cephalothin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, and
tetracycline. In addition, these isolates exhibit decreased susceptibility
(minimal inhibitory concentrations [MIC] more than 16 micrograms/mL) or
resistance (MIC more than 64 micrograms/mL) to ceftriaxone, an
antimicrobial agent commonly used to treat serious infections in children.
Isolates with this resistance pattern have plasmids that carry a blaCMY
gene. These genes produce AmpC-type enzymes, which confer resistance to
penicillin-inhibitor combinations (for example, amoxicillin/clavulanate),
cephamycins (for example, cefoxitin), and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins
(for example, ceftiofur and ceftriaxone). To distinguish this type of
resistance from other multidrug-resistant strains, these strains are
referred to as Newport MDR-AmpC. In 1998, 1 (1 per cent) of 78 _S._ Newport
isolates tested in NARMS was Newport MDR-AmpC compared with 33 (26 per
cent) of 128 in 2001. Although the full clinical significance of Newport
MDR-AmpC is unknown, treatment of these infections with ceftriaxone might
be ineffective. In addition, antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections
have been associated with an increased hospital admission rate, morbidity,
and mortality.
In 2001 and 2002 several state health departments, including California,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts documented association of exposure to dairy
farms, ill cattle, and cheese made from unpasteurized milk with increased
human _S. Newport_ MDR-AmpC infections. In the outbreak described in this
report, most patients for whom information is available ate lean or
extra-lean ground beef; dairy cattle are an important source of lean or
extra-lean ground beef. These data suggest that cattle, particularly dairy
cattle, might be a source for human Newport MDR-AmpC infection.
This report is the first to associate eating of ground beef, specifically
raw or undercooked ground beef, with Newport MDR-AmpC infection. Recent US
surveys indicate that 11 to 28 per cent of people report eating raw or
undercooked ground beef, and about a third of people do not use safe food
handling practices to prevent cross contamination in the kitchen.
The USDA Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points
(PR/HACCP) inspection system in meat and poultry plants has reduced
salmonella prevalence in raw ground beef from 7.5 per cent in 1998 to 2.8
per cent in 2001. The emergence of Newport MDR-AmpC suggests that further
measures may be necessary. Potential strategies include 1) evaluating
practices on the farm to determine factors that might contribute to
multidrug-resistant _S._ Newport and developing interventions to eliminate
these factors; 2) implementing the Public Health Action Plan to Combat
Antimicrobial Resistance; 3) encouraging industry to implement processes
such as steam pasteurization or irradiation of ground beef; and 4)
increasing efforts to educate consumers on the importance of safe handling
and cooking practices.
State health departments and veterinarians should investigate clusters of
_S._ Newport and perform antimicrobial-susceptibility testing to determine
if isolates are Newport MDR-AmpC. Epidemiological investigations and pulse
field gel electrophoresis comparison of outbreak isolates will help to
identify food vehicles associated with Newport MDR-AmpC and to identify
control points for reducing these infections. Because treatment with
ceftriaxone might be ineffective, clinicians should be informed of the
emergence of Newport MDR-AmpC strains. People should not eat undercooked
ground beef and should wash their hands after handling raw ground beef.

[This report in MMWR highlights the significance of _S. enterica_ serotype
Newport not only in numbers but also related to the increase in multidrug
resistance strains of the organism. Epidemiological investigations have
linked the strain to exposure to undercooked ground beef. As emphasized
above, and previously in ProMED-mail postings about contamination of ground
beef with _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7, even if food is contaminated the risk
to humans can be avoided by strict adherence to appropriate food handling
and adequate cooking.
The resistance pattern of these isolates limits potential treatment
modalities, especially in children and in pregnant women, in whom
quinolones are not generally used because of potential side effects. It
should be remembered, however, that most _Salmonella enterica_ infections
are self limiting and do not require specific antimicrobial therapy. - Mod.LL]
