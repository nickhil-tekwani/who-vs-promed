FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
16 Dec 2002

3 More Positive Cwd Cases Found in Illinois
-----------------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been detected in 3 more deer in northern
Illinois, the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced today,
bringing to 4 the number of confirmed cases of the disease in Illinois. CWD
is not known to be contagious to livestock or humans.

Of the 3 new cases, 2 were found in the vicinity of the first CWD case
reported in early November 2002. One positive case each was returned from
Boone, McHenry, and Winnebago counties. This represents the second instance
of a CWD-positive deer in Boone County. (Illinois' first case, originally
reported as from Winnebago County, actually was just over the county line
in Boone County). The locations of the 3 cases reported to date within
Boone and Winnebago counties are within approximately 2 miles of each other
in an area east of Roscoe, Illinois. The McHenry County positive deer came
from an area a few miles northeast of Woodstock. The new cases include a
2.5-year-old buck (Boone), a 1.5 year-old-buck (McHenry), and a
1.5-year-old doe (Winnebago).

The samples were taken as part of IDNR's CWD surveillance of deer harvested
during the firearm deer season. Testing was conducted at the Illinois
Department of Agriculture Disease Laboratories. A follow-up test on the
McHenry County case was conducted at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, confirming the diagnosis. Follow-up tests on the
Boone and Winnebago county animals were deemed unnecessary, given their
location and the contagious nature of the disease.

"It comes as no surprise we found additional cases near the first one,"
said IDNR Director Brent Manning. "The identification of a new location in
McHenry County, although an unwelcome result, does demonstrate our
surveillance program is proving effective. We will continue to study
results as they come in, in order to incorporate the best science into our
response strategies."

Illinois expanded its surveillance efforts regarding CWD earlier this year
and created a joint task force with the Departments of Natural Resources
and Agriculture following the CWD outbreak in southern Wisconsin. About
4000 samples of hunter-harvested deer were taken in 36 counties around
Illinois during the firearm deer season 22-24 Nov and 5-8 Dec 2002. Tests
have been completed on about 1450 samples, with only the 3 positive results.

"We continue to be committed to a long-term plan of stepped-up surveillance
and monitoring and taking all steps biologically appropriate to combat
chronic wasting disease in Illinois. Deer hunters and those who value the
health of wildlife and outdoor recreation in Illinois played an important
role during the firearm season and will continue to play an important role
in that process."

Counties sampled for CWD during the 2002 firearm deer hunting season
included: Jo Daviess, Stephenson, Winnebago, Boone, McHenry, Carroll, Ogle,
DeKalb, Whiteside, Rock Island, Bureau, LaSalle, Hancock, Adams, Pike,
Fulton, McLean, Vermilion, Sangamon, Macoupin, Shelby, Fayette, Effingham,
Clark, Lawrence, Madison, St. Clair, Clinton, Washington, Randolph,
Jefferson, Marion, Williamson, Union, Johnson and Pope. Counties were
selected based on a variety of factors including geographic location, size
of deer population and the number of facilities with captive deer or elk.

Chronic wasting disease is a fatal neurological disease found in deer and
elk. The disease affects the brains of infected animals, causing them to
become emaciated, display abnormal behavior, lose coordination, and
eventually die. It is not known to be contagious to livestock or humans.

CWD has been diagnosed in wild, free-ranging deer and elk as well as in
captive animals in a number of western states, but earlier this year was
found in neighboring Wisconsin and Minnesota.

For updated information about chronic wasting disease, including answers to
frequently asked questions and the Department's rules, please see our web

A web application that allows participating hunters to check the status of
test results for deer sampled during the firearm deer season should be
available this week.
