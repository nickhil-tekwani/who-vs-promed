[1] Brazil: SARS-CoV-2 and Guillain-Barré syndrome
Date: Thu 22 Oct 2020

http://www.saude.pi.gov.br/noticias/2020-10-21/10215/lacen-identifica-coronavirus-em-sistema-nervoso-de-paciente-com-sindrome-de-guillain-barre.html


The Piaui State Department of Health (SESAPI) reports that the genetic material of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient recently victimized by Guillain-Barré syndrome, in Teresina. This is an unprecedented finding, constituting the 1st documented case in the world in which the virus is detected in the nervous system of a patient with the disease. The exam was performed at the Central Public Health Laboratory Dr Costa Alvarenga (LACEN-PI).

Cerebrospinal fluid is a fluid that surrounds and protects the brain, spinal cord and roots of all nerves in the human body. This liquid is collected by puncture in the region of the lumbar spine, in suspected cases of the disease. Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by the acute loss of muscle strength and tenderness in the legs, arms, face and even the muscles of breathing. The disease is usually triggered by viral or bacterial infections -- especially the intestinal bacterium _Campylobacter jejuni_ and the Zika virus. In the face of an infection, sometimes the patient's immune system gets confused and starts to attack the individual's own nerves, mistakenly recognizing their wraps (myelin sheath) as if they were viruses or bacteria to be eliminated. In these situations, the use of the medication "hyperimmune human immunoglobulin" (available by SUS [Sistema Unico de Saude, publicly funded health service]) is indicated, in an attempt to interrupt the process of nerve damage by the immune system itself.

In view of the initial indications that COVID-19 could attack the nervous system of individuals, the local program for epidemiological surveillance of diseases with neurological manifestations started to include the research of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients from May 2020, at LACEN-PI. The RT-PCR test for the new coronavirus was added to the laboratory investigation panel for herpes virus, enterovirus and arbovirus -- among them: Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile virus. The surveillance program was initiated in 2013, as an initiative of the Municipal Health Foundation of Teresina in partnership with SESAPI and the Evandro Chagas Institute. This surveillance strategy had already been responsible for detecting the country's first case of encephalitis by West Nile fever virus in 2014. In 2019, Piaui was visited by a team of neuroepidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from the United States, because of the positive results of the program. Currently, the Ministry of Health is studying the expansion of surveillance procedures carried out locally to other states of the federation.

According to the neurologist coordinating the program -- Dr Marcelo Adriano, there are already reports of some cases of Guillan-Barré syndrome under temporal relationship with COVID-19 in the world, but this is probably the 1st documented case in which there was detection of specific viral particles in the fluid circulating in the patient's nervous system. While recognizing the importance of this finding, he prefers to remain cautious about attributing the syndrome's cause to the new coronavirus: "Tests are still being carried out for other infectious agents proven to be related to Guillain-Barré syndrome; in addition, studies show that fragments of the virus that are not yet viable can remain detectable for long periods in some parts of the body, but lacking infectivity and aggressive power. He cites the example of the Zika virus, whose fragments can remain detectable for long periods in the semen and urine of infected patients.

Despite this finding, monitoring the surveillance of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the state did not record an increase in the number of cases during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. LACEN-PI will send the cerebrospinal fluid sample to the Reference Laboratory in Respiratory Viruses of the Ministry of Health, for in-depth analyzes that will try to clarify how the virus invaded the patient's nervous system. The Ministry of Health has already been notified of the case.

[Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) is an inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathy associated with numerous viral infections. Simply put, GBS is a neurological autoimmune disease that can lead to respiratory failure and death.

Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19) and GBS, but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. Caress et al reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID‐19 and reported that GBS‐associated COVID‐19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and electrodiagnostic patterns to GBS before the pandemic (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mus.27024). Furthermore, the study data did not indicate a direct viral infection of peripheral nerves as seen with West Nile virus acute flaccid paralysis.

"Research into developing a vaccine against SARS‐COV‐2 is moving at an accelerated rate. Concerns regarding GBS associated with the swine flu vaccine raise questions regarding the risk of GBS with SARS‐COV‐2 vaccines. The 1976 swine influenza vaccine was associated with a slightly increased frequency of GBS, estimated at one additional case of GBS per 100 000 vaccinated persons. However, subsequent studies worldwide have reported varying associations (none, lower, or higher risks) between influenza vaccines other than the 1976 swine influenza vaccine and GBS. However, the estimated risk for GBS after influenza vaccine, based on the few studies that have demonstrated the association, is low: approximately one additional case per million persons vaccinated."

"Studies have also shown an increased risk for GBS after influenza infection, with up to 18% of GBS patients during an influenza outbreak having serological evidence of recent influenza in one study, and substantially greater risks than those associated with vaccination in several others. These numbers, although not generalizable to COVID‐19, may be useful for counselling patients regarding vaccination against SARS‐CoV‐2."

As to finding the virus genome in the CSF of the patient in the report above, "future studies should compare the incidence of GBS associated with COVID‐19 infection with that associated with COVID‐19 vaccination. The potential GBS risk of the vaccine should be weighed against the considerable morbidity and mortality of the infection."

Additionally, "the diagnosis of GBS should be considered in known COVID‐19 patients who develop global weakness during their course as a treatable alternative diagnosis to critical illness neuromyopathy. Most of the reported patients with COVID‐19-associated GBS developed weakness before becoming critically ill, but both diagnostic possibilities should be considered for patients emerging from prolonged ventilation with lucid mental status but profound weakness."

It is also noted that in a small number of patients, "GBS symptoms preceded systemic and respiratory symptoms or occurred during an otherwise asymptomatic COVID‐19 infection. Therefore, testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection should be considered in all patients with suspected GBS during the pandemic and these patients should be isolated, even in the absence of respiratory and systemic symptoms, and until testing has returned negative." - Mod.UBA]

[2] UK: virus 'challenge trials' in COVID-19 vaccine studies
Date: Tue 20 Oct 2020 6:01 PM EDT
Source: Time [edited]
https://time.com/5901961/challenge-trials-uk/


On [20 Oct 2020], researchers at the Imperial College of London announced plans for the 1st human challenge study of COVID-19, which involves deliberately infecting volunteers with the virus that causes the disease, in order to test the effectiveness of vaccines.

The strategy is controversial, as researchers have to weigh the risks of infection against the benefits of learning how well the various vaccine candidates can fight that infection. The strongest argument in favor of the studies has to do with time. If cases of COVID-19 are waning, then the likelihood that people who are vaccinated would get exposed to and potentially infected with the virus naturally declines as well, and it takes researchers longer to accumulate enough data to tell if a vaccine is effective or not. By intentionally exposing people to the virus after they have been vaccinated, researchers can shrink this timeline significantly.

Scientists have used the model to test vaccines against a number of different diseases, including the very 1st one against smallpox -- Edward Jenner infected his son with cowpox, and then exposed his son to smallpox as a way to test his theory that exposure to the former would protect his son from infection by the latter. Scientists tested an H1N1 influenza vaccine by exposing people to the flu, and did the same with a cholera vaccine and the bacterium that causes it. But the strategy requires a solid base of information about both the disease and the vaccine in order to justify the risks. More recently, for example, scientists considered intentionally infecting volunteers with the Zika virus to test vaccines against that disease, but ultimately decided they didn't have enough data to justify the risk.

Adair Richards, honorary associate professor at the University of Warwick who last May [2020] published guidelines on how to ethically conduct human challenge studies, notes that during a pandemic, the risk of delays in developing treatments should be considered alongside the risks to volunteers who are intentionally exposed to disease. "There is a moral weight to inaction as well as action," he says. "There is an unseen risk if we don't do [these studies]. We send a lot of doctors, nurses, and care workers to work every day, and some will get really sick and die of COVID-19 in the next few weeks. [Those] few weeks count -- that's the unseen risk."

More than 38 000 people in the US agree, and have registered their intention to volunteer for challenge studies on 1DaySooner.org, an online recruiting group -- despite the fact that no such studies have been planned in the country yet.

The London-based scientists still need to submit a detailed proposal to regulatory agencies on how they could conduct their study. If the proposal is approved, the team won't start exposing any volunteers until January [2021]. Before that, they will first need to determine what dose of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is safe to give to people but can still produce enough disease to test a vaccine. They will start with the smallest possible dose and work up to one that balances safety with the ability to trigger a proper immune response. The participants will remain under quarantine at a designated facility in London until they test negative for the virus, the researchers said.

From a scientific perspective, infecting people with a known dose of the virus can help researchers be more precise about evaluating and comparing people's immune responses to different vaccines. It will also provide those answers faster than waiting for people to be exposed naturally infected with the disease. "These could almost take the place of phase 3 trials or at least go alongside them," says Richards.

That speed is one reason why the 1DaySooner.org volunteers have supported human challenge trials. "We could know already if some of the major vaccines in phase 3 trials are actually effective," says the movement's founder Josh Morrison, who also co-founded Waitlist Zero, and advocacy group for living organ donors. "It's not to say that we wouldn't still need phase 3 studies, but we would obviously be in a much better position if we could say that when we vaccinate healthy young people with this vaccine and then challenge them with virus, it's 80% effective or 60% effective or 20% effective or not effective at all. It's useful information we could have now but don't have."

Exposing people deliberately to a disease-causing virus, however, would only make sense if the chances of naturally being infected is low, and would delay results of vaccine trials. That's one issue regulators in the UK will likely consider before approving the plan, as daily case numbers there continue to climb. That's also the case in the US, where new infections continue to emerge at high rates in many parts of the country. That's one of the main reasons that Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said earlier this year [2020] that the studies are not ethically justified -- at the time, mid-July [2020], daily case numbers were peaking.

In a [20 Oct 2020] statement to TIME, NIAID officials said the agency is "currently prioritizing randomized controlled clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates. Should there be a need for human challenge studies to fully assess candidate vaccines or therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, NIAID has begun efforts to manufacture a virus strain that could be used to develop a human challenge model, if needed, although human challenge trials would not replace Phase 3 trials."

Any human challenge study has to be done with extreme caution, says Richards. His guidelines include giving people a mandatory period of time to think about their decision to ensure they are making the choice freely and without any duress, and that the risks of infection are conveyed in a straightforward and easily understandable way. Any financial payment should be minimal to cover time away from work and any expenses related to being quarantined for the study, but not large enough to bias people's decisions. "We also want participants to be screened for mental health conditions and cognitive capacity," he says, to ensure that they are making their decision to join the study autonomously.

The Imperial College of London team has yet to detail how its study volunteers will be managed, and what type of informed consent they will provide, but the announcement could change the discussion about the feasibility and utility of human challenge studies. Having studies that compare people's immune responses to different vaccines could be useful in prioritizing which vaccines are manufactured in greater quantities. "Even if every vaccine currently in phase 3 trials works very well, we won't be able to produce enough doses to vaccinate the whole world in 2021," says Morrison. "It's important that we are getting better vaccines and learning from the science and challenge studies are going to be quite useful for that."

[Human challenge trials are trials in which participants are intentionally challenged (whether or not they have been vaccinated) with an infectious disease organism. This challenge organism may be close to wild-type and pathogenic, adapted and/or attenuated from wild-type with less or no pathogenicity, or genetically modified in some manner.

"Challenge studies can be applied to prove microbial pathogenicity, confirm host factors that contribute to the acquisition of infection and the severity of disease, define microbial virulence factors, and identify potential vaccine candidates capable of inducing protective immunity. Perhaps one of the most useful applications of challenge studies, though, is the assessment of preliminary vaccine efficacy. Challenge models can prevent the unnecessary exposure of thousands of human subjects in large phase III field trials by eliminating vaccines that do not demonstrate preliminary evidence of protection. In addition, challenge studies can be used to refine the formulation and schedule of a vaccine that will be further evaluated in field trials.

Results from challenge studies may not always be fully generalizable and careful consideration is needed before extrapolating data obtained from these studies. The challenge population, which has traditionally consisted of healthy adults from developed countries, may have many differences from the population at risk for natural disease," including age group, nutritional status, and other risk factors.

"Another limitation of challenge studies is that they are often designed to assess short-term protection. This may be suitable for vaccines that are being developed for use predominantly in travelers, but may be less applicable when the intent is for use in endemic areas where long-term immunity is the desired goal," as in the current situation with COVID-19. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3904492/)

Last but not the least details such as the challenge dose/experimental infection may differ from natural infection, although the nasal challenge route is being used in the UK trials.

Of course, knowing the COVID-19 transmission dynamics, large field trials in the population are not a viable option... Also, there are associated ethical concerns. Indeed, desperate times call for desperate measures. - Mod.UBA]

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/20/uk-to-start-rapid-covid-19-tests-at-heathrow-on-tuesday-report


Passengers travelling to Hong Kong and Italy from Britain's Heathrow Airport will undergo a one-hour coronavirus test before flying out of the United Kingdom under plans to open up international travel, The Times newspaper reported on Tuesday [20 Oct 2020].

Rapid tests will be introduced from Tuesday at Heathrow Airport in London to allow travellers to enter countries where a negative COVID-19 test result is needed to avoid a lengthy quarantine, the newspaper said.

Passengers are required to book a test in advance at a cost of 80 British pounds (USD 103), the report added.

Aviation services firms Collinson and Swissport have set up rapid-testing facilities for outbound passengers at Heathrow, the newspaper said. The testing facilities will initially be open for 4 weeks and could be extended if there is sufficient demand from passengers, the report added.

Heathrow, Collinson, and Swissport did not immediately respond to the Reuters news agency's requests for comment early on Tuesday.

Airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, and Cathay Pacific are among the first to be offering the facility to passengers using Heathrow's Terminals 2 and 5.

More than 40 million people around the world have now been diagnosed with the coronavirus and there has been a wave of new cases in Europe. Countries like Hong Kong have kept the virus in check with strict border controls and quarantines.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO is now 217 with the addition of Wallis and Futuna with a report on 19 Oct 2020. Weekend decreased reporting continues seen by countries not reporting cases or reported daily numbers significantly reduced, while other countries are reporting a backlog from the reduced weekend reports.

Data by country, area, or territory for 21 Oct 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesOct21_1603369548.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 31.5% of daily case numbers and 33.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 18.9 million cases. The USA maintains its dominance, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Peru and Chile.

- The European region reported 41.6% of daily case numbers and 34.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 8.3 million. Countries not reporting cases today (21 Oct 2020) include Israel, Kazakhstan, and Sweden. The UK is dominant, followed by France, Russia, Italy, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Poland, Ukraine, Romania, and Turkey. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours include Portugal, Armenia, Georgia, Austria, Ireland, and Bulgaria.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.6% of daily case numbers and 11.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.8 million cases. Iran is dominant, followed by Iraq, Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, Lebanon, UAE, and Libya. Kuwait, Pakistan, and the Palestinian Authority each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 while Sudan did not report any cases in the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 3.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.27 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Ethiopia, Kenya, Botswana, Algeria, Angola, Mozambique, Cabo Verde, Uganda, Nigeria, Benin, and Mayotte.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.92% of daily case numbers and 0.48% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.69 million cases. As previously, the Philippines maintains its dominance, followed by Malaysia, Japan, Guam, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 18.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 17.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.6 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Nepal, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: The Americas region has been decreasing in the reports of daily new cases, with the European region reporting the most newly confirmed cases. The Americas region combined with the European region account for almost 2/3 of daily reported deaths.
