A strange disease is reported to have killed 5 people in Rugashali Sub-County, Kibaale district. The deaths have occurred in the last 2 weeks [approx. between 30 Oct 2013 and 13 Nov 2013].

Rugashali Sub-County chairperson, Tumusime Mutebire, singles out Kanyamunya in Yorudani Parish Buyaga West Kibaale District as the most affected village.

Patients develop symptoms of swollen stomach, legs, arms and stomach complications.

[The information is very sparse, but a gastrointestinal infection complicated by kidney failure could be an explanation. It would help to know if there was fever, diarrhea or cutaneous or mucosal bleeding. ProMED will be happy to post further details if available. - Mod.EP
