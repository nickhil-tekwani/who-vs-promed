Eastern Equine Encephalitis has hit the Pee Dee, with an elderly
Marlboro County man becoming the 1st human case this year [2005] of
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in South Carolina.
The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
issued a report on Tuesday [18 Oct 2005] about the incident, with
health officials there saying that, although the disease shares a
similar transmission process to the West Nile Virus, the 2 are quite different.
EEE is usually seen in horses and is relatively rare among people,
said Vicky Zelenka, director of epidemiology at McLeod Regional Medical Center.
"In the past 30 years, perhaps longer, there have only been about 200
cases in the United States," she said. "It's not something we see a
lot of, especially in this area, because it tends to be more
prevalent in Florida and Georgia. I've been in infection control for
32 years, and I've never seen a case of EEE."
The disease is typically characterized by a rapid onset of flu-like
symptoms, such as headache and fever, which left unchecked can result
in a 35 percent likelihood of death.
Although there is a cure for the variety that affects horses, there
is none for humans. [There is no cure for EEE in horses. Most horses
affected with EEE die. A few may recover with good supportive care.

Despite the rarity of EEE, health officials point out that some of
the basic precautions taken for guarding against West Nile can go a long way.
DHEC Commissioner C. Earl Hunter said wearing long sleeves and long
pants when outside and using repellents, such as DEET, can help
reduce the likelihood of contact.
"Continue to look around your home and property, and empty any
standing water from containers," he said. "Be diligent in keeping
your gutters clear of leaves throughout the fall. Screens on porches
and windows should be used to keep mosquitoes from getting into your
home on mild autumn days."
There has been an increase this year [2005] in confirmed cases of EEE
in animals and mosquitoes in South Carolina, specifically, in 16
horses, one bird and 2 mosquito pools, said Chris Evans, a DHEC entomologist.

[The Pee Dee in South Carolina is a region and refers to a river that
is about 425 miles long.
Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus is a member of the family
_Togaviridae_, genus _Alphavirus_, and is closely related to Western
and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses.
EEE virus is transmitted to horses and to humans through the bite of
an infected mosquito. Horses can become infected with and die from
EEE virus infection, as can humans.
However, the primary EEE transmission cycle is between birds and mosquitoes.
Several species of mosquitoes can become infected with EEE virus. The
most important mosquito in maintaining the enzootic (animal-based, in
this case bird-mosquito-bird) transmission cycle is _Culiseta melanura_.
The enzootic (animal-based) transmission cycle is most common to
coastal areas and freshwater swamps. Human cases occur relatively
infrequently, largely because the primary transmission cycle takes
place in swamp areas where populations tend to be limited.
States with the largest number of cases are Florida, Georgia,
Massachusetts, and New Jersey.
Approximately 35 percent of people who survive EEE are left with
neurological deficits.
There have been approximately 200 confirmed cases in the US between
1964 and the present. There are an average of 4 cases per year, with
a range from 0 to 14 cases.
