37th Epidemiological Week, 11-17 Sep 2005 [in Spanish, trans. JGM, edited]

Up to [17 Sep] 2005, 3 cases of yellow fever have been reported, one in the
17th epidemiological week [24-30 Apr 2005], and the other 2 in the 20th
week [15-21 May 2005]. All cases were from Merida State.
Up to the 38th Epidemiological Week of 2005, 446 suspected cases have been
registered, and only [these] 3 cases of yellow fever have been confirmed.
In the remaining 396 cases, 296 do not have a definite diagnosis yet, 17
were dengue fever, 79 were hepatitis A, 8 were hepatitis B, 33 were
leptospirosis, and there are 44 pending results.
When reviewing the epidemiological curve, there are 2 peaks for cases
investigated, which correspond to epizootics reported by this agency and to
the great number of cases studied during the leptospirosis outbreak that
affected some Venezuelan states, including Carabobo, Miranda, & Aragua.

[Venezuela does well to report all suspected cases of YF as required by the
International Health Regulations, even though most turn out to be something
else upon laboratory testing. The previous report on ProMED of human cases
from Merida state was in September 2004, but in 2005 YF activity in monkeys
was reported from Apure, Monagas, and Sucre states -- see refs. below and
map at <http://www.orinocoev.de/jpg/ve-map2.jpg>.
Merida state is close to Lake Maracaibo in the west of the country,
bordering Colombia; Apure state is at the headwaters of the Orinoco river;
Monagas state is north of the Orinoco delta, and Sucre state is on the
Caribbean coast -- transmission there threatens the Caribbean islands of
Trinidad & Tobago.
In 1999 an unvaccinated man traveling in Bolivar state fell ill and died of
YF after returning to Califonia, USA -- see refs. below. - Mod.JW]
