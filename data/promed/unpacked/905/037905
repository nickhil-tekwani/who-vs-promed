Ebola virus disease -- Democratic Republic of Congo
---------------------------------------------------
Epidemiology and surveillance
-----------------------------
On 26 Aug 2014, the Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) notified the World Health Organization (WHO) of an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Equateur Province.

The index case was a pregnant woman from Ikanamongo Village who butchered a bush animal that had been killed and given to her by her husband. She became ill with symptoms of EVD and reported to a private clinic in Isaka Village. On 11 Aug 2014, she died of a then-unidentified haemorrhagic fever. Local customs and rituals associated with death meant that several health-care workers were exposed and presented with similar symptoms in the following week.

Between 28 Jul-18 Aug 2014, a total of 24 suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever, including 13 deaths, have been identified. Human-to-human transmission has been established and includes the health-care personnel who were exposed to the deceased pregnant woman during surgery (1 doctor and 2 nurses) in addition to the hygienist and a ward boy, all of whom developed symptoms and died. Other deaths have been recorded among the relatives who attended the index case, individuals who were in contact with the clinic staff, and those who handled the bodies of the deceased during funerals. The other 11 cases are currently being treated in isolation centres.

Samples have been sent to laboratories in Kinshasa and in Gabon for confirmation of EVD and to identify the strain. The index case and the 80 contacts have no history of travel to the EVD-affected countries in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, or Sierra Leone) or history of contact with individuals from the affected areas. At this time, it is believed that the outbreak in DRC is unrelated to the ongoing outbreak in west Africa.

Health sector response
----------------------
The Ministry of Health of DRC has dispatched field teams to the area to monitor and evaluate the situation. Contact tracing has begun and 80 individuals are currently being followed-up. Treatment of patients is ongoing and infection prevention and control measures are in place and are being supported by WHO with the delivery of personal protective equipment to the area.

WHO is currently monitoring the situation with the Government of DRC and awaiting confirmation of the disease strain from the laboratories. A rapid response team is poised to deploy and assist DRC, if needed. This is the 7th outbreak of EVD in the former Zaire/present DRC since 1976.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied except in cases where individuals have been confirmed or are suspected of being infected with EVD or where individuals have had contact with cases of EVD. (Contacts do not include properly-protected health-care workers and laboratory staff.)

[2] CIDRAP comments

[CIDRAP comments:]

The 24 suspected cases and 13 deaths reported by the WHO match up with numbers given by DRC Health Minister Felix Kabange Numbi on 24 Aug 2014, as reported by the media.

The WHO said samples have been sent to laboratories in Kinshasa (the DRC capital) and Gabon to confirm EVD and identify the strain, and results were still being awaited.

The 11 surviving patients were being treated in isolation centers, the agency reported. Meanwhile, the DRC has sent field teams to the area to evaluate the situation, and 80 contacts of the sick and deceased are being monitored.

A WHO rapid response team is ready to deploy and help the DRC if needed, the statement said.

The agency did not mention anything about earlier reports of 70 deaths in the outbreak area, the Boende region. Last week the WHO said those deaths were caused by hemorrhagic gastroenteritis unrelated to EVD, but on 24 Aug 2014, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said that that conclusion had been based on premature information and that samples had tested positive for EVD in a DRC lab.

Today [27 Aug 2014] the United Nations mission in the DRC said the UN has allocated USD 1.5 million to help the country fight the outbreak, according to an Agence France-Presse (AFP) report. The amount, which comes from a fund for humanitarian needs, could double in the near future, the story said.

The current outbreak is the 7th in the DRC since EVD was discovered there in 1976.

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)'s Health Minister Felix Kabange Numbi told Xinhua on Wednesday [27 Aug 2014] that 6 cases of the Ebola virus [disease] that has plagued the province of Equateur were confirmed by laboratory tests.

"Statistics updated the field: the total number of cases reported since the beginning is 42, and 6 cases confirmed by laboratory, 13 probable and 23 suspect cases," said Kabange.

"The number of deaths is still 13, [of] which 5 [were] health workers. 11 people are in isolation, 6 new samples were done outside of the 8 already analyzed. 168 contacts are identified and monitored," said the minister.

According to the minutes of a cabinet meeting chaired Tuesday [26 Aug 2014] by President Joseph Kabila, "the president also instructed the government to mobilize the budgetary resources provided against the response to this epidemic."

Kabila has urged the government to make available to scientists and researchers the Congolese substantial resources to accelerate the development of a vaccine against this disease.

[24 suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) are noted, including 13 deaths. The index case, who became ill presumably on 28 Jul 2014 and died on 11 Aug 2014, is reported as having had exposure to bush meat, though the animal species involved and the exact nature of the exposure (hunting, butchering, cooking, consuming, etc.) are not noted. The remainder of the cases are reported to have been in contact with this index case either in the healthcare setting or elsewhere. The virus is said to be undergoing laboratory testing for strain designation, though prior reports indicated the Zaire strain of the virus. - Mod.LM
