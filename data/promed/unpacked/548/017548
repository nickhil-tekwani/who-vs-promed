California dairy herd slaughtered after TB outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
A dairy farmer has been paid by the federal government to slaughter his
herd of 6400 cows after an outbreak of bovine tuberculosis (TB). The herd
was euthanized to protect the state's status of being free of bovine TB.
"If you didn't depopulate, the whole state would lose its whole TB-free
status, and that would have an impact," said Larry Hawkins, a US Department
of Agriculture (USDA) spokesman.
A cow at a nearby dairy also tested positive for the disease last week. A
second outbreak would jeopardize the TB-free status and require costly
statewide testing. Michigan, with a much smaller herd, expects to spend
$120 million over a decade fighting the disease after an outbreak in 1997.
Losing the status would also make it more difficult for farms in
California, the nation's largest dairy producer, to sell cattle to
neighboring states.
The bovine TB outbreak was discovered in May at Friesian Dairy after a
federal meat inspector found traces of the bacteria at a Hanford meat
packing plant. The disease was linked to a particular where 90 cows tested
positive. Agriculture officials don't know how the outbreak occurred.

[Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious zoonotic disease caused by
_Mycobacterium bovis_. In bovines, it is usually characterized by formation
of nodular granulomas known as tubercles. Although commonly defined as a
chronic debilitating disease, bovine TB can occasionally assume an acute,
rapidly progressive course. Any body tissue can be affected, but lesions
are most frequently observed in the lymph nodes, lungs, intestines, liver,
spleen, pleura, and peritoneum.
_M. bovis_ has been identified in humans in most countries where isolates
of mycobacteria from human patients have been fully typed. The incidence of
pulmonary TB caused by _M. bovis_ is higher in farm and slaughterhouse
workers than in urban inhabitants. One of the results of bovine TB
eradication programs has been a reduction in disease and death from TB
among the human population. Pasteurization of milk and improved sanitation
have also been of great importance.
Cattle are considered to be the true hosts of _M. bovis_, but the disease
has been reported in several other species of domestic and wild animals.
Isolations have been made from buffalo, bison, sheep, goats, equines,
camels, pigs, deer, antelopes, dogs, cats, foxes, mink, badgers, ferrets,
rats, primates, llamas, kudus, elands, tapirs, elks, elephants, sitatungas
[wild bovines], oryxes, addaxes [these last 2 are antelopes], rhinoceroses,
possums, ground squirrels, otters, seals, hares, moles, raccoons, coyotes,
and several predatory felines including lions, tigers, leopards, and lynx.
The rigorous application of tuberculin testing and culling of reactor
cattle has eliminated _M. bovis_ infection from farmed bovine populations
of some countries, but this strategy has not been universally successful.
Extensive investigations of sporadic _M. bovis_ recurrence have shown that
wildlife reservoirs exist in some countries. - Mod.TG]
