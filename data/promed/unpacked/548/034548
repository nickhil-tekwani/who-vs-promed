RABIES, POST-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS

Clinical guidelines for pre-exposure rabies vaccine booster immunizations.
Health care providers commonly recommend pre-exposure rabies vaccine to
persons who will be at increased risk for rabies exposure. This includes
veterinarians and others with occupational exposures, but more frequently
is applied to tourist or long-term residents to areas where rabies is
endemic (risk predominantly being from canine populations). Clinicians need
to know how long protective immunity persists after a pre-exposure series
of three (days 0, 7, and 21 or 28) intramuscular rabies vaccines (Human
Diploid Cell Vaccine -HDCV, Rabies Vaccine Absorbed - RVA, or Purified
Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine Adsorbed - PCEC).
If a bite or lick exposure occurs within three years of a pre-exposure
series, established guidelines recommend two post-exposure boosters with
one of the above vaccines (rabies immune globulin - RIG - not required).
Beyond three years there is confusion. In the past a single rabies booster
immunization was recommended every three years for travelers. When a
delayed hypersensitivity reaction began to be reported in as many as 5
percent of booster recipients, some clinicians began to recommend yearly
rabies antibody titers as a guide of when to booster (i.e. attempting to
lengthen the interval between pre-exposure boosters). This is expensive,
labor intensive, and often impractical.
In personal communications some "rabies authorities" have suggested that
current generation vaccines have such effective immunogenicity that
reliable post-exposure protection is provided by boosting with two
intramuscular vaccines (without RIG) for as long as ten years following the
initial pre-exposure (three injection) series. The clinical dilemma is: how
to manage the person who has an exposure to rabies, and had a documented
(intramuscular) pre-exposure immunization series four or more years
earlier? Does this person require: 1) a five-injection series of rabies
vaccine, 2) a five-injection series of rabies vaccine plus RIG, or 3) two
post-exposure boosters?
Considering the consequences of inadequate rabies prevention, most
clinicians probably over treat. However, considering that it has been over
20 years since HDCV became available, some data should be available to
assist clinical decision-making. Specifically, has anyone collected data
showing decays of rabies titers after three pre-exposure injections, and is
there data on post-booster titer responses for boosters given at variable
times (4-10 years) after a pre-exposure series?
