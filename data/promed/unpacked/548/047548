Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Vector control measures have been strengthened. Surveillance of wild ruminants has been strengthened, and no cases have been detected.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied, domestic: control of vectors, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, vector surveillance

Control measures applied, wild: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type /Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institut de la recherche veterinaire, Tunis (national laboratory) / cattle / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 25 Sep to 10 Oct 2021 / positive
Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), G. Caporale, Abruzzo and Molise (OIE reference laboratory) / cattle / gene sequencing / [results pending]

[The following information comes from the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2021, Chapter 3.1.7 "Epizootic haemorrhagic disease" (NB: version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2021). For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to this chapter [link below].

"Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is a vector-borne infectious noncontagious viral disease of domestic and wild ruminants, primarily white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) and cattle. Sheep, goats, and camelids might also be susceptible, but usually do not develop overt disease.

"EHD virus (EHDV) is transmitted between ruminant hosts by species of _Culicoides_ biting midges, thus EHD infections are strongly seasonal. White-tailed deer is the most severely affected species, with the peracute form having a high mortality rate. In cattle, clinical signs occur rarely but fever, anorexia, dysphagia, emaciation, ulcerative stomatitis, lameness, respiratory distress and erythema of the udder have been reported."

"The EHDV has been isolated from wild and domestic ruminants and arthropods in North America, Ecuador, the Caribbean region, French Guiana, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and more recently in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Basin including Algeria, Israel, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. No cases of EHDV infection have been reported in Europe. Outbreaks generally coincide with the peak of vector population abundance, so most cases of EHD occur in the late summer and autumn."
(https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.07_EHD.pdf)

According to the OIE guideline, EHD should be reported as "an emerging disease." In this report, the reason was reported as "recurrence," probably because in 2006 and 2015, Tunisia had already reported this disease.

The extent of this event in the country and surrounding bordering countries will depend on the extent of the distribution of the competent vector. - Mod.CRD
