The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services and CDC are
investigating a national outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Oranienburg infections. At this time, most of the cases have occurred
in people with connections to health care facilities, including
several cases in patients who had been hospitalized for several days
before the organism was recovered. In most cases, the organism has
been recovered from stool, but some patients have had the organism
recovered from blood or urine. Clinicians should consider _S._
Oranienburg as a potential cause of healthcare-associated diarrhea if
routine evaluations are unrevealing. _S._ Oranienburg can be
diagnosed by stool culture.
If you encounter cases of _S._ Oranienburg, we would appreciate your
reporting them to your state or local health department or to David
Blossom at the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion at CDC
<dblossom@cdc.gov>.

[ProMED is happy to comply with CDC's request to publish this alert
asking for information on more cases. - Mod.JW]
[Serotype Oranienburg is not common but was the cause of a large
outbreak (more than 1500 people) associated with cuttlefish chips in
Japan in 1998-99 (Kumao T, Ba-Thein W, Hayashi H: Molecular subtyping
methods for detection of Salmonella enterica serovar Oranienburg
outbreaks. J Clin Microbiol. 2002; 40: 2057-61) as well as an
outbreak associated with ice cream in Australia (see below).
The possible association with health care is worrisome. More
information is likely to be forthcoming regarding distribution and
possible acquisition links. - Mod.LL]
