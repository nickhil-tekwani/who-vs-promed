incidence of Lyme disease in the Donetsk region has increased by 77
percent this year [2008] if compared to the same period last year
[2007]. The number of cases was 32 and all were confirmed to be

Abstract:
Cases of human Lyme borreliosis (LB) are registered in all
administrative regions of Ukraine and in the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea with an increasing tendency. The hard tick Ixodes ricinus was
proved as the main vector of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., the causative
agents of LB. We identified active natural LB foci, in which almost
25% of the adult I. ricinus ticks contained borrelias and more than
30% of the human population were seropositive for Lyme borreliae. The
role of Mus musculus, Microtus arvalis, Myodes glareolus, Apodemus
agrarius, and A. sylvaticus in the transmission cycle of the LB
agent(s) was revealed. Combined foci and cases of LB/TBE (tick-borne
encephalitis) mixed infection were registered in 8 oblasts. A
considerable spectrum of different clinical manifestations of LB has
been found including erythema migrans [red patches on the skin that
move around] in 64.9 percent of cases, neurologic symptoms in 26.1
percent, rheumatic affliction in 24.7 percent, and cardiovascular
problems in 8.3 percent.
