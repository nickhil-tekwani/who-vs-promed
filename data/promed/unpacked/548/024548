Further to my earlier mail, I got this information from the Ondersterpoort
Veterinary Institute as per the samples we sent from Nigeria:
"The samples numbered 1-10 tested negative for African Swine Fever (ASF) on
virus isolation as well as Polyerace Chain Reaction (PCR). Only samples
12-15 were positive (12-15 on PCR and 12-13 on virus isolation)."
