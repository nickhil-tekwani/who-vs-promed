-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In July 2020, 10% of 2600 9-year-old almond trees in Sanliurfa province showed symptoms of yellowing, gumming, branch and trunk cankers, and dieback. Infected wood tissue exhibited visible internal necrosis.

Two of the fungal isolates obtained from infected samples were analysed by microscopy for their morphology. PCR tests specific to 2 _L. theobromae_ genes resulted in amplicons with 99% and 100% sequence similarity to type strains of the fungus in the GenBank database. Pathogenicity of each isolate was verified on 10 one-year-old _P. dulcis_ seedlings. Control seedlings remained symptomless.

In California, a similar canker disease of almond caused by _L. theobromae_ has been reported. This is the 1st report of this fungus causing dieback on almond in Turkey.

[The fungus _Lasiodiplodia theobromae_ was 1st reported in Cameroon in 1895 associated with charcoal pod rot of cocoa. Subsequently it was found to have a wide host range of more than 280 species including many crops such as citrus, grapevine, vegetable hosts, strawberry, sweet potato, and mango. Depending on the host, symptoms may include wilting, fruit rots, dieback, vascular discolouration, complete defoliation, and death of plants. It is thought that nutrient deficiencies and environmental stress factors may enhance the susceptibility of some hosts. Fungicides may be helpful in disease management if applied quickly enough.

An increase in virulence has been reported on some hosts, suggesting that new strains of the fungus may be emerging in different areas. Lasiodiplodia dieback of blueberry was recently reported for the 1st time in Europe from Spain (ProMED post 20190912.6671449). However, it is not clear whether this was due to a new strain or an introduction of the blueberry pathogen from the Americas or Asia.
