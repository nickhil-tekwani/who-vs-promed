Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Cumulatively, 14.7 percent of total males are MSM (men who have sex with men); 2.9 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.7 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total of cases continues to increase, although at a lower rate, and in numbers and fatalities has altogether surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak.

Since 1 Jan 2017, Utah public health has identified 256 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

Since November 2017, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has identified an increase of hepatitis A cases in southern Indiana, many of which are tied to a large outbreak in Louisville, Kentucky. Indiana has an average of 20 cases of hepatitis A per year.

Cases have been confirmed in several counties, with the majority being reported in Clark and Floyd counties. The genotype of 2 of these cases matches that of ongoing outbreaks in Arizona, Kentucky, California, Michigan and Utah. Transmission is presumed to occur person-to-person and through injection drug use; no commercial food product has been identified as being contaminated. Based on current information, populations who are homeless, transient or incarcerated or use illicit drugs are considered at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis A.

If you believe you have been exposed to hepatitis A or are homeless, use injection or non-injection drugs, were recently incarcerated, or had contact with someone who has hepatitis A, contact your health care provider about hepatitis A vaccine.

To reduce the risk of hepatitis A transmission, people who have not received 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine may ask their healthcare provider for protection. Additionally, always wash your hands with soap and warm water after going to the bathroom, after changing diapers, and before preparing meals for yourself and others.

[The key to controlling these outbreaks revolves around changing the paradigm of HAV prevention. In addition to vaccination of critical cohorts such as food service workers, addressing the homeless and providing appropriate care for drug users are useful interventions.
