Brioche poisoned 30 people in Djelfa
------------------------------------
The Services of Trade and Prevention, for Neighborhood Health and Security in the city of Aïn Oussera, state of Djelfa, recorded an incident of foodborne illness yesterday evening [17 Apr 2022], which affected more than 30 people.

The Services have taken urgent measures requiring the immediate closure of a bakery. The bakery sells stuffed brioche, which is likely to be the reason behind the incident of dozens of cases of illness after eating it.

A reliable source revealed to Ennahar Online, that several health facilities in the city, including the hospital and 3 halls of multiple health services, have received more than 30 cases of foodborne illness due to consumption of brioche pastry pies bought from a bakery downtown.

Most of the cases have been taken care of and they were discharged from the health facilities that night, except a young girl who is still undergoing treatment and is in good condition.

In the course of the investigations, samples of the stuffed bread were also taken from the bakery and the Trade Services sent a sample to the laboratory in Djelfa.

[Little information regarding the illnesses per se is given but it is likely that the incubation period was short and staphylococcal enterotoxin was the cause of the illness.

A non-febrile illness primarily with vomiting is suggestive of staphylococcal enterotoxin-associated illness where foods are not adequately handled and _Staphylococcus aureus_ is allowed to grow and produce toxin. A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than one hour) also suggests that the etiology might have been heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes, including a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc; vomiting and diarrhea for tin; and blue or green vomitus for copper. Other chemical toxins can also produce this syndrome of illness. - Mod.LL
