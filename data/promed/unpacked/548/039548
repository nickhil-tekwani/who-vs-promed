A tetanus outbreak among injecting drug users is suspected of killing
1 woman and causing illness in 5 others.
Public health officials yesterday said more cases were expected. Most
of the women are in their 20s. 5 of the cases have occurred in the
last 2 weeks, in northwest England, the West Midlands, and the
southwest. The 6th case dates from Jul 2003 and it is not known
whether it is linked.
Tetanus normally affects just a handful of Britons each year --
mainly older women infected by contaminated soil while gardening. Of
175 tetanus cases identified between 1984 and 2000, only 2 have
previously been known to have been injecting drug users.
Urgent warnings are being sent to drug action teams and hospitals, as
quick treatment can be life-saving.

[Tetanus is an intoxication related to local infection -- usually in
a wound -- with the vegetative form of _Clostridium tetani_. The
organism is a Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic, Gram-positive,
spore-forming rod. Immunization with a toxoid ought o prevent the
disease, but waning immunity and/or increased immigration of
nonimmunized or inadequately immunized individuals represent a
significant cause of cases in developed nations. The immunization
status of these young women is not stated. Punctures and lacerations
account for most of the introduction sites, but in injecting drug
users, an obvious focus may not be obvious. - Mod.LL]
