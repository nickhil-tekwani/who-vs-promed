At least 15 persons, including 5 children, have been affected by jaundice in Lukapada village under Bangomunda block of [Bolangir] district [Odisha].

The tribal dominated village has 167 households. Villagers have alleged negligence by the district administration and lack of medical facilities as the reasons behind the spread of the water-borne disease. Citing that the village is jaundice prone, a villager demanded immediate medical help and electricity facilities in the village.

Bolangir Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) Rabinarayan Tripathy said a medical team will be sent to Lukapada village soon to take stock of the situation. The source of water to the village will also be tested and necessary medical support provided, he added.
