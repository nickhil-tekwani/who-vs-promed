Epidemiological update - Cholera, 15 Nov 2022
--------------------------------------------

Summary of the current situation:
Haiti
-----
Since the notification of the first 2 confirmed cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 in the greater Port-au-Prince area on 2 Oct 2022 to 13 Nov 2022, the Haitian Ministry of Health (Ministère de la Santé Publique et de la Population, MSPP per its French acronym) reported a total of 9076 suspected cases in 8 departments of the country, including 816 confirmed cases, 7623 hospitalized suspected cases, and 175 registered deaths. This represents an increase of 33% in suspected cases (n = 2262), 25% in confirmed cases (n = 163) and 22% in deaths (n = 31) compared with the update of 8 Nov 2022.

To date, 4 departments have confirmed cases (Artibonite, Centre, Grand-Anse and Ouest). As of 13 Nov 2022, the case fatality rate among suspected cases is 2%. Of a total of 2019 samples analyzed by the National Public Health Laboratory (LNSP for its acronym in French), 639 were confirmed (40.4% positivity rate).

Of the total reported suspected cases with available information, 60% are male and 46% are aged 19 years or younger. The most affected age group is 1- to 4-year-olds, followed by 20- to 29-year-olds and 30- to 39-year-olds (Figure 2 [for figures, see source URL. - Mod.LL]). Among confirmed cases with available age and sex information, 43% are aged 19 years or younger. The most affected age-group is 1- to 4-year-olds, followed by 30- to 39-year-olds (Figure 3).

The Ouest Department continues to report the highest number of cases, with 93% of all suspected cases recorded (excluding the 368 suspected cases from the Port-au-Prince prison). The communes of Cité-Soleil and Port-au-Prince account for 62% of all suspected cases reported in the Ouest Department (Figure 4). In the series of maps below you can observe how the geographical dispersion of the accumulated suspected cases is, according to each epidemiological week (Figure 5). In the Port-au-Prince prison, an outbreak of cholera has been registered that has identified 368 suspected cases to date, including 14 confirmed cases and 14 deaths.

The complex humanitarian and security crisis, added to the limited access to fuel throughout the country, continues, so access to health services and laboratories is limited and, therefore, epidemiological surveillance is affected.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) is working in coordination with the Haitian public health authorities to characterize this event and support the response.

Dominican Republic
------------------
On 20 Oct 2022, the Dominican Republic Ministry of Public Health confirmed the 1st imported case of cholera in the country. This is a 32-year-old woman of Haitian nationality who entered the Dominican Republic on 17 Oct 2022 from Port-au-Prince and then traveled to the province of La Altagracia. For now, none of the contacts have presented symptoms and no additional confirmed cases have been reported. The Ministry's press release is available at https://bit.ly/3DhfERG.

Guidance for national authorities
---------------------------------
PAHO/WHO recommends that Member States continue their efforts to strengthen and maintain cholera surveillance in order to detect suspected cases early, provide adequate treatment and prevent its spread. Early and adequate treatment maintains the case fatality rate (CFR) of hospitalized patients at less than 1%.

PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to simultaneously continue their efforts to guarantee adequate basic sanitation conditions and access to drinking water, in addition to hygiene promotion and social mobilization, in order to reduce the impact of cholera and other waterborne diseases. PAHO/WHO reiterates that Member States continue implementing the recommendations formulated in the Epidemiological Update of 1 Nov 2022, available at https://bit.ly/3WFqdpf, which remain valid.

[In the wake of the devastation caused by the earthquake on 12 Jan 2010 that centered about 10 miles (approx. 15 km) southwest of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, cholera erupted prominently with more than 750 000 cases and almost 10 000 deaths. After several years, the numbered of cases lessened but flared in times of stress, including hurricanes.

The social and economic crises have continued and along with gang violence, a resurgence of the waterborne scourge has recurred. ProMED awaits more information regarding this cluster. It will be interesting to see how closely the newly found bacteria are related to the previous outbreak strain. - Mod.LL
