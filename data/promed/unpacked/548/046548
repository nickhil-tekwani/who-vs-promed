Departmental Health Services (El Servicio Departamental de Salud; SEDES) reported 30 positive canine rabies cases so far this year [2012]; 19 of these were registered in the rural area and 11 in the urban area. Health authorities are preparing a vaccination campaign for 9-10 Jun [2012].

The official responsible for the rabies zoonoses program, Johnny Ruiz, stated that the canine population in Santa Cruz [department; state equivalent] is around 713 759 (including cats, dogs and monkeys); the urban area has 414 750 and the rural area has registered 299 099 animals.

Ruiz stated that rabies incidence is 0.42 per 10 000 canine population and in the provinces reaches 0.62 for the same canine population. "We are working on a massive campaign to immunize nearly 500 000 dogs in the eastern region." [he said].

According to the program official, brigades of 1200 people will be formed in order to immunize [dogs] in the neighborhoods and assistance centers that will be enabled for that day.

According to the SEDES report, the Warnes municipality registered 10 positive cases, that is one of the rural areas with greatest incidence, followed by Montero, Porongo and El Torno, which have 2 confirmed cases in the region, whereas La Guardia, Yapacani and San Ramon each has reported one positive [case].

[The Santa Cruz department has had ongoing canine rabies problems over the past 3 months. It is not clear why the vaccination campaign is not scheduled until June -- 2 months in the future. Nor is the number of street (un-owned) dogs versus owned dogs stated in the above report. A public education campaign urging pet owners to vaccinate their animals against rabies would be helpful to reduce the risk of transmission of rabies virus to humans.
