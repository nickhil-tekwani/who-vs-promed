Info Region contacted Claudio Villagra, Environmental Coordinator
General of the Almirante Brown Partido [an administrative subdivision
of the Province of Buenos Aires. - Mod.TY], concerning 3 people
infected with hantavirus in recent months in the district. Villagra
assured [Info Region] that these were isolated cases -- useful to
make people aware of the importance of prevention --, and that
control [measures] had been timely.
In December [2006], [officials] became aware of 2 people infected,
one in Ministro Rivadavia and the other in the Don Orione
neighborhood in Claypole [both localities in Almirante Brown]. In
January [2006] there was a 3rd case, a 59-year-old woman also from
Don Orione, who was admitted to the Lucio Melendez de Adrogue
Hospital and released a few days later.
The Secretary of Health, Cesar Garcia, assured everyone that "we are
carrying out preventive measures [such as] rodent control,
distribution of [rodent] baits, dealing with problems, and giving
talks to [citizens] development groups".
During December 2006, one of the affected [individuals] was a
17-year-old from Bolivia who had recently arrived in the country
[Argentina] to visit relatives. "We presume that the infection was
acquired in his home area, since the countries that border
[Argentina], Bolivia and Paraguay, have frequent cases [of hantavirus
infection]. This can affect areas along our international borders,
which is why we want to act in this province".
The long-tailed pygmy rice rat, [_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_], is
the reservoir [of the virus].

[It would be useful to know if any of the cases suffered
cardiopulmonary disease or were just febrile, and if the
hantavirus(es) involved was (were) identified.
