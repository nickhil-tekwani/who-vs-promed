[Human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) has increased from 12 deaths of 22 cases on 26 Sep 2022 (see Rift Valley fever - Mauritania (06): human, livestock 20220928.8705845) to 17 deaths of 28 cases given in the above report. The number of confirmed livestock cases has also increased from 231 cases in 7 wilayat (regions) to 264 confirmed cases, also in 7 wilayas. All affected animals are reported as camels. The number of human cases of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever remains low at 2.

People in the affected areas need to be aware of the risk of handling infected animals, including their slaughtering and processing, as well as fresh animal products (uncooked meat and crude milk). RVF virus can also be mosquito-transmitted. However, vector control over this large geographic area would be difficult. There is no vaccine available for humans. - Mod.TY
