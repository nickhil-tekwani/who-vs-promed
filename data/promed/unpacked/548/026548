An alert has been announced because of a new outbreak of (paralytic) rabies in a field in Santo Tome.

The outbreak occurred in a farm in La Escondida area, where 6 animals died because of this bat-borne disease. Santo Tome municipality has already started immunization of pets. Today [13 Jan 2012], cattle in the neighboring areas will be immunized.

13 500 animals susceptible for developing rabies will be vaccinated in the area (around the index cases) delineated by the National Agrarian Sanitation Service (SENASA, according to its Spanish initials).

A new outbreak of paralytic rabies occurred in a farm in Santo Tome Department, where the disease has already killed 6 head of cattle. Vaccination activities will start today [13 Jan 2012], including field animals, rural families, and pets. Mr. Victor Giraud, Intendent of Santo Tome, reported the current situation to Dr. Juan Manzur, Ministry of Health, who is now visiting Misiones province, and he gave assurances that his office will support every action taken in order to eradicate the (vampire) bat vector.

Santo Tome municipality reported they ordered the local Health and Environment Secretariat to urgently vaccinate all dogs and cats in the community, and also to control their populations, in order to prevent the spread of (paralytic) rabies recently detected in a farm.

As was reported in Santo Tome's main city, the (index) case is located 35 km (22 miles) to the north, going by the N14 National Highway in La Escondida community of Gobernador Virasoro municipality. A team of healthcare workers arrived there, and they visited different areas in Santo Tome department. They immunized pets, and they also fumigated both households and their surrounding areas.

The Sanitary Area of Santo Tome municipality confirmed that in La Escondida community, 6 head of cattle died because of (paralytic) rabies. No cases of rabies were detected in the following communities: Tarairi, Santa Catalina, Cambuireta, Estancia Los Tres Pinos, and Estancia La Providencia. All dogs living in these communities were also vaccinated. Healthcare personnel will vaccinate families living in these communities, but there was no information from the local health authority with respect to when these vaccinations would take place.

Mr. Juan Martin Hid-Sehman, Head of Corrientes Foundation for Animal Sanitation (FUCOSA, according to its Spanish initials), declared to this newspaper (El Litoral) that this institution is acting in peripheral areas, while SENASA is currently working in the main affected areas. Consequently, personnel from FUCOSA will vaccinate 13 500 animals; 3000 of them belong to small (family) farms, and the Ministry of Production will supply them with the vaccines.

Santo Tome municipality reported that the Intendent, Mr. Victor Giraud, communicated with the Minister of Health, Dr. Juan Manzur, who is currently visiting Misiones province, in order to inform him about this situation and to look for a prompt solution so this condition may not disseminate to other areas.

It is worth mentioning that in early April 2011, some cases were detected in other rural areas, so Santo Tome municipality issued a decree declaring a sanitary emergency because of the occurrence of (paralytic) rabies cases.

At that time, a wide immunization campaign was implemented for people living in affected rural areas and in the surroundings, as is the case now, and SENASA authorities implemented mandatory emergency vaccination, and they ordered that cattle from 15 affected farms had to be immobilized, including nearly 25 000 head.

[Rabies vaccination for this number of people is a serious undertaking. It is unclear whether they are proposing to administer a regular vaccine or post-exposure prophylaxis. These injections carry some risk.

Vampire bats are distributed in tropical areas of the western hemisphere from Argentina to Mexico and have been responsible for transmitting rabies virus most frequently to cattle and equine animals and infrequently to humans [by bite]. Of the 3 vampire bat species, _Desmodus rotundus_ is by far the most common rabies virus transmitter.

There are 2 options for rabies control in these situations: vaccination of animals upon which the vampire bats feed, or reduction of the vampire bat populations, or a combination of the 2 approaches. Eliminating vampire bat hosts is the fastest and most effective approach when vampire bat-transmitted rabies appears in an area. In areas where repeated vampire bat-transmitted rabies occurs, control of these bats has been employed in some countries. Controlling vampire bats by eliminating their roosts is extremely difficult, because these roosts can be hard to find. Effective vampire bat control has been accomplished by capturing bats in mist nets when they come to feed on livestock, and applying anticoagulant jelly (warfarin and similar products), which they and their roost-mates ingest on grooming.

Clinical signs of rabies in cattle may include evidence of neurological disease, loss of coordination (especially in hind legs), excessive salivation, anorexia, tenesmus, ataxia, drowsiness, dyspnea, aggressiveness, and in some cases, diarrhea and pneumonia. Rabies is preventable in cattle with a vaccine.

The paralytic form of rabies is 1st manifested by paralysis of the throat and masseter muscles, often with profuse salivation and inability to swallow. Dropping of the lower jaw is common in dogs. Owners frequently examine the mouth of dogs and livestock searching for a foreign body or administer medication with their bare hands, thereby exposing themselves to rabies. These animals may not be vicious and rarely attempt to bite. The paralysis progresses rapidly to all parts of the body, and coma and death follow in a few hours. The latter is very much what seems to be happening with the livestock described above.

Rabies is known to be transmitted by the "bite" of the vampire bat because the virus resides in the saliva. Rabies is identified through testing of the brain of a deceased animal.

Rabies can pass from bovines to people, but the animal must bite the person, or the person must have contact with saliva of the animal and it must enter the human body through a cut, scratch, the mucus membranes of the eye, the nose, or the mouth. Casual contact will not infect the person. The bovines usually have a distinctive bellow when they are infected with rabies. Although this is not a diagnostic quality, it is unusual enough that many veterinarians recognize it. Nevertheless, consumption of diseased animals is not recommended.
