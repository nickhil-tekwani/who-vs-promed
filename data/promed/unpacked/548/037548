China: toxic spill forces water supplies to be cut
--------------------------------------------------
A toxic chemical spill in southwest China has disrupted water
supplies to 20 000 people since last week, a state newspaper said on
Monday [20 Feb 2006], the latest in a series of pollution incidents
to hit the country.
A power plant on the upper reaches of the Yuexi River in Sichuan province was
to blame for the pollution, which prompted environmental officials to suspend
water supplies to Guanyin Town since last Wednesday [15 Feb 2006], the
official China Daily said. [Map showing Sichuan:

Water was being trucked in to residents, but it was insufficient to
meet demand, it added.
Tests showed that the river had been polluted with chemicals,
including fluoride and nitrogen, the newspaper said.
Earlier this month [February 2006], 3 tanks at a chemical company in
the northwestern province of Shaanxi collapsed, discharging about
2000 tons of alkaline waste into a river which flows into the Yellow
River, China's 2nd-longest.
In one of the worst incidents, water supplies to millions of people in
northeastern China were suspended after a blast at a chemical plant in
November 2005 caused cancer-causing benzene compounds to leak into a major
river. The chief of China's environment watchdog was forced to resign
following that spill, which became an international incident, as the river
flows into Russia.
The Chinese government has promised to improve environmental
safeguards and has spent billions of yuan on cleaning up the
country's rivers, though experts warn some of it is misspent and
ineffective.

[Fluoride toxicity is characterized by a variety of signs and
symptoms. Poisoning most commonly occurs following ingestion
(accidental or intentional) of fluoride-containing products. Symptom
onset usually occurs within minutes of exposure.
Fluoride is found in many common household products, including
toothpaste (e.g., sodium monofluorophosphate), dietary supplements
(e.g., sodium fluoride), glass-etching or chrome-cleaning agents
(e.g., ammonium bifluoride), and insecticides and rodenticides (e.g.,
sodium fluoride).
Historically, most cases of fluoride toxicity have followed
accidental ingestion of insecticides or rodenticides. Fluoride has
several mechanisms of toxicity. Ingested fluoride initially acts
locally on the intestinal mucosa. It can form hydrofluoric acid in
the stomach, which leads to GI irritation or corrosive effects.
Following ingestion, the GI tract is the earliest and most commonly
affected organ system. Once absorbed, fluoride binds calcium ions and
may lead to hypocalcemia. Fluoride has direct cytotoxic effects and
interferes with a number of enzyme systems; it disrupts oxidative
phosphorylation, glycolysis, coagulation, and neurotransmission (by
binding calcium). Fluoride inhibits Na+/K+ -ATPase, which may lead to
hyperkalemia by extracellular release of potassium. Fluoride inhibits
acetylcholinesterase, which may be partly responsible for
hypersalivation, vomiting, and diarrhea (cholinergic signs). Seizures
may result from both hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia.
Severe fluoride toxicity will result in multiorgan failure. Central vasomotor
depression as well as direct cardiotoxicity also may occur. Death usually
results from respiratory paralysis, dysrhythmia, or cardiac failure.
