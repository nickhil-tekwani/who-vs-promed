Update: Neurologic Illness Associated with Eating Florida Pufferfish, 2002
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As of May 15, 2002, a total of 13 presumptive cases of saxitoxin poisoning
were reported in Florida residents who ate pufferfish caught in waters near
Titusville, Florida. Five cases were reported in April (1), and eight cases
were identified through increased surveillance by Florida poison control
centers, hospital emergency departments (EDs), and county health
departments. This report updates the investigation of these cases.
All 13 cases occurred during January 1--April 25, 2002. Nine were
identified through Florida poison control centers; four were identified by
active surveillance of hospital EDs and health department foodborne illness
complaint logs.
Investigators defined a case as tingling or numbness in the mouth and/or
lips in a person who had eaten Florida pufferfish. All ill persons reported
at least one of the following symptoms after a meal that included
pufferfish: tingling or numbness in the mouth or lips (13 persons), face
(eight), arms (10), legs (seven), and fingertips (one). In initial reports,
two patients reported ataxia, and one reported muscle weakness. Some ill
persons experienced nausea (six) and vomiting (four) before presenting to a
hospital ED. Symptom onset occurred 30 minutes to approximately 8 hours
after ingestion of fish (median: 2 hours). Duration of illness ranged from
10 hours to 45 days (mean: 6.6 days; median 24 hours). Eleven persons were
treated in an ED, and five were admitted to the hospital. Some patients
received intravenous fluids. All cases resolved.
Severity of illness was not associated with amount of pufferfish eaten, and
nine meal partners who also ate the pufferfish did not become ill. Testing
of approximately 25 pufferfish collected from Florida waters by the Food
and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition (CFSAN), in collaboration with the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FWC), and additional testing by FDA's Northeast
Regional Laboratory indicated that pufferfish containing potentially toxic
concentrations of saxitoxins (2--53 µg saxitoxin equivalent toxicity/g) are
present in the Indian River in the area of the Titusville Pier. Lower
concentrations of saxitoxin have been found in pufferfish from the South
Banana River.
All pufferfish related to these cases were caught in the Indian River
Lagoon; 11 patients caught pufferfish off the Titusville Pier. The FWC
banned retaining pufferfish caught from Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, and
St. Lucie counties on April 25; the ban will remain in effect until
mid-July. Information about this ban was provided at the Titusville Pier on
April 30, 2002.
No filets associated with the Florida illnesses were available for testing
to confirm the presence of saxitoxin. However, ongoing statewide sampling
of pufferfish in Florida has indicated that pufferfish containing
saxitoxins are limited to the Indian and South Banana rivers. Because
saxitoxin poisoning is usually associated with mollusks, CFSAN and the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services sampled
approximately 100 hard-shell clams from aquaculture lease sites at five
locations along the Indian River Lagoon, including the Titusville area in
Florida. Clams from two additional locations were chosen as control samples
and were collected from the west coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
All samples tested negative for saxitoxin.
Editorial Note:
The initial report described 10 illnesses that were associated with
pufferfish ingestion in three states (New Jersey, Virginia, and Florida)
and were consistent with exposure to saxitoxins (1). One case (New Jersey)
was associated with commercially purchased pufferfish from Titusville, and
all other cases resulted from recreationally caught pufferfish in the
Titusville area. Laboratory analysis by the Canadian Institute for Marine
Biosciences of partially eaten pufferfish from the New Jersey incidents
confirmed the presence of saxitoxin and two analogs (2). These results were
confirmed with additional analysis by FDA's Northeast Regional Laboratory (3).
Some previous intoxications by pufferfish in Florida were attributed to
tetrodotoxin (4). Seven cases of pufferfish poisoning were reported in
Florida during 1951--1974, including three fatalities (5,6). These case
reports were associated with ingestion of locally caught species of
pufferfish Sphoeroides. A 1963 study of pufferfish from the east coast of
Florida (from the Indian and Banana Rivers, including the Titusville area)
demonstrated that pufferfish were toxic to mice (4). Although the species
tested in this study was listed as Sphoeroides maculatus (northern
pufferfish), there was confusion over the identification of this species
with S. nephelus (southern pufferfish) (Figure 1). Northern pufferfish
extend only as far south as Jacksonville, Florida (7), and are not known to
exist in the Indian and Banana rivers.
The illnesses described in this report occurred after ingestion of
pufferfish but are consistent with the presence of saxitoxin, a paralytic
shellfish toxin usually associated with ingestion of filter-feeding
shellfish. Concentration of saxitoxin in the pufferfish tested from the
Titusville area varies. Saxitoxin has been reported in pufferfish from the
Far East (8) and the Philippines (9). Shellfish containing 2--10 µg
saxitoxin/g previously have caused illness (10), but saxitoxin has not
previously been reported in Florida. The severity of illnesses in persons
described in this report varied probably because of the concentration of
saxitoxin in a particular pufferfish and/or the amount of pufferfish eaten.
Approximately 100 species of pufferfish are known worldwide, and nine
species are present in Florida. Southern pufferfish populations have been
increasing in the Northern Indian River during the previous 5 years (FWC,
unpublished data, 2002). The southern pufferfish that have been caught
recently near Titusville are normally present in this area of Florida, but
they have not been implicated previously in fish poisoning events.
Sportfishers in Florida need to be educated that potentially toxic
pufferfish might be in the Titusville area. Warnings about the presence of
certain species of potentially toxic pufferfish should be posted in
commonly fished areas. Because many sportfishers vacation in Florida and
transport fish home to other states, health-care providers should be aware
that rapid onset of neurologic symptoms after a meal of pufferfish could be
caused by saxitoxin. Ingestion of paralytic shellfish toxins produces
neurologic symptoms that are sensory, cerebellar, and motor. The most
common symptoms are tingling and burning of the mouth and tongue, numbness,
drowsiness, and incoherent speech. These symptoms usually occur 30 minutes
to 2 hours after ingestion of the fish, depending on the amount of toxin
ingested. In severe cases, ataxia, muscle weakness, respiratory paralysis,
and death can occur (10). Ill persons should contact their local poison
control center and proceed to a hospital ED. Hospital EDs and poison
control centers should contact the local health department if persons
report neurologic symptoms after eating pufferfish.
