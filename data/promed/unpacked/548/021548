A total of 5 McLean County residents have confirmed cases of mumps, leading the county health department on [Tue 6 Jun 2017] to encourage people experiencing symptoms to isolate from others until they can be tested for the virus.

None of the 5 residents -- ages 22 -- 52 -- needed to be hospitalized and all are recovering, said Lisa Slater of the McLean County Health Department. The agency is working with the infected individuals and notifying their close contacts about possible exposure to the virus.

"We need to protect our most vulnerable populations -- those who cannot get the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine because of age or illness -- from exposure to mumps virus," Melissa Graven, health department communicable disease supervisor, said in a statement for several days.

People experiencing symptoms should stay home and call their health care provider. Everyone else should make sure they are up to date with their MMR vaccinations and, if they aren't, to make vaccination a priority, the health department said.

A total of 3 more Jacobs High School students have tested positive for mumps, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the district to 6, school officials announced [Wed 7 Jun 2017].

All 6 students previously had been vaccinated, according to a news release from Community Unit District 300.

The 3 students who most recently tested positive for mumps went to class through the last day of school, which was 25 May [2017], the release said.

Students and staff members who are not vaccinated or have compromised immune systems have been kept out of the school since 15 May [2017], when the 1st student tested positive for mumps.

None of the 3 students who recently tested positive shared classes, athletics or activities within the school setting, school officials said.

The school district, along with the health departments in Kane and McHenry counties, is monitoring the cases.

Mumps symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite and swollen glands, according to the Kane County Health Department.

If you feel like you might have a bad cold, don't shrug it off. Swollen jaw or not, it could be mumps.

The Capital Region [New York] is experiencing its 1st outbreak of mumps in years, with 45 cases in the 4-county region so far in 2017. For some parts of the area, these are the 1st cases of mumps in several years. And in Rensselaer County this year's 2 reported cases are the 1st seen there in 20 years, said Public Health Director Mary Fran Wachunas.

Albany County has seen the lion's share of mumps this year [2017], with 29 cases.
Most of them are traceable to 2 locations where the virus that causes the disease has spread. One is the University at Albany, where 22 patients had an association. The other is a local sports team, which had 6 cases.

Mumps cases by county, 2017

Albany : 29
Saratoga: 13
Rensselaer: 2
Schenectady: 1

In Saratoga County, where there have been 13 diagnosed cases of mumps, however, the patients are not connected by community, facility or demographic. That caused county officials to advise residents with suspected mumps symptoms to see a doctor immediately.

The most well-known symptom of mumps are swollen glands under the ears or jaw. But some patients who have the illness do not have that telltale sign, said Dr Rebecca Kobos, medical director for student health at UAlbany. Headache, muscle aches, loss of appetite and fever may be enough to indicate mumps, Kobos said, especially if a patient has been exposed to someone with the virus.

Her advice: See a doctor and take it seriously. Rest and stay away from work or school, so you don't expose other people to the illness. Rare but serious complications of mumps include swelling of the reproductive organs or the brain, as well as deafness.
Common sense is also handy.

"Precautions as simple as regular handwashing and covering one's mouth when coughing can go a long way to halt the spread of the virus," said Catherine Duncan, director of public health in Saratoga County.

The state's Department of Public Health's (DPH) spokeswoman Ann Scales confirmed that some of 12 new cases of mumps that are part of an ongoing outbreak in the area originated in East Boston.

Since the end of March [2017], 12 cases have been reported in Eastie, Boston, Chelsea and Revere among the neighborhood's Latino population.

Scales said the DPH will be reaching out to the Latino communities here and in the other communities affected by the outbreak in order to increase awareness about mumps and to encourage vaccination.

The DPH usually sees mumps outbreaks among college-age individuals attending local colleges and universities. However, what makes this outbreak unique is it is among adults ranging in age from 20 to 41 with no known connection to higher education. All of the residents hit by the outbreak are Latino and include members of the Colombian, Dominican, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran communities. None of those affected is known to have traveled internationally prior to becoming ill. For the majority of the residents, vaccination histories are unknown but most are believed to be unvaccinated against mumps. Unvaccinated individuals are most susceptible to mumps infection.

Health officials reported that this outbreak 'may represent a change in the epidemiology of mumps in Massachusetts'.

"MMR vaccination is highly protective against mumps and is recommended for children and adults," said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, MD, MPH, referring to the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. "In addition, those who have mumps should stay isolated at home for 5 days after their onset of swelling. Mumps is usually a mild disease but can cause serious illness. If you think you have mumps, stay home and call your healthcare provider.''

According to the DPH mumps virus is spread through infected respiratory tract secretions. It can be spread within 3 -- 6 feet when an infected person coughs or sneezes or with direct contact with infected secretions like sharing water bottles. The incubation period can range from 12 -- 25 days. Parotitis, or swelling of the salivary glands, is the most common symptom but non-specific symptoms such as myalgia, anorexia, malaise, headache, and low-grade fever may precede the parotitis by several days. In the pre-vaccine era, 15--30 percent of infections were asymptomatic.

People are considered infectious from 2 days before symptoms begin until 5 days after the onset of parotid swelling. Therefore, those suspected of mumps should be isolated and should refrain from public activities for 5 days after the onset of swelling.

DPH and local health departments are investigating these cases and instituting isolation and quarantine measures to control the spread of mumps.

East Boston Neighborhood Health Center could not confirm if any of the confirmed cases were treated at the clinic.

[According to the CDC [edited], from 1 Jan -- 20 May 2017, 42 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 3176 people to CDC.

Mumps is no longer very common in the United States. From year to year, mumps cases can range from roughly a couple hundred to a couple thousand. For example in 2016, there were approximately 5833 cases reported to CDC, and in 2012, there were 229. Before the U.S. mumps vaccination program started in 1967, about 186 000 cases were reported each year, but the actual number of cases was likely much higher due to underreporting. Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99 percent decrease in mumps cases in the United States.
