Detection of Races 1 and 2 of _Fusarium solani_ f. sp. _cucurbitae_ and
their Distribution in Watermelon Fields in Tunisia

A crown, foot and fruit rot of watermelon has been observed in most of the
watermelon production areas in Tunisia. A survey conducted from 2000 to
2001 allowed the isolation of 291 isolates which were identified as
_Fusarium solani_. These isolates were identified as _F. solani_ f.
sp._cucurbitae_ (Fsc) and races 1 and 2 characterized on the basis of
pathogenicity tests on watermelon seedlings and muskmelon fruits. These
results were confirmed by counts of the number of septa in the
macroconidia. About 271 isolates were identified as Fsc race 1, 12 isolates
were identified as Fsc race 2 and 8 isolates were not pathogenic.
Race 1 is widely distributed in watermelon production areas in Tunisia and
race 2 has a lower incidence, but it is present in the north, the middle
and southern Tunisian watermelon cropping areas. Additionally, a study to
compare the virulence of 122 isolates of Fsc race 1 showed different
degrees of virulence among them.
This is the 1st report of Fsc races 1 and 2 in Tunisia.

[Fsc causes necrotic lesions affecting the stem near the ground, eventually
resulting in girdling of the stem. Plants become wilted and die rapidly
during mid-season. The decay at the base of the stem is soft and mushy.
Fruit lesions begin as small corky cracks that develop into sunken necrotic
lesions. Internal tissue near the site of infection becomes off-color and
corky. Fruit decay results in a firm, dry rot. A PCR-based technique has
been devised to determine genome variability between Fsc isolates of Fsc
isolates races 1 and 2. Fusarium crown and foot rot occurs sporadically in
most areas, and disease severity is dependent on soil moisture and inoculum
density.
Because the fungus survives in the soil for only 2-3 years, a 4-year
rotation is usually adequate for disease control. Planting
fungicide-treated seed is also effective in reducing the incidence of
disease initiated from infected seed. Additional measures would include use
of resistant or tolerant cultivars if available and cleaning of farm
machinery and tools so as to prevent soil-borne spread of the pathogen. A
PCR-based technique has been devised to determine genome variability
between Fsc isolates of races 1 and 2.
