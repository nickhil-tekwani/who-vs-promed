Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) notifies a suspicion of _Marteilia sp._ on blue mussels in an aquaculture farm. For the 1st time this disease is suspected in Norway, a 1st occurrence in the country. During the routine surveillance, 30 blue mussels and 30 flat oysters were collected from the oyster pool (lagoon) on the Norwegian west coast. The oysters appeared healthy, but 12 of the mussels did not. The histopathological examination will be followed up with PCR as fast as possible. There is need for verification by European Union Reference Laboratory.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: traceability; modified stamping out; control of wildlife reservoirs

[_Marteilia refringens_ is a protozoan parasite of the phylum Cercozoa and order Paramyxida infecting the digestive system of several bivalve species and inducing physiological disorders and eventually death of the animal. Infection with _Marteilia refringens_ covers infection with _M. refringens_ including types M and O. http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_marteilia_refringens.htm

Marteiliosis due to _Marteilia refringens_ occurs in Europe where it infects flat oysters, _Ostrea edulis_ and mussels, _Mytilus edulis_ and _M. galloprovincialis_. Type M is more often detected in mussels and type O in flat oysters, however co-infection exists. This last event seems to be restricted to areas where the prevalence of the disease is high. http://www.eurl-mollusc.eu/Scientific-activities/Marteilia-refringens

The causal agent of _Marteilia refringens_ is not a risk to human health. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/aquatic-animals/diseases/reportable/marteilia-refringens/fact-sheet/eng/1362602145346/1362602305193. - Mod.CRD
