Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: El Sahugo, Salamanca, [Castile and Leon]
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Nov 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 23 Nov 2017
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 213 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: a positive case of atypical BSE type H. Cohort research is on-going.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0.47 / 0 / 0 / 0.47
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments:
On [10 Nov 2017], the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete (National Reference Laboratory for TSEs [transmissible spongiform encephalopathies], accredited under UNE-EN ISO/IEC 17025: 2005 standard), received a nervous tissue sample suspected of BSE from the accredited Regional Laboratory for Animal Health in Villaquilambre, Le√≥n (official regional laboratory), after a positive result was obtained through a Bio-Rad TeSeE SAP rapid test. The NRL carried out the confirmation tests authorized according to Regulation (EU) no. 1148/2014. The selected combined tests were Western blot (Prionics) and ELISA (Idexx HerdChek BSE-Scrapie Antigen Test Kit) and positive results were obtained for both tests. Afterwards, tests for BSE strain discrimination were made through differential digestion and immunoblotting, confirming atypical BSE strain type H on [21 Nov 2017]. The sample was taken within the national TSE surveillance program (sampling of dead or non-slaughtered animals for human consumption over 48 months old). The animal was a crossbred cow born on [14 Jun 1999].

Control measures
Measures applied: traceability, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, selective killing and disposal, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: official destruction of animal products

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory, Algete (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Western blot / 21 Nov 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal neurological disease of adult cattle that was first recognised in Great Britain (GB) and that has been identified in classical (C-type BSE) and atypical forms. Both C-type BSE and atypical forms have been detected in cattle indigenous to most European countries, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease.

Atypical forms of BSE are believed to occur spontaneously in all cattle populations at a very low rate, and has only been identified in older cattle. They have been detected in many countries, but only as an incidental finding when conducting intensive surveillance for C-type BSE. The discrimination of atypical phenotypes from the classical BSE type is based on Western immunoblot banding pattern and bioassay characterization."
