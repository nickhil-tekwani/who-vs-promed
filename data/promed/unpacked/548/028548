Epidemiological comments: the Official Veterinary Service was informed of a West Nile fever positive result in a 20-year-old horse bred in an urban area, near a forest; the animal showed neurological clinical signs after having fallen in July [2019], followed by ataxia and claudication and, in the following weeks, convulsion and decubitus. The animal was euthanized before the diagnosis was confirmed. There are no other animals with clinical signs on the premises.

["West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic mosquito-transmitted arbovirus belonging to the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae.

"WNV has a wide geographical range that includes parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus), and in North, Central, and South America. Migratory birds are thought to be primarily responsible for virus dispersal, including reintroduction of WNV from endemic areas into regions that experience sporadic outbreaks. WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle, whereas humans and horses are considered dead end hosts.

"The occurrence of disease in humans and animals along with bird and mosquito surveillance for WNV activity demonstrate that the virus range has dramatically expanded including North, Central and South America as well as Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin.

"WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the northern hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses."
