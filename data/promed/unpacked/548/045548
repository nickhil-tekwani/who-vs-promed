re: Antibiotic resistance & agricultural uses - USA (02):(Europe)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
I disagree with Dr Hurd's post. To suggest that an occupational exposure
that results in 20-40 per cent of individuals becoming colonized with MRSA
does not constitute a major public health issue seems to me incorrect.
Anyone who has dealt with the issue of community-acquired MRSA in
correctional facilities in recent years will know that significant
occupational health and safety concerns have emerged in occupational groups
at lower risk of occupational acquisition of MRSA colonization than that
described here for swine workers.

The cross-sectional risk of infection described in these reports is a bit
of a red herring: colonized individuals would be predicted to develop skin,
soft-tissue, pulmonary, and other infections over time, and that would not
likely be captured in cross-sectional surveys. These individuals will also
transmit occupationally acquired colonization to non-occupational contacts.
Given the rapidity with which community MRSA emerged as a major public
health issue after initial identification, I see no reason to doubt that
this would occur, as this strain is clearly very fit when it comes to
colonizing humans.

Finally, with respect to the accuracy of reported morbidity: it wasn't
clear to me whether these were workplace carriage studies. If that's the
case, the reported risk of infection would be low-balled due to healthy
worker effect, as anyone with a more severe staph infection is not going to
be at work when the swabs are being taken.

I don't know how many individuals in the Netherlands and Belgium are
involved in the pork production industry; in Canada, which is a major pork
exporter, my understanding is that something like 70 000 jobs are related
to direct production of pork
(<http://manitobapork.com/letter_from_a_hog_producer_to_canadians.aspx>).
If one assumes that each of these jobs is held by a unique individual, you
could be talking about 0.2 per cent of the entire Canadian population
directly involved in pork production. If Canadian MRSA epidemiology were to
converge with that described in these reports, this would constitute a an
extremely important public health challenge.

Apologies for my tardy reply. I was traveling, in Canada actually. Also, I
wanted to carefully consider your comments to see whether I might also
disagree with myself. Its seems we may just disagree about orders of
magnitude. This is understandable as RISK is best expressed as a continuous
variable which is a function of Probability and Consequence.

When I said "public health", my referent population was generally all folks
in the US or Canada (approx. 330 mil). Relative to everyone, the percentage
of pig workers is very low. Therefore the probability of EXPOSURE to ST398
in the average person is very low (say 0.2 percent in Canada). Of those
exposed through pig work say 20-40 per cent become colonized. We have 14
000 to 28 000 colonized pig workers in Canada, wrongly ASSUMING all farms
have ST 398.

Second, the consequence of infection with ST398 seem to be much lower than
community acquired MRSA.

"Despite the high prevalence of nasal MRSA, active MRSA skin infection was
detected infrequently (less than 1 per cent),.." (Oliver et al. Jul 2009)

The US Centers for Disease Control was asked to address the relative risk
of food animal MRSA and community-acquired. [In their report: The Centers
for Disease Control & Prevention's (CDC) Responses to Questions on
Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Food-Producing
Animals Addressed in the 14 Dec 2007 Letter From the House Committee on
Agriculture] a couple of their responses were:

"It is reasonable to conclude that the vast majority of these common skin
and soft tissue infections result from person-to-person transmission of
MRSA in the community";

"CDC and others have investigated number outbreaks of community-associated
MRSA infections in the United States, and in none of these investigations
has animal exposure been identified as a risk factor for infection".

So, I am not saying animal MRSA is not a problem, in fact I will be much
more careful around livestock and dogs. However, it does not seem to be
"major" in comparison to the human community acquired MRSA. It may be an
important occupational risk for many of my friends who are swine workers.
They will have to add it list of other risks they take daily.
