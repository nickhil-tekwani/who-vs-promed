A 15 year old girl infected with hantavirus in Rancagua [capital of
Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins Region (Libertador) or Region VI] is
still seriously ill, hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit of the Regional
Rancagua Hospital. She was diagnosed with Hantavirus infection last Friday
[10 Nov 2006].
Mr Maximiliano Solis, sanitary action chief from O' Higgins Regional
Ministerial Health Secretariat [SEREMI, according to its Spanish acronym],
visited Coltauco, the community where the patient lives. While there, he
ruled out their girl's home (in Rinconada del Parral) as the source of the
infection, or "Berta Zamorano" School, where she is currently attending
junior high.
However, Mr Solis pointed out that there might be some other cases, since
the girl went out on a trip to Los Ulloa hills, a potential place for
contagion. "Eventually more cases may occur; thus, it is important to have
strict follow up of all possible contacts", said Mr Solis. The health
officer added that "this is the reason we have to request information from
the school asking who else went on this trip, in order to have proper
follow-up, speak to the relatives and start educational and preventive
measures".
According to the Chief of the ICU in Rancagua Hospital, the patient began
experiencing hantavirus infection symptoms on 3 Nov 2006, and this may be
the first case of this infection during this season in the 6th Region.

[From Carlota Medus: The Chilean Government Ministry of Health, Department
of Epidemiology (MINSAL), in its Hantavirus Epidemiological Bulletin Update
of 22 Nov 2006
(<http://epi.minsal.cl/epi/html/bolets/reportes/Hantavirus/Hantavirus.pdf>)
reports the situation this year as 33 confirmed cases of hantavirus
cardiopulmonary syndrome, and a case/fatality rate of 44 per cent (14
patients died). According to the places where infections were acquired,
cases were distributed from the 5th to the 11th Regions.
The number of confirmed cases for November 2006 is within the expected range
for this time of the season. Total number of observed cases in year 2006 is
lower than expected (55 cases); however, because of the elevated mortality
rate this year, it is of paramount importance to reinforce strict
surveillance by health care teams, in order to have early diagnosis of
suspected cases, so they are hospitalized in time and get adequate medical
management.
Although the report does not indicate it, the hantavirus in this case is
probably Andes virus. Maps of Chile can be accessed at:
