The source of a salmonella outbreak at the Broughton Hall nursing
home will probably never be known, after final scientific tests on
suspect food and water samples were found to be clean. "More than 40
food and water samples were tested, as well as equipment used for
preparing food in the kitchen," Victoria's acting Chief Health
Officer, Dr John Carnie, said yesterday, 27 Apr 2007.
A sample taken from a batch of eggs did test positive for salmonella,
Dr Carnie said, but it was not the same type that caused the
gastroenteritis outbreak. "Also, these eggs were not from the same
batch consumed prior to the outbreak," he said.
Fecal samples taken from 11 residents have tested positive for the
salmonella. These did not include samples taken from the 5 residents
whose deaths have been linked to the outbreak.
Residents were allowed to again drink water from the mains supply,
after police concluded investigation into a contamination allegation.
They had had only bottled water for the past week.
A Health Department spokesman said it was still most likely that the
salmonella outbreak had originated in food prepared in the home's
kitchen. "Just because we haven't found anything, the epidemiology
still points to something that was present in the kitchen at a point
in time," he said. The contaminated food is likely to have been eaten
or thrown out, he added.
