[With the continuing decline in the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- the scope of
the occasional ProMED-mail updates has been broadened to include other
prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data on other forms of
CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 8 Aug 2011
has risen to 172. A total of 3 definite/probable patients remain
alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases is 175.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and now 2 so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
------------------------------------------------------------
During 2011 so far [as of 8 Aug 2011], there have been 100 referrals,
44 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS, 6 cases of familial
CJD, 2 case of vCJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2833 referrals, 1259
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 172 cases of vCJD, 88 cases of familial
CJD, 65 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 44 cases of GSS.

[The nationality of the latest vCJD fatality is is not known, but a 23
year old (possibly Bosnian) male patient was reported to have died as
a result of vCJD in the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London in
mid-July

Cumulative data 1 Jan to 28 Feb 2011, the 12 months of 2010, and
overall since 1996 [unchanged since previous update]
-----------------------------------------------------------
During the 1st 2 months of 2011, there have been 52 referrals, 28 of
whom were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 10 cases of
sporadic CJD, 3 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

During the 12 months of 2010, there were 403 referrals, of whom 251
were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 208 cases of
sporadic CJD, 40 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic or vCJD.

Overall, 3952 referrals have been examined since screening began in
1996 or thereabouts, with diagnoses pending in 13 cases or
inconclusive in 18 cases, a measure of the difficulty in achieving
unequivocal diagnoses.

During this 16 year period, a total of 2329 prion disease cases have
been screened, a figure which includes 18 (15 during 2010) cases with
type determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. Overall, there were 1965 cases of sporadic CJD, 338 cases of
familial CJD, 5 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 3 cases of vCJD. The 3
cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to infection
occurring in the United Kingdom in 2 cases, and in Saudi Arabia in the
other.

[4] GSS prion

University of Tennessee scientist uncovers trigger to fatal
neurodegenerative disease
-----------------------------------------------------------
Jeremy Smith, governor's chair for molecular biophysics at the
University of Tennessee, Knoxville, has helped reveal a key trigger of
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome, a rare but deadly
neurodegenerative disease. The finding could have far-reaching
implications for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases
such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's.

Smith conducted his research with 2 collaborators in Italy: Isabella
Daidone, a former postdoctoral researcher of his who is now at the
University of L'Aquila, and Alfredo Di Nola of the University of Rome
"La Sapienza".

Most GSS patients begin developing symptoms in their late 50s.
Symptoms include loss of memory, difficulty speaking, and unsteadiness
and lead to progressive dementia and then death within a few months or
years. There is presently no cure or treatment. The disease results
from a single, tiny mutation in a protein, resulting in it having a
wrong shape-through "misfolding" -- then aggregating to form amyloid
plaques in the brain.

"Ever since the 'mad cow' scare in Britain in the 1990s, which led to
several hundred human deaths and 4.4 million cattle being destroyed,
I've been interested in finding out more about these fascinating
diseases of wrongly-shaped proteins," said Smith, who was born in
England.

The team compared high-performance computer simulations of the
structures of the normal and the GSS-mutant proteins. They found the
GSS protein looks dramatically different from the normal form and
revealed how its shape is primed for plaque formation.

"This research shows how computer simulation can be used to pinpoint
changes in molecular structure that lead directly to disease," said
Smith. "We think that a similar line of investigation should prove
beneficial in understanding the origins of other amyloid diseases such
as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and rheumatoid arthritis. Once the origin
is understood at molecular detail, strategies to rationally prevent
and cure a disease can be conceived."

Di Nola, Jeremy C Smith. Molecular origin of
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome: insight from computer
simulation of an amyloidogenic prion peptide. Biophysical Journal
2011; 100(12): 3000-7, 22 June
http://www.cell.com/biophysj/abstract/S0006-3495%2811%2900574-1. The
abstract reads:

"Prion proteins become pathogenic through misfolding. Here, we
characterize the folding of a peptide consisting of residues 109Â­122
of the Syrian hamster prion protein (the H1 peptide) and of a more
amyloidogenic A117V point mutant that leads in humans to an
inheritable form of the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome.

"Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations are performed for 2.5 mus.
Both peptides lose their alpha-helical starting conformations and
assume a beta-hairpin that is structurally similar in both systems. In
each simulation several unfolding/refolding events occur, leading to
convergence of the thermodynamics of the conformational states to
within 1 kJ/mol. The similar stability of the beta-hairpin relative to
the unfolded state is observed in the 2 peptides. However, substantial
differences are found between the 2 unfolded states. A local minimum
is found within the free energy unfolded basin of the A117V mutant
populated by misfolded collapsed conformations of comparable stability
to the beta-hairpin state, consistent with increased amyloidogenicity.
This population, in which V117 stabilizes a hydrophobic core, is
absent in the wild-type peptide. These results are supported by
simulations of oligomers showing a slightly higher stability of the
associated structures and a lower barrier to association for the
mutated peptide. Hence, a single point mutation carrying only 2
additional methyl groups is here shown to be responsible for rather
dramatic differences of structuring within the unfolded (misfolded)
state."

Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is an extremely rare,
neurodegenerative brain disorder. It is almost always inherited and is
found in only a few families around the world. Onset of the disease
usually occurs between the ages of 35 and 55. In the early stages,
patients may experience varying levels of ataxia (lack of muscle
coordination), including clumsiness, unsteadiness, and difficulty
walking. As the disease progresses, the ataxia becomes more pronounced
and most patients develop dementia. Other symptoms may include
dysarthria (slurring of speech), nystagmus (involuntary movements of
the eyes), spasticity (rigid muscle tone), and visual disturbances,
sometimes leading to blindness. Deafness also can occur. In some
families, parkinsonian features are present. GSS is a slowly
progressive condition usually lasting from 2 to 10 years. The disease
ultimately causes severe disability and finally death, often after the
patient goes into a coma or has a secondary infection such as
aspiration pneumonia due to an impaired ability to swallow. For

[5] CWD prion shedding

Detection of CWD prions in salivary, urinary, and intestinal tissues
of deer: potential mechanisms of prion shedding and transmission.

Abstract: Efficient horizontal transmission is a signature trait of
chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids. Infectious prions shed into
excreta appear to play a key role in this facile transmission, as has
been demonstrated by bioassay in cervid and transgenic species and
serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA).

However, the source(s) of infectious prions in these body fluids have
yet to be identified. In the present study, we analyzed tissues
proximate to saliva, urine, and feces production by sPMCA in an
attempt to elucidate this unique aspect of CWD pathogenesis.
Oropharyngeal, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tissues, along with
blood and obex [the point in the brain at which the 4th ventricle
narrows to become the central canal of the spinal cord] from
CWD-exposed cervids (comprising 27 animals and >350 individual
samples) were analyzed and scored based on apparent relative CWD
burden.

PrPCWD-generating activity was detected in a range of tissues, and was
highest in salivary gland, urinary bladder, and the distal intestinal
tract. In the same assays, blood from the same animals and unseeded
normal brain homogenate controls (n = 116 of 117) remained negative.
PrP-converting activity in peripheral tissues varied from 10-11 to 100
- fold that found in brain of the same animal. Deer with highest
levels of PrPCWD amplification in the brain had higher and more widely
disseminated prion amplification in excretory tissues. Interestingly,
PrPCWD was not demonstrable by conventional western blotting in these
excretory tissues, suggesting low prion burden or the presence of
protease-sensitive infectious prions destroyed by harsh proteolytic
treatments. These findings offer unique insights into the transmission
of CWD in particular, and prion infection and trafficking overall.
