Cow Deaths Investigated
--------------------------------
The deaths of several cows in southern Connecticut have state officials wondering if a new type of
encephalitis or the so-called St Louis strain [SLE is to blame. The newly discovered strain is
called West Nile encephalitis. Health officials say it's NOT as dangerous as the St Louis type, but
can still cause major problems. Test results are due back today on the dead cows.
In the meantime, officials have halted all mosquito spraying in Fairfield County, where several
birds have died from [WN virus.

[As far as I know, WNV has not been isolated from cattle, but antibodies have been found in cattle
in Nigeria, Pakistan, Romania & Italy. It has been isolated from horses in Egypt, France & South
Africa, so veterinarians in the north-eastern USA should be on the lookout for horse deaths (see [2
below). Kunjin virus has been isolated from cattle in Australia, but so far it seems that an
Australasian virus (Kunjin) is less likely to be the culprit than an Afro-European one (WNV). If
memory serves, SLE antibody was detected in dairy herds in New York State by Elinor Whitney in
1965 - Mod.JW

If WNV normally kills horses, or at least makes them very ill, why no reports of encephalitic
horses in New York City & Connecticut? They have enough of them thereabouts and not vaccinated
I suspect, even against EEE. And owned by folk who can afford good veterinary care. Dead crows
all over the place for weeks and not one sick horse? Very odd!
Maybe it is time for a warning and heads-up reminder to our veterinary colleagues on the East &
West Coasts? Maybe some bleeding could be done on horses working in NYC, eg police stables
and tourist carriages? Telephone survey of the horse pratices in the area for memory recall of
suspect cases?
The same when screening for equine rabies. While I am sure the clinical signs are very different,
that may be only so to those with clinical experience. And how many vets these days see rabies in
horses much less West Nile encephalitis?
