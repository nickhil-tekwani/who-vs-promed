From: Alexander Vladyko <briem@nsl.hmti.ac.by>
As I understand it, about 4300 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) were reported in Bashkiria (Autonomous Republic in Russia)
within [the first 9 months of this year. It is estimated [that this is
more than a six times increase in [hantavirus morbidity versus the same
period of 1996 and is twofold higher than during the last peak of
incidence, in 1994.
Approximately 2700 HFRS patients were [detected in Ufa (capital of
Bashkiria), 6 of them having lethal outcomes.

More detailed information ( the role of certain mouse species in
transmission, application of RT-PCR diagnosis etc.) may be obtained from
Dr. Eugine A. Tkachenko, Moscow.

[Thanks to Dr. Vladyko to respond so quickly to our request for further
information. Now, if anyone reading this is in contact with Evgenyi
Tkachenko, please ask him to e-mail me <calisher@usa.healthnet.org> or to
provide to ProMED-mail any PCR data he might have that is relevant to this
epidemic. Clearly, this is an unprecedented experience, as far as we know.
