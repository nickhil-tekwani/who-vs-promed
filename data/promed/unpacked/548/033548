According to the territorial office of the Russian (Health) Protection
Agency (Rospotrebnadzor), 2897 suspected cases of hepatitis A virus
infection have been recorded in Nizhniy Novgorod since the outbreak began
on 5 Sep 2005. A precise diagnosis has been confirmed in 2395 people,
including 366 children. At present 404 patients remain in hospital. A firm
diagnosis of hepatitis A virus infection was not confirmed in another 502
people seeking medical assistance.
On Wed 16 Nov 2005, another 46 people, including 7 children, were
hospitalized on suspicion of hepatitis A virus infection. 50 people were
discharged for outpatient supervision.
In total, 73 652 people have been vaccinated and another 9606 people have
received immunoglobulin. As stated above, the outbreak of hepatitis A in
Nizhniy Novgorod began on 5 Sep 2005, and epidemiologists now predict that
morbidity will increase up to the end of 2005, since the predominant mode
of transmission of infection is now person-to-person contact.

[This represents an increase of 680 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus
infection since the previous report on 24 Oct 2005. This equates to about
32 cases per day, so the 46 cases admitted to hospital on Wed 16 Nov 2005
suggests that the outbreak is not yet under control. - Mod.CP]
