Indonesia: No sequence data have been obtained from birds for nearly a year
-----------------------------------------------
Bird flu outbreaks in Indonesia are going unstudied. Nature has
learned that very few, if any, avian influenza virus samples from
Indonesian birds have been sent to official labs for sequencing over
the past year. This data blackout comes just as surveys of the
country are revealing a startling number of previously unrecognized
avian outbreaks.
"We have had no sequence data from poultry viruses for Indonesia for
almost a year, since last August 2005," says Peter Roeder, a
consultant for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in
Indonesia. "It just happened; no one was sending any samples," he says.
Experts say that without thorough genetic sequencing of bird viruses
from the area, it is difficult to tell whether the virus is mutating
or how the human cases correspond to birds in the area. There have
been some human viruses found in Java that so far have no obvious
avian counterparts, perhaps simply because matching strains in birds
have not been sequenced, or perhaps not.
Only now has a batch of such samples finally arrived at the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reference library in Geelong,
Australia. "Good news: more than 100 animal isolates ready to go,"
reads a report from an international expert consultation on combating
H5N1 in Indonesia, held in Jakarta in late June [2006]. Some 91 of
these samples have now arrived, says Roeder.
This activity may have been spurred by the limited human-to-human
spread of H5N1 seen within a family in Kubu Sembelang in May this
year [2006]. Scientists are keen to compare the human viruses with
previous avian outbreaks in the area, but no such recent samples have
been available.
Reporting of poultry results from Indonesia is "inadequate," with
"specimens going into a 'black box,'" read the Jakarta meeting
documents, adding that "this lack of information on avian H5N1
viruses requires urgent attention. Over the next few months, there
will be quite intensive genetic analysis of the samples," says
Roeder. "This is something we really have to get on top of."
It has been difficult to organize sampling in Indonesia, Roeder says,
with a decentralized system of responsibility for collecting viral
material in a country spread over some 6000 inhabited islands with
many backyard farms. But that seems to be improving. There is an
Indonesian government strategic plan, being assisted by the FAO, to
create a large, coordinated surveillance and control program around
the country. A pilot scheme involving 12 teams has been running in
the area around Jakarta since January this year [2006].
The results of that pilot scheme have proven startling. The Jakarta
teams alone have discovered an average of 24 previously unknown
infected locations a week between January and May 2006. "The
community surveillance system is starting to work," says Roeder.

[Avian influenza H5N1 virus was 1st reported in poultry in Indonesia
on 2 Feb 2004, and the 1st human case on 21 Jul 2005. Since that time
the number of confirmed human cases has risen to 54 with 42
fatalities (as of 26 Jul 2006).
Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes of isolates of H5N1 viruses
dating from 2004 and 2005 established the existence of 2 distinct
lineages or clades. The viruses in each of these clades were
distributed in non-overlapping geographic regions of Asia. The
viruses from the Indonesian archipelago were tightly clustered within
clade 1 (see: Evolution of H5N1 Avian Influenza viruses in Asia. The
WHO Global influenza Program Surveillance Network. In: Emerging
Infectious Diseases, Vol. 11, no. 10, October 2005). Viruses isolated
from surrounding countries were distinct from the clade 1 viruses and
formed a more divergent clade 2. While the H5N1 outbreaks in poultry
in most Asian countries have been contained or diminished, the
outbreaks in Indonesia continue unabated. Phylogenetic analysis of a
greater range of Indonesian isolates will reveal trends in the
evolution of the virus, the influence of control of infection by
vaccination, and the relationship of the "North Sumatran Cluster" of
isolates from close relatives to the virus genotypes in circulation
in the general human and avian populations. - Mod.CP]
[Indonesia has, so far, refrained from carrying out mass culls of
poultry in all infected areas, saying it cannot afford to compensate
farmers. Reportedly, biosecurity is poorly applied, and awareness of
the disease, specifically in the countryside, is deficient. Culling
has been undertaken on a (very) limited scale. Vaccination is
allowed, but seems to lack coordination, while not covering the huge
backyard fowl population. Fighting cocks play their role as well, as
apparent from Indonesia's last follow-up notification to the OIE,
dated 21 Apr 2006; see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_21.htm#Sec2>.
