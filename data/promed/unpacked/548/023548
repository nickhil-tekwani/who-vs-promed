South Carolina: First Case of Human West Nile virus Infection Reported
----------------------------------------------------------
State health regulators say an upstate outdoorsman is [likely] South
Carolina's [& North America's] first human case of West Nile virus this year.
The state Department of Health & Environmental Control (DHEC) says an Oconee
County man bitten by mosquitoes while fishing was recently hospitalized with
the disease. DHEC Commissioner C. Earl Hunter said the man is improving and
was released from the hospital. In 2002, a woman in Union County was
confirmed with the disease.
The agency says West Nile virus shows itself with flu-like symptoms such as
headaches, swollen glands, muscle aches and a rash. "In most cases, the virus
results in very mild disease and many people who may be exposed never become
sick," Hunter said. The disease is spread when a mosquito bites an infected
bird, then bites a human. The disease cannot be spread from person-to-person,
Hunter said. Hunter says only one in 150 people bitten by an infected
mosquito will become severely ill.
People should protect themselves against the disease by wearing long sleeves
and long pants, and by using an insect repellent when outdoors. Residents
should check their properties and areas for standing water where mosquitoes
might breed.
DHEC asks anyone who finds dead crows, blue jays, cardinals and raptors like
owls, hawks or eagles to call an agency office to see if the bird should be
tested [for WNV].
