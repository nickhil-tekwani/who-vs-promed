Second banana farm tests positive to tropical disease
-----------------------------------------------------
A 2nd Far North Queensland banana farm near Mareeba, inland of Cairns, has tested positive for Panama disease tropical race 4 [TR4], as the destruction of trees at the 1st farm, further south near Tully [ProMED-mail post 20150305.3208525], comes to an end. The highly infectious disease could have a devastating impact on Queensland's AUD 600 million [about USD 462 million] industry if not contained.

Biosecurity Queensland [BQ] has moved quickly to quarantine the Mareeba property [and] said it would remain under quarantine while further samples [are] taken to confirm the extent of the disease. "The entire farm will be surveyed and any infected plants will be destroyed," Jim Thompson, BQ, said.

"We will also be undertaking investigations to identify how this property may have become infected, including if there are any links [with] the 1st infected property. While this development is understandably disappointing, we have been preparing for [it]," Dr Thompson said. "Our focus remains on controlling and containing the disease while we determine the extent of the outbreak."

Australian Banana Growers' Council's Jim Pekin said it was working closely with BQ. "This 2nd detection in a separate North Queensland banana growing area further emphasises the need to remain vigilant [and] the need for strong on-farm biosecurity measures."

Destruction of 60 000 diseased banana plants on the Tully Farm is reaching its concluding stages. BQ will continue to monitor the area in the months ahead.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But tropical race 4 (TR4), which is at present devastating Cavendish production throughout Southeast Asia, has recently also been reported for the 1st time outside that area in Jordan (ProMED-mail post 20131107.2044265) and Mozambique (ProMED-mail post 20131206.2095450). It is of great concern worldwide.

In Australia, race 1 and temperate race 4 are present in parts of the country (ProMED-mail posts 20081212.3908 & 20071024.3451), and TR4 was reported for the 1st time in 1997 in the Northern Territory. When a new TR4 outbreak occurred there in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120817.1248624), it was concluded that quarantine restrictions had no effect, and they were lifted. This has increased the risk posed by TR4 to the main banana growing areas on the east coast considerably, and development of TR4 resistant cultivars has now become a top priority for the national banana industry.

While the Tully outbreak has been declared "contained" (see updates below), a source for that outbreak still needs to be identified. As mentioned above, it will be important to investigate a source for the new outbreak and any possible connections with the 1st case in order to design effective management strategies. Unfortunately, once a pathogen has been introduced into a new area, eradication attempts have very rarely been successful in the past.
