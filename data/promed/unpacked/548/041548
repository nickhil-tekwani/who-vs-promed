Egypt: 21st human case of avian influenza virus reported
--------------------------------------------------------
A 37-year-old Egyptian woman has tested positive for the deadly bird
flu virus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Egypt to 21, a
World Health Organisation official said on Wed 14 Feb 2007.
"There is a case, 37-years old, from Fayoum. She has been transferred
to Abbasiya (hospital) in good condition," said Hassan el-Bushra,
regional adviser for communicable diseases surveillance for the World
Health Organisation. Fayoum, a province southwest of Cairo, is the
same area where a 17-year-old girl died of bird flu this month. Egypt
has the highest known cluster of human cases outside Asia, with 12
deaths out of the 21 infected cases since the virus first surfaced in
Egyptian poultry a year ago [2006]. The woman, who kept birds in her
home, was admitted to hospital on Mon 12 Feb 2007 after coming into
contact with infected poultry, officials said.
Most people infected in Egypt had been in contact with poultry kept
at home. Bird flu initially caused panic across the country and did
extensive damage to the poultry industry. The Egyptian government
said last month [January 2007] poultry production had recovered to
1.8 million birds a day, just short of the 2 million produced before
the outbreak.
Officials said the woman was responding well to treatment, and there
was no indication she was infected with a mutated strain of the H5N1
virus that had shown "moderate" resistance to the anti-viral drug
Tamiflu. "We are not suspecting mutation anymore," said Cairo-based
WHO official John Jabbour. "This case is stable. [The patient] is
responding to treatment."
The mutated strain of the virus [which showed moderate Tamiflu
resistance] killed 3 Egyptians in the Nile Delta province of Gharbiya
in December [2006], according to the Egyptian Health Ministry. [This
mutant virus has not reappeared].
Officials have said the 17-year-old infected earlier this month
[February 2007] in Fayoum died because she did not get treatment
early enough, not because of the [drug resistance] mutation. She was
initially treated for seasonal flu after her family denied she had
come in contact with infected birds.
The WHO reaffirmed last May [2006] that patients should get Tamiflu
as a frontline treatment for bird flu, and said in certain cases
doctors may consider using it along with amantadine, an older class
of effective anti-flu drugs.
Health experts fear the H5N1 virus could mutate into a form that
passes easily from human to human, sparking a pandemic that could
kill millions. The virus has killed 166 people worldwide since 2003,
mostly in Asia.

[This additional human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection
is the 21st recorded in Egypt. The death toll in Egypt remains at 12.
All but one of the Egyptian cases have been women, probably
reflecting a higher risk of infection associated with domestic
poultry rearing and food preparation.
The overall global total of confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian
influenza now becomes 274, including 163 fatalities.
