What's the situation with regard to dengue in Guatemala? I have a patient

[The sender of this message seems to be writing from Spain. I do not know
the situation with regard to dengue in Guatemala. If anyone reading this
has such information, please let us know. Finally, I point out that many
febrile illnesses are mimicked by and mimic dengue. Laboratory
confirmation is necessary. I trust Dr. Miguelez is collecting serum
samples at appropriate intervals and will submit them to an adequate
reference diagnostic laboratory. - Mod.CHC]
