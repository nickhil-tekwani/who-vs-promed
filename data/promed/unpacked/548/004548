[In 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was detected in 2 Dalmatian pelicans, these cases were reported in the Akzhayik Nature Reserve which is located in the delta of the Ural River. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=17771.

In March 2006, Kazakhstan also reported an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in wild swans in the region of Mangyshlak. The summary report and map of this previous outbreak is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=4603.

Since the neuraminidase has not yet been determined, characterizing the subtype and strain of this virus is very important and requested. - Mod.CRD
