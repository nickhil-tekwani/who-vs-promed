[African swine fever (ASF) is a serious viral disease of pigs, endemic in Africa. The virus is currently the sole member of the new genus Asfivirus in the family _Asfarviridae_. ASFV is the only DNA virus transmitted by arthropods.

Cape Verde has only submitted 6-monthly and annual reports for the years 2008 and 2009 (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/reporting/reporthistory).

According the 2009 annual report, ASF was reported as "present" in the country, but no quantitative information was provided, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2009&semester=0&wild=0&country=CPV&this_country_code=CPV&detailed=1

Since December 2009, Cape Verde has not submitted any reports to the OIE, until this current immediate notification report. Therefore, the ASF situation in other parts of the country is unknown.

A 2012 EMPRES-FAO report indicates that for "Western Africa: ASF occurs sporadically in most countries of the region. Cape Verde experienced a further spread of the disease in early 2011. Togo reported outbreaks in the south of the country, a region that had not been affected before, with stamping out measures apparently limiting potential epidemic spread. Unlike in southern and eastern Africa, the role of wild suids in maintaining virus circulation is not clear." (http://www.fao.org/3/a-ap372e.pdf).

For an OIE map showing the African countries which have reported ASF outbreaks during the last 10 years, see http://tinyurl.com/khomboo.

Cape Verde, officially the Republic of Cabo Verde, is an island country spanning an archipelago of 10 volcanic islands in the central Atlantic Ocean. Located 570 km (350 mi) off the coast of Western Africa, the islands cover a combined area of slightly over 4000 sq km (1500 sq mi) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde)
