People in the Russian republic of Buryatia have been urged not to buy meat
at street markets after an anthrax outbreak killed a man.
The farmer, 62, died on July 7, and another 10 people are known to be
infected by the bacteria. More than 600 others have been placed under
medical observation, and 200 of them are receiving antibiotics.
The outbreak is thought to have been caused by anthrax-infected beef.

[This is an update on the previous report. The large number of people under
antibiotic treatment and observation would indicate that the affected
animal or animals had been butchered and the meat sold in a local market;
see warning. Unfortunately a not unusual Russian scenario for this disease.
