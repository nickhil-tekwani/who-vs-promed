Health investigators have concluded that barrels of ice placed in the lobby
of Kerr Hall facilitated the E. coli outbreak that sickened 58 people
after a drill team camp in June on the University of North Texas campus.
Texas Department of Health representatives said, however, that the
investigation did not reveal the original source of the potentially fatal
microorganism.
A student or students who attended the June 9-11 camp apparently
inadvertently tainted the ice, which was in large barrels inside the
entrance to the dormitory, state health officials said. The ice was made
available to the campers to cool soft drinks.
"It appears campers infected with the bacteria used their hands to scoop
out the ice and contaminated it," said David Bergmire-Sweat, the lead TDH
epidemiologist for the investigation.
Mr. Bergmire-Sweat said the bacteria could have been brought on campus by
one or more of the campers when they arrived for the camp, or one or more
of the campers may have eaten something off campus, become infected and
then tainted the ice.
Health Department spokesman Doug McBride said Tuesday that the organism can
survive freezing temperatures.
"Cooking, of course, kills the bacteria, but it can survive in freezing
cold."
Mr. McBride said it isn't known if the ice could have an effect on the
longevity or mobility of the organism.
"Our epidemiologist says there hasn't been that much research done on the
behavior of this bacteria," Mr. McBride said. "We know ice doesn't kill
it, but we don't know if it prolongs its life, shortens it or has any
effect on its mobility."
UNT spokeswoman Kelley Reese said the ice was provided by the university,
but the camp sponsor was responsible for supervising its use. University
officials noticed the ice was being handled improperly during a
self-inspection following the outbreak, she said. At that time, she said,
the buckets were removed and campers were asked to get ice from vending
machines in the dormitory cafeteria.
"We're relieved that TDH was able to identify the way the bacteria was
spread among the campers," Ms. Reese said. "But we're disappointed that
they weren't able to find out how the bacteria got on campus to begin
with."
Investigators earlier this month identified the bacteria as _Escherichia
coli_ O111:H8 and said the Denton episode was the first known outbreak of
that strain in the United States. The bacteria, which stems from the
intestinal tracts of cattle, has caused outbreaks of illness in Australia
and Europe.
At least two campers were hospitalized with kidney problems. Catherine
Harvey, 16, of Colleyville continues to fight the infection at Baylor
Medical Center in Dallas.
"It is a never-ending saga," said her mother, Carla Harvey.
Doctors initially were successful in helping Ms. Harvey's kidneys recover
from a shutdown, but the illness left by the bacteria has traveled to her
brain.
"The prognosis is very good, but it's one day at a time," Mrs. Harvey said.
"It's going to take quite a while for her to recover from this."
Most of the people affected came from the Grapevine-Colleyville school
district, but officials said additional reports of illness also were
received from other locations. Students from Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri
attended the camp.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the health departments
of Denton and Tarrant counties also participated in the investigation.
