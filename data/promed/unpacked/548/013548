The measles virus strain called D4-Hamburg, which 1st reached
continental Europe in 2008, has caused more than 25 300 cases in 12
European countries over the past 27 months, with the vast majority of
them in Bulgaria, according to a report published online yesterday [19
Jul 2011] in Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID).

The virus spread from London to Hamburg in December 2008 and later
moved to Bulgaria, which has had 24 379 cases so far. The virus is
largely but not exclusively associated with travel by members of the
Roma ethnic group, says the report by a large international research
team. Cases have been identified in Poland, Ireland, Northern Ireland,
Austria, Greece, Romania, Turkey, Macedonia, Serbia, Switzerland, and
Belgium, and the virus was repeatedly re-imported to Germany. The
authors say their findings "underline the need for the development of
strategies to address this ethnic minority [the Roma] at the regional
level and to improve their integration into the respective national
health services." But they add that measles elimination "should not be
seen exclusively as a Roma-associated problem," as public health
authorities face a broader challenge of "closing vaccination gaps in a
setting of optional vaccination and vaccine skepticism." Last week,
the ECDC reported that Europe has had more than 21 000 measles cases
so far this year [2011], most of them related to a large epidemic in
France.

Abstract: "A new strain of measles virus, D4-Hamburg, was imported
from London to Hamburg in December 2008 and subsequently spread to
Bulgaria, where an outbreak of over 24 300 cases was observed. We
analyzed spread of the virus to demonstrate the importance of
addressing hard-to-reach communities within the World Health
Organization European Region regarding access to medical care and
vaccination campaigns. The D4-Hamburg strain appeared during 2009-2011
in Poland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Austria, Greece, Romania,
Turkey, Macedonia, Serbia, Switzerland, and Belgium and was repeatedly
re-imported to Germany. The strain was present in Europe for over 27
months and led to over 25 000 cases in 12 countries. Spread of the
virus was prevalently but not exclusively associated with travel by
persons in the Roma ethnic group; because this travel extends beyond
the borders of any European country, measures to prevent the spread of
measles should be implemented by the region as a whole."

The authors comment that: "Because sequencing results are not
available quickly in most countries, this transmission chain is
probably still ongoing. Epidemiologic data showed that the spread of
D4-Hamburg across Europe involved predominantly persons from the Roma
ethnic group in Bulgaria."

"Another transmission chain affecting the Roma population in
particular was recorded in 2004 in Romania. An outbreak of over 8000
cases associated with MVs/Bucharest.ROU/48.04[D4] commenced in the
Roma population. Subsequent spread of D4-Bucharest by traveling Roma
persons was observed until 2007. The pronounced sequence deviation of
D4-Bucharest and D4-Hamburg indicates the presence of at least 2
distinct and successive transmission chains in the Roma population.
Both chains were long lasting and associated with a high number of
cases, as well as several fatalities. This and other recent outbreaks
in Roma communities underline the need for the development of
strategies to address this ethnic minority at the regional level and
to improve their integration into the respective national health
services."

Measles in Italy, July 2009 to September 2010
---------------------------------
Summary: Outbreaks of measles continue to occur in Italy, as in other
European countries. We present here details of cases reported through
the Italian enhanced measles surveillance system from July 2009 to
September 2010.

In total, 2151 cases were reported, 42 percent (n=895) of which were
laboratory confirmed. The median age of cases was 18 years, and 1709
of 1856 cases (92 percent) were unvaccinated. Many cases with
complications were reported (n=305), including 3 with encephalitis. A
total of 652 of 1822 cases (36 percent) were hospitalised.

Molecular characterisation revealed circulation of a limited number
of measles virus genotypes (D4, D8 and B3), which is consistent with
the current epidemiology of the disease in Italy. A national measles
elimination plan was approved in 2003 with the aim of interrupting
endemic measles transmission by 2007. Since elimination was not
achieved, the target date was recently moved to 2015. The emphasis of
the new elimination plan, approved in March 2011, is on strengthening
surveillance, implementing evidence-based interventions to increase
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine uptake in children, adolescents and
young adults, and implementing communication activities related to the
vaccine. The strategies proposed by the plan should be implemented
fully and appropriately by all regions in order to meet the
elimination goal by 2015.

The following comments have been extracted from the Authors'
Discussion relating to severity of infection in relation to age, and
the results of phylogenetic analyses which complement the Hamburg data
in part [1].

"Many cases with severe complications were reported, especially in
the older age groups, and over 650 cases were hospitalised. The
percentage of complications seen is in accordance with that reported
in the literature and clearly reflects the severity of measles.
Encephalitis was observed in 3 cases; 7 cases had thrombocytopenia,
and many cases had pneumonia (in some, it led to respiratory
insufficiency). It is also noteworthy that the 4 measles cases who
were pregnant had a spontaneous abortion or premature delivery. Health
professionals and the general public should be made aware of the
occurrence of these serious complications. In addition, it must not be
forgotten that cases of measles, in particular those requiring
hospitalisation, impose a substantial economic burden on the
healthcare system and society and that MMR vaccination has been shown
to be extremely cost saving."

"Phylogenetic analyses revealed circulation of measles virus
genotypes D4, D8 and B3 in Italy during the period covered in our
analysis. The D4 genotype sequences were all closely related to each
other and were indistinguishable from those that had circulated in
Italy in 2008 and in 2009 and 2010 in the WHO European Region. D4 had
been the predominant viral genotype circulating in the country in 2008
and probably represents an endemic strain of the virus in Italy. BLAST
analysis showed that the D8 genotype sequences were all closely
related to each other and to strains that had circulated in 2009 in
Europe and India. This genotype was 1st isolated in Italy in February
2008, while B3 was identified in 2006 to 2007, in an outbreak in
Apulia and in the Lazio, South Tyrol and Sardinia regions. The B3
genotype recently isolated was indistinguishable from viruses isolated
in Africa in 2009. The data presented here show that a limited number
of genotypes are presently circulating in Italy, as occurs in
countries with endemic transmission of measles virus, as opposed to
countries reaching elimination, in which co-circulation of multiple
imported genotypes generally occurs."

It should be emphasized that there is no evidence that the measles
genotypes currently distinguishable by phylogenetic analyses differ in
their control by vaccination. - Mod.CP]

A child died, and several others were taken ill after they were
administered measles vaccine here, officials said today [22 Jul 2011].
The 9-month-old child died, and several others were taken ill
yesterday when they were administered the vaccine during a drive in
Avadhupr Hazipur village in Ghungter area here. The condition of 2
children is serious.

The child's father has lodged a complaint against the medical
officer, ANM [auxiliary nurse] and a health worker in this regard. In
a preliminary inquiry, health officials have admitted that the vaccine
vials were left open for long hours.

The 1st measles case since 2007 has been reported in Mexico, and the
patient is an 18-month-old French girl, Health Secretary Jose Angel
Cordova said. The girl arrived in Mexico City on a flight from Paris
in the past few days, and health officials are trying to locate the
other passengers who were aboard the plane, Cordova said.

"The patient is an unvaccinated French girl, one-year-and-6-months
old, (who) arrived in our country. A positive diagnosis has already
been made, and ... a health cordon is being established," the health
secretary said.

The last case of a Mexican infected with measles was reported in
2004, and a foreigner was diagnosed with the disease in Mexico in
2007, according to a Health Secretariat spokesman.

"The most complicated thing" is finding those who had contact on the
plane "because (the girl) certainly may have been infected there,"
Cordova said, adding that he learned about the case only on Wednesday
[20 Jul 2011]. Health officials were prepared to handle a situation
like this and "we are seeing that there has been an important rise (in
the number of cases), particularly in Europe, (while) in the United
States, the majority (of measles cases) are not autochthonous, but it
is the same because of the movements (of people) that you have," the
health secretary said.

A health cordon is in place at the Mexico City airport, and people
traveling to the United States and Europe will be vaccinated, Cordova
said. Health officials are monitoring 7 other airports in Mexico, the
health secretary said.

Health authorities in the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas
established a sanitation barrier around border neighborhoods in the
city of Nuevo Laredo after detecting 2 possible cases of measles,
officials said.

The head of Health District No. 5, Jaime Emiliano Gutierrez, said
that the 2 cases were detected in children ages one and 5, which
prompted the state's Health Secretariat to carry out the corresponding
studies to confirm or disprove the existence of the disease. "These
are suspicious cases," he said.

While results were being obtained, sanitation barriers were
established on Friday [22 Jul 2011] around 40 blocks in each of the 2
neighborhoods where the children live. Gutierrez said that vaccination
has been stepped up for people who never had the disease, along with
other preventive measures. "It's an illness you can only have once in
a lifetime, so if you had it as a child, you no longer run the risk of
contagion," he said.

Federal authorities had already detected one case [see part (4)
above), that of a little French girl who arrived in the Mexican
capital several days ago from Paris, the 1st case of the disease
detected in the country since early 2007. Because of it, the Mexican
government announced it will purchase 3.6 million doses of measles
vaccine to prevent the disease from spreading. "We must act very
quickly because of the speed with which it spreads," Health Secretary
Jose Angel Cordova told a press conference. Vaccination stations will
be set up at hospitals and clinics as well as at Mexico City's
international airport. The vaccine will be offered to all Europe-bound
flyers over the next 20 days, while airport employees are required to
get shots. Mexico's last indigenous case of measles was 14 years ago.

Authorities recommend measles vaccinations for children under 11 who
were never vaccinated and for people between the ages of 12 and 39 who
received an initial vaccination but no subsequent booster shot. The
government expects to vaccinate around 2 million people, and the extra
doses will be used for ongoing vaccination campaigns, Cordova said.

He emphasized that around 95 percent of Mexican children receive
vaccinations. Around 1500 Mexico City airport workers have already
received shots, and authorities are trying to track down the other
passengers who arrived on the same flight as the French girl.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) has
been notified of the potential for measles exposure in Southern Maine.
Maine CDC was contacted by the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social
Services on Thursday [21 Jul 2011] and informed that a Quebec resident
who recently traveled to the Old Orchard Beach and Saco areas has been
diagnosed with measles. Quebec has been experiencing an increase in
measles cases recently, and the ill Quebec resident had not been
vaccinated against the disease.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus.
Symptoms usually begin one to 2 weeks after exposure and include high
fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a rash. An individual
infected with measles can transmit the virus to others who are not
immune from 4 days before their symptoms start until 4 days after the
rash resolves. The virus is spread through the air by breathing,
coughing or sneezing. The Quebec native diagnosed with measles was
vacationing in Southern Maine from 15 to 18 Jul 2011.

"If you or your children are at risk for measles and become ill with
the symptoms of this disease, you should tell your health care
provider so that precautions can be taken to avoid exposing anyone
else," said Dr. Stephen Sears, State Epidemiologist. "If you or your
family members are not up to date with vaccine or you have questions
about whether you are immune, you should contact your healthcare
provider."

Most people in the United States and in Maine have been vaccinated
and are immune to measles. The MMR vaccine is routinely given to
toddlers when they are 12 to 15 months of age and a 2nd dose is
required for all Maine school children. Persons who are at risk for
the disease include infants less than one year old and persons born
after 1957 who have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Health care
providers who treat patients with suspected cases of measles should
call the Maine CDC at 1-800-821-5821 for consultation and to arrange
testing.

Health officials say a reported case of measles in northern Utah has
turned out to be a false positive. The Bear River Health Department
announced on 11 Jul 2011 that it had 6 cases of measles in Cache
County [See part [7] of Measles update 2011 (23) 20110717.2169.]. The
agency now says that 6th case wasn't measles after all.

The Utah Department of Health says 9 cases of measles were confirmed
in Salt Lake County earlier this year [2011] and one in central Utah.
Bear River Health Department spokeswoman Jill Parker says the 1st case
in Cache County involved a child exposed in mid-May 2011. Officials
say those born after 1957 who haven't received 2 vaccine doses should
get immunized. These are the 1st Utah cases since 2005.

Auckland's measles outbreak is up to 72 cases reported, and officials
say the disease is likely to spread. [Previously, the total was given
as 64 in part [10] of Measles update 2011 (23) 20110717.2169. -
Mod.CP]. Five people have been hospitalised so far from the disease,
which has mostly occurred in West Auckland, with some having spread to
Central Auckland, North Shore and Manukau.

Medical Officer of Health Dr Richard Hoskins urged parents to take
care during the school holidays to stop measles spreading. "If your
child is unwell or you suspect they have been exposed to measles and
are not up to date with MMR immunisations, we would ask that you
refrain from sending them to any scheduled group activities including
community gatherings."

Of the over 400 people contacted by the Auckland Regional Public
Health Service over the outbreak, not counting schools, "over 200 have
been assessed as immune to measles and do not need to be in
quarantine," he says. Five people are currently in quarantine.

The outbreak was 1st connected to an unimmunised child who attended
Oratia District School in West Auckland. Another was attributed to a
Thai Airways flight, TG491, which landed in Auckland on 19 Jun 2011
with a passenger suffering from the early stages of the infection.
