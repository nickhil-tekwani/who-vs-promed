HPAIV H5N8 in harbour seals in Germany
--------------------------------------
During August 2021 slightly increased mortality has been observed among harbour seals (_Phoca vitulina_) as part of an intensive monitoring program in the German Wadden Sea [Lower Saxony]. Several dead harbour seals were collected in the 2nd half of August 2021 by the Institute for Terrestrial and Aquatic Wildlife Research (ITAW) of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany (TiHo). In samples of 2 animals, highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus (HPAIV) was detected by RT-qPCR at the Institute of Virology (TiHo) on 3 Sep 2021 and immediately reported to the local authorities. Subsequent examinations led to the detection of HPAIV of the subtype H5N8 in both animals with the highest viral genome loads in the brain. Morbillivirus-specific RNA, in contrast, was not detected. Post mortem and virological investigations of a third carcass, processed at the Veterinary Investigation Centre of the German Federal State of Schleswig-Holstein and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI), likewise revealed high viral loads of HPAIV, subtype H5N8, in the brain of the animal. No or very low viral loads of H5N8 were present in other tissues including the lung. Further intensified surveillance has been initiated and special precautionary advice applies to staff recovering and handling clinically affected and dead seals. Further work characterizing the seal viruses is ongoing at TiHo and FLI.

[Several subtypes of AI viruses (H7N7, H4N5, H4N6, H3N3, and H10N7) have caused epidemics in harbour seals, but they do not appear to become established in this carnivore species. HPAI H5N8 closely related to the virus circulating in poultry farms at the time was detected in 2 gray seals (__Halichoerus grypus_) stranded on the Baltic coast of Poland in 2016 and 2017. In November 2020, a harbor seal (_Phoca vitulina_) and a gray seal were found infected by HPAI H5N8 virus in the context of a seal mortality event in the UK. In seals and other wild mammals, HPAI H5N8 causes encephalitis and death. - Mod.PMB
