As Field Marshal Sir William Slim stated during WW II in
Burma..."Doctors don't prevent malaria...Commanders do!" He goes on
to say that once he sacked ("fired") a couple of his commanders with
high rates of malaria; the remaining commanders got the point and
instituted rigorous command-directed and -observed malaria
prophylaxis. The Post article does a disservice to the troops. The
health of the command is the commander's responsibility. "Sack" the
commander and the next time we deploy troops to endemic areas I
suspect the rates will be significantly lower!.

I do not entirely agree with the moderator's comment that it is
comforting that non-compliance rather than direct failure of the drug
is responsible for the cases of malaria among US soldiers in Liberia.
No prophylactic regime can be effective without adherence. Adherence
is more than compliance -- it depends on education, motivation, and
active cooperation of the client. Non-adherence is a serious issue,
and probably reflects information and communication deficits that
need to be addressed.

[ProMED thank Dr Dale Carroll and Dr Johannes Schaeffer for sending
their comments. We certainly agree with Dr Schaeffer's comment that
communication deficits need to be addressed. This is more directly
expressed in Dr Carroll's comment, which places the responsibility
for non-compliance on the army. - Mod.EP]
