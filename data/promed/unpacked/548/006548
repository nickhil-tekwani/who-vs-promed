Alberta canola fields attacked by disease, bugs
-------------------------------------------------
An unidentified crop disease and an insect not seen before in Alberta are
eating away at the province's canola fields, says plant pathologist Ralph
Lange.
The disease began showing up about two weeks ago when farmers near
Vermilion, Alta., began reporting greyish discoloration in their canola.
Other symptoms, including shrivelled seeds, have started to emerge all over
the eastern half of the province.
Researchers think the disease could be caused by one of two fungal pathogens
that have infested Saskatchewan and Manitoba but have never been seen at
significant levels in Alberta.

[Canola seeds, also known as rape-seed, are an important source of vegetable
oil. Many of you have probably admired the fields of small bright yellow
flowers - Mod.JW]
[Identification of the fungal pathogens is under way, but Ralph Lange
reports that a definitive identification will take several weeks. I will
post the definitive identification of the pathogen as soon as I get it -
