[1] Poland: seed potatoes

The NPPO of Poland recently informed EPPO of the confirmed report [see comment below] of _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (_Pospiviroid_, PSTVd - EPPO A2 List) on its territory.

In 2016, PSTVd was detected in 2 lots of seed potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_ cvs. 'Etola' and 'Denar') in 2 districts of Kujawsko-pomorskie province, and the infected areas were estimated at 2.8 ha and 5 ha, [respectively]. In both cases, the identity of the viroid was confirmed by molecular methods (RT-PCRs using different types of primers, sequencing).

Official phytosanitary measures have been implemented in the whole of the 2 places of production (22 ha in the 1st case and 10.56 ha in the 2nd one). All infected and possibly infected potatoes will be used for industrial purposes (distillery). On infected fields, planting of potatoes or any other host plants of PSTVd will be prohibited until the end of 2017; volunteer potato plants and other naturally occurring host plants of PSTVd will be eliminated.

In 2018, only the cultivation of ware or industrial potatoes will be allowed, and potato harvest will be subject to official sampling and testing. On the infected production sites, all equipment and stores will be disinfected, and surveys will continue.

[2] Netherlands: breeding line ex Northern Ireland

The NPPO of the Netherlands recently informed EPPO that PSTVd has been detected in potato breeding material. During official surveys, PSTVd was detected in one potato genotype. Symptoms (growth cracks) were observed on tubers of infected plants. In total, 4 plants of this genotype were grown in 2 small fields owned by a breeding company. The company had started performing small-scale field selections of breeding material but did not produce any seed- or ware potatoes.

The infected genotype had been imported from Northern Ireland in 2016. All other genotypes cultivated in the same fields tested negative for PSTVd, but a 2nd negative test will be required before this material can be used for further breeding purposes. It is also noted that no direct links exist between the infected genotype and commercially available potato cultivars.

The identity of the pathogen was confirmed in August 2016 by laboratory analysis (RT-PCR, sequencing). Phytosanitary measures have been taken and include the destruction of all infected potato material and a prohibition to grow potatoes in both fields for a period of 2 years.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato, and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 per cent in potato and up to 50 per cent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd and may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PSTVd has been included on the EPPO A2 quarantine list.

Symptoms in potato may include spindly shoots, stunting of plants, severely distorted tubers (spindles) and delayed sprouting. In tomatoes, symptoms include leaf chlorosis and distortion, shortening of internodes, stunting of plants and absence of flowers. Capsicum plants show stunting and a loss of plant vigour but often display only mild symptoms of leaf distortion. Infection of solanaceous ornamentals is often symptomless. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, but mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 per cent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Tomato seed has been shown to constitute a considerable quarantine risk (ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560). Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers; tomato and capsicum explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insects and during handling procedures) and plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. The presence of PSTVd (and other pospiviroids) in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries and must be considered a threat to crops. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can survive in dried sap or plant residue for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, phytosanitary procedures, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material. Pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide because of their potential effects on a number of very important crops and the high risk of incursions via commercial imports.

Item 1
------
In Poland, PSTVd was reported in established, asymptomatic plants of ornamental _Solanum jasminoides_ which were randomly collected from several provinces (ProMED-mail post 20131218.2122275 and see link below for E Hennig et al., 2013, Plant Disease 97, 1663). Detection was by PCR and the origin of the PSTVd positive _S. jasminoides_ was reported as uncertain. This contradicts a claim in the original source above of being a '1st confirmed report' of the pathogen in the country.

Item 2
------
In the Netherlands, an eradication programme of PSTVd in potato breeding material has been in progress. Although PSTVd is known to occur in the UK, the origin of the breeding line above, it appears that the material was not certified free of the viroid, or that diagnostic testing was not sufficient before release to the breeder. Similarly, a current PSTVd outbreak on seedless capsicum in southern areas (ProMED-mail post 20160422.4175522) was traced back to propagation material imported from Israel.
