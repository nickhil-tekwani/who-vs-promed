VENEZUELAN EQUINE ENCEPHALITIS, ALERT - USA (02)
================================================

It should be noted that the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus
currently circulating in southern Mexico appears to be most closely related
to enzootic subtype 1 variety E (or 1E) viruses. This observation is
interesting because VEE 1E viruses are not normally equine virulent. The VEE
virus responsible for the 1995 epizootic in Venezuela and Colombia was the
an epizootic subtype 1 variety C (or 1C) virus.
This information is important when considering equine vaccination policies.
There is no evidence that current VEE virus vaccines derived from epizootic
subtype 1 variety AB (or 1AB) VEE viruses will protect animals from
infection with enzootic 1E VEE viruses. In fact, anecdotal evidence (lab
infections) suggest that this cross-protection does not occur. This lack of
1AB/1E cross-protection is also supported by laboratory analysis of VEE
virus molecular antigenic structure. Vaccination with 1AB VEE virus derived
vaccine will protect from infection with the closely related epizootic 1C
VEE viruses.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
