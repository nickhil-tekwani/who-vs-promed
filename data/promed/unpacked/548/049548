First Report of Tomato infectious chlorosis virus in Tomato in Indonesia.
J. Th. J. Verhoeven, T. M. Willemen, and J. W. Roenhorst, Plant Protection
Service, Section Virology, P.O. Box 9102, 6700 HC Wageningen, the
Netherlands; and R. A. A. van der Vlugt, Plant Research International, P.O.
Box 16, 6700 AA Wageningen, the Netherlands. Plant Dis.87:872, 2003;
published on-line as D-2003-0506-02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 15 Apr
2003.
In 2002, a breeding company submitted several samples of tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) for diagnosis. Samples originated in Indonesia
and were taken from protected and nonprotected crops. Plants exhibited
severe chlorosis on fully expanded leaves, while young leaves were symptomless.
Symptoms resembled those of the criniviruses Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV)
and Tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV). Moreover, large numbers of
whiteflies, potential vectors of these viruses, had been observed at the
plots with symptomatic plants.
A reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with specific
primers for TICV (1) yielded amplicons of the expected size of
approximately 500 bp for all samples. One of the amplicons was sequenced
(Genbank Accession No. AY221097) and revealed more than 98.9 percent
identity to 6 isolates of TICV in NCBI Genbank.
cDNA synthesis using the universal crinivirus primer HSP_M2-DW
(5'-TCRAARGTWCCKCCNCCRAA-3') followed by PCR with a ToCV specific primer
set (ToCV-UP 5'-TCATTAAAACTCGGGACCGAG-3' and ToCV-DW
5'-GCGACGTAAATTGAAACCC-3') was negative in all cases.
Grafting of symptomatic shoots onto healthy tomato seedlings of cv.
Money-maker showed transmission of the virus, as chlorosis appeared on
fully expanded leaves of lateral shoots after 6 weeks.
The presence of TICV in the graft-inoculated plants was confirmed by
RT-PCR. Furthermore, mechanical inoculation to a range of herbaceous test
plants did not evoke any virus symptoms, indicating the absence of
mechanically transmissible viruses.
Although other nonmechanically transmissible viruses cannot be fully
excluded, the results together with the symptoms observed, indicate that
TICV is the cause of the disease.
TICV has been reported from Greece, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the United
States, but to our knowledge, this is the first report of TICV in Indonesia.

[ToCV is transmitted by the greenhouse whitefly, _Trialeurodes
vaporariorum_, and is a nasty pest, especially in glasshouse operations.
Although it can cause severe crop losses in fresh market and
glasshouse-produced tomatoes, damage is generally minor. It also infects
several other food crops monitored by ProMED-Plant such as lettuce
(_Lactuca sativa_) and potato (_Solanum tuberosum_). Disease management
requires use of virus-free transplants, avoidance of susceptible hosts,
especially weeds, roguing of infected plants, and control of insects by
insecticides. - Mod.DH]
