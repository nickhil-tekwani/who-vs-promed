The state and central governments have failed to provide any treatment to patients diagnosed with hepatitis C in Kokernag villages of [the south Kashmir district of Anantnag] even as the "silent killer" continues to consume precious lives. At least 10 patients have died in the past 2 months because of hepatitis C in these villages while few others are battling for life in various Kashmir hospitals, reports said.

The lives of hundreds of patients in Takia Magam, Sonabarie, and some adjacent villages [in Anantnag district] are at risk, with governments failing to provide them any medicine or monetary assistance.

The hepatitis C was detected in Takia Magam and Sonabarie villages and some adjacent areas in February last year [2013]. After the collection of samples, almost 60 per cent of the population from the twin villages was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Some isolated cases were detected in other villages of Kokernag as well.

The state government later sent a proposal to the Centre for providing costly medicine to the patients. The proposal, however, has not been approved even as health experts declared a large-scale epidemic in the area. They also warned of further spread of the infection in case precautionary measures were not taken.

A man, 48, of Magam village -- who was diagnosed with hepatitis C last year [2013] -- died in November after he was admitted to SK Institute of Medical Sciences [SKIMS, in Nohata, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir]. "The doctors at SKIMS told us that he was suffering from hepatitis C infection from many years," said his family members. They said due to their poor financial condition, they could not afford to treat him outside.

Another man, 55, of the same village reportedly died last month [December 2013] after he was battling for his life at a hospital. "He was complaining of severe abdominal pain for 8 months and after conducting investigations doctors found his liver completely damaged," said his family members.

Reports said many other people from the same village, who were infected with hepatitis C, lost their lives this month [January 2014]. These include a man, 65; and another man, 50. Among the dead was also a 35 year old married woman. Another middle-aged man from adjacent Drawai village, according to reports, was taken to PGI [Post Graduate Institute] Chandigarh following his deteriorating health condition at SKIMS and his liver was found to be completely damaged.

Many other patients from Takia Magam, Sonabarie, and some other villages, according to reports, are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in Kashmir and the condition of few of them is slated to be critical.

"A woman is undergoing treatment at SMHS hospital [in Srinagar] for the past one week," sources said. Her family members say doctors have termed her condition as "critical". Another woman, 45, is battling for her life in the hospital even as her husband and 3 children have also been diagnosed with hepatitis C.

"There is grave fear in Magam and Sonabarie villages as a result of outbreak of the disease and the consequent deaths," says a villager. He said hepatitis C patients are now directly referred to SKIMS or SMHS from district hospital Anantnag (Islamabad).

"Last year [2013] when media reported the infection, ministers and health department officials made beelines to the affected areas and promised free treatment. But now patients have been left at the mercy of God. Nobody is coming forward to help them," he rued.

Another resident said since many villagers are not financially sound, they are unable to get themselves treated or even examined. "Few families have sold their land for treatment of their patients," he said.

Noted gastroenterologist Dr MS Khuroo had declared the infection as epidemic. He had warned that if the authorities did not wake up, the situation could worsen in years to come.

Health experts had also declared the infection as decades old transmitted by some specific source. "The mode of transmission is same as HIV [unlike HIV, hepatitis C virus is rarely transmitted sexually. - Mod.TY] and as such, besides necessary treatment of the already infected, educating and creating awareness among the people is equally important to prevent the further spread of this silent disease," said a medico, wishing anonymity.

Director of Health Services Kashmir, Dr Saleem-U-Rehman, said, "Till now we have not received any assistance from the Union Health Ministry for the treatment of the hepatitis C patients." However, official sources said the proposal of the state government was rejected by the centre. "The central government does not have any specific program for the treatment of the disease which is prevalent in Punjab and Haryana too. Also, it will need crores [1 crore = 10 million] of rupees for treatment of the affected people. So the central government has been reluctant to approve the proposal," said an official.

Director of SKIMS Dr Showkat Zargar also said they have not received any assistance from the Union Health Ministry for treatment of the affected villagers.

However, about the reports of deaths, Dr Zargar said, "Deaths can occur in advanced stage [of disease] only. The infection is decades old, may be even 30 years. So the infection might have lead to some deaths." He, however, said attributing every death to the infection cannot be right as the infection is not fatal in initial stages, which may go even up to 20 years.

[Hepatitis C virus infections are not uncommon in India. High incidence of hepatitis C was reported in Kalala village, Barnala district, Punjab state, in July 2013.

Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of hepatitis C and its virus (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130724.1843447): "Hepatitis C is found worldwide, with some countries having chronic infection rates as high as 5 per cent and above. The main mode of transmission in these countries is attributed to unsafe injections using contaminated equipment. Hepatitis C is not a waterborne infection as believed by the Kalala villagers. Hepatitis C virus is most commonly transmitted through exposure to infectious blood. This can occur through receipt of contaminated blood transfusions, blood products, and organ transplants; injections given with contaminated syringes and needlestick injuries in health care settings; injection drug use; or by being born to a hepatitis C infected mother. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, or water, or by casual contact with an infected person.

About 75-85 per cent of newly infected persons develop chronic infection and 60-70 per cent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 per cent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 per cent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 per cent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C.

Combination antiviral therapy with interferon and ribavirin has been the mainstay of hepatitis C treatment. Unfortunately, interferon is not widely available globally, it is not always well tolerated, some virus genotypes respond better to interferon than others, and many people who take interferon do not finish their treatment. This means that while hepatitis C is generally considered to be a curable disease, for many people this is not a reality.

Scientific advances have led to the development of new antiviral drugs for hepatitis C, which may be more effective and better tolerated than existing therapies (involving combined use of interferon and ribavirin). However, these drugs are too expensive for widespread use. - Mod.CP"
