Nigeria reports bird flu outbreak
---------------------------------
Health authorities reported Wednesday [23 May
2007] an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus in Nigeria's northern state of Zamfara, the
official NAN news agency said.
The virus was confirmed through tests on affected
birds in Namaturu village and more than 200 birds
had been culled to curtail the spread of the
disease, said Aminu Abdulrazak from the state
health ministry. The whole area had been
disinfected and villagers had been advised to
follow advice from doctors on the matter, he added.
Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with some
140 million people, earlier this year [2007]
reported west Africa's 1st human bird flu death.
A 22-year-old woman died in Lagos on 17 Jan 2007,
weeks after plucking and disembowelling a chicken.
Bird flu was 1st detected in Nigeria on a farm in
Jaji town outside the northern city of Kano in
February last year [2006] from where it spread to
other parts of the country. Kano, northern
Nigeria's most populous city, was worst affected
by the flu outbreak which ravaged 97 farms in the
city resulting in the death or culling of at
least 300 000 birds, officials said. Katsina,
Sokoto and Bauchi, 3 other northern states, have
recorded a resurgence of bird flu since it resurfaced in Kano.

[News of an outbreak in the far northwest of
Nigeria is not good news for West Africa, coming
on the heels of yesterday's announcement of a
second avian influenza outbreak north of Kumasi
in Ghana. As always no matter where the disease
occurs, many of the key questions remain
unanswered; especially where the infection came
from and how can further spread be prevented.
Identification and testing of high risk flocks in
relation to this focus of infection is the
paramount challenge. A key now is whether there
will be further spread. In all probability this
is an isolated outbreak which will be quickly
cleaned up but intense and strategic surveillance
becomes a key disease control tactic in such situations.

formerly a part of Sokoto state, can be found at:

Poultry farm closed down near Calcutta
---------------------------
Authorities closed down a poultry farm in eastern
India after hundreds of chickens died. Samples
have been sent to a federal laboratory to
determine whether they were infected with bird
flu, a top official said Friday [25 May 2007].
Preliminary tests indicated the chickens may have
died from Newcastle disease, a highly contagious
respiratory virus, and not the deadly H5N1 strain
of bird flu, said Dilip Das, director of the
Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services.
Newcastle disease affects all species of birds,
but is not known to attack humans.
Samples have been sent to India's High Risk
Animal Disease Laboratory in the central Indian
city of Bhopal for a final determination, Das
said. The chicken farm is located on the
outskirts of Calcutta, capital of West Bengal
state. India confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 in the
west last year [2006], but declared itself bird
flu free after slaughtering hundreds of thousands
of chickens. No human cases were reported. The
H5N1 virus has killed at least 186 people,
largely in Asia, since late 2003, according to the World Health Organization.
Earlier this month [May 2007] the deaths of more
than 2500 chickens at a poultry farm in north
Bengal were attributed to Newcastle disease after
laboratory tests in Bhopal proved negative for
bird flu. Das said there were 60 million chicken
and ducks in West Bengal state.

[We would very much like to confirm this
diagnosis as there are always 2 immediate,
pressing alternative diagnoses for high mortality
events in chickens: avian influenza and Newcastle
disease. Previous reports have mentioned 'ranikhet' disease.
This outbreak is notable because it is happening
in a metropolitan area, near a major
international airport and right in the middle of
a thriving hub of international economic
interest. This area of West Bengal is a high-tech
corridor on the edge of Kolkata (Calcutta) - see the map at:

Bird flu-infected poultry culled
------------------------------------
The health department in Islamabad detected bird
flu at 2 more poultry farms in Sihala and culled
4000 chickens, Daily Times learnt on Thursday [24
May 2007]. The authorities found bird flu at 3
poultry farms in Chak Shahzad on Wednesday [23
May 2007] and 12 000 chickens were culled.
Special teams have been formed to visit the affected poultry farms.
National Institute of Health Director General
Masood Anwar told Daily Times that there had been
no human bird flu virus cases so far. He said the
Health Ministry was monitoring the situation and
would take immediate steps if the virus spread.
He added that the NIH [Pakistan National
Institute of Health] had tested 3 men for bird
flu but the results were negative.
An official of the Ministry of Livestock said
that 16 000 chickens had been culled so far to avoid the spread of bird flu.
