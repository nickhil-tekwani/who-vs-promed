Thailand reported its 2nd case of [infection with] the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus on Sun [24 Jan 2016], according to the country's health minister. The virus was detected in a 71 year old Omani man traveling to Bangkok on Fri [22 Jan 2016], public health minister Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn told a news conference.

The 1st case was detected in a businessman from Oman in June last year [2015].

[Since the individual referred to in the post is Omani, one assumes he became infected in Oman, although that may not necessarily be the case if he had traveled to other locations where MERS has been detected. There is no information on whether this is a primary or secondary case. According to the ECDC, Oman ranked 6th in the number of reported MERS cases in 2015.

WHO has been notified of 1626 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV (globally). WHO has been notified of 586 deaths related to MERS-CoV since September 2012. Since September 2012, 26 countries have reported cases of MERS-CoV. (http://www.who.int/csr/don/7-january-2016-mers-oman/en/) - Mod.LK]

[2] Correction to MERS-CoV (07): Saudi Arabia 20160123.3959982

I want to believe the 'winery' in the post was most likely copied and pasted from the Avian Flu Diary and somewhat evaded the attention of the moderator(s) prior to posting. This may be due to erroneous machine translation sans informed human review. Camels in a winery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia? I checked the original Arabic post and it turns out that the 'winery' is an erroneous translation of the word that is transliterated Alkhumra, which is the name of the neighborhood where the camel market is located. We all make errors.

I and several other colleagues have worked in Alkhumra in the past while investigating Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, a tickborne flavivirus with camels definitely playing a role in its transmission to humans. Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus was also discovered by Dr Ali Zaki, who 1st isolated MERS CoV. Also not properly translated on the blog [Avian Flu Diary] is the fact that, according to the Arabic original, 11 out of 20 camels tested by the Ministry of Agriculture were positive for MERS. Though the specifics [regarding what test was] carried out were not stated, it is most likely to have been RT PCR, since it indicates the animals were shedding viruses. It is highly unlikely that virus isolation was attempted, despite a possible suggestion in the poor translation. What is highly commendable -- and can be understood from the Arabic -- is that the Ministry team will be testing the positive camels until they stop shedding the virus (PCR negative- my conclusion). As well as disinfection of all the camel yards in the market.
