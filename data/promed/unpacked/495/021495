This update reflects 14 illnesses that have been added to the outbreak investigation. There are now 110 illnesses under investigation. The Public Health Agency of Canada continues to remind Canadians to always handle raw turkey and raw chicken carefully, and to cook it thoroughly to prevent food-related illnesses like _Salmonella_ infection. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has not issued any food recall warnings related to this outbreak.

The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial and territorial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to raw turkey and raw chicken products has been identified as the likely source of the outbreak. Many of the individuals who became sick reported eating different types of turkey and chicken products before their illnesses occurred. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada.

As of 1 Oct 2019, there have been 110 confirmed cases of _S._ Reading illness investigated in the following provinces and territories: British Columbia (26), Alberta (36), Saskatchewan (8), Manitoba (24), Ontario (7), Quebec (1), New Brunswick (1), Northwest Territories (1), and Nunavut (6). Individuals became sick between April 2017 and August 2019. 32 individuals have been hospitalized. One individual has died. Individuals who became ill are between 0 and 96 years of age. The illnesses are equally distributed among males (50%) and females (50%).

The collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated due to an increase of _S._ Reading illnesses that occurred in October and November 2018. Cases have continued to be reported since the investigation was initiated. Through the use of a laboratory method called whole genome sequencing, some _Salmonella_ illnesses dating back to 2017 were identified to have the same genetic strain as the illnesses that occurred in late 2018. More than half of the illnesses under investigation occurred between October 2018 and August 2019.

It is possible that more recent illnesses may be reported in the outbreak because there is a period of time between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported to public health officials. This period of time is called the case reporting delay. In national _Salmonella_ outbreak investigations, the case reporting delay is usually between 5 and 6 weeks.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) previously investigated similar _Salmonella_ illnesses in several states that were linked to raw turkey exposure. There were some turkey products recalled in the U.S. that were associated with that outbreak. These products were not imported or distributed in the Canadian marketplace. The U.S. investigation was closed in April 2019.

Infants, children, seniors and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are more fragile. Most people who become ill from a _Salmonella_ infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

Raw turkey and raw chicken products carrying _Salmonella_ may look, smell and taste normal, so it's important to always follow safe food-handling tips if you are buying, chilling, thawing, cleaning, cooking and storing any type of raw poultry food products.

Always handle raw turkey and raw chicken carefully, and cook it thoroughly to prevent food-related illnesses like salmonellosis. You can use the following food safety tips to help protect you and your family: Always wash your hands before and after you touch raw turkey and raw chicken. Wash with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available. Always cook turkey and chicken products to a safe internal temperature that has been checked using a digital thermometer. Turkey and chicken breasts, as well as ground poultry, including turkey and chicken burgers, should always be cooked to an internal temperature of 74 C (165 F) to kill any harmful bacteria. Whole turkey and chicken should be cooked to an internal temperature of 82 C (180 F). Leftovers should be reheated to 74 C (165 F). Use a digital food thermometer to check, and place it in the thickest part of the food.

Thaw frozen raw turkey and raw chicken in the fridge. Thawing raw turkey and raw chicken at room temperature can allow bacteria to grow. Never rinse raw turkey or raw chicken before cooking it because the bacteria can spread wherever the water splashes. Use a separate plate, cutting board, utensils and kitchen tools when preparing raw turkey and raw chicken. Clean everything that has come in contact with raw turkey or raw chicken with a kitchen cleaner or bleach solution and then rinse with water: Kitchen cleaner (follow the instructions on the container) Bleach solution (5 mL household bleach to 750 mL of water). Keep raw turkey and raw chicken away from other food while shopping, storing, repackaging, cooking and serving foods. If you have been diagnosed with a _Salmonella_ infection or any other gastrointestinal illness, do not cook food for other people. Do not feed raw ground turkey or raw ground chicken to your pets. Bacteria like _Salmonella_ in raw pet food can make your pets sick. Your family also can get sick by handling the raw food or by taking care of your pet.

[_Salmonella_ are widely distributed in animals. In terms of human consumption, poultry and eggs from poultry are often the sources of human infection, but any animal product if not cooked properly is a potential source of salmonellosis. Pets including dogs, cats, birds, snakes, turtles, etc. can be sources of _Salmonella_ infection. The pets develop infection from _Salmonella_ in what they eat and excrete the bacteria in their feces. - Mod.DK
