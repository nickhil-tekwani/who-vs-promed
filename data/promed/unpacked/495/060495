The World Health Organization has confirmed that 2 children from
Indonesia's West Java province died from avian influenza virus infection,
bringing the death toll in the country to 14. Tests at a WHO-accredited
laboratory in Hong Kong supported Indonesian findings that a 13 year old
girl and her 4 year old brother died of the H5N1 strain of the virus, said
health ministry official Hariyadi Wibisono. "The results from Hong Kong
arrived earlier today and confirmed that the 2 had died of bird flu,"
Wibisono told AFP on Sat 21 Jan 2006.
Wibisono said the pair, whose deaths were only days apart, were residents
of Indramayu in West Java -- site of the 5th cluster case to date in
Indonesia -- and were in contact with dead chickens near their home. Their
15 year old sister, who was also hospitalised in the West Java capital
Bandung with bird flu symptoms, tested negative to initial tests but these
were being repeated, an official said last week.
Officials are still awaiting results of local tests, which have usually
proved reliable, on their 43 year old father, who is also being treated as
a suspected case.
Another health official, Hadi Yusuf, told AFP earlier on Saturday that an
11 year old girl also from Indramayu was being treated for suspected bird
flu in Bandung. She lived near the 2 deceased children. "Similar to the 2
deceased children, the new patient had also been in contact with dead fowl
near her house," Yusuf said, adding that local officials were testing
samples taken from the stricken girl.
