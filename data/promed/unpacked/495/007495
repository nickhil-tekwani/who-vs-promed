Action is being taken yet again to contain any spread of the [avian influenza H5N1] virus as the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) confirmed a strain of avian influenza had been found in birds in the Helsby area. It's the second reported case in a month.

Now, Cheshire West and Chester Council, Defra, APHA and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) are putting several measures in place to help prevent this from happening. This includes a 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] Protection Zone and a 10 km [approx. 6 mi] Surveillance Zone, while owners have been reminded that all poultry and captive birds in the 3 km [approx. 1.86 mi] Protection Zone must be kept inside unless otherwise directed by a veterinary inspector.

The zones restrict access to locations where birds are kept and impose restrictions on the movement of birds but don't limit access to residents or business owners.

[The 1st detection of HPAI H5N1 virus in the UK during the current, continuing epizootic was in rescued swans and captive poultry at a swan sanctuary in Worcester (England) on 15 Oct 2021. A steadily increasing number of HPAI H5N1-infected wild birds, countywide, has been reported since, followed by introductions into poultry farms, of which the most recent one is addressed in the above media report.

DEFRA published its 6th update of 'HPAI in the UK and Europe Outbreak Assessment' on 16 Dec 2021. The (16 pages) report includes a map and 2 detailed tables, presenting the outbreaks in poultry farms and in captive and wild birds as of 13 Dec 2021. The document is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1041537/hpai-europe-211213.pdf. The conclusions (abridged) follow.

"New cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds and outbreaks in poultry continue to be reported in northern Europe including in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Total numbers of migrating wild waterbirds (ducks, geese, and some swan species) may now be peaking in GB and the majority of wintering waterbirds have now arrived.

"Multiple confirmed cases of HPAI H5 in wild birds (235 to 13 Dec 2021) across a range of species, including resident sedentary species such as raptors and mute swan indicating that they had been exposed to infection in GB. Furthermore, potential bridging species such as gulls and raptors have tested positive. More wild bird HPAI H5 infections are expected including in sedentary GB species and potential bridging species. HPAI H5 will continue to circulate in both susceptible migrant water birds and sedentary bird species within the UK over the next few months, with a greater number of events likely to be observed around water bird wintering sites.

"The risk level of HPAI H5 in wild birds is therefore maintained at VERY HIGH across GB. The risk of exposure of poultry across the whole GB is maintained at MEDIUM (with low uncertainty) where good biosecurity is applied, and at HIGH (with low uncertainty) where biosecurity is suboptimal. This assessment takes into consideration the Avian Influenza Protection Zone (AIPZ) and assumes that bird keepers are taking the additional biosecurity measures required.

"On 24 Nov 2021, the Chief Veterinary Officers for England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland announced housing measures, which came into force on 29 Nov 2021. It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers to keep their birds indoors, to exclude contact with wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease".
