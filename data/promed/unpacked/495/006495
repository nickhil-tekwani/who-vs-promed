[Following a cholera outbreak in the town of Mandera,] at least 3
people have died, among them a 4-year-old girl. Six others are
admitted at Mandera district hospital.
Area medical officer, Dr. Hassan Adan, says a team of medical
personnel has been dispatched to the affected areas in a bid to bring
the situation under control. Hassan said samples were sent to the
National public health laboratory where the results [were] positive
for cholera.
He said the 3 people died before samples had tested positive for the
highly contagious disease. The officer said the ministry will
intensify a public awareness campaign and appealed to members of the
public to cooperate in order to bring the disease under control.

[2] Cholera - Kenya (Rift Valley Province)

Health workers have been dispatched to a village in Turkana South
following a cholera outbreak that the International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) says has killed 10 people. But speaking in Nakuru,
the Rift Valley provincial medical chief, Dr Simon Kibias, said only
3 deaths had been confirmed.
An ICRC official based in Turkwel, who preferred to remain anonymous,
said the outbreak had claimed 10 lives in the past week. "The victims
succumbed after severe bouts of diarrhea and vomiting. Villagers have
told us that they have buried 10 bodies and taken dozens others
infected to hospital," said the official.
Health workers at Nakwamoru Catholic Mission Hospital said they were
treating 20 cholera patients.
The village is 70 km. (43.5 miles) from Marich, in West Pokot
District, where the disease recently killed 11 people. Villagers in
West Pokot and Turkana districts share the Muruny River, whose water
was suspected to be the cause of the outbreak.
Large populations from the 2 districts have no access to clean water.
Following the West Pokot outbreak, health authorities ordered the
closure of eating-places and warned residents to stop using the
river. But residents have to walk [a long distance] to the few
boreholes available.
