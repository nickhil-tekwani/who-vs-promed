An elementary school student in Medicine Hat, Alberta has been diagnosed with a rare, potentially fatal bacterial disease called diphtheria.

Health officials say the Elm Street School student had not been travelling outside Canada and is not known to have been in contact with anyone else diagnosed with the disease.

Officials say diphtheria is treatable with antibiotics and preventable through immunization. Alberta Health Services says the child has not required hospitalization.

The province sent a letter to parents of Elm Street School students on Tuesday [19 Jun 2018].

Dr. Lizette Elumir, medical officer of health, says no others at the school have had to be isolated, and the risk to the public is very low. "We have already contacted and managed every presumed contact," she said.

Diphtheria symptoms can include sore throat, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, bloody nasal discharge and fever.

This diphtheria case raises the issue of some people choosing not to vaccinate their children, said Elumir. The vaccine is effective, but there is waning immunity over time. Some people may need a booster shot every 10 years.

Alberta Health Services says there were no cases of diphtheria in Alberta between 2008 and 2016. In 2017, there was one case in Edmonton and another in Calgary.

[Diphtheria became nationally notifiable in Canada in 1924, and that year, 9057 cases were reported, the highest annual number of cases ever recorded in Canada (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/diphtheria/health-professionals.html).

The diphtheria vaccine was introduced in 1926. Routine immunization in infancy and childhood has been widely practiced in Canada since 1930. By the mid-1950s, routine immunization had resulted in a remarkable decline in the morbidity and mortality of the disease. Another steep decline in cases occurred in 1980, which has been attributed, in part, to a change in case definition to exclude carriers from reported cases in all provinces and territories. Since 1993, a total of 19 cases have been reported with a range of 0 to 4 cases annually (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/vaccine-preventable-diseases/diphtheria/health-professionals.html).

Although Canada is a member of the PAHO and PAHO reported no cases of diphtheria in Canada in 2017, the news report above says that 2 cases occurred in the Canadian province of Alberta in 2017, one case in Edmonton and another in Calgary, and WHO says that 4 diphtheria cases were reported in Canada in 2017 (http://apps.who.int/immunization_monitoring/globalsummary/timeseries/tsincidencediphtheria.html). WHO case definition for reporting diphtheria only includes clinical respiratory diphtheria. However, the Canadian case definition includes both respiratory diphtheria and infection at another site (e.g. wound, cutaneous) (https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/reports-publications/canada-communicable-disease-report-ccdr/monthly-issue/2009-35/definitions-communicable-diseases-national-surveillance/diphtheria.html). Perhaps the discrepancies in numbers of diphtheria cases in Canada are due to cutaneous diphtheria. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Cutaneous diphtheria is contagious and can be a source of both respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts, and acquisition of _Coryneacterium diphtheriae_, the cause of diphtheria, can occur even in vaccinated contacts, since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin. Between 1998 and 2007, _C. diphtheriae_ was isolated from cultures of wounds of 37 patients associated with injection drug use and poverty in Vancouver's urban core (http://jcm.asm.org/content/49/7/2664.full).

In the U.S., the case definition for reporting to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System includes only respiratory diphtheria (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/diphtheria/case-definition/2010/). Although no longer reportable, cutaneous diphtheria still occurs in the U.S.; it has also been most often associated with homelessness, poor sanitation, poverty, and crowded living conditions (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/dip.html). - Mod.ML
