Involvement of Ugandan Army in Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak?
----------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: As the number of Ebola hemorrhagic fever cases continues to rise,
Uganda's Ministry of Health has called on the military to restrict the
movement of soldiers from the northern district of Gulu, where up to 87
deaths had been reported as of last week. This follows the death of 2
soldiers who were confirmed to have been infected with Ebola hemorrhagic
fever virus over the past 3 weeks.
This development means that investigations into the origin of the Ebola
hemorrhagic fever outbreak may be widened to include the army, especially
Ugandan soldiers returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The
army seems to be alarmed about the epidemic and has requisitioned large
supplies of gloves, detergents and other protective gear from the Ministry
of Health. It has also dispatched teams of investigators to trace the
movements of the 20-year-old private, who died on 27 Oct 2000 in Gulu.
Last week, the army called in the Ministry of Health to monitor 15 soldiers
who had participated in the burial of this soldier, who died in Kampala and
was buried in Mbarara. The 15 were isolated at Mulago Hospital after they
developed high fever. The soldier, who was said to have died of ulcer while
vomiting blood, was reported to have travelled from Gulu to Makenke
military barracks in Mbarara. He was a returnee from DRC. "We got the
impression that this soldier was an imported case, either from Gulu or the
DRC," Dr Sam Okware, the Director of Health Services responsible for
community health, said. "All his 11 [+15? contacts were warned and we are
keeping them under surveillance."
Observers point out that the outbreak first broke out in areas close to
army barracks. The Acholi parliamentary group has nominated legislator
Okello Okello to sit on the National Task Force on the Ebola fever
outbreak, with the express objective of asking the army to [clarify the
situation. But experts have argued that the theory that Ugandan soldiers
returning from the Congo could have brought the Ebola virus into the
country was doubtful, as there have been no new cases reported in the DRC
since the last outbreak in Kikwit in 1995. Dr Okware said that the source
of the outbreak had not been confirmed, and added that [the virus was very
similar to a strain circulating previously in Sudan. However, he added
that Sudan was not necessarily the source of the current outbreak virus.
By Sat 11 Nov 2000, 87 people out of 269 reported cases had died from the
deadly virus. The mortality rate still stands at about 36 per cent. 149
people have recovered and have been discharged from hospital. According to
Dr Okware, the number of new cases has now dropped from an average of 8 per
day in the first 2 weeks to 4 per day last week.
