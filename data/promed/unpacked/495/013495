York Region public health officials are investigating an outbreak of
cyclosporiasis, the same intestinal parasitic infection that led Canada to
ban Guatemalan raspberries last year. Bill Mindell, director of infectious
diseases control with the York Region Health Service, said Tuesday he is
working with public health officials to determine the cause of this latest
outbreak.
Laboratory tests have confirmed four cases. They have been traced to a
private function in late May. Mindell wouldn't say what the event was or
where it was held, only that several hundred people attended.
Cyclospora [infection is spread by consuming contaminated foods or
liquids. The possible sources of the parasite that infects the small
intestine include fresh fruits and vegetables. The parasite is tiny and
hides in the fruit's hairy, textured surface, making it difficult to detect.
It takes about a week for symptoms to [develop. The most common is watery
diarrhea, but other symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss and
stomach cramps.
In 1998, 329 people in Ontario, about half of them in the Toronto area,
became infected with the intestinal disease.
