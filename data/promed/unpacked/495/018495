[We have had two reponses to the previous posting about reported deaths of
humans in New Guinea; they conflict. One suggests a real world cause, one
suggests sorcery. As attempted sorcery is no less real than attempted
diagnosis, the reports are combined. - Mod.CHC]
[1]
[Digested] report by Dr Stephen Flew, Senior Medical Office, Ok Tedi Mining
Ltd, (written for Papua New Guinea Department of Health); Re: Outbreak of
unknown disease /excess deaths, Sandaun Province
[Investigation] indicated the [people] at Tapsie village were mostly
affected by the usual skin afflictions common to the area such as grille
(tinea imbicata), tropical ulcers, yaws, etc. as well as malaria,
filariasis, tropical splenomegaly and pneumonia. However there did not
appear to be any excess of morbidity or mortality at this time, nor during
the drought. [The investigators] were told that the most affected areas were
Urapmin and Ibikmen but that people had fled their usual dwellings due to
fear of sorcery and were living in bush houses. They were strongly advised
not to go to these areas on foot by the people at Yapsie, because of the
dangers of sorcery. The team were willing to go into Urapmin by chopper so
we flew them [there], accompanied by a local guide. The main village of
Urapmin appeared deserted so we proceeded up the Aki river to an isolated
hamlet and managed to land the chopper on a tiny beach in a nearby creek.
There seemed to be about 20-30 people living here, many covered in "grille"
and with swollen bellies but seemed to be saying they were all OK, as far as
I could make out above the noise of the chopper. The terrain here is very
broken and mountainous and I believe these people must be in a chronic state
of poor health, with no ready access to any form of health care. There did
not appear to have been any deaths there but we left a team behind to
investigate further.
The other team (from the Health Dept. in Vanimo) had gone to Ibikmin
village. When we arrived they had already left; apparently there were no
problems there either.
We proceeded to another isolated hamlet on a heavily forested ridge, known
as Finyaksolmin. The second team had only just arrived the night before and
had had no chance to check the local population yet. They were told there
had been no deaths here but 2 people had died at nearby Firayabamin, one
older woman of COAD [?] and a young man of malaria (?).
Back at Yapsie [the health worker] who had been left in charge for the last
few months reported that health-wise things [were bad but] hadn't really got
any worse during the drought, with a high prevalence of childhood
malnutrition (30-50%) and many patients with chronic anaemia and
hepatosplenomegaly (secondary to filariasis and malaria). There is a high
proportion of refugees now residing amongst the locals at Yapsie who have
[come] from over the border with Irian Jaya (just 10 kms away). The
presence of the refugees in an already marginally productive environment
exacerbates the malnutrition problem, and malnutrition is accepted as the
norm for growing children. No doubt the maternal, infant and childhood
mortality rates must be amongst the highest in PNG, even under normal
climatological conditions. Even in October Yapsie appeared fairly green and
not much affected by drought. Now the Sepik river is in flood and there is
little evidence of drought except for the extensive bushfires in the high
country between here and Tabubil.
A review of the Health Centre monthly reports at Yapsie indicates there was
not much change in outpatient illness rates for the common conditions of
cough, pneumonia, other respiratory disease, diarrhoea, malaria, anaemia,
yaws and other skin diseases during October-November (total of 1200
attendances each month). During the first 3 weeks of December there appears
to have been an increase in malaria, 'flu, diarrhoea and skin diseases (the
latter esp. from Munbil, ?some ulcers requiring skin grafts). However there
has been no increase in deaths recorded at Yapsie and the [administrator]
from Fiak was also surprised to hear of the 10 deaths which were reported
from his area, none of which he was aware of.
It would appear that the lay reporting of 19 deaths and 24-30 people
critically ill or comatose in the Yapsie and Fiak subdistricts of Telefomin
has been grossly exaggerated. The reporting of these deaths may have come
about due to the rumours of sorcery and the confusion arising from the
abandonment of villages in the area. [He goes on to suggest that additional
resources be made available to these isolated communities so that the
incidence of filariasis, malaria, and other vector-borne diseases could be
reduced.]

We thank you for the attention and consideration on what happen in Irian
Jaya, especially in the highland of Jayawijaya.
The El Nino has affected the area to cause the drought since April 1997. It
seems that the situation has incerased the temperature in the highland. Our
consideration is in the area above 1,700 m (5,000 feet) from sea level,
which [has seen] several changes on the ecosystem.
We have clinically and laboratory confirmed that cerebral malaria has been
found in that area (Lolat, Weawen, and Kabianggema, these three villages are
not in the border of Papua New Guinea). Malaria are common in Irian Jaya;
however, it was amazing because the disease had never been found [at that
altitude]. A recent investigation by a team of entomologists,
epidemiologists, and clinical laboratorians found that the _Anopheles
punctulatus_ [?] has climbed up to higher altitude.
Blood smear examination from 52 [people in the?] high prevalence area had
also confirmed that plasmodium infections were responsible for the
mysterious disease. The parasite rate had been found 31.9% - 98.21% among
the suffering patients.
These villages listed below are endemic [for] malaria and are on the border
of Papua New Guinea :

Village Parasite rate
Pepera 98.21%
Bulangkop 81.71%
Mimin 54.17%
Kabiding 31.90%
Oknagul 70.00%
Currently, the rate has decreased to 2% after a radical mass treatment with
chloroquine.
An investigation is being conducted at village Okyop (a village close to
Yapsie of Papua New Guinea), since it was reported that same problem arise
there. We hope that the laboratory result (blood smear) can be confirmed
within a week.

[So, we have a situation in which many serious infectious diseases are
endemic and the current hypotheses are (1) there is no excess morbidity or
mortality but (2) primitive beliefs are driving rumors of such illnesses and
deaths and (3) there is cerebral malaria in the area but that it is being
treated properly and successfully. We likely will not get to a diagnostic
resolution of this situation. - Mod.CHC]
