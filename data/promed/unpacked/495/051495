Rabies in Kerala
----------------
The newspaper Malayala Manorama reported on Sun 20 Nov 2005 the
deaths of 2 cows due to rabies; 5 cows bitten by a rabid dog are
undergoing treatment [either immediate slaughter or, probably, wound
treatment followed by the prescribed isolation for 6 months? -
Mod.AS]. All were in one township in Trivandrum district.
The deaths of 4 persons due to rabies were reported in different
parts of Kerala (one in Trivandrum district) on 7 Apr, 7 Jun, 1 Jul
& 6 Sep 2005.
Rabid dog bites have been reported frequently in several towns in
Kerala during recent months (and years). I recall the reports on one
tourist from Germany and another from the UK who developed rabies
after returning from India in 2005.
Visitors must seek medical attention immediately [if bitten] by any
animal. The best First Aid is washing the wound with soap and copious
amounts of water. This must be done within minutes of the bite. When
visiting a medical facility, they should specifically ask for rabies
prophylaxis. Those who can take pre-exposure rabies immunization
should consider this option with their doctor prior to travel to
rabies-endemic countries.
