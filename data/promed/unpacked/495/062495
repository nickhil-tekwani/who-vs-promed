In a tragic incident, a 16-year-old girl died after eating chicken from a hotel in Kerala's Kasargod, while 31 others, who had consumed food from the same restaurant on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday [29-30 Apr and 1 May 2022], were admitted to various hospitals in the district with food poisoning symptoms, officials said. The girl, identified as [D] of Karivellur in Kannur district, had eaten a 'chicken shawarma' on Friday [29 Apr 2022] from the 'Idea Food Point' at Neeleswaram in Kasargod.

State Food and Civil Supplies Department in a statement said the hotel, functioning without proper license from the department, has been sealed and the district collector directed to conduct an investigation. State Health Minister Veena George has ordered a comprehensive inquiry into the incident.

Senior CPI-M leader and Urban Affairs and Excise Minister M V Govindan told IANS [Indo-Asian News Service] the government will conduct an investigation in all food outlets across the state, adding, "... government will not allow such things to happen in the state of Kerala." He said the government will take steps to ensure quality food is provided to the consumers at hotels and said stringent action will be taken against erring hoteliers who are functioning without a license and failing to provide quality and healthy food to consumers.

[We are sorry for the family of the person who died.

There are no clinical signs listed, so it is impossible to hypothesize about the cause of the food-borne situation. It may have been a spoiled food, or an insecticide, or a bacterial toxin. There is not enough information to formulate a supposition. Hopefully more information will be forthcoming. - Mod.TG
