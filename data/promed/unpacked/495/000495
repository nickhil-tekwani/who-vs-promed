Local populations of native white-clawed crayfish have been suffering in the Cinderford and Soudley Brook area.

It is thought an infectious 'crayfish plague' is sweeping the local area, leading to an investigation by Forestry England and the Environment Agency.

Crayfish plague is species-specific and cannot be transferred to humans but the fungal spores responsible for the disease can survive on damp surfaces for 22 days.

White-clawed crayfish look like miniature lobsters and prefer to hide away under rocks and logs during the day before emerging during the night to eat.

The crayfish are the largest native, freshwater invertebrate in Britain but are now a rare and endangered species following competition with non-native crayfish.

Once crayfish plague is present in a watercourse, the white-clawed crayfish will usually all succumb to the disease.

It usually takes several weeks as the fungus is spread by contact between individual white-clawed crayfish through the water or contact with infected mud.

The disease can be transferred to crayfish in other parts of the catchment via water and mud on damp clothes, footwear, bike tyres, vehicle tyres, fishing or boating equipment or any machinery, or by dogs, horses or livestock.

[Crayfish fungal plague, fatal to many crayfish species, has affected many European countries. It is caused by a fungus _Aphanomyces astaci_ that was brought into Europe by the introduction of _Procambarus clarkii_, a freshwater crayfish species from Lousiana, USA, which is naturally infected by this pathogen, although it does not develop clinical disease.

The white-clawed crayfish, _Austropotamobius pallipes_ is an endangered European freshwater crayfish, and the only species of crayfish native to the British Isles. For a picture see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austropotamobius_pallipes#/media/File:Austropotamobius_pallipes.jpg.

For detailed information about the disease caused by this fungus see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/chapitre_aphanomyces_astaci.pdf. - Mod. PMB
