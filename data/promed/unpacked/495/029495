New influenza A (H1N1) virus: global epidemiological situation, June 2009
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
On [11 Jun 2009], the World Health Organization
(WHO) raised the level of pandemic alert from
phase 5 to phase 6, indicating that an influenza
pandemic is under way, (ref 1) the 1st in 41
years. Phase 6 is characterized by sustained
human-to-human transmission caused by
community-level outbreaks in at least 1 country
in 2 WHO regions. Designation of this phase
indicates that containment of the virus to a
particular geographical area is no longer
possible. During previous pandemics, influenza
viruses took greater than 6 months to spread as
widely as the new influenza A (H1N1) pandemic
virus has taken to spread in less than 6 weeks
since the 1st cases were detected in California
(USA) in 2009. (ref 2)

This report summarizes the global epidemiological
situation of new influenza A (H1N1) virus as of
[11 Jun 2009]. The descriptive epidemiology of
the pandemic presented in this report includes
the distribution by age and sex of laboratory
confirmed cases, the geographical spread of the
pandemic virus, global and regional transmission
patterns, morbidity and mortality patterns, and
information about the co-circulation of new A
(H1N1) virus and seasonal influenza viruses in
selected countries.

Methods
-------
The WHO has compiled data from case-based and
aggregated reports on human cases of new
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection provided to
the Organization by States Parties under the
International Health Regulations (2005), (ref 3)
published reports and from information posted on
the official websites of national health
authorities, including media releases. The case
definitions used in this report can be found in
the Interim WHO guidance for the surveillance of
human infection with new influenza A (H1N1)
virus. (ref 4)

The terminology used in this report reflects the
indicators of influenza activity recommended by
the WHO for global surveillance in pandemic phase
6 and during subsequent waves of disease
activity. The WHO has developed epidemiological
and virological indicators of influenza activity
to monitor the evolution of the pandemic. (ref 5)

Geographical spread refers to the number and
distribution of sites reporting influenza
activity. Transmission describes the pattern of
spread within countries. Intensity is an estimate
of the overall level of respiratory disease
activity in the population. Trend refers to the
level of respiratory disease activity as a proxy
for influenza activity (increasing, unchanged or
decreasing) over time. Impact refers to the
degree of disruption of health-care services as a
result of influenza virus activity.

Geographical spread and transmission dynamics
---------------------------------------------
Map 1 shows the global distribution of cases of
new influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. As of [11
Jun 2009], 28 119 laboratory-confirmed cases,
including 144 deaths, had been reported to the
WHO from Canada (4), Chile (2), Costa Rica (1),
the Dominican Republic (1), Mexico (108),
Colombia (1) and the United States (27) [see
Table 1 available at above given URL link].
Although 74 countries in 5 WHO regions have been
affected, approximately 90 percent of reported
cases have occurred in the Americas. Outside of
North America, the majority of cases have been
reported by Chile (6.1 percent of total cases),
Australia (4.4 percent), the United Kingdom (2.4
percent), Japan (1.8 percent), Spain (1.2
percent), and Panama (0.8 percent). No cases have
been reported from any of the 46 countries in the
WHO African Region [since this report was
prepared, South Africa has recently confirmed its
1st case and is included in the case count
summary presented above and there is a newswire
report mentioning Ethiopia has confirmed its 1st
2 cases and is presented in the news brief
section below. - Mod.MPP].

International travel has facilitated the
geographical spread of new influenza A (H1N1)
virus from the initial foci of infection in
Mexico and the United States to many countries
throughout the world, seeding urban centres (refs
6,7) with a high intensity of transmission before
wider geographical spread within countries.
Recent international travel remains an important
risk factor for disease. As of [3 Jun 2009],
approximately 50 percent of the cases (n equal to
415) reported among European Union countries were
associated with travel to Mexico (n equal to 133)
or the United States (n equal to 90) in the week
before the onset of symptoms. Since [1 Jun 2009],
the Health Protection Agency (United Kingdom) has
observed a sharp increase in the proportion of
locally-acquired infections in the UK. (ref 8)
This pattern is being observed in other countries
with a rapidly evolving epidemic. In Canada,
among 1630 cases reported as of [4 Jun 2009],
only 182 (10.7 [percent) had a history of travel
in the 7 days prior to symptom onset. (ref 9)

Most countries, with the exception of Mexico, are
reporting an increasing trend in the number of
cases [see Table 1 available at above given URL
link). These countries are describing in-country
differences in patterns and intensity of
transmission of new influenza A(H1N1) virus at
the sub-national level, with reports of zero
cases, imported cases only, limited local
transmission associated with institutional
outbreaks, notably schools (e.g., Australia(ref
10), Chile(ref 7), 14 countries within the WHO
European Region(ref 11), Japan(ref 12), the
Philippines(ref 13) and the United States(ref 6))
to widespread and sustained community-level
transmission (Canada, Chile, Mexico and the
United States). Australia has reported sustained
community-level transmission (ref 14) in the
state of Victoria while all other jurisdictions
are reporting local transmission. Approximately
40 percent (666/1521) of the laboratory-confirmed
cases in Europe for whom an exposure history was
obtainable resulted from local transmission.

Estimates of the basic reproduction number
------------------------------------------
Early estimates of the basic reproduction number
(R0) for new influenza A(H1N1) virus are in the
range of 1.4-1.6, while a genetic analysis gave a
central estimate of 1.2.(ref 15) Transmissibility
is considered to be substantially higher than for
seasonal influenza and is comparable with lower
estimates of R0 calculated from estimates for the
1918 influenza pandemic of 2-3(ref 16). A study
in Japan estimates the R0 to be as high as 2.3,
with a mean generation time of 1.3-4.0 days(ref
17). As the R0 is higher than previously
reported, the authors suggest that high contact
rates among adolescents compared with other
populations may be one of the main drivers of the
2009 pandemic. Further modelling is under way to
better describe transmission dynamics during the
explosive outbreaks seen in school settings.

Distribution of cases by age and sex
------------------------------------
To date, the vast majority of cases in all
countries have occurred among adolescents and
young adults. Males and females are similarly
affected in all countries.

Early cases were associated with students and
recent travel to Mexico and the United States
during the Spring holidays in the northern
hemisphere. Fig. 1 [Figure 1. Median age, by
range, of human cases of new influenza A (H1N1)
virus infection reported to the WHO, by country
(data as of 11 Jun 2009) is available at the
above given URL link] shows the median age and
range of cases reported to WHO from selected
countries as of [11 Jun 2009].

Data compiled by the WHO from Chile, countries of
the European Union and the European Free Trade
Association, Japan, Panama and Mexico indicate
that approximately 25 percent of cases were aged
0-9 years, 36 percent were aged 10-19 years, 17
percent were aged 20-29 years, 9 percent were
aged 30-39 years, 7 percent were aged 40-49 years
and 5 percent were aged greater than 50 years. In
Canada (ref 9), among cases for whom information
was available (n equal to 1695), 5.9 percent were
aged 0-4 years, 10.6 percent aged 5-9 years, 57.8
percent aged 10-29 years and 0.7 percent greater
than 65, with a median age of 17 years (range,
less than 1-80 years). In Chile, the median age
is 13 years (range 1-65 years). In Japan,
approximately 80 percent of cases are aged
between 10 and 19 years. In the Philippines, most
of the cases occurred among those aged 5-24 years
(range, 1-64 years), and in the UK the median age
of cases is 12 years (mean 20 years, range 0-73
years).

As of 21 May 2009, the median age of cases in
countries reporting to the WHO European Region
(ref 18) was 24 years (range 0-69 years). Overall
in the WHO Western Pacific Region, the median age
of the approximately 215 cases for whom age is
known is 23 years (inter-quartile range 18-30
years).

At this stage of the pandemic, it remains unclear
whether younger age groups are over-represented
among reported cases given the increased
susceptibility in younger, immunologically naive
populations, the fact that there has been
insufficient time for the virus to fully
penetrate beyond the social networks of known
cases or that there are biases in disease
surveillance.

Global morbidity and mortality
------------------------------
Globally, most cases have been mild, although
severe disease has been reported both among known
groups at higher risk of adverse outcomes
following influenza and in previously healthy
young adults, leading the WHO to classify the
severity of this pandemic to date as "moderate."
In Kobe City (Japan)(ref 12), of the 49
laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the WHO as
of 25 May 2009, most patients recovered quickly
from their illness. The duration of onset and
resolution of fever was 1- 8 days (median, 3
days).

Hospitalization
---------------
The United States (refs 19,20), Mexico (ref 19),
Canada, Chile, Panama, Scotland and Australia
have reported cases requiring hospitalization for
the medical care of new influenza A (H1N1) virus
infection rather than for diagnosis and
quarantine. In the United States, of 399 patients
with laboratory confirmed new A (H1N1) influenza
infection identified as of 5 May 2009 and for
whom hospitalization status was known, 36 (9
percent) required hospitalization. Of the 22
hospitalized patients for whom data were
available, 4 (18 percent) were aged less than 5
years, 1 patient (4 percent) was pregnant and 9
patients (41 percent) had co-morbidities (ref 21).

As of [11 Jun 2009], the New York City Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene (USA) had notified
567 hospital admissions and 16 deaths. The
hospitalized patients were younger than those who
would normally experience severe illness during
seasonal influenza outbreaks; approximately 79
percent of patients were aged less than 50 years;
46 percent were aged less than 18 years and 20
percent were aged less than 5; only 5 percent of
hospitalized cases were aged greater than 65
years (ref 22).

As of 30 May 2009, the Ministry of Health of
Canada (ref 9) had notified 84 hospital
admissions. The median age of hospitalized
patients was 17 years (range, 1-78 years), 13 of
whom (15.5 percent) were admitted to intensive
care. Information regarding underlying medical
conditions is available for 40 (47.6 percent) of
hospitalized cases, 12 of whom (30.0 percent) had
underlying medical conditions including lung
disease, chronic heart disease and other
underlying co-morbidities (ref 9). One
hospitalized patient was pregnant.

In Chile, 1.7 percent of total
laboratory-confirmed cases (29/1694) required
hospitalization (ref 7).

As of [8 Jun 2009], of 291 cases reported to WHO
from countries of the European Union and the
European Free Trade Association, 105 patients (36
percent) required hospitalization. In several
countries (including Austria, Belgium, France and
Romania), cases were hospitalized for isolation
purposes(ref 23).

As of [11 Jun 2009], the WHO Western Pacific
Region had notified 116 hospitalizations among
1077 cases (11 percent) for whom data were
available; however, it is unclear what proportion
of patients were admitted for severe disease. No
hospitalizations have been reported by countries
in the WHO South-East Asia Region or the WHO
Eastern Mediterranean Region.

Co-morbidities
--------------
Although a large proportion of cases have been
reported as having greater than 1 underlying
health condition (such as asthma, cardiovascular
disease and pregnancy) (ref 24), the true extent
of co-morbidities on the severity of disease is
currently under investigation in several
countries. Of the 567 hospitalized patients in
New York City (ref 22), 80 percent had at least 1
known risk factor for severe illness or
complications due to influenza. Asthma is the
most common risk factor, present in 41 percent of
all laboratory-confirmed hospitalized cases.
Other important risk factors include pregnancy
(28 percent of 142 women of childbearing age
hospitalized with confirmed disease), children
aged less than 2 years (12 percent) and patients
with diabetes (11 percent), immunodeficiency (9
percent) and cardiovascular disease (9 percent).

Community-based studies
-----------------------
A community-based telephone survey in New York
City (USA) has estimated that 6.9 percent of the
population developed an influenza-like illness
during 1-20 May 2009. The city-wide survey found
district-level differences in the prevalence of
this illness ranging from 9.4 percent to 3.6
percent of respondents. While not all those with
influenza-like illness had new influenza A (H1N1)
virus infection, these results suggest that
infections caused by A (H1N1) were common at that
time.

Secondary household attack rates
--------------------------------
The rates of secondary attack of seasonal
influenza range from 5 percent to 15 percent.
Current estimates of the secondary household
attack rates of new influenza A (H1N1) range from
22 percent to 33 percent.

Impact on health services of new influenza A (H1N1) virus infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------
To date, the overall impact of new influenza A
(H1N1) virus infection on health-care services in
Canada, Chile, Mexico and the United States is
considered to be low. However, the impact on some
sub-national health services has been moderate
(that is, the demands on health-care services
have caused some stress to systems above usual
levels, but below maximum capacity [PAHO,
unpublished data, 2009].

Co-circulation of new influenza A (H1N1) virus and seasonal influenza viruses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The impact of seasonality on the circulation and
severity of new influenza A (H1N1) virus is an
important and unanswered question. Although it is
still too early to draw conclusions, several
influenza surveillance systems have provided
evidence of new influenza A (H1N1) virus and
seasonal influenza viruses co-circulating in
Australia, Canada, Chile, Europe, Mexico and the
United States.

In Chile, new influenza A (H1N1) virus is
replacing the circulating seasonal influenza
viruses (ref 25). By the end of May 2009, 90
percent of influenza isolates tested were found
to be new A (H1N1) influenza virus; that
proportion was 65 percent of isolates in the week
ending [2 Jun 2009].

Based on the antigenic and/or genetic
characterization of 3548 influenza viruses
reported to the European Influenza Surveillance
Scheme up to epidemiological week 23, only 18
(0.5 percent) were characterized as new influenza
A (H1N1) virus (see
<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi>).
In the United States, new influenza A (H1N1)
virus accounted for 77.8 percent (2071) of the
2663 influenza A viruses characterized during
epidemiological week 22 (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/>).

WER Editorial note
------------------
For the 2009 pandemic influenza virus, the WHO
has observed the following preliminary
epidemiological patterns:
- younger age groups are more affected than those
affected during outbreaks of seasonal influenza;
- although global geographical spread is
extensive, transmission remains relatively
localized for most countries.

As expected, uncertainties remain, including the
changes over time of the clinical, virological
and epidemiological characteristics of the virus
and the impact of seasonality on these
parameters. To answer these and other critical
questions, epidemiological data collected through
pandemic monitoring and special studies are
urgently needed and will require:
- early detection of the virus in previously unaffected countries or areas;
- monitoring trends in countries/areas with established outbreaks;
- monitoring changes in the characteristics of
the virus (virulence, susceptibility to antiviral
agents and evidence of further genetic
re-assortment) that could impact clinical case
management and public health measures for
mitigation;
- regular assessment of the severity of the disease;
- special studies to capture data on the
extremely mild end of the clinical spectrum and
asymptomatic cases to describe the true extent of
new influenza A (H1N1) virus spread and better
describe key epidemiological and virological
characteristics.

Limitations of the data
-----------------------
Variations among countries in the case
definitions and surveillance methods used to
detect cases of new A (H1N1) virus infection
suggest that there is significant
under-reporting, with surveillance systems not
designed to detect all cases. In many countries,
initial cases have been detected through
screening upon entry of airline passengers,
targeted testing of travellers developing
symptoms of influenza-like illness after
returning from affected countries and the
investigation of outbreaks of such illnesses in
schools. Asymptomatic and mild cases are likely
to be missed.

The use of travel to an affected country to
identify suspected cases of human infection with
influenza A (H1N1) virus infection is limited by
the speed of spread of the new virus. The current
distribution of affected countries is also likely
to reflect variations in surveillance systems and
laboratory capacity. Furthermore, many of the
intensive case-finding activities have been
related to the follow-up of contacts of school
outbreaks and therefore reported cases at this
stage of the pandemic may be biased towards
identifying cases in school-aged children.

Lessons learnt from past pandemics
----------------------------------
Findings from an evaluation of past pandemics
suggest that influenza viruses are unpredictable
and that epidemiological patterns will vary
within and among countries and during the
different waves of pandemics (ref 26). All
governments and the international community will
need to adapt to the changing dynamics of the
situation. The timely sharing of information will
be a critical component in supporting global
mitigation efforts in the coming months and years.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[As of 07:00 GMT+2 today [19 Jun 2009] there have
been a total of 44 287 cases with 180 deaths
attributable to influenza A (H1N1) infection
confirmed to the WHO from 87 countries. In
addition, according to newswires new countries
reporting cases since the release of the daily
WHO summary include Ethiopia and Slovenia. There
are now 2 countries in the WHO African region
that have confirmed cases -- Ethiopia and South
Africa.

The epidemiologic review published in today's WHO
Weekly Epidemiologic Record provides a very nice
overview of the descriptive epidemiology of the
influenza A (H1N1) activity as known through
surveillance activities around the world. The
stated limitations of the data are consistent
with what this moderator has mentioned in
previous commentaries -- that there is most
likely significant under-reporting of cases due
to a combination of factors. As stated above,
surveillance activities and criteria for case
identification are varied country by country. In
countries where surveillance activities are
considered to be relatively strong, the
overwhelming majority of cases have been
described as mild and self limited, suggesting
that many cases might not come to the attention
of the health sector. In many countries there has
been a reliance upon identifying travellers in
airports upon arrival in the country, so there is
room for missing those individuals who may be
infected but as yet asymptomatic.

The statistics mentioned in the Epidemiological
situation report that 50 percent of confirmed
cases in the European Union countries, with other
countries elsewhere showing the same pattern
should be viewed with caution, as many countries
have initially focused surveillance activities on
febrile travelers entering the countries through
air travel. Hence, this moderator's favorite
adage of "seek and ye shall find" has resulted in
seeking the disease among travelers and thereby
finding the disease among travelers.

The observation that the younger population is
over-represented among reported cases, the WHO
report cautions on drawing firm conclusions,
signalling the possibility of early bias towards
detecting younger cases (through comprehensive
investigations of school outbreaks), and a
possible early bias of transmission in the
younger age group social networks, which may
change with time. - Mod.MPP]
