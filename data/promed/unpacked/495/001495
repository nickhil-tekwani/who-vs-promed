Experts say the outbreak of yellow fever gripping Sudan is the worst the world has seen in at least 20 years. More than 800 suspected cases of the mosquito-spread disease have been reported across the Darfur region since the outbreak began in October [2012]. The virus, which can cause jaundice and kidney failure, has killed 168 people.

The World Health Organization's Anshu Banerjee said few people in Sudan were immune to it and an emergency mass vaccination campaign was now under way. The 1st phase of the immunisation programme began on 21 Nov [2012], to cover 2.2 million people, and the 2nd phase is planned for this month [December 2012], to cover an additional 1.2 million people at risk.

Dr Banerjee said another 2.2 million doses of the vaccine were expected to arrive soon. "This should be enough to protect the population in Darfur that is at risk and stop it spreading to the rest of Sudan," he said.

He said some other African countries, like Cameroon, had also reported some cases of yellow fever recently, but unlike Sudan, many of these already include the yellow fever vaccine in their childhood immunisation programmes.

"There's been no such vaccine campaign in Sudan for decades. It's because of priorities. Sudan recently identified itself as a high-risk country for a yellow fever outbreak and had conditional approval to begin a vaccination campaign. "Unfortunately the outbreak hit before this could happen. This is the worst outbreak we have seen globally in 20 years or more."

In Darfur, the disease has spread following nomadic migration routes across the region. At the moment, yellow fever is mostly restricted to rural areas. However, there is a risk that it will spread to urban areas including the camps that house up to 2 million people who fled their homes because of the Darfur conflict.

Yellow fever is endemic in tropical regions of Africa and South America. A vaccine can prevent infection but there is no specific drug treatment for people who are infected. In its most severe form it causes bleeding, jaundice and possible liver and kidney failure.

[The number of yellow fever (YF) cases and deaths continues to increase, from 732 cases and 165 deaths reported on 7 Dec 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20121208.1443535) to the more than 800 cases and 168 deaths reported today (18 Dec 2012). It is helpful to know that the 2nd phase of the campaign is planned during the remainder of this month (December 2012). The sooner the campaign begins, the less the risk of YF hitting the refugee campus, which could be extremely serious if there are abundant YF virus vector mosquitoes there. Curiously, little or no mention is made in the Darfur YF outbreak reports about the status of vector mosquito populations in the region.
