Bluetongue virus might survive the winter within foetuses
---------------------------------------------------------
Scientists in the Institute for Animal Health believe that it is a
distinct possibility that bluetongue virus survives the winter by
passing from pregnant infected ruminants to their offspring whilst in
the womb. After birth, the young animals provide biting midges (the
"vector") with a fresh source of virus when they take a blood meal.

Knowing how the virus over-winters is a vital before the 2008 vector
season gets underway, as it might be possible to introduce
preventative measures before transmission re-commences.

This is especially important in the UK where so far the virus has
been limited to a restricted area within England, largely in the
east, and may still be able to be eradicated.

"In essence we have a once-only opportunity to eliminate the virus
from the UK before it devastates our ruminant industry as it has
already done on the near continent in 2007," said professor Philip
Mellor, head of bluetongue research within the Institute for Animal Health.

The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)
has just provided financial resources to professor Mellor's team to
investigate if bluetongue virus is surviving in this way, and
potentially fuelling a 2008 outbreak.

This investigation has been prompted by recent observations in
Holland and the UK that indicate that ruminant offspring that are
weak, stillborn, and/or PCR* positive are now being born to dams that
were infected with bluetongue virus last year [2007].

Background on transplacental infection of the foetus of dams infected
during pregnancy to produce offspring with blood-borne bluetongue
virus during the next vector season
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Until recently most bluetongue scientific authorities agreed that
transplacental infection of the ruminant foetus by bluetongue virus
from a dam infected during pregnancy only occurred when
laboratory-adapted strains of virus were used. In experiments with
these strains of virus, resorption of the foetus, abortion, birth of
weak or deformed offspring ensued. Some of the offspring had
bluetongue virus in their bloodstream ("viraemic"). Work at
IAH-Pirbright in the 1970s [in sheep - Mod.AS] showed that infectious
virus was present in the offspring up to 60 days after birth. As the
dams had been infected at around 60-70 days of gestation, this means
that there was a period of approximately 145 days between infection
of the dam and end of viraemia in the lamb. Such a time would easily
cover the period from the end of one transmission season (December;
when the temperatures are too cold for midge activity and too cold
for the virus to grow in midges) to the start of the next (April;
when temperatures rise sufficiently) in the UK and elsewhere in
northern Europe. The body temperature of the midges is the same as
that of their surroundings.

*PCR, the polymerase chain reaction. This technique detects the
genetic material of the bluetongue virus, and is briefly described at

[The information in the press release above complies with
ProMED-mail's request for information, included in the posting
'Bluetongue - Europe (12): BTV-8, fetal viraemia, RFI' of 2 Mar 2008.
It illuminates the gaps in epidemiological knowledge on BTV-8 in
ovine and, particularly, in bovine, such as its effect in pregnant
animals, upon foetal development, and upon the duration of viraemia
in the foetus and in neonates. Such viraemia may have implications
upon the future spread of BTV-8 in receptive areas in Europe and
elsewhere, and upon the international trade in pregnant ruminants
from affected areas.

The work, done at IAH-Pirbright in the 1970s (see ref 1), involved
pregnant sheep, which were experimentally infected approximately 85
days before their expected full-term parturition, one born lamb
remaining viraemic up to the age of 60 days. It remains to speculate
if similar results would have been observed in other sheep breeds, in
bovines, and with a virus, which had not been passaged in the
laboratory in various species/tissue cultures, including other BTV serotypes.

It is encouraging to note that the issue is to be investigated by
IAH, applying the relevant serotype namely BTV-8 in ruminants (cattle
and sheep). If the ovine data (mean duration of pregnancy 150 days)
are translated to bovine terms (280 days), the bovine foetuses should
be infected at 130-140 day of pregnancy, namely 140-150 before
parturition. Will viraemia last that long? And is PCR (a different
technique to demonstrate the presence of the virus than the one --
virus isolation trials -- applied in the 70's) indeed indicative of
the presence of a viable, infectious, entire virus?

This important investigation should go hand-in-hand with field
observations; as previously suggested by ProMED-mail, we shall
appreciate receiving such field-collected data, in particular
relating to the effect of the virus upon fertility and embryonal
development/pathology in bovines and ovines.
