Emergency management warning 86: exotic Newcastle disease confirmed in the US
-------------------------------
All information in the following notice marked with an asterisk (*)
identifies changes since the last notice was sent out. Exotic Newcastle
disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the state of California, and
has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 22 commercial operations in
California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also confirmed in a backyard flock in
Nevada. A backyard flock was confirmed with END on 4 Feb 2003, in Arizona.
On 9 Apr 2003, END was confirmed in backyard fowl in Texas. Clinical signs
in infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs.
Mortality is up to 90 per cent of exposed birds.

Investigations are ongoing and all figures are pending final validation.
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) personnel and other
federal government personnel are working with the states to consider
additional resources to meet the labor demands at the Task Forces. APHIS
has implemented a plan for enhanced national END surveillance.

Operational Update
· Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
· Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Clark and a portion of Nye County, NV.
· Effective 10 Feb 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
all of La Paz and Yuma Counties and a portion of Mohave County, AZ.
· Effective 10 Apr 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates
the interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
all of El Paso and Hudspeth Counties, TX, and Dona Ana, Luna, and Otero
Counties, NM. The federal quarantine was placed on counties beyond the
infected county due to their proximity to the infected county. A quarantine
was placed on a portion of New Mexico because of its proximity to the
infected area in the State of Texas.
· The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, and New
Mexico. These declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within
Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas.
· Currently 22 commercial flocks in California are affected by END. The
breakdown of the commercial premises involved is as follows: 4 premises in
Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact), 7 premises in San Diego County
(7 infected), and 11 premises in San Bernardino County (11 infected).
· *Of the 2600 premises designated for depopulation, 98.1 per cent have
been completed.
· APHIS' enhanced surveillance plan includes the surveillance of 22 410
premises from the Central California Task Force, 3474 premises from the
Inland Desert Task Force, and 750 premises from the South Coast Task Force.
All of these premises currently reside outside the quarantined area in
California.
· The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA is staffed and
working cooperatively with about 15 to 20 county officials to implement
efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley.

Outreach Activities
· On a daily basis, task force personnel are communicating information
concerning surveillance, depopulation, and cleaning and disinfection
operations to all affected city managers in southern California.
· Currently, task force information personnel field about 450 calls per
week from the public through the Joint Information Center phone bank. This
is a 20-fold increase from the number of calls in October 2002. About 300
of these calls require follow-up action by the Inland Desert or South Coast
Incident Command Posts.
· The task force information staff provide daily updates to about 50 media
outlets in California. In addition, in Area Command alone, the information
staff field about 70 media calls per week.
