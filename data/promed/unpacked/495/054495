[On 28 Oct 2016, Hungary's Director of Animal Health and Animal Welfare published information on the detected case in a dead swan, in the portal (in Hungarian): http://portal.nebih.gov.hu/-/vedekezni-kell-a-madarinfluenza-ellen.

The information (as apparent from a machine translation) addressed the detection of avian influenza virus in a dead swan in NÉBIH in Csongárd County. It said that the detected serotypes (H5N8) had never been found to cause human disease. However, for the poultry flocks it is regarded a serious threat. Therefore, the Hungarian CVO conveyed to the breeders' associations the importance and need of prevention.

The Director reminded that the H5N8 strain of bird flu has caused, during the past 2 years, several epidemics in poultry populations worldwide, causing serious direct and indirect losses. Epidemiological studies suggest that migratory birds also play a role in spreading the disease. Most at risk are the waterfowl flocks, held outside most or all of the time. During the bird migration period poultry should be protected from exposure to wild birds. Preventive measures should address the safe protection of feed and water from contamination. Description of the clinical disease in bird species was included.

Subscribers are referred to FAO EMPRES Watch Vol 35 (September 2016, p 1-6; see in posting 20160920.4501532). In their article, the authors alerted all countries along the Central Asian Flyway and those to the west in the former Soviet Republics, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and even Africa (especially West Africa), about the expected incursions of "Goose/Guangdong/96 lineage H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of clade 2.3.4.4". This virus had been detected in migratory birds at Lake Ubsu-Nur in the Tyva Republic of the Russian Federation. - Mod.AS
