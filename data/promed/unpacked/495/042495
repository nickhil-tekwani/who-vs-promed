Preliminary report of serosurvey for circulation of viruses of the Simbu serogroup in dairy cattle in Israel, 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Akabane virus (AKAV) was identified in 1975 as the causative agent responsible for a major outbreak of arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly [A-H] which had affected foeti of cattle, sheep, and goats in Israel in 1969/1970. In 2001, serological evidence indicated the presence in Israel of another member of the serogroup Simbu in the genus _Orthobunyavirus_, namely the Aino virus (AINOV) (Ref 1). Another member of the group, the Shuni virus (SHUV) was isolated In Nov 2014 in northern Israel from the brain and placenta of a malformed lamb and confirmed by PCR in 7 others (Ref 2).

Subsequently, a serosurvey has been conducted cooperatively by the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) (J Brenner) and the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), Japan (T Yanase, T Kato, and T Tsuda), to screen the possible presence of other Simbu serogroup viruses in Israel.

A total of 13 dairy cattle farms in 5 districts, hotspots for _Culicoides_ activity, have been chosen. At each location, 10 adult cows and 5 heifers were sampled between July and August 2014. All sampled heifers were born after October 2013. One sheep farm was included in the survey; in this flock, Shuni virus (SHUV) had been identified by virus isolation in 2014 and by PCR in 2015 (Ref 2).

Tested at the department of Virology, KVI, all 140 adult cows were found positive by 'commercial SBV ELISA test'. (The Schmallenberg Virus Antibody Test Kit IDEXX Schmallenberg Ab; 3097 Liebefeld-Bern, Switzerland) at the 1st sampling; these adult cows were not resampled. All 75 sampled heifers were found negative at the 1st sampling. All were resampled between July and August 2014. Seroconversion was recorded in all 75 heifers.

Sera of 58 ELISA-positive bovines (19 cows and 39 heifers) and 5 (Elisa positive!) sheep were sent to the NIAH and were tested there against 5 Simbu serogroup viruses by neutralization tests. We regard cow sera as representing a cumulative history of exposure, whereas the potential exposure of heifers took place during the summer/autumn of 2014.

Sera from heifers neutralized AINOV (23/40), AKAV (13/39), Sathuperi virus (SATV) (15/40), or Shamonda virus (SHAV), (4/39), but not Peaton virus (PEAV). 7 of the heifer sera neutralized more than one single virus, whereas 6 sera did not neutralize any, despite being found positive by the commercial SBV ELISA test.

Sera from cows neutralized AINOV, AKAV, SATV, SHAV and PEAV. Up to 4 different specific antibodies were detected in some sera. PEAV antibodies were detected in 2 cows, but not in any heifer, indicating that PEAV had circulated in Israel but not in the 2014 vector season. Sera from the adult sheep neutralized AKAV, SATV, and SHAV (no test for SHUV was performed).

The findings suggest that several Simbu serogroup viruses have circulated in Israel in the past years and that multiple viruses were circulating in Israel simultaneously in the 2014 season. This survey identifies for the 1st time possible activity of SATV, SHAV, and PEAV in Israel.

[The preliminary findings above, indicating the circulation of several Simbu serogroup viruses in Israel, deserve the attention of other Middle East as well as European countries.

Two members of the Simbu serogroup in the genus _Orthobunyavirus_ are known to have caused large-scale outbreaks of arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly [A-H] in domestic ruminants in the Middle East (Akabane virus, since 1969) and Europe (Schmallenberg virus, since 2011). This is indicative of the presence, in these regions, of arthropod vectors which could potentially transmit and disseminate other Simbu serogroup viruses. Teratogenic capacity of the added viruses is suspected but yet to be determined for each of them.

Israel suffered its 1st and by-far largest A-H epizootic in cattle, sheep and goats during 1969/70, affecting thousands of animals, mainly in the northern districts, causing heavy economical losses and suffering. The viral, vector-borne etiology of the syndrome was suspected from its early stages, based upon epidemiological assessment and non-specific immunological findings by the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI), namely high levels of immunoglobulins in the pre-colostral sera of affected calves. However final diagnosis could become feasible only when the enigmatic etiology of ruminant A-H in Japan and Australia was deciphered in 1973.

In 1974, the virological department of the KVI received from Dr Y Inaba, NIAH, Tokyo, Japan, the strain JaGAr 39 of the Akabane virus for neutralization tests. A retrospective examination of the pre-colostral sera from the epizootic, which were kept frozen since the outbreak 4 years earlier, revealed antibodies to the Akabane virus. The diagnosis was supported by the testing of sera collected in 1975 from hundreds of cows which had been affected in 1969/70 as well as from heifers born during later years. All the younger animals, born after the epizootic, were negative to Akabane virus, in contrast to the high percentage of positive sera among the older cows from affected farms. Similar results were obtained in sampled sheep and goats. The said and additional data are available in the reference below.

The continuous cooperation between the KVI (Israel) and NIAH (Japan) has been indispensable, enabling the current findings as well.
