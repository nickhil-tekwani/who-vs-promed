Clerics have given Sudanese Muslims the all-clear to sacrifice
animals infected by a Rift Valley fever [RVF] outbreak in coming
festivities, local media reported on Sunday [18 Nov 2007].

The deadly disease has so far killed 96 people in Sudan and threatens
to devastate the country's huge livestock industry.

Religious scholars have now ruled that animals suspected of having
the disease will still be acceptable sacrifices for the major Muslim
festival of Eid ul-Adha, daily newspaper Akhir Lahzah reported.

The Board of Sudanese Religious Scholars ruled that Muslims were only
banned from sacrificing animals with a disease mentioned in the
Hadith, a collection of the sayings of the Prophet, the paper said.

Sudan's Ministry of Animal Resources has claimed there is no sign of
Rift Valley fever [RVF] among livestock, despite the confirmed human
cases. But the World Health Organisation last week said Sudan had
reported cases of the disease in animals in the country's White Nile
state.

RVF can kill as many as half the people who contract it, and has no
effective human vaccine. It spreads to humans from infected livestock
via contaminated blood or mosquitoes.

Eid ul-Adha, which celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his
son, falls this year on 20 Dec 2007.

[The above is rather difficult to comprehend; if accurate, Sudan's
public health and animal health authorities should find the way to
convince the clerics to warn their followers, in a timely manner,
about the grave consequences of exposure to infected animals,
particularly during slaughter. Public education should be encouraged.

Human exposure to slaughtered animals was regarded as a main factor
contributing to the significant mortality (officially 598 humans,
unofficially mounting to 4 or even 5-digit figures) which was
observed in Egypt during the 1977-78 RVF major epizootic.
