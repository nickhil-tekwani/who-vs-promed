An outbreak of [infection with] the bacterium _Burkholderia cepacia_, at Hospital Dr Luis Felipe Guevara Rojas in El Tigre, Anzoátegui State, Venezuela has sickened 22 infants, according to the College of Physicians in the country (computer translated).

Pediatric infectious disease physician, Irimar Del Moral, suggests the outbreak is linked to water shortages, which has been going on for 6 months. "The water shortages have worsened in the past 30 days. The short supply is then stored and is likely the source of the outbreak", Del Moral notes. To make matters worse, Del Moral says shortages of antibiotics are a major part of the outbreak problem as no antibiotics have been available for 2 days.

In addition, there are reports of another hospital-acquired infection popping up at the hospital -- _Stenotrophomonas maltophilia_.

The bad situation has prompted calls for the resignation of regional health authorities.

_Burkholderia cepacia_ is the name for a group or "complex" of bacteria that can be found in soil and water. _B. cepacia_ bacteria are often resistant to common antibiotics. _B. cepacia_ poses little medical risk to healthy people; however, it is a known cause of infections in hospitalized patients. People with certain health conditions, like weakened immune systems or chronic lung diseases (particularly cystic fibrosis), may be more susceptible to infections with _B. cepacia_.

For the past year, Venezuela has faced chronic shortages of medical supplies, including basic medicine.

[_B. cepacia_ complex is a group of related non-lactose-fermenting, Gram negative bacterial species, some of which are capable of causing life-threatening respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised patients or patients with chronic lung diseases, particularly cystic fibrosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217180).

_B. cepacia_ is a water/soil organism that was formerly classified as _Pseudomonas cepacia_. _B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments and can contaminate certain antiseptic solutions such as quaternary ammonium salts, chlorhexidine, and iodine products. _B. cepacia_ are often resistant to common antibiotics.

In the news report, a physician is said to suggest that the outbreak is linked to "stored" water and "water shortages", but does not elaborate on the type of water involved or how it was stored. Was the "water" contaminated intravenous solutions? Did this outbreak occur in a neonatal ICU? What type of infections did _B. cepacia_ cause, for example, bacteremia or respiratory tract infections? More information about this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.
