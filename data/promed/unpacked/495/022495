Recent outbreaks of illness reported by people who had drunk Coca-Cola
beverages were caused by problems at two plants in Belgium and France, the
Coca-Cola company said Tuesday.
Stores across Belgium removed all Coca-Cola beverages such as Fanta, Sprite
and Minute Maid fruit juices from shelves Tuesday to comply with a
government ban.
Coca-Cola Enterprises Belgium Director-General Philippe Lenfant told a news
conference a bottling plant in Antwerp used the wrong carbon dioxide to add
carbonation in soft drink bottles, and cans of soda from a plant in Dunkirk,
France, were contaminated with a fungicide to treat transportation pallets.
Belgium Health Minister Luc Van Bossche banned all sales of the company's
beverages Monday after nearly 100 people, mostly children, were hospitalized
over the past week suffering from nausea.

Coca-Cola Ban Prompts New Europe Health Alert
----------------------------------------------------
Europe was put on red alert Tuesday as a new health
scare threatened to take one of the world's most popular soft drinks off
the market at the start of the peak summer consumption season.
The Belgian government, which resigned Monday after losing an election
fought largely over another food health scare, ordered Coca-Cola to
withdraw all its products after more than 100 children fell ill.
Luxembourg also banned sales of all Coca-Cola products -- including Minute
Maid, Cherry Coke, Fanta, Sprite and Lift -- while a spokesman for Nestle
in Zurich said supplies of its Nestea drink were hit as Coca-Cola bottles
and distributes these in Belgium.
France withdrew a batch of Coca-Cola drinks bottled at a Dunkirk plant as
scores of Belgian children succumbed to bouts of vomiting, nausea and
dizziness after drinking the company's products.
The European Commission issued a rapid alert notice to all EU countries
notifying them of the potential problem.
Spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the cross border impact was likely to be
limited, but added that France and the Netherlands may need to take some
action. In Germany and Spain, the authorities moved swiftly to allay
consumers' fears by stating they do not import Coca-Cola products from
Belgium.
In early New York trading, Coca-Cola shares dropped by one dollar to $63/13.
The Belgian Health Ministry said a toxicology center had found cases of
haemolysis -- a blood disorder that causes the destruction of red
corpuscles -- among people who had drunk Coca-Cola.
A ministry statement said Coca-Cola products would remain barred in Belgium
until the firm could show the exact cause of the problem and prove it had
taken all necessary measures to prevent new cases of illness.
