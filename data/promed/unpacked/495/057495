In response to the 10 Feb 2014 ProMED-mail posting about the younger age of H1N1 deaths in New York State this season [Influenza (10): USA (NY) H1N1, fatal at younger age 20140210.2267599], we would like to highlight our earlier posting on 1 Jan 2014 (archive number 20140101.2146429) in which we shared results from a May 2013 serosurvey conducted in Canada showing age-related differences in seroprotection [showing that: pre-school children and young or middle-aged adults were currently the most susceptible to A(H1N1)pdm09 infection] that may partially explain the greater disease burden in young and middle-aged adults this season. See http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2146429.

In addition, while estimates of vaccine effectiveness are awaited from other jurisdictions, it may be reassuring to highlight a publication from Canada last week (6 Feb 2014) in Eurosurveillance. In this paper, we report mid-season estimates of vaccine effectiveness from Canada of 74 percent (95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 58-83 percent) against medically-attended laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infection, and conclude that:

"... the 2013/14 TIV [trivalent influenza vaccine] provides substantial protection against resurgent but conserved A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in Canada during the 2013/14 season, reducing the risk of medically-attended laboratory-confirmed A(H1N1)pdm09 illness by about three quarters. Neither antigenic drift nor homologous vaccine failure can account for resurgent A(H1N1)pdm09 activity this season in Canada. Other factors involved in agent-host interaction, including pre-existing antibody, should be considered in explaining the current epidemiology of this virus."

The full paper is available at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20690, and was also reported by CIDRAP at http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/02/canadian-study-finds-flu-vaccine-working-well-against-h1n1.

Recognizing some variation based on study populations and methods, it is anticipated that our mid-season vaccine effectiveness estimates from Canada will be comparable to other countries, such as the United States, that have also experienced predominant circulation of H1N1, antigenically similar to vaccine, this season.

[ProMED-mail appreciates the reminder from Dr Skownronski and Ms Chambers regarding seroprevalence and observed protection against the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain that is currently the dominant influenza strain circulating in North America. It is a good reminder that vaccination remains the most important tool in preventing morbidity and mortality from influenza. US authorities recommend vaccination for all individuals older than 6 months of age. - Mod.LM
