Sublineages of avian influenza detected in Africa
-----------------------------------------------
In Africa, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus was
1st detected in northern Nigeria and later also in other regions of
the country. Since then, 7 other African countries have reported H5N1
infections. Ducatez et al. (reference below) describe a comparison of
full-length genomic sequences of H5N1 isolates from 7 chicken farms
in Nigeria and chicken and hooded vultures in Burkina Faso with
earlier H5N1 outbreaks worldwide. In addition, the antigenicity of
Nigerian H5N1 isolates was compared with earlier strains.
All African strains clustered within 3 sublineages denominated A
(south-west Nigeria, Niger), B (south-west Nigeria, Egypt, Djibouti)
and C (northern Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire), with
distinct nucleotide and amino acid signatures and distinct
geographical distributions within Africa.
Probable non-African ancestors within the west Asian/Russian/European
lineage distinct from the south-east Asian lineages were identified
for each sublineage. All reported human cases in Africa (Egypt and
Djbouti) were caused by sublineage B.
Substitution rates were calculated on the basis of sequences from 11
strains from a single farm in south-west Nigeria. As H5N1 emerged
essentially at the same time in the north and south-west of Nigeria,
the substitution rates confirmed that the virus probably did not
spread from the north to the south, given the observed sequence
diversity, but that it entered the country via 3 independent
introductions. [Analysis of nucleotide substitution rates indicated
that HPAI H5N1 virus has mutated faster within a single Nigerian farm
than occurred during the course of transit of the virus from Qinghai
Lake to Africa. - Mod.CP]
The strains from Burkina Faso seemed to originate from northern
Nigeria. At least 2 of the sublineages also circulated in Europe in
2006 as seen in Germany, further suggesting that the sublineages had
already emerged outside of Africa and seemed to have followed the
east African/west Asian and Black Sea/Mediterranean flyways of migratory birds.

[On top of the author's main conclusion about the virus following the
African/west Asian and Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway of migratory
birds, indicating that the geographical origin of west African HPAI
H5N1 was not south-east Asia but the central Asian/European region,
it is worthwhile to cite the following observations from their
concluding discussion:
1.All five Nigerian virus isolates tested in the haemagglutination
inhibition assay were antigenically most similar to influenza virus
A/turkey/ Turkey/1/2005, a WHO-recommended vaccine strain.
2. Reservations of the developed countries towards vaccination
against H5N1 delay crucial decisions and prevent rapid action in
Africa. Socio-economic and political hurdles further compromise
control measures, whilst the virus continues to spread and threatens
to become endemic.
