Having raised the topic and given a sketch of what is currently happening
in a few of the Pacific countries, we felt we should complete the picture
of dengue activity in the Pacific in 1997.
The current dengue-2 virus activity in the Pacific very likely originates
from a large outbreak in French Polynesia, starting in August 1996 and
continuing until May 1997. There were 6,952 reported clinical cases during
this period. Although the epidemic was officially considered as over in
May 1996, there continue to be sporadic cases in French Polynesia, and
there have also been approximately 200 clinical cases in New Caledonia this
year (92% DEN-2).
The outbreak of DEN-2 in Cook Islands commenced in December 1996, with 1075
reported cases to June 1997 (end of the epidemic).
Western Samoa has reported 81 cases of DEN-2 starting sometime before
August 1997.
All of the above outbreaks were due to closely related strains.
Fiji has reported 6 cases in September 1997 and Tonga has reported a 5
cases in August 1997 (awaiting sequencing, but likely to be related to the
above outbreaks).
An unrelated outbreak of DEN-2 occurred in the Torres Strait (Australia) in
December 1996 (and in Cairns, also Australia) in April 1997).

[Thanks to Tony Stewart for bringing us up-to-date. If 8% of the cases are
not (or perhaps only "may not be") due to DEN-2 virus, what is the virus
(i.e., DEN-1, DEN-3, DEN-4) involved with those cases? It is the
occurrence of sequential infections with dengue viruses that is the most
worrisome. - Mod.CHC
