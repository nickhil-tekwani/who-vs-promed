The AVA [Australian Veterinary Association veterinarians] are warning
horse owners to take precautions against mosquito borne disease, as
veterinarians report a growing number of horses with unusual
neurological signs in New South Wales [NSW], Victoria, and South
Australia. "These cases are still under investigation, however, they
may result from infection with a mosquito borne virus in the
Kunjin-West Nile group," said Dr Christine Smith, president-elect of
the Equine Veterinary Association.

"Clinical signs may include depression and mild colic. These may also
include the onset of neurological signs including increased
responsiveness to touch and sound, facial paralysis, and difficulty
masticating, hypermetria in forelimbs and weakness in hindquarters,
general ataxia, and/or recumbency. Most of the horses involved appear
to be recovering slowly, however there have also been reports of a few
deaths," said Dr Smith.

The NSW Department of Industry and Investment requests bloods samples
(serum and heparin) be submitted to the relevant laboratory, and
follow up blood samples at 7 days and 3 weeks after the onset of
clinical signs. All of the horses tested by the NSW Department of
Industry and Investment so far have been negative for hendravirus,
however veterinarians should follow PPE [personal protective
equipment] protocols when examining sick animals.

There are a range of products available including fly veils and
registered chemical treatments to help protect horses from insect
bites. It is also advisable to try to keep horses inside during dawn
and dusk to help reduce their exposure to mosquitoes. If a horse is
exhibiting these clinical signs the owner should consult a
veterinarian immediately.

[It would be of interest to know how many cases and deaths have
occurred in the states mentioned and over what period of time they
have occurred. These states have experienced unusual rains and
flooding that have increased mosquito breeding sites.

As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment of 17 Apr 2010 (ProMED-mail
archive number 20100417.1251): In the 8th ICTV Report Kunjin virus and
West Nile virus are grouped together (as members of the West Nile
virus species). Both are members of the Japanese encephalitis virus
group of flaviviruses.
