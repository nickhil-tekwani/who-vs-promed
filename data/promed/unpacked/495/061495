Fungal disease ruins nutmeg crop
--------------------------------
Nutmeg farmers of the district, especially those in the Angamaly/Kalady belt, which is a major nutmeg producing region in the state [of Kerala], are in severe crisis due to a massive phytophthora fungal attack drastically ruining their crop. Experts and farmer organisations estimate that there will be at least 35 percent dip in the total yield this time.

Since marginal and small farmers constitute the majority of the nutmeg farming community for whom it is the single source of income, the crop loss can generate an intense economic and social crisis. The impact can adversely affect the farmers and economy for the next 3 to 4 years.

"The rise in humidity because of unprecedented rain is the main factor behind the spread of the fungus. It firstly creates water-soaked lesions in the leaves. These lesions then spread to other parts of the tree. Many trees have been damaged because of the attack," pointed out an agricultural officer.

"The affected leaves should be burned. But because of rain, the farmers could not do it and the infection spread through rain water. The situation is extremely serious. Nutmeg-growing regions are critically affected," he said.

"If not tackled, the crisis will devastate the region," said a farmer involved in organic nutmeg farming.

[Nutmegs are tropical trees in the genus _Myristica_. The economically most important species is _M. fragrans_ originating in the Moluccas, but a number of other species are also important in their respective regions of origin (for example, _M. argentea_ - Papua New Guinea; _M. malabarica - India; _M. yunnanensis_ - China). Commercial nutmeg is the dried kernel of the seed, mace the dried seed covering (aril) surrounding it under the outer skin of the fruit. Both are widely used as spices and for medicinal purposes.

The crop is known to be affected by species of the fungus-like genus _Phytophthora_ (previously classed as a fungus, as in the report above), including _P. ramorum_ (also causing, for example, Sudden Oak Death and other devastating diseases of native trees and shrubs in Europe and the Americas), and _P. palmivora_ (also causing, for example, bud rot disease of palms, black pod of cocoa). In nutmegs, these pathogens may lead to severe defoliation, rotting of new shoots and fruits, shoot necrosis and premature fruit drop, and they can completely destroy whole crops.

The pathogens are spread by insect activity, mechanical means, plant debris, water and wind. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach, including cultural techniques, phytosanitary measures and targeted use of fungicides (for example, copper sprays).
