[Since the start of the LPAI H7N9 human disease in eastern China in early 2013, China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has submitted to the OIE 11 follow-up reports, following the initial, immediate notification of 4 Apr 2013, addressing a total of 25 "outbreaks" (detection of the virus in non-clinical birds and in their environment, particularly live poultry markets). The recent renewed incidence of the disease in humans has been reflected in virus detection in the poultry environment. Since the start of 2014, the virus has been reported from 3 provinces: In follow-up report No. 10 of 16 Jan 2014 (Zhejiang; see http://tinyurl.com/p4led5q) and in the current follow-up report No. 11, dated 26 Jan 2014, in Guangdong and Fujian (see map at the source URL).

Notably, an official press release of China's MOA, dated 27 Jan 2014, reports that H7N9 has been recorded since the start of 2014 in 4 provinces, namely in Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian and Guangxi. It may be assumed that the testing of the sample from Guangxi was completed after the submission of the recent follow-up report to the OIE. This westward spread of H7N9 into Guangxi, a province neighbouring Viet Nam, is of concern; information on the geographical origin and other details of the positive sample are requested. For China's administrative map, see http://www.chinatoday.com/china-map/china-map-atlas.htm.

The Chinese MOA report (in Chinese) is available at http://www.moa.gov.cn/zwllm/zwdt/201401/t20140127_3750290.htm. - Mod.AS
