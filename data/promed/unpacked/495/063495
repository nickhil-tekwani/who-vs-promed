Washington, DC, 14 July 1997-- The Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) "is working closely with the authorities of Sao Paulo in order
to cope with the resurgence of measles in that Brazilian city, "
according to Dr. Ciro A. de Quadros, Director of the Special Program
for Vaccines and Immunization of PAHO.

Since the start of 1997, 846 suspected cases of measles have been
reported to the Ministry of Health of Sao Paulo. Of these, 383
(45.3%) were confirmed as measles by laboratory, 127 (15%) were ruled
out after analyses, and 336 (39.7%) continue under study. To date,
five measles deaths have been reported; all have occurred in infants
less than one year of age.

Since 1990, year of the last major outbreak of measles in Sao
Paulo, relatively few cases had been reported, and only 22 cases were
confirmed in 1996. This year, 932 cases of measles have been
confirmed in the entire Western Hemisphere.

PAHO, which succeeded in eradicating polio from the Americas in
1991, began a campaign to eliminate measles from the Americas by the
year 2000. The Organization recommends quadrennial follow-up
vaccination for children from 1 to 4 years old when the number of
susceptible preschool children reaches a certain level. But,
according to a new issue of the Expanded Program on Immunization
Bulletin released today, A follow-up vaccination campaign for
children 9 months to 4 years of age should have taken place in Sao
Paulo, but did not.

The EPI Bulletin notes that since March 1997, suspected measles cases
have increased considerably, reaching around 400 in May. The
metropolitan area of Sao Paulo is the most affected by this outbreak.
The highest incidence corresponds to the city of Sao Paulo. In the
rest of the state few cases have been reported.

In the Adolfo Lutz Institute, measles virus was isolated from
clinical samples obtained in several cases. The genetic analysis of
these virus isolates is being carried out in the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's measles laboratories in Atlanta,
demonstrating the quick reaction of the Sao Paulo authorities. This
information could offer important clues to the source of the virus
that caused the outbreak in Sao Paulo.

The confirmed cases range from people 2 months to 44 years old,
with more than half occurring in people between 20 and 29 years of
age. The group with the highest attack index is that of children under
one, followed by adults from 20 to 29 and children from 1 to 4 years
old . The infants and the young adults who have not been vaccinated
seem to be those at highest risk to contract measles.

Several cases of measles have been confirmed in young adults who
work in health services, and measles transmission has been documented
from patients to health workers and vice versa.

After an examination of the available data, an advisory panel
created by the Ministry of Health recommended a special vaccination
campaign against measles to cut the outbreak. The campaign, directed
at children of six months to 4 years, began June 21, 1997.
