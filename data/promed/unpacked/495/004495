Bull dies from anthrax in Goulburn Valley
-----------------------------------------
A bull has died from anthrax on a property at Stanhope, in Victoria's
Goulburn Valley. The Department of Primary Industries says the animal was
from a farm that was affected by last February's [2007] anthrax outbreak,
when 37 cattle died.

The property has been isolated and cattle on neighbouring properties were
vaccinated at the weekend.

re: Anthrax, bovine - Australia (Victoria)
------------------------------------------
Thank you for your enquiry. As you know I am always keen to ensure
ProMED-mail receives good information on cases of anthrax, given the
interest these generate.

In Victoria, herds are required by the Department (that is, by law) to be
revaccinated annually for 3 years following a case of anthrax, and we check
for compliance. This recent simple and uncomplicated case occurred in a
herd that was re-vaccinated as recently as November 2007, having had a case
last summer (January/February 2007). At that time all neighbouring herds
were also vaccinated. Why this animal succumbed is a question we are
endeavouring to answer. We are checking through vaccination records to
determine whether the animal (a dairy bull) was missed, or whether this was
a vaccination "failure". Either way, we are not expecting further cases in
this herd.

The farm is in an area where anthrax occurs sporadically, where there is
good compliance by farmers with reporting -- or seeking veterinary
attention for -- sudden deaths. We also have surveillance at the local
knackery (rendering works). These measures and our rapid response to them,
ensure that these sporadic cases have no implications for animal or public
health when they occur.

I am happy for this reply to be posted if you wish.

[Many thanks to Hugh Millar for his clear and prompt comments.

The experience described highlights something that has always confused me.
If you have an effective vaccination and control programme, why do some
herds continue to come down, albeit sporadically? Perhaps some can be
explained by human procrastination over repetitive vaccination, but when
you look at actual histories, events such as this bull appear. The fate of
this bull seems analogous to that of a "canary" in a coal mine
[<http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/30/newsid_2547000/2547587.stm>],
illustrating continuing risk in the area and promoting the continuation of
control programmes continue until the risk is past. But the question
remains, why do animals come down with anthrax when an otherwise effective
vaccination and control protocol is in place?

I don't have an answer. Possibly it is because individual animals do not
respond adequately to the vaccine and chance has them being exposed.
Elsewhere the vaccine has sometimes come under question but to date we have
not found one that had been working well to suddenly fail. I look forward
to hearing what Hugh and his people discover to explain this dead bull.
Maybe the 3-year rule will have to be revisited.
