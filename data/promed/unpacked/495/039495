EUROPEAN PLANT PROTECTION ORGANIZATION: NEW SERVER
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Anne-Sophie Roy [Roy@eppo.fr]

[Please remind your subscribers that they may register] to the new EPPO
electronic
documentation service (eppo_docs@eppo.fr) which replaces the previous
mail-server (mail-server@eppo.fr). I hope that [they] find it easy to use.
It is now possible to obtain directly the EPPO Reporting Service files.
I visited the ProMED-plant web site
<http://www.agnic.org/pmp/1996/eed9606.html> and noted that one page
referred in fact to the old EPPO mail-server which does not function any
more. As it is a good idea to have a reference to the EPPO electronic
documentation service, would it be possible to update this web page and
make a reference to the new service. I have summarized below the
instructions for the users, in case you may wish to use them.
New EPPO Electronic Documentation Service.
The EPPO Electronic Documentation Service is a mail system (not a Web site)
with which you can obtain EPPO files, by sending very simple e-mail
messages at the following address: <eppo_docs@eppo.fr>
How to access the EPPO Electronic Documentation Service.
1. Register as a user.
EPPO files have been separated into five directories according to the topic
concerned:
PPPstandards (EPPO standards on plant protection products)
PQstandards (EPPO standards on plant quarantine)
Regulations (EPPO summaries of phytosanitary regulations and original texts)
Reporting (EPPO Reporting Service)
Publications (various EPPO publications, e.g. data sheets)
To receive the EPPO files, you have first to register as a user of the
directory(ies) you are interested in (as many as you want), by sending the
following e-mail message to <eppo_docs@eppo.fr>: Join (name of the
directory you want)
Example : Join Reporting
You will receive in return two messages. One is a transaction report which
tells you that you successfully joined the chosen directory and the second
gives full explanation on how to obtain the contents of the directory, and
then the files.
2. Obtain the contents.
Send the following e-mail message to <eppo_docs@eppo.fr>: Dir (name of the
directory you want)
Example : Dir Reporting
You will again receive in return two messages. One is a transaction report
which tells you that the command was completed and the second will be
entitled (for example) "directory for the list Reporting", and will list
all the file names.
3. Get the files
Send the following e-mail message to <eppo_docs@eppo.fr>: Get (name of the
directory name of the file).
Example : Get Reporting rse-9701.doc
You will again receive in return two messages. One is a transaction report
which tells you that the command was completed and the second will contain
the requested file as an attachment.
You can obtain several files with a single request.
Example : Get Reporting rse-9701.doc
Get Reporting rse-9702.doc
