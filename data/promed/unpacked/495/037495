A further 5 cases of African swine fever (ASF) are suspected in wild boar in the German state of Brandenburg, close to the border with Poland.

This follows the discovery of ASF for the 1st time in Germany in a dead wild boar in a field of harvested crops in the state last week [week of 7 Sep 2020].

The 5 news cases were found in dead wild boar close to the 1st case, Brandenburg state health minister Ursula Nonnemacher told a committee of the state's parliament, Reuters reports. Initial tests were positive and tests are underway to confirm the additional cases at Germany's Friedrich-Loeffler scientific institute, she told the meeting.

On its website, the Brandenburg Government said measures to combat ASF were 'consistently implemented in the state of Brandenburg'.

"After all farmers and hunters have been informed of the situation and the core zone with a radius of at least 3 kilometers [about 1.9 mi, restriction zone] from where the infected wild boar carcass was found was completely fenced off with an electric fence on Saturday [12 Sep 2020], the search for further dead wild boars is being carried out in a targeted manner. Outside of this, the hunting of wild boar is significantly intensified," it said today [15 Sep 2020].

A 2nd zone, the 'endangered area' has been set up with a 15 km [about 9 mi] radius, with a further 30 km [about 19 mi] buffer zone around it.

Specific measures in the endangered area to reduce further spread include:
1. A hunting ban for all animal species in order to prevent unnecessarily startling potentially infected wild boar.
2. An intensive game search by trained staff and with the participation of local hunters.
3. Rescue and safe disposal of all wild boar carcasses under hygienic conditions, with collection points for fallen game and accident game set up on site.
4. A review of pig farms with regard to compliance with biosecurity measures.
5. Examination of provisional usage restrictions for agricultural and forestry areas (harvest ban for maize fields).
6. Prohibition of events with pigs.
7. Identification of hunters who are also pig farmers.
8. Information and training for hunters.

The discovery of ASF in Germany and subsequent loss of the country's ASF-free status has resulted in a number of countries, including China, imposing import bans on German pork, with knock-on effects on the wider market.

African swine fever (ASF) is apparently spreading further in Germany. After the 1st nationwide case in Brandenburg became known last week [week of 7 Sep 2020], other animals are now likely to be affected. ASF infection is usually rapid and severe. Some virus strains kill 100 percent of the infected animals.

The carcass of a wild boar was found in Brandenburg last week. A test for the pathogen was positive. It was the 1st evidence of the disease in Germany. To prevent the disease from spreading any further, a 12-kilometer mobile electric fence was built around the site at the weekend.

The carcasses of the animals currently affected were been discovered very close to where the 1st case of swine fever was found in Germany, said Brandenburg Health Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) on Tuesday [15 Sep 2020] in front of members of the Brandenburg State Parliament. 4 wild boars were found dead and one animal was killed. The 1st tests were positive, the last security should now be an examination of the animals by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut.

The virus is not only fatal for wild boars, but domestic pigs can also be affected. Several countries, including China, the largest importer of German pork outside the EU, have already imposed import bans on pork from Germany because of the 1st known evidence.

Because of ASF, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, and Argentina have also banned German pork imports. The Federal Ministry of Agriculture is in talks with the governments of these countries to reach agreements, the ministry said. The aim is to limit import bans due to ASF only to companies from affected German regions -- and not to introduce them to all of Germany. This is also the case in the EU, to which around 70 percent of pork exports go.

In fact, an export stop affects most destination countries outside the EU. The background to this is that export certificates can no longer state that Germany is "swine fever-free", as the ministry explained.

The farmers in Brandenburg are concerned with the question of how things will go on for them and their farms. In the 3 districts, which are up to 15 miles [about 24 km] away from the sites, restrictions were issued. This means that animal traffic is restricted in Oder-Spree, Dahme-Spreewald, and Spree-Neisse. Fields and forests may not be entered.

The causative agent of swine fever is a DNA virus, such as herpes, papilloma, and smallpox viruses. Unlike these relatives, it is not dangerous for humans [but lapses in biosecurity measures favor the spread of the disease]: ASF is not a zoonosis. Even those who eat meat from infected animals cannot get sick from it

The viruses are extremely resistant, however, they can survive for years and remain contagious -- in frozen meat even for up to 1000 days. The stability and the easy transferability via food, blood in small amounts or animal carcasses make containment so difficult -- every sausage sandwich that travelers throw away at a rest area at the edge of the forest can infect a wild boar, every tire track on a truck can spread the disease: the virus can stick to vehicles, clothing, or shoes.

In wild boars, the disease is similar to that in domestic pigs. The animals are feverish and weak, have diarrhea, and shortness of breath. In Africa, the virus is found in warthogs and is transmitted to domestic pigs via soft ticks.

In Europe, the disease first appeared in Sardinia in 1978 but was able to be localized there despite repeated outbreaks. Introduced into Georgia via contaminated food, the ASF virus then began to spread in Europe in 2007. From Poland, it has now reached Brandenburg.

[The counting of the German ASF clock began when, on 4 Nov 2019, an ASF-infected wild boar was identified in the Lubuskie voivodship, western Poland. This meant that the virus had hopped westward by 300 km (186 mi) from its previous, westernmost infected area in Poland, around the capital Warsaw. Experts agreed that such leap was, most probably, due to human negligence. The location, 85 km (53 mi) distant from the German border, was followed by additional cases found in this Polish region and advancing westwards. A total of 1134 infected wild boar found dead were reported as of 10 Sep 2020 (OIE interactive map and links to all follow-up reports can be seen at https://tinyurl.com/y6dvlctx). As can be seen on the map (zoom in), 5 domestic pig farms have been affected as well.

The finding of additional cases in Germany's wild boar is all but surprising; a similar scenario was seen in other countries in Europe and elsewhere, demonstrating that the chance to discover a real index case, remaining solitary, is negligible. The virus may have entered some time back. If luck prevailed, it remained restricted to the border area; this is yet to be demonstrated. The German authorities seem to have been well-prepared for the anticipated event and will be able to prevent its spread into commercial farms of domestic swine. In February 2018, the German government issued a decree to allow hunters to shoot wild boar year-round to stop the animals, "which can carry ASF, from passing the deadly infection on to farm pigs." This policy is still maintained; hunters in the endangered regions will be obliged to adhere to the prescribed severe biosecurity requirements. - Mod.AS
