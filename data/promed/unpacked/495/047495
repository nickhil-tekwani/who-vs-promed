CWD again crosses Divide - Deer near Hayden latest West Slope case
----------------------------
Colorado Division of Wildlife officials confirmed Friday another deer on the
Western Slope has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD).
The buck was killed in a collision with a vehicle and found by a Division of
Wildlife officer 4 Oct 2002 about 4 miles east of Hayden, according to Jeff
Ver Steeg, the division's chief of terrestrial animals. That's within about
10 miles of an elk ranch that previously had an animal test positive for
CWD, according to John Ellenberger, the agency's big game manager.
Ellenberger said he was informed of the most recent positive result
Thursday, 2 days before the start of the rifle hunting season.
Several wild mule deer infected with the disease were found in the same
general area in April 2002, when wildlife managers culled herds to try and
gauge how far the disease had spread from the elk ranch. The first wild elk
on the West Slope to test positive for CWD was also found in the same
general vicinity, about 20 miles north, in early September 2002.
Additionally, a mule deer with the disease was found south of Glenwood
Springs, and another elk, shot in northern Summit County on 14 Sep 2002, was
infected with CWD.
Given the potential economic impacts on the hunting economy of many West
Slope communities, each new positive test intensifies concerns about how
widely the fatal neurological malady has spread through populations of deer
and elk in western Colorado.
But Ver Steeg and Ellenberger said the result won't trigger any immediate
management action, such as culling herds. For now, wildlife managers are
adopting a wait-and-see approach, hoping widespread testing of animals
killed during hunting season will give them better information on the spread
of the disease.
"We take each one of these positive results and evaluate them on an
individual basis," Ver Steeg said. "If additional positives do come in, we
want to see the distribution," Ellenberger said. "Is it going to be
clustered in the southwestern corner of Routt County or is it random? We're
really trying to get hunters to help us so we can figure out the
distribution and prevalence."
