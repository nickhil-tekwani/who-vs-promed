[Greece has notified 7 outbreaks of sheep pox and doat pox (SGP) in the region of Macedonia and Thrace since the 2nd half of August 2013, when the disease was detected http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13928.

The outbreaks are located in the Evros region of Greece (see the map at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps), which is located less than 2 km from the Evros River that forms the border with Turkey, and 60 km from the border with Bulgaria, where the disease has been reported recently (see archive number 20130924.1964207).

According to the WAHID summary, the total number of animals affected in the 7 outbreaks is:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 89 / 0 / 0 / 89 / 0
Sheep / 1026 / 175 / 4 / 1111 / 0
This gives a total of 1115 susceptible, 175 cases, 4 dead, and 1111 destroyed. The cases were limited to sheep.

The above and additional data on this event can also be found at the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary. (Note: to view the information on SGP, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).

While SPGP has not been reported in Greece since January 2007, the disease is widespread and endemic in neighbouring Turkey, not only in the Asian side of the country but also in the European region, indicating regular movements of infected animals or other contaminated vehicles, items, or products. Therefore, these outbreaks in Greece are not a surprise, as the movement of wild or feral ruminants is also likely to occur and is difficult to control http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/files/poa-sheep-pox-greece-130819.pdf.

Control measures in accordance with EC directive 92/119/EEC are being applied http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/files/poa-sheep-pox-greece-130819.pdf. - Mod.CRD
