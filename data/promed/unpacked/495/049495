Acute allergic-type reactions among patients undergoing hemodialysis
-- multiple states, 2007-2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is investigating
an outbreak of acute allergic-type reactions among patients who have
undergone hemodialysis since 19 Nov 2007. The majority of reactions
have occurred among adult hemodialysis patients, with onset within
minutes of initiating a hemodialysis session. Although the cause of
the outbreak is unknown and remains under investigation, the majority
of reactions occurred in patients who received intravenous heparin
produced by Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Deerfield, Illinois).
Baxter voluntarily recalled 9 lots of heparin multidose vials after
learning of these adverse events among patients who received heparin
during dialysis. This report describes the ongoing investigation.

CDC was first notified on 7 Jan 2008, by the Missouri Department of
Health and Senior Services (MDHSS) of allergic-type reactions among
pediatric hemodialysis patients that occurred beginning 19 Nov 2007,
at a pediatric hospital. The reactions had been reported to MDHSS by
a health-care provider at the hospital. The symptoms occurred within
minutes of dialysis initiation and included facial swelling,
tachycardia, hypotension, urticaria, and nausea. A total of 8
episodes of acute allergic-type reactions have been identified as
occurring among 4 patients at the pediatric hospital during 19 Nov
2007-15 Jan 2008. These reactions were reviewed by a clinical
allergist and were determined to be consistent with anaphylactic or
anaphylactoid reaction.

Upon learning of the initial cluster, CDC solicited reports of
similar allergic-type reactions among hemodialysis patients
nationally through nephrology e-mail lists and public health
notifications. In response to these case-finding measures, CDC was
contacted on 9 Jan 2008, by a dialysis supply company that had
received reports during the previous 2-week period of approximately
50 similar reactions among adult hemodialysis patients at dialysis
facilities in 6 states. A 2nd supply company reported learning of
similar reactions from dialysis facilities as early as 10 Dec 2007.
CDC alerted the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] to these
nationwide reports of allergic-type reactions on 9 Jan 2008, and has
been collaborating with FDA on the investigation.

As part of the investigation, CDC has created a working case
definition for these reactions. A confirmed case of acute
allergic-type reaction has been defined as an episode of anaphylactic
or anaphylactoid reaction characterized by angioedema (particularly
swelling of lips/mouth, tongue, throat, or eyelids) or urticaria. A
probable case has been defined as an episode that includes at least 2
of the following signs and symptoms: 1) generalized or localized
sensations of warmth; 2) numbness or tingling of the extremities; 3)
difficulty swallowing; 4) shortness of breath, audible wheezing, or
chest tightness; 5) low blood pressure/tachycardia; or 6) nausea or
vomiting.

Of the episodes reported as of 30 Jan 2008 CDC has identified 65
confirmed or probable cases among 53 hemodialysis patients that
occurred during 19 Nov 2007-21 Jan 2008, at 19 dialysis facilities in
12 states. CDC currently is investigating an additional 36 possible
cases. Most reactions resolved after interruption of the dialysis
session or treatment with diphenhydramine or steroids at the
facility. Other than the 8 episodes reported by MDHSS, all cases have
occurred among adults.

One common factor among the cases being investigated was receipt of
heparin (1000 units/mL) from 30 mL or 10 mL vials manufactured by
Baxter. Intravenous heparin is administered during most hemodialysis
sessions to prevent clotting of the access and dialysis circuit. In
61 (94 percent) of the 65 cases, the affected patient received Baxter
heparin during hemodialysis. Dialyzers from 4 different companies
were being used when the reactions occurred. The most commonly used
dialyzers, manufactured by Fresenius Medical Care (Waltham,
Massachusetts), were being used in 26 (40 percent) of the episodes.
Other exposures have not been ruled out as potential causes of the
reactions, and CDC is conducting additional epidemiologic studies to
examine those exposures.

On 17 Jan 2008, Baxter announced a voluntary recall of 9 lots of
heparin, based on reports the company had received (1). All 9 lots
were produced at a single plant; 8 of the 9 lots were produced during
September-November 2007. Despite the 17 Jan 2008 recall, an
additional reaction occurred on 21 Jan 2008, after a hemodialysis
patient was administered Baxter heparin from one of the recalled
lots. CDC has found indications of delays in removing the recalled
lots of heparin from distribution, which might result in continued
exposures. In addition, these reactions might not be limited to
hemodialysis settings. A cardiac-care facility has reported 7
allergic-type reactions among cardiac patients who received heparin
from lots that were later recalled. CDC and state health departments
are investigating these reactions.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The temporal and geographic distribution of these reactions in a
discrete population of patients suggests common exposure to a
health-care product with wide distribution in the USA. Previous
clusters of acute allergic-type reactions among hemodialysis patients
have been attributed to certain types of dialyzer membranes, ethylene
oxide (used by the manufacturer as a sterilant),
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the reuse of dialyzers
(2,3). However, based on preliminary findings, these previously
recognized causes of allergic-type reactions in dialysis patients are
unlikely to explain this outbreak. Heparin is a biologic product
rarely associated with anaphylactic reactions (4).

CDC is conducting additional case-finding activities and
epidemiologic studies to define the scope of the outbreak and is
exploring options for laboratory testing to further characterize
these reactions. Health-care providers should 1) immediately
discontinue use of and segregate the recalled lots of heparin, 2)
report medication reactions to MedWatch, the online FDA reporting
system for adverse medication events, and 3) report to their state or
local health departments any acute allergic-type reactions that have
occurred since November 2007 in patients receiving hemodialysis or
intravenous medication infusion. Health departments are asked to
report reactions to CDC by telephone (404-639-4514 or 404-639-4273)
or e-mail (<dblossom@cdc.gov> or <ppatel@cdc.gov>).
