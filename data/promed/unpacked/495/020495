Toxigenic _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ infection in a veterinary
student in London, UK, May 2010
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Taylor J, Saavedra-Campos M, Harwood D, et al.]

Introduction
----------
Diphtheria can result in an acute infection of the upper respiratory
tract or a cutaneous lesion. It is caused by three toxin-producing
_Corynebacterium_ species: _C. diphtheriae_ responsible for epidemic
disease, _C. ulcerans_ and, more rarely, _C. pseudotuberculosis_, the
last 2 being zoonotic infectious agents (1,2).

In the United Kingdom (UK) between 2000 and 2009, 43 isolates of
toxigenic corynebacteria were identified in England and Wales, 27 of
which were _C. ulcerans_. 3 unvaccinated individuals presented with
clinical symptoms typical of classic diphtheria, but most had milder
respiratory infections (sore throat or tonsillitis) and had been
either partially or fully immunised (3,4).

Cattle are a documented reservoir for _C. ulcerans_ and risk factors
for human infection with this species include contact with these and
other farm animals (5). Less commonly, _C. ulcerans_ can also be
spread through consumption of unpasteurised milk and unpasteurised
milk products (6). More recently, contact with dogs and other
companion animals has also been proposed as a source of infection
(7-9). Despite limited evidence of person-to-person spread of _C.
ulcerans_, this is a potential route of transmission (6,10). It is
therefore recommended that the public health response following
isolation of toxigenic _C. ulcerans_ from a human case be the same as
that for toxigenic _C. diphtheriae_ (6).

A primary course of diphtheria-containing vaccine is included in the
UK's vaccination schedule and is given at the ages of 2, 3, and 4
months, plus a pre-school booster between the ages of 3 years 4
months and 5 years. This is followed by a booster between the ages of
13 and 18 years (11).


Case report
-----------
A 20-year-old veterinary student in London, United Kingdom, with no
significant medical history, experienced 4 to 5 weeks of recurrent
sore throat and tonsillitis unresponsive to a full course of
penicillin towards the end of March 2010. As symptoms remained, the
case was reviewed by the family doctor and a throat swab was taken
from white tonsillar lesions on 10 May 2010.

The local Health Protection Unit (HPU) was notified by a hospital
microbiology registrar on 17 May 2010 that the throat swab had grown
_C. ulcerans_. A 2nd throat swab, taken on 18 May 2010, when the case
was still symptomatic was then sent to the Streptococcus and
Diphtheria Reference Unit for primary culture and toxigenicity
testing. The case was clinically assessed by the family doctor and,
in consultation with the HPU and microbiology registrar, a course of
erythromycin was started on 18 May 2010. The sample was confirmed as
toxigenic on 21 May 2010.

The case had received a full recommended UK course of immunisation
with diphtheria toxoid, plus a booster at 14 years. The family doctor
was advised by the HPU to offer a convalescent diphtheria booster
vaccination as part of the routine management of the case.

In-depth discussions with the case confirmed that there was no
exposure to unpasteurised milk and no recent overseas travel. As part
of a veterinary medicine undergraduate course, the case had been in
recent contact with animals on 2 separate farming placements. The
date of symptom onset was determined to be during a lambing placement
at a farm in the last 2 weeks of March 2010.

Risk assessment of human contacts
---------------------------------
All close contacts were followed up as indicated by national
guidelines (6). The risk assessment identified 4 household contacts
sharing college accommodation, 2 close contacts, and a partner. One
household contact had mild symptoms (sore throat). 4 of these 7
contacts had records of a full course of immunisation for diphtheria,
while the others had no record of past immunisations against
diphtheria (including the contact with mild symptoms).

Three family members were also identified as contacts, as the case
had stayed with a family during the farm placements. One family
member had developed a sore throat after the case's onset of
symptoms. A complete immunisation record was found for 2 of these
family contacts, including the one who developed a sore throat.

Throat swabs were taken from all of these contacts, who were also
provided with prophylaxis and advised on signs and symptoms of the
infection by their family doctor. Family doctors were advised by the
HPU to offer a booster vaccination if none had been received in the
previous 12 months. All swabs were found to be negative for _C. ulcerans_.

One further asymptomatic contact who accompanied the case during the
lambing placement (and was therefore subject to the same potential
exposure) was also identified. As all samples of contacts had been
negative for _C. ulcerans_, a throat swab was taken, but no
prophylaxis or vaccination given. This throat swab was also negative.

Risk assessment of animal contacts
----------------------------------
A detailed risk assessment of the 2 farming placements was undertaken
by the local HPU, in close collaboration with the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, to determine if a likely source of infection
could be identified and if there was any ongoing risk to the public
or farm owners and workers.

The 2nd placement commenced after symptom onset and was therefore
disregarded as a possible source of infection. The 1st was a lambing
placement on a farm with 800 sheep. However, enquiries to the farm's
veterinarian established that the usual standard of animal health and
hygiene on the farm was high, there were no reported health problems
in the sheep flock during lambing and there were no dogs (working or
pets) on the farm. The farm owners and workers were all reported to
be fit and well and their contact with the sheep and lambs was
determined to be minimal outside lambing season, which had ended some
weeks before the case was notified to the HPU. Moreover, this farm is
not open to the public. Consequently, the ongoing risk to human
health was assessed to be very low and no further investigations were
deemed necessary.

The case had been in close contact with a number of domestic animals
(dogs, cat, rabbit, and chickens) during the same period as the
lambing placement. However, none of these were reported to have
exhibited any clinical signs suggestive of _C. ulcerans_ infection
and, in view of the time lapse and large number of potential
exposures, it was not feasible to undertake any animal sampling (7).

Discussion
----------
Infection with a toxigenic strain of _C. diphtheriae_ or _C.
ulcerans_ can cause serious illness in unvaccinated individuals: 5
deaths from diphtheria have been recorded in the UK since 1986, 3 of
them due to _C. ulcerans_ infection (10). The number of clinical
cases is small and there have been no previous toxigenic
corynebacterial isolates from veterinarians. There is no booster
vaccination for the general adult population, and the severity of the
infection can be especially serious in elderly people in contact with
pets (12,13).

While the source of infection for this case was not proven, the
lambing farm or domestic animals were considered the most likely
sources. Domesticated animals have been implicated as potential
reservoirs of _C. ulcerans_ and the organism is a recognised
commensal in several animal species, usually without overt clinical
signs, although it has been associated with nasal discharge in cats
(5-8). Furthermore, the antibiotics licensed to eliminate the
pathogen in humans are often not licensed for animals. As discussed
previously by other authors, a number of difficult issues arise in
attempting to eliminate subclinical zoonotic infections from healthy
animals for perceived public health reasons (7). It may be more
appropriate to ensure that occupationally exposed groups, such as
veterinary students, are appropriately immunised.

The case presented here had been fully immunised against diphtheria.
This probably explains the relatively mild presentation of symptoms,
as the vaccine provides protection against the effects of toxin
produced by the bacteria. Most UK laboratories will only screen for
corynebacteria if there is a clinical indication of diphtheria and/or
contact with a known case, which suggests that other mild diphtheria
cases may be missed. Indeed, the delay in initial diagnosis of this
case was due to the low level of clinical suspicion.

Conclusions
-----------
Toxigenic _C. ulcerans_ infection remains rare, but it can be fatal,
especially among those who are not immunised. As animal sources can
be difficult to identify and control, maintenance of high vaccination
coverage among the child and adult populations is essential.

[Toxigenic _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ may cause a zoonotic infection
similar to diphtheria caused _C. diphtheriae_
(<http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp>). _C.
ulcerans_ infection in humans has been associated with antecedent
contact with farm animals or with consumption of unpasteurized dairy
products. Livestock, including dairy cattle and pigs
(<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/8/1314.htm>), as well as pet dogs
and cats, can be carriers of _C. ulcerans_ (cats often show bilateral
nasal discharge). _C. ulcerans_ infection in humans can be severe,
especially in inadequately immunized individuals. Although cases of
diphtheria caused by _C. ulcerans_ have been reported previously, the
case reported in the Eurosurveillance article above is as a reminder
that _C. diphtheriae_ is not the only _Corynebacterium_ sp. to cause
diphtheria. A discussion of diphtheria can be found in ProMED-mail
