Concerns have been raised over the schistosomiasis outbreak in Baybay City [Leyte province], an area not known to be endemic for this chronic parasitic disease.

Roderick Boyd Cerro, Department of Health (DOH) regional chief of epidemiology and surveillance unit, said the outbreak in 3 villages in Baybay City caught them by surprise since Baybay has no single case of snail fever in the past decade. "The city health office said Baybay is not known to be an endemic area for schistosomiasis, and they could not recall any reported cases in the last 10 years in the city," Cerro said in an interview [Mon 17 Dec 2018]. Cerro attributed the outbreak to the frequent travel of people from the city's farming villages to other endemic areas in Leyte.

Transmission occurs when people suffering from schistosomiasis contaminate freshwater sources with their feces containing parasite eggs, which hatch in the water. Victims experience headache, weakness, abdominal pain, fever, cough, diarrhea, itchy rash, and bloody stools. Several of them were confined at the schistosomiasis hospital in Palo, Leyte.

Since November until early December [2018], at least 57 cases have been reported in Villa Solidaridad, Mailhi, and Monteverde villages in Baybay, with an attack rate of 22%.

Schistosomiasis is endemic in 25 areas in Leyte province. These are Abuyog, Alangalang, Babatngon, Barugo, Burauen, Carigara, Dagami, Dulag, Jaro, Javier, Julita, La Paz, Macarthur, Mayorga, Matag-ob, Palo, Pastrana, San Miguel, Sta. Fe, Tabontabon, Tacloban City, Tanauan, Tolosa, Tunga, and Villaba.

In the national listings, 4 of the [Eastern Visayas] region's 6 provinces --Leyte, Northern Samar, Samar, Eastern Samar -- are categorized as high endemic areas.

Of the 878 777 exposed populations, 338 842 are in Leyte; 113 175 in Samar; 206 043 in Eastern Samar; and 220 717 in Northern Samar.

The health department has no available data on the number of persons infected with schistosomiasis, but they claimed there have been deaths due to the disease every year. The 1st epidemic of schistosomiasis in the region occurred among Americans and allied forces after landing in Leyte during World War II in 1944. The disease is also known as snail fever as people become infected when larval forms of the parasite released by freshwater snails penetrate the skin during contact with infested water.

"For the past 30 years, human mass drug administration (MDA), utilizing the drug praziquantel, has been the mainstay of control in the country. Recent studies have shown that the schistosomiasis prevalence ranges from 1% to 50% within different endemic zones. There is now strong evidence that large mammals (such as, water buffaloes, cattle) contribute significantly to disease transmission, complicating control efforts. Given the zoonotic nature of schistosomiasis in the Philippines, it is evident that the incidence, prevalence, and morbidity of the disease will not be controlled by MDA alone. There is a need for innovative cost-effective strategies to control schistosomiasis in the long term." - Mod.EP
