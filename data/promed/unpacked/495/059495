First Report of _Phytophthora capsici_ on Cucumber and Melon in Southeastern
Spain.

Centre, N-1432, Ås, Norway; R. Blanco, M. Santos, and J. C. Tello,

Plant Dis. 86:558, 2002; published on-line as D-2002-0222-01N, 2002.
Accepted for publication 24 Jan 2002.
During the growing seasons of 1999 to 2001, cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L.)
expressing symptoms of ] crown and root rot [and] ... wilting ... were
observed in greenhouses in southeastern Spain (Granada). ... Root and crown
... symptoms were observed also on melon (_Cucumis melo_ L.) in greenhouses
in another area of southeastern Spain (Almeria) in 2001.
Isolates from diseased plants from both locations were identified as
_Phytophthora capsici_ (Leonian). Isolates produced papillate sporangia of
variable shape, some of them with 2 or 3 papilla. Sporangia were caducous
with pedicels of variable lengths that could be longer than the sporangia.
In all, 3 isolates were crossed with _P. capsici_ strains of known mating
type. All isolates produced amphigynous antheridia and were mating type A1.
Isolates grew well at 35 degrees C and did not produce chlamydospores.
Pathogenicity was examined for one isolate [each] from cucumber and ...
melon. Cucumber and melon plants at the 4-leaf stage and pumpkin (_Cucurbita
maxima_ × _C. moschata_) plants at the 5-leaf stage were inoculated with a
myceli[al] suspension. Both isolates caused wilting and death of plants on
the 3 host species tested. The pathogen was reisolated from roots and stems
of diseased plants.
To our knowledge, this is the first time _P. capsici_ has been found on
cucumber and [greenhouse] melon in Spain ... It has [also] been found ... to
cause root and crown rot of melon in southeastern Spain. Previously, [it]
... [had] been reported to cause disease of field-grown melon (2) and
greenhouse-grown pepper (_Capsicum annum_) (1) in eastern and southeastern
Spain, respectively.
