A Belgian man died from a drug-resistant so-called superbug
originating in South Asia, a doctor said Friday [13 Aug 2010], the
1st reported death from the new health threat.

A 2nd Belgian was infected after being hospitalized after an accident
during a trip to his native Montenegro, but recovered following
treatment in Belgium, another expert said.

The 1st victim was infected while being treated in a hospital in
Pakistan and died in June 2010, Denis Pierard, a microbiologist from
AZ VUB hospital in Brussels where the man had been treated, told Belgian media.

"He was involved in a car accident during a trip to Pakistan. He was
hospitalized with a major leg injury and then repatriated to Belgium,
but he was already infected," the doctor said. Despite being
administered colistin, a powerful antibiotic, the patient died.

He was infected by a bacterium that carried the gene New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) that makes ordinary bacteria such as
_E. coli_ resistant to [almost all] antibiotics. It was identified
last year [2009] in a Swedish patient admitted to hospital in India.

"The epicentre of the presence of this bacterium seems to be India
and Pakistan, but it appears through contact and travel, its spread
is becoming wider," said Youri Glupczynski from the University of Leuven.

An enzyme which makes bacteria resistant to "almost all antibiotics"
has reached Germany, the [German newspaper] Bild said, citing
information from the Robert Koch Institute, the federal institution
responsible for disease control and prevention.

There have been "individual, isolated proofs of bacteria that
produce" the gene, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM- 1), the
newspaper said, quoting the Institute.

Researchers in a Mumbai hospital had reported the presence of a
multi-drug resistant superbug in an article published in an Indian
medical journal, months before the Lancet study that has caused an
outrage in the country's medical fraternity and drawn criticism from
the government.

A team of researchers from Department of Medicine at PD Hinduja
National Hospital and Medical Research Centre had in March 2010
warned about the "superbug" in the Journal of the Association of
Physicians of India (JAPI).

Hinduja researchers had come to the conclusion after noticing 22
instances of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM-1) in 24 patients
between August and November 2009.

"This high number in a relatively short span is a worrisome trend
that compromises the treatment options with carbapenems (a type of
antibiotics used against multi-drug resistant infections)," the
article in JAPI said.

UK health authorities were this week [week of 15 Aug 2010] alerted to
an alarming jump in patients infected with a new and powerful type of
"superbug". The study identified 37 cases of patients infected with
bugs carrying the so-called NDM-1 gene, discovered in 2009 and found
to confer the almost total antibiotic resistance.

There were about another 140 cases detected across South Asia,
raising concerns India's role as a global hub for low-cost surgery
would spread the new powerful superbugs worldwide.

Professor Peter Collignon, head of infectious diseases at Canberra
Hospital, said Australia had recorded 3 NDM-1 cases. "At least 2 of
the people (infected) had been in hospitals in India and have come
back to Australia. We have to do what we can to stop these bugs from
coming into Australia ... for our common bugs to lose the miracle
drugs, it is a problem."

[There is every reason to assume that once introduced into a country
these organisms will persist by hospital-associated spread to other
patients. The only ways of preventing this spread are adequate
barrier protection, manifest primarily by aggressive hand washing,
and by rational use of antimicrobials to minimize the niche for these
pathogens. - Mod.LL]
