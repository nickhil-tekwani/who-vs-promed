Foot & mouth disease measures eased in Cyprus
---------------------------------------------
A Commission Decision to ease the foot and mouth disease (FMD)
restrictions in Cyprus was endorsed by the Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health today [10 Jan 2008]. In light of the
fact that there have been no new outbreaks of the disease since early
November [2007] and of the results of the sero-surveillance programme
that has been then implemented, it was agreed that the whole of
Cyprus could be categorised as a "low risk" zone. This means that
movement restrictions will no longer apply and the meat and products
of susceptible animals will be allowed to be traded without
significant restrictions.
However, as a precautionary measure and to comply with international
requirements, the export of live animals, semen and embryos from
Cyprus will still be banned. If the disease situation remains
favourable, all FMD measures for Cyprus are due to expire at the end
of January [2008].
The Standing Committee was also informed that all protection measures
related to FMD expired in Great Britain on 31 Dec 2007. The UK
reported its last outbreak of FMD in September 2007, and stringent
control measures were implemented to successfully contain and
eradicate the virus.

[The reporting of Cyprus to the OIE about this doubtful "outbreak" is
rather unusual. According to the WAHID interface, no immediate
notification, just a single "follow-up report" dated 13 Nov 2007, available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6470>.
At present, the "outbreak" is defined by OIE as "continuing."
Cyprus may consider submitting a complete report, summarising all
findings throughout the event, to enable the termination of the
costly, unnecessary movement and export restrictions. These
restrictions have been required in the absence of a first-hand,
transparent, scientifically-based explanation of the real FMD
situation on the island.
The last presentation of Cyprus on the FMD situation, as presented
during the 9-10 Jan 2008 meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), Section : ANIMAL HEALTH &
ANIMAL WELFARE, is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/fmd_910012008_cy.pdf>.
