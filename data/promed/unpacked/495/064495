On [Wed 26 Dec 2018], the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported veterinarians have diagnosed one case of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), in LaGrange County, Indiana. In addition, 2 other horses on the same property exhibited similar clinical signs.

"On 19 Dec 2018, the Indiana State veterinarian confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy in a 9-year-old Belgian mare in LaGrange County," the EDCC said. "The mare had an onset of clinical signs including recumbency (inability to rise), ataxia (incoodination), and general neurologic signs on [Thu 13 Dec 2018]."

Testing at Antech Laboratories via the University of California, Davis, confirmed EHV-1 infection on nasal swab PCR, the EDCC said.

"The mare and 2 other untested horses with similar signs were treated," the agency noted. "All 3 are recovering. The Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH) placed a quarantine on the premise on [20 Dec 2018], and the 21-day protocol of twice-daily temperatures is being followed. There is no evidence of spread off the farm. The situation is being monitored by BOAH and private practicing veterinarians."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, the 1st or only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness, or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

Herpesvirus is easily spread by nose-to-nose or close contact with an infectious horse; sharing contaminated equipment including bits, buckets, and towels; or clothing, hands, or equipment of people who have recently had contact with an infectious horse. Routine biosecurity measures, including hygiene and basic cleaning and disinfection practices, should be in place at all times to help present disease spread.

Current EHV-1 vaccines might reduce viral shedding but are not protective against the neurologic form of the disease. Implementing routine biosecurity practices is the best way to minimize viral spread, and the best method of disease control is disease prevention.

[The number of cases of EHM seemed to have slowed some, but there are no reports of vaccines or effective treatments for this disease.

Hopefully these animals will recover.

I look forward to the day this disease can be prevented or eradicated. - Mod.TG
