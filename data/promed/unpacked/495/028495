U.S. President Barack Obama says the United States will thoroughly investigate reports of chemical weapons use in Syria. Speaking in Jerusalem Wednesday [20 Mar 2013], Obama said any use of chemical weapons would be a "tragic mistake," adding that the administration was "deeply skeptical" of claims that rebel forces were behind a chemical weapons attack.

Earlier, the U.S. ambassador to Syria told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Wednesday [20 Mar 2013] that the United States has no evidence to support charges that chemical weapons were used this week in northern Syria. [See: http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/syria/2013/syria-130320-voa01.htm].

Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has claimed that rebels used chemical weapons near Aleppo, while the rebels claim Assad forces were responsible.

The Syrian government says it has asked U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons. The Syrian opposition has also asked for an independent investigation.

In London, British Prime Minister David Cameron told parliament that reports of a chemical attack in Syria strengthened the case for relaxing a European Union arms embargo on the country.
