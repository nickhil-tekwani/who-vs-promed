In the ongoing discussion related to the use of vaccines in the control and
eradication of FMD, one of the worldwide operating manufacturers of FMD
vaccines [Bayer believes it to be responsible to make a clear statement.
1. FMD vaccines are preparations of inactivated FMD virus of one or several
strains adjuvanted with an appropriate adjuvant e.g. Al(OH)3 (Aluminum
hydroxide), Saponin, Quil A or hydrocarbon systems. Vaccines are
manufactured according to the requirements of GMP (Good Manufacturing
Practice) and meet the requirements of the [drug manufacturing
regulations in the country of production.
2. Before vaccines can be sold on the market they have to be registered in
the country of origin and/or the country of use. As with all vaccines, FMD
vaccines have to pass a batch release test following the directions of the
[appropriate regulations. The most important tests in this regard are:
- Test for freedom [from bacteria and fungi
- Safety test (test for residual live FMD virus)
- Efficacy test.
Concerning safety, it must be confirmed the vaccine does not contain any
residual live FMD virus. This has to be done according to the European
Pharmacopeia (EP) in 3 different test systems:
- Inactivation kinetic, an in-process control, which proves there is not
one infectious virus particle in 10 000 liters of the sample
- 3 blind passages of the inactivated virus in susceptible tissue
culture
- target animal testing
As the FMD virus is inactivated with a "first order kinetic inactivant,"
e.g. BEI, there is a high [likelihood the vaccine is safe and will not
cause outbreaks of FMD.
With regard to efficacy, the vaccine has to pass a target animal potency
test. The minimal efficacy expressed in "Protective Doses 50 percent"
(PD50), and must be greater than 3. If the vaccine is intended for
emergency use, a higher PD 50 may be required. The efficacy of greater than
6 PD50 is considered appropriate for such cases. The testing for efficacy
is done in the target animal, either in a challenge trial or, if a
correlation has been shown between the challenge test result and a
serological response after vaccination, in a quantitative serological test,
e.g. antibody detection ELISA.
3. FMD vaccines manufactured and tested in this way are a useful tool in
the control and eradication of FMD.
This has been proven in many counties of the world, e.g.: Belgium, France,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain in Western Europe and Uruguay in Latin
America. It has been proven that even in cases of outbreaks in FMD-free
countries, emergency ring vaccination helps to regain FMD-free status,
provided all remaining control and eradication measures (the most important
of which are stamping out [the disease itself and [enforcing animal
movement restrictions) are performed in parallel with vaccination.
4. Discussion of emergency vaccination frequently includes the demand for
further R&D to improve vaccines and to develop vaccines that allow for
distinction between vaccination antibodies and infection antibodies.
The cost for such research and development is extremely high and the
probability of successfully marketing such a vaccine is quite low. As
evidence, it can be mentioned that animal health companies have developed
marker vaccines against classical swine fever with much effort. At the time
when such a marker vaccine is registered and ready to be marketed, the
demand is relatively low because of the current political and legislative
situation. This does not encourage pharmaceutical companies to risk
expensive R&D in further development of FMD Vaccines.
