Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever death toll reaches 241
--------------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 20 Apr 2005, the Health Ministry in Angola (MSA) said the Marburg
virus outbreak has now killed 241 people, the largest number of victims in
the world. Deputy health minister Jose Van Dunem said that although the MSA
has stepped up sanitation and assistance to the sick, the pandemic has
spread through 8 of the 18 provinces: Luanda, Cabinda, Kuanza Sul, Kuanza
Norte, Malanje, Zaire, Bengo, and Uige.
In total 264 people are currently infected, and another 513 who have had
contact with infected people are under surveillance. The government
appealed again to the population to prevent spread of the disease by
observing high standards of personal hygiene.

Angola: Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak - WHO update: 14 to 21 Apr 2005
-------------------------------------------------
As of 19 Apr 2005, the Ministry of Health in Angola has reported 266 cases
of Marburg haemorrhagic fever. Of these cases, 239 were fatal. In Uige
Province, which remains the epicentre of the outbreak, 250 cases, of which
228 were fatal, were reported as of 20 Apr 2005.
A team of 28 Angolese health care professionals, assembled by the
government, arrived today in Uige to provide further support to control
activities. They have been assigned to work on infection control,
surveillance for new cases, and the tracing and management of contacts, and
are being trained and equipped for these tasks. The new staff will also
join teams visiting communities within the affected municipalities in order
to improve public understanding of the disease and acceptance of control
measures. These teams are already supported by traditional community
leaders, known as Sobas, and local volunteers.
Public understanding of the disease and participation in the outbreak
response remain the most important factors influencing successful control.
Activities needed to prevent further transmission within the hospital
setting are well under way. In addition, protective gloves, soap, and
instructions about the importance of their use have been provided to
traditional healers and midwives.
Significant progress has been made in increasing the engagement of affected
communities. Some cases and deaths have, however, continued to occur within
the community. Efforts to rapidly isolate case, shortly after symptom
onset, and follow up contacts need to be further intensified.
Teams investigating recent deaths within the community have determined that
some families providing care in their homes are administering injections to
patients. This practice carries a high risk and can perpetuate transmission
within the community. Educational messages and materials communicating the
associated dangers were developed today and will be added to the
information already being provided to communities.

Angola: shared needle use persists
----------------------------------
At an isolation unit in northern Angola, health workers in gowns, masks and
gloves help a relative pull on full-body protective gear before she visits
one of the latest victims of the Marburg virus outbreak. Inside the ward,
visitors can only see the patient through a mask and are encouraged to stay
several metres from the bed by staff hoping to block further spread of the
Marburg epidemic that has killed 239 people. "It's very important for them
to see all of the effects of the condition on the patient," said Medicins
sans Frontieres nurse and medical coordinator Luis Encinas. "It is
important for us to show the family what is going on."
From the bottles of bleach that many families now keep by their doors to
the nervous schoolchildren who touch feet instead of shaking hands, Marburg
virus looms over the city. United Nations officials say they must [do] more
to keep the healthy away from the dead and dying where they are most at
risk of the disease, but they are becoming more upbeat. "We think things
are getting better," World Health Organisation spokesman Dave Daigle said
in an interview late on Wed 20 2005. "I think we're very near. We're
getting through to people. But I don't think anyone here in Uige would use
words like 'under control' and 'contained'."
Vehicles mounted with loudspeakers patrol the pot-holed streets in the
provincial capital Uige, where 50 000 people live in poverty after a 27
year civil war. The speakers broadcast the now popular "Marburg song" which
tells families to avoid contact with the sick. The disease, transmitted
through body fluids including blood, sweat and saliva, is at its most
contagious in the final hours. Visitors to many homes are now greeted with
a bowl of bleach and water to clean their hands and some schoolchildren now
touch feet instead of shake hands. Adults will often bow or curtsey rather
than risk body contact. "We're still going to school but we're really
trying to minimise contact," one teenage boy told Reuters.
With no cure for Marburg, the UN fears some may be going to traditional
healers and private clinics to seek treatment. Used syringes have been
found at the homes of some of victims of the deadly virus. "They're
injecting them with something they say can cure Marburg," said Daigle. "But
they're sharing syringes and that's very dangerous." Health officials are
meeting with traditional healers and local clinic staff in the hope of
tackling remaining problems.

[These 3 reports give slightly different totals (241 and 239) for the
number of deaths in the Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak in northern
Angola up to 20 Apr 2005. Information that is missing in both accounts is
the relative number of new cases as opposed to the number of
retrospectively diagnosed cases, which would give a better appreciation of
the success of the current containment measures. - Mod.CP]
