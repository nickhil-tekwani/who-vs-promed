[Although this report does not contain indications of clinical disease
in horses, other countries in Europe have reported clinical disease
since 2008 - namely Greece, Ireland, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and
Turkey. During this time frame, the United Kingdom, Portugal and
France reported to OIE that the disease was present but did not have
complete and quantitative information on number of outbreaks or
whether the disease was clinically apparent.

For comparative purposes. a rather large clinical outbreak of Equine
Piroplasmosis did occur in Texas and spread to other parts of the
United in 2009 and 2010 - Mod.PC

"The parasites responsible for equine piroplasmosis are _Babesia caballi_
and _Theileria equi_. Ticks ingest blood from infected equines and
then bite uninfected equines, spreading the disease through the
blood-feeding process.
Ticks carrying the parasites can be moved from one place to another
via hay, bedding, feed and animal to animal.

"The disease may also be passed from pregnant mares to foals in the
uterus and by contaminated needles and other skin-penetrating
instruments. Horses which contract the disease in the USA are usually
euthanized to eliminate the risk of spread.

"Signs may become apparent 7 to 22 days after infection. Clinical
signs include weakness, loss of appetite, fever, anemia, jaundiced
mucous membranes, swollen abdomen and labored breathing. Horses that
survive the acute infection phase may carry the parasites for an
undetermined period of time in their bloodstreams."
