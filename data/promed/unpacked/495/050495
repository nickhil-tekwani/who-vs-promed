Livestock farms in several districts of the Eastern Province have
been hit by an unknown disease that is causing cattle to miscarry.

Dr. Jean de Dieu Niyitanga, the head of livestock in Rwamagana
District, said most farmers in the Eastern Province have reported
high rates of miscarriages on their farms.

He reiterated that most rural farmers in the districts are waiting
with bated breath to know the cause and ultimate treatment of their animals.

"Bugesera, Rwamagana, Ngoma and Kayonza have registered significant
losses. We had suspected brucellosis, but the results so far are
proving us wrong," he said.

Dr. Isidore Gafarasi, the head of Veterinary Services, said that ever
since the problem was reported, blood samples have been taken for
tests in Kenya, Uganda, South Africa and Britain to ascertain the
cause of the miscarriages.

"We are working around the clock to find out the causes. The 1st
results that came were negative, but we are waiting for the next
blood test results from the UK. We shall soon act accordingly,"
Gafarasi told The New Times.

Alfred Musoni, a farmer, said the problem started after massive
vaccination against anthrax a couple of months ago, adding that he
believes the vaccine could have triggered the miscarriages.

"Loss of any pregnancy represents a significant loss of (potential)
income to a farmer, and appropriate action should therefore be taken
to check the problem and establish the cause," he said.

Livestock farming in the Eastern Province has increased since the
introduction of One Cow per Poor Family programme. Some people's
livelihoods depend solely on cattle rearing.

[I know of no reports of abortion in relation to the use of Sterne
vaccine. If it caused even a small percentage of abortions, it would
have been long noted. But just to make sure, it would be worth
checking the vaccine for contaminants. I do know of abortion storms
in relation to FMD vaccines which were live instead of being dead;
usually late pregnancies are most at risk from FMD infections, other
than lost implantations. The former results in a dead calf, the
latter in a return to service. Leptospira and brucella can cause
abortion storms. If they are feeding hay at this time, mycotic
abortion should be considered. - Mod.MHJ]

[The following slightly edited and summarised data on abortions in
cattle are derived from the Merck Veterinary Manual:

Abortions in cattle

1. Infectious Causes
Neosporosis
Bovine Viral Diarrhea (BVD)
Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR, Bovine Herpesvirus 1)
Leptospirosis
Brucellosis
Mycotic Abortion
_Arcanobacterium pyogenes_
Trichomoniasis
Campylobacteriosis
Listeriosis
Chlamydophilosis (Chlamydiosis)
_Ureaplasma diversum_ Infection
Epizootic Bovine Abortion (Foothill Abortion)

Other infectious causes of Abortion:
Bluetongue virus and Akabane virus (where present) cause abortion and
fetal anomalies. Parainfluenza-3 virus causes abortion in
experimentally inoculated seronegative cattle but is seldom, if ever,
diagnosed in field cases of abortion. Occasionally, Salmonella spp
cause abortion storms. The cows are usually sick, and the fetuses and
placentas are autolyzed and emphysematous.

Salmonellae can be isolated from the abomasal contents and fetal
tissues. Mycoplasma spp , _Histophilus somni_ (_Haemophilus somnus_),
and a wide variety of other bacteria can also cause sporadic
abortions in cattle.

2. Noninfectious Causes

Vitamins A and E, selenium, and iron have been implicated in bovine
abortions, but documentation based on experiments is available only
for vitamin A.

Heat stress causes fetal hypotension, hypoxia, and acidosis. High
maternal temperature due to pyrexia may be more important than
environmentally induced heat stress.

While severe trauma may rarely result in abortion (the bovine fetus
is well protected by the amniotic fluid), farmers undoubtedly blame
too many abortions on the cow "getting bumped."

A number of toxins can cause abortion in cows. Ponderosa pine needles
can cause abortion if ingested in the last trimester; the cows may
become moribund after delivery and hemorrhage excessively. The toxic
factor is believed to be estrogenic. Locoweed (Oxytropis or
Astragalus sp) contains an indolizidine alkaloid that can affect the
corpus luteum, chorioallantois, and neurons, resulting in abortion or
deformities. Broomweed (_Guttierrezia microcephala_) ingestion can
also cause abortion, as can coumarins from rat poison, many grasses,
or moldy sweet clover.

Mycotoxins, especially those with estrogenic activity, have been
implicated in bovine abortions. Nitrates or nitrites have also been
incriminated, but experimental evidence is controversial.

The list of infectious abortifacient agents could have included also
RVF virus; this agent deserves to be included in Rwanda's testing
list. Pestiviruses (eg BVDV) may contaminate live vaccines produced
on tissue cultures. Anthrax vaccine (which is, most probably, the
widely-used Living Spore Sterne Anthrax vaccine, initially developed
in 1935) is not such a vaccine and is generally regarded as a safe
and efficient vaccine. However, the vaccine batch(es) applied in
Rwanda deserve to be tested for safety to address the reported
allegations. Mass vaccinations may, at times, cause problems --
including abortions -- if needles are not changed between animals or
farms, potentially becoming mechanical transmitters of infectious
agents (e.g. bluetongue, RVF etc.).

Results of the lab tests are expected with interest. - Mod.AS]
