The Mexican National Human Rights Commission [NHRC] requested a public
hospital to investigate the cases of 2 children who were infected with HIV
[human immunodeficiency virus], the virus that causes AIDS [acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome], on whom they performed blood transfusions in 2008.

The governmental committee asked the La Raza Hospital in Mexico City to
investigate whether there are other patients who were infected, but their
recommendations are not mandatory. According to the NHRC, the hospital
failed to comply with norms on testing, classification, and handling of blood.

On Sunday [9 Aug 2009], the commission reported that the affected patients
were a 10 year old child and an adolescent of 13 years. In addition, there
was another report of an infection identified in a relative of a person
cared for in the same hospital.

[HIV transmission by blood transfusion is rare and almost always a
consequence of laxity in the testing and handling of blood and blood
products. The precise route of transmission in this incident has yet to be
established. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
