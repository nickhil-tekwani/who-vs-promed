[There have now been a total of 1220 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 520 deaths reported from Saudi Arabia since June 2012. Today's newly confirmed cases reported are noteworthy for 3 of the 4 coming from Riyadh, signaling that the outbreak in Riyadh is continuing with the total number of cases reported from Riyadh since 21 Jul 2015 now at 155. The confirmation of a case from Madinah is disconcerting with the Hajj beginning in these coming days -- curiously this case gave a history of contact with known case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. One wonders where this contact occurred as the most recent case reported from Madinah was on
12 Feb 2015.

[2] Jordan, 1 new fatal case - MOH media report
Date: Mon 7 Sep 2015

A 78-year-old man infected with the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV], died on [Mon 7 Sep 2015] bringing the death toll from the SARS-like virus to 4 in Jordan, the Health Ministry confirmed.

Director of the ministry's communicable disease control department, Mohammad Abdullat, said the deceased was suffering from blood cancer, diabetes, and hypertension and had been diagnosed with the virus earlier after he was admitted to a private hospital.

MERS is considered a deadlier but less infectious cousin of the SARS virus that appeared in Asia in 2003 and killed hundreds of people, mostly in China.

Its symptoms can include fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. There are no approved vaccines against MERS, which is believed to originate in camels.

[This makes the 7th case of MERS-CoV reported by Jordan since the beginning of the year (2015), and the 4th fatality. Presumably this case is part of the cluster of nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV in Amman.
