[In today's [26 Jun 2016] update, there are 2 newly reported cases in household contacts of previously confirmed cases, one in a healthcare worker in Najran, the other in Riyadh. Since 1 Jun 2016, there have been 3 cases of MERS-CoV confirmed in Najran, the 1st an 82-year-old male reported on 18 Jun 2016, classified as a primary case with no known history of contact with camels and reported as a fatality on 23 Jun 2016; the 2nd was in a 44-year-old male reported on 19 Jun 2016, also classified as a primary case but with high risk exposure to camels still under investigation, and this current case, a 28-year-old male healthcare worker, but classified as a secondary case in a household contact.

As for the newly confirmed case in Riyadh, the individual is reported to be an asymptomatic secondary case in a household contact. A question that comes to mind is whether the household contact case of this newly reported case was a previously reported symptomatic case or perhaps an asymptomatic case on home isolation? There have now been 22 asymptomatic infections with MERS-CoV infection in this ongoing "outbreak" in the King Khaled University Hospital in Riyadh, and 6 symptomatic infections. To the best of my knowledge and memory, this is the largest "outbreak" of asymptomatic infections with MERS-CoV in contacts of confirmed cases reported to date. Questions that come to mind include whether the virus has changed and/or whether the laboratory testing protocol has changed. One wonders about the frequency of testing of contacts; are contacts tested regularly throughout the 14-day incubation period to identify all potential infections? If anyone has answers to these questions, it would be greatly appreciated if they could be shared with ProMED-mail.
