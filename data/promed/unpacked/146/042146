Local, federal and state agencies continue to investigate the Amarillo [Texas] botulism outbreak, with lab tests continuing despite negative results. But they think the tainted food involved was not from a public source.

"It can be difficult because of the time delay between the onset of symptoms and when the samples were shipped. The toxin may be in such small amounts, it's hard to detect," said Deree Duke, head of the city's environmental health department. "It's been clinically confirmed. All the experts across the country confirmed the diagnosis."

Botulism is caused by a toxin released by a bacterium [_Clostridium botulinum_]. It can cause a paralysis that moves from the head downward. It can affect the diaphragm, stopping a victim from breathing, according to information from the CDC. There are an average of 145 cases reported in the USA annually. The apparent cause of the botulism cases is homemade food called turshi, a traditional Middle Eastern dish of fermented vegetables.

"Investigators believe that during the fermentation phase of preparation lasting several weeks, conditions were ideal for bacteria growth and botulinum toxin production," according to a news release. "No commercial food product or restaurant has been linked to the outbreak. No new cases have been added to the outbreak of 4, and there is no reason to believe this contaminating product is a threat to the general public."

Health care workers reported the 1st case 9 Dec 2013, and an investigation found the other victims who knew each other. Two patients are still in a local hospital.

"One remained on a ventilator this afternoon," Duke said. "My understanding is it will be removed in the near future." Officials said the outbreak is not a public health threat. "It is also important to note that commercially available turshi was not implicated in the investigation," the release states.

[Turshi (spelled differently in different countries) are the pickled vegetables (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tursu) of the cuisines of many Balkan and Middle Eastern countries. The word comes from the Persian word torsh, which means "sour". Turshi is common in Afghan, Persian, Pakistani, Mesopotamian, Turkish, Middle Eastern, Albanian, Armenian, Greek, Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Bosnian cuisine. Iran boasts a great variation of hundreds of different types according to regional customs and different events. In some families, no meal is considered complete without a bowl on the table. In Bulgarian cuisine the most popular types are tsarska turshiya ("king's pickle") and selska turshiya ("country pickle").

Fermented foods can be associated with botulism. The following is from Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 2007; 56; 96-97 http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5605a2.htm?s_cid=mm5605a2_e:

"Historically, most foodborne botulism cases in the USA result from consumption of improperly prepared home-canned foods (1). However, fermented foods, including fish, seal, and whale, also have been associated with botulism. Fermented tofu is popular in Asia, and homemade fermented bean products, including tofu, are the most common foods causing botulism in China. During 1958-1989, home-fermented bean products were associated with 63 percent of approximately 2000 cases of botulism in China (3).
