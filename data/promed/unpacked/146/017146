A Further Comment
-----------------
I think a few things need to be clarified:
1) The seasonal discrepancy, not some geographic distinction, between the
Northern and Southern hemisphere is the important factor in influenza
vaccination. Winter (the peak time for influenza cases) occurs between
December and February in the Northern Hemisphere, but between May and July
in the Southern Hemisphere, thereby necessitating vaccinations at different
dates in the calendar.
2) Decisions regarding the influenza vaccine formulation are made
approximately 6 months before the peak influenza season and are based on
the virus isolates made during the previous influenza season. Therefore,
each hemisphere has its own formulation.
3) The current influenza virus vaccine provides protection against the
influenza virus circulating in either hemisphere. By definition, viruses in
the same serotype induce antibodies that cross-react with viruses in that
serotype. For example, any H3 influenza virus will induce antibodies that
cross-react with other H3 influenza viruses. Since the vaccine is
formulated to provide OPTIMAL protection against the strains circulating in
the PREVIOUS year of one hemisphere, that vaccine SHOULD provide BETTER
protection in that hemisphere.
4) Protection induced by the inactivated whole virus influenza vaccine
lasts 6-15 months and is only 60-80% effective. Therefore, antibody titers
induced by immunization before the peak influenza virus season in one
hemisphere may be waning by the peak influenza virus season in the other
hemisphere (6 months later), thereby further reducing vaccine efficacy.
Why the vaccine from one hemisphere is not available in the other
hemisphere to vaccinate travelers is not clear to me: perhaps a
CDC/FDA/pharmaceutical industry expert could comment?
