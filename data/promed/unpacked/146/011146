I read with interest the description of the mishandling of the hams used in
the church supper that resulted in a major _Salmonella_ outbreak. I was
equally interested in the moderator's parenthetical comment that he/she
would bet a holiday meal that mistakes were also made in the packing house
and on the farm.
It could make an interesting dialogue to determine how that bet outcome
would be finally decided, and by inference, whether the farm is the
appropriate location to place the control bacterial contamination of foods.
What categories of mistakes could the production unit and processor have
made to cause this illness episode?
Why should livestock producers be held as accountable (mod. inference) as
those who obviously abused the process? The information that 6-8% of swine
are salmonella positive (USDA reference) at slaughter probably greatly
underestimates the percentage of pigs exposed and recovered from
subclinical _Salmonella_ infections in the grow-finish period. The problem
is that short of microbial examination of these animals, such a
determination could not be made using currently known information. Serology
will indicate prior exposure, but not the current carrier status.
This is a discussion that needs serious attention from a wide range of
disciplines. It is far too facile to state that bacterial contamination of
foodstuffs must originate with mistakes on the farm or production facility.
Without meaningful and scientifically sound discussions about the critical
control points for bacterial contamination of meats, the USA food supply
may be disrupted by inappropriate control measures which do not increase
the food safety levels of the foods we eat.

I agree it usually takes a multitude of untoward events for an outbreak.
It is a multivariate problem. I was interested that your final comment
mentioned the role and responsibility of the farmer/producer. What would
be your weighting factor for that variable [on farm of the equation
describing the factors involved?
Enjoying holiday dinners...,

[Thanks to Jim McKean for sharpening the discussion. I decided to digest
his comments rather than choking on them, for he does raise some excellent
points and I am grateful to him moving the discussion "down the field". He
correctly points out that farmers did not make any mistakes similar in
scale to that which the cooks made in the Maryland case. As far as we know
(which is not very much), the farms and slaughterhouses that produced the
hams in question did everything "correctly" as per their standard operating
procedures. This covers errors of commission and I am glad Jim has
clarified that aspect.
I am concerned about errors of omission, however. Producers of hams, like
anyone else producing any product, have an obligation to ensure quality.
Programs that include continuous quality improvements have become the
standard and help revive many industries. Such notions are the
underpinnings of an HACCP based approach to food safety. But 6-8%
contamination wouldn't necessarily allow the producers to say "I have
produced a high quality product and you can look elsewhere for food safety
continuos improvements". The acceptable standard is determined by the
market, and large outbreaks with human death as occurred in Maryland can
only have a negative impact on the market for hams. So I did not intend for
previous comments to infer that producers were responsible for the Maryland
outbreak but only that they had a role to play in food safety.
My supposition is that the kind of preparation phase mishandling seen in
Maryland will occur from time to time, people being human and therefore
fallible. If a low probability of contamination product were to leave the
farm and packing house, then the chances of an outbreak would be reduced.
Only when a cascade of mistakes occur on the consumption phase of the food
continuum do lost opportunities for increasing food safety on the
production and processing side of the food continuum have a measurable
impact on public health. My proposition of a holiday dinner wager should
have distinguished and focused on these lost opportunities for food safety
rather than implying there were mistakes made.
What are these lost opportunities for food safety? Unfortunately, as Scott
Hurd mentions, we do not have good population based data which quantitates
the relative importance of each step in the food production and consumption
process. The first comprehensive "farm to table" risk assessment for food
safety is still in the works. Lacking such data and other farm based
studies we cannot recommend specific procedures to effectively reduce
_Salmonella_ levels on swine farms. Furthermore, we have to identify cost
effective solutions or the price of safe food will go up.
Fortunately, with the exception of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. birthday
celebration, the next holidays on the calendar demand either fasting or
moon cakes and I do not think even I can get into any trouble with those.
Whoops! I just hit that blinking send button. Can I have it back? Moon
cakes, fasting, food safety, please just save your cards and letters. -
