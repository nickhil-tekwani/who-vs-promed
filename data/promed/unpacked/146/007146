Russian and American scientists are planning to work together to develop a
new vaccine against smallpox with the help of genetic engineering. The
existing vaccines are not harmless and can bring about complications that
can prove fatal for AIDS patients. Smallpox was believed o have been fully
obliterated but an epidemic [of monkeypox in Zaire a few ears ago
destroyed the optimistic view.
Researchers from Atlanta, USA, and Novosibirsk, Russia are the only ones in
he world who can effectively test the new vaccine.
[The Zaire epidemic referred to is most likely the monkeypox epidemic in
1997. The 18 July 1997 issue of Science had a quote from a USAMRIID
virologist "I hate to be accused of pushing the alarmist button, but for
practical purposes smallpox is back" and a CDC
epidemiologist "I am personally concerned about what would happen if this
disease showed up in a major city". During the monkeypox epidemic there
was discussion re: vaccination with smallpox vaccine to interrupt
transmission. There were concerns raised about the use of the vaccine in a
population with a high prevalence of HIV infection. - MPP
