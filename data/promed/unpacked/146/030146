On 20 May 2013, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) received a report from a hospital concerning a case of human infection with unsubtypable influenza A virus in a 20-year-old female presenting with mild pneumonia who resides in central Taiwan. The virus isolated from the respiratory specimen from the case was then submitted to Taiwan CDC for further identification. After conducting whole genome sequencing, the National Influenza Center (NIC) at Taiwan CDC identified the virus to be a novel avian-origin influenza A (H6N1) virus. A total of 36 close contacts of the case have been traced for follow-up. Four of them experienced influenza-like illness symptoms, but none of them has been found to be infected with influenza A (H6N1) virus. Taiwan CDC continues to closely monitor influenza activity and advises the public to seek immediate medical attention when experiencing any influenza-like illness with respiratory distress.

According to the epidemiological investigation, the case works at a breakfast shop. She has not traveled out of the country and has not been exposed to any poultry or birds. On [5 May 2013], she developed symptoms, including fever, cough, headache and muscle ache. On [8 May 2013], when her fever persisted and she developed shortness of breath, she sought medical attention at a hospital and was hospitalized for treatment. Her chest X-ray showed mild pneumonia. After administering Oseltamivir, her symptoms improved the next day. On [11 May 2013], she was discharged from the hospital. As of now, she has fully recovered.

Influenza A (H6N1) virus was isolated from the respiratory specimen collected from the case on [7 May 2013]. The case was found to have an antibody titer of 1:20 in the serum specimen collected on [24 May 2013]. Another serum specimen was collected from the case on [8 Jun 2013], and the antibody titer in this specimen was found to be 1:40. Besides testing the respiratory specimen collected from the case for influenza viruses, the NIC also tested the specimen for 23 other common respiratory viruses such as adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, enterovirus and rhinovirus, and the specimen tested negative for all these viruses. The agricultural authority has collected specimens from the poultry from the 2 poultry farms located within the one-km perimeter of the case's residence. No avian influenza A (H6N1) virus has been detected in any of the specimens.

Beginning in 1999, besides testing specimens from patients with notifiable infectious diseases such as influenza-related complications, Taiwan CDC regularly collects specimens from patients with influenza-like illness in the community and hospitalized patients with pneumonia of unknown origin to test for influenza viruses and systematically monitors domestic influenza virus activity and the actual clinical situation (patient visits for influenza-like illness). Each year, on average, approximately 10 000 to 20 000 specimens have been tested. As of now, a cumulative total of 250 000 specimens have been tested. 86 000 influenza virus strains have been isolated and identified from the specimens. Besides this H6N1 strain and the imported H7N9 strain detected in 2013, no other non-H1/H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses have been detected in humans in Taiwan.

An expert meeting attended by the agricultural authority and related medical experts and veterinary experts was convened to discuss the case. Based on the results of the epidemiological investigation, the case presenting with mild pneumonia is a sporadic case, and testing of the close contacts of the cases has not yielded any evidence of human-to-human transmission of this virus in the community. Both the health and agricultural authorities will continue to reinforce avian influenza surveillance in humans, poultry and the environment.

Avian influenza A (H6N1) virus is a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus commonly circulating in the domestic bird population, and the virus had not been previously detected in humans. The genome sequence of the virus isolated from the case is found to be of avian-origin and closely resembles avian influenza A (H6N1) virus in domestic poultry. The virus is also sensitive to influenza antivirals, including Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, according to the sequencing data.

To prevent avian-to-human transmission of avian influenza infections, poultry vendors are advised to take personal precautions and the general public to avoid unnecessary direct contact with poultry and birds or their droppings. In addition, the public is also advised to practice good personal hygiene such as washing hands frequently and consuming only thoroughly cooked poultry and eggs to reduce the risk of infection.

[This report describes a single mild case of pneumonia attributable to infection with avian A/H6N1 influenza virus, a low-pathogenic avian influenza virus commonly circulating in the domestic bird population of Taiwan and not previously detected in humans. The patient had no involvement with poultry, and none of her contacts showed evidence of H6N1 virus infection. No other respiratory viruses appeared to be co-factors. Furthermore, none of 86 000 influenza virus strains that had been isolated and characterised previously by the Taiwan CDC had been identified as avian A/H6N1 influenza virus, and other than this H6N1 strain and the H7N9 virus imported from China in 2013, no other non-H1/H3 subtypes influenza A viruses have been detected in humans in Taiwan.

This case appears to be a unique event and not the precursor to an incipient epidemic. Curiously, the patient displayed a rather poor immune response to infection, and if she had not been not treated with oseltamivir at an early stage, the outcome might have been more severe. The poor immune response may have been a factor also in the victim's susceptibility to H6N1 virus infection.

A significant feature of this report is that the H6N1 isolate was characterised by whole genome analysis, which excludes any ambiguities and may, in the longer, term facilitate identification of genetic factors relevant in host switching.

The Taiwan CDC is to be commended for the thoroughness of this analysis. - Mod.CP
