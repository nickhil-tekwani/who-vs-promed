According to the state sanitary surveillance department of Almaty,
over the last year, 4 cases of botulism were registered, one fatal.
The disease is associated with home-made preserved food, including
vegetables and mushrooms. It can be also associated with buying food
from unreliable local salesmen.
According to physicians, 90 percent of botulism cases are associated
with homemade preserved mushrooms, vegetables, fruit, tinned food and
with sausages as well. Botulism toxins appear during improper thermal
processing, drying or inadequate use of salts, acids and other
preservatives.
Botulism is a rare but severe poisoning. Physicians are warning that
people should not use preserved food if there is mold on walls of
cans or if there is swelling of contents. Also it is not recommended
to home-preserve foods like meat, fish and mushrooms.
