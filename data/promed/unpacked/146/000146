Fungicide poisoning, Coca Cola - Belgium 990615211523

See: http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/news/index.html
Coca-Cola's press release claims that the exterior bottom portion of some
soda cans was contaminated with fungicide residue from treated wooden
pallets. There is currently no indication that the beverages were
contaminated nor that the chemical was ingested. It appears that some
children may have been reacting to fungicide odors. Therefore, based on
available information, it seems unlikely that affected individuals suffered
"fungicide poisoning," which implies systemic toxicity. The described health
effects probably represent cases of odor-stimulated pesticide-related
illness.
Full investigation by health authorities will be required to determine the
identity of the suspect fungicide, the exact nature of the contamination,
the exposure / dose, the adverse health effects and the plausibility of a
causal association. It may be difficult to distinguish between sympathetic
reactions (mass hysteria) and true pesticide-related illness when the only
reported adverse health effects are non-specific symptoms resulting from a
subjective reaction to unpleasant odors.
It's possible that this "poisoning" incident would have escaped widespread
notice if not for the public's heightened sensitivity to food safety issues
in the wake of Belgium's recent dioxin contamination crises.

[Dr Marjorie Pollack also suggested to us that the outbreak could
have been due to hysteria. We await futher information - Mod.JW
