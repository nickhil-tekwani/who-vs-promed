To address the question as to whether this recalled involved human cases of scombroid poisoning we contacted the EpiCore Surveillance Project members and we have received the following responses:

One member reminded there was an outbreak involving human cases in Australia during 2015 associated with canned tuna fish from Thailand (thanks to EpiCore member John Cathey). See ProMED-mail post Scombroid fish poisoning - Australia: (NS) canned tuna 20150301.3193848 and the reference John Cathey supplied: http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Canned-tuna-from-Thailand-under-scrutiny-30254910.html.

Another member stated there didn't seem to be any human cases of scombroid fish poisoning associated with this recalled product. But reminded us that scombroid fish poisoning is not a legally notifiable disease in Singapore, hence, the absence of reports does not rule out the possibility of cases (my favorite adage - 'seek and ye shall find'). There was mention that there were approximately 3 cases of scombroid food poisoning reported in 2015 that were linked to tuna and salmon. There was no mention as to whether the implicated fish was fresh fish or canned fish. Also, other fishes that are known to cause scombroid poisoning are mackerel and mahi mahi.

A 3rd member stated that there had not been any cases reported associated with this product as yet.

[As always our thanks goes out to the EpiCore Surveillance Project members for their willingness to respond to requests for information helping to validate information received from non-traditional information sources.

Of note, the outbreak of scombroid poisoning associated with canned tuna from Thailand that had human cases in 2015, was the only outbreak of scombroid poisoning identified associated with canned rather than fresh fish that was covered in the ProMED-mail archives. Several of the outbreaks were associated with tuna sandwiches but did not specify if the tuna was fresh tuna or canned tuna.

Searching Pubmed I was able to find an article from 1974 on a scombroid outbreak associated with canned fish:
Merson MH, Baine WB, Gangarosa EJ, Swanson RC. Scombroid fish poisoning. Outbreak traced to commercially canned tuna fish. JAMA. 1974 Jun 3;228(10):1268-9, abstract available at: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=354813.
