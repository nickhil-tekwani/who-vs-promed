At least 20 persons, including children, have reportedly been infected with anthrax after handling and eating a buffalo in Rajshahi's Makranda village. Confirming this, Godagari upazila Livestock Officer Saiful Islam told The Daily Star that those infected got admitted to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, Godagari upazila health complex and private clinics over the past couple of days.

"We are vaccinating all of the village's cattle and buffaloes and so we are expecting no further threats," he said. He informed that some 600 cattle and 400 buffaloes have so far been vaccinated in Pakri union since the disease was detected.

There is nothing to panic as the infected people are being treated by specialised doctors, said Dr Md Towhidul Islam of the health complex.

Villagers said a farmer bought the animal from Rajshahi City Haat on 9 Sep [2016], slaughtered it the next day after it fell sick and sold the meat. Rofiqul Islam, a local, said those infected complained of fever and developed rashes on body parts. A medical camp has been set up at the village in Pakri union for providing free treatment while the department of livestock services is providing necessary vaccines.

In August, some 20 persons were infected with anthrax at Khirsintikor village of Poba upazila.

[This is much the same as the previous report when 10 people were affected except that now they have started vaccinating the 600 head of cattle and 400 buffalo in Pakri. Most if not all infected people should have been identified and treated by now.
