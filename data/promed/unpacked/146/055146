[Given that in 2. above both "the patient and her husband developed symptoms" it would be useful to know what happened to the husband, too, whether his tests were positive. - Mod.SH]

[As of [Tue 16 May 2017], a total of 1486 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses, including at least 571 deaths, have been reported to WHO. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) viruses and the geographical distribution of human cases in the 5th epidemic wave (that is, onset since 1 Oct 2016) is greater than in any earlier wave [http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_05_16_2017.pdf?ua=1]. This suggests that the virus is spreading, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sectors are crucial. - Mod.UBA
