The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) announced on 27 Aug 2018 that another horse from the Hampton Roads area had contracted eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] via the bite of an infected mosquito and has been euthanized.

The animal, an American Quarter Horse stabled in Chesapeake, is the 2nd to be diagnosed with EEE and the 2nd fatality from the disease in August 2018. Earlier in August 2018, a Quarter Horse mare stabled in the Suffolk area also succumbed to the illness, which has a fatality rate of 80-90 percent.

According to the VDACS, both of the horses had an "incomplete vaccination history."

For full effectiveness, horses must receive the initial vaccination and a booster, then be re-vaccinated every 6-12 months, said Elaine Lidholm, communications director for VDACS.

Sometimes called sleeping sickness, Lidholm said EEE is a mosquito-borne illness causing inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Signs include impaired vision, aimless wandering, head pressing, circling, inability to swallow, irregular staggering gait, paralysis, convulsions and death.

Once a horse has been bitten by an infected mosquito, it may take 3 to 10 days for signs of the disease to appear.

Besides vaccination, recommended prevention methods include eliminating standing water that can provide breeding sites for mosquitoes, the use of insect repellents, and removing animals from mosquito-infested areas during peak biting times, usually dusk to dawn.

Garvin said horse owners should consult their veterinarians if an animal exhibits any neurological signs such as a stumbling gait, falling down, facial paralysis, drooping, or disinterest in their surroundings.

[It is good to see a recommendation for complete vaccination for equines as well as mosquito control. If you have not vaccinated your horse, please do so. - Mod.TG
