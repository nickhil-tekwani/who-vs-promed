Avian influenza in Sudan
------------------------
Information received on 8 May 2006 (up to 7 May) from Dr Ahmed Mustafa
Hassan, undersecretary, Federal Ministry of Animal Resources, Khartoum:
End of previous report period: 18 Apr 2006 (Disease Information 2006;
19[16]: 342, 20 Apr)
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 25 Mar 2006.
Diagnosis (laboratory confirmation):
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: OIE/FAO Reference
Laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease, Padova, Italy
The following results were obtained on 5 May 2006: RT-PCR was positive for
H5; virus isolation was positive for H5N1; sequence analysis and RT-PCR-
virus isolation sequence analysis deduced an amino acid sequence at
cleavage site, revealing a HPAI profile.
Other details/comments:
A new outbreak has been identified at Atbara, in River Nile State, 250 km
to the north of Khartoum. New outbreaks have also been reported in Gezira
State in 4 poultry farms located 40 to 50 km to the south of Khartoum town.*
Final report: no.
*Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Further details of
these outbreaks have been requested.

[A map of Sudan, with Atbara and Gezira identified, can be seen at
<http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm>. These results
appear to have been from the suspected H5 reported to OIE on 20 Apr 2006
(Disease Information 2006; 19(16). They do not appear to refer to the newly
reported outbreaks north in Atbara and south of Khartoum in Gezira,
detailed information about which we hope will soon be published.
Previous reports had outbreaks of unconfirmed H5N1 around Khartoum. Spread
of significant distances from the 1st outbreaks in April 2006 is a definite
step back in the fight against AI in Africa, and time does not appear to be
our friend in this situation. Any concerted actions by the international
community should proceed with speed if possible. - Mod.PC]
