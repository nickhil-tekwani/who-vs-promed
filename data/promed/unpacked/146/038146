Two new soybean-infecting viruses have been discovered. The 1st
virus, Soybean vein necrosis virus (SVNV), was detected in Tennessee
in 2008 and in Illinois and Kentucky in 2009. SVNV infections
initially induce vein clearing that becomes necrotic as leaves
mature, which leads to large necrotic regions on leaves.

The 2nd virus, Soybean yellow mottle mosaic virus (SYMMV) was 1st
reported from soybean plants in South Korea and then in southern
Mississippi in 2009. Like SVNV, SYMMV initially induces vein necrosis
shortly after inoculation, but then induces bright yellow mosaic on
systemic leaves and eventually stunting and reduced growth of older leaves.

Little is known about the economic impacts, insect vectors or sources
of inoculum for the viruses.

[Around 50 viruses have been reported to affect soybean in various
parts of the world. They cause yield losses due to a range of
symptoms on leaves and seeds and may be major limiting factors in
soybean production.

Preliminary classification of Soybean vein necrosis virus (SVNV) has
placed it in the genus _Tospovirus_ (family _Bunyaviridae_), although
it appears to have minimal similarity to characterised members of the
genus. Many tospoviruses are transmitted by thrips, and these insects
are also being investigated as possible vectors of SVNV.

Soybean yellow mottle mosaic virus (SYMMV) is considered to be a new
member of the genus _Carmovirus_ (family _Tombusviridae_). It is most
similar to, but distinct from, _Cowpea mottle virus_ which is
transmitted by beetles and through seed. The Korean and US isolates
of SYMMV have been shown to have 96 percent nucleotide sequence
homology of genomic RNA. This suggests that different viral strains
may be present in Korea and the US and that additional strains may
occur in other locations.

Disease management of crop viruses may include cultural techniques,
phytosanitary measures, vector control and use of crop cultivars
resistant to the virus and/or the vectors. More information is needed
about the new viruses before specific management strategies can be designed.
