Ebola Fever Discounted As Cause Of Deaths In Democratic Republic of Congo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: At least 5 people have died of [a hemorrhagic fever in the town
of Bunia in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), but earlier
fears that they had contracted Ebola hemorrhagic fever have proved
unfounded, a Ugandan health ministry official said here on Fri 5 Jan 2001.
"The results of the blood tests came back from the South African laboratory
on Friday afternoon, and we heard that the results are negative. It is a
great relief," Uganda Medical Services Director-General Francis Omaswa told
AFP.
Earlier on Friday, the Health Ministry's Communicable Diseases Director,
Fred Okware, told journalists that 5 people had died in Bunia from a form
of hemorrhagic fever suspected to be Ebola fever. He said Uganda had put
its officials on alert at the border of the DRC on news of the deaths.
Bunia is controlled by the Ugandan-backed rebels of the Congolese Rally for
Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML). Since mid-September, at least 172
people have died in Uganda from Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Initially there
were fears that Ebola [virus could have been imported from the DRC by
Ugandan soldiers posted there, but it was later found that the strain [of
Ebola virus in the Ugandan outbreak was more closely related to the virus
responsible for a previous outbreak in Sudan. Meanwhile, there have been no
new cases of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Uganda for the past 12 days,
indicating that the epidemic may soon be at an end.
