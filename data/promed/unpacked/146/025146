AVIAN CHOLERA - CANADA (NUNAVUT)

Scientists are trying to find answers to why hundreds of common eider
ducks have died near Coral Harbour this summer. In the last 2months,
researchers counted 1500 dead birds in one breeding colony on
Southampton Island, in the north-central Arctic, about 715 kilometres
southwest of Iqaluit. The colony is the largest known in Nunavut,
with more than 4000 nesting birds. "To have over 1000 females die in
a single summer over a matter of weeks is quite an outbreak," said
Grant Gilchrist, a scientist with the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa.
"Just to give you a visual idea if you were to visit the small
island, you would see hundreds and hundreds of dead carcasses of
eiders being picked clean by 400 herring gulls, so it's a gruesome
place right now."
Gilchrist says the disease started spreading about 2 years ago, but
they are not sure of its origin or how widespread it is. During 2005,
about 300 dead birds were found in the breeding areas around Hudson
Strait and northern Hudson Bay.
He says they are enlisting the help of local people in Coral Harbour,
Cape Dorset, Kimmirut and northern Quebec to keep track this summer.
"Certainly cholera as a disease, we consider rare in Nunavut so we
are concerned that it is growing," said Gilchrist, "and that there
are these outbreaks of it especially in northern Hudson Bay and in
Hudson Strait. We are working to monitor this, so we are working with
the communities to improve communication so that when outbreaks are
detected, they can be reported quickly to us."
Gilchrist says they hope to get a better picture of what's going on
by the end of the summer. He says avian cholera is not passed on to
humans and should not be mistaken for avian flu, but they're also
recommending people don't eat the birds if they suspect they are
diseased. He says they will be doing a final count of the dead birds
once those that are unaffected migrate south.

[To quote my colleague Tam Garland: "Avian cholera is caused by
_Pasteurella multocida_. There are several types or strains. The most
common type affecting wild birds is Type 1. In the wild, it affects
primarily ducks, coots, geese, gulls and crows. The causative agent
is contained in feces and other body secretions. Less acutely
affected birds may have a mucous discharge from the mouth, and there
may be blood; the vent is generally matted, and the droppings are
pasty with a tan to yellow color. Ingestion of food or water
contaminated with any infected body secretions will spread the
disease. Transmission by aerosol may occur, and the bacteria can
survive up to 4 months in the soil. Death is usually rapid, even to
the point of causing infected birds to fall out of the sky. Lethargy
and convulsions may occur in sick birds that do not die acutely.
Generally, cleanup of carcasses will help prevent contamination of
the environment."
We have not reported this from Canada before. Coral Harbour in on the
upper margin of Hudson Bay, and if you like cool weather and cloudy

Fowl cholera, sometimes referred to as avian cholera, is a common
cause of peracute, high-mortality events in wild birds, especially in
ducks and geese. Outbreaks have occurred in the United States,
primarily in the western U.S, as well as Canada and many other places
worldwide.
The United States Geological Service's National Wildlife Health
Center (USGS-NWHC) describes the clinical signs as follows: Large
die-offs are seen primarily in wild ducks and geese where the disease
affects birds peracutely. The sudden appearance of large numbers of
dead birds in good body condition with few if any sick birds is
observed. Death may be so rapid that birds literally fall out of the
sky or die while eating with no previous signs of disease. Sick birds
appear lethargic, and when captured may die within minutes. Other
signs include convulsions; swimming in circles; throwing the head
back between the wings; erratic flight, such as flying upside down or
trying to land a foot or more above the water; mucous discharge from
the mouth; soiling or matting of the feathers around the vent, eyes,
and bill; pasty, fawn-colored or yellow droppings; or blood-stained
droppings or nasal discharge. For more details about this disease in
wild birds,see USGS NWHC's
website
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_cholera/index.jsp>.
It is also historically one of the most important diseases in
commercial poultry. t is caused by the bacterium _Pasteurella
multocida_, so no one should confuse it with cholera in humans, which
is caused by another bacterium, _Vibrio chlorae_. Fowl cholera is
not zoonotic and has no public health significance.
It goes without saying that any wild bird die-off in the western
hemisphere should rule out avian influenza, and although there is
little information in this report that precludes avian influenza, one
can be fairly sure -- knowing Canadian animal health authorities --
that proper diagnostic samples have been taken and analyzed before
the "final count is taken when the birds move south", as indicated in
the last line of the report. - Mod.PC]
