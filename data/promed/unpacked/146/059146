BSE: POSSIBLE IN SHEEP

The European Commission is drawing up contingency plans to deal with the
possibility that sheep might be harbouring mad cow disease, or BSE (Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy), an internal paper showed on Thursday.
EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler has asked for elaborate contingency
plans should BSE in sheep be confirmed, the document obtained indicated.
The EU executive also intends to require all European Union farmers to
carry out stringent checks on their sheep and goats to ensure they are free
of BSE. The EU's decision to tighten controls follows a report earlier this
month from the British Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC)
which suggested the British government adopt new methods to determine
whether BSE was present in sheep.
But the Commission's decision to consider how it might act in the event of
BSE being found in sheep did not mean it had new evidence that sheep were
carrying the deadly disease, a spokesman for the EU executive said on
Thursday.
"We have no evidence that sheep can get BSE under farming conditions. Sheep
meat is, in general, an extensively produced, grass-based product," said
Gerry Kiely. "Nevertheless sheep can get scrapie and popular science holds
that BSE came from scrapie. We have to work on the precautionary basis that
it cannot be excluded that sheep can get BSE," he added.
More than 90 percent of sheep meat produced in the EU comes from lambs
under 12 months of age whereas BSE had a tradition of long incubation, he
said.
In September last year a British government adviser suggested there was a
theoretical risk that sheep could be infected with BSE and that it could be
passed to humans.
"I think there's a distinct possibility that BSE is out there in the sheep
population. If we found BSE in sheep, it would be a national emergency,"
Professor Jeffrey Almond said at the time. The British National Farmers'
Union played down Almond's comments, accusing him of scaremongering.
The outbreak of BSE in Britain was originally linked to the use of
high-protein cattle feed that included the remains of sheep infected with
scrapie, a form of BSE.
The EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports in 1996 following an
admission by the British government of a possible link between BSE and the
new variant form of the human brain disorder Creutzfeld-Jakobs Disease
(nvCJD).
EU farm ministers cleared British beef for export again in November last
year and EU officials now expect the ban to be finally lifted in the next
few months.
