Ethiopia. 4 suspected cases
--------------------------------------
Ethiopia's Ministry of Health on Sun [12 Oct 2014] disclosed establishing a modern laboratory center in a bid to control the deadly Ebola virus after 4 reported cases of EVD in Addis Ababa. The facility will start operating on Mon [13 Oct 2014] for testing of 4 suspected cases of Ebola. A disease that medical doctors believe is Ebola appears to be suspected in the Ethiopian capital. One western African origin diplomat has been admitted for flu-like symptoms in Saint Yared General Hospital; 3 more people have been also admitted to the Black Lion hospital, with reported cases of bleeding and fever. Doctors in Black Lion hospital, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue ... are saying it is Ebola.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified Ethiopia and Kenya as "high-risk" countries for the spread of the deadly ebolavirus. [A suspected Ebola case at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport ( JKIA) who died on arrival from Juba, South Sudan was reported to have tested negative for Ebola virus disease on 12 Oct 2014 (http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/article/2000137966/suspected-ebola-case-at-jkia-tests-negative). - Mod.ML] Ethiopia and Kenya are vulnerable because [they are] major transport hubs, with many flights from West Africa, a WHO official said. This is the most serious warning to date by the WHO that Ebola could spread to East Africa. The WHO's country director for Kenya, Custodia Mandlhate, said the East African states were "classified in group 2, at high risk of transmission."

The Ethiopian and Kenyan governments said that they would not ban flights from the 4 countries hit by Ebola. Ethiopia's and Kenya's national carriers are major airlines connecting countries across Africa and have on their part been pursuing the usual flights into West Africa. Bole international airport [Addis Ababa, Ethiopia] and Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) [Nairobi, Kenya] so far haven't any infrared thermometers or non-contact thermometers to measure body temperature of in-bound and out-bound passengers for possible Ebola symptoms.

2] USA: Texas 2nd nurse positive

...Even before the news conference at Presbyterian Hospital, a Dallas County hazardous materials team had decontaminated the public areas of the nurse's apartment complex in the M Streets off Lower Greenville Avenue and the parking lot at Presbyterian where she'd parked, along with her car. Officials sent a "reverse 911 call" to every telephone line within 4 blocks of the apartment, and police officers and others knocked on every door in the neighborhood to explain the situation and leave information about Ebola. "We had this plan in place last week," Rawlings said. "So when we got this phone call, which we thought we might get, we put an action team in place, and they have been working all this [prior] evening so that as people are waking up, they know that they are safe."

Arrangements were in the works to take care of the Presbyterian staffer's dog, which was in the apartment. By Sunday afternoon [12 Oct 2014], a decontamination team was working in the apartment. The speed of the response was in marked contrast to what happened after Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola. It took officials days to figure out how to clean the apartment where he'd been staying and to dispose of contaminated materials.

Rawlings and Dallas County Health Director Zachary Thompson were among several people walking the nurse's neighborhood, answering questions and distributing information. "You have to be honest with people," the mayor said. "If you are honest with them on the bad stuff, they will believe you about the good stuff."

The new case sets a new 21-day clock for watching for additional cases. People infected with Ebola can develop symptoms as long as 21 days after their 1st exposure. Only Presbyterian staffers were exposed to Duncan after he was hospitalized on 28 Sep 2014. The last day a Presbyterian staffer could have been exposed was when Duncan died last Wed [8 Oct 2014].

[There are some excellent graphics, including an interactive map of the infected countries in West Africa and a timeline for Texas.

The last day on which anyone who came into contact with Duncan will be monitored is 19 Oct 2014. The last day on which anyone who came into contact with the nurse will be monitored is 31 Oct 2014. - Mod.JW]

Two graduate student researchers at the Yale School of Public Health preparing to return from Liberia [in early October 2014] have agreed to sequester themselves for 3 weeks as a precautionary measure in case they have contracted Ebola.

"They were helping set up a computer system for the Liberian Ministry of Health to monitor the West African Ebola outbreak and track contact tracing, according to the email. "The email also noted that the students had no direct contact with Ebola patients and are currently asymptomatic. "...[YSPH Dean Paul] Cleary said the researchers' preventative measures against Ebola have even extended beyond what is required by the CDC or urged by YSPH. "The researchers volunteered to stay away from their office because of concerns raised by some staff; even though national guidelines do not suggest such an action," Cleary said. "I did not ask them to do that." ...

New Jersey health officials have ordered into mandatory quarantine an NBC News crew that worked with an American cameraman who contracted Ebola in Liberia, though the group has no symptoms, its health department said on Saturday [11 Oct 2014]. Freelance cameraman AM is receiving treatment at Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, which said on Fri [10 Oct 2014] that he had shown modest improvement and was in stable condition...

The NBC News crew had agreed with New Jersey health officials to sequester themselves upon return to the United States but then failed to do so, Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Health, said in a statement. The mandatory quarantine was issued late on Fri [10 Oct 2014] and will ensure the group remains confined until 22 Oct 2014, the end of a 21-day maximum incubation period for Ebola, Leusner said. "The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern [about] exposure to the community," she said. She declined to provide additional details about the crew, its size and what led to the mandatory order being issued, citing patient privacy.
