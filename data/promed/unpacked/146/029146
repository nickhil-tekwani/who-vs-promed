Update - Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Newport infection in England,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland: association with the consumption of
lettuce
--------------------------------------------
Since 9 Sep 2004, the Health Protection Agency Laboratory of Enteric
Pathogens has confirmed 368 cases of _S. enterica_ serovar Newport
infection in England and in Northern Ireland. Molecular typing
performed on 122 of the isolates show that 109 of the strains are
indistinguishable from each other and from 14 isolates confirmed by
the Scottish Salmonella Reference Laboratory since 13 Sep 2004.
At least 372 confirmed or suspected cases are being investigated
locally in northeast Lincolnshire (147), the West Midlands (95),
Northern Ireland (113), and the Isle of Man (17), with a small number
of cases occurring throughout other parts of England. All 14
confirmed cases are being investigated in Scotland. Most cases are
aged between 20 and 40 years. 33 hospital admissions (9 percent
admission rate) have been reported. Available onset dates (N=295)
range from 21 Aug to 25 Sep 2004 [for figure, see website]. Food
histories collected in England, the Isle of Man, and Northern Ireland
have commonly implicated fast-food premises and take-away restaurants
as a source of illness.
Case-control studies have been undertaken locally in north east
Lincolnshire, the West Midlands and in Northern Ireland to try to
identify the likely vehicle/vehicles of infection within fast-food
premises and take-away restaurants. In each, confirmed and suspected
cases of _S. enterica_ Newport infection, interviewed as part of the
study, were asked to identify controls who had eaten in
fast-food/take-away restaurants at the same time, but who had not
developed symptoms.
In north east Lincolnshire, studies focusing on 2 premises that
accounted for most of the cases found that the consumption of lettuce
(Odds Ratio [OR] 11.43; 95 percent Confidence Interval [CI]
1.86-70.27; P=0.009, and OR 12.8; 95 percent CI 3.34-49.12; P<0.001
respectively) was associated with being a case of Newport infection.
The case-control study undertaken in Northern Ireland has also shown
an association with lettuce (OR 5.95; 95 percent CI 1.6-22.2;
P=0.008). The case-control study in the West Midlands is ongoing.
Extensive environmental investigations have been carried out and are
continuing in an attempt to trace a common source.
