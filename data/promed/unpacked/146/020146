Those with Mesa County Public Health want to warn you of a local outbreak of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Getting vaccinated or even washing your hands, can keep you one step ahead of contracting pertussis. However, once the disease is caught, it can spread extremely easily.

"We've had 22 cases of pertussis reported in Mesa county since the beginning of November [2017]," said Andy Tyler, Regional Epidemiologist with Mesa County Public Health. During the same time period last year [2017], Mesa county had just one case of whooping cough.

For more information about what vaccination is best for you depending on your age, those with Mesa County Public Health say to give them a call at (970) 248-6900.

The Warao community of Bonoina, located in the Orinoco canals, in Delta Amacuro, reports an approximate of 10 whooping cough infections in children and adults. "It's a suffocating cough and the problem is that in dispensaries there are medicines," said Trino Ávila, a resident of the town.

Ávila pointed out that they have not yet been confirmed by the State in the absence of specialists the Orinoco Delta. His family is one of those affected by the recent illness. "I didn't know what to do, without medicines, far from the city, isolated in these rivers ...desperation takes over one," he lamented.

Ancestral knowledge came to pass and a wise Warao recommended that he bury a dry coconut filled with brown sugar and place a burning stove over it all night long. When unearthing it, there is a syrup, product of the mixture of both ingredients, and with that he cured his children.

[...]

A total of 25 000 Waraos live in the Antonio Díaz municipality of Delta Amacuro, hidden between canals, islands, and mangroves of the Orinoco River that flow into the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. They survive from agriculture and fisheries, in the absence of basic state services and now face an epidemic of whooping cough.
