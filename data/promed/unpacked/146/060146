Healthcare workers, including emergency room staff, are not routinely given
antibiotic prophylaxis for meningococcal meningitis. This is because they
are not considered to be at increased risk of acquiring disease simply by
virtue of their place of employment. It would be reasonable to conclude that
this group would be not be immunized for the same reasons. This is not to
say that these people might not be immunized as a part of another group
judged to be at risk. The single exception to this might be staff who would
be expected to have repeated true exposure such as by intubation of multiple
patients.
