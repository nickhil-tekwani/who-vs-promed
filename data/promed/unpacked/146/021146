[I am grateful for Dr. Nagaraj reminding us of that outbreak. While we
obtained an echo of it from the Times of India in August, further details
though requested were not forthcoming. For convenience I am copying here,
edited, all that we could obtain at the time. Anthrax, whether in livestock
or wildlife, in India is plainly a complex subject both politically and
epidemiologically. The thread is cut, at least for the time being. -Mod. MHJ
