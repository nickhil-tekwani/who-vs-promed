Four more cows died last weekend at the Hibma Dairy near Ballico,
California, USA, but state officials believe the worst part of the botulism
incidence that killed 140 animals is over.
"Some cows survived the botulism, but they are in a weakened condition and
are stressed," state Department of Agriculture spokesman Oscar Hidalgo
said. "Even as summer approaches others may die, not directly from the
botulism, but from symptoms related to the outbreak."
The remaining healthy cows at the dairy are being milked, and their milk is
being processed at high-heat into products such as butter and milk powder.
Richard Breitmeyer, state veterinarian and director of Animal Health and
Food Safety Services, said although laboratory tests remain inconclusive,
everything points to one large bale of hay as the source of the botulism.
"We are quite certain the hay is the source. How it came to be inside the
hay, we don't know," he said.
When several hundred cows died from botulism at the Genasci Brothers Dairy
in Modesto last year, the source was tracked to a cat carcass that had been
mixed in with the hay.
"We have had no such luck in this case," Breitmeyer said. "All the things
we've tested have come back negative for the botulism toxin."
He said it is likely all the suspect feed was consumed before state
scientists arrived at the dairy. Some rodent and bird bones were found in
the hay, but Breitmeyer said that is not unusual in large bales.
Breitmeyer said there has been some speculation that big, tightly packed
bales of hay can provide an environment for botulism, even without the
presence of an animal carcass.
"But we must be careful not to jump to some assumption," Breitmeyer said.
"I think we really need to get some research, and one of our goals is to
take a hard look at this."
Organizers are now trying to help make sure the dairy can start accepting
some donations of animals, Hidalgo said. Joe Ramos, a field representative
with Western United Dairymen, said the association is sending a statewide
mailer to all Grade A dairies informing them about the Hibmas' situation.
Western United Dairymen is collecting the names of people interested in
donating animals to the dairy. People wishing to donate money are asked to
make checks payable to the Hibma Dairy Trust Fund, and send the checks to
Western United Dairymen, 1315 K St., Modesto, California, USA 95354.
