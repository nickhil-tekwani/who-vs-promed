[This is a puzzler. Anthrax is less than sporadic in Slovenia. The only records I have are for 2 adjoining farms in NE Slovenia, which involved the sale of contaminated fodder, and single outbreaks in 2001 and 1992. As this is not the time of year that fodder is purchased and fed to stock, one is left with the possibility that some trench digging disturbed an old cattle grave which deposited spores on the surface. With 7 animals affected and dying, the farmer was either careless and ignorant of what was happening, such that it got away from him and his veterinarian, or that it was a badly contaminated batch of dairy meal containing bone meal with anthrax spores, or both circumstances. But in my experience, if it were contaminated bone meal, a number of herds in the area where it was sold would also have been affected more or less at the same time.

As they have a PCR capacity, it should be possible to identify the genomic strain involved in this outbreak, and therefore determine where it came from. - Mod.MHJ
