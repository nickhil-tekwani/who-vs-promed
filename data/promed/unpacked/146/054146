When you review the 1996 WHO disease prevalence rate reports, you will see
that more reported deaths are due to rabies than to dengue fever, polio,
meningococcal meningitis or Japanese encephalitis! Keep this disease in
mind when people come back from canine rabies endemic regions in particular.

[Henry's point is well taken given the 60,000 human deaths rabies deaths
WHO reported in it's 1996 world health summary. In a previous posting on
dengue in Cambodia (Dengue - Cambodia 980215171005), moderator CHC points
out the fact that ProMED-mail is currently following outbreaks in 30
countries worldwide. According to CDC, dengue fever affect 10 million
people annually with the more severe dengue hemorrhagic fever affecting
100,000 people. One can expect a case fatality rate of 5% in DHF. Thus, we
must always distinguish morbidity and mortality, each have their
implications, except in rare situations like rabies in which morbidity and
mortality are essentially the same. - Mod.PC
