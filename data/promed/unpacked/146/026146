The authorities said they have discovered a new case of bird flu at a
chicken farm near Tokyo, prompting health officials to order the culling of
some 100 000 chickens.
The farm is in Ishioka, 80 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, and keeps 1.11
million chickens in 12 houses, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries said in a statement.
It was 1 of 3 farms which supply chickens to another farm which was found
last Thursday [18 Aug 2005] to have been hit by bird flu.
The local health office is to kill all 100 000 chickens in the house where
the virus of the H5 strain of bird flu was found.
Japan has been relatively free of bird flu, which has killed 61 people in
Southeast Asia since 2003, with 13 cases [in poultry in Japan] reported so
far, an official of the ministry said.
There were 4 outbreaks in Japan in 2004, the first cases in the country
since 1925.
