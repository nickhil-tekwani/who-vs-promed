In Chitwan district, spread of an unidentified disease among the banana trees has made farmers anxious. They claim that the disease 1st attacks leaves, spreads to the seed, and then to the entire tree.

"Though it's not the dry season, banana trees have gone totally dry due to the disease. We don't know what kind of disease it is," said a farmer. In his 11-years of banana farming, he has not seen such disease. "This disease has shocked me. Even the experts from the agricultural department have not been able to say anything about it," he said.

Farmers are extremely worried over the new problem. Another farmer stated that the disease has spread in the entire district. "So far, no one has been able to figure this out." There will be huge loss in banana production if the problem is not addressed soon.

[A number of banana pathogens have been reported from the region, including, for example, _Banana bunchy top virus_, as well as the fungal diseases of black and yellow sigatoka (_Mycosphaerella_ species) and Panama disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_), including tropical race 4 (TR4). (For more information, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

Symptoms described above are not sufficient to speculate on the disease or disorder referred to. Reliable diagnosis is urgently required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
