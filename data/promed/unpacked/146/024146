2003/106 European tomato isolates belong to a distinct strain of pepino
mosaic potexvirus
-------------------------------------------------------------
In 1999, a new virus disease of tomato was found in protected tomato crops
in the Netherlands and then in other European countries. Preliminary
studies revealed the presence of pepino mosaic potexvirus (PepMV - EPPO
alert list), a virus which was originally described from pepino (_Solanum
muricatum_) in Peru (found in 2 tomato crops in 1974 and then no longer
observed).
The virus was purified, and an antiserum was produced that reacted strongly
with the isolates from tomato and the type isolate from pepino. Various
diagnostic tests indicated that PepMV differed from all other known
potexviruses reported from solanaceous crops (potato aucuba mosaic virus
and potato virus X). The type isolate from pepino in Peru and 3 others from
tomato collected in the Netherlands, Germany, and United Kingdom were
further studied.
Serological tests (IEM, DAS-ELISA) could not differentiate between them.
Molecular tests confirmed the results of host range and symptomatological
studies (mechanical inoculation) that tomato PepMV isolates differed from
the pepino isolate. Pepino mosaic potexvirus is considered the causal agent
of the new disease observed in tomatoes in Europe, and that European tomato
isolates differ from the type strain found on pepino. The authors
designated the new strain as the tomato strain of PepMV.

[According to Van der Vlugt, pepino mosaic is still present in glasshouse
production systems in the Netherlands, but is under control and is not a
serious problem. Whether it is present in outside production systems is
unknown; but if it is present, it will probably be in home gardens. In
addition to the Netherlands, the disease has been reported from Germany,
UK, Belgium, France, and Spain. In most of these countries it is under
control or has been eradicated. Unfortunately, pepino mosaic is present in
outdoor tomato production areas in Spain, where it causes serious crop loss
in localized areas. Results of studies (symptoms on plant indicator hosts
and percent homology in a 547-bp PCR fragment derived from the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) all of 15 PepMV isolates from countries
within Europe and elsewhere are considered members of the same strain,
designated as the tomato strain of PepMV. Moreover, the high similarity
between the various isolates suggests that the outbreaks in Europe likely
originated from a common locus. The prevailing assumption is that PepMV was
brought to Europe from South America by unknown means.
Pepino mosaic is difficult to manage. Disease management in glasshouse
production systems requires strict application of phytosanitary measures
(use of virus-free seed and transplants, sterilization of equipment and
facilities, and disinfection of circulated irrigation water).
