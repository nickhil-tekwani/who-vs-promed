In the fight against fungicide resistance in the damaging barley
disease, powdery mildew, hundreds of samples of the disease are needed
from South Australia (SA) and Western Australia (WA) for a Grains
Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) funded survey.

Richard Oliver, Australian Research Centre for Necrotrophic Fungal
Pathogens, said the samples would reveal fungicide resistance
patterns, and help breeders produce new barley varieties resistant to
powdery mildew.

The survey follows confirmation last year [2010] of triazole
resistance in barley powdery mildew, Australia's 1st case of a
broadacre [Australian term used to describe farms or industries
engaged in the production of crops or the grazing of livestock on a
large scale] crop pathogen resistant to a fungicide.

Professor Oliver said the survey would help fine-tune advice to
growers on which fungicides were still effective. "The survey will
also provide information about different virulence genes expressed by
the pathogen," he said. "This will guide plant breeders' selection of
resistance genes [of the host] which could result in new barley
varieties with improved resistance within the next 2 to 5 years."

Powdery mildew causes annual losses of [about USD 39 million] to
Australia's barley crops, with most losses incurred in Western
Australia. Oliver said growers could protect crops and limit the
spread of resistant strains by controlling barley volunteers, growing
barley varieties resistant to the disease, and using effective
fungicides.

[Powdery mildew caused by the fungus _Blumeria graminis_ f. sp.
_hordei_ is one of the major diseases of barley. It affects leaves,
stems, and ears of both winter and spring varieties. Symptoms are most
common on leaves and include a white fluffy growth, chlorosis and loss
of photosynthetic ability reducing plant vigour and seed production.
Masses of spores are produced leading to a 'powdery' appearance. High
levels of disease at an early growth stage can kill out tillers. Many
varieties show adult resistance and therefore disease levels are
generally lower later in the season.

The fungus survives between seasons primarily as mycelium on
volunteer barley plants and in cold regions on autumn-sown crops.
Spores are spread by wind, water, and mechanical means. Management
strategies include cultural practices to reduce inoculum (burying
stubble, crop rotation, control of volunteer barley), fungicides, use
of clean seed, and use of resistant barley varieties.

In 2010, an outbreak of powdery mildew was reported on barley in WA
(ProMED-mail post 20100527.1758), and a new pathogen strain has now
been associated with it.
