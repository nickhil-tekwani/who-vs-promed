The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [Mon 6 Nov 2017] investigating an outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) in a primary school in Sheung Shui, and again urged the public, schools and institutions to maintain strict hand, personal and environmental hygiene.

The 19 affected pupils, 11 boys and 8 girls aged 7 -- 11, and one staff member have developed fever, rashes over hands and feet, and oral ulcers from [Wed 4 Oct - Fri 3 Nov 2017]. Among them, 18 sought medical attention and none required hospitalisation. All affected persons have been in stable condition.

The stool specimen of one affected pupil tested positive for enterovirus upon laboratory testing.

Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit to the school and advised the management on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The school has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.

"HFMD is common in children while adult cases may also appear. It is usually caused by enteroviruses (EVs) such as Coxsackie virus and EV71.

It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rashes or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet," a spokesman for the CHP said.

To prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:

- Maintain good air circulation;
- Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
- Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;
- Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently with diluted household bleach (by adding one part of household bleach containing 5.25 percent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;
- Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted;
- Avoid going to overcrowded places; and
- Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest situation of the sick children.

["Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood illness caused by serotypes of the _Enterovirus A_ species in the genus _Enterovirus_ of the Picornaviridae family. The disease has had a substantial burden throughout East and Southeast Asia over the past 15 years. China reported 9 million cases of HFMD between 2008 and 2013, with the 2 serotypes Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) being responsible for the majority of these cases. Three recent phase 3 clinical trials showed that inactivated monovalent EV-A71 vaccines manufactured in China were highly efficacious against HFMD associated with EV-A71, but offered no protection against HFMD caused by CV-A16." (S Takahash et al. 2016. Hand-foot-mouth Disease in China: Modeling Epidemic Dynamics of Enterovirus Serotypes and Implications for Vaccination. PLoS Medicine https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001958)

Vaccination may be a good approach to reducing the incidence of HFMD in the country.

The Ministry of Health confirmed 98 cases of children with the virus "Hand, foot, and mouth" in the Los Lagos region. They ruled out that there is an outbreak in the area.

Up to 33 cases in Puerto Montt, 26 in Calbuco and 19 in Hualaihue are some of the communes where more cases have been found.

The disease is highly contagious and has fever symptoms, decay, blisters on the hands, feet and mouth ulcers.

The Health Seremi Eugenia Schnacke, ruled out an outbreak in the region, calling family and kindergartens to raise hygienic standards.

The regional secretary pointed out that parents should be alert to symptoms, explaining that when a child has a fever over 38 C [100.4 F], they should be moved to a health center.
