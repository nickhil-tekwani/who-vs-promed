First Report of Soybean Rust (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_) in Nigeria. O. A.

PLANT DISEASE: 97, 2001; published on-line as D-2000-as D-2000-1030-01N,
2000. Accepted for publication 5 Oct 2000.
Rust caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ H. & P. Sydow was observed for the
first time on soybean (_Glycine max_ [L.] Merr.) in Nigeria during the 1999
main soybean growing season. The disease was first noticed on soybean farms
in Oniyo and neighboring villages located about 20 km west of Ogbomoso
(Long. 4 degrees 02 min E and Lat. 8 degrees 06 min N), Oyo State, Nigeria.
The area falls under the moist savanna vegetation with a bimodal rainfall
pattern (from April to July, September to November) and an annual mean
rainfall of 1370 mm. Commercial cultivation of soybean by farmers in the
area started in 1986. A similar disease outbreak in 1999 on soybean in
Benue state, the major area of soybean production in Nigeria, could not be
confirmed to be rust.
In the Oniyo area, soybean is commonly grown as an early season crop
usually planted between March and April in small plots to produce seeds for
the main crop, normally planted in July. Rust was not observed on the early
season soybean crop grown in the area in 1999. Symptoms were first observed
on leaves close to the ground in September 1999 as chlorotic spots, which
progressed to reddish brown lesions, then uredia. The symptoms appeared
further up the plant until all the leaves were infected. Pimple-like uredia
observed in the lesions were more pronounced and numerous on the lower
surface of the leaves than on the upper leaf surface. Uredia were noted to
cluster together in clumps (1). The urediospores released from a central
ostiole in the uredia were hyaline and oblong, 17 micrometers wide (15 to
18 micrometers) and 22 micrometers long (19 to 25 micrometers).
Premature defoliation occurred on infected plants. Seed weight of
[cultivars] TGX 1485-1D, TGX 1448-2E, and TGX 1440-1E was reduced by 28,
52, and 49%, respectively. Disease severity was higher on the medium
maturing cultivars and all those that were planted late.

[Intensive screening of soybean cultivars for resistance to the pathogen is
been done at laboratories in Chiangmai Field Crop Research Center
(Thailand) and at the Rattray Arnold Research Station in Harare (Zimbabwe).
The TGx cultivars referred to above are newly developed African soybean
cultivars known as Tropical Glycine cross (TGx). These cultivars are
nodulated by bradyrhizobia indigenous to African soils, and are designated
as _Brachyrhizobium_ spp. These species can be classified into effective
and ineffective types based on their symbiotic performance on TGx soybean.
Soybean cultivars Samsoy 2, TGx 1448-2E and TGx 1485-1D are recommended for
planting in Nigeria. - Mod.DH]
