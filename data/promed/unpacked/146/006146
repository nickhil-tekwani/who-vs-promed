The Nebraska Department of Agriculture has confirmed 12 cases of a fatal equine disease. According to the department, equine infectious anemia [EIA] was found in one horse herd in northwestern Nebraska.

State Veterinarian Dr Dennis Hughes says EIA only affects horses, mules, and donkeys and is usually fatal. Other animals and humans are unable to become infected with this disease.

Hughes says there are no treatment options currently available for infected horses.

Signs of EIA include: fever, depression, weight loss, swelling, and anemia. Producers with horses, donkeys, or mules that exhibit these signs are urged to contact their veterinarian immediately.

EIA is a blood borne disease that is typically transmitted by biting insects such as horseflies and deer flies, in addition to transmission through infected needles.

Horse owners are being encouraged to take biosecurity precautions to reduce the risk of infection in their herd. Such precautions include implementing control measures such as husbandry practices that reduce biting insects, not sharing needles between horses, and giving a Coggins test before allowing equine intermingling.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) is a contagious, viral disease affecting all members of the equine species, including horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules. Once animals become infected, they are life-long carriers of the virus.

There are 3 clinical forms of EIA: acute, chronic, and inapparent. The majority of the clinical signs of the disease are related to the reaction of the animal's immune system to the viral infection.

Clinical signs of the acute form include high fever, depression, loss of appetite, small areas of hemorrhaging on the mucous membranes, stocking up (swelling of the legs), and edema (collection of fluid) along the ventral abdomen. Clinical signs of the acute form of the virus usually appear 7 to 30 days after exposure to (or infection with) the virus.

Clinical signs of the chronic form of EIA include reoccurring intermittent fever, depression, lack or loss of appetite, weight loss, anemia, weakness, and incoordination of the hind legs. The severity and frequency of the reoccurring episodes decrease over time. Animals that are infected without showing detectable clinical signs are "inapparent carriers" of EIA. Mares that are infected with EIA typically fail to conceive or abort if they are pregnant.

EIA is found in the blood of all infected animals even if they are inapparent carriers. Typically, equines with the acute form of the disease are more infectious than others carrying the virus because of the high levels of virus circulating in the blood. The primary method of transmission is through blood sucking insects, including horse flies, deer flies, mosquitoes, and gnats. Less common modes of transmission are virally contaminated instruments such as needles, syringes, and dental and teeth floating equipment. Transmission may also occur between infected pregnant mares and unborn foals. About 10 per cent of foals born to infected mares are infected with the virus. The virus may also be transmitted through natural service or breeding.

There are several preventive management measures equine owners can take to decrease the risk of their animals contacting the disease. One important measure is the establishment of an effective fly control program. Blood sucking insects are the primary transmitters of EIA, so decreasing the presence of these pests can decrease the risk of equine animals getting the disease. Effective fly control programs can include foggers, fly repellants, and electronic or automatic fly control systems in barns. Perhaps the easiest and most cost effective method of fly control is the removal and spreading of manure and generally keeping barns and other areas clean.

Another preventive measure is sterilizing and disinfecting all animal health equipment. Use syringes and needles on only one animal. Follow the rule of thumb: "One horse, one syringe, one needle." Be sure that surgical, dental, and tattooing equipment is sterilized and disinfected after each use.

Require all equines entering the premises to have a negative EIA test within the past 12 months and test all horses annually for EIA.

It is imperative to remember that infected animals are lifelong carriers of EIA. Currently, there are no effective treatments for the disease. Likewise, there are no vaccines available in North America for prevention or protection from EIA.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has thoughtfully provided an educational brochure on EIA to owners, to state authorities, and to all of us it is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/animal_diseases/eia/downloads/eia-1996.pdf.
