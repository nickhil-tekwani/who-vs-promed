Vibrio vulnificus: Not a pearl you want to find!
To be broadcast via satellite on February 26, 1999 2:00-4:00pm Eastern Time

Program Description:
-------------------------
This interactive satellite program will address _Vibrio vulnificus_, an opportunistic pathogen that is a
natural contaminant of shellfish. The organism, which affects persons with pre-existing chronic disease,
is lethal in 50% of cases, within 36 hours of infection. Currently, the biggest challenge in understanding
the disease is to determine the infectious dose and specific markers that may distinguish susceptible
individuals. Core to this issue is the need for researchers and public health laboratories to learn of the
infection within hours of the diagnosis. This allows for suspected oysters to be traced, and the strain
enumerated in the food. Secondly, it allows for analysis of infected persons to investigate markers of
susceptibility.
Objectives:
At the conclusion of the program participants will be able to:
Summarize the disease process resulting from an infection caused by _V. vulnificus_.
· Discuss the epidemiology of _V. vulnificus_ disease.
· Outline the Current research efforts regarding control and treatment of _V.vulnificus_
disease.
· Describe improved methods for isolation and detection of _V. vulnificus_.
· Describe the function of a Laboratory Network in the control of _V. vulnificus_ disease.
Faculty will include:
· Ron Baker, Biological Administrator, Florida Department of Health, Bureau of
Laboratories, Jacksonville, FL
· Paul Gulig, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Department of Molecular Genetics and
Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL
· Roberta Hammond, Biological Administrator, Florida Department of Health Tallahassee, FL
· Mark Tamplin, Ph.D., Project Director, Associate Professor, Department of Family,
Youth and Community Sciences, Institute of Food & Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida,
Gainesville, FL
Who should attend:
This satellite seminar is designed to provide information which will be beneficial to clinical
laboratorians, microbiologists, epidemiologists, and public health employees.
Continuing Education Credit (CEU)
This program has been structured following the International Association for Continuing Education and
Training (IACET) Criteria and Guidelines and therefore is awarding Continuing Education Units
(CEUs). The National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN), in joint sponsorship with the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will award 0.2 CEUs to each participant who successfully
completes this program. The CEU is a nationally recognized unit designed to provide a record of an
individual's continuing education accomplishments.
This course is approved for 2 contact hours in the category of Microbiology for Florida Laboratory
Licensees.
Sponsored by: National Laboratory Training Network and University of Florida - Institute of Food &
Agricultural Sciences

Registration:
The registration fee for this course is $15.00 per individual. Registered participants will be provided
with a passcode to access the course handouts. To view the course handouts you will need Adobe
Acrobat Reader which can be downloaded free at: www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/read
