[It appears as if the proverbial wires got crossed for these 2 postings.
The 1st was dated 9 Dec 2005 and declares a final report ending the event.
The 2nd report is 2 days earlier, 7 Dec 2005, and indicates a reoccurrence
and new outbreak of the disease. The 2 outbreaks near Bursa (Sea of Marmara
) and Ankara, respectively, are quite distant from each other and probably
represent 2 distinct events. See map:
