[2] South America (Argentina): alert

Today [Fri 20 Jul 2018], the Argentine Ministry of Health released an epidemiological alert in which they confirmed that there had been at least 2 reported cases of measles in babies in Argentina. The report went on to urge people to take a number of "control measures" to protect themselves and their children from the outbreak.

The official statement released by the Ministry of Health stated: "Yesterday [Thu 19 Jul 2018], we confirmed 2 cases of measles in Buenos Aires. In view of this situation and the overall epidemiological context, the Ministry of Health of the Nation urges local health teams to verify the vaccination status of the population, sensitize the epidemiological surveillance of the febrile exanthematic disease, and respond quickly and adequately to identify any possible cases".

The reported cases both involved babies who had not been vaccinated against measles yet because of their young age. The 1st was a 5-month-old boy from the City of Buenos Aires, who began showing symptoms on [Thu 12 Jul 2018]. The 2nd was a 6-month old girl from the Province of Buenos Aires, diagnosed the next day [Fri 13 Jul 2018].

"Both cases presented similar symptoms (fever, rash, cough, and conjunctivitis)," stated Argentina's Minister of Health, Adolfo Rubinstein. "...both cases were confirmed by IgM serology and viral genome detection by PCR in a urine and respiratory sample."
In response to the outbreak, Rubinstein issued an order for the Ministry of Health to control the area in which the measles cases occurred, and conduct a full investigation to determine the source of the infection.

A few weeks ago, there were reported cases of measles in Russia, and warnings were issued to those traveling to the country for the 2018 World Cup. One hypothesis put forward by speculators is that one of the babies could have come into contact with someone who brought back the disease from abroad.

Meanwhile, in an interview with Clarin, Carla Vizzotti, President of the Argentine Society of Vaccinology and Epidemiology (SAVE), explained: "They are 2 babies who did not travel, who were not vaccinated because they were not old enough to be vaccinated. We are investigating whether they had contact with someone who traveled. The outbreak was confirmed yesterday [Thu 19 Jul 2018] and we are now investigating the places where they went, the possible places where they came in contact with the disease."

While the case of the 5-month-old in the city of Buenos Aires is still a mystery, in the case of the 6-month-old in the province, preliminary investigations have concluded that she caught the disease after coming into contact with a 21-year-old unvaccinated man who had contracted measles during a trip to Thailand

Measles continues to spread to indigenous communities. The regional director of health of Amazonas, Jesus Bernabe Yuriyuri, confirmed that there are 7 cases of the disease in indigenous people of the Yanomami ethnic group in the Alto Orinoco municipality. The official indicated that the records correspond to the samples taken in the communities of Oroshi and Irotha since last April [2018].

However, in declarations offered this [Mon 16 Jul 2018], Yuriyuri did not refer to the denunciations of deaths that have been made by NGOs in charge of protecting indigenous rights.

The director reported that "in the next few hours" air support is expected to make the transfer to the communities and confirm the reports of deaths from the virus.

The Kape Kape Civil Association reported that it has received warnings about a possible outbreak in the community Irotatheri, 19 kilometers [11.8 miles approx.] from the border with Brazil , and on deaths of "a considerable number" of people who had symptoms of measles , such as high fever, difficulty Respiratory and convulsions.

Brazilian authorities from the border state of Roraima register 412 cases of measles in the state, of which only 200 have been confirmed. By [Wed May 30 2018], he indicates, 57 were of Venezuelan origin and 34 came from indigenous communities.

The Yanomami are not the only ethnic group that has been affected by the re-emergence of measles in the national territory. In April of this year [2018] the Kape Kape civil association denounced the death of at least 12 children of the Warao community in the Delta Amacurostate.

Subsequently, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) confirmed in a bulletin the death of 33 indigenous people of the Warao ethnic group and the import of cases to Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador.

PAHO reported in a report dated June 2018 that the epidemic of measles has spread to 21 states of Venezuela and the District Capital. At that time, it registered 2285 confirmed cases, of which more than half occurred so far in 2018.

It also indicates that Brazil registers an outbreak of measles in progress, with a total of 995 reported cases. Up to 611 of them are concentrated in the state of Amazonas and another 384 in the state of Roraima , the 2 entities closest to the border with Venezuela.

In June of this year [2018] the regional body reported that 114 cases had been confirmed to date and that the disease left 2 deaths in the neighboring country.

Among the reasons for the spread of the virus, PAHO lists the low vaccination coverage, the lack of an adequate surveillance system, the delay in the application of measures to control the disease, the poor ability to isolate patients and an intense movement at borders with neighboring countries during the period of incubation or transmission of the virus.

Cook County Department of Public Health officials are reporting a confirmed case of measles in a Cook County resident who recently traveled to another country with ongoing measles transmission and no prior immunity to measles.

The resident also visited a restaurant and grocery store in the area earlier this month [July 2018].

[See URL above for locations visited by infected individual.] Anyone who visited those locations during that timeframe who is experiencing symptoms of measles should call their health care provider and contact their local health department, officials say. Symptoms, which can develop up to 21 days after exposure, include rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes.

Officials are working with both establishments to contact employees who were present during potential exposure times. There is no ongoing risk of transmission at either location. ...-more

[5] Taiwan alert

A measles case has raised the total for the year to 30, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday [Sat 21 Jul 2018], calling on the public to take precautions.

A woman in her 20s living in northern Taiwan developed a cough, a sore throat, fever and facial rash on [Fri 13 Jul 2018] last week, the CDC said in a news release.

The woman consulted a doctor on [Wed 18 and Thu 19 Jul 2018], but her symptoms did not improve.

Doctors yesterday [Sat 21 Jul 2018] confirmed that she had contracted measles and reported the case to the centers, the CDC said, adding that she has been quarantined at her home.

The center said it has identified 72 people who had contact with her over the past few weeks at her workplace, hospitals and in the community where she lives, but did not find anyone else infected.

It is to track the health of those people until [Mon 6 Aug 2018], the CDC said.

The woman had not traveled overseas recently, but her neighbor contracted the disease in Indonesia last month [June 2018], CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said.

However, if the neighbor passed the disease to the woman last month [June 2018], it is almost impossible that symptoms did not arise until this month [July 2018], Lo said, adding that the centers did not rule out that she contracted the disease indirectly.

A total of 30 cases of measles have been reported in Taiwan this year [2018] -- a 7-year record -- including 18 cases of domestic contagion and 12 cases resulting from travel abroad, mostly in Southeast Asian countries, such as Thailand, the centers said.

Highly contagious, the measles virus spreads through the air and could be transmitted among passengers on public transport, Lo said.

Once infected, a patient might begin to cough or have a runny nose and fever after 1 or 2 weeks, which could develop into more serious complications, such as pneumonia or encephalitis, he said.

The best way to prevent infection is to get the 3 - in -1 vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, he said, adding that parents should have their children vaccinated after they turn 1 year old and that adults between 20 and 40 without complete vaccination should be vigilant.

[Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. Also, measles virus can live for up to 2 hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.
Infected people can spread measles to others from 4 days before through 4 days after the rash appears. (https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/transmission.html)]

The World Health Organization (WHO) says 3 people have died while 453 cases of measles have been confirmed since the latest outbreak hit Mauritius late in March [2018].

According to the WHO African weekly outbreaks bulletin for the week ending 20 Jul, Mauritius has reported measles cases since 21 Mar [2018]. Infections peaked in the week ending 18 Jun, with more than 80 cases confirmed. All came from 9 districts, while the case fatality ratio averaged 0.7 percent.

"The 3 deaths have been in young women with unknown vaccination status, all between the ages of 29 and 31 years. All were immuno-deficient, resulting in the disease being complicated by encephalitis or septicaemia.

"The incidence rate was highest in those aged 0--9 years of age, followed by those aged 20--39 years. The incidence rate of the disease was highest in the districts located in the west of the island including Port Louis, Black River and Plaines Wilhems," the WHO said.

The confirmed cases were notified to the Communicable Disease Control Unit (CDCU) in the Mauritian capital Port Louis. The government has concluded a case analysis which found that 45 percent of the infected people were never vaccinated for measles.

Only 29 percent have previously received at least one dose of some measles-containing vaccine (MCV1), while 26 percent are of unknown vaccination status. Most of the patients are being isolated at home and a public call has been made to limit travels to avoid spreading the disease.

A total of 10 health teams are operating across the island, screening for fever/rash and checking public vaccination status for MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) in all schools in the affected areas.

The WHO said the current outbreak of measles in Mauritius demonstrates the importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination coverage against the disease.

"Prior to this current outbreak, the last detected case of measles in Mauritius was in 2009 and the country consistently had one of the highest (measles) vaccination rates in the WHO African region.

However, the vaccination coverage dropped in the past 2 years, leading to the current outbreak. Supplementary immunisation activities are being planned to halt the spread of the disease.
