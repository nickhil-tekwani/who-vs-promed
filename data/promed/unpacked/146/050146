In order to combat the outbreak of a deadly porcine disease, 5000
pigs from small farms in Caledon, Worcester, and Malmesbury will have
to be culled during the next few weeks. But consumers won't have to
cross bacon off their shopping lists: the Cape Pork Producers
Association says that while the disease poses "no risk whatsoever" to
humans, the meat from infected pigs will still not be made
commercially available.
The provincial department of agriculture said an outbreak of porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome [PRRS] (more commonly known as
blue ear disease) was 1st detected at a farm in Klapmuts about 2
weeks ago. The veterinary services unit had been monitoring the
situation, said Agriculture MEC (Member of the Executive Council)
Cobus Dowry's spokesperson, Alie van Jaarsveld.
Van Jaarsveld said Dowry had met the Pork Producers Association on
Tuesday [28 Aug 2007] to discuss a way forward. Pigs on about 13
farms were being tested for the disease, and results were expected
from the state vet soon. "We're not sure of the specific strain (of
the disease), and we don't want to guess at it," said Van Jaarsveld.
Mike Heramb, chairperson of the Cape Pork Producers Association, said
his organisation had met an abattoir to discuss the culling of the
pigs, which he hoped would start by the end of next week [3-9 Sep
2007]. "We're in the process of getting the whole thing on track,"
said Heramb. He said the disease was not necessarily fatal to pigs,
but that it was devastating for pig farmers, because it affected
sows' reproductive systems. "This is our 3rd attempt to curb this
disease," said Heramb. "We haven't seen any sign of it for nearly 2
years." He confirmed that the last outbreak had occurred in the same
areas of the Western Cape [see ProMED 2004 archive below. -

because they purchased animals that were tested regularly for
disease. "Small farmers buy whatever they can find. All the affected
farms were "linked somehow", he said, as they bought and sold pigs to
each other. He said a permit system, implemented 2 years ago, had
enabled the association to track the infected pigs. The permit system
was put in place after an outbreak of blue ear disease in
Drakenstein, Klapmuts, Philippi, Emfuleni, and Malmesbury. All
movements of pigs into and out of those areas required a "red" permit
issued by the state vet's Boland or Malmesbury offices.
The virus that causes blue ear disease was transmitted "from pig to
pig", said Heramb. "We want to eliminate the disease." He said
vaccinating pigs against blue ear disease was "very expensive", and
that emerging farmers could not afford to vaccinate their
animals. Pigs would be culled and their remains destroyed, said
Heramb. "These pigs won't go on to the market."
