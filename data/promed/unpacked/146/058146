Following the notification on 3 Jan 2013 of a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Niger, outbreak response is continuing in the country. A WPV1 case had been detected from Tahoua region, with onset of paralysis on 15 Nov 2012 (the 1st case in the country since December 2011). Genetic sequencing confirmed that the virus was a new importation into Niger, most closely related to virus circulating in Kaduna state, Nigeria.

The Government of Niger is continuing to implement a comprehensive response in line with international outbreak response guidelines issued by the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Resolution WHA59.1. Following an initial supplementary immunization activity (SIA) on 15 Jan 2013 to reach approximately 2 million children with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV), nationwide SIAs were conducted from 2-5 Feb 2013, targeting more than 5 million children with trivalent OPV. A 2nd nationwide SIA is planned for 2-5 Mar [2013] with bivalent OPV. Previously, nationwide SIAs had been conducted on [23 Nov 2012] with bivalent OPV. A joint national and international team of epidemiologists and public health experts has been deployed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) Regional Office for Africa to assist the Government of Niger in the investigations, help plan response activities and support active searches for additional cases of paralytic polio.

This event confirms the risk of ongoing international spread of a pathogen (WPV) slated for eradication. In May 2012, the completion of polio eradication was declared a programmatic emergency for global public health by the WHA in Resolution WHA65.5. Given the history of international spread of polio from northern Nigeria across West Africa, WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from Nigeria as high. Based on the history of previous importations to Niger and the ongoing response, the WHO assesses the risk of further international spread from Niger as moderate to high. This risk is currently magnified by large-scale population movements across the region associated with insecurity in Mali. To minimize this risk, multi-country synchronized SIAs are planned across 13 countries of west Africa in late April and late May [2013], using a combination of bivalent and trivalent OPV.

Due to the persistence of sub-national surveillance gaps in some areas of West Africa, undetected further circulation cannot be ruled out at this time. Investigations are ongoing to more clearly identify surveillance gaps in the region, including among mobile, migrant and underserved populations. Measures are being implemented to strengthen sub-national surveillance, to ensure that all groups and areas, particularly high-risk populations, are covered by high-quality surveillance.

As per recommendations outlined in WHO's International travel and health, travellers to and from Niger, and other polio-affected countries, should be fully protected by vaccination. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-infected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyse routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high-risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 coverage is<80 percent.

[ProMED-mail apologizes for the delay in posting this report. The significance of identification of a case of polio caused by infection with a wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) genetically related to WPV1 known to be circulating in Kaduna, Nigeria is unfortunate proof of the concerns re: continued spread of WPV to countries where WPV transmission had been interrupted related to the continued circulation of WPV in Nigeria. As can be seen in the next report below this one, WPV circulation in Nigeria is continuing, and areas within the country as well as in other countries are at risk of re-introduction of the WPV.

[2] Nigeria - outbreak in FCT
Date: Thu 21 Feb 2013

FCT [Federal Capital Territory] records fresh outbreak of type one wild polio
----------------
Three months after a reported case of wild polio in Jahi village, a community in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC), another case has been confirmed in Kabusa, Lugbe, FCT, an official said.

Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed, the Executive Secretary of the FCT Primary Health Care Development Board, said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday [21 Feb 2013] in Abuja, that the case of 2 and 1/2-year old male was reported to the board 2 weeks ago during the immunisation plus days.

Mohammed told NAN that [the child] had a case weakness of the limbs and samples were taken to Ibadan for test, a confirmation of the result was out on [18 Feb 2013].

"In December [2012], we had the 1st case of polio positive and the 2nd case was also positive, so we have 3 cases in 3 months. That means we need to do more so as to curtail the transmission of polio in the FCT, so that it doesn't move to other states. 2 weeks ago, when we were doing our immunisation, the child was reported to have weakness of the limbs. The 1st thing that we do when we have a child that has reported with the weakness of the limbs is to take the stool sample for investigation in Ibadan.

"We have taken the sample and it came out on [18 Feb 2013], the child is having wild polio virus type one [WPV1]. The whole of this year in the whole of this country, this is the 1st case of the virus; it's unfortunate that the father refused immunisation for all his children. He has a zero dose; that means he has not been immunised before, and unfortunately this child now has polio.

"The tendency of transmitting to other children around him, it is like an epidemic now; over 200 children are at risk of getting this polio. So, what we are going to do now is to carry out a mop-up campaign, to see that we curtail the whole of Kabusa ward."

He observed that cases of polio in the FCT were from people who migrated to the territory from other places. According to Mohammed, once a child has paralysis it is irreversible.

Mohammed said the board would carry out a mop up campaign in the area and its environs, to curtail the spread of the virus to neighbouring communities. He said more health workers would be involved in the mop up campaign, while traditional and religious leader would also collaborate to address the situation.

He noted that there was only one primary health centre in the area but assured that another centre would be established to boost routine immunisation. Mohammed complained of cases of rejection by some residents.

He said that out of 12 wards of AMAC, there were about 9 high-risk wards because of influx of people to those areas. He said the board had a meeting with the WHO, UNICEF, AMAC, National Primary Health Care Development Agency, to discuss how the polio outbreak in the FCT could be addressed.

He identified paucity of fund and inadequate vaccinators as some of the major problems affecting smooth immunisation coverage in the area. Mohammed noted that Nigeria had 96 per cent burden of polio in the whole world, with Afghanistan and Pakistan having only 4 per cent.

He commended government for making the vaccines available, and urged residents to accept immunisation, saying, "prevention is better than cure" [and in the case of polio, there is no cure - Mod.MPP]. Mohammed urged the Polio Emergency Operation Centre to collaborate with the board to address the issue. (NAN)

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Gert van der Hoek <gertvanderhoek@gmail.com> Senior Moderator FluTrackers.com http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/index.php for submitting the same report.

The implications of continued transmission of WPV in the FCT of Nigeria include the possibility of the WPV continuing to spread southward in the country to other pockets of suboptimal immunization.

The FCT has a northern border with Kaduna state (see http://myondostate.com/w3/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Map-of-Nigeria.gif for a map of Nigeria with states). As a reminder, the most recent confirmed case of WPV1 in Niger involved a WPV1 genetically similar to a WPV1 known to be circulating in Kaduna. It would not be surprising to learn the WPV associated with the cases in the FCT are also related genetically to those circulating in Kaduna.

[3] Nigeria - violence against vaccinators

Nigeria: Brutal Killing of Polio Immunization Workers
----------------
The killing of 9 health workers in 2 separate but clearly coordinated attacks in Kano City on [8 Feb 2013] marked a new low in irresponsibility that has become the lot of our society in recent times. Gunmen targeted health workers, nearly all of them women, as they were preparing to set out for their rounds of polio immunization as part of a last-ditch effort to wipe out the polio virus from the face of the earth.

The attacks were launched at 2 locations in the city, Hotoro and Unguwa Uku. No one has as yet claimed responsibility for this dastardly act, the very 1st time in our history that health workers have been targeted by gunmen as they were carrying out a very important public health work.

Even though the attackers have not been identified, it is fairly easy to see what the motive for the attacks could be. In many parts of Northern Nigeria, there is resistance to administration of the oral polio vaccine. This misguided and ill-informed stance has been fuelled by claims of some people, including some clerics, that the vaccine contains an anti-fertility agent that is meant to reduce the population of Muslim lands, claims that have been comprehensively dismissed by the federal and state government health authorities and the Jama'atu Nasril Islam.

In the wake of the Kano killing of health workers, the police arrested and are prosecuting a reporter and a program presenter of Wazobia Radio who the authorities have charged to court for alleged incitement because of a program they broadcast only hours before the attack.

The effort to make polio only the 2nd disease in human history to be completely eradicated, after smallpox, is a very laudable one that has received the support of the Nigerian government and also of responsible traditional and religious authorities. Polio is a debilitating disease that could cause life-long paralysis especially in children less than 5 years of age. No one can deny that the Northern part of the country has the preponderance of such cruelly crippled persons, all of it attributable to the existence in the region of the wild polio virus.

A cursory survey of the streets of Nigerian cities such as Lagos and Kano reveals that a disproportionate number of the persons crippled by polio, and who resort to begging for their livelihood, come from the region. The fact that far fewer persons from Southern Nigeria get stricken by polio due to the smooth nature of polio vaccination campaigns there is sufficient warning that the North must take this matter very seriously.

Instead, there are persons who, despite overwhelming evidence that roundly debunks their stand, still indulge in inciting vulnerable people to reject vaccination for their children with false claims that it reduces fertility of anyone at a time when our population is still growing at more than 3 percent annually. Some of the reasons advanced by the cynics may sound plausible on the face of it, but only on the face of it. They ask, for example, why government and international donors pay so much attention to polio when it is less of a killer than malaria, typhoid and HIV. The truth is that the authorities are paying attention to those problems too, and much more money is actually being spent on malaria and HIV treatment than on polio. The difference is that there is no viable treatment for polio once it cripples a victim; the best treatment is prevention. Here also is a chance to wipe this disease off the face of the Earth. This chance should be grabbed now so that the nation has one less debilitating disease to contend with.

The authorities should continue, with the help of traditional and enlightened religious authorities, the essential task of enlightening people on the importance of seeing to the success of wiping polio off the face of the earth. Yet, if the efforts are continually sabotaged by misguided elements even if they pretend to be enlightened themselves, it is now time to deal firmly with such people. There are adequate laws in place to punish anyone who sabotages public health programs for their own nefarious ends. It is such cruelly misguided activity that ultimately led to the killing of the 9 polio vaccination workers. The authorities should draw up a plan to compensate the families of the slain women who laid down their lives in the service of nation.

[ProMED-mail apologies for the delay in reporting on this incident that occurred on 8 Feb 2013. We continue to be appalled at the violence being directed at public health workers in both Nigeria and Pakistan. This most recent incident is the 1st time there has been violence against vaccinators in Nigeria. One can't help but wonder if the same incentive to violence is behind the attacks in both Pakistan and Nigeria. - Mod.MPP]

- 2 new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 to 9, and one for 2013. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [22 Jan 2013] (from Hilmand). This is the 1st case reported in Afghanistan in 2013.
- SNIDs were held on [10-12 Feb 2013] using trivalent OPV in Helmand and Kandahar and using bivalent OPV elsewhere.

Nigeria
- One new WPV case was reported in the past week (WPV1 from Kano), bringing the total number of WPV cases for 2012 to 122. It is the most recent case in the country and had onset of paralysis on [22 Dec 2012] [Note the cases in the FCT have not been included in the current report - Mod.MPP]
- All states with recently-confirmed WPV cases have been covered by at least 2 large-scale SIAs.
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 8. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [24 Nov 2012] (from Kebbi).

Pakistan
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 2, and the total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 58. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [26 Jan 2013][note, the above table lists the most recent date of onset as 14 Jan 2013] (WPV1 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 16. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2012] (from Balochistan).
- Response activities to the latest WPV cases from 2013 were conducted in parts of KP and in areas of Karachi.
- All provinces with recently-confirmed WPV or cVDPV cases have been covered by at least 2 large-scale SIAs, in response.
- The security situation continues to be monitored closely, in consultation with law enforcement agencies.

Chad
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2012 remains 5. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on 14 June 2012 (WPV1 from Lac).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 12. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [20 Oct 2012] (from Wadi Fira).
- SIAs were conducted on [8-10 Feb 2013] using trivalent OPV.
- The next Technical Advisory Group (TAG) meeting is tentatively scheduled for early April [2013], to review impact of the ongoing emergency action plan.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. No WPV cases have been reported in 2012. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2011] (WPV1 from Maniema).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2012 remains 17. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [4 Apr 2012] (from Katanga).
- SIAs will take place [20-22 Jun 2013] using trivalent OPV and [18-20 Jul 2013] using bivalent OPV.

Horn of Africa
- One new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week, from Somalia, with onset of paralysis on [9 Jan 2013].
- This latest case is linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak ongoing in south-central Somalia since 2011 -- 9 cases were reported in 2011 and one case in 2012 (July). Additionally, in 2012 this outbreak spread across the border to Kenya, with 3 cases reported from Dadaab, in North Eastern Province between April and June 2012.
- In late 2012 and January 2013, access to populations is being achieved for the 1st time in 3 years in key areas of south-central Somalia, as a result of concerted local-access negotiations. An emergency action plan for south-central Somalia has been developed and is being implemented. At the same time, efforts are on-going to further boost population immunity levels in accessible, polio-free areas of Somalia, as well as in border areas of Kenya.
- However, confirmation of this most recent case underscores that the outbreak is ongoing and more outbreak response must be implemented.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. One WPV case was reported in the region in 2012, a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012]. This is the 1st case in the country since December 2011 and is related to virus originating in Nigeria.
- In Niger, outbreak response immunization activities were conducted [15-18 Jan 2013], in close coordination with Nigeria, and were followed by NIDs with trivalent OPV on [2-5 Feb 2013], again synchronized with Nigeria. Vaccinations also focused on reaching mobile populations associated with population movements from Mali, including in refugee camps. OPV continues to be added to broader humanitarian assistance efforts in the region, including in Mali, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Niger.
- Multi-country campaigns are planned across West Africa in April and May 2013.
- SIAs in Central African Republic (CAR) originally scheduled for [8-10 Mar 2013] using trivalent OPV have been postponed until [22-28 Apr 2013] due to security concerns.

Of note in looking at the above tables and reports is that the earlier mentioned case of WPV associated disease in the FCT of Nigeria is not included in the above report. Hence, the total number of confirmed WPV cases for this year [2013] should be 3. And, according to the totals of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type (cVDPV), there have been 2 cases confirmed this year [2013], one in Afghanistan and one in Somalia, both cases being due to infection with cVDPV2. In 2012, there were a total of 66 cases of polio attributable to cVDPV2 and 2 cases of polio attributable to cVDPV3 (For a table showing confirmed cases of polio due to infection with cVDPV by virus type, year and country, see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx). - Mod.MPP]
