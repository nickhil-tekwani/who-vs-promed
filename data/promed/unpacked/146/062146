[Unfortunately, African swine fever (ASF) continues to spread in the Dominican Republic and Haiti.

The 1st outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in the Dominican Republic and Haiti started on 10 Apr 2021 and 26 Aug 2021, respectively.

"ASF is a devastating, deadly disease that would have a significant impact on U.S. livestock producers, their communities and the economy if it were found here. There is no treatment or vaccine available for this disease. The only way to stop this disease is to depopulate all affected or exposed swine herds.

"USDA is working closely with other federal and state agencies, the swine industry, and producers to take the necessary actions to protect our nation's pigs and keep this disease out. This group is also actively preparing to respond if ASF were ever detected in the U.S." Source: USDA-APHIS, "African swine fever" (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/swine-disease-information/african-swine-fever). - Mod.CRD
