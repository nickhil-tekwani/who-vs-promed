A highly contagious form of bird flu has been diagnosed at a poultry farm with 35 000 animals in Altforst, Gelderland. The sector is alarmed because this year's [2020] contamination is early and has entered a barn where high hygiene standards are maintained.

"What is still to come?" asks Hennie de Haan, chairman of the Dutch Poultry Farmers' Union (NVP). "The bird migration, with which the virus spreads, has only just started. Moreover, this is a company where very careful work is done and the animals do not come outside. That it got in there anyway puzzles and worries us."

It is the 4th time in 7 winters that bird flu has been diagnosed in the Netherlands. It has never gotten as bad as in 2003, when the industry seemed doomed. Hundreds of poultry farms were affected and millions of animals had to be culled. As now, it concerned the serious, so-called highly pathogenic variant of bird flu; highly contagious and almost acutely lethal to poultry.

Professor of farm animal health care Arjan Stegeman (Utrecht University) finds the concerns from the sector justified. "A massive amplification of the virus is possible," he says. "It is realistic to think that multiple infections will follow." According to Stegeman, it is now important that poultry farmers pay extra attention to hygiene.

He says it is plausible that faeces from wild water birds entered the stable in Altforst via, for example, a boot from the pasture. "This can happen in the river area, where porters such as wigeons forage." The infected animals are believed to have flown in from Russia, where outbreaks had already occurred.

Although people are only sporadically infected by the variant of the current virus, employees of the company in Altforst are given a flu shot as a precaution. In 2003 the virus did spread to humans, but only to those involved who had worked very intensively around the infected animals. A Dutch vet died at the time from the effects of bird flu.

The breeding plant in Altforst, with chickens and roosters for the production of hatching eggs for the meat industry, will be culled. There are no companies within a kilometer, so preventive clearing is not necessary. A transport ban applies to the 25 poultry farmers within a radius of 10 kilometers [6.2 mi] and they will be tested for bird flu within 3 kilometers [1.9 mi].

"This outbreak will immediately have major economic consequences for our export position," says Gert-Jan Oplaat of the association of the Dutch poultry processing industry. "Countries will lock their borders for us." Products outside the closed zone may be officially exported, but according to Oplaat, "there are always countries that say: the Netherlands is small, we don't get anything from there."

All commercial poultry farms had been obliged to keep chickens and other birds indoors for a week. This obligation followed the diagnosis of bird flu in 2 wild mute swans in the province of Utrecht.

In addition to the commercial housing obligation, zoos, petting zoos, and owners of hobby birds are also obliged to screen their poultry and waterfowl to prevent these animals from coming into contact with wild waterfowl.

Bird flu first appeared in China in 1996, after which it spread and subsequently was not effectively controlled in Southeast Asia. "It gave the virus the chance to constantly switch to wild birds," says professor Stegeman. "Eventually the virus adapted to wild waterfowl, which are hardly affected by it themselves.

[The major 2003 HPAI epizootic in the Netherlands mentioned in the media report above, which involved nearly 500 reported human infections (see archive 20051221.3649), was caused by HPAI H7N7.

The official report of the current outbreak in Altforst (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/XwJe4gyKZxAV1F426) is yet to become available; most likely, it has been caused by the same virus strain, HPAI H5N8, discovered in 2 mute swans found dead on 17 Oct 2020 in a wetland in Kockengen (50 km/31 mi from Altforst, both in the Utrecht province, central Netherlands). This region includes considerable number of poultry farms.

The major 2003 HPAI epizootic in the Netherlands mentioned in the media report above was caused by HPAI H7N7. On top of poultry, wild, and pet birds, this event involved several hundred human infections (reviewed in archive no. 20051221.3649).

The Netherlands is included among the world's leading poultry producers. - Mod.AS
