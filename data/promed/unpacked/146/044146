At least 12 sailors on a Chinese-flagged cargo ship have died of suspected food poisoning off Viet Nam's southern coast, a government official said on Friday [30 Sep 2022]. After receiving distress calls from the ship's captain, authorities in the island district of Con Dao deployed helicopters to bring the victims and 9 other sailors to a hospital onshore, according to Huynh Trung Son, a local government official.

"The survivors are in critical condition and our medical staff are trying to save them," Son said via telephone. We haven't been able to identify the nationality of the sailors, but they are likely Chinese," he added.

The Wu Zhou 8 ship was en route from Thailand to China, he said, adding it was not immediately clear what the ship was transporting. The ship was built in 2013 with a carrying capacity of 76 005 deadweight tonnes, and left Thailand on 28 Sep 2022 for Lianyungang in China, according to data from ship tracking website Marine Traffic.

Vietnamese media reported on 30 Sep 2022 about 18 people suffered food poisoning on a Chinese bulk carrier carrying 21 people while sailing in Vietnamese waters. Twelve people have died so far, and 9 people were sent to a medical center for rescue on 30 Sep 2022. Six of them are in stable condition. Another Vietnamese media quoted the surviving crew as saying they may have been poisoned by eating poisonous fish.

According to a report quoted by Hong Kong 01, the "Vietnam Express", the Chinese bulk carrier "Wuzhou 8" left the Kohsichang port in Chonburi Province, Thailand with cassava on 27 Sep 2022. Originally scheduled to arrive in Lianyungang, China on 8 Oct 2022, an accident occurred in the waters of Viet Nam, and 12 of the 21 crew members died.

The captain of Wuzhou No. 8 asked for help through his agency on the 30 Sep 2022 saying the crew members had food poisoning and were in very critical condition and needed to be sent ashore for medical treatment.

The Vietnamese authorities dispatched a rescue helicopter, but when the rescuers arrived, 10 people on board were dead, so they sent the remaining 11 people to the Con Dao Military and Civilian Medical Center, 110 kilometers (~68 mi) away, for rescue. After treatment, 6 of the 9 patients had recovered and 3 were still in critical condition by the end of the night.

The food on board was prepared by chefs, a crew member recalled Saturday [1 Oct 2022], quoted by the Viet Nam People's Public Security Daily. At noon on 29 Sep 2022 the crew ate canned meat without any problems. At 5:30 pm the same day, everyone ate fish and vegetables together. Around 11 pm, the crew experienced symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and diarrhea was repeated several times.

Viet Nam People's Public Security Daily quoted Viet Nam's Ba Ria-Vung Tau Provincial People's Committee as saying in its report it had issued a document on the incident and sent it to the Vietnamese Prime Minister to read it expeditedly [immediately - Mod.TG].

The committee has instructed various departments, branches and the Con Dao District People's Committee to coordinate the relevant central departments for rescue. The province has notified the Chinese Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City about the incident, coordinated the disposal of the remains of the 12 dead sailors, and assisted in returning the 9 survivors to China after they recovered.

Vietnamese media is reporting fish was most likely the cause of severe food poisoning onboard COSCO Shipping's bulk carrier Wu Zhou 8, which took the lives of at least 12 crewmembers, with unconfirmed reports suggesting one more person has also died.

The Chinese-flagged bulker, while on its way from Thailand to China, requested emergency medical assistance last Friday [30 Sep 2022] after its crew of 21 suddenly fell ill about 63 miles to the southeast of Con Dao island, Ba Ria-Vung Tau province.

Vietnamese authorities dispatched helicopters to bring the victims to a hospital onshore, leaving the vessel without any crew onboard, but by the time the rescue team arrived, 10 crewmembers were already dead. Another 2 died on the way to a hospital on Con Dao island.

One of the interviewed saved crewmembers reportedly said the crew ate duck meat and Chinese canned meat the day before without any problems. However, on Friday evening [30 Sep 2022] the crew had fish and vegetables with many experiencing abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. There were some people who quickly developed this condition, but some didn't show signs of instability until later that night, the crewmember was quoted as saying.

Food safety training remains insufficient among the global merchant fleet, David Steele, the founder of Food Inspection and Training told Splash today [3 Oct 2022], going on to highlight how Chinese companies, in particular, did not tend to spend enough time on the issue.

"Most shipping companies still do not provide sufficient training. And from many years the training provided in China, India and other countries does not meet the learning hours needed to be fully aware of food safety," he said.

This incident shows how important the safe preparation of food is, and in particular ensuring fish is caught and prepared safely, noted Christian Ioannou, chief executive of Marine Catering Training Consultancy (MCTC).

"Fishing can be a relaxing activity while onboard, but it is important to be aware of the risks associated with it. Fish caught in polluted waters or bought from unreliable sources may lead to food poisoning and other medical issues. Fish may take up chemicals in their bodies and in the case of a toxic fish being consumed by mistake, the consequences could be far more dangerous.

"Fish caught from fishing could also be poisonous. There are many species which are extremely poisonous and lethal if consumed. For example, there are enough toxins in one pufferfish to kill 30 adult humans. We would advise taking extreme care while fishing and only fish in safe waters. Do not consume fish you are not familiar with. Fish supplied onboard from well-known suppliers are from reliable sources and are safe to consume.

"It is also important the food is prepared safely. Cooks need to have the proper knowledge of how to safely clean, scale and trim a fish before cooking it. Before scaling, gutting, or filleting, a fish should be thoroughly washed with cold running water to remove the slimy texture which can make the fish slippery and tricky to handle," Ioannou explained.

[Unfortunately, there are few listed clinical signs other than vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and death. There are a couple of toxins I can think of, but neither is a perfect match without more clinical information. Ciguatera poisoning is one and the other is tetrodotoxin. I have included scombrotoxin, but it really does not seem high up on my differential list. These are all detailed below.

Another possibility is the fish was simply spoiled, left out without refrigeration too long, or inadequate refrigeration or chilling, and it is a potent bacterial infection, such as salmonellosis.

"Certain fish -- groupers, barracudas, moray eel, sturgeon, sea bass, red snapper, amberjack, mackerel, parrot fish, surgeonfish, and triggerfish -- can cause ciguatera fish poisoning. The CDC recommends never eating moray eel or barracuda. Other types of fish possibly containing the toxin at unpredictable times include sea bass and a wide range of tropical reef and warm-water fish. Fish containing these toxins do not look, smell, or taste bad. Cooking, marinating, freezing, or stewing does not destroy the toxin.

"The risk of ciguatera poisoning exists in all tropical and subtropical waters of the West Indies, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, where these reef fish are eaten.

"Two other forms of poisoning can happen from naturally occurring toxins in fish: tetrodotoxin, sometimes called pufferfish poisoning or fugu poisoning, and scombroid poisoning.

"Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning generally appear between a few minutes and 6 hours after the toxic fish has been eaten. These include a variety of gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular abnormalities. The following are the most common symptoms of ciguatera poisoning. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Watery diarrhea
- Headache
- Numbness and tingling about the mouth and extremities

"In more severe cases, the person may suffer muscle pains, dizziness, and sensations of temperature reversal, where hot things seem cold and cold things seem hot. Irregular heart rhythms and low blood pressure may also be experienced. Ciguatera poisoning symptoms typically resolve within several days, but may last up to 4 weeks. The symptoms of ciguatera poisoning may resemble other medical conditions. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.

"Treatment for ciguatera poisoning involves relieving the symptoms and treating any complications. There is no specific antidote for the toxin itself. Generally, recovery takes from several days to several weeks.

"Tetrodotoxin, also called pufferfish poisoning or fugu poisoning, is a much rarer form of fish poisoning. Yet, it is potentially very serious. This is almost exclusively associated with eating the pufferfish from waters of the Indo-Pacific regions. There have also been several reported cases of poisonings, including fatalities, from pufferfish from the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Gulf of California. Pufferfish poisoning is a continuing problem in Japan.

"Symptoms generally appear between 20 minutes and 3 hours after eating the poisonous pufferfish. The following are the most common symptoms of pufferfish poisoning. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
- Numbness of lips and tongue
- Numbness of face and extremities
- Sensations of lightness or floating
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Diarrhea
- Slurred speech
- Difficulty walking
- Extensive muscle weakness
- Convulsions
- Respiratory distress
- Mental impairment
- Cardiac arrhythmia

"Death can happen within 4 to 6 hours of poisoning. It is essential to seek immediate medical attention.

"Treatment for pufferfish poisoning consists of limiting the body's absorption of the toxin, relieving symptoms, and treating life-threatening complications. There is no known antidote for tetrodotoxin.

"Scombrotoxin, also called scombroid poisoning or histamine poisoning, happens after eating fish that contain high levels of histamine due to improper food handling. It remains one of the most common forms of fish poisoning in the United States and worldwide. These fish, which include mahi-mahi (dolphin fish), albacore tuna, bluefin and yellowfin tuna, bluefish, mackerel, sardines, anchovy, herring, marlin, amberjack, and abalone, have high amounts of histidine. As a result of inadequate refrigeration or preservation, bacteria convert the histidine to histamine. This leads to scombroid poisoning. Contaminated fish may appear and taste fresh, although some may taste "peppery," "spicy," or "bubbly." The toxin may form even if the fish has only been temporarily stored at too high a temperature.

"This form of fish poisoning happens worldwide in temperate and tropical waters.

"Symptoms generally appear within minutes to an hour after eating affected fish. They typically last 3 hours, but can last several days. The following are the most common symptoms of scombroid poisoning. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
- Tingling or burning sensations in the mouth
- Rash on the face and upper body
- Wheezing or shortness of breath
- Drop in blood pressure
- Throbbing headache
- Hives and itching of skin
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Diarrhea

"The symptoms of scombroid poisoning may resemble other medical conditions. Many cases of 'fish allergy' are actually scombroid poisoning. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.

"Treatment for scombroid poisoning is generally unnecessary. Symptoms usually resolve within 12 hours and scombroid poisoning is rarely life-threatening. Treatment could include antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine and cimetidine.

"Specific treatment for all fish and shellfish poisoning is based on:
- Your overall health and medical history
- Extent of the disease
- Your tolerance for specific medicines, procedures, and therapies
- Your opinion or preference"
