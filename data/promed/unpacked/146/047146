Reversal of Symptoms in vCJD Patient Undergoing Drug Treatment
--------------------------------------------------------------
A Briton believed to be suffering from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as vCJD or CJD (new var.) has shown remarkable
improvement after being given a pioneering drug in the US. The patient, a
20-year old woman, had been told by doctors that she could have the human
form of mad cow disease.
The victim, from Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside, was given just a year to
live. She was confined to a wheelchair and could not recognise her parents
as her condition degenerated. But Nobel Prize winner Professor Stanley
Prusiner enrolled her in a new drug trial which has transformed her health.
According to a press report in the "Mail on Sunday," after just 19 days of
treatment the young woman was able to walk unaided, talk, use a knife and
fork, and complete coordination tests that were previously impossible. The
patient's mother said the family had decided to go ahead with the treatment
at the University of California School of Medicine as a last resort. "At
the end of the day we had nothing to lose because we were told that Rachel
would die and we had everything to gain if this did work," she told Channel
4 News on Sunday. "What they said was this treatment had only ever been
done in test tubes in the laboratory and had never been tried on a human
being."
The drug trials will bring hope to sufferers and their families - 99 people
have died from the disease since 1996 and 7 more suspected sufferers are
still alive. British officials have been in contact with Professor
Prusiner's team and a Department of Health spokesman said they found the
results promising. But he added: "Until the work is published and we have a
chance to look at it properly, we cannot comment properly. In particular,
the fact that there is still no reliable test for vCJD which can be carried
out on a living person means that doctors cannot even be sure if the
patient had the illness in the first place."
David Body, the solicitor representing vCJD victims and their families,
echoed the calls for caution but added: "Anything that is seen to bring an
improvement should be welcomed with great enthusiasm." Malcolm Tibbett, of
the Human BSE Foundation, also urged the need for caution. He said:
"Obviously there is no one who would be more happy if it did turn out to a
treatment for this illness. It gives hope for the future."

[The reversal of progressive neurological disease and successful treatment
of a prion-related disease would rank among the major achievements of
modern medicine. However, until the evidence is published and the diagnosis
of vCJD can be confirmed, this report must be interpreted with extreme
caution. - Mod.CP
