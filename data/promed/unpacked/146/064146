Enigmatic disease no longer attacks pigs
----------------------------------------
The Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) on pigs has been
effectively treated, said Nguyen Van Cam, deputy director of the Central
Veterinary Diagnosis Centre. According to Mr Cam, since the Veterinary
Department instructed farmers how to prevent and cure the PRRS in their
pigs, the situation is quite satisfactory. The Central Veterinary Diagnosis
Centre has not received any blood samples sent from provinces to test for PRRS.
Starting in the northern province of Hai Duong on 12 Mar 2007, this
mysterious disease has spread to many northern provinces like Hung Yen, Bac
Ninh, Son La, Thai Binh, Hanoi, and Bac Giang. [See Northern Area map in
<http://www.angelfire.com/co/hongnam/vnmap.html>].
Worried by seeing their healthy pigs suddenly leaving their meal untouched
and dying _en masse_, many breeders have sold ill pigs, which makes it
difficult for state agencies to control the disease. On 13 Apr 2007,
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Cao Duc Phat sent a dispatch
asking provinces to urgently prevent the selling of ill pigs to avoid
spreading the disease.
PRRS, which appeared for the first time in 1987, is listed among dangerous
contagious diseases in the world. This disease was reported in Vietnam in 1997.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Joseph Dudley
[PRRS (also known as blue ear disease) is one of the 7 swine diseases in
the updated OIE list (the others are: African swine fever, classical swine
fever, Nipah virus encephalitis, porcine cysticercosis, swine vesicular
disease, and transmissible gastroenteritis).
Its recent spread and allegedly severe clinical manifestation in Guandong,
south eastern China, have led the Chinese authorities to submit an official
report to the OIE on 9 May 2007, mentioning, as the reason for
notification, a "change in epidemiology". According to the said
notification, the outbreak had started on 23 Apr 2007, causing a case
fatality rate of 20 per cent; (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5387>.
Several news media reported that haemorrhages were seen as well in affected
Chinese pigs; if this is accurate, other disease agents, such as cclassical
swine fever (CSF), deserve to be considered as well in the testing procedures.
It will be interesting to compare the Chinese isolates and clinical
observations to those reported from Vietnam. Vietnam officially notified
the OIE on 10 Apr 2007; an update was sent on 19 Apr 2007.- Mod.AS].
