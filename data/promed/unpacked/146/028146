The staff from Invima [National Institute for Drug and Food
Surveillance by its initials in Spanish] and from laboratories of the
Cauca department [state or province equivalent] Secretariat of Health
have been conducting a series of studies to identify the causes of an
outbreak of gastroenteritis that affected about 128 people and was
linked to a well-known fast food restaurant.

According to an initial report from the Cauca Secretariat of Health,
although laboratory results are still pending for some of the samples
taken from patients, preliminary results indicate that the patients
contracted salmonellosis after eating contaminated meat.

[The outbreak apparently took place in the capital of Cauca
department, Popayan. It is unusual for clusters of salmonellosis to be
posted from South or Central America, probably because the high
endemicity of the infection in those areas. No serotype of the _S.
enterica_ is reported. - Mod.LL]
