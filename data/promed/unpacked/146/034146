[1] Cholera - Haiti
Date: Fri 21 Oct 2011

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Fri 21 Oct 2011 said the number
of cholera cases in Haiti was expected to reach 500 000 by the end of
2011.

"If current trends continue, we can expect around 75 000 more cases by
the end of the year bringing the total to approximately 500 000 cases
since the beginning of the epidemic," WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic
said. In October 2011, WHO had already recorded 470 000 cases.

The number of new cholera cases in Haiti halved in August 2011, but
the rainy season is once again worsening the situation, WHO warned.

"We are going towards an endemic situation," noted Claire-Lise
Chaignat, who heads WHO's anti-cholera group. "We should consider
cholera vaccine introduction to Haiti for the most vulnerable. This
discussion is ongoing," added Chaignat. But you can imagine that it is
not easy to identify where to start, with the limited amount of
vaccines available, because the vaccines are still produced in a very
limited amount and quantity," she said, adding that she hoped this
would change with the production of new vaccines in India.

[2] Cholera - Haiti/Dominican Republic border

More than 480 people have died of cholera and 1800 others have
suffered from the disease in 2011 on the Haitian-Dominican border,
where a new outbreak of the cholera has been reported, a civil
organization said here on Thu 20 Oct 2011.

The new outbreak of the epidemics affected the bordering region and
cases are increasing, in a zone where there is no drinking water or
centers for the control of the disease. According to the Jeannot Succ
Is Bordering Net, settlers in Bocbanique (a central Haitian
department) have to walk 11.2 miles for medical services.

Less than 2 per cent of the 9 million inhabitants in Haiti have access
to drinking water, while most of the population uses latrines or make
their physiological needs in the open, in places like rivers, or close
to their houses.

[3] Cholera, imported - Bahamas

The Ministry of Health wishes to report that a person was intercepted
at sea and detained at the Detention Centre. The detainee appeared
unwell on arrival, was treated for suspected cholera, and has since
been repatriated. There was no contact between the person and the
community-at-large. Laboratory tests later confirmed cholera.

As reported, Haiti has an increased rate of cholera. The Ministry of
Health continues its heightened surveillance activities and other
necessary precautions to identify cases and prevent the transmission
of cholera in The Bahamas. The public is reminded to use clean water
and maintain good hygienic practices to prevent cholera from
spreading.

[The origin of the cholera-infected individual is not stated, but
given the ongoing epidemic of the disease on the island of Hispanola,
particularly in Haiti, it is more than likely that the person was
infected there. Whether additional cases will occur in the area of the
detention center on Nassau will depend on the adequacy of the sewage
system there. - Mod.LL
