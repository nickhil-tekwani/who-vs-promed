[Excerpts - emphasis added - Mod.JW
Frozen strawberries processed by the same California processor/packer on the
same three dates in April and May 1996 as those associated with the outbreak
in Michigan, but with DIFFERENT lot codes, were supplied through the USDA to
school lunch programs in:
Florida
Illinois
Indiana
Maine
New Jersey
New York
North Carolina
North Dakota
Washington D.C.
and
Wisconsin.
Although there has been NO association with illness, the USDA has placed a
hold on
these products. Since these frozen strawberries have NOT been associated
with illness, the CDC does NOT recommend that these states implement any
intervention measures at this time.
The FDA is collecting information on the commercial distribution of frozen
strawberries processed and packed on these three dates by the California
company (regardless of whether they were from the Michigan suspect lots).
Information to date indicates that since last spring product was supplied to
commercial distributors in [besides the states mentioned above:
Colorado
Georgia
Massachusetts
Oklahoma
Oregon
and
British Columbia
and was processed into a variety of end products.
Some of these products, such as fruit concentrate, were pasteurized using a
method which should inactivate hepatitis A virus, while others, such as
margarita mix, were not.
More specific information on the end products, the areas to which each
distributor sent products, and specific lots and shipping dates is not yet
available.
The processor/packer has sent out a "sub-recall" notice to its distributors
for products made with strawberries from the three processing dates. The
products made from these lots are likely to have been distributed
commercially throughout the past year and much may already have been consumed.
Since NO cases of hepatitis A have been linked to frozen strawberries
outside of the school lunch program in Michigan, the CDC does NOT recommend
that states take any further measures at this time related to these
commercially distributed products, unless additional information becomes
available.
States should heighten surveillance for hepatitis A, particularly among
school aged children, and investigate cases rapidly. We would appreciate
notification of any hepatitis A cases suspected to be associated with frozen
strawberries....
[People who suspect they may have contracted hepatitis from consuming FROZEN
strawberries, or products containing them, in March 1997 should contact
their State health department -- NOT CDC, which can only respond to requests
from States, not individuals - Mod.JW

[Would someone with epidemiological experience of Hepatitis A infections
please explain how one can have high attack rates in two Michigan schools
but nothing elsewhere - all presumeably sharing the same distribution of
these frozen strawberries processed in April & May, 1996. MHJ
