[2] Saudi Arabia, renal dialysis exposure - media report
Date: Fri 24 Oct 2014

The family of a 56 year old victim of the MERS coronavirus has called for an investigation into his death. Members of the family suspect that the 56 year old deceased [male] from Taif, may have been infected with MERS during dialysis treatment at King Abdulaziz Specialized Hospital, according to a recent report in local media.

Two family members claimed that he got the virus while undergoing dialysis treatment. They said [that he] suffered from kidney failure. He was a patient at Taif Mental Health Hospital for more than a year, they said. They called on the ministry to investigate how he fell ill.

According to the report, acting health minister Adel Fakeih recently visited King Abdulaziz Specialized Hospital and criticized the close manner in which dialysis patients had to sit. As a result, he ordered health director in Taif, Matooq Al-Osaimi, to establish a dialysis center at King Faisal Hospital with a capacity of 120 beds. The ministry also plans to reduce overuse of dialysis machines by providing up to 20 additional machines at King Faisal Hospital, which will also receive referrals of dialysis patients from King Abdulaziz Hospital. The ministry has taken several measures to curb the spread of MERS in the summer resort city of Taif. 10 cases of infections were found in the Taif area over the past 2 weeks.

Measures include finding people who came into contact with the MERS patients, and doctors transferring patients from King Abdulaziz Hospital to King Faisal Hospital, the designated MERS hospital in Taif. The ministry is also providing Taif with a mobile laboratory to allow for additional testing and expediting the delivery of test results; transferring some of the intensive care patients from King Abdulaziz and King Faisal hospitals to Riyadh and Jeddah; and assessing and monitoring infection control measures at all ministry facilities.

[3] Saudi Arabia, other theory on Taif outbreak
Date: Sat 25 Oct 2014
Source: Maktoob News, Saudi Gazette report [edited]
https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/central-ac-linked-taif-mers-spread-081555689.html


Sources have revealed that they suspect the central air conditioning at the Taif Dialysis Center for spreading the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the center. The theory was put forward to explain how an employee in the IT department at the hospital tested positive for the virus.

Acting minister of health Adel Fakeih has visited the hospital and instructed the hospital's management to find suitable solutions and separate patient beds to prevent the virus from further spreading.

[With today's (25 Oct 2014) newly reported case, there have now been 775 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 329 deaths (case fatality rate 42.5 per cent) reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012. The most recent case is from Taif and is considered a nosocomially acquired case as there is a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the healthcare environment. The newly reported recovered case was reported as a confirmed case on 20 Oct 2014 (see MERS-CoV (39): Saudi Arabia, new cases, deaths 20141021.2887774).

A total of 17 cases of MERS-CoV infection have now been confirmed in Taif since the beginning of September 2014, including 5 deaths (case fatality rate 29.4 per cent). 13 of these 17 cases have occurred since 1 Oct 2014. Four of the 17 cases (23.5 per cent) were in healthcare workers; 4 (23.5 per cent) had a history of exposure to camels/consumption of camel milk or lived near camel farms; 3 of the cases (17.6 per cent) were stated to have become infected while in the healthcare environment, and the remaining 6 (35.3 per cent), while there was no history of currently accepted high risk exposures, all 6 had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities, suggesting they may have had contact with the health sector for their co-morbidities and, during those contacts, may well have been exposed to other MERS-CoV infected individuals.

The 2 media reports related to the Taif outbreak (in [2] and [3]) surround the theory that a location where transmission of the MERS-CoV occurred was in the dialysis unit at the King Abdulaziz Specalized Hospital. As the MOH report on the Taif outbreak made recommendations specifically directed at changing patient management in the dialysis units, it is likely that there have been a number of MERS-CoV infected individuals who spent time in the dialysis unit. The idea that the central air conditioning system may have served as an aerosolizer for other parts of the hospital to explain infection of an IT (information technology/computer) department employee seems a bit far fetched. A more likely scenario would be sharing an elevator or walking down the corridor near or beside an infected individual but, in the absence of studies addressing this, the possibility should not be rejected out of hand.

In the earlier nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV noted in the Eastern Province in May 2013, one of the high risk exposure locations identified was also the dialysis unit. A review of previous reports on ProMED-mail shows that numerous cases have been reported to have been on dialysis -- a case in Jeddah in June 2014, one in Makkah in May 2014, a case in Abu Dhabi (UAE) in April 2014 (who had visited Saudi Arabia in the incubation period -- we queried whether this individual was dialyzed while in Saudi Arabia), another case in UAE in early April 2014, a Filipina expat dialyzed in Riyadh in September 2013 (see references below for more details on these case reports). As a reminder, the clinical course for many of the severe MERS-CoV infections included renal failure requiring dialysis (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (36): updated surveillance recommendations, WHO 20130628.1797470 for a discussion on the clinical presentations). One can't help but wonder if patients hospitalized with MERS-CoV and renal failure have been dialyzed in the hospital based dialysis units, as this seems to be a recurrent theme throughout the course of MERS-CoV history since 2012.

A map showing the locations of the newly reported laboratory-confirmed case and recovered case can be found at the source URL of the report.
