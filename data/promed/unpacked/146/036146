On Mon 30 Apr 2007, a 3-member team of epidemiologists from the
School of Tropical Medicine [Calcutta] visited those areas in Nadia
where 5 people died in the past 2 weeks of a particular
[unidentified] disease. The members (comprising Dr Tapan Saha, Dr
Anirudha Mukherjee, and Dr Tapas Sen) first visited the houses of 2
victims in Krishnagar and collected blood samples of 10 people who
are close relatives of the victims. In Krishnagar, [a 36-year-old
victim] from Chowdhuripara and [a 48-year-old victim] from Dakshin
Kalinagar died of the disease on Fri [27 Apr 2007] and Sat [28 Apr
2007], respectively. [The 36-year-old] X-ray technician of Chapra
rural hospital had reportedly gone to collect blood samples from a
family at Tehatta that lost 3 of its members after they fell ill in a
similar way. [The 48-year-old victim], the son-in-law of the head of
the same family, also fell ill during [a recent] visit to his in-laws
recently. [The 1st] died at a private hospital in Kolkata [Calcutta],
while [the 2nd died at the Infectious Disease Hospital, Beleghata.
According to the district health department reports, the 2 victims
showed symptoms of viral encephalitis such as high fever, headache,
and convulsion. The victims also suffered inflammation in the
encephalon area of the central nervous system. The School of Tropical
Medicine epidemiologists have concluded from their visit that the 2
victims died of viral encephalitis. The district magistrate, Mr Onkar
Singh Meena, said: "All preventive measures will be taken to combat
the situation." Since encephalitis or dengue is a mosquito-borne
disease, steps have been taken in these areas to control the breeding
of mosquitoes."

[The nature of the undiagnosed disease causing fatalities among
relatives in this region of Bengal remains unresolved by the visit of
experts from the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine, but the
balance of opinion at present favours an outbreak of dengue fever.
The results of laboratory analysis of blood samples taken from the
contacts of the victims are awaited. - Mod.CP.
