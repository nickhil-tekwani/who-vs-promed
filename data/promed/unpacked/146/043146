---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent outbreak in Auckland belies the fact that rates of hepatitis A in New Zealand are low. In fact, since 2000 incidence figures for all forms of viral hepatitis in this country have even been exceeded by those of leptospirosis and rheumatic fever [1]; http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Hepatitis-NZ.png.

During the same period, rates of hepatitis A among the six major English-speaking countries have been decreasing, and continue to be surprisingly similar; see graph [2]; http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/HepA-Eng.png.

Only one country in this group, the United States, employs routine vaccination against hepatitis A. Two other countries, Canada and Australia, administer the vaccine to high-risk populations only [3].
