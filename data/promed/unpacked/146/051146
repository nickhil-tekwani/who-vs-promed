Zoonotic disease reporting - USA (Texas) 990318214822

From: James, Edward A. LT(USN) <jamese@samhou.5tharmy.army.mil>

A recent Domestic Preparedness table top exercise in San Antonio included a
weapons of mass destruction (WMD) scenario where anthrax was released at a
park in downtown San Antonio near the zoo. The scenario included animals in
the zoo becoming sick and dying. This lead to the question as to what is
the capability of the zoo's or other local veterinarian capability to test
for anthrax or other biological agents? There were no state PHS [public
health service representatives at the exercise who could answer this
question.
Both the speed of detection and reporting are critical factors when it
comes to identifying a covert release of a biological agent. Veterinary
reporting could be very valuable in this aspect.

[Many veterinarians have long held the belief that their knowledge may be
first line of defense when dealing with biological agents. - Mod.TG
[As anthrax is not unexpected in zoological collections and well reported
in the scientific literature, thanks to the feeding of dead and morbid
animals to the carnivores, the simultaneous deaths of a number of varied
species should trigger such a suspicion in an experienced zoo veterinarian.
For example there is last year's experience in Winnepeg. Plus veterinary
diagnostic laboratories are experienced in the necessary procedures, even
if the clinician does not have the slides, stains and microscope. - Mod.MHJ
