Murray Valley encephalitis and Ross River virus have been confirmed
as the cause of the unusual neurological syndromes in horses in
Northern Victoria and around Ballarat with Kunjin virus also suspected
to be causing disease. The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) was
alerted to the 1st case of Ross River virus [infection] in December
last year [2010], however, without serial paired serum samples it was
not known if active infection had occurred.

>From the start of February [2011], a number of reports were received
of horses showing unusual neurological signs with Ross River virus and
Murray Valley encephalitis the likely suspects.

To date, horses on 130 properties are suspected or confirmed to have
an arbovirus infection. Horses on 3 properties have tested positive to
Murray Valley encephalitis while horses on 9 properties have been
positive to Ross River virus. 2 horses have also shown results highly
suspicious of Kunjin virus. However, paired serological samples are
required to confirm active infection.

The most commonly reported signs in affected horses include:
reluctance to walk, ataxia, listlessness, oedema, stiff gait,
behavioural change, depression and pyrexia. Reports of horses with
nervous signs have also been received from parts of South Australia
and New South Wales (NSW). Laboratory testing in these States has
indicated the presence of MVE and Kunjin viruses, while Japanese
encephalitis and Hendra [viruses] have been ruled out. It is likely
the milder infection seen in the south is due to Ross River virus
while a both arboviruses are occurring in the north. Ross River virus
and Murray Valley encephalitis [virus] are transmitted by _Culex_
mosquitoes and are endemic in many parts of northern Australia and in
other tropical areas of the world.

Although not conclusively shown, serological and virus isolation
studies have suggested marsupials are the reservoir hosts of the virus
Ross River virus. Serological testing has shown a range of animals
capable of being infected including: horses, birds, cats, swine, goat,
sheep, cattle, bush-rats and flying fox. Horses are the only animal
(besides people) known to be clinically affected.

Waterbirds are the natural reservoirs of Murray Valley encephalitis
[virus], with humans among a number of incidental hosts. Domesticated
animals including chicken, pigs, cattle and horses may be
experimentally infected but are not thought to play a role in the
transmission cycle. Following a fatal outbreak of Murray Valley
encephalitis in 1974, the DPI commenced an arbovirus monitoring
program on behalf of the Department of Health testing sentinel poultry
to provide an early warning of incursions into Victoria.

With these sentinel poultry already testing positive to Murray Valley
encephalitis [virus antibodies], Department of Health is also using
horse serology, including data already provided by veterinarians, to
assist their surveillance across the rest of the state in the hope
that transmission to people can be minimised.

Vets should consider Murray Valley encephalitis virus infection as a
differential diagnosis when investigating any horse displaying
unexplained neurological signs, particularly those cases suggestive of
viral encephalitis.

[The report above indicates that paired sera (acute and convalescent
phase) are needed to establish a serological diagnosis, but imply that
paired sera were not available at least for Kunjim virus antibody
testing. Were all the other virological diagnoses made on the basis of
paired sera testing? - Mod.TY]

Biosecurity SA is continuing to receive reports of horses showing
unusual neurological signs in South Australia. The neurological signs
include ataxia (wobbly in the legs and difficulty walking), muscle
tremors and sensitivity to touch. Similar cases are still being
reported in Victoria and NSW.

Since the middle of February [2011] a total of 45 neurological cases
in horses have been reported by private veterinarians to Biosecurity
SA. These reported neurological cases are spread across the state from
the Riverland, down the length of the Murray and areas both north and
south of Adelaide from Port Pirie to Victor Harbor.

All reported horses are being tested for a range of mosquito born
viruses including Ross River virus and a group of viruses called
'flaviviruses' that includes Kunjin virus and Murray Valley
encephalitis virus. Laboratory results so far have indicated that a
mosquito-borne flavivirus may be responsible for the clinical signs in
some of the horses. These horses have also tested positive to Ross
River virus. Further results for cases are pending but, due to the
increase in demand for laboratory testing, these results may take a
few weeks to be received.

There is no suggestion that Hendra virus is involved in this
syndrome. Cases that have been tested for Hendra virus have returned
negative results.

There is no known risk to humans from direct contact with horses
infected with mosquito-transmitted viruses. However humans, as with
horses, can be infected from the bite of an infected mosquito for some
diseases.

Owners can attempt to protect their horses from mosquitoes by using
repellents, covering them up, keeping them indoors at times of high
mosquito activity (dawn and dusk) and minimising possible mosquito
breeding areas. Horse owners should contact their local veterinarian
if their horse is unwell or behaving strangely. The vet can then work
with Biosecurity SA to undertake a disease investigation on cases with
neurological signs.

Since February [2011], there have been an increased number of reports
of NSW horses displaying unusual nervous signs. Similar cases have
also been reported in Victoria and South Australia. Laboratory testing
suggests that a majority of cases are due to infection with one or
more Australian strains of mosquito-borne Flaviviruses that includes
viruses like Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus. All
testing to date has ruled out Japanese encephalitis virus.

NSW cases are widely distributed, mostly west of the Great Divide
from Mungindi in the north to the Murray River, and including a
significant cluster in the Hawkesbury Valley west of Sydney and also
the Upper Hunter Valley.

Early signs of infection may include depression or mild colic. These
initial signs are followed by nervous signs include lack of
coordination, high stepping in front, weakness in the hind quarters,
muscle twitching and increased responsiveness to touch and sound. In
some cases there has been facial paralysis or twitching, especially of
the lips. Severely affected horses may fall repeatedly or develop
convulsions. Good husbandry under veterinary supervision will assist
in recovery.

As of 31 Mar 2011 more than 100 horses in NSW have been reported to
be showing signs of infection. Most cases to date have gradually
recovered over a period of 1 - 3 weeks. Some horses are severely
affected and around 15 of the affected horses are reported to have
died or been euthanized for welfare reasons. Necropsies are taking
place on infected dead horses to determine the cause of these
infections. This condition is not related to Hendra. All NSW cases
have been tested for Hendra virus and all have returned negative
results.

Flaviviruses are one of a number of groups of arboviruses (viruses
carried by insects) that occur naturally in Australia. The very wet
season across much of Australia has resulted in high insect numbers
and an increased risk of infection.

It is likely that many horses may be infected but only a small
proportion of infected horses will become ill. This means that a
positive blood test must be carefully interpreted. Repeat testing will
be needed to show that antibody levels are rising. Samples are being
tested at the Virology Laboratory at the Elizabeth Macarthur
Agricultural Institute, Camden.

Horse owners should try to reduce the exposure of their animals to
insect bites to minimise the risk of infection and ensure they are in
good condition so that they have a strong immune system. Both
registered chemical treatments and physical barriers such as fly veils
and rugs will assist to minimise insect bites.

The horse is usually a 'dead-end' host for mosquito-borne arbovirus
infections and is not considered a likely source of new infection for
people or other horses.

Owners who notice horses displaying unusual signs should contact
their private veterinarian.

Two distinct diseases in Australian outbreaks
----------------
Australian horses infected by what authorities believe are
mosquito-borne viruses appear to be affected by 2 distinct syndromes.

Veterinarians in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia are
reporting increased numbers of horses with 2 distinct disease
syndromes, either predominantly muscle and joint soreness, or unusual
nervous signs.

The wet spring and summer across large areas of Australia have
resulted in an increased risk of insect-borne infections.

The Australian Horse Industry Council says horses are a dead-end host
for mosquito-borne arbovirus infections, which means that a horse is
not a source of new infection for people or other horses.

Reports of horses with nervous signs have originated from:
- Along the Murray River in Victoria.
- The southeastern region of South Australia.
- Various locations in New South Wales, including west of the Great
Divide, from Mungindi in the north to the Murray River, and a
significant cluster in the Hawkesbury Valley west of Sydney, and also
the Upper Hunter Valley.Some horses have been severely affected.

Most horses with clinical signs recover over several weeks with good
husbandry and veterinary care. However, as of 30 March 2011, of the
100 cases in New South Wales, around 15 have died or have had to be
euthanised for animal welfare reasons.

Laboratory testing of samples from the horses with soreness indicates
that most infections are probably due to Alphavirus infections,
including Ross River virus.

Testing of samples from horses with unusual nervous signs suggests
that a majority of cases are due to infection with one or more viruses
belonging to the Flavivirus group of viruses that includes viruses
such as Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus.

Testing of samples to date has ruled out Japanese encephalitis virus.
The deadly Hendra virus infection has also been ruled out from all 4
states - Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
Necropsies are taking place on infected dead horses to determine the
cause of the infections.

Veterinarians and any assistants have been urged to take stringent
precautions when performing necropsies on horses showing neurological
clinical signs.

They have been warned that great care should be exercised when
handling brain and spinal cord tissue and appropriate personal
protective equipment should be used as part of a risk management
approach to personal safety. The horse council said there had been no
increased incidence of muscle/joint soreness or nervous signs in
horses reported in Queensland.

It has urged horse owners to reduce the exposure of their animals to
insect bites, in particular mosquitoes.

Owners can use registered repellent products, rug their horses and
use fly masks.

Horses suffering from these arboviruses commonly display clinical
signs including, but not limited to:
- A reluctance to walk.
- A stiff gait.
- Poor co-ordination.
- Depression.
- Tremors.

Owners who notice that their horses displaying unusual signs should
immediately contact their private veterinarian.

[One of the questions that comes to mind is what kind of diagnostics
is being used to distinguish the possible diseases?

Certainly there seem to be 2 syndromes, or it means that the disease
character of at least one disease is changing?

We look forward to more information on the kind and type of
diagnostics. – Mod.TG]
