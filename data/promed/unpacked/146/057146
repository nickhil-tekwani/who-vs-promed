Blood samples from Philippines sent to US to check for Ebola
------------------------------------------------------------
Blood samples from swine and farmhands in the Philippines have been sent to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to test
for the Ebola-Reston virus, health secretary Francisco Duque said on Friday
[16 Jan 2009]. The samples were collected by a joint team from the Food and
Agriculture Organisation [FAO], the World Organisation for Animal Health
[OIE], and the World Health Organization [WHO] from 2 pig farms where the
Ebola-Reston virus had been detected.

"I have directed the RITM (Research Institute of Tropical Medicine of the
Philippines) to immediately send the collected samples from the 2 farms to
CDC for testing," Duque said. "We expect the results to come out any time
in the next few weeks, he added.

Dr Lyndon Leesuy, a member of the Philippine team involved in the
investigation, said that sending the samples to CDC in Atlanta, Georgia,
was not a sign that they were positive for the Ebola-Reston virus. "It's
just for confirmation and thorough laboratory analysis," because the
Philippines does not have the facilities to conduct such tests, said Leesuy.

The Agriculture Department is still maintaining its quarantine on the 2
farms as well as the voluntary ban on the export of pork until the results
of the CDC tests are released, officials said.

Ebola-Reston, which is found only in the Philippines, had been confined to
monkeys and the latest outbreak among pigs is the 1st time it has jumped
species.

As of December [2008], nearly 6000 pigs at the farms in Pandi and Talavera
town outside Manila had tested positive for the virus, which is not known
to be harmful to humans but could have a devastating impact on the pig
industry.

Ebola-Reston is different from the Ebola sub-types found in Africa that
cause deadly haemorrhagic fever in humans. Ebola-Reston was 1st detected in
1989 in laboratory monkeys sent from the Philippines to Reston, Virginia,
in the US.

Ebola-infected farms still under quarantine
-------------------------------------------
Pending the final results conducted by CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, on the
reported discovery of the Ebola Reston virus (ERV), Department of
Agriculture secretary Arthur Yap directed to maintain the quarantine in the
2 farms as well as the voluntary export ban of raw and processed swine
products which he instituted in December [2008].

"We decided to keep the farms in quarantine and suspend the export of our
hogs until we have a better grasp of the extent, nature and consequences of
the Reston virus to the health of animals and humans," Yap explained.

This developed after the secretary Francisco Duque III of the Department of
Health sought the help of CDC. "I have directed RITM (Research Institute of
Tropical Medicine) to immediately send the collected samples from the 2
farms to CDC for testing and we expect the results to come out any time in
the next few weeks," Duque said.

The joint mission composed of experts in animal and human health from the
FAO, the OIE, the WHO and their national counterparts reported on the
progress of the mission last Wednesday [14 Jan 2009] in an executive
session with Yap and Duque. The mission was tasked to investigate the
recent discovery of the ERV in pigs in the Philippines.

During the past 10 days, they conducted risk assessment, field
investigations and collection of samples for laboratory testing in the 2
farms in Bulacan and Pangasinan where ERV was detected.

Negros Occidental hogs found free from Ebola Reston virus
---------------------------------------------------------
Negros Occ. Provincial Veterinarian Renante Decena declared hogs in the
province remain free from the Ebola Reston virus that hit hog farms in
Luzon. Being free from such virus, consumption of pork in Negros Occ. is
safe but warned buyers to always check the animal products they buy as a
precautionary measure.

Animal products going into the province have been strictly monitored since
the reported outbreak of the virus late last year [2008] as other animal
diseases like, Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) are also on the watch list of
banned items. The Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO) has also been
coordinating with the higher office in Manila to prepare the province for
any eventualities and see to it that the provincial government is able
respond to emergencies.

Bago City Veterinarian Eliezer De la Cruz told PIA that some years ago
monkeys from the Philippines were sent to Reston, Virginia, USA, for study
and scientists there discovered the Ebola virus from the primate and named
it after the place, Reston, where the virus was discovered. He said Bago
City is also on alert for Ebola as a great number of hogs are raised in
their area. The city is also negative of Ebola virus case, so far, he
disclosed.

The Reston type, however, is not fatal compared to the Ebola virus found in
Africa.

UN experts test blood sample of 600 pigs
----------------------------------------
United Nations (UN) technical experts yesterday [Tue 13 Jan 2009] conducted
microscopy [a term in need of explanation/correction. - Mod.AS] of blood
serum samples from 600 live pigs from a farm in Pandi, Bulacan, for further
studies on the presence of Ebola Reston virus (ERV). The Provincial
Agriculture Office (PAO) said preliminary results of the said laboratory
test are expected to come out after a few weeks.

Since this is the 1st case of ERV found outside monkeys, experts from the
FAO, OIE, and WHO arrived in the country on 6 Jan 2009 to provide technical
assistance through an investigation in the affected locations of Bulacan
and Pangasinan. The team of UN experts are comprised of epidemiologists,
laboratory specialists, veterinarians and food safety and public health and
risk communication experts.

At the same time, the international experts reiterated that eating pork is
safe because the said virus is not contagious to humans. In a statement
issued by them, they urged the consumers to purchase meat from National
Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) accredited outlets. Further, the pork should
be properly handled and cooked at a minimum of 70 DEG C [158 DEG F] because
most viruses, including ERV is quickly killed when heated.


Meanwhile, according to provincial veterinarian Dr Felipe Bartolome, only a
very small number of pigs from an estimated population of 4800 swines in
Pandi, Bulacan, were discovered to be affected. As a precautionary measure,
he added that the farm has already been in quarantine since 10 Dec 2008 and
local officials continue to monitor the developments to prevent the spread.

The detection of ERV in swine was confirmed in October [2008] after samples
of blood and tissues from 70 pigs in the province and 70 from Pangasinan
were submitted to the Bureau of Animal Industry for a series of tests then
later on sent to Plum Island in Atlanta [sic; should read New York. -
Mod.AS], USA, for further confirmation.

The Departments of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Health (DOH) will
continue to monitor the developments, provide regular updates and an exit
press conference will take place at the end of the mission to inform the
public about the outcome and recommendations of the team of experts.

[The Philippines, which constitutes an archipelago of 7107 islands with a
total land area of about 300 000 sq km (116 000 sq mile), is divided into 3
main island groups: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao; see map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/?action=selmap&country=236_0_4&language=1>.
From previous postings on the current Ebola-Reston event and from the
above 4 collected newswires, it appears that -- so far -- ERV infection has
been detected in 2 locations in Luzon, namely in Pandi and Talavera town
outside Manila. It will be interesting to note on what grounds/tests has
absence of infection been declared in Visayas (which includes Negros
Occidentale; see item 3 above) or in any other part of the vast Philippines
territory.

The above newswires reflect the endeavors of the authorities to address
consumer concerns on the safety of pork. The active involvement of the 3
international organisations in the investigation efforts of this event is
commendable. Details on the sampling criteria applied for the collection of
the 600 samples, sent to the CDC labs in Atlanta, Georgia, would be
helpful. Have samples been collected outside Luzon? It will be also
necessary to find out if the ERV infection in the pigs had clinical effect
or was subclinical, incidentally discovered when sampled from PRRS-affected
pigs were tested in the Plum Island laboratory. - Mod.AS]
