The Columbus Zoo and Aquarium says an elephant born 3 weeks ago has died. The zoo says the female Asian elephant died Wednesday [26 Dec 2018] after a sudden illness. The small female calf was only 20 days old.

The zoo's veterinary team says the elephant appeared sluggish Wednesday [26 Dec 2018] morning and was found to have an infection. The team gave her fluids, antibiotics and blood plasma from her mother. She initially seemed to rebound, but then her health declined again.

The zoo had not yet named the elephant who was born on 6 Dec 2018. It was the 1st elephant birth at the zoo in almost 10 years. The elephant was born to a 31-year-old Asian elephant named Phoebe who was artificially inseminated with sperm from 2 elephants, one at the Columbus zoo and one at another zoo.

The zoo is conducting a full necropsy (animal autopsy) to determine what happened, but the report won't be available for several weeks.

A month ago [30 Nov 2018], the Oregon Zoo reported the sudden death of elephant Lily [on ProMED-mail Herpesvirus, elephant - USA (02): (OR) fatal 20181207.6192539 and Herpesvirus, elephant - USA: (OR) fatality 20181202.6176860] -- a day before her 6th birthday. Veterinarian staff said she died of a sudden onset of endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), a rapidly progressing and often fatal disease. Elephant calves are particularly susceptible to it.

The Columbus Zoo President and CEO Tom Stalf released a statement: "At only a few weeks of age, this little calf had already won our hearts. She was a cherished member of our Zoo family, and we are mourning her passing. I have the privilege of working alongside amazing, compassionate and dedicated animal experts. Our team is going through an exceptionally difficult time with our recent unrelated losses, and we are appreciative of the outpouring of support we receive from near and far."

[This article appears to imply there is at least the suspicion of endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV). However, no definitive cause of death has been released. The necropsy results are still pending.

It is unknown at this time why some calves become ill from EEHV hemorrhagic disease and some calves are exposed to the virus without illness. Suspected factors include variations in calf immunity or viral virulence, with the cause likely being multifactorial. Treatment at this time includes antivirals and supportive care, such as rectal or IV fluids, and IV plasma transfusions. Early detection is key, before there are clinical signs, through weekly blood PCR testing. Early treatment, prior to clinical illness, is currently the only option for helping elephants survive hemorrhagic disease. A vaccine, if developed, would decrease severity of disease, but would not prevent transmission (extracted from ProMED-mail 20181207.6192539).

This calf was only 3 days old and may or may not have had a blood test looking for EEHV. Likely this will be in the report when more is known. - Mod.TG
