The avian influenza virus H5N1 could become entrenched in chickens
and domestic ducks and geese in parts of Europe, FAO warned today [25
Oct 2007]. The agency stressed that healthy domestic ducks and geese
may transmit the virus to chickens and play a more important role in
the persistence of the virus in the region than previously thought.
H5N1 surveillance in countries with significant domestic duck and
geese populations should be urgently increased. FAO's warning
followed the detection of H5N1 in diseased young domestic ducks by
German scientists.

"It seems that a new chapter in the evolution of avian influenza may
be unfolding silently in the heart of Europe," said FAO's Chief
Veterinary Officer, Joseph Domenech. "If it turns out to be true that
the H5N1 virus can persist in apparently healthy domestic duck and
geese populations, then countries need to urgently reinforce their
monitoring and surveillance schemes in all regions with significant
duck and geese production for the presence of H5N1. Europe should
prepare for further waves of avian influenza outbreaks, most probably
in an east-west direction, if the virus succeeds in persisting
throughout the year in domestic waterfowl. This heightens the need
for increased surveillance and monitoring of possible virus
circulation in domestic ducks and geese."

The link between domestic ducks and geese and chickens is seen by
many experts as one of the major underlying factors in outbreaks of
HPAI in disease-entrenched countries. "We are particularly concerned
about the Black Sea area, which has a high concentration of chickens,
ducks and geese," said FAO senior animal health officer Jan
Slingenbergh. "In the Ukraine alone, the number of domestic ducks is
estimated at around 20 million birds. In Romania, 4 million domestic
ducks and 4 million domestic geese are found in the Danube delta.
These figures compare easily with chicken and waterfowl densities in
Asia, where the virus continues to circulate among chickens and has
found a niche in countries with tens of millions of domestic ducks
and geese," Slingenbergh said.

Importantly, the Black Sea area serves as a main wintering area for
migratory birds coming from Siberia and moving also to the
Mediterranean and other regions. All countries bordering the Black
Sea have experienced outbreaks of avian influenza in the past,
favored by traditional open poultry systems with poor separation
between wild and domestic birds.

The link between the H5N1 virus and domestic ducks and geese has
recently been confirmed in Germany. Scientists of the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut in Riems detected the H5N1 virus in
diseased young ducks on a farm at the end of August 2007. Further
scrutiny at 2 other farms revealed that, despite the absence of
clinical signs and mortality in these ducks, the animals had been in
contact with the H5N1 virus, because their immune defense system
showed antibodies developed in response to the virus. Intensified
monitoring finally confirmed pockets of H5N1 on one of the farms.

Based on its experience in fighting avian influenza around the world
over the past 3 years, FAO considers that risk assessment,
surveillance and virus search strategies should be reviewed, Domenech
said. Countries with significant domestic duck and geese populations
in Western and Central Europe as well as the Black Sea region should
consider the incident in Germany as a wake-up call and should not
limit the virus search to chickens. Good surveillance is already in
place in many European countries, and the European Commission issued
in 2007 very comprehensive guidelines. But there are countries in
which more monitoring is urgently needed, including more focus on
ducks and geese, which should be considered as particularly risky
populations.

"It could well be that there is more virus circulation in Europe than
currently assumed," Slingenbergh said. "We are not saying that the
virus is widely spread in European countries; in fact, most of the
countries are currently virus-free. But undetected localized virus
spots in countries with significant waterfowl may pose a continuous
risk."

After Asia and Africa, Europe could become the 3rd continent in which
H5N1 could become endemic in some areas, FAO said.

[Going about finding H5N1 shedders in healthy domestic fowl is
tedious but not that complicated, though not inexpensive. If such
birds exist in wild populations and are meaningfully persistent, the
problem gets much more complex and becomes essentially unsolvable. -
