Swine fever, classical: suspected - UK (England) 20010415.0747
Date: 29 Apr 2001
From: "Trevor Drew" <tdrew.vla@gtnet.gov.uk>

There have been recent press reports of suspect classical swine fever
(CSF) cases in the UK, since the outbreak last year [2000, which
speculate a new outbreak may have occurred. There is no evidence of
that CSF is currently [2001 present in the UK.
Since the clinical signs of this disease are not pathognomonic, where
any suspicion exists, laboratory tests for CSF are routinely carried
out. In total, 18 suspect cases have been investigated in 2001, all
with negative results.
There are no outstanding results for any suspect cases. In addition to
these cases, an increased level of formal surveillance is also being
maintained in areas where the virus was present last year. Again,
there is no evidence of any infection.
Under EU legislation, the definitive test for CSF requires tissue
culture isolation, which takes 4 days from receipt. An RT-PCR test is
also performed on all suspect cases, which has proved 100% accurate
and has been used extensively during the year 2000 outbreak. This test
generally takes 1 day to provide a result, but has yet to be approved
by the EU for final confirmation, so all suspect cases must await the
results of virus isolation before a final report can be issued. For
the 18 suspect cases in 2001 received to date, which were all
negative, the mean time from receipt at VLA to issuing a final CSF
report is 4.28 days.
