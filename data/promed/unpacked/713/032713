After losing some 70 percent of its coconut palms due to a disease that decimated thousands of plants island-wide, the St Kitts Department of Agriculture has acquired over 3000 plants and will soon begin a replanting programme.

"We have been on the losing end of a battle with the 'Coconut Palm Complex' -- a complex because an affected tree may be infected by the red palm mite, lethal yellowing, and bud rot disease [all at one time]. More than 70 percent of the coconut stock was lost to this problem. However, the Ministry of Agriculture has responded," said Ashton Stanley, Ministry of Agriculture. "We have identified lands in the Shadwell Area for replanting coconut trees and additional lands will be identified island wide," he said.

[Bud rot (also called heart rot) of coconut palm can be caused by several species of fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_, as well as some fungi and bacteria. Different pathogens may be prevalent in different areas. The pathogens also affect other palms and are favoured by high rainfall. Trees of all ages can be affected and also become more susceptible to secondary insect or pathogen infestations and adverse environmental factors. Bud rot is one of the most serious diseases of palms. Symptoms may include wilting and death of young leaves; distorted older fronds; defoliation; stem end rot, discolouration and premature drop of nuts; and rotting of the growth bud ("heart" of the palm) leading to the death of the tree. The pathogens are spread by wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect activities), and with infected plant or other material. Disease management may include cultural practices, removal and burning of severely affected palms, and agrochemicals at or before onset of symptoms. Different palm varieties or hybrids may show different levels of susceptibility to bud rot.

Lethal yellowing (LY) diseases of coconut and other palms are caused by phytoplasmas of the palm lethal yellowing (LY or 16SrIV) group. A number of LY strains have been described from the Caribbean, Latin America, Africa, and southern Asia. LY has seriously jeopardised coconut industries in the respective areas. Symptoms include premature nut drop, blackening of inflorescences, yellowing of fronds, and death of the palm usually within 4 to 6 months. The planthopper _Myndus crudus_ is suspected to be the vector in the Americas, but different vectors may be involved in the spread of LY strains elsewhere. Seed transmission of the pathogens cannot be excluded and some weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Jumps of LY across apparently unaffected coconut populations have been observed, possibly due to aerial spread of infectious vector insects or human activities. Commercial control of LY relies on resistant varieties, but an unexplained resistance breakdown of some widely used hybrids (ProMED-mail post 20070522.1643) is causing great concern.

The red palm mite, _Raoiella indica_, is a serious pest of coconut and other palm species. It is spreading in the Caribbean and the American mainland. A combination of these 3 factors affecting coconut palms in St Kitts would be very difficult to control, and replanting alone may not eliminate the problem in the long run if the pathogens are still present on the island.
