Vaccinate livestock against anthrax now
----------------------------------------
Livestock producers should get their animals vaccinated for anthrax
now, especially if they are in areas with a history of the disease,
North Dakota State University Extension Service veterinarian Charlie
Stoltenow advises.

A case of anthrax has occurred in south-central North Dakota's Sioux
County. While the disease mainly has been reported in northeastern,
southeastern and south-central North Dakota, it has been found in
almost every part of the state, according to state animal health
officials. This is the 1st time a confirmed case of anthrax has been
found in Sioux County in several years, state veterinarian Susan Keller says.

Anthrax vaccine is effective, but it takes about a week to establish
immunity, and it must be administered annually because immunity
appears to wane after about 6 months, Stoltenow says. He recommends
producers check with their veterinarian to make sure their
livestock's vaccination schedule is adequate and the vaccination is up to date.

Livestock in areas where anthrax has been found should be vaccinated
about 4 weeks before the disease usually appears.

Herds within 6 miles of a prior case of anthrax also should be
vaccinated, especially in years with wet spring weather and/or flooding.

If anthrax is detected in a herd, producers should move the herd
immediately to a new pasture away from where dead animals were found
to prevent other animals from getting infected, Stoltenow says.

During severe outbreak conditions, animals that haven't been
vaccinated and are exposed to anthrax may have to be treated with
antibiotics and then vaccinated. Producers considering treating with
antibiotics should contact their veterinarian because antibiotics
decrease the effectiveness of the vaccine, Stoltenow says.

Anthrax is a concern because spores of the bacteria that cause it can
survive in the soil for decades. Cases of the disease develop in the
region almost every year. However, favorable conditions, such as
heavy rainfall, flooding or drought, may make it more widespread.

Producers should monitor their herds for unexpected deaths and report
them to their veterinarian, Stoltenow says.

Because anthrax also is a risk to humans, people should not move a
carcass. The carcasses of animals that died from anthrax should be
disposed of, preferably through burning, as close as possible to
where they died. Any contaminated soil should be piled on top of the
carcasses for burning, Stoltenow says.

This morning I spoke with Susan Keller, North Dakota State
Veterinarian, about this outbreak and she filled me in on it. While
they do not have a historical record documenting a prior case of
anthrax in Sioux County, there are ranchers in the county who have
provided anecdotal information of losses appearing to be from anthrax.

This event occurred inside an Indian reservation and therefore
outside her direct responsibility. It seems that there have been
multiple deaths: 3 cows have died and 2 of these had been ill for a
week or longer, which is very atypical of bovine anthrax; and there
were 7 calf deaths ditto. When the 7th calf died the carcass was
taken to a local veterinarian. Both partners were out on call but the
senior partner's wife, a technician, thought it might be anthrax,
took the necessary blood sample, and referred it to NDSU Fargo for examination.

The ranch in question is severely grazed down after a harsh winter,
and so poorly managed such that the cows had minimal milk -- this
index case had some grass but no milk in its stomach. Though there is
a risk of grass tetany the owner had provided the animals with no
minerals, and the calves had been seen licking the soil.

Therefore out of the 10 deaths how many had died of anthrax is
unclear. Minimally I would put it at the cow which died suddenly with
probably some blood extravasation, and this salty blood was licked by
one or more calves. I have seen bloody-soil licking by cows in an
anthrax outbreak in the UK some years ago.

The carcasses have been burnt in a shallow pit as per Charlie
Stoltenow's advice.

Vaccination of the reservation herds is now in hand and extensively
in the region, significantly further out than 6 miles. In North
Dakota there is a solid experience of annual anthrax vaccination,
especially in the eastern half of the state, with the result that
this disease is well controlled in those parts. 2005 was a harsh lesson.

The random sporadic cattle deaths in the reservation herds in recent
years have not been investigated but this would be indicative, until
there is contrary evidence, of an ongoing anthrax situation.

South Dakota has issued a parallel advisory to their ranchers to get
their livestock vaccinated against anthrax. They have had flooding
and heavy rains this spring.

Our heartfelt thanks to Susan for her briefing. Any errors are mine. - Mod.MHJ]
