Update: Ralstonia associated with Vapotherm oxygen delivery devices - USA, 2005
-----------------------------------------------
This report updates information on _Ralstonia_ species associated
with Vapothermoxygen delivery devices (Vapotherm Inc., Stevensville,
Maryland). CDC has obtained new information from a test developed by
CDC and performed by The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (PA,
USA) to assess the efficacy of the new chlorine dioxide disinfection
protocol recommended by Vapotherm. Although limited, this information
suggests that the new protocol for disinfecting Vapotherm devices and
cartridges might not achieve sustained bacterial control in certain
situations. At this time, the optimal protocol to disinfect machines
and cartridges that might contain very heavy biofilms is not known.

Before development of the new disinfection protocol in October 2005,
certain institutions had reported no growth of _Ralstonia spp_ in
samples obtained from machines and cartridges disinfected according
to the previous protocol. In addition, in an experiment conducted by
an independent laboratory contracted by Vapotherm, a
laboratory-generated biofilm (consisting of a mix of organisms) was
grown in a Vapotherm device and cartridge for 3 weeks. The device and
cartridge were then subjected to the new chlorine dioxide
disinfection protocol. Results from this trial revealed no growth
during the 4 days after disinfection.

However, in a single trial designed by CDC and involving one machine,
The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia subjected a Vapotherm device
and used filter cartridge to the new chlorine dioxide disinfection
protocol. The device and cartridge were known to be contaminated with
_Ralstonia spp_, and the unit had been out of service and not
disinfected for multiple weeks. Samples obtained immediately after
disinfection grew no organisms. The trial was initially designed to
run for 30 days; however, after 7 days of continuous operation of the
unit with no patient contact, samples from both the vapor condensate
and the filter cartridge grew _Ralstonia spp_ in culture at CDC.

Whether the presence of an unusually heavy biofilm in the machine and
cartridge in the hospital experiment resulted in the failure to
eradicate _Ralstonia spp_ is unknown. Similarly, the impact of
testing a laboratory-generated biofilm instead of a use-generated
biofilm is not known. The varying results achieved with the new
disinfection protocol might indicate that its efficacy depends on the
maturity of any biofilm contained within Vapotherm machines or
cartridges. Testing is being conducted by a private laboratory and
CDC to further assess the efficacy of and possible improvements to
the new disinfection protocol; CDC continues to search for the source
of _Ralstonia spp_ contamination in Vapotherm devices. Clinicians
should continue to weigh the potential risks for _Ralstonia spp_
contamination of Vapotherm devices against the benefits of using the
device in patients requiring humidified oxygen therapy.

Clinicians are encouraged to report findings of _Ralstonia spp_ in
patients using any Vapotherm 2000 respiratory gas administration
device directly to the device manufacturer, local or state health
departments, or CDC by telephone, 800-893-0485. Cases or any other
adverse events related to medical devices should be reported to
MedWatch, the Food and Drug Administration's voluntary reporting
program online at
<http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch>;
by telephone, 800-FDA-1088; by fax, 800-FDA-0178; or by mail,
