Anthrax-contaminated meat has found its way into stores in Varna and Dobrich (Northeast Bulgaria), said Varna Deputy Regional Governor Tsvetomir Petrov after a meeting of the crisis task force late Wed [22 Jul 2015]. According to him, the samples taken from the equipment and counter tops at a meat processing shop in Varna have tested positive for anthrax.

A man died in a Varna hospital a few days ago [probably sometime between 13 & 15 Jul 2015 - Mod.MHJ] from an anthrax infection. He was infected while processing the meat of an infected cow or eating it undercooked. According to the Health Inspectorate, the cow was slaughtered on 7 Jul [2015] in the village of Mlada Gvardiya, after it got sick. An anthrax [source?] was reported in the village. A subsequent investigation found that infected meat and parts from the animal's carcass had been sold, resold and processed in a few locations.

It was believed until now that acquaintances of the dead man from the village of Mlada Gvardiya had taken the meat to the butcher shop in order to make sausages for personal consumption. The shop's owner, however, firmly denied having processed such meat. According to Petrov, the surfaces in the meat processing shop were in contact with other meats as well, which were processed after the anthrax-contaminated meat, and this has led to secondary contamination.

All measures have been taken for finding and isolating the meat products that could have possibly been contaminated by anthrax [sic, _Bacillus anthracis_, not the disease 'anthrax'. - Mod.MHJ] in the region of Dobrich, the northeastern city's Regional Governor Dr. Margarita Novoselska said Wednesday evening. The shipments have been pinpointed, as well as the people who had traded them. Their stores have been shut, she said. The results from the samples taken are still to come, Novoselska added.

The Dobrich Regional Governor explained that the people who have consumed the products in question over the previous few days have also been identified. They have been tested and none has shown anthrax symptoms. According to her, this is grounds to believe that the risk of contamination is very small.

Food Safety Agency employees are currently recalling unspecified quantities of meat from stores. As of late Wed [22 Jul 2015] it was still not known exactly how many stores have been supplied with meat from the contaminated butcher shop. What is known is that these stores are in Varna, Dobrich and the town of Byala and that the meat has been ground and put into meatballs, sausages and other ground meat products.

The meat processing plant's owner is currently being questioned by the police.

"Strengthened measures have been imposed over anthrax positive tested surfaces of the appliances in a slaughterhouse in Varna." That is what Minister of Agriculture and Food, Desislava Taneva, told journalists, a reporter of FOCUS News Agency announced. "Precautionary measures have been taken against possible risk in the retail stores, which hadn't been in touch with the infected meat," the Minister said.

Desislava Taneva specified that the anthrax-diseased animal was slaughtered on 7 Jul 2015. "The disease was confirmed after the death of the farmer who [had] slaughtered the animal. The farmer slaughtered a sick animal. A private practitioner veterinarian [had] not been informed that there was a sick animal. The animal was slaughtered at night and then was given to other persons absolutely illegally," she said.

According to her, the response was delayed because neither the farmer nor the veterinary doctor met their obligation to inform the respective authorities on the case. "Absolutely all measures were taken immediately after the news about the disease emerged."

Now all retail stores, restaurants and meat shops in the district [are being inconvenienced], as they haven't sold or were supplied meat from diseased animals. However, they all have been closed for disinfection," she said. "The reason for these more stringent measures and closing off the sites were positive samples from the surface of the equipment in the cutting plant," the Minister specified.

[Before someone corrects me, "anthrax" is the disease, _Bacillus anthracis_ is the aetiologic pathogen causing the disease. Folks get careless using the former to cover both subjects.

But having said that, I for one am very impressed by 2 things to do with this incident. The thoroughness and speed of the government response and the quick reporting by the Bulgarian news agencies. Unfortunately not too common on either score these days for many of us. Once I saw that sausages and meatballs were involved, it was clear that there would be contamination spread through mincing and mixing the meat and viscera. If you go to either of the first 2 articles above, there are pictures of the different sausages. Minister Taneva and her people are to be commended. - Mod.MHJ
