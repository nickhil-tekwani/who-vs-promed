The Western Cape government placed restrictions on horse movement in
the province on Wednesday [2 Mar 2011], following an outbreak of
African horse sickness [AHSV] in some parts of the country.

More than 90 cases have been confirmed with over 50 deaths this
season, but none have been reported in the province.

Agriculture spokesperson Wouter Kriel offered advice for horse
owners. "What horse owners can do is to stable their horses overnight
or to move them to high-lying areas 2 hours before sunset or until 2
hours after sunset. This is the time during the day where the virus is
most contagious" [we would rather suggest to replace "the virus is
most contagious" by "the vector-midge is active." - Mod.AS].
