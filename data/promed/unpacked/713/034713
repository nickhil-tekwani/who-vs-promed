Residents [of Arivonimamo district, Itasy region, Madagascar] are worried about an unidentified disease that has attacked cattle for nearly 3 days. Four municipalities in this district are currently affected by this disease -- Miantsoarivo, Ambohipandrano, Ambohimandry and Miandrandra.

In one of these towns, around 30 bovids had unusual symptoms. "The cattle do not eat; the oxen have viral diarrhea [see comment]. They become thin and their condition worsens," said Nomenjanahary Randria√πampionona, chief of the Municipality of Ambohipandrano. Complaints from residents are linked to the town hall of Ambohipandrano, a town located 28 km [17.4 mi] from Imerintsiatosika.

"I have received nearly 30 complaints about this disease since Sunday [21 Nov 2021]. The inhabitants fear the worst. Being myself an ox breeder, 3 of my cattle have had symptoms and I cannot do anything," laments the mayor. Since Sunday, veterinarians have come to examine the animals to see this disease firsthand.

No name [for the illness/disease] has yet been put forward by the technicians. "We rule out the theory of Rift Valley fever (RVF) for the moment, but we are not yet sure about this new disease. What we can say is that the treatment carried out had positive effects on sick animals," said a veterinarian on the phone yesterday [24 Nov 2021]. An analysis will be carried out on samples. The results of this analysis will be expected shortly.

[The symptoms of the unidentified illness, affecting cattle in multiple locations in the district of Arivonimamo, Itasy region, are anorexia, diarrhea and emaciation. No information on mortality is given, nor on morbidity rate, age distribution, application of centralized feed supply to the affected farms, and on the health situation in other animal species kept on the same premises, as well as in humans.

Diarrhea can be caused by various factors, infectious (for example, bacteria, viruses, helminths, protozoa) and noninfectious (bacterial toxins, mycotoxins, diet-related, chemicals). It is not clear on what the cited information about "viral diarrhea" was based. If an (unspecified) treatment has "positive effect," viruses are not likely to be the etiology. If diarrhea-causing viruses are indeed suspected, relevant candidates -- for example, rinderpest virus (an eradicated lethal disease of cattle) and bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), should be excluded.

Rift Valley fever (RVF), a zoonotic disease which has been recorded several times in Madagascar in livestock and humans, including earlier this year (2021), is not characterised by diarrhea. Its main manifestations in cattle are fever, anorexia, weakness, abortion and death of juveniles.

Results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigation are requested. - Mod.AS
