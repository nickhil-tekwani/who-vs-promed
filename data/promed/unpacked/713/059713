El Salvador Ministry of Health last Wednesday announced a preventive
state of yellow alert, because of an increase in the number of dengue
fever cases in San Salvador, La Libertad, and Sonsonate Departments,
according to an official spokesman. So far, 2456 cases of classic
dengue fever and 76 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been
reported in El Salvador.
The alert was issued for San Salvador, La Libertad, and Sonsonate
Departments, in the southwestern part of the country, pointed out Dr.
Jose Guillermo Maza, Ministry of Health.
According to statistics cited by Dr. Maza, patient admissions because
of dengue fever increased from 60 cases per week in June 2006 to 111
during the 1st week of July [2006]. The most affected age group is
children less than 12 years old. "So far we have 2435 cases of
classic dengue fever and 76 cases of DHF throughout the country for
the first 6 months of 2006," pointed out Dr. Maza. For the same time
period in 2005, 2189 cases of classic dengue fever were reported.
The Ministry of Health urged the population to destroy larval
breeding sites and mosquitoes in water receptacles, and its personnel
have been delivering insecticidal compounds. Mr. Ricardo Lara, head
of the state-run program FOSALUD, indicated that 60 "anti-dengue"
healthcare providers will be hired. These people will work in the 3
departments where the yellow alert has been issued. Additionally,
Mr. Lara commented that fumigation efforts performed by specialized
teams of field healthcare workers "will be intensified" in the mostly
affected areas. Military Sanitation personnel will also join the
fumigation campaign.

Jambi's health office reported Saturday an outbreak of the most
severe form of dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever in the
municipality. Of the 77 people infected, 4 have died, said the head
of the office's communicable diseases division, M. Syafei. The
deceased victims were all under the age of 20.
"We have to raise people's awareness about dengue," said Syafei.
According to the health office, of the 353 people who got dengue
hemorrhagic fever in 2005, 11 died. In 2004, 275 people contracted
the insect-borne viral infection and 4 died.

Dengue cases increased in 2006, but the Ministry of Health points out
that there was a reduction in hemorrhagic cases and in case-fatality rates.
From January to June 2006, 198 922 dengue cases were reported in
Brazil, with a rise in 12 states relative to the same period 2005:
Pernambuco, Sergipe, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, Rio de Janeiro,
Sao Paulo, Parana, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso do
Sul, Mato Grosso and Goias, as well as the Federal District (Brasilia).
There was a reduction in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases in 2006
when compared to the same period in 2005, with 278 reported cases and
23 deaths, a case-fatality of 8.3 percent. From January to June 2005,
there were 463 reported DHF cases and 45 deaths, a case-fatality of
9.7 percent. The serotypes isolated were DEN-1, DEN-2 & DEN-3, as in
the previous years. There has been no report of DEN-4.
The state with the highest number of DHF cases was Ceara (in the
Northeast), with 84 cases. Espirito Santo (Southeast) had the
highest case-fatality rate, 26.1 percent, with 15 cases and 6 deaths.
Amapa, Amazonas, Federal District, Para, Paraiba, Roraima and Sergipe
have not reported DHF.

[This report was made by the Ministry of Health on 14 Jun 2006. These
numbers are much lower than the more than 800 000 cases in 2002 but
rather close to the more than 240 000 in 2005. As always, official
reports tend to show the lighter aspects. DHF reporting in Brazil is
irregular and is more active in areas with more experience in
diagnosis, like Ceara and Rio de Janeiro; the slight decrease in DHF
cases and case-fatality is questionable. The decrease in cases does
not automatically reflect the impact of control measures. Dengue in
Brazil, as elsewhere, oscillates, with a peak approximately every 5
years. More detailed data can be found at:

A Brazilian man died of dengue fever near Rio de Janeiro, the 3rd
victim of the deadly hemorrhagic form of the disease in 2006, but
authorities said on Monday the outbreak had fizzled out.
"The case surprised us, but the epidemic is over; the number of cases
in Rio de Janeiro state has been falling sharply after the peak in
February and March," said Aloysio Ribeiro, head of Rio State
Epidemiological Surveillance Center.
The number of dengue cases between January and mid-July [2006],
mainly in the tourist city of Rio de Janeiro & resort towns of Angra
and Parati, soared to more than 10 times the number from the same
period a year earlier to over 26 700, raising fears of a repeat of
the 2002 dengue epidemic which killed more than 100.
But Ribeiro said while in May 2006 nearly 3400 people contracted
dengue in the state, the number of new cases fell to 675 in June and
continued to fall in July, including in the town of Mage across the
Guanabara Bay from Rio, where a 24-year-old mechanic died [of DHF] on Sunday.
Health officials said with lower temperatures during the southern
hemisphere winter, mosquitoes that transmit dengue were becoming
fewer and less active. That, combined with anti-dengue efforts by the
state, gave them hope an outbreak could be avoided in 2007.
Other Brazilian states have not been seriously affected by dengue
fever in 2006.
Larvae of mosquitoes [that transmit dengue] breed in stagnant water
collected anywhere from abandoned swimming pools to empty flower pots
and car tires. Anti-dengue measures include inspections of private
property to dispose of any stagnant water and spraying of entire
urban areas with insecticide.

The City Health Office (CHO) has registered an increase in the number
of dengue cases for the first half of 2006. A report of the CHO said
that from just over 100 from January to July 2005, dengue cases in
2006 rose to 247 with one death. It also revealed that up from 32
affected barangays [neighborhoods] in 2005, 77 were affected this year.
The report was based on weekly admissions in city hospitals, which
showed that the number of admissions in 2006 is higher than in 2005.
Among the barangays [neighborhoods] affected by dengue were those in
Camp 8, Camp 7, Upper Quezon Hill,Fairview, Dagsian, & Engineer's Hill.
The CSO, through its Epidemiological Services Unit (ESU), is closely
monitoring barangays Camp 7, Camp 8, Dagsian, and Santa. Escholastica
following reports that dengue fever has spread in those areas.
With this trend, the CSO recommended a citywide clean-up as soon as
the rains subside, larval survey in high risk areas, a massive
information campaign, and thermal fogging in the barangays of City
Camp, Engineer's Hill & Fairview.

The torrential rain has caused the Kaohsjung dengue-infected mosquito
index to be on the high side. As a part of a public awareness
campaign, the health bureau of Kaohsiung municipal government calls
upon citizens to eliminate mosquito breeding grounds. The first
indigenous dengue case was discovered on 6 Jul 2006. Subsequently, 6
additional cases were detected in the city, amounting to a total of 7
indigenous dengue cases to date, which include 5 in Qianzeng and 2 in
Qianjin districts. All the cases were reported using the reporting
mechanism in place through local hospitals and health stations.
Ovitrap surveillance of dengue mosquitoes has been carried out
between 15 Jun and 12 Jul 2006. It has shown that the dengue mosquito
index was unusually high. Approximately 92 per cent of the tested
areas were over the threshold and at alarming levels.
The health bureau reminds the clinicians, especially those in
infested districts, to look out for any suspected cases of dengue
fever, either of local origin or of importation through overseas
travel. Should these happen, the clinicians must inform the health
authorities. The former will be awarded a sum of 10 000 NTD (or 330
USD) and a certificate of merit, as an encouragement. Such incentives
are applicable for the first 20 cases only. [This is an
extraordinary measure, open to abuse unless it refers to
lab-confirmed cases. - Mod.JW].
