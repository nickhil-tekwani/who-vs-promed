La Crosse Virus Infection May Be Missed in Children
---------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: New findings suggest that a sometimes serious mosquito-borne virus
[infection may be more common and more severe in children than previously
believed. The ailment, known as La Crosse encephalitis, [is manifested as
headache, fever and disorientation. In extreme cases, it can lead to
seizures, brain swelling [encephalitis and death. Many cases of the disease
may be mistakenly diagnosed as meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes
covering the brain or spinal cord) or other types of encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain), according to a report in the 15 Mar 2001 issue
of The New England Journal of Medicine
The disease was first identified in 1965 in a 4-year-old from La Crosse
County, Wisconsin, and has since been found in 28 states. The virus is
transmitted via a "tree-hole" mosquito and is largely found in states with
hardwood forests east of the Mississippi river. According to Dr. James E.
McJunkin and colleagues at the University in Charleston, West Virginia, La
Crosse encephalitis may be under-recognized not only in terms of its
prevalence but also in terms of its severity, The researchers closely
examined 127 children aged 6 months to 15 years who were hospitalized with
the virus infection around Charleston, West Virginia, during a 10-year
period. The investigators found that 15 children (12 percent) left the
hospital
with some neurological problems, such as poor balance, memory difficulties
or speech problems. When the researchers looked at a subset of children over
5 with a severe case of the illness, they found that 15 out of 25 had signs
of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder a year after they left the
hospital. Of 28 children 10 had IQ scores indicating borderline or mental
retardation.
The authors estimate that the virus infects 20 to 30 children per 100 000
youngsters under 15 years of age in West Virginia, an incidence similar to
states in the Midwest. Dr. James Meegan from the National Institutes for
Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health
suggests that changing environments may end up causing more people to be at
risk for mosquito-borne ailments. This may be due to urban environments that
provide the stagnant water in containers or tires that mosquitoes need to
breed. "We have been, as a culture, increasing the number of sites where
mosquito can breed," Meegan said. While La Crosse encephalitis is not always
serious, children should avoid areas where mosquitos [are present, wear
insect repellent and long sleeves, and avoid walking in the early morning
and early evening when mosquitos are most active.

Wisconsin, in 1960. - Mod.CP
