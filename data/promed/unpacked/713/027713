Dumfries dealer jailed over anthrax heroin
------------------------------------------
A court has heard how a woman ended up in hospital in Dumfries after buying
heroin from a dealer who was unaware it was contaminated with anthrax.
Sheriff Kenneth Ross said he accepted that Darren Scott, 24, had not known
the drug was infected.

Scott admitted supplying heroin at the Lochside and Lincluden housing
estates in Dumfries between September last year [2009] and the end of March
[2010]. He was jailed at the town's sheriff court for a total of 4 years.

Depute fiscal Pamela Rhodes said Scott's dealing came to light during a
police operation following a number of anthrax cases among heroin users.
The court heard the total value of drugs passing through his hands had a
street value of up to GBP 20 000 [approx USD 32 000].

Solicitor Liz Dougan said that Scott, described as a prisoner in Dumfries,
had developed a cocaine habit and had agreed to become involved with the
heroin to write off a debt of about GBP 1000 [approx USD 1600].

[Reading between the lines of what the Sheriff says, there is a good chance
that, on tracing back from the Dumfries heroin patient, and presumably
others, they found this involuntary dealer and his stash. If so they would
have had the opportunity of analysing that stash. If it were contaminated,
much would have been learnt from it. Of course this is all speculation. All
in all there were 6 cases in the Dumfreis & Galloway area with no deaths.
