Indonesia: New Suspected Human Case
---------------------------------------------
Indonesian doctors said on Sunday [8 Jan 2006] that they were
treating a 29-year-old woman believed to be suffering from avian
influenza, which has so far killed at least 11 people across the country.
The patient was admitted to Jakarta's Sulianto Saroso hospital early
on Sunday [8 Jan 2006] after falling ill with pneumonia-like symptoms
on Thursday [5 Jan 2006], said hospital spokesman Ilham Patu. Patu
told AFP that the woman had been in contact with her neighbor's
chickens in her east Jakarta home earlier this week. Doctors were
conducting tests to determine whether she was carrying the H5N1 virus.
At least 11 people have died of avian influenza in Indonesia. 6 other
human cases have been confirmed as H5N1-virus-infected, but the
patients have either recovered or are still being treated.
Patu said local tests on a man who died earlier this week [1st week
January 2006], which confirmed that he had died of bird flu, were to
be sent to a Hong Kong laboratory accredited by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on Monday [9 Jan 2006]. If the case is confirmed
by the Hong Kong laboratory, the man would be Indonesia's 12th
fatality from the H5N1 virus, which has killed at least 70 [now 75]
people across Asia since 2003. The results are expected to be
released by Thursday [12 Jan 2006], Patu said.
Indonesia, the world's 4th most populous nation, has been accused of
covering up initial outbreaks of bird flu. Most victims in the
archipelago nation have so far hailed from densely populated Jakarta
and its surrounds, where many people live in close proximity to
poultry, providing ideal conditions for the virus to pass to humans.
