[Infection with infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus means infection with the pathogenic agent Salmonid novirhabdovirus (also known as infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus [IHNV]) of the genus _Novirhabdovirus_ and family Rhabdoviridae.

Infection with IHNV is endemic and widely prevalent among populations of free-ranging salmonids throughout much of its historical range along the west coast of North America. The virus has also become established with a high prevalence of infection in major trout growing regions of North America, Europe, and Asia where IHNV was introduced through the movement of infected fish or eggs.

Infection with IHNV has been detected in North America, Asia, and Europe, but not in the southern hemisphere. Countries reporting confirmed or suspect cases of infection with IHNV to the OIE include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, China (People's Rep. of), Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and United States of America. Infections and overt disease have been reported among fish reared in both fresh and sea water (https://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_ihn.htm). - Mod.CRD
