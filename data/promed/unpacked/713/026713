In a follow-up on the monkeypox outbreak in Bambari district, Central African Republic (CAR), a total of 8 cases with no deaths have been reported as of [25 Mar 2018] since the start of the outbreak.

CAR Ministry of Health declared an outbreak on [17 Mar 2018] in the sub-district of Ippy. Of these cases, 4 of 8 (50 percent) were male; all cases were over 5 years of age. As of [25 Mar 2018], 3 patients were hospitalized.

Laboratory samples were collected from all patients and have been tested by Institut Pasteur in Bangui and 6 of the 8 suspected cases have tested positive for monkeypox virus. One contact of a case developed suspicious lesions and laboratory confirmation is pending.

Monkeypox is a largely self-limiting disease i.e. a disease that resolves itself. Generalized vesicular [pustular] skin rashes, fever, and painful jaw swelling are characteristic symptoms associated with an infection. Although there is no specific medicine to treat the disease, when intensive supportive care is provided virtually all patients recover fully, as we have seen with the current outbreak.

People at risk for monkeypox are those who get bitten by an infected animal or if you have contact with the animal's rash, blood or body fluids. It can also be transmitted person to person through respiratory or direct contact and contact with contaminated bedding or clothing.

[It is good to learn that there has been timely laboratory support and confirmation of these cases as monkeypox (MPX). Except for the suspected contact case, the above report provides no information about the situation how the other 7 cases became infected. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. - Mod.TY
