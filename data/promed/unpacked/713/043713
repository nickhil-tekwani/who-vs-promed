The rebuttal issues raised after the initial post are quite relevant.
There are many issues regarding the entire field of WMD and many
examples of the loss of institutional memory and reinventing the
wheel.
Further, not only are the points about the paper being wrapped etc.
perfectly accurate, there are other questions as well. The primary
question is what makes small particulates cling to surfaces as
described in the original posting? The answer is electrostatic
attraction. However, reports regarding the anthrax spores in
Washington, DC, the Brentwood and Hamilton Township, indicated that
[those] spores had been treated with an antistatic agent.
As such, the findings in Florida raise more questions then they
answer. If these spores were treated with an antistatic agent, they
would not readily stick to any surface. If they were not treated,
even the fans in a copy machine would have a difficult time
aerosolizing the spores (the same way in which wind has a difficult
time aerosolizing dust off the hood of a car).
Additionally, if the Florida spores were not treated, what caused
their dispersion? Again, if the Florida spores were not treated and
the Washington, DC spores were, does this imply 2 different sources
or one source doing research? This situation just keeps getting more
curious all the time.

In the NEJM's report on the index case for last fall's anthrax cases,
on the last page of this document is the statement:
"Coworkers report that the patient had closely examined a suspicious
letter containing powder on September 19, approximately 8 days before
the onset of illness. (This incubation period is highly plausible,
given the modal incubation period of 10 days reported in the
Sverdlovsk outbreak.)"
Index case of fatal inhalational anthrax due to bioterrorism in the
United States. Larry M. Bush, M.D.,Barry H. Abrams, M.D., Anne Beall,
B.S.,M.T., & Caroline C. Johnson, M.D. N Engl J Med,Vol. 345 no. 22,
November 29,2001.
I don't remember ever seeing or hearing anything about this [letter
powder] from any other source.

[Unfortunately the little information we have comes from journalists
in Florida and not from the FBI, who have a crime scene investigation
going, not research. And the information was not quantitative. How
many spores make a contaminated copier? Is this modified by which
part or parts are "contaminated"? As copiers have fans, could the
copiers then be merely screening devices, indicating that the room
was air-contaminated? How does this information interact with the
presence or absence of spores in the air supply, the venting of each
room, and the geography of the building ventilation? Earlier reports
from Florida were that the spore preparation was of a different
coarser quality ("brown") than those seen elsewhere. Does this latter
statement still hold up?
This would seem to be a good point to cut this thread, as there is
little more to be learnt at this time. - Mod.MHJ]
