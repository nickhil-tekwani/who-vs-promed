I am a staff internist at the VA in Dallas and reserve flight surgeon for
the 136 MDS-- we see a great number of patients in our VA outpatient
facility on a daily basis (approximately 150 walk-ins), and thus far, there
has not been a "trend" towards any pneumonic process in general.
The information is very interesting, however, and I plan to share it with
the other staff members.

The recent discussion of _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ outbreaks captured my
attention. I am a medical epidemiologist with the U.S. Navy with an
interest in acute respiratory disease. _M. pneumoniae_ was first recognized
among ill military personnel and remains a common pathogen among our
healthy young trainees. Some studies have shown that as many as 57% of
U.S. military recruits have evidence of acute infection during training and
as much as 56% of recruit pneumonias are due to _M. pneumoniae_.
In collaboration with the University of Alabama at Birmingham, we recently
found that _M. pneumoniae_ causes 36% of pneumonias among U.S. Marines in
Southern California (Mil Med 1997;162:524-526). The CDC recently
investigated a _M. pneumoniae_ outbreak at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy
where they estimated 70% of the freshman class had clinical symptoms of
recent infection (35th IDSA, abstract 37).
Because of this morbidity, we have explored possible antibiotic
interventions during such epidemics. Oral azithromycin holds some promise
among military adults. We recently found by serology that 500mg weekly of
oral azithromycin had a protective efficacy against _M. pneumoniae_ of 64%
(95% CI 25-83) (Clin Infect Dis 1998;26:103-110). We continue to explore
strategies to control _M. pneumoniae_ among our high risk populations.
Some years ago oxytetracycline was studied with some success as a
prophylactic intervention (Am J Epidemiol 1967;86:419-432), however, the
frequent dosing was impractical. Additionally, a number of immunological
studies and vaccine trials were conducted in the 1960s and 1970s.
These and other references predate some electronic databases and are not
easily found. We have collected many of these older references, some dated
back to 1938, in a bibliography which I am happy to share with ProMED-mail
readers if they will contact me with their electronic mail and postal
address. As we continue to recognize _M. pneumoniae_ as a cause of acute
respiratory epidemics and subsequently a risk factor for chronic disease,
such references may be useful in developing strategies for prevention.

I work at an urgent-care medical facility with 6 sites in the Peoria,
Illinois area. Through the summer of this year, we have had an ongoing
presence of pneumonia, usually with atypical presentations. Several of them
have had little more than a pauci-productive cough, and have been picked up
only by routinely ascultating the chest. They have been predominantly
lobar in distribution, both by clinical exam and on radiologic evaluation.
Unfortunately, we have not cultured the majority of them, nor done acute
and convalescent titers; the nature of the clinics make it difficult to get
that kind of diagnostic study. However, a significant proportion of them
have not responded well to antibiotics of the penicillin and cephalosporin
classes, but responded fairly promplty to macrolides, tetracyclines or
floroquinolones. We conjecture that this represents one of the atypical
pneumonias, perhaps _Mycoplasma_ spp.

_M. pneumoniae_ infections is fairly common among otherwise healthy
