Breaking news on the evening of 23 Jun 2022 was of a possible outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Norfolk [England]. This is a notifiable disease and so government vets are investigating.

Many of us still remember the massive outbreak in 2001 and the pyres of burning livestock as the government of the time tried to control the disease. Are we facing that again? Or is the outlook more hopeful?

- What has happened?
Vets on a pig farm near Feltwell, Kings Lynn in Norfolk reported the existence of a suspected vesicular disease. This is a family of diseases that cause fluid-filled blisters or "vesicles" to form on the feet or mouth. The most infamous of these diseases is of course foot and mouth disease; however, other possible causes include vesicular stomatitis and swine vesicular disease.

- Will it be like 2001 all over again?
We're all hoping not. It looks like the local vets have picked this up really early, so hopefully, whatever it is, can be contained. In addition, we have learned a lot about disease control in the last 20 years, and generally, farm biosecurity is much, much better.

A spokesperson for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [Defra] said that while preliminary testing did not indicate the presence of disease, "further work is now under way to fully rule it out".

[It appears that the suspicion has, so far, not been confirmed. The final tests reaults at Pirbright's WRLFMD are expected soon, hopefully excluding FMD.

In case confirmed, vaccination vs stamping out might become a matter for discussion. Pigs are known as notorious amplifiers of the FMD virus.
