Although I am not involved in investigating the current die-off of
waterfowl on the Bow River in Calgary, I can offer some comment about
previous waterfowl losses that were investigated by the now closed
Animal Health Laboratory of Alberta Agriculture in Airdrie (located
just north of Calgary).
The Bow River remains at least partly open during most winters in
Calgary. As a result, a non-migratory resident population of
waterfowl has developed. In years with mild winters, this is not a
problem. However, in winters that are colder than average, the amount
of open water is reduced as the ice cover of the river increases.
Consequently, the waterfowl population is crowded into a smaller
area, and food supply becomes a limiting factor. The result is often
seen in emaciated waterfowl late in the winter. A cold snap in late
February will result in a die-off.
The present winter in the province of Alberta has had 2 months of
below average temperatures, and we are currently in the middle of a
week of below average temperatures with snowfall. It is possible that
the waterfowl population on the Bow River is exhibiting the effects
of starvation rather than infectious disease.

[Starvation in winter is always a possibility, especially in crowded
conditions. Thank you Dr. Nation for bringing us more local information.
We are still waiting on official test results. - Mod.TG]
