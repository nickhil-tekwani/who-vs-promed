The Dept. of Environment and Natural Resources continues to battle an
outbreak of anthrax in bison in the Slave River Lowlands. Officials
have now found 37 carcasses in the region, up from 7 found in late June 2010.

A spokesperson with ENR, Judy McLinton, says that every day, crews
are taking measures to contain the outbreak. "Once a carcass is
found, we have a team go in, and the site where the bison carcass is
found is treated with formaldehyde as well as the carcass," she said.
"And part of that is to just make sure that scavengers can't get at
it or get anthrax as well."

She says disposal teams then go in and burn the carcasses; on
average, they're dealing with 3 dead bison a day in the Slave River
Lowlands. She says they continue to do surveillance flights over the
lowlands and the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary.

Typically, ENR crews monitor the area until mid-August, as bison
contract anthrax during the hot summer months when they wallow in the
sand and inhale spores contaminated with the bacteria. [I wish it was
as easy as this, because if it were so, all they would have to do is
disinfect each wallow. - Mod.MHJ]

There have been 14 outbreaks of anthrax in the Slave River Lowlands
and Wood Buffalo National Park between 1962 and 2007.

Operations are normal, just treating and burning as fast as we can;
it is actually 38 carcasses as of late yesterday [13 Jul 2010].

There is no cluster per se, but there are 2 hot spots (extreme north
and south ends) with carcasses spread out in between -- they are
spread all over the Hook Lake range -- east of the Slave River.

[Our thanks to Troy. While those on the ground may make light of
their skills, I would ask our members to consider the actual
situation with 38 sites: One or 2 with new freshly dead; those
treated with formaldehyde awaiting burning; others under bonfire
construction; fires burning; and fires out/old dealt-with carcasses;
trying to make sense of it; and look for any new dead carcasses and
any missed carcasses, all of which is a complex and very demanding situation.

With carcasses spread out like this, and even allowing for the
ambling abilities of wood bison, it strikes me that biting flies are
the major culprit. And so far, it is not unlike the 1993 epidemic in
the Mackenzie Sanctuary. Normally, such epidemics last around 3
weeks, maybe 10 percent of the exposed bison will die, and some 90
percent of the survivors will have significant serological evidence
of subclinical infections. The good news is that, thanks to the
efficient handling of the '93 epidemic (all but a handful of the 175+
carcasses were burnt) and the immunological protection provided, the
disease has not been seen since in that sanctuary. And maybe the
Slave River Lowlands herds will similarly benefit from this 2010
epidemic. - Mod.MHJ]
