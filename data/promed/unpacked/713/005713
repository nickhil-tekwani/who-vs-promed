Fowl plague suspected in Bree
-----------------------------
A rapid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has detected fowl plague
[highly pathogenic avian influenza - HPAI] in a poultry farm with about 21
000 chickens in the municipality of Bree. The farm, as well as 5 other
poultry farms in the new protection zone (3 km), will be depopulated. This
is a total of about 100 000 birds. Non-commercial holdings will be culled
as well, within a 1 km radius.

Belgium discovers fourth case of suspected bird flu
---------------------------------------------------
A fourth suspected case of the highly contagious bird flu was detected on a
Belgian farm near the Netherlands border and just a few miles away from
previous outbreaks, a food safety agency spokesman said on Tue [22 Apr 2003].
"There's a new case of bird flu in the city of Bree," food safety agency
(AFSCA) spokesman Pascal Houbaert told Reuters. All 21 000 chickens on the
farm will be slaughtered as well as poultry within a 3 km (1.9 mile) radius
of the affected farm, which lies between 2 other sites where bird flu was
discovered last week.
This could amount to 120 000 birds in addition to the 500 000 Belgium has
already destroyed, after the first case of the disease was discovered in
the eastern region of Limburg last Wednesday.
Avian flu has spread into Belgium from its neighbor the Netherlands -- the
EU's biggest poultry exporter -- where some 11 million birds have been
slaughtered since the end of February 2003 in an effort to control the
spread of the disease. [The official Dutch figure, as of 22 Apr 2003, is 18
million culled birds - Mod.AS].
Infected birds display symptoms of depression, a halt in egg laying, a loss
of appetite, and swelling and discoloration of combs.
Last week a Dutch vet died from pneumonia after working on a farm infected
with the virus. Since the vet's death, Belgium has stepped up its public
health controls, vaccinating all staff working on infected farms and
requiring staff to take antiviral drugs.
Belgium has banned exports of live chickens and eggs and briefly halted
transport of all poultry products within the country. The European Union
has enforced the ban at an EU level until Friday, but a European Commission
(EC) spokeswoman said the current ban would probably be extended.
Officials said the EC had planned to hold talks with veterinary officials
from Belgium, the Netherlands, and most likely Germany on Tuesday. EU
veterinary experts will meet to discuss the crisis on Wednesday.

[All 4 current outbreaks in Belgium are adjacent to the Dutch border. Bree
is situated about 5 km north east of Meeuwen, where the first Belgian
outbreak was detected last week, and 10 km to the west of Kinrooi, where
the second and third outbreaks were reported on Sun, 20 Apr 2003.
More detailed information on the Belgian policy regarding vaccination and
preventive medication of persons engaged with HPAI-infected or suspected
poultry could be useful. As recently experienced in the Netherlands, all
those involved should be clearly instructed, and given adequate background
information, especially regarding the safety of antiviral drugs. - Mod.AS]
