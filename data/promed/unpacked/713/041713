RINDERPEST - TANZANIA
=====================

Date: Fri, 21 March 1997
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>
Sources:OIE, and various sources

After being reported as a suspicion to the OIE in mid-February, rinderpest
has been confirmed in Maasai cattle in a village overlooking Ngorongoro
Crater in north-central Tanzania. There are an estimated 10 million
unvaccinated cattle in the immediate vicinity.
This outbreak was preceded by one that began in Oct/Now 1996 in Nairobi
National Park, Kenya, killing numerous buffalo and eland. The last report
to OIE was 21 Feb 97 concerning 12 cases and 10 deaths in cattle (none
destroyed or slaugtered), At that time, the disease manifested itself as a
mild form not recognizable as rinderpest by cattle owners. However, the
virus was characterized by agar-gel immunodiffusion at the the Naational
Veterinary Research Centre Muguga and the OIE Reference Laboratory for
rinderpest in Pirbright, UK.
It is not to be assumed that the outbreaks are related. However, the spread
of infection from the Tanzanian event may occur, due to drought conditions
in Eastern Africa which are causing cattle to congregate at the remaining
water sources, as well as the Maasai practice of driving their cattle long
distances in search of pasture.
The Ngorongoro Crater outbreak is being considered an emergency, vaccination
is being mobilized, and the FAO has proposed another eradication project
(SPEAR) which would contain the current outbreak and hopefully eradicate the
disease in Africa.
Although the losses thus far in cattle are low, spontaneous reversions of
the virus to a virulent form have been known in the past, and if this should
occur losses could rise significantly. In the early 1980s reversion did
occur, loosening a panic among the Maasai herdsmen who sold animals and
moved others as far away from the outbreak site as possible. If this should
happen in the current outbreak, rinderpest could move through the Mbeya Gap
into Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Boswana and South Africa.
