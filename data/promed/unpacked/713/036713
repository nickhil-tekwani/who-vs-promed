It appears that weather conditions in Bangladesh may be exacerbating the
incidence of disease. Having spent the last few days researching the local
news in various parts of the country, there seems to be a recurring theme
with officialdom pointing to the weather as a source of increase in the
risk factor for diseases of various infectious diseases.
There have also been references to standing water increasing the number of
arthropod vectors of disease. As yet, I have not been able to determine if
anything is being done to increase the surveillance for these diseases,
based on the local news accounts.
Here is the latest example:

Diarrhoea claims 10 lives in Chandpur, Kurigram
-----------------------------------------------------------
Six children and an old woman died of diarrhoea in different parts of
Chandpur district in the last 15 days.
[Chandpur is about 70 miles south of the capital, Dhaka, in a direct line -

T.H, 7-month, M., 2-year, B.H., 5-year, and three other babies died at
various places. The old woman was identified as R.B., 60. [Names suppressed
- Mod.JW
They all died in hospitals after being moved there in critical diarrhoea
condition.
About 1500 diarrhoea patients - mostly children and their mothers - had
been rushed to ICDDR, B clinic at Matlab and other hospitals in the
district in last about two weeks, it was learnt.
[ICCDR,B is the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research,
Bangladesh - Mod.JW
More than 50 medical teams were reportedly working across district to
provide medical facilities to the diarrhoea affected people, official
sources said.
Another report adds from Kurigram: Diarrhoea induced by persisting heatwave
has claimed three lives and attacked some 10 thousand people in the
district in last two weeks, official sources said.
The dead were identified as rickshawpuller A.A., 29, of Gunaigachhi union
and N.B., 90, of Garai village of Ulipur thana and A.H., 70, of Chhinai
union in Rajarhat thana.
The heatwave, now sweeping across the country, caused various diseases,
like fever, diarrhoea and other stomach disorders, civil surgeon office
sources here said.

Children are among the worst-affected groups. Besides, the hot and humid
weather is hampering classes in schools as well [as barring people from
coming out of their homes.

According to an official source, of the total deaths 10 were reported from
Patuakhali, six from Barguna, six from Jhalakathi and two from Barisal. Of
the victims, 14 died during the last one week. But unofficial sources said
