Suspected Case of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Reported in Tanzania
--------------------------------------------------------------
DAR ES SALAAM: Tanzanian health authorities on Tue 7 Nov 2000 launched a
probe into the country's first suspected case of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in
the western border region of Kagera. National Health Permanent Secretary
Mariam Mwaffisi confirmed that the government had dispatched a team of
experts to Kagera, on Tanzania's border with Uganda, after unconfirmed
reports that an Ebola fever patient had been admitted to Kanyigo Clinic. The
clinic, in the heavily populated Muleba Rural District, serves the same
region where HIV/AIDS was first reported in 1983. "We dispatched the
task-team the moment we received initial reports, but want to caution people
that last time we had a reported Ebola fever case it turned out to be
nothing more than a serious malaria infection," said Mwaffisi.
She declined to comment further until the task-team tabled its report.
Initial unconfirmed reports on a possible Ebola case first surfaced on
Sunday, with Kagera's Regional Medical Office confirming one suspected
Ebola case at Kanyigo Clinic on Monday. Tanzania began taking precautionary
measures to contain and treat Ebola fever immediately after the outbreak
was reported in neighboring Uganda's southwestern regions last month. The
outbreak appears to be spreading south, with 91 reported dead and 190
infected to date. A further 16 people are under surveillance for possible
Ebola infection at Mbarara University Hospital, after reportedly coming
into contact with a Ugandan army Private who died of Ebola fever at the
hospital on 27 Oct 2000.

[It should be stressed that the diagnosis is unconfirmed, and that a
previous case of suspected Ebola fever in Tanzania was not confirmed. The
Ebola fever outbreak appears to be still contained to the region of
northern Uganda around Gulu, apart from 2 so far minor escapes. - Mod.CP
