1918 killer flu 'came from birds'
---------------------------------
The Spanish flu virus that killed 50 million people in 1918-19 was probably a
strain that originated in birds, research has shown. US scientists have found
the 1918 virus shares genetic mutations with the bird flu virus now
circulating in Asia.
Writing in Nature -- see
<http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051003/full/437794a.html> -- they say their
work underlines the threat the current strain poses to humans worldwide. A
second paper in Science reveals another US team has successfully recreated the
1918 virus in mice. The virus is contained at the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC] under stringent safety conditions. It is hoped to
carry out experiments to further understand the biological properties that
made the virus so virulent.
The virus was recreated from data produced by painstaking research by a team
from the US Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Working on virus samples from
the remains of victims of the 1918 pandemic, the researchers were able to
piece together the entire genetic sequence of the virus. They found the virus
contained elements that were new to humans of the time, making it highly
virulent. Analysis of the final 3 pieces of the virus' genetic code has
revealed mutations that have striking similarities to those found in flu
viruses found only in birds, such as the H5N1 strain currently found in south
east Asia.
Many experts believe it is only a matter of time before H5N1, or a
similar virus, causes many deaths in humans -- possibly after
combining [reassorting genome segments] with a human flu strain.
Crucially, the mutations identified by the US researchers were found
in genes which control the virus' ability to replicate in host cells.
The researchers say these mutations may have helped the 1918 virus
replicate more efficiently.
At this stage, they say the H5N1 strain shares only some, and not all, of
these mutations. But these mutations may be enough to increase the virulence
of the virus, and give it the potential to cause serious human infection
without first combining [reassorting genome segments] with a known human flu
strain. The researchers believe the 2 other major flu pandemics of the 20th
century -- in 1957 and 1968 -- were caused by human flu viruses which acquired
2 or 3 key genes from bird flu virus strains. But they believe the 1918 strain
was probably entirely a bird flu virus that adapted to function in humans.
Julie Gerberding, director of the US Ce
nters for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), said: "By unmasking the 1918
virus we are revealing some of the secrets that will help us predict and
prepare for the next pandemic." Dr Jeffery Taubenberger, lead researcher of
the Nature study, said: "Determining whether pandemic influenza virus strains
can emerge via different pathways will affect the scope and focus of
surveillance and prevention efforts."
Warning
-------
Professor John Oxford, an expert in virology at Queen Mary College, London,
said the suggestion that the virus had the potential to jump between humans
without first combining [reassorting] with a human virus made it even more of
a threat. "This study gives us an extra warning that H5N1 needs to be taken
even more seriously than it has been up to now," he said. Dr Terrence Tumpey,
of the US CDC, defended the decision to recreate the 1918 flu virus. He
said: "We felt we had to recreate the virus and run these experiments to
understand the biological properties that made the 1918 virus so exceptionally
deadly. "We wanted to identify the specific genes responsible for its
virulence, with the hope of designing antivirals or other interventions that
would work against virulent pandemic or epidemic influenza viruses."

The Introduction reads as follows: "Influenza viruses are remarkably
adept at surviving in the human population over a long time-scale. The
human influenza A virus continues to thrive even among populations
with widespread access to vaccines, and continues to be a major cause
of morbidity and mortality. The virus mutates from year to year,
making the existing vaccines ineffective on a regular basis, and
requiring that new strains be chosen for a new vaccine. Less-frequent
major changes, known as antigenic shift, create new strains against
which the human population has little protective immunity, thereby
causing worldwide pandemics. The most recent pandemics include the
1918 'Spanish' flu, one of the most deadly outbreaks in recorded
history, which killed 30-50 million people worldwide, the 1957 'Asian'
flu, and the 1968 'Hong Kong' flu (3).
Motivated by the need for a better understanding of influenza evolution, we
have developed flexible protocols that make it possible to apply large-scale
sequencing techniques to the highly variable influenza genome. Here we report
the results of sequencing 209 complete genomes of the human influenza A virus,
encompassing a total of 2 821 103 nucleotides. In addition to increasing
markedly the number of publicly available, complete influenza virus genomes,
we have discovered several anomalies in these first 209 genomes that
demonstrate the dynamic nature of influenza transmission and evolution. This
new, large-scale sequencing effort promises to provide a more comprehensive
picture of the evolution of influenza viruses and of their pattern of
transmission through human and animal populations. All data from this project
are being deposited, without delay, in public archives." - Mod.CP]
