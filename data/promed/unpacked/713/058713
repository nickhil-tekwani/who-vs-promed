Children's hospitals in the Chicago area have been going through past cases to see if any patients with hepatitis also tested positive for adenovirus. On Monday [25 Apr 2022], the Illinois Department of Public Health reported 3 such cases similar to the clusters in Alabama and Europe. Lurie Children's Hospital found another case from March [2022] on Tuesday [26 Apr 2022].

"The child did have vomiting, diarrhea and some respiratory symptoms and had hepatitis, but was not very severe," said Lurie Children's Hospital hepatologist, Dr. Catherine Chapin. Chapin said that child did recover and now all hepatitis patients at Lurie will be screened for adenovirus, especially adenovirus 41, which may be the cause of hepatitis outbreaks. "In some of these reports, the children require transplantation, so that is concerning and certainly we need to be paying attention," Chapin said.

Rush University Medicine pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Marielle Fricchione also weighed in. "The one [adenovirus] that causes diarrhea and vomiting could just get on the hands and be spread between kids through hands or surfaces touched by hands," Fricchione said. "We don't have a vaccine for adenovirus 41, so we do have to control it by hand-washing and cleaning surfaces."

While the doctors ABC7 spoke with explained adenovirus is known to cause liver inflammation or damage in kids with other health issues, what is troubling about the recent cases is the kids were healthy. They and others who care for kids across the country and around to world are eager to find out what is making some of these kids so sick.

[This 4th case "was not very severe," but we do not know the height of the aminotransferases to assess whether it fits the working case definition. It is worthwhile to note that in viral hepatitis, the height of the aminotransferases does not necessarily correlate with severity of the process as the height of bilirubin and decreased hepatic synthetic function (serum albumin and prothrombin time) seem to. - Mod.LL]

Doctors at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital in Nashville are investigating a high number of cases across the globe of severe inflammation of the liver. The illness has been identified as an "acute hepatitis of unknown origin" affecting children, some with no underlying health conditions. At least some of the 169 cases worldwide have needed liver transplants and one has died.

Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital has also treated several cases of the illness over the past few months according to Dr. Saeed Mohammad, an expert in pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition. Normally, the hospital may see 5 or 6 cases of acute hepatitis in children over the course of a year, but Dr. Mohammad says since the fall of 2021 through February/March 2022 the hospital has seen an increase in the overall number of cases, leading to some concern.

"With hepatitis, we often see children come in with gastrointestinal symptoms, things like vomiting and diarrhea," Dr. Mohammad says. "By the time they're coming to us, the parents have usually noticed they look a little yellow, especially the whites of their eyes...some of them have had fever and some of them have not had fever." When children come into the hospital, doctors will test for viruses; 2 of the cases treated at Monroe Carell Jr. were found to have also been infected with adenovirus. While there is no specific correlation, the hospital is working with the Tennessee Department of Health and the CDC in an effort to track cases and determine the origin of the illnesses.

"For the patients that we have seen so far, thankfully all of them have recovered, none of them have needed a transplant," Dr. Mohammad says. He recommends parents continue pre-pandemic practices such as hand washing and keeping children from playing with other sick children. Although there is still more to learn about the illness, Dr. Mohammad says he doesn't believe at this time it is something spreading in the population and could have been just a cluster of cases. "I don't think anyone needs to fear that this is a disease that is going through the community right now and that we have to limit interaction because of it."

Dr. Mohammad says parents can also check to see if their kids are acting lethargic, which could be another indicator of the illness. Parents are advised to take their kids to their primary physician. Cases of the illness in the USA have been reported in Alabama and California, in addition to Tennessee.

[The total number of cases in Tennessee is not stated nor is the severity of illness. This post mentions cases in California, but as far as I can find, cases have at this point been noted in Alabama, North Carolina, Illinois and now Tennessee. These cases are mostly noted using the retrospectoscope, and more cases that fit the current case definition may well be reported. - Mod.LL]

Nearly 200 cases of a mysterious outbreak of severe hepatitis in children have now been reported worldwide as it has now been detected in Japan and Canada. Scientists are urgently looking into what is causing the global outbreak, with public health officials in the UK saying lockdown could be a factor.

Around 190 unexplained cases have now been detected in 12 countries worldwide, now including Japan and Canada.

The case in Japan of the liver inflammation disease was flagged by local authorities on 21 Apr 2022 in a child who had tested negative for adenovirus -- a possible cause being investigated worldwide -- and COVID. The patient had not needed a liver transplant, the health ministry said on Monday [25 Apr 2022].

Meanwhile, Canada's Public Health Agency said on Tuesday [26 Apr 2022] it was investigating reports of severe acute hepatitis of unknown origin in young children. It did not reveal the number of cases or their location.

So far, the UK has reported 114 cases of severe, acute hepatitis "of unknown origin" in children under the age of 10. A further 11 other countries have also reported cases, including Ireland, the USA, Israel, the Netherlands and Romania -- and now Japan and Canada. One child has died worldwide and around 10% of those affected have required a liver transplant.

The WHO addressed the global outbreak in a media briefing on Tuesday [26 Apr 2022]. Professor Philippa Easterbrook, a senior scientist at the WHO, said: "The causes of the cases remain under active investigation, looking at [several] possible underlying factors." The cases do not feature the viruses typically responsible for acute liver inflammation -- hepatitis A, B, C, D and E -- the professor said.

Professor Easterbrook said there was a possible link to adenovirus, a common infection found in children. Adenovirus has been detected in around 74 of the hepatitis cases that have been tested, she told reporters. She added: "It is unusual for an adenovirus to cause this type of severe symptoms and so this is what is being actively investigated at the moment."

[More cases of severe hepatocellular injury in children are being reported with many reported on review of previous cases. Cases apparently fitting the clinical case definition have come from at least 12 European countries, the USA (now 4 states), Canada and Japan to this point and are likely to increase.

Adenovirus serotype 41, one of the so-called enteric adenoviruses, has been found in some of the cases, but the virus has not been known previously to cause hepatitis in the immunologically normal host. Whether the finding of adenovirus serotype 41 is an epiphenomenon or the virus is etiologic here is not yet known. No information has yet been forthcoming on evidence that the virus was found in liver tissue or not, and indeed the specific pathology of the affected liver has not been reported. If the virus is the cause here, has the agent acquired additional virulence factors or is a cofactor involved (virus or toxin)? Are certain children genetically more susceptible for the more severe disease?

To this point, no evidence for household clusters has been reported, which one might expect if a foodborne toxin or transmissible agent was involved. Additionally, it would be interesting to know if any asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were looked for in household contacts. The cases recognized as severe could be the "tip of the iceberg," as we saw with paralytic poliomyelitis when only a small percentage of infections resulted in the classical asymmetrical flaccid paralysis of polio. - Mod.LL
