A woman has died and botulism poisoning is suspected in 5 other people in Viet Nam. The Viet Nam Food Administration reported it had been informed of 3 patients in the city of Thuan An, in Binh Duong Province. The woman, in her 40s, died in a hospital but her 53-year-old sister and 16-year-old daughter have been given botulinum antitoxin and health officials said their condition is improving.

All 3 illnesses are related to a lunch on [Sat 20 Mar 2021] at a shrine near their home. They had the same symptoms and had previously eaten pate, according to the husband and the son of the 53-year-old patient. Another 3 patients with similar symptoms and a history of eating noodle soup at a shrine in Binh Dương were admitted to hospital on [Thu 25 Mar 2021]. There are also reports of botulism in Kon Tum province that could be linked to salted fish.

Botulism poisoning is a rare illness caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria. The Viet Nam Food Administration advised people not to use canned products that have expired or if the tin is inflated, damaged or rusty or if products have an unusual taste and color. In 2020, an outbreak of botulism involving 13 people in the country was associated with a brand of vegetarian pate.

[Most outbreaks of foodborne botulism are related to home prepared food but, like the pate outbreak in Viet Nam in 2020, commercially prepared foods can also be involved. The exact source of the food or foods noted here are not stated.

Botulism occurs when usually preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract; when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

A recently published paper by Miyashita S-I, et al. presents a new immunologic technique for delivering a biologic to actually reverse the effects of the toxin.

"Abstract:
--------
Efficient penetration of cell membranes and specific targeting of a cell type represent major challenges for developing therapeutics toward intracellular targets. One example facing these hurdles is to develop post-exposure treatment for botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), a group of bacterial toxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G) that are major potential bioterrorism agents. BoNTs enter motor neurons, block neurotransmitter release, and cause a paralytic disease botulism. Members of BoNTs such as BoNT/A exhibit extremely long half-life within neurons, resulting in persistent paralysis for months, yet there are no therapeutics that can inhibit BoNTs once they enter neurons. Here, we developed a chimeric toxin-based delivery platform by fusing the receptor-binding domain of a BoNT, which targets neurons, with the membrane translocation domain and inactivated protease domain of the recently discovered BoNT-like toxin BoNT/X, which can deliver cargoes across endosomal membranes into the cytosol. A therapeutic protein was then created by fusing a single-domain antibody (nanobody) against BoNT/A with the delivery platform. In vitro characterization demonstrated that nanobodies were delivered into cultured neurons and neutralized BoNT/A in neurons. Administration of this protein in mice shortened duration of local muscle paralysis, restoring muscle function within hours, and rescued mice from systemic toxicity of lethal doses of BoNT/A. Fusion of 2 nanobodies, one against BoNT/A and the other against BoNT/B, created a multivalent therapeutic protein able to neutralize both BoNT/A and BoNT/B in mice. These studies provide an effective post-exposure treatment for botulism and establish a platform for intracellular delivery of therapeutics targeting cytosolic proteins and processes."
