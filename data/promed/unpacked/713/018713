-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[My comment regarding yellow fever (YF) vaccination in central
Paraguay was inaccurately expressed. I had intended to communicate
that the risk of of serious YF virus infection in unvaccinated people
outweighs the risk of adverse reaction to the vaccine in healthy,
immunocompetent individuals. The main point is that people who go
into areas where active yellow fever virus transmission is going on
should be vaccinated before entering these areas. From a public
health perspective, this is especially true for tourists who run the
risk of becoming infected in areas of sylvan yellow fever and then
return to urban areas while viremic, where _Aedes aegypti_ are
abundant. As Mod.JW commented recently in ProMED archive no.
20080205.0461, "...how long can Brazil continue to dodge the [urban
YF virus transmission] bullet?" Or can Paraguay?

I regret any confusion that my original comment may have caused. -Mod.TY]
