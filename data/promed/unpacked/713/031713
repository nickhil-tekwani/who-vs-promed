Island epidemic on the decline -- French parliamentarian
--------------------------------------------------------
The disabling mosquitoborne disease, chikungunya, which has affected more
than a quarter of people living on the French Indian Ocean island of
Reunion is now in sharp decline, the French Senate was told. "The
high-point of the epidemic is behind us," Nicolas About, president of the
Senate's social affairs committee said.
New cases are down to 4400 a week compared with 47 000 at the start of
February 2006, About said in a report on his recent visit to the island.
Overall, some 218 000 people -- out of a total population of 777 000 --
have contracted chikungunya in the last year, of whom 155 have died
directly or indirectly as a result of the disease.
The disease gets its name from a Swahili word meaning "that which bends up"
because of its arthritic-type symptoms that leave victims stooped. Most
patients eventually recover. The French government has committed emergency
health and economic aid worth over 90 million Euros [USD 110 million] to
help Reunion fight the scourge but was criticized for failing to react
quickly enough.

Chikungunya hits 21 mandals in Kadapa
-------------------------------------
Chikungunya has affected about 8000 people in 75 villages in 21 mandals,
but no deaths have been reported.
According to the district medical and health department officials, the
disease is spreading to other parts of the region, and therefore they have
taken up awareness campaigns to arrest its spread to new areas. District
medical and health officer K Pitchi Reddy said on Tuesday [28 Mar 2006]
that chikungunya was not caused from eating chicken but spreads through the
tiger mosquito, which breeds in fresh water and bites during daytime. He
advised people not to store drinking water for long periods and to keep the
containers clean. He said chikungunya causes high fever coupled with severe
body pains and could be treated with paracetamol (acetaminophen). The tiger
mosquito usually does not survive beyond 30 Celsius, and with the soaring
temperatures of summer, the incidence of the disease will come down, he
explained.
The blood samples collected from the patients were sent for analysis to
Pune, and fogging has begun in the affected areas. An action plan was
developed with the Malaria Department and NGOs for preventive measures.
Meanwhile, Kadapa Mayor P Ravindranatha Reddy said that all preventive
measures had been taken to prevent the spread of the disease in the town.
He said that chikungunya was prevalent in Yerramukkapalli, Nagarajupet,
Chemmumiapet, Akkayapalli, and Ashoknagar in the town and that medical
teams had been deployed there and that free medicines were being
distributed. 8000 people have come down with the disease in 75 villages.
