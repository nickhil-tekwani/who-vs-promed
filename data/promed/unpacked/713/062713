A whooping cough outbreak on PEI [Prince Edward Island Province], the 1st in nearly a decade, is growing in the western part of the province. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a bacterial lung infection that poses a serious risk to babies. Adults can show much milder symptoms, which can help in its spread.

"With those individuals they can actually have pertussis, have a mild cough and not know it, and then pass it on to vulnerable infants," said Dr David Sabapathy, the province's deputy chief health officer. The outbreak started with 6 confirmed cases in February 2014. There are now 24. A total of 4 babies have been hospitalized.

Most of the cases in this outbreak happened in Western PEI. Several of those afflicted were not immunized, he said, but should have been. "It often will happen in pockets of people, in communities that are under-immunized with pertussis vaccine, so we encourage you to get your vaccine," said Sabapathy.

Of the 22 confirmed cases of pertussis (whooping cough) on the North Coast [of British Columbia Province], 20 of them are on the islands [Haida Gwaii], according to a Northern Health press release this week. That number is likely higher, however, as not every case gets swabbed and tested, said Jane Boutette, Northern Health's public health nursing manager for Prince Rupert and Haida Gwaii.

"It's really scary," said an expectant mother who is in her 3rd trimester of pregnancy and found out from her midwife that she had been exposed to pertussis. She was immediately prescribed antibiotics and said she is now just hoping the baby, which is due next week, will not be born until the 5-day cycle of antibiotics is over. "It can be fatal for a newborn," she said, and described herself upset and angry with the situation. "I wish people were more aware of how this affects other people," she said. "It's your choice whether you immunize or not, but it's not all about you and your own little world."

Ms Boutette said the people Northern Health worries about most are women in their 3rd trimester of pregnancy and infants under one year old. "We're asking anyone who has signs or symptoms to go to a clinic, get swabbed and notify Northern Health if they've been in contact with infants or a pregnant woman. We'll then contact them and we can offer prophylactic antibiotics. If you have a cough, try your best to isolate yourself," she said.
