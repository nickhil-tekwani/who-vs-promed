I've been forwarded an article from ProMED which is titled "BANILLA
VIRUS, BATS & HUMANS - AUSTRALIA (02)".
You observe in a footnote to the article, the virus has been referred to as
Ballina virus, "(for the place where the first human infection
was contracted)".
There are two problems here:
(1) Somewhere along the line the virus appears to have mutated from
Ballina virus to Banilla virus. Presumably it is only one more
mutation away from becoming vanilla virus, the new food
technologist's dream!
(2) Also Ballina is not the place where the first human infection was
contracted -- it's the place where the bat was collected which
yielded the first [isolate] of the virus. Veterinary authorities
were looking for equine morbillivirus in bats, and I'm pretty sure
the bat was submitted because it was displaying unusual symptoms --
although EMV has never to my knowledge been associated with disease
in bats.

[Allen is quite right, the title should have read "Ballina" -- the
Subject line was correct (the archives will be fixed).
I use the name "Ballina" because that is the only reasonable name I
have seen. I didn't name it. Many in Australia do not use or even
know this name and it will be instructive to see the final, accepted
name for this rabies-like lyssavirus - Mod.CHC]
