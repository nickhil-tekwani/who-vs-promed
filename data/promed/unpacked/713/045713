COCCIDIOMYCOSIS, ZEBRAS
========================
I have recently come across two cases of zebras that were determined
to be seropositive for coccidiomycosis in the southwestern US.
My questions are:
1. Does seropositivity (I assume AGID) indicate anything other than
exposure?
2. Have any seroprevalence studies been done in the southwest with
respect to horses/equids and coccidiomycoses?
Thanks in advance for any information.
Dave
