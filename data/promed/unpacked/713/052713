CHOLERA -- VIRUS IMPLICATED
===========================

In a report appearing in today's issue of Science magazine, two researchers
say that deadly strains of cholera are produced by a bacteriophage that
insinuates itself into the cell of a cholera bacterium and inserts a
toxin-producing gene into the bacterial chromosome.
>From that point, the gene "creates a strain of cholera that can cause
disease," says Matthew K. Waldor of Tuffs University.
According to Waldor and John J. Mekalanos of
Harvard Medical School, where the two researchers did the work, the viral
takeover is enabled by "threadlike structures called pili" on the surface
of the cholera bacterium. The virus enters the cell through these
threads.
Waldor also said that "only the strains of cholera that have both pili and
the toxin gene provided by the virus are dangerous." The research may lead
to the creation of a vaccine that would either prevent the virus from
entering the bacterial cell or short-circuit the toxin gene so that no
poison would be produced to cause the severe diarrhea that can lead to death.
In a statement to Science, Stephen Richardson of Wake Forest University in
North Carolina said "It's one of the most important findings in cholera
research in the last 10 years."
