A turkey farm in Brown County of south-central Minnesota has become the latest in the state to fall victim to bird flu.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health on Monday said the presumptive positive case announced on Monday is the 4th farm in Brown County to be affected by the outbreaks. Brown County recorded its 1st case last week. The disease has cost Minnesota's turkey and chicken producers nearly 8.4 million birds, not counting the new case and a couple others for which flock sizes are still being tallied.

The board says 103 farms across Minnesota have been hit by bird flu. Birds that didn't die of the disease itself have been euthanized on 94 farms. 48 farms have disposed of their carcasses and been cleared to start cleaning and disinfecting.

The top turkey-producing county in the top turkey state has reported another case of bird flu.

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health reported presumptive positive test results on Tuesday [2 Jun 2015] from a 39th flock in Kandiyohi (kan-dee-YOH'-high) County. The west-central county is the center of Minnesota's turkey industry and it's been hit harder than any other county in the state by the H5N2 avian influenza virus.

The new case raises the number of affected farms in Minnesota to 104. The outbreaks have cost Minnesota turkey and chicken producers more than 8.4 million birds.

Avian influenza has invaded 4 more turkey farms in the Upper Midwest: 2 in Iowa, one in Minnesota, and 1 in South Dakota, according to state and media reports. The Iowa and Minnesota incidents were announced today, and the South Dakota was revealed late last week.

2 Iowa counties affected
-----
In Iowa, the virus hit turkey farms in Hamilton and Calhoun counties, marking the 2nd outbreak in each, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land stewardship (IDALS) said today. Hamilton is in central Iowa, and Calhoun lies 2 counties to the west.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the "highly pathogenic H5 virus" on the Hamilton County farm, which has 36 000 turkeys, the IDALS said, without mentioning H5N2 specifically. At the Calhoun County farm, with 21 000 birds, initial testing showed the H5 virus, and confirmatory test results from the USDA are awaited.

Iowa has now had 65 outbreaks in 18 counties, with 28.6 million poultry affected, according to IDALS data.

Minnesota outbreaks reach 103
------
In Minnesota, the affected farm is in the south-central county of Brown, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) reported today. The outbreak is listed as a presumptive positive, and the size of the flock is not yet available. Minnesota now has 103 farms hit by avian flu in 23 counties, the DPS said. More than 8.3 million birds have been affected, not counting farms for which flock size estimates are not yet available.

South Dakota reports 10th event
------
The South Dakota outbreak was reported on 29 May 2015 in Moody County, which borders Minnesota. South Dakota state veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven, DVM, said a farm with about 50 000 birds had a presumptive positive test for avian flu, according to a 29 May 2015 Associated Press (AP) story. He said officials were waiting for confirmation of the H5N2 virus and that crews would soon start euthanizing the surviving turkeys to stop the virus's spread.

The outbreak is South Dakota's 10th recent avian flu incident and the 2nd in Moody County, according to a chart maintained by the South Dakota Animal Industry Board (AIB). The previous outbreak, reported on 14 May 2015, involved an egg farm with 1.3 million chickens.

The South Dakota outbreaks have affected a total of 1.7 million birds, according to the AIB. In other developments, the North Dakota Department of Agriculture (NDDA) today announced the end of a ban on poultry movements in control zones around the 2 farms in Dickey and LaMoure counties that were hit by H5N2 in April 2015.

[There seems to be a slight discrepancy on whether 103 or 104 premises are infected in Minnesota. But without regard to the specific number, these types of numbers demonstrate the rapid spread of this disease. - Mod.TG
