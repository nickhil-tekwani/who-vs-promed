AVIAN INFLUENZA - EASTERN ASIA (115): MAP

We recently saw a request, from one of your moderators, for a map of
avian influenza outbreaks in Thailand. The Microbial Risk Assessment
team at the Health Protection Agency, Porton Down, in the UK, is
currently working with ProMED-mail to map all ProMED reports. We are
close to completing a mapping function, however, in the meantime, we
thought we would respond to your request by providing a map of
poultry outbreaks of Avian influenza in Thailand.
The map, with details of our collaboration, can be found at the
following address, and we would be happy for you to make this
available to all ProMED-mail readers:
