Shanghai reports 1st child death of hand-foot-mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Shanghai Health Bureau on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008] confirmed the
city's 1st pediatric death of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). A
2-year-old boy was sent to the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center
for treatment on the evening of 14 May 2008, where he was diagnosed
as having HFMD. Emergency treatment failed and he died a few hours
later, according to the bureau.

The child, a native of north China's Henan Province, lived with his
family in the Songjiang District of Shanghai, said a bureau
statement. Medical experts were still studying the case.

Shanghai reported 10 340 HFMD cases in the first 5 months [of 2008].
The city is not on the Health Ministry's list of the regions worst
hit by the epidemic. The ministry reported earlier last week that
there were more than 176 000 HFMD cases reported nationwide last
month [May 2008]. Daily reported cases declined from 11 501 at the
peak on 14 May 2008 to 3922 on 5 Jun 2008. Central Anhui Province,
which 1st reported the outbreak of HFMD, had 10 700 cases in May 2008
including 4 deaths. The worst-hit provinces were Guangdong, Zhejiang,
Hebei, Shandong and Hunan, according to the ministry's report.
Nurseries in Fuyang City, Anhui, the worst-hit city, resumed classes
on Children's Day (1 Jun 2008) as health authorities considered the
situation to be under control.

HFMD can be caused by a host of intestinal viruses, but EV71 and the
Coxsackie virus [coxsackievirus A16] are the most common. Those with
EV71 often show serious symptoms. It can also lead to meningitis,
encephalitis, pulmonary edema and paralysis in some children. There
is no vaccine

[The late reporting of the death of a child which occurred on 14 May
2008 (if not an error) is presumably a consequence of the decision of
the Chinese Ministry of Health henceforth to report HFMD case numbers
and deaths at monthly intervals. The statistics in the above report
suggest that the countrywide outbreak of HMDV has passed its peak and
that overall mortality has been low. Fuyang city in Anhui province
remains the exception, where the high mortality has yet to be
explained. It may be that the outbreak of HFMDV sweeping through Asia
this year is in fact a series of discrete epidemics caused by several
different enteroviruses, separately or in conjunction with enterovirus 71.
