Another 2 persons have died of flu-like disease at Rodikot VDC [village development committee], taking the toll in Humla district to 18 in the past 3 weeks.

A local from Rodikot said that 2 persons, both 60 years old, of Rahadeu, died on [Fri 29 Apr 2016] due to the seasonal flu. Some other villagers have been taken ill. 16 people died due to similar symptoms at Raya, Syada, and Madana VDCs in the district. The elderly people and children have been greatly affected with the disease. People suffering from the disease have symptoms including headache, fever, and common cold.

Contrary to the District Public Health Office's claim of sending medical teams to the affected area, the villagers complain of a shortage of medicines. "The disease is spreading, but there are not medicines in the village," said a resident of Rodikot, adding that elderly people suffering from asthma are hit hardest by the disease.

According to Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, an officer at the District Administration Office, there is a shortage of medicine at Saya, Barai, Gothi, and Shreenagar, among other villages in the district.

[The report does not mention whether there was laboratory testing for influenza, however it indicates that most cases presented with a flu like illness leading to 16 deaths in various districts.

It is important to determine if there is adequate availability of primary health services and medicines in these areas, to assess the prevalence of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), including estimation of morbidity/mortality data, and to continue surveillance activity so that health services can be reciprocally planned. -Mod.UBA
