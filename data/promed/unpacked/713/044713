Fever affects 3000 people in Rourkela
-------------------------------------
Despite efforts to control it, an airborne mystery fever has affected
around 3000 people in Rourkela, and the disease is slowly taking
epidemic form.
The viral fever was spreading unexpectedly, and the number of people
affected had risen to 3000 as of [1 Mar 2006], Chief District Medical
Officer, Dr. Premananda Patnaik said today [2 Mar 2006].
The fever has also been reported from Kishantola, Chhend Colony,
Rukutola, Railway Colony, PHD Colony and Banglatoli, most of them
located in slums here.
4 doctors from Bhubaneswar and an equal number from VSS medical
college at Burla were assigned the task to take care of the situation.
Another team of 20 local doctors was assigned for service, while a
joint director of the state health department was monitoring the
situation. About 5 mobile camps were organized to check the spread of
the disease.
On [1 Mar 2006], about 800 new cases had been reported from different
camps. 69 indoor patients have been discharged after their condition
improved.
Patnaik also said that the patients were complaining of headache,
severe body pain and vomiting.
As many as 857 blood samples were tested, and 9 cases of malaria had
been detected since the fever surfaced on [28 Feb 2006].
While mainly adults were affected by the fever, doctors ruled out
detection of bird flu virus.

[ProMED-mail originally posted on this outbreak based on a 1 Mar 2006
newswire that mentioned approximately 900 cases (see reference
below). The latest newswire reports above mention approximately 3000
cases. There is mention that out of 857 blood samples tested, 9 were
confirmed to be due to malaria, suggesting that the remaining 848
blood samples were negative for malaria, and that therefore the above
outbreak is not due to an increase in malaria in the region. Once
again, we are requesting information from knowledgeable sources as to
the findings of investigations into the etiology of the above
mentioned outbreak. There must be some subscriber out there who has
information on this outbreak other than that contained in newswires.
