Bluetongue Control Zones merged as case found in Peterborough
-------------------------------------------------------------
DEFRA has merged the Bluetongue Control Zone in Peterborough with the
Control Zone covering East Anglia, Kent, and East Sussex to create a single
zone in the east of England. [The DEFRA map, showing the new situation, is
included at the above URL. - Mod.AS] This follows the discovery of a new
case of bluetongue in Cambridgeshire. The Protection Zone remains unchanged.

The Department has also published the first epidemiology report into the
bluetongue outbreak, based on the situation up to 19 Oct 2007. The report
concludes that the infection is likely to have been introduced into
Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex on the night of 4/5 Aug 2007 by windborne
transmission of infected midges from continental Europe. It concludes that
the virus is causing relatively little damage on the farms it infects. The
report describes the "generally low morbidity, mortality and prevalence
rates in infected animals. The majority of infected premises have only one
infected animal and the prevalence is generally low," it says. The report
says that surveillance and testing are ongoing to gain an understanding of
the geographical extent of infection and to determine disease prevalence
within herds and flocks.

[The epidemiological report is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/epidemiology-report301007.pdf>.
It includes, among others, the following description of clinical findings,
morbidity, and mortality in sheep at the 1st visit:

"19. The most commonly recorded clinical signs observed in sheep have been:
lethargy and depression, recumbency, respiratory difficulty, pyrexia
(40-40.5 C [104-105 F]), oedema of face (especially lips), mucopurulent
nasal discharge, increased salivation and hyperaemia of the nasal mucosa,
and oedema of coronary band. [These are the classical BT disease symptoms
in sheep, though temperatures may reach higher values, up to 41-42 C. - Mod.AS]

"20. With the exception of 3 of the 8 premises from which clinical
bluetongue disease was reported in sheep, only one animal was affected at
the time of the 1st visit. There were 2 sheep affected in a flock of 58. In
another flock 2 sheep were affected in a group of 40 and in the other flock
one sheep had died overnight and another sheep was in extremis, and
therefore euthanased, having shown the same clinical signs. No other deaths
attributable to bluetongue were observed in the other flocks. BTV was not
confirmed in any goat herds or other ruminant species as a result of
reporting suspect clinical cases of bluetongue. (One of 2 goats was
serologically positive at the follow-up visit to a mixed farm in which one
cow was clinically affected.)

"21. The above findings relate to the early course of infection and disease
in these herds and flocks. Follow-up studies are therefore being planned in
order to monitor the clinical incidence and the mortality rates in a
sample, at least, of infected flocks and herds."

It is to be hoped that future UK reports will include information on the
breeds of the affected sheep, to allow a valid assessment of the virus
pathogenicity. - Mod.AS]

[2] Switzerland: no culling

New cases expected
------------------
The Basel cantonal veterinarian Markus Spichtig said that 2 to 3 additional
cattle have shown disease symptoms in the affected farm in Bettingen
(Basel). A total of 6 cattle initially tested positive for the (harmless to
humans) disease. The disease is infectious for all ruminants, and
particularly pathogenic for sheep. The Federal Veterinary Office (FVO)
decided that only animals with severe symptoms should be culled.It was
assumed that there are numerous infected midges; new cases were therefore
expected during the "next few days and weeks".

To curb the further spread, a 20 km [12.4 mile] protection zone has been
declared since yesterday [29 Oct 2007] around Bettingen. It includes almost
100 municipalities within the cantons Basel-Stadt, Baselland, Solothurn and
Aargau. Live ruminants are not allowed leaving the Zone, unless directly to
slaughterhouses. The rest of Switzerland is considered to be in a
Surveillance Zone.

[Clinical and serological surveillance for bluetongue have been operational
in Switzerland since 2006; the Swiss Federation's handling of the outbreak
is exemplary, demonstrating understanding of bluetongue's epidemiology.
This has been demonstrated by the immediate notification (without waiting
for "proof of virus circulation") and refraining from unjustified culling.
Hopefully, vaccination will follow the soonest. - Mod.AS]
