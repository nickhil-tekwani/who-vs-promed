[It is now 13 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report, there are 11 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 5 in Guangdong, 3 in Heilongjiang, 2 in Shandong, and 1 in Liaoning. It has now been 23 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 12 days or so... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? Are these cases related to importations? There were a total of 46 newly confirmed cases of which 36 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 82 367 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3342 deaths, representing an increase of 26 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (15 Apr 2020) report, and no newly reported deaths. An additional 3 suspected cases were newly reported, all local cases, 2 in Heilongjiang, 1 in inner Mongolia. 1 new case was reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to be reported daily but decreasing in numbers. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 15 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1549. There are an additional 57 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 66 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 3 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1038. 206 of these are importations from abroad. I believe they mention there were 10 asymptomatic cases who developed symptoms in the past 24 hours, 6 of whom were imported cases. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates, and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020 China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see if this is safe timing. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

Current clusters:
- From Love Tree Clinic in Daegu City, 1 case (a discharged patient of the clinic) was confirmed on [12 Apr 2020]. Upon investigation into contacts, 2 additional cases (who worked in the clinic) were confirmed. Further epidemiological investigation is underway.

- From Euijeongbu St. Mary's Hospital in Gyeonggi Province, 5 additional cases (patients = 2; staff/worker = 1; family/guardians/other contacts = 2) were confirmed while under quarantine. In total, 69 cases (patients = 26; staff/workers = 17; family/guardians/other contacts = 26) have been confirmed since [29 Mar 2020].

- From Yecheon-gun, Gyeongbuk Province, 6 additional cases were confirmed during investigation of contacts. In total, 31 cases (including 2 in Andong City and 1 in Mungyeong City) have been confirmed since [9 Apr 2020].

Other information:
- KCDC published the results of its evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity through blood and excrement (urine, stool) culture tests from COVID-19 patients.
From culture testing of the 24 samples from which SARS-CoV-2 gene was detected (out of a total of 699 serum, urine, and stool samples obtained from 74 patients), no isolated virus was found. This means that it is highly unlikely that COVID-19 can be transmitted through a path other than the respiratory system.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 22 cases and 1 death compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (15-16 Apr 2020) when there were 22 newly confirmed cases. A total of 10 635 confirmed cases, including 2 deaths were reported today, up from 10 613 cases and 229 deaths yesterday (15 Apr 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 17 consecutive days and below 50 for 10 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 64.2% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.8% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Gyeongbuk reported 4 (18.2%%) newly confirmed cases, all 12 locally acquired; Seoul reported 2 newly confirmed cases, 1 imported, 1 locally acquired; Daegu reported no newly confirmed cases. Quarantined imported cases represented 50% of the newly confirmed cases, with 11 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. Of interest is that 14 (63.6%) of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases and 8 (36.4%) were locally acquired. 11 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

From the English language update for 16 Apr 2020, imported cases have constituted 53.6% of newly confirmed cases directly plus another 9.4% of cases linked to imported cases during the last 2 weeks with a total number of imported cases now at 967.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 168 941 cases, including 22 170 deaths, up from 165 155 cases and 21 645 deaths reported on 15 Apr 2020. The 24-hour change between 15 and 16 Apr 2020 was 3786 newly confirmed cases, compared with 2667 newly confirmed cases between 14 Apr 2020 and 15 Apr 2020 -- an apparent increase that may be related to decreased reporting over Easter [10-13 Apr 2020]. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country -- in Lombardy (63 094), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (21 486), Veneto (14 990), and Piedmont (19 108). These 4 provinces combined account for 69.8% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Piedmont, with 23.2% of the newly confirmed cases reported is seeing more than Emilia-Romagna (12.1%), and Veneto (9.7%). Lombardy is still the main contributor representing 24.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 38 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 36 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details)

The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 677 570, including 34 617 deaths, an increase from 644 089 cases, and 28 529 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 226 198 (33.4%) cumulative case reports and 11 550 (34.5%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) website reported 117 565 cases and 7563 confirmed deaths and 3914 probable deaths as of 2:30 pm on 16 Apr 2020 (note: earlier updates were at 5 pm on the day of the update and more recently at 1 PM EDT). Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (4287 newly confirmed cases 12.8%), Massachusetts (2263 newly confirmed cases 4.8%), and Michigan (1204 newly confirmed cases 4.3%), Illinois (1140 newly confirmed cases 3.4%), Connecticut (1129 newly confirmed cases 3.4%), and Georgia (1108 newly confirmed cases 3.3%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number 1, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Florida, and Louisiana.

[Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. Unfortunately, the apparent major decline in daily reported cases is not holding up with 5183 newly confirmed cases reported today (16 Apr 2020) and 4978 cases reported yesterday (15 Apr 2020), returning to the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day -- perhaps the increased decline was a function of the Easter holidays.

As of today [16 Apr 2020], totals of 182 816 cases and 19 130 deaths have been reported, up from 177 633 cases and 18 579 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (15 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 154.34, slowly decreasing over the past 7 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 154.43 today [14 Apr 2020]. Spain has the highest case count in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 182 816 cases, approximately 76 752 (42.0%) have been hospitalized and 7916 (4.36%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data Table 3 at the source URL shows the weekly evolution of daily increases in newly confirmed cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths from mid-March (2020) to this current week (week of 13 Apr 2020). Case confirmations have gone from daily increases of 20% to 2.6%, hospitalizations from 34% to 1.7%, ICU admissions from 40% to 1.5% and deaths from 38% to 3%. Clearly demonstrating decreasing cases, and impact on health services.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7235125,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
