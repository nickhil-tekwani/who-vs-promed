Cambodia confirms new bird flu outbreak
---------------------------------------
Cambodian official on Sunday confirmed a new bird flu outbreak in Kandal
province, about 12 km south from the capital Phnom Penh, raising the fears
of the spread of the deadly virus in Cambodia.
It is the 1st report of bird flu outbreak in Cambodia [in 2005; see item 2
and commentary]. The H5N1 virus was detected by Phnom Penh's Pasteur
Institute in dead chickens in a small family chicken farm, Agriculture
Ministry official San Vanty told reporters on Sunday. More than 100
chickens there were already culled and the official from the government and
the World Health Organization (WHO) hurriedly went there to take measures,
he added.
Officials ordered the people not to eat dead chickens and ducks, and it was
prohibited to ship poultry out of this area. Meanwhile, disinfectant was
sprayed in the area to prevent the spread of the virus.
Cambodia's Ministry of Health and the WHO confirmed on Saturday that a
25-year-old woman from Kampot Province who died of respiratory illness in
Vietnam on 30 Jan 2005 was infected with avian influenza, which is the 1st
human case of avian influenza in Cambodia.

Cambodia confirms bird flu in poultry near capital
---------------------------------------------------
Bird flu has been found in chickens near the Cambodian capital, officials
said on Sunday, raising fears about the spread of the deadly virus in a
country with little to no health system.
The H5N1 virus strain was detected in dead chickens at a small poultry farm
in the province of Kandal, just south of Phnom Penh.
"People are now aware of the virus and when they suspected a case they
reported it to us. The bird flu has hit our country again," said
Agriculture Ministry official San Vanty.
Bird flu 1st hit Cambodia in September in 2004, but the virus which has
killed humans in neighbouring Vietnam and Thailand, did not claim its 1st
Cambodian victim until January 2005, when a 25-year-old woman succumbed in
Vietnam.
Officials in the war-scarred southeast Asian nation, which is still
recovering from the Khmer Rouge genocide of the 1970s, conceded they are
unable to do much in the face of a highly contagious and invisible enemy.
"Even though we have no new suspected cases, it is still a worry for us
because we have a poor health system," San Vanty said.
However, health ministry officials said tests had shown that the province
of Kampot, where the female Cambodian victim, lived close to the Vietnam
border, did not have any H5N1 cases.
"She could had been affected by the virus from another place," said Sok
Touch, head of communicable diseases at the Ministry of Health.
Most bird flu victims have caught the virus from infected poultry, but
experts fear it could mutate into a form that is easily passed between
humans, unleashing a global flu pandemic that could kill millions.

[Cambodia's last follow-up report to the OIE was sent on 22 Sept 2004,
describing an H5N1 outbreak in a commercial poultry farm, also in the
Kandal province (see <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_26.htm#Sec7>).
Looking at the regional map (available in the above Reuters Alertnet
web-site), it seems almost impossible that Cambodia (and, for that matter,
also Laos), situated between 2 heavily infected countries, Thailand and
Vietnam, could remain unaffected by a disease spread by avian fauna.
In view of yesterday's official confirmation of the 1st human case of avian
influenza in Cambodia, one cannot escape reflecting upon the Thai
chronology. On 23 Feb 2004 Thailand officially reported the 1st case of
HPAI in poultry, a day after the reporting of the 1st suspected human case.
Intensified surveillance activities and public awareness, accompanied by
the prescribed preventive control measures, are urgently required. - Mod.AS]
