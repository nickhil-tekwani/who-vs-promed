Influenza and acute respiratory viral infections morbidity - Russia: (Moscow)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tatyana Golikova, the Minister of Health of the Russian Federation
has stated that the mortality indicators for influenza do not exceed
the level of last year [2008]. She also rejected recent news
concerning 3 H1N1 [presumably pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infections]
deaths in Moscow and added that the official statistics indicate that
[in Russia] there have been about 4563 cases of swine flu and 19
fatalities. Most of these deaths have been due to pneumonia as a
complication of influenza.

Mortality from influenza was high during last year as well; 484
people died from pneumonia during the flu epidemic season in 2008.
The number of deaths from pneumonia this year is 439 and it could be
said that it's no different compared with the last year.

Yesterday [9 Nov 2009] the immunization program for [pandemic?]
influenza A/H1N1 started in Russia with 15 000 people inoculated
mostly in Altay Krai.

[The Altai Krai is a federal subject of Russia (a krai) in the
Siberian Federal District. It borders with, clockwise from the south,
Kazakhstan, the Novosibirsk and Kemerovo Oblasts, and the Altai
Republic (a distinct region from the Altai Krai). The Krai's
administrative center is the city of Barnaul. The Krai's economy
depends on agriculture. The Altai Krai can be located in the map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Krai>. It is not immediately
obvious why the vaccination programme is being initiated in this
region of Russia. - Mod.CP]
