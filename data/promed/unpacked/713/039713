Vietnam bans all imports of poultry as bird flu spreads
-------------------------------------------------------
Vietnam has banned all imports of poultry as the epidemic of bird flu,
which has killed at least 4 people since the beginning of the month, spread
to the whole country.
"Imports of poultry and poultry products from neighbouring countries have
to be temporarily suspended," the state-controlled Vietnam News Agency
(VNA) said, quoting an order from Prime Minister Phan Van Khai. (See 2nd item).
"Imported poultry and poultry products must be seized and destroyed under
the guidance of specialised agencies, and the owners will receive no
compensation and have to pay fees for poultry killing," it added.
In the past 2 weeks 4 people -- 2 women aged 16 and 18 and 2 boys aged 6
and 9 -- have died of the virus. 2 other women, aged 35 and 18, remained
in hospital Tuesday [18 Jan 2005] after testing positive for the
virus. Several suspected cases were also reported.
According to VNA, over 250 000 birds have been culled since December 2004.
18 of the country's 64 provinces and cities, including the capital Hanoi,
have been hit by outbreaks.
Khai called Monday on authorities to prevent the transport of poultry in
and out of infected areas, and to tighten control over poultry
slaughtering, processing and transporting even in non-affected areas.
The latest outbreak came ahead of next month's Lunar New Year holidays,
when demand for poultry is expected to boom.
World Health Organisation director in Vietnam, Hans Troedsson, said last
week that officials had promised they would carry out necessary culls
despite the surge in demand for poultry over the holiday period.
"The good news is that so far, the virus does not seem to have mutated and
become stronger than last year," Troedsson said.
Since late 2003, at least 24 people in Vietnam have died after contracting
the H5N1 strain. The real figure is thought to be higher, as tests were not
carried out on some suspected cases.

PM: Intensified measures to stamp out bird flu epidemic
-------------------------------------------------
Prime Minister Phan Van Khai on Monday [17 Jan 2005] asked all relevant
agencies and local authorities across the country to take 4 necessary
measures to curb the spread of bird flu, which is hitting the Mekong Delta
and southeast region.
The Prime Minister expressed concern over the return and fast spread of the
epidemic, especially the lethal H5N1 virus, which has taken several lives
in a short time and is threatening the poultry industry and people's health.
He urged the People's Committees of provinces and cities, as well as
relevant ministries and agencies, to mobilise all human resources and take
the firmest measures to control and stamp out the epidemic.
The PM identified the following 4 urgent measures:
- to totally cull all poultry stocks in which any birds died of the
disease, or which are discovered to be infected with the virus following
confirmation by responsible experts; and to isolate and disinfect areas of
high risk according to the veterinary review.
- veterinary agencies, police forces, market managers and local authorities
are asked to strictly prevent the transport of poultry and poultry products
out of and into infected areas. Chairpersons of People's Committees at all
levels must be responsible for enforcing the ban on poultry transport out
of and into areas with outbreaks of avian flu.
- control over poultry slaughtering, processing and transporting must be
tightened in unaffected areas as well.
- imports of poultry and poultry products from neighbouring countries have
to be temporarily suspended. Imported poultry and poultry products must be
seized and destroyed under the guidance of specialised agencies and the
owners will receive no compensation and have to pay fees for the killing of
their poultry. [The neighbours of Viet Nam are (from south to north)
Cambodia, Laos, and China. - Mod.AS]
The Ministry of Health is instructed to quickly review and provide medical
facilities for emergency cases and local medical establishments for
on-the-spot treatment of infected patients. It must actively prevent the
spread of the epidemic.
According to the Veterinary Department, by Monday, the epidemic spread to
136 communes of 62 districts in 18 cities and provinces, including Lam
Dong, Binh Phuoc, Ben Tre, Tien Giang, Long An, Dong Thap, Can Tho, Bac
Lieu, Hau Giang, Tra Vinh, An Giang, Ca Mau, Ha Nam, Hanoi, Tay Ninh, Dong
Nai, Ninh Thuan and Quang Nam. A total of 75 454 chickens, 73 703 geese,
and 104 850 quail have been culled between 1-16 Jan 2005.

Ho Chi Minh City: tougher measures to examine and cope with "hot spots"

Nearly 1200 ducks from Tran Van Thanh's family and 270 ducks from Le Van
Hien's family were culled in the ancient town of Hoi An in the central
province of Quang Nam on Monday [17 Jan 2005]. Almost all the duck samples
tested positive for bird flu virus. Local authorities and relevant agencies
immediately intensified tough measures to cope with the situation, such as
quarantines and banning the slaughtering, trading and transporting of
poultry suspected to have contracted the fatal disease.

Da Nang: banning poultry trading in big markets
-----------------------------------------
The Da Nang Provincial People's Committee has decided to ban poultry

allowed to sell poultry meat supplied by centralised slaughterhouses. In
addition, Da Nang has also set up 5 checkpoints to stop poultry transport
from affected areas to the city. The city will only accept poultry brought
in from central coastal Khanh Hoa province northwards that has quarantine
certificates.

[Since our previous update of 13 Jan 2005, when 16 provinces/cities were
reportedly affected, 2 provinces have been added. Unfortunately, the
situation returns to square 1 of early 2004: outbreaks in southern, central
and northern Viet Nam. An updated (14 Jan 2005) map, depicting the AI
