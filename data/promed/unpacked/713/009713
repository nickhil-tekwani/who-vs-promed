Vets warn that the potentially fatal lungworm parasite _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ has reached endemic proportions, with 150 veterinary practices across the UK reporting 952 suspected cases and 81 deaths caused by the parasite this year [2013] alone.

The parasite, carried by common slugs and snails found in the typical UK garden, is thriving, thanks to last year's [2012] 2nd-wettest weather on record and this year's damp spring.

Evidence from the Royal Veterinary College suggests the parasite has spread across the UK, from its traditional habitat in the south, to the northern regions, with one in 5 vet practices reporting at least one case of the parasite.

Further research among 2000 UK dog owners by Bayer Animal Health discovered that 84 per cent do not know the symptoms of the parasite, and 50 per cent do not know the risks of infection.

Dogs can become infected by unsuspectingly eating slugs or snails carrying the lungworm larvae. Once inside the dog's system, the parasite travels through the body eventually ending up in the heart. Untreated, the dog's health can rapidly deteriorate, often resulting in death.

Routine use of a specific treatment, available from veterinary surgeons, prevents dogs from developing a lungworm infection. Some pet owners believe that lungworm can be prevented using conventional worming tablets, which is, unfortunately, not the case.

[_Angiostrongylus vasorum_, also known as French heartworm, is a metastrongylid nematode parasite that resides in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of dogs and other canids. The presence of the parasite has been reported in Europe (Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the UK), Africa (Uganda), South America (Brazil and Columbia) and Canada (Newfoundland). It is widely assumed that foxes act as a reservoir of infection for dogs.

Although clinical signs in association with _A vasorum_ infection in dogs can be variable, they typically represent 3 main syndromes: cardiorespiratory signs, coagulopathies and neurological dysfunction.

The disease is increasingly diagnosed in dogs, as the geographic range of the parasite increases along with awareness among clinicians. Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention are not always straightforward, although recent developments offer hope for improved options in future. Understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis remains poor. For a paper providing an overview of the current state of knowledge of this parasitic disease focusing on recent developments and advances, see:
E. Morgan & S. Shaw (2010). _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ infection in dogs: continuing spread and developments in diagnosis and treatment. J Sm Animal Practice (2010) 51, 616-621.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-5827.2010.01000.x/full.

The paper presents the following concluding remarks:

"_A. vasorum_ is an emerging parasite of dogs, as it spreads from known endemic foci. Clinician awareness is an important defence against this disease, which can be severe and difficult to diagnose definitively. Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, and current tests for parasitological diagnosis suffer from poor sensitivity, signs associated with infection are well described and should alert clinicians to the possibility of infection. Climatic models suggest that there is substantial scope for further geographical spread, so practitioners in areas not currently considered endemic should be vigilant. There are effective drugs for the treatment of _A. vasorum_, and early anthelmintic [anti-parasite] therapy of uncomplicated respiratory cases of mild or moderate severity has excellent prognosis for full recovery. More severe or unusual presentations, including bleeding disorders, can present a greater challenge. Regular anthelmintic treatment is likely to reduce, but might not eliminate, the risk of disease. While increasing numbers of dogs will be at risk of infection as the geographical range of the parasite expands, better epidemiological understanding and increasing options for diagnosis and treatment have the potential to improve prospects for disease prevention and management in the longer term." - Mod.AS
