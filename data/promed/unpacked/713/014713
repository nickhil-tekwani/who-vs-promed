Mumps outbreak in Bulgaria, 2007: a preliminary report
-----------------------------------------------
There is an ongoing mumps outbreak in Bulgaria, with a total of 997
cases notified between 1 Jan and 18 Mar 2007. This number includes
laboratory-confirmed and probable epidemiologically-linked clinical
cases in line with the EU case definition and case classification
that have been adopted for mumps surveillance purposes in Bulgaria
since 2005 [1].
For comparison, only 22 cases were reported in the 1st 11 weeks of
2005, and 311 cases were registered in the same period in 2006.
Altogether, 608 cases were notified in 2005, and 919 cases were
reported during 2006. An increase of the number of reported cases was
noted already in 2006, and since the beginning of 2007, the number of
cases has continued to rise. [The text at this point is supplemented
by a figure plotting reported mumps cases during weeks 1 to 11 in
2005 (n=22), 2006 (n=311) and 2007 (n=997)].
The present mumps epidemic affects mostly teenagers and young adults.
More than 60 percent of the cases reported in 2007 occurred in
patients aged 15 to 19 years, and about 20 percent in patients aged
20 to 24 years. To date, 112 out of 997 cases (11.2 percent) have
been laboratory-confirmed.
Conclusion
----------
The outbreak investigation is still ongoing, but preliminary data
indicate that the predominance of patients in age groups 15-19 and
20-24 years may be a result of poor immunisation of these birth
cohorts in general. About 1/3rd of patients aged 15 to 19 years have
not been vaccinated at all, whereas more than half have received only
one dose of monovalent mumps vaccine strain Leningrad 3, which has
been shown to have a lower effectiveness [2]. Among the 20- to
24-year-old patients, over 90 percent have never been immunised against mumps.
Vaccination against mumps in Bulgaria started in 1972, and a routine
mumps immunisation program was launched in 1976. However, different
vaccine strains and vaccines have been used, and different
immunisation strategies implemented, including a suspension of mumps
immunisation for almost 4 years during the period 1982 to 1986.
Due to the past changes in the immunisation program and occasionally
incomplete immunisation coverage, the conditions in which outbreaks
can occur still exist, despite the current up-to-date mumps
immunisation strategy.
Control measures
----------------
A risk assessment carried out following the outbreak concluded that
birth cohorts 1982 to 1992 that are at higher risk of mumps infection
should be offered supplementary mumps immunisation.
As a result, the Bulgarian Ministry of Health decided to provide
supplementary doses of MMR vaccine and to conduct immunisation
campaigns targeted at these cohorts. In early March 2007, the
Ministry of Health organized a meeting to inform regional
epidemiologists about the situation and to discuss with them the need
for strengthening disease surveillance and undertaking control
measures to prevent further spread of mumps. Furthermore,
communication aimed at the general public, conveying information
about the risks related to mumps infection and the preventive
measures, including immunisation, has been intensified through the
participation of national experts in a series of briefings, TV and
radio broadcasts.
A longer article on the epidemiology of mumps in Bulgaria, including
a detailed risk assessment, is planned for publication in the monthly
release of Eurosurveillance.

[Outbreaks of mumps still occur sporadically throughout Europe as a
result of incomplete vaccine coverage in the past, particularly in
countries with significant migrant Roma populations that may escape
routine immunisation programs. The inclusion of a sub-optimal mump
component in triple MMR vaccine in the past may be another factor
affecting the efficacy of vaccination. (E.g. Higher rates of aseptic
meningitis have been attributed to the Urabe, Leningrad-Zagreb and
Leningrad-3 strain vaccines compared with the current Jeryl-Lynn strain vaccine
