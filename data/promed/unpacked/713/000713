Rain brings barley scald to the Wimmera
---------------------------------------
While the Wimmera region of Western Victoria is having its best cropping
season for a decade, the barley fungal disease, scald, is as well. Wetter
conditions coming into the warmer months have provided ideal conditions for
scald, which has the potential to reduce yields significantly if it isn't
controlled.

Senior plant pathologist with the Department of Primary Industries in
Horsham, Grant Holloway, says earlier sown crops are more susceptible to
scald, and only certain varieties are vulnerable. "Left uncontrolled, given
the ideal conditions, those crops without protection could end up with no
green leaf area left on them in a few weeks' time. And yields could be
reduced by 30 per cent or more in severely infected crops."

[Scald (or leaf blotch) caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of the
most destructive diseases of barley, particularly in wet conditions. It can
decrease yield by up to 40 per cent and reduces grain quality. Symptoms
include lesions on leaves and leaf sheaths which later merge into large
areas of dead tissue and may destroy the whole green leaf area of the
plant. The pathogen can also cause symptomless seed infection, which leads
to a high risk of spread.

Scald is a polycyclic disease, with the primary inoculum produced on crop
debris and infected seeds. Secondary disease spread occurs primarily by
splashing rain. The fungus is highly variable in pathogenicity,
specificity, morphology, colour, isozymes and DNA molecular markers, and a
sexual stage is likely to exist. Management strategies include cultural
practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides, and use of clean seed. No durable
single major resistance genes for scald are known. Field resistance appears
to be substantially polygenic which makes resistance breeding difficult.
