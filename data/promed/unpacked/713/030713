The head sanitary doctor of Kaluga oblast reports that the epidemic
situation regarding Lyme disease remains unfavorable there.

There were 148 registered cases in 2009, which equates to 14.72 cases per
100 000 population. The doctors consider the rise in incidence to be
connected to more gardening, tourism development, and urbanization of
endemic lands. Unauthorized landfills also contribute their part. Landfills
are feeding places for many rodents which carry ticks. All this has caused
an expansion of the endemic areas.

15.7 per cent of tested ticks were found positive for Lyme disease in 2009.
2307 tick bites were reported in 2009, including 369 children, comparied
with 1760 tick bites in 2008 (including 489 children).

The specialists consider that the level of insecticide land treatment
against ticks is inadequate.

The average incidence of Lyme disease in Russia was 6.82/100 000 in 2009
(9686 cases). The highest incidence was registered in Ural and Northwest
federal okrugs [districts].

[Lyme disease is endemic for 72 federal administrative divisions of Russia
(out of 83). The area of Lyme disease spread is much wider than tickborne
encephalitis. The most prevalent vectors are taiga ticks (_Ixodes
persulcatus_) and forest ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_). The taiga ticks have
more epidemiological significance and occur from the Leningrad and Novgorod
regions in the west to Southern Sakhalin in the east. The natural infection
rate in ticks ranges from 3 to 90 per cent. Most infections occur in
working age people and in schoolchildren during forest trips and garden
work. - Mod.NP

In the USA, the average annual rate for the 3-year 2003-5 period in 10
reference states where the disease is endemic is 29.2 cases per 100 000
population, which is about 3 times the Healthy People 2010 target of 9.7
new cases per 100 000 population
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm>). The United
States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported about 20 000
new cases each year for the country as a whole for an approximate annual
incidence of 6.6 per 100 000 population. As noted in a prior ProMED-mail
post "Lyme disease - Russia (Pskov) (02): background 20061027.3063", the
incidence rates in Russia are strikingly similar to those in the USA
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/Lyme-Russia1.jpg>.

From Mod.MS's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post [Lyme disease - Russia
(Pskov) (02): background 20061027.3063]: "With regard to the comment on
tick control in the previous post 20061026.3059, insecticidal spraying with
sulfur or sulfur compounds is an outdated method. Acaricides (i.e.
insecticides used to control ticks) usually involve organophosphates,
carbamates or pyrethroid insecticides, and are mainly used against ticks of
cattle and other livestock, i.e. veterinary dosing with acaricides. It is
generally believed that spraying ticks involved in transmission of Lyme
disease is not appropriate, it being too difficult to locate places where
ticks are. Good insect repellents are a better approach for personal
protection."

Kaluga oblast is a region on the northwestern edge of the central Russian
upland, southwest of Moscow, with a population of about one million. Over
40 per cent is covered with mixed forests. Industries include car
manufacturing, nuclear power generation and dairy farming, pig breeding,
and cultivation of potatoes and flax
(<http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Kaluga>). Kaluga oblast can be found on a
