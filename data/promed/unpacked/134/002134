According to British Health Officials, there may be a 'superbug' gonorrhea strain spreading across UK, making it harder for medical professionals to treat people with this sexually transmitted infection (STI). Officials noted a dramatic increase in patients with gonorrhea, stating that there are about 21 000 new cases in 2011, which is a 25 percent increase from the year before.

The United Kingdom Health Protection Agency (HPA) stated that a third of these cases occurred in gay men and that more than a third of the total number of cases have already contracted this STI previously. "We are seriously concerned about continuing high levels of gonorrhea transmission and repeat infection," the head of the HPA's STI surveillance, Gwenda Hughes, commented to Reuters.

Gonorrhea is usually treated with one shot of the antibiotics that have a 95 percent effectiveness rate. However, the venereal disease appears to have developed a higher resistance toward some of the more commonly used drug treatments. Treatments involving antibiotics, such as cephalosporins, are becoming less and less effective for certain strains of the disease. This finding only adds on to the many cases worldwide regarding a drug-resistant strain of gonorrhea. In 2011, scientists stated that there was a strain of gonorrhea found in Japan in 2008 that was resistant to all of the recommended antibiotic treatments at the time. Just last year [2012], the World Health Organization noted that the drug-resistant strain is apparent throughout the world.

Gonorrhea is one of the most common STIs in the world with the most cases found in south and southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that gonorrhea cases totaled 700 000 a year. When left undiagnosed and untreated, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, which is pregnancy that occurs outside of the uterus, stillbirths, and infertility.

England has launched a Gonorrhea Resistance Action Plan with the goal of increasing the awareness about the STI. The campaign will continue to monitor the cases from the past 10 years in order to find patterns that may help with prevention. Gonorrhea is the 2nd most common bacterial STI in England.

The bacteria strain appears to have mutated and if the disease continues to grow its resistance toward the available antibiotic treatments against it, the STI can threaten global health.

[Gonorrhea is a major cause of serious reproductive complications in women and can facilitate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. The latest CDC data for sexually transmitted disease caused by _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ show that while reported rates were at historically low levels in the United States, cases increased slightly from 2009 to 2010 and more than 300 000 cases were reported in 2010. However, the CDC estimates that fewer than half of gonococcal infections occurring in the US are diagnosed and reported. There are also signs from CDC surveillance systems that the disease has become resistant to several of the antibiotics previously available as treatment options (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/trends.htm).

Ceftriaxone, an injectable 3rd generation cephalosporin, is the most effective cephalosporin for treatment of gonorrhea, but the percentage of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates with elevated minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to cephalosporins has been rising (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6026a2.htm). Resistance of _N. gonorrhoeae_ to cefixime, an oral cephalosporin used to treat gonorrhea, reported in approximately 30 percent isolates in Japan, led to withdrawal of cefixime in Japan for the treatment of gonorrhea. (See ProMED-mail posting Antibiotic resistance, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - Japan: ceftriaxone 20110713.2114). Similarly in the UK, reduced susceptibility to cefixime was noted in nearly 20 percent of cases in 2010, compared with just 10 percent of cases in 2009 (ProMED-mail posting Antibiotic resistance, Neisseria gonorrhoeae - UK: cefixime 20111012.3051). In the UK, the recommended treatment for uncomplicated anogenital gonococcal infection in adults is ceftriaxone 500 mg IM as a single dose with azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose (http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAweb&Page&HPAwebAutoListName/Page/1221117908959). Cefixime 400 mg oral as a single dose is only recommended if an intramuscular injection is contra-indicated or refused by the patient and is always accompanied by azithromycin 1 g oral as a single dose.

In the United States, in an attempt to forestall loss of ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonococcal disease and anticipating the emergence of resistance to cefixime before resistance to ceftriaxone, the CDC has recommended the routine use of the combination of 2 anti-gonococcal antibiotics, ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly plus azithromycin 1 g orally (preferably) or doxycycline for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea.

The following is extracted from the CDC 2010 Sexually Transmitted Diseases Surveillance information that is available at http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats10/gonorrhea.htm:

The CDC recommends the substitution of a drug in treatment regimens for gonococcal disease when the rate of resistance to that drug is 5 percent or higher in a general community so that all recommended treatments for gonorrhea can be expected to cure greater than 95 percent of gonococcal infections.

Only ceftriaxone meets the CDC's efficacy standards. Because of experience with other microbes that have developed antimicrobial resistance rapidly, combination therapy using 2 antimicrobials with different mechanisms of action is recommended to improve treatment efficacy and potentially delay emergence and spread of resistance to ceftriaxone.

Based on data from CDC's Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), the CDC recommends combination therapy with ceftriaxone 250 mg intramuscularly and either azithromycin 1 g orally as a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days as the most reliably effective treatment for uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm). The use of azithromycin as the 2nd antimicrobial is preferred to doxycycline because of the convenience and compliance advantages of single-dose therapy and the substantially higher prevalence of gonococcal resistance to tetracycline than to azithromycin among GISP isolates, particularly in strains with elevated cefixime MICs (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

The 250 mg IM dose ceftriaxone cures 99.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal and 98.9 percent of pharyngeal infections in published clinical trials. A 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone is now recommended over a 125 mg dose given the 1) increasingly wide geographic distribution of isolates demonstrating decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins in vitro, 2) reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures, 3) improved efficacy of ceftriaxone 250 mg in pharyngeal infection (which is often unrecognized), and 4) the utility of having a simple and consistent recommendation for treatment regardless of the anatomic site involved.

When ceftriaxone cannot be used for treatment of urogenital or rectal gonorrhea, 2 alternative options are available: cefixime 400 mg orally plus either azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally for 7 days if ceftriaxone is not readily available, or azithromycin 2 g orally in a single dose if ceftriaxone cannot be given because of severe allergy. However, if either of these alternative regimens is prescribed, then the patient should return in one week for a test-of-cure at the site of infection (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/GonorrheaTreatmentGuidelinesFactSheet8-9-2012.pdf).

Because of GISP data of declining cefixime susceptibility among urethral _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates collected in the United States during 2006-2011, the CDC no longer recommends cefixime at any dose as a 1st-line regimen for treatment of gonococcal infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

Spectinomycin, which is useful in persons who cannot tolerate cephalosporins, is expensive, must be injected, and is not available in the United States. However, it has been effective in published clinical trials, curing 98.2 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal gonococcal infections. Spectinomycin has poor efficacy against pharyngeal infection (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/STD-Treatment-2010-RR5912.pdf).

Because of the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance, fluoroquinolones are no longer recommended for treatment of gonococcal infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5614a3.htm).
