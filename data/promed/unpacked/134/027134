CJD (NEW VARIANT), CASE RATE STABILIZED - UK

Cases of a new form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have appeared at a steady
rate in the UK between 1994 to 1997, according to government scientists.
New variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD), a degenerative neurological
disease that is invariably fatal, is thought by some researchers to be
linked to the agent that causes "mad cow" disease.
The scientists confirm that there is, as yet, no evidence that prior medical
treatment, occupation or diet are risk factors for nvCJD. This conclusion is
based on an analysis of data from a study of 23 of the new variant CJD cases
compared with 19 controls.
"Currently, cases of nvCJD appear to be occurring at a steady rate," write
the scientists in the 1997 sixth annual report of the National CJD
Surveillance Unit, based in Edinburgh, Scotland. As previously reported by
Reuters, 24 persons have died from nvCJD in Britain as of February 28th.
In contrast, the researchers report an increase in the number of cases of
sporadic CJD, (non-familial CJD) in England and Wales between 1970 and 1997.
They observed an increase in incidence of sporadic CJD among people aged
older than 70 years, but note that this may be due to more physicians
recognizing the disease rather than a real rise in incidence.
In addition, the findings suggest occupation was not a risk factor for
sporadic CJD. Some statistical association was found between the risk of
acquiring CJD and certain meat and animal products. But these associations
should be treated cautiously because of problems obtaining accurate
historical data on diets, the researchers say.
Between 1970 and 1997, the government identified 31 cases of iatrogenic CJD,
or CJD that is caused or acquired through medical treatment. Of this number,
6 involved dura mater implants and 25 involved receipt of the growth
hormone, gonadotrophin, the researchers write.
Mortality rates from the disease in England, Scotland and Wales are,
respectively, 0.7, 0.8 and 1.2 per million persons per year. The highest
rates have been observed in southwest England, the researchers report no
evidence of clustering of cases with regard to location or time.
