[On 12 Nov 2003, an outbreak of gastroenteritis was reported by ProMED-mail
in Guangzhou, China [Viral gastroenteritis update 2003 (24) Archive number
20031112.2801]. It was stated to be viral,.and fever, vomiting and diarrhea
were said to be the symptoms. The article below reports that the cause was
probably staphylococcal food poisoning, but that diagnosis must be suspect
and viral gastroenteritis more likely if fever was really present. See Mod
comment below - Mod.DK].
Recently, the media reported the occurrence of a viral gastroenteritis
outbreak of unknown identity, caused by a new virus of extremely strong
viability. The Guangzhou Municipal Health Bureau has conducted
investigations of relevant conditions and yesterday publicized its
findings: Experts preliminarily believe the cause of this illness is
_Staphylococcus aureus_, but have not ruled out viral gastroenteritis.
After treatment of the illness by concerned experts, the symptoms of sick
students resolved within 1-2 days. Among them the longest course of the
illness was 4 days. At this point, all patients have completely recovered.
After the outbreak, disease control departments immediately conducted
thorough cleaning and disinfection of the school cafeteria and conducted
physical exams of cafeteria employees. After adopting these measures, the
outbreak was quickly brought under control. After 29 Oct 2003 there were
no further cases. Relevant samples have already been sent to the Guangdong
provincial disease control center for further testing.

[Clinically, perhaps the best differential feature between a viral
gastroenteritis and staphylococcal food poisoning is the consistent absence
of fever with the staphylococcal disease. The process is caused by
ingestion of preformed staphylococcal enterotoxin B in food contaminated
with a toxin-producing strain of _S. aureus_. It is important to note,
however, that staphylococcal enterotoxin B -- when administered by aerosol
-- manifests initially as fever and chills with subsequent respiratory
symptoms. Viral gastroenteritis may spread from person to person, whereas
the staphylococcal toxin disease is foodborne. - Mod.LL]
