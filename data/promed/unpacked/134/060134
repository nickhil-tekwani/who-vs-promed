_Trypanosoma cruzi_ (Chagas disease) infection in Texas wildlife
----------------------------------------------------------------
It's a deadly disease long associated with Latin America, but local researchers are now seeing a spike in cases right here in south Texas. Found almost exclusively in Latin America, Chagas disease is mainly transmitted by an insect known as "the kissing bug".

"In Latin America, when they would feed on humans, it prefers to feed around the eyes and mouth," says wildlife biologist Troy Luepke.

"So there are millions of people in Latin American countries that are actually infected with the disease," says Dr Roel Lopez of Texas A&M University. So why are researchers trapping kissing bugs right here in south Texas? While not new to the region, the bugs are being found at a rate never seen before. "The overall risk of transmission has increased," says Dr Lopez.

Lopez is heading up this research. He thinks warmer weather from climate change is allowing more of the bugs to head north. For the past year, Troy Luepke has been setting up traps on public land like military bases and state parks, looking for mammals that may have been infected.

"Wood rats and rabbits to raccoons, feral hogs and white tail deer." The results from those traps may surprise you. "60 to 80 per cent of the animals we sampled have been infected," says Dr Lopez. Lopez says they're still in the very early stages of research. "And so it's through that process we can better understand the level of risk to people in that environment."

"Where the insects prefer to live, what hosts they prefer to be around," adds Luepke.

They don't want people to be alarmed by these findings. They want them to be more aware of the bugs. To be cautious. "Very similar to what you would do to keep your kids from getting bit by mosquitoes," says Dr Lopez.

It's estimated more than 300 thousand Latin Americans infected with Chagas disease currently live here in the US. But you can go years, if not decades, before showing any symptoms.

It's thought many in Latin America are more susceptible to the bugs because of more rural, less modern housing.

[_Trypanosoma cruzi_ causing Chagas diseases is uncommon in northern Mexico (Escamilla-Guerrero G, et al. Trypanosoma cruzi: seroprevalence detected in the blood bank of the Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, Mexico City, in the period 2004 through 2009. Transfusion. 2012;52(3):595-600), but with increasing density of the triatome vector in the southern United States the risk of human infection could increase. Indeed ProMED-mail reported a human case apparently infected in Louisiana in 2007. However, the risk of infection depends on contact between humans and the vector.

A recent study from the southern United States reported 7 known autochthonous human cases of Chagas plus 16 new presumed cases (Reisenman CE, et al. The distribution and abundance of triatomine insects, potential vectors of Chagas disease, in a metropolitan area in southern Arizona, United States. J Med Entomol. 2012;49(6):1254-61). The study also reported that "55-60 per cent of the triatomines were collected inside houses, and 30-35 per cent of those were found in or near beds; thus, it is likely that they fed on humans." - Mod.EP
