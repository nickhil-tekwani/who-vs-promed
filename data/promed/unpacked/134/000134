The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended Tuesday [27 Jul 2021] that fully vaccinated people begin wearing masks indoors again in places with high COVID-19 transmission rates. The agency is also recommending kids wear masks in schools this fall [2021].

Federal health officials still believe fully vaccinated individuals represent a very small amount of transmission. Still, some vaccinated people could be carrying higher levels of the virus than previously understood and potentially transmit it to others.

"This pandemic continues to pose a serious threat to the health of all Americans," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters on a call. "Today, we have new science related to the delta variant that requires us to update the guidance regarding what you can do when you are fully vaccinated."

The updated guidance comes ahead of the fall season, when the highly contagious delta variant is expected to cause another surge in new coronavirus cases and many large employers plan to bring workers back to the office. In mid-May [2021], the CDC said fully vaccinated people didn't need to wear masks in most settings, whether indoors or outdoors.

"In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks in public, indoor settings to help prevent the spread of the delta variant and protect others. This includes schools," Walensky said. The CDC recommends that everyone in grade schools wear masks indoors, "including teachers, staff, students and visitors, regardless of vaccination status."

Walensky said new data [show] the variant behaves "uniquely differently from past strains of the virus," indicating that some vaccinated people infected with the delta variant "may be contagious and spread the virus to others."

Health experts fear delta, already the dominant form of the disease in the USA, is hitting states with low vaccination rates. Those states are now being forced to reintroduce mask rules, capacity limits and other public health measures that they've largely rolled back in recent months.

White House chief medical advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday [25 Jul 2021] that the CDC was considering whether to revise mask guidance for vaccinated Americans, saying it was "under active consideration."

"It's a dynamic situation. It's a work in progress, it evolves like in so many other areas of the pandemic," Fauci, also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN. "You've got to look at the data.

The CDC's guidance is only a recommendation, leaving it up to states and local officials on whether to reintroduce their mask rules for certain people. But even before the CDC's anticipated guidance Tuesday [27 Jul 2021], some regions were reintroducing mask mandates and advisories as COVID cases began to spike again.

Walensky said a majority of the hospitalizations and deaths in the USA are occurring among unvaccinated people, pointing to vaccines she said worked well in protecting against severe illness and death. "But the big concern is that the next variant that might emerge, we're just a few mutations potentially away where it could potentially evade our vaccines," she said.

President Joe Biden said the CDC's updated guidance was necessary to defeat the virus, and that he will lay out "next steps" to get more Americans vaccinated on Thursday [29 Jul 2021]. "Although most US adults are vaccinated, too many are not. While we have seen an increase in vaccinations in recent days, we still need to do better," he said in a statement. "More vaccinations and mask wearing in the areas most impacted by the delta variant will enable us to avoid the kind of lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, and disruptions we faced in 2020."

Several counties across California and Nevada were already advising all residents to wear masks in public indoor settings -- whether they are vaccinated or not. In Massachusetts, officials in Provincetown advised all individuals to resume wearing masks indoors after Fourth of July celebrations led to an outbreak of new cases.

Experts say COVID prevention strategies remain critical to protect people from the virus, especially in areas of moderate-to-high community transmission levels. The CDC defines "substantial transmission" as counties that have 50-100 cases per 100 000 residents over a 7-day period and "high transmission" is more than 100 cases per 100 000 people over 7 days, Walensky said.

"We have places and counties and states here that are now reporting over 300 cases per 100 000 over a 7-day period. So really an extraordinary amount of viral transmission, which is what we're concerned about," she added.

Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine advocate who has served on advisory panels for both the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), told CNBC earlier this month [July 2021] that the USA was still "undervaccinated," with about half of the population not fully inoculated. Even people who are fully protected have cause for concern when it comes to COVID variants, Offit said. While the vaccines protect well against severe disease and death, they may not protect as well against mild disease or spreading COVID to others, he said. No vaccine is 100% effective, he noted.

"It is not a bold prediction to believe that SARS-CoV-2 is going to be circulating 2 or 3 years from now. I mean there are 195 countries out there, most of which haven't been given a single dose of vaccine," Offit said. "Will it still be circulating in the United States? I think that would be very, very likely."

Israel released preliminary data last week that showed the Pfizer vaccine is just 39% effective against the virus there, which officials attributed to the rapidly spreading delta variant. Its effectiveness against severe disease and death remained high, the data showed. US and world health officials said they are looking at the Israeli research, which was not peer-reviewed and was scant on details.

Executives from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have said they expect Americans will need booster shots, and Pfizer has said it plans to ask the FDA to authorize boosters as it sees signs of waning immunity. Federal health officials say booster doses of the vaccines are not needed for otherwise healthy people at this time, although they may recommend it for the elderly or people with compromised immunity.

[B] CDC changes course on indoor masks in some parts of the USA
Date: Tue 27 Jul 2021 17:30 EDT
Source: Boston Globe [edited]
https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/07/27/nation/cdc-will-recommend-that-some-vaccinated-people-wear-masks-indoors-again/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed course Tuesday [27 Jul 2021] on some masking guidelines, recommending that even vaccinated people return to wearing masks indoors in parts of the USA where the delta variant of the coronavirus is fueling infection surges.

Citing new information about the variant's ability to spread among vaccinated people, the CDC also recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors at schools nationwide, regardless of vaccination status.

"We have new science related to the delta variant that requires us to update the guidance," for vaccinated people, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday [27 Jul 2021]. "Recent outbreak investigations show that the delta variant behaves uniquely differently," Walensky said. "In areas with substantial and high transmission, CDC recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks."

Five counties in Massachusetts -- Suffolk, Bristol, Barnstable, Nantucket, and Dukes -- fall under the CDC's classification of "substantial and high."

In other developments, President Joe Biden said his administration was considering requiring all federal workers to get vaccinated. His comments came a day after the Department of Veterans Affairs became the 1st federal agency to require its healthcare workers receive the vaccine.

Biden dismissed concerns that the new masking guidance from the CDC could invite confusion, saying Americans who remain unvaccinated are the ones who are "sowing enormous confusion."

"The more we learn about this virus and the delta variation, the more we have to be worried and concerned. And there's only one thing we know for sure -- if those other 100 million people got vaccinated, we'd be in a very different world," he said.

The White House quickly pivoted on its own masking guidance, asking all staff and reporters to wear masks indoors because the latest CDC data [show] that Washington faces a substantial level of coronavirus transmission.

The new mask guidance follows recent decisions in Los Angeles and St. Louis to revert to indoor mask mandates amid a spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations that have been especially bad in the South. The country is averaging more than 57 000 cases a day and 24 000 COVID-19 hospitalizations.

The guidance on masks in indoor public places applies in parts of the country with at least 50 new cases per 100 000 people in the last week. That includes 60% percent of US counties, officials said.

Most new infections in the USA continue to be among unvaccinated people. So-called breakthrough infections, which generally cause milder illness, can occur in vaccinated people. When earlier strains of the virus predominated, infected vaccinated people were found to have low levels of virus and were deemed unlikely to spread the virus much, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.

But with the delta variant, the level of virus in infected vaccinated people is "indistinguishable" from the level of virus in the noses and throats of unvaccinated people, Walensky said.

The data emerged over the last couple of days from over 100 samples from several states and one other country. It is unpublished, and the CDC has not released it. But "it is concerning enough that we feel like we have to act," Walensky said. Vaccinated people "have the potential to spread that virus to others," she said.

For much of the pandemic, the CDC advised Americans to wear masks outdoors if they were within 6 feet of one another. Then in April [2021], as vaccination rates rose sharply, the agency eased its guidelines on the wearing of masks outdoors, saying that fully vaccinated Americans no longer needed to cover their faces unless they were in a big crowd of strangers. In May [2021], the guidance was eased further for fully vaccinated people, allowing them to stop wearing masks outdoors in crowds and in most indoor settings.

The guidance still called for wearing masks in crowded indoor settings, like buses, planes, hospitals, prisons and homeless shelters, but it cleared the way for reopening workplaces and other venues. Subsequent CDC guidance said fully vaccinated people no longer needed to wear masks at schools either.

For months, COVID cases, deaths and hospitalizations were falling steadily, but those trends began to change at the beginning of the summer [2021] as the delta variant, a mutated and more transmissible version of the virus, began to spread widely, especially in areas with lower vaccination rates.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the delta variant has changed the nation's COVID-19 outlook since the CDC relaxed masking recommendations. "That is their job. Their job is to look at evolving information, evolving data, an evolving historic pandemic and provide guidance to the American public," Psaki said. "What has not changed," she added, "is the fact that people who are vaccinated have a huge deal of protection from serious illness, from hospitalization and from death."

Some public health experts said they thought the earlier CDC decision was based on good science. But those experts were also critical, noting that there was no call for Americans to document their vaccination status, which created an honor system. Unvaccinated people who did not want to wear masks in the first place saw it as an opportunity to do what they wanted, they said.

"If all the unvaccinated people were responsible and wore mask indoors, we would not be seeing this surge," said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC disease investigator who now is dean of the University of Nebraska's College of Public Health.

Lawrence Gostin, a public health law professor at Georgetown University, drew a similar conclusion. "It was completely foreseeable that when they (the CDC) made their announcement, masking would no longer be the norm, and that's exactly what's happened," Gostin said.

The CDC may be seen as "flip-flopping," he said, because there's been no widely recognized change in the science, he said. Furthermore, it's not likely to change the behavior of the people who most need to wear masks. "I don't think you can effectively walk that back," he said.

Walensky said she is aware of the criticisms and concerns, and she acknowledged that many Americans are weary of the pandemic and do not want to return to prevention measures. But she said new scientific information forced the decision to change the guidance again. "This is not something that I took lightly," she said.

Ken Thigpen, a retired respiratory therapist who now works for a medical device manufacturer, is fully vaccinated and stopped wearing his mask in public after the CDC changed its guidance in May [2021]. But he started to reconsider in the last week after his job took him to hospitals in Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, where he witnessed medical centers getting inundated with COVID-19 patients.

"That delta variant is intense. It is so transmissible that we have to do something to tamp it down," he said. "I loved it when I could call the hospitals and they said, 'We actually closed our COVID ward today or we are down to 2 COVID patients,'" he recalled. "And now we are opening the wards back up, and the numbers are going nuts."

[C] Explanation of new guidelines
Date: Tue 27 Jul 2921
Source: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]
https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/07/how-to-process-the-new-cdc-mask-guidelines/619584/

The CDC is now recommending fully vaccinated Americans return to wearing masks in indoor spaces in communities where coronavirus transmission is substantial or high. [The author (Caroline Mimbs Nyce [CMN]) spoke with] Katherine J. Wu [KJW] after the agency's press conference today [27 Jul 2021] to help make sense of the new guidelines. She encouraged Americans to see them not as a setback but rather as a par-for-the-course adjustment.

[CMN]: Can you explain a little bit about what we learned about the delta variant today?

[KJW]: The most important thing that the CDC said today is that fully vaccinated people can get infected with delta, carry it in high amounts in their airways, and potentially transmit it to other people. This helps us put the mask recommendation in context. Vaccines are still doing a very good job at preventing severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Breakthrough cases with symptoms remain rare. The question we're asking is, "How are we going to stop transmission of this virus, especially to unvaccinated people?"

[CMN]: How can you know if your area has substantial or high transmission?

[KJW]: The easiest way to tell is to go to the CDC's COVID Data Tracking website and see what places are orange (substantial transmission) or red (high transmission) [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view].

[D] Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on CDC mask guidance
Date: Tue 27 Jul 2021
Source: IDSA [edited]
https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2021/idsa-supports-new-cdc-guidance-on-mask-wearing-as-delta-variant-spreads/


The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) supports guidance announced today [27 Jul 2021] by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommending mask wearing in indoor public settings for all individuals in communities with substantial or high COVID-19 transmission rates, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. To stay ahead of the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant, IDSA also urges that in communities with moderate transmission rates, all individuals, even those who are vaccinated, wear masks in indoor public places.

IDSA also supports CDC's guidance recommending universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status, until vaccines are authorized and widely available to all children and vaccination rates are sufficient to control transmission.

Unfortunately, vaccination rates in most US communities remain far too low to minimize COVID-19 transmission, and it is impossible in public settings to know who is vaccinated and who is not. Vaccination coverage remains below 40% in over half of the counties in the country, and 63% of US counties have high or substantial virus spread, according to CDC. As a result, successful community mitigation measures should be based on local transmission rates, not the vaccine status of individuals.

While COVID-19 vaccines currently in use in the United States are highly effective against the delta variant in preventing serious illness and death, they do not eliminate the possibility that vaccinated people might spread the virus to others.

The overwhelming majority of current COVID-19 cases are occurring in unvaccinated individuals, and significantly increasing vaccination rates are urgently needed to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. Until then, mask wearing will help reduce infections, prevent serious illnesses and death, limit strain on local hospitals and stave off the development of even more troubling variants.

State and local policies requiring mask wearing increased adherence to these measures earlier in the pandemic and will likely need to be reinstated. It is imperative that state and local health officials are empowered to determine the mitigation measures necessary in their communities to end this pandemic.

[2] Japan (Tokyo): record case numbers
Date: Tue 27 Jul 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/7/27/tokyo-hits-record-virus-cases-days-after-olympics-begin


Tokyo has reported its highest number of new coronavirus infections, just days after the start of the Olympic Games. The Japanese capital confirmed 2848 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday [27 Jul 2021], exceeding the earlier record of 2520 cases on 7 Jan [2021], and bringing the city's total to more than 200 000 since the pandemic began last year [2020].

Tokyo is under its 4th state of emergency, which is to continue through the Olympics until just before the Paralympics start in late August [2021].

Experts have warned that the more contagious delta variant could cause a surge during the Games, whose opening ceremony took place on Friday [23 Jul 2021]. They note that cases among younger, unvaccinated people are rising sharply as Japan's inoculation drive loses steam due to supply uncertainty. Many serious cases involve those in their 50s. They now dominate Tokyo's nearly 3000 hospitalised patients and are gradually filling up available beds.

Al Jazeera's Andy Richardson, reporting from Tokyo, said the Games' organisers were keen to detach the event from the latest caseload figures. They say they are in a "separate bubble and what is happening in the metropolitan area doesn't have anything to do with the [Games]," Richardson said.

Kenji Shibuya, a former director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, said it was impossible to quantify to what extent the Olympics contributed to the surge but blamed the global sports showpiece as "one of the major driving forces."

"The government has sent signals that people are supposed to stay home, at the same time they celebrate the Games. It's a totally inconsistent message," said Shibuya, who is now running the vaccine rollout in a town in northern Japan.

Japan's vaccination drive began late and slowly but picked up dramatically in May [2021] for several weeks as the supply of imported vaccines stabilised and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government pushed to inoculate more people before the Olympics. The government says 25.5% of Japanese have been fully vaccinated, still short of the level believed to have any meaningful impact on reducing the risk for the general population.

Yet, Japan has kept its cases and deaths much lower than many other countries. Nationwide, it has reported 870 445 cases and 15 129 deaths as of Monday [26 Jul 2021].

"The frustration among people...is that the reason figures have been low until this point is because of sacrifices they've made, not because of government policy -- and they're getting these mixed messages," Richardson said.

The government has been criticised for what some say is prioritising the Olympics over the nation's health. Suga's public support ratings have fallen to approximately 30% in recent media surveys, and there is little festivity surrounding the Games.

[The Games go on. Only time will tell whether the chance taken in holding the Games was an acceptable risk, and the precautions implemented prevented an exacerbation of the pandemic. It is difficult to determine what the impact of the Games is on the current number of rising cases, but it is concerning as the event continues. - Mod.LK]
