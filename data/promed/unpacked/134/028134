Epidemiological studies are being conducted for an unknown disease with pneumonia-like symptoms [that] occurred at Konkuk University.

The Korean Center for Disease Control & Prevention [KCDC] (director, Yang Byung Guk) said the central epidemiology investigation team was dispatched (on 28 Oct 15) in order to conduct epidemiology studies in Konkuk University, because after 19 Oct 15, unknown-cause pneumonia patients (3 cases) from Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building were reported in Gwangjin-gu Health Center.

KCDC confirmed the unknown-cause pneumonia on the day of (27 Oct 15); the result of the initial epidemiological test from the health center was reported and the central epidemiology investigation team was dispatched to proceed with epidemiology studies in detail; as of 27 Oct 15 evening, 10 more patients were recorded.

As of today (28 Oct 15), according to the central epidemiology investigation team, they confirmed that patients are concentrically from 3 laboratories inside the building, so they will focus on finding co-exposure factors.

From 19-28 Oct 2015, 21 patients showed symptoms such as pneumonia, respiratory symptoms, and fever, and they will receive treatment in the National Inpatient Hospital until the pathogen is confirmed.

Konkuk University will continue the building shutdown until the cause is identified and safety is assured.

KCDC is conducting preventative measures, such as indoor disinfection, in consultation with the university and will obtain a list of building users in order to strengthen monitoring. In addition, they will conduct detailed epidemiological investigations.

As of 29 Oct 2015 0:00 KST, the Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (director, Yang Byung Guk) investigated a total of 31 unknown-cause respiratory disease cases in relation to Konkuk University, which are 10 more cases than the previous day's numbers.

31 patients reported fever and respiratory symptoms, of which 23 patients are receiving treatment from the National Inpatient Hospital, and 8 of them who have relatively minor symptoms are quarantined at home.

According to the epidemiology investigation team, all 31 cases of unknown cause respiratory disease are from the Animal Life Science building, and the outbreak occurred intensively over the past week, which indicates that the situation occurred by common factors associated with the building.

In order to identify the cause, the KCDC proceeded with bacterial and viral testing by collecting patient and environmental samples from the building. Unusual findings have not been confirmed until now.

Test results:
- For the cause, genetic testing and serum antibody tests were conducted on some patients, which were confirmed negative.
- PCR test result negative infectious disease
- respiratory bacteria: mycoplasma, chlamydia, whooping cough, diphtheria
- respiratory viruses: Merck's, adenovirus, RS virus, parainfluenza virus, virus meth pneumophila, Boca virus, influenza virus, coronavirus
- PCR negative [for?] infectious diseases in antibody test progress
Brucellosis, Q fever, Legionella (3 weeks after retesting with convalescent serum)
*Although test came out negative, it is not excluded from the cause of infection, and retest will be conducted according to symptoms.
- Chemical materials and environmental factors, as well as a mass outbreak by infectious pathogens will be investigated from various angles.

Meanwhile, Konkuk University Animal Life Science building was closed down on 28 Oct 2015. People who visited the building from 8-28 Oct 2015 and have fever are encourged to report to the KCDC Call Center (109).
Also, the SK Group held an employment exam at the building on 25 Oct 2015. The SK group instructed 500 applicants to report to the KCDC Call Center (109) if they have unusual symptoms.
- In addition, the KCDC asked the Korean Medical Association and Korean Hospital Association for cooperation to check patients with fever and respiratory symptoms [if] they have ever visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences building.

Report on the 2nd day respiratory disease investigation arising from Konkuk University
------------------------------
The Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (director, Yang Byung Guk) said specific findings were not found from the result of the human samples test (conducted until 29 Oct 15) for 16 species of bacterial and viral pathogens in relation to Konkuk University's respiratory disease outbreak.

One patient was confirmed to be positive for rhinovirus, which is one of the common cold viruses from genetic testing, but it is not common in [to? - Mod.SH] all patients [and] is thought to be irrelevant to the respiratory disease.

In addition, there are no patients confirmed positive for serum antibody test (brucellosis, Q fever, legionella), which shall be reaffirmed through secondary inspection (convalescent serology) after 3 weeks.

In order to research bacterial and viral, as well as environmental and chemical factors, experts from various fields, including infectious diseases and toxicology, will cooperate with an epidemiology investigation team, and the causes of the respiratory disease will be identified through a comprehensive review.

As of 30 Oct 2015 0 PM KST, a total of 45 cases are currently being investigated, and there are confirmed pneumonia radiological patterns in 34 cases who are identified as the suspected patients. They are distributed in 7 hospitals under quarantine and receiving treatment, and they show fever, muscle pain, and mild pneumonia symptoms, but there are no severe cases among 34 so far.

For 11 of them who are currently staying at home, it will be determined whether or not they should be identified as suspected patients and hospitalized after they undergo chest radiography.

*Suspected Patients: people who visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 with fever of 37.5 C [99 F] and a chest radiological pneumonia pattern.

Management system for the building entrance:
- A liaison system was operated for Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building faculty, and entrants who have symptoms such as fever are to be reported voluntarily.
- Starting this afternoon (30 Oct 15), the KCDC Call Center (109) will carry out a monitoring system to check on individuals who have symptoms twice a day.
- However, for 500 people who take the SK Group employment exam on 25 Oct 15, a personal precaution guide will be given as a one-time exposure. A system for voluntary reporting (109 call center) for adverse symptoms will be in place.
- Konkuk University Animal Life Science Building (7-story building) is maintaining a state of disinfection and completely controlling access as preventative measures.
- According to the epidemiology investigation team, the suspected cases have been confirmed to have occurred intensively on the 5th floor laboratory.
- The building workers, entrants, laboratory workers, and the workers near the laboratory will be classified and examined in detail.
- KCDC are investigating and taking necessary steps to find the cause and manage the respiratory disease.
- KCDC will actively cooperate with relevant ministries and academic-medical specialists, and will plan to inform the public and the media often.

[The translations were requested of colleagues in Seoul by ProMED-mail consultant, Daniel Lucey, MD of Georgetown University and Jayoung Park. ProMED-mail would like to thank volunteer Korean subscribers for assisting with translations of the daily Korean MOH reports.

Currently, there are 34 cases, defined as people who visited Konkuk University Animal Life Sciences Building after 8 Oct 2015 and subsequently developed fever of 37.5 C [99 F] and a pneumonic pattern on chest radiograph. Clinically, they show fever, myalgias, and mild respiratory symptoms; none have a severe illness. In addition, there are 11 people who are currently staying at home awaiting results of chest radiography.

According to the 3rd item above, the epidemiologic investigation is focusing on the 5th floor laboratory of the Konkuk University Animal Life Science Building, where most cases were apparently exposed to the source. So far, no etiologic agent has been identified. We await further reports of the investigation.

Konkuk University is a private university located in Seoul and Chungju. Gyeonggi Province surrounds Seoul. Chungju is a city in North Chungcheong Province, which is south east of Seoul.
