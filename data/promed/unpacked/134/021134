Cholera outbreak in Nigeria kills 42 - hospital
-----------------------------------------------
A major outbreak of cholera in northern Nigeria has killed 42 people and
hospitalized hundreds in the last 2 weeks, authorities said on Wed, 16 Nov
2004. Gravely dehydrated people lined the floors of the Infectious Diseases
Hospital in Kano as the government told doctors to treat the victims free
of charge.
"We have had 629 cases so far in the last 2 weeks of which 42 are confirmed
dead," said Ashiru Rajab, the hospital's chief medical officer. More than
1600 Africans have been killed so far in 2004 by cholera, an intestinal
infection spread by contaminated food and water, WHO said.

Cholera reported in Kitgum
--------------------------
The suspected cholera outbreak which was reported recently has been
confirmed, the director of health services, Dr Vincent Oringa, has said. He
was addressing stakeholders and the cholera emergency committee on Fri 12
Nov 2004.
Oringa confirmed the existence of cholera in Akilok parish, in Orom
sub-county, a settlement camp with a population of 2442 people, comprising
77 households. It is located 56 miles north east of Kitgum.
Cholera had been suspected in the area after a number of bloody diarrhea
and other symptomatic dehydration cases were reported. 2 deaths and
specimens taken to Kampala for testing confirmed the disease. A cholera
Force Committee has been formed to contain the situation and control its
spread to other areas.

Cholera cases reach 56 in IDP camp
----------------------------------
The number of cholera cases reported among residents of Pabbo [internal]
displaced persons (IDP) camp in the northern Ugandan district of Gulu
reached 56, including 3 deaths in Oct 2004, WHO reported.
43 cholera patients had been treated at a health facility in the camp and
discharged by 28 Oct 2004 and 10 were still receiving treatment, the WHO
said in an update issued on 10 Nov 2004.
The 1st case of the epidemic was a man who has been in the camp without
visiting another place for a long time. He fell sick and was admitted in
Pabbo health center III with pneumonia on 3 Oct 2004 and he was about to be
discharged after improvement when he developed profuse diarrhea and
vomiting, and later died. The other 2 deaths occurred outside the
health-care settings.
Pabbo IDP camp is the largest and has a population of over 64 000 people.
The camps were set to accommodate people who could not continue to live in
their villages because of fighting between government forces and rebels of
the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). According to WHO, measures taken to curb
the spread of the disease include the setting up of a temporary cholera
treatment centre with isolation facilities, social mobilization of the
community towards containment of the epidemic through encouraging personal,
food and environmental hygiene using community resource persons, local FM
radio and community talks by the health workers and leaders.
Water chlorination began after tests found that all water pots in
households, 2 out of 14 boreholes and all 6 springs were contaminated. Oral
rehydration therapy sites were established in the camp to handle mild cases
of diarrhea and 2 large tents were set up to handle more cases, should the
need arise.
Cholera control measures were, however, being hampered by the recent heavy
rains that had worsened sanitary conditions, according to WHO. Supplies to
control the epidemic were still insufficient, the agency added.

Burundi: cholera hits IDPs after heavy rains
--------------------------------------------
3 people have died of cholera and 12 others are infected in a camp for
internally displaced persons (IDPs) following heavy rains in Burundi's
troubled western province of Bujumbura Rural, an official said on Mon, 15
Nov 2004. "2 other people are admitted to a health unit near the camp for
the displaced," Felix Ntahombaye, the administrator of Kabezi Commune, told
IRIN.The camp is in a communal centre in Kabezi, 20 km south of the
Burundian capital, Bujumbura.
Heavy rains during the last 3 weeks pounded the Kabezi camp, home to some
30 000 IDPs. The outbreak of cholera has been attributed to poor drainage
and sanitation in the camp.
Ntahombaye said cholera could also have broken out because of poor hygiene
and a shortage of clean water in the IDP site. He said the International
Rescue Committee had started to provide clean water to the IDPs in an
effort to curb the disease. The heavy rains have also destroyed the IDPs'
homes, most of which are wooden structures covered with banana leaves. Some
of the structures are now leaking and flooding the floors the IDPs sleep on.

3 people have died since mid October 2004 in Zingui (south), Cameroon, West
Africa, from a strange diarrhea, according to the independent daily
"Mutations" in its Wed 10 Nov 2004 edition. 10 similar cases are currently
under observation by the health services, according to the same source.
Symptoms are diarrhea and bloody vomit, swollen feet, edema, fatigue,
malaise, and hearing problems. The local people ascribe it to witchcraft or
Ebola and are treating it with tree bark [infusions], but health
authorities attribute it to amebic or bacterial dysentery caused by
drinking dirty water. [The clinical picture suggests shigellosis or
salmonellosis, or possibly campylobacter or yersinia infection. ï¿½ Mod.LJS]

Cholera outbreak seems to be slowing in Dakar
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of cholera in the West African state of Senegal appeared to be
slowing, health authorities said, with no cases of the waterborne illness
reported since 10 Nov 2004.
"The situation appears to be improving," said Doctor Bassirou Johnson of
the epidemiology division of the Senegalese health ministry. "We have seen
some suspect cases but they turned out to be false alarms."
6 people have died and 855 treated since mid-October 2004 for the
waterborne illness that spreads due to poor hygiene and sanitation.
The outbreak was 1st registered in one of the poorer neighborhoods in
Dakar, a cramped coastal town of dirty streets and limited fresh water
supplies.
The government has moved quickly to contain the outbreak, sending medicine
and equipment to even the most remote quarters to curb its transmission and
launching major disinfection campaigns in public markets and bus stations
and aboard the shared transport vehicles that ply the roads.
Cholera is a deadly but preventable disease that is generally contracted
from polluted water supplies and manifests itself in violent diarrhoea and
sometimes fatal dehydration.
This is the 1st cholera epidemic in Senegal since 1997. The last major
outbreak in the country was in 1995-97.

40 cholera cases confirmed in city
----------------------------------
As many as 40 patients admitted to Communicable Diseases Hospital (CDH) at
Tondiarpet have tested positive for cholera. Around 282 patients, mostly
from North Chennai, were admitted to the CDH in the past week with symptoms
of the disease.
While 32 more were admitted on Sun, 14 Nov 2004, on complaints of vomiting,
diarrhea and symptoms of dehydration, the Chennai Corporation said that the
number of suspected cholera cases reported at the hospital has decreased
considerably.
Some of the patients admitted 4 days ago were discharged on Sun, 14 Nov
2004, after treatment. Others are reported to be out of danger.
Local administration minister K P Anbazhagan along with Law Minister D
Jayakumar and Chennai Corporation deputy mayor "Karate" R Thiagarajan
visited the patients and asked the hospital authorities to take all
possible steps to prevent the disease from spreading further. Anbazhagan
instructed the Corporation officials to convene health camps in Tondiarpet
and Pulianthope zones, particularly in areas like Vysarpadi, Washermenpet
and Korukkupet, which are more affected.
According to officials, overflow of sewage, stagnation of sewage-mixed rain
water besides sewage water entering into drinking water pipes were the main
reasons for the outbreak.

[8] Diarrhea, fatal - Indonesia (Sumatra)

An outbreak of diarrhea has been plaguing Solok municipality, West Sumatra,
since last week, leaving at least 4 people dead and 217 others hospitalized
at one stage or another, local officials said on Tue, 16 Nov 2004.
Solok health office director Azwar Hijar said the victims had died in
separate hospitals, or before arriving at the hospital, from serious
dehydration after not seeking medical treatment in time.
The 4 dead victims were 2 adults aged 49 and 52 and 2 children aged 9 and
1.5 years. They died between 9 and 13 Nov 2004, when the diarrhea outbreak
was at its height.
Azwar said at least 217 other sufferers had been hospitalized in the Solok
General Hospital and the local military hospital, but most had been allowed
to return home. "There are currently only 30 diarrhea patients being
treated in the 2 hospitals. They were admitted on Sun, 14 Nov 2004," he added.
Azwar said the diarrhea outbreak was probably due to contaminated drinks or
food prepared using contaminated seaweed. According to Azwar, some of the
victims said that they had suffered cramps and started vomiting after
consuming beverages they had bought in Bareh traditional market in the city.
"We have yet to determine the type of bacteria. We have taken samples of
vomit and excrement from the patients for tests at the West Sumatra Health
Laboratory in Pangilun, Padang. It will take a week for the results," Azwar
added. He said most of the victims had probably been infected when they
took their relatives suffering from diarrhea to the hospital, or visited
them there.
"We suspect they picked up the bug from patients in the hospital as people
stopped consuming iced seaweed and drinks from Bareh market after 9 Nov
2004, the first day of the diarrhea outbreak," Azwar explained.
He said the Solok health office was opening a center that would be open
around the clock to handle the outbreak, adding that it would provide data,
information and guidance, as well as medicine, for local people.
Azwar said his office on Mon, 15 Nov 2004, had distributed around 800
bottles of rehydration fluid and 7000 tetracycline capsules, which had been
provided by the West Sumatra health office.

Friendly cholera found in resort
--------------------------------
A strain of cholera found in a resort was not deadly, health officials
said. On Thu 9 Nov 2004 an Australian tourist was admitted to hospital on
returning home from a holiday at the Plantation Island Resort in Aug 2004.
Health Ministry chief executive Lepani Waqatakirewa said there were 2 types
of bacteria which could cause cholera. "One is the harmful hemolytic strain
which causes cholera and the other is associated as a friendly bacteria and
is non-hemolytic," he said.
"Bacteria found on Plantation Island was non-hemolytic but health officials
responded to the threat by isolating the area and workers and gave guests
preventive measures."
Mr Waqatakirewa said cholera was mostly found in outer islands and the
Northern Division. "It is common where marine life is rich and fish is
taken from waters which are contaminated.
[The presence or absence of hemolysis in _V. cholerae_ does not necessarily
distinguish pathogenic strains of the organism from nonpathogenic ones. The
classical biotype of the cholera bacillus is nonhemolytic and certainly can
cause overt cholera. Hemolysis can be found in the El Tor biotype and,
historically, this has been used to distinguish the biotypes.
Strains of El Tor that do not produce hemolysis have been reported, and
some strains of both O1 and O139 _V. cholerae_ which are not hemolytic
initially can be hemolytic after serial passage through rabbit ideal loops.
The usefulness of hemolysis as a virulence factor is unclear, since
nonhemolytic strains produce fluid accumulation in the rabbit gut, and
hemolytic strains do not necessarily produce a secretory response.

cholerae O1, O139, non-O1, and non-O139 strains: clonal relationships
