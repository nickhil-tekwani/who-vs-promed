The source of malaria infection in Loudoun, Virginia
----------------------------------------------------
Some information on the geography and demography of the area may be of
interest to ProMED-mail readers. The location of the positive mosquito
pools was over 10 km from the residences of the 2 disease cases. The area
in question consists largely of upper middle case suburban single-family
housing. The area is becoming more ethnically diverse, with a large
immigrant population from El Salvador. My incidental observations indicate
that a number of Salvadorans work as gardeners/lawn care operators. Thus
the infections could possibly be based in cases of relapsing _P. vivax_
infection in the immigrant population, rather than an international
traveller arriving at nearby (10 km) Dulles International Airport.

[Stephen Guptill's observation supports our previous comment that there
must be an asymptomatic source of _P. vivax_ in the community, and a large
number of immigrants from a _P. vivax_-endemic country could be such a
source. The observation also underlines that it will be worth performing a
survey in this population looking for asymptomatic _P. vivax_ carriers who
should be treated to eliminate the source from which the mosquitoes get
their infection. - Mod.EP]
