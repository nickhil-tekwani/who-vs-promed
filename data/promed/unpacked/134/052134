Researchers in Germany yesterday [Mon 25 Jul 2015] reported finding more than 400 _Escherichia coli_ isolates from livestock and food products that tested positive for the _mcr-1_ gene, which can make bacteria resistant to the powerful antibiotic colistin.

Writing in PLoS One [1], the researchers reported that screening detected _mcr-1_ in 402 of 505 (79.8 percent) colistin-resistant _E. coli_ isolates derived from a German monitoring program on antibiotic resistance in zoonotic agents.

The researchers said the study, which screened more than 10 000 _E. coli_ isolates gathered from German livestock and food from 2010 to 2015, is the 1st systematic look at the prevalence of _mcr-1_ in the country. The overall _mcr-1_ detection rate was 3.8 percent.

The _mcr-1_ gene was first reported in November 2015 by an international team of researchers who found it in a strain of _E. coli_ identified in pigs, raw pork meat, and a handful of hospitalized patients in China. Since then, the gene has been detected in livestock, food, environmental, and human isolates in at least 30 countries.

Colistin is considered a last-resort antibiotic for bacterial infections that are resistant to other drugs. While bacteria can also become resistant to colistin through chromosomal mechanisms, _mcr-1_-mediated resistance is more worrisome because of the potential for rapid dissemination. The concern among public health officials is that the _mcr-1_ gene, which is located on a mobile piece of DNA called a plasmid and can spread quickly to other types of bacteria, will latch onto a highly drug-resistant bacteria and create a "superbug" that's nearly impossible to treat.

The authors of the study reported the _mcr-1_ gene was most prevalent in the poultry production and food chains, with 10.7 percent of turkey isolates and 5.6 percent of broiler isolates indicating the presence of the gene.

The presence of _mcr-1_ harboring _E. coli_ isolates was lower in veal calves (2.4 percent) and pigs (1.5 percent), and none were found in isolates from beef cattle or beef and dairy products. The authors noted that this finding was in contrast to China, where most _mcr-1_-positive _E. coli_ isolates were found in the pig production chain.

Overall, the authors said the prevalence of the _mcr-1_ gene in Germany is twice as high as in France and that colistin resistance in Germany is higher than the European average, which could be attributable to higher use of polymixin antibiotics (a class that includes colistin). But they urged more epidemiologic studies in other European countries in order to assess the German findings better.

The following is the abstract of the article referenced in the news report above:

"Since the 1st description of a plasmid-mediated colistin resistance gene (_mcr-1_) in November 2015 multiple reports of _mcr-1_ positive isolates indicate a worldwide spread of this newly discovered resistance gene in Enterobacteriaceae. Although the occurrence of _mcr-1_ positive isolates of livestock, food, environment and human origin is well documented only few systematic studies on the prevalence of _mcr-1_ are available yet. Here, comprehensive data on the prevalence of _mcr-1_ in German livestock and food isolates are presented. Over 10 600 _E. coli_ isolates from the national monitoring on zoonotic agents from the years 2010-2015 were screened for phenotypic colistin resistance (MIC value >2 mg/l). Of those, 505 resistant isolates were screened with a newly developed TaqMan-based real-time PCR for the presence of the _mcr-1_ gene. In total 402 isolates (79.8 percent of colistin resistant isolates) harboured the _mcr-1_ gene. The prevalence was depending on the food production chain. The highest prevalence was detected in the turkey food chain (10.7 percent), followed by broilers (5.6 percent). A low prevalence was determined in pigs, veal calves and laying hens. The _mcr-1_ was not detected in beef cattle, beef and dairy products in all years investigated. In conclusion, TaqMan based real-time PCR provides a fast and accurate tool for detection of _mcr-1_ gene. The overall detection rate of 3.8 percent for _mcr-1_ among all _E. coli_ isolates tested is due to high prevalence of _mcr-1_ in poultry production chains. More epidemiological studies of other European countries are urgently needed to assess German prevalence data."
