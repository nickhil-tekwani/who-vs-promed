In June 2002 the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
(DOHMH) initiated an investigation of reports of serious soft tissue
infections following injections for cosmetic purposes administered by
unlicensed medical practitioners. The DOHMH has since identified 14
confirmed and 11 suspected cases of soft tissue infections due to
_Mycobacterium abscessus_ that followed injections administered by
unlicensed medical practitioners. Most cases have been among women of
Hispanic ethnicity, ages 19 to 65 years, residing in NYC boroughs. Patients
reported having been injected between January and early May 2002 with
substances said to be silicone, vitamins, collagen, and hyaluronic acid
compounds in formulations not approved by the FDA.
All patients presented with skin/soft tissue infections of varying
severity; one patient's illness was complicated by mycobacteremia. Affected
sites have included buttocks, the face, breasts, neck, and hands. Some of
patients required hospital admission. No deaths have been reported, but
patients have required incision and drainage procedures with significant
scarring and disfigurement. Wound and skin cultures from all confirmed
cases have grown _M. abscessus_, and patients with suspected cases did not
have cultures done but presented with skin /soft tissue lesions at sites of
the injections that did not respond to short courses of oral antibiotics. 2
isolates that were tested for drug susceptibility were found to be
susceptible only to clarithromycin and amikacin.
Although 2 unlicensed providers who have been linked to some of the
patients were recently convicted, it is suspected that additional providers
continue to offer such injections. No new cases have been reported since
the first week of September 2002. However, the DOHMH urges all medical
providers to continue to look out for these infections in patients
presenting with the right constellation of clinical and epidemiological
features.
The New York City DOHMH continues to appreciate its ongoing partnership
with the medical and laboratory communities in helping us identify and
control outbreaks of infectious diseases that affect all residents of this
city. Providers should continue to report any unusual clustering of
clinical entities to DOHMH.

2002 Alert #14: Cluster of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infections following
injections for cosmetic purposes
----------------------------------------------------
Last week the New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) was notified of 4
cases of _Mycobacterium abscessus_ infections following injections for
cosmetic purposes administered by a person(s) in non-medical office
settings. All of the cases are in Hispanic/Latina females, ages ranging
from 31-65 years, residing in Manhattan or Queens. The patients report
having received injections of cosmetic substances (2 reported silicone, one
reported collagen, and one reported an unknown substance) between January
and May 2002. All of the patients presented with soft tissue infections (2
in the buttocks, 2 in the face) at 3 different hospitals (2 in Manhattan
and one in Queens). Preliminary analysis has identified _M. abscessus_ from
specimens from all of the patients. The NYCDOH is actively investigating to
determine the circumstances surrounding this outbreak.
_M. abscessus_ (formerly _M. chelonae_ subspecies _abscessus_) is an
acid-fast rod classified with _M. fortuitum_ and _M. chelonae_ as
pathogenic "rapid growing" nontuberculous mycobacteria (formerly
Mycobacteria Other Than Tuberculosis or MOTT). Although these organisms are
ubiquitous in the environment and have been found in municipal and well
water, soil, and dust, they rarely cause disease in humans. _M. abscessus_
has been associated with a variety of infections including skin and
soft-tissue infections (following puncture wounds or inoculations) (1),
pulmonary infection, infections related to foreign material (e.g., porcine
and prosthetic cardiac grafts, prosthetic joints, intravenous and dialysis
catheters, tympanoplasty tubes, and augmentation mammoplasty), and
postsurgical infections (2,3). In 1996, a cluster of _M. abscessus_
infection associated with intramuscular injections of adrenal cortex
extract was reported in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. In that
investigation, mycobacterium consistent with _M. abscessus_ was isolated
from bottles of the substance used for injection (4). Bacteremia and
disseminated infection, although rare, occur most commonly in
immunocompromised hosts and result in high proportions of deaths (5).
Diagnosis of _M. abscessus_ infection relies on culture and identification
of the organism. Rapidly growing mycobacteria grow well in broth (e.g.,
BACTEC 12B broth used in the BACTEC TB460 radiometric system) or on
agar-based media specific for the growth of mycobacteria (e.g., Middlebrook
7H10 or Lowenstein-Jensen agar) in 5-8 days (6). Isolates can be mistaken
for "diphtheroids" unless acid-fast staining or further identification is
performed (4). Species identification and susceptibility testing should be
conducted in a reference laboratory.
Treatment of _M. abscessus_ infection involves removal of infected tissue
or prosthetic material and antimicrobial therapy. Most isolates of _M.
abscessus_ are susceptible to clarithromycin, amikacin, imipenem, and
cefoxitan (1,6,7). Monotherapy may be considered for localized skin
infections (8), however, combination chemotherapy with at least 2
antimicrobial agents to which the isolate is susceptible is advised for
disseminated disease, because monotherapy has been shown to contribute to
the development of resistance (9). Localized disease typically responds to
6 months of therapy in immunocompetent hosts, and disseminated infections
can require >6 months of therapy (1,8).
