[The following comments have been received from Dr. Randall L. Crom (USDA,
APHIS, Veterinary Services, 4700 River Road, Unit 41, Riverdale, MD
20737-1231) in response to issues raised by Dr. Kellon. The posting has
been delayed by misdirection of mail. -Mod.CP
This is to provide some information on the West Nile virus (WNV) related
issues raised on ProMED-mail recently [West Nile virus, crow - USA (New
York) (04). The total number of birds positive this year for WNV is
available, by county, for 19 state and local jurisdictions currently
participating in the National West Nile Virus Surveillance System. Maps of
positive findings can be found on the World Wide Web at:
<http://nationalatlas.gov/virusmap.html>
As for the movement of horses from areas with known WNV infections in
equine, here is some background information. The Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) of USDA is responsible for oversight of
interstate and international movements of livestock, including horses. A
health certificate is required for any interstate or international
movement. Such a certificate would not be issued to a horse showing signs
of illness. Thus, horses with clinical WNV infection would not be allowed
to move interstate nor internationally. The decision not to impose
restrictions on the movement of horses that are not clinically ill was
based on an extensive review of the scientific literature on horses and
WNV. Your statement that "horses (and lemurs)... may play a significant
role in the epidemiology of West Nile virus infection" appears to be based
on a statement in a paper by Hubálek et al. published in the journal
"Emerging Infectious Diseases" in 1999. In that paper there is one
reference given for a similar statement on horses and lemurs. However, the
cited reference gives information only about lemurs, not about horses. Upon
our further inquiry, the author cited a reference text (Hannoun et al.,
1969) that states that one experimentally inoculated one-year old foal
developed sometimes high levels of circulating virus." The same text says
that an inoculated adult horse developed a "low viremia." No quantitative
details about the results or methods of the experiment were given.
All other evidence of which we are aware, including other peer-reviewed
papers (e.g., Schmidt et al., 1963) and reference texts (e.g., Anonymous,
1987; Hayes, 1989; Peiris et al., 1994), indicates that horses develop
relatively low viremias. Further, there is no epidemiological nor empirical
evidence of horses ever having been involved in the origin or propagation
of an epizootic of WNV. Based on this evidence it was concluded that horses
do not play a significant role in the epidemiology of WNV but at the most
are only incidental (dead-end) hosts. Further evidence that horses develop
relatively low viremias can be found in the results of yet unpublished WNV
studies, including an equine inoculation study conducted by USDA-APHIS in
late 1999. That study found a maximum WNV viremia in horses of 2.5 log 10
per ml of plasma. Such a viremia is considered to be below the level at
which a mosquito could acquire WNV from a horse. Further equine inoculation
and transmission studies are underway at Colorado State University (CSU),
primarily in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). Preliminary results of the first phase of that study are
consistent with the USDA study in terms of maximum viremias observed. In
the second phase of the CSU/CDC studies, virgin mosquitoes are being fed on
WNV-infected horses to see if they can become infected. Unless credible
evidence of transmission, or of a significant potential for transmission,
of WNV from horses to mosquitoes is found, restrictions on movements of
horses from WNV-affected areas will not be imposed by USDA-APHIS. Currently
there is no such evidence. There are also no areas in the United States in
which equine are currently known to be infected with WNV.
