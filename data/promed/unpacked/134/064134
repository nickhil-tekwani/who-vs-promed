Grain analyst Celeres/MPrado said its forecast for Brazil's record 2002/03
soy crop remained unchanged based on March field work, which showed output
losses due to rain and disease offsetting gains in other regions.
Brazil is expected to produce a record 50.9 million tonnes from the new
crop, up 19.6 percent from last year, Celeres/MPrado said in a monthly crop
output estimate published over the weekend.
The forecast is based on an area of 18.4 million hectares (45.5 million
acres) and an average yield of 2 768 kg per hectare, respectively 11.7
percent and 7.1 percent higher than last year.
Despite these gains, the reduction in productive potential in Mato Grosso
and Bahia of 263 000 and 31 000 tonnes, respectively, practically negated
the increase. According to the report, the reasons for the projected
reductions in these states were basically excess rains in Mato Grosso and
the occurrence of Asian rust in both Bahia and Mato Grosso.
If rains continue in the center-west, said Celeres/MPrado, greater losses
could be registered in Mato Grosso.

[This is the second report of soybean rust in Brazil in the current crop
year. The disease is caused by _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_, a major pathogen of
soybean. It is present in tropical areas in the Eastern and Western
Hemispheres, where it can cause severe crop losses (10-100 percent). Of
concern to soybean producers in North America is dispersal of rust spores
by winds from South America to soybean production areas in the United
States and possibly Canada. Of the reported outbreaks, the majority occur
in Africa (Nigeria, Uganda, and Zimbabwe). - Mod.DH]
