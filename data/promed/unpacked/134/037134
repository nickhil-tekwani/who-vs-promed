Arusha Congress To Discuss Emerging Health Diseases, October 8, 1997
DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (PANA) - Emerging health diseases will be the main
focus of the eighth International Congress of the World Federation of
Public Associations which opens Sunday in Arusha, Northern Tanzania.
The chairman of the meeting's organising committee, Wenceslaus Kilama, said
the emerging public health problems had been mainly caused by rapid
urbanisation.
These problems include cancer, cardiovascular diseases, sexually
transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, stroke, drug abuse, alcoholism, respiratory
diseases and violence.
He told a pre-congress news conference in Dar Es Salaam that the meeting,
being held in Africa for the first time, was expected to attract some 800
health and medical specialists and policy-makers.
The last congress of the Washington-based body was held in 1994 in Bali,
Indonesia.
Meanwhile, the Medical Association of Tanzania has asked the Ministry of
Health to issue special identity cards to doctors to check masqueraders.
The association's members noted during the recent annual meeting in Dar Es
Salaam that cases of impersonation were rampant in the country.
"The word 'doctor' is losing credibility these days," one member told his
colleagues. We now hear of traditional healers calling themselves doctors
or professors.
