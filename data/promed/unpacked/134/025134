[Moldova reported ASF [African swine fever] for the first time on 17 Sep 2016. Two outbreaks were detected during that event, which was declared resolved. See final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000021708_20161129_141330.pdf.

Since this new outbreak is located close to the border with Ukraine, (as is noted in the epidemiological comments), it should not be unexpected that ASF is again newly reported in Moldova.
