After 10 years with no detected wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission in
Namibia, an outbreak of poliomyelitis cases occurred in 2006. The
outbreak was traced to importation from neighboring Angola of WPV
type 1 (WPV1) that originated in India. As of 2 Oct 2006, a total of
19 cases of polio, with paralysis onset between early May and 26 Jun
[2006], had been confirmed by isolation of WPV1 from stool specimens,
primarily from young adult males; 6 of the patients died. This report
describes outbreak investigation and response activities and provides
an update on routine and supplemental immunization activities (SIAs)*
and acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance in Namibia.
Outbreak Investigation and Response
---------------------
On 8 May 2006, a man aged 39 years from the Hardap region,
approximately 400 km southeast of the capital city of Windhoek, was
admitted to a Windhoek hospital after onset of AFP 2 days earlier. On
5 Jun [2006], the Regional Reference Poliovirus Laboratory at the
National Institute of Communicable Diseases in South Africa reported
isolation of WPV1 in the patient's stool specimens. AFP surveillance
was intensified, and as of 2 Oct 2006, a total of 306 AFP cases had
been reported for the year [see Figure 1- Acute flaccid paralysis
(AFP) cases (N=306), by week of onset -- Namibia, 1 Jan - 2 Oct 2006,
at URL link provided above - Mod.MPP].
Of the 306 AFP cases, 19 cases were confirmed as polio through WPV1
isolation, with the most recent onset of paralysis occurring on 26
Jun [2006]. Of the other 287 AFP cases, 201 were classified as
nonpolio AFP, and the National Polio Expert Committee classified 7
cases as polio compatible. Another 66 AFP cases, with inadequate**
stool specimens, all virus-negative, are pending classification,
including some that subsequently might be classified as polio
compatible; 13 additional cases are pending laboratory results and
subsequent classification. In addition to the single case reported
from the Hardap region, WPV-confirmed cases were reported from 2
densely populated areas: 1) informal settlements (i.e., areas with
temporary substandard housing, poor sanitation, and crowding) in the
Katutura vicinity of Windhoek in the Khomas region (14 WPV cases),
and 2) three adjacent regions bordering Angola: Ohangwena and
Omusati, with one case each, and Oshana, with 2 cases [see Figure 2 -
Wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and polio-compatible cases --
Namibia, 1 May - 2 Oct 2006, at URL link provided above - Mod.MPP].
Compared with patients with nonpolio AFP, the WPV patients more often
reported having contact with persons from Angola during the 3 months
preceding paralysis onset (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.007). All
WPV-confirmed cases occurred in persons aged greater than 14 years
(range: 14-51 years), with 14 (74 percent) of 19 confirmed cases in
persons aged 15-29 years. Seventeen (89 percent) of the 19 patients
were male. Six patients with confirmed WPV died (case-fatality ratio
[CFR]: 32 percent); 4 of the 6 who died had respiratory symptoms
requiring ventilator support, and at least one other patient
developed respiratory difficulty shortly before death.
In response to the outbreak of WPV cases, the Namibia Ministry of
Health and Social Services (MoHSS) activated the National Health
Emergency Management Committee to coordinate activities. Three
nationwide SIAs were held during 21-23 Jun [2006], 18-20 Jul [2006],
and 22-24 Aug 2006, using both house-to-house and fixed-post vaccine
delivery strategies. Because most patients were adults, the first 2
SIAs targeted the entire population of Namibia (i.e., adults and
children of all ages); the 3rd round targeted only children aged less
than 5 years. Monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine type 1 (mOPV1) was
administered during the first 2 SIAs; trivalent OPV (tOPV) was
administered during the 3rd SIA, along with measles vaccine and
distribution of vitamin A supplements.
Based on the number of vaccine doses administered and current
population estimates, close to 100 percent of the target populations
were reached during all 3 SIAs. Postcampaign monitoring conducted in
9 of the 13 regions determined vaccination coverage of greater than
95 percent. The 2nd and 3rd SIAs were conducted after onset of the
last reported confirmed case of polio, which occurred on 26 Jun
[2006], 5 days after the 1st nationwide SIA [see Figure 1 - Acute
flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases (N=306), by week of onset -- Namibia, 1
Jan - 2 Oct 2006, at URL link provided above - Mod.MPP].
Previous Outbreaks in Namibia
--------------
Namibia reported no polio cases from 1990 until May 1993, when an
outbreak of 53 WPV1 cases (27 virologically confirmed and 26
clinically compatible) occurred. Seventy-nine percent of patients in
the 1993 outbreak were aged less than 5 years. A smaller WPV1
outbreak with 27 cases occurred in the northern regions of Namibia
during 1994-1995 (1). Both outbreaks were linked by genetic
sequencing to WPV imported from Angola. The most recent reported WPV
case before 2006 occurred in September 1995.
Immunization Activities
------------
The Namibian Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) was established
in June 1990, the year Namibia gained independence from South Africa.
Public health services, including immunization, had been severely
disrupted by conflict during 1966-1989. Immunization services
improved after 1990, with survey estimates for infant coverage with 3
doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV3), increasing from 37 percent
in 1989 to 76 percent in 2000 (Table). However, during 1989-2000,
coverage estimates varied among regions (2,7,8); for example, OPV3
coverage varied by region from 48 percent to 78 percent in 1992 (7).
Since 2000, annual national estimates of coverage with OPV3 have
ranged from 64 percent to 83 percent [See Table - Estimated
vaccination coverage with 3 doses of live, attenuated oral poliovirus
vaccine among children aged less than or equal to 12 months, by
source of estimate -- Namibia 1989-2006, at URL link provided above -
Mod.MPP], with continued variation among regions. OPV3 coverage
exceeded 80 percent in 20 (61 percent) of 33 districts in 2004 and 10
(30 percent) of 33 districts in 2005. In addition to routine
immunization, annual SIAs have been held since 1996, targeting
children aged less than 5 years.
AFP Surveillance
----------
Although most AFP cases are nonpolio (i.e., resulting from causes
other than poliomyelitis), meeting goals for AFP surveillance helps
to ensure that the surveillance system is sensitive enough to detect
poliomyelitis cases should they occur. AFP surveillance is evaluated
by 2 key indicators: sensitivity of reporting (target: nonpolio AFP
rate of greater than 1.0 case per 100 000 children aged less than 15
years***) and completeness of specimen collection (target: 2 adequate
stool specimens collected from greater than 80 percent of all AFP
cases). During 2001--2005, national nonpolio AFP rates in Namibia
exceeded greater than 1.0 case per 100 000 persons aged less than 15
years (2.6 in 2004 and 2.0 in 2005). With the increase in AFP
reporting during the outbreak, AFP rates in 2006 have exceeded 2.0
cases in all regions. Nationally, adequate stool specimens were
obtained from greater than 80 percent of persons with AFP during
2003-2005. However, adequate stool collection during 1 Jan-2 Oct
2006, was 67 percent, and exceeded 80 percent in only 4 of Namibia's
13 regions.
Genetic sequencing determined that the WPV1 in the Namibia outbreak
belongs to the same cluster as the virus detected in 2005 in both
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which had been imported
into Angola from India. Sequencing indicated that this outbreak virus
had been circulating for up to 2 years in the southwest subregion of
Africa before detection in 2005. Consistent with recent undetected
circulation and ongoing surveillance gaps, Angola reported 10 WPV1
cases in 2005 but none in 2006 until reporting a case with onset 27
Jun 2006. The genetic sequence relationships among the Namibian
isolates indicate that spread of the virus occurred from a
single-source importation.

MMWR Editorial Note:
This 2006 outbreak underscores the ongoing threat of WPV importations
into polio-free areas, the ability of WPV to spread to susceptible
populations of any age, and the need for polio-free countries to
maintain high levels of preparedness for the timely detection of and
response to importations. In this outbreak, virus importation from
Angola was indicated by sequencing data, the frequency of
cross-border contacts between population groups from Namibia and
Angola, and the higher frequency of contact with Angolan residents by
patients with confirmed WPV infection compared with patients with
nonpolio AFP.
The Namibia outbreak illustrates that populations of any age with low
immunity against poliovirus are at risk. This outbreak primarily
affected young adults born before 1990, an age group consisting of
persons who either had not been vaccinated for polio or had been
vaccinated incompletely. For the most part, this group also would not
have been covered by EPI SIAs conducted 4 times a year during
1990-1995 and targeted to children aged less than 5 years. Increasing
vaccination coverage among children aged less than 5 years in the
early 1990s would have reduced transmission of WPV, decreasing
opportunities for older, unvaccinated persons to acquire natural
immunity, a factor possibly contributing to the high attack rate in
older age groups. Previous polio outbreaks among adults included a
large outbreak (138 paralytic cases, 69 confirmed WPV1 cases) in
Albania in 1996, with an attack rate of 10 per 100 000 persons among
adults aged 19-25 years who had been vaccinated with OPV that might
have been stored without refrigeration for prolonged periods (3).
Outbreaks affecting adults also have occurred among religious groups
with low vaccination acceptance (4).
The CFR was 32 percent in this outbreak involving young adults. High
CFRs in young adults during polio outbreaks have been reported
previously. In an outbreak in Cape Verde in 2000, the CFR was 57
percent among persons aged greater than 15 years (5). In the 1996
outbreak in Albania, the CFR was highest (18 percent) among persons
aged 19-25 years (3). In the 2006 outbreak in Namibia, at least 5 of
the 6 patients who died had respiratory symptoms, and 4 required
ventilator support, suggesting that bulbar paralysis might have
contributed to the high CFR.
During 2004 and 2005, AFP surveillance systems in Namibia and Angola,
at the national level, surpassed the key indicators for sensitivity
of reporting and completeness of specimen collection. However, WPV
circulation in the southwest African subregion escaped detection for
approximately 2 years, suggesting considerable AFP surveillance
quality gaps at the subnational level. During the 2006 outbreak, only
4 of Namibia's 13 regions have met the 80 percent stool adequacy
standard. Surveillance training targeting district and regional MoHSS
staff members was held in July, August, and September 2006.
Maintaining sensitive surveillance and stool adequacy levels in
Namibia and surrounding countries is critical to rapid detection of
WPV virus circulation.
WHO's Advisory Committee on Polio Eradication recommends that any
polio-free country that detects imported WPV conduct at least 3
large-scale, house-to-house SIAs using type-specific mOPV, initiating
the first within 28 days of confirmation, and continuing with at
least 2 additional SIAs after the last virus is detected (6). Namibia
followed these recommendations, conducting the first SIA round, which
targeted the entire population, within 3 weeks of laboratory
confirmation of the first WPV-confirmed case and 46 days after the
1st onset of paralysis. The last known WPV-confirmed case occurred
less than a week after the first SIA, with no WPV-confirmed cases
reported since then, although the 66 cases with inadequate stool
specimen collection pending review and classification by the National
Polio Expert Committee are of concern. Additional SIA rounds in
Namibia will be necessary if more WPV cases are detected.
The risk for continuing WPV spread from Angola south to Namibia or
north to the Democratic Republic of Congo remains high until
circulation in Angola is interrupted. SIAs in Angola are planned for
16-18 Nov 2006. The increase in the number of WPV cases reported from
endemic countries (particularly Nigeria and India) in 2006
underscores the continuing threat of importations from polio-endemic
countries and the necessity for full implementation of outbreak
response recommendations (6) by all polio-free countries until
poliovirus transmission is interrupted globally.

[The above article, published simultaneously in the MMWR and the WHO
WER, is an excellent review of the outbreak and issues related to the
outbreak and polio eradication in general.
One obvious concern is that there is laboratory evidence of 2 years
of undetected circulation of wild poliovirus (WPV) in the affected
region in Africa. One wonders if there are other neighboring
countries with significant communication with Angola (the presumed
direct source of importation) where the WPV has been circulating
since the original outbreak in Angola and is as yet undetected.
This does give one food for thought in assessing the current criteria
established for certification of polio-free status. The current
criteria include confirmation that there has not been WPV circulation
in the country for 3 years. Remembering that the paralytic to
non-paralytic ratio of poliovirus infection ranges from a high of
1:50 to a low of 1:1000 and a stated average of 1:200 (there is one
paralytic case for every 200 individuals infected with the wild
poliovirus). In Namibia alone, with 306 reported cases of polio in
the above reported outbreak, one can estimate there were
approximately 61 200 individuals infected with WPV during the
outbreak (the estimate ranges from 15 300 to 306 000 infected
individuals).
Playing with simple projections, if one assumes that each infected
individual excretes the WPV for an average of 3 weeks (see ref. 2
below), and each infected individual encounters at least one
susceptible individual during the 3 weeks of WPV shedding, then
during the course of a year, the lowest number of infections related
to that one WPV infected individual would be approximately 17
individuals... even if the paralytic to non-paralytic rate was a high
of 1:50, it could conceivably take 2.9 years before a single
paralytic polio case occurs. But if each person encounters and
infects at least 2 individuals, then approximately 262 144
individuals will be infected during the course of one year, and
between 262 and 5243 paralytic cases will occur (an expected average
of 1311 paralytic cases). The 1st scenario, though preferable from a
morbidity and mortality impact might well lead to a situation where
WPV can circulate for a significant time before it is detected.
