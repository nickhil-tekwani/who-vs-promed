The Mississippi Department of Health has reported 2 new human cases
of West Nile virus infection, one in Rankin County and one in Pike
County. That brings the state's total West Nile virus human case
total [for 2006] to 183, with 13 resulting in death, officials said
Friday [22 Dec 2006].
This time last year [2005], Mississippi health officials reported 70
human cases with 6 deaths.
State Health Officer Brian Amy said West Nile is a year-round virus.
"Although West Nile virus is most prevalent in late to mid-summer, it
can occur throughout the year," Amy said in a statement.
Health officials also reported one case of Jamestown Canyon virus in
Walthall County. It is a mosquito borne virus that generally causes a
mild illness and rarely meningitis or encephalitis. It is seen
generally in adults.
About 80 percent of people who are infected with the West Nile virus
will have no symptoms, health officials said. The remaining 20
percent may experience a range of flu-like symptoms. Symptoms of
West Nile virus infection are often mild or flu-like and may include
fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, a rash, muscle weakness or swollen
lymph nodes. In a small number of people, infection can result in
encephalitis or meningitis, which can lead to paralysis, coma and
possibly death.

[The report from Mississippi is interesting in that it documents West
Nile virus cases continuing to occur after the onset of cold weather
has halted transmission in northern states. - Mod.TY]
