A 65 year old woman from Zhanybek region of West Kazakhstan oblast has been hospitalised with anthrax, Tengri News reports, citing the Moi Gorod regional news website. The woman was delivered to the Regional Infectious Diseases Hospital on 13 Oct 2014.

She started getting the 1st symptoms on 9 Oct 2014, but no one was quarantined in relation to the case because by the time the anthrax diagnosis was confirmed by a lab, the incubation period had already run out with no more cases being reported. Two people who came in contact with the woman are being closely watched by doctors, however.

The 65 year old woman is believed to have gotten the rare infectious disease from a sheep she reportedly butchered all by herself on 30 Sep 2014. Sores started appearing on her nose on 9 Oct 2014.

"On 13 Oct 2014, a medical team went to the district to find the source of the disease. There is no rush, since the anthrax incubation period is 5 to 9 days - that is, this period has already passed, and there have been no other [human] cases reported. But finding the cause of the disease [is] a completely different thing. Domestic animals have been vaccinated in the area. The sick animal's skin has been sent (to a lab) for tests, but there was no meat left, unfortunately," head of the Consumer Protection Department of West Kazakhstan Oblast Sergei Scherbin said. The fact that the meat was eaten, or sold and eaten, is not a good sign, since it can also become a source of the disease. But doctors are monitoring the area for more [human] cases.

The woman is getting better. Animals in the area were treated to prevent more cases of anthrax [I suspect the reporter means vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ].

In recent years, there have been other isolated cases of anthrax in Western Kazakhstan: in Burlin, Zhanibek, Syrym, and Zelenovsk regions. In all these cases, slaughtered cattle were the source of the disease for people.

Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects both humans and other animals. Effective vaccines against anthrax are now available, and some forms of the disease respond well to antibiotic treatment. Anthrax does not spread directly from one infected animal or person to another; it is spread by spores. Anthrax commonly infects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals that ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Diseased animals can spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact (for example, inoculation of infected blood to broken skin) or by consumption of a diseased animal's flesh. The disease is primarily countered by vaccination of animals.

[Anthrax is most commonly reported from the western and eastern oblasts, but especially in the east and along the south east Kyrgyz border. For a map of Kazakhstan, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kazakhstan_physio-2001.jpg.

In the past few years, human cases were reported in 2008 (10 cases, 2 deaths), 2009 (7), 2010 (12), 2011 (6), and zero in 2013; there are no data for 2012. While single bovine cases were reported in 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012, all were in eastern Kazakhstan, and reports of ovine outbreaks are absent since 2006. In spite of the absence of livestock reports, it is an enzootic threat, and the sporadic nature of the outbreaks reflects the high level of livestock vaccination each year. It is probably best described as the Kazakh version of what we experience in the eastern Dakotas, where the authorities work each spring to get their ranchers to vaccinate their cattle. Most comply and when outbreaks occur it is among the procrastinators' cattle, because they are at risk, not among the protected vaccinated stock. We see the same scenario in Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. It is interesting that this Kazakh report emphasizes the public health response and, in passing, the veterinary response to get the village livestock vaccinated.

...which come together to show that the genomic differences reflect spore adaptation to survival in different soils. - Mod.MHJ
