At least 50 people including kids have fallen ill after inhaling poisonous chlorine gas which leaked from a drum inside a factory in Howrah's [West Bengal] Ghushuri on Monday morning [5 Feb 2018]. The incident took place near Jagannath ghat in Belur sparked panic among locals. People felt a burning sensation in their eyes following the leakage. Some of the nearby schools were shut down due to the incident. After being informed, fire brigade personnel rushed to the spot and threw the packed container into the West Bengal River Hooghly.

The river water turned yellow due to chemical reaction, posing a serious threat to the plants and animals underwater.

Those who were injured were immediately taken to TL Jaiswal Hospital in Howrah. Most of the victims had complained about a burning sensation in their eyes and respiratory distress. While most of the patients are now stated to be in stable condition, some were vomiting. Some of the locals around Jagannath ghat became agitated and prevented the fire brigade to bury the container near the bank.

Having found no option, the fire brigade personnel finally threw the container into the river polluting the water. When the factory officials found the drum to be leaking they immediately informed the matter to the fire brigade and police who rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control. Police helped the fire brigade personnel to take the drum to Jagannath ghat for defusing the gas.

They used microphones to alert locals living around Jagannath ghat to go away from the river bank as the container was thrown into the river. Locals, however, alleged fire personnel reached the spot late. According to police, the leakage took place at around 9 am on [Mon 5 Feb 2018]. The fire brigade officials initially tried to identify the leakage. After identifying the leakage, they started repairing it. Soaps were applied to repair the leakage. Locals were asked by the fire officials not to light matches to avert any major tragedy.

[Chlorine gas is a respiratory irritant, but in high enough concentrations pulmonary edema may develop. Chlorine gas may also cause headaches, nausea, vomiting.

Exposure to low levels of chlorine gas for extended periods (chronic exposure) may produce pulmonary problems such as a chronic cough, phlegm production, wheezing, and possibly asthma or asthma like conditions, and eye irritation.

Humans can usually detect chlorine gas or smells at levels below 1 part per million (ppm). Mucus membrane irritation occurs above 1 ppm, but increases in intensity up to about 15 ppm. Chest pain and shortness of breath usually occur at 30 ppm but at 40-60 ppm are levels where pulmonary edema may develop.

There is no specific treatment for those who are ill but to flush the eyes and maybe the nose, and provide clean air. Treatment is symptomatic. Washing the body and all affected areas of the body will help eliminate the chlorine on the skin and reduce the pain.

Chlorine gas in high levels is painful to the eyes and the respiratory system, and people exposed to very high levels can die.

Chlorine gas is usually a yellow-greenish and is heavier than air, so it remains near the ground. Furthermore, the color described when the barrel was placed in the water is consistent with the color of chlorine.

Large amounts of chlorine in the water may produce chlorine salts and other chemicals when combined with substances in the water. Based upon the description this may be a significant environmental contamination. - Mod.TG
