Battling the Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in West Africa
--------------------------------------------------------
As the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak continues to spread, with 1093 cases and 660 deaths [now 1201 cases and 672 deaths as of 23 Jul 2014 -- see WHO update in ProMED-mail archive 20140727.2638658] reported across west Africa, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is stepping up its response in the most affected areas. While the number of cases in Guinea has declined significantly, in neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia more and more people are being infected with the virus. With resources already stretched, health authorities and international organizations are struggling to bring the outbreak under control.

Sierra Leone
------------
In Sierra Leone -- now the epicenter of the epidemic, with 454 cases recorded so far [now 525 cases and 224 deaths as of 23 Jul 2014 -- see WHO update in ProMED-mail archive 20140727.2638658] -- MSF is rapidly scaling up its response, with 22 international and 250 Sierra Leonean staff currently working in the country. In Kailahun, in the east of the country, the team is running a 64-bed EVD treatment center. Since the facility opened on 24 Jun 2014, 131 suspected, probable, and confirmed patients have been admitted for treatment. So far, 12 patients have recovered and returned home to their families. An MSF psychologist is providing support and counseling to patients and their families, as well as to other MSF staff members.

MSF is also supporting the Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS) at 2 referral sites in the villages of Koindu and Buedu in Kailahun district, where people with symptoms of EVD are isolated before being transferred by ambulance to MSF's center in town. In the past 3 weeks, MSF has trained more than 200 community health workers to deliver essential health messages to people in their villages about how to protect themselves against EVD and what action to take if someone shows any signs or symptoms of the disease.

MSF will now focus its efforts on halting the spread of the disease in the area straddling the Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia borders, where the population is very mobile and people continue to transmit the disease to different villages. The team will scale up its health promotion and outreach activities in the villages in this area, and reinforce the alert system so that any new suspected cases can be identified promptly and transferred in MSF's ambulance to Kailahun for treatment.

[In Sierra Leone, the doctor who led the fight against EVD, Sheik Umar Khan, has died of the disease. Government officials hailed Dr Khan, 39, as a "national hero". The government disclosed last week [22 Jul 2014] that he was being treated for Ebola and had been quarantined (http://frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/news/2492-roberts-intl-airport-puts-ebola-preventive-measures-in-place). - Mod.JW]

Guinea
------
In Guinea, the situation has stabilized in some areas and MSF has closed its EVD treatment center in Telimele, in the west of the country, after no new cases were reported for 21 days. During 7 weeks, 21 people with the disease were admitted to the center, with an astonishing 75 percent of patients making a recovery. Without medical care, as few as 10 percent of patients could be expected to survive.

In the capital, Conakry, MSF is reducing its activities as far fewer cases are appearing. Currently the Donka treatment center has just one patient who is now recovering and should be able to leave the hospital by next week. MSF is planning to hand over responsibility for the center to the Guinean Ministry of Health by the end of July [2014]. Of the 59 confirmed EVD patients admitted to the center since 25 Mar 2014, 63 percent recovered and were able to return home. However, cured patients continue to face stigma from their communities and even some of MSF's Guinean staff prefer not to reveal where they are working, for fear of being ostracized by their families.

In Gueckedou, in the southeast -- the original epicenter of the epidemic -- the number of patients in MSF's center has declined significantly, with currently just 2 patients admitted. It is very unlikely, however, that this reflects an end to the outbreak; instead it suggests that infected people may be hiding in their communities rather than coming for treatment. There continues to be significant fear surrounding EVD amongst local communities and MSF teams have been prevented from visiting 4 villages due to hostility. MSF is working with local authorities and elders to try to ensure safe access to these areas in order to obtain a clearer picture of whether people are still being infected and dying of the virus. Since the beginning of the outbreak, MSF has treated 150 patients in its center in Gueckedou. The recovery rate in the Gueckedou centre has been lower than in Telimele or Conakry, as people have been delaying coming for treatment.

Liberia
-------
In Liberia, the situation is deteriorating rapidly, with cases of EVD now confirmed in 7 counties, including in the capital, Monrovia. There are critical gaps in all aspects of the response, and urgent efforts are needed to scale up, particularly in terms of contact tracing, organizing safe burials, and establishing a functioning alert system. Already stretched beyond capacity in Guinea and Sierra Leone, MSF is able to provide only limited technical support to the Liberian Ministry of Health. MSF has set up an EVD treatment center in Foya, in Lofa county in northern Liberia, where cases have been increasing since the end of May [2014]. After the initial set up, MSF handed over the management of the center to nongovernmental organization Samaritan's Purse on 8 Jul 2014.

There are currently 6 patients admitted to the center and MSF experts continue to provide technical support and training to the staff there. The team will now shift its efforts to Voinjama, also in Lofa county, where there are reports of people dying of EVD in their villages before being able to reach medical assistance. The MSF team will set up a referral unit for the Ministry of Health so that people suspected to have EVD can be isolated and then transferred to the treatment center in Foya.

In Monrovia, an MSF emergency team -- comprising an emergency coordinator, medical coordinator, one doctor, 2 epidemiologists, and 2 water and sanitation specialists -- is constructing a new tented treatment center with capacity for 40-60 beds. It was scheduled to open on 27 Jul 2014 and will also be run by Samaritan's Purse. Previously, the MSF team had already set up and handed over to the Ministry a 15 bed treatment unit at Monrovia's JFK hospital Health in April 2014. However, the unit has since been closed and all patients are currently cared for at ELWA [Eternal Love Winning Africa] hospital in Paynesville until the new center is open at the same site. Currently there are 14 patients admitted to this center. The MSF team is also supporting the Ministry of Health in the overall coordination of the EVD response and providing technical and medical guidance.

[Excerpts]
Lagos hospital shut down
------------------------
As part of measures to prevent the spread of Ebola virus disease (EVD), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Federal Government have shut down the hospital, First Consultants Medical Centre Limited, Ikoyi Road, Obalende, Lagos, where the 1st victim died.

They have also begun testing of all passengers on the same flight with the 1st EVD virus victim in Nigeria who died on Friday [25 Jul 2014] in a Lagos hospital. It is feared that all the more than 200 passengers on board were exposed to the deadly virus and may continue to spread the disease if they are not quarantined.

[3] Nigeria, Liberia: precautions
Date: Tue 29 Jul 2014
Source: BBC News [edited]
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-28550906


A major West African airline has stopped flying to Liberia and Sierra Leone amid growing concern about the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. Asky said it took the decision to keep "its passengers and staff safe during this unsettling time". The number of people killed by the virus in West Africa has now reached 672, according to new UN figures. Asky is the 2nd airline, after Nigeria's largest airline, Arik Air, to ban flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone. It had not halted flights to Guinea, but passengers departing from there would be "screened for signs of the virus", Asky said.

Last week, Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, reported its 1st case -- that of Liberian finance ministry official Patrick Sawyer who flew to the main city, Lagos, in an Asky flight.

Liberia has deployed police officers at the international airport in the capital, Monrovia, to ensure passengers are screened for symptoms of Ebola. "So if you have a flight and you are not complying with the rules, we will not allow you to board."

Liberia has also suspended all football activities in an effort to control the spread of Ebola. "Football being a contact sport -- people are sweating -- they do contact each other, and that could result in contracting the disease," the president of its football association, Musa Hassan Bility, told the BBC. "It also has to do with the fans because whenever there is a game, a lot of people come together and we want to discourage gathering at this point," he said. [This is overabundance of caution: people who are infectious have nasty symptoms and don't feel like playing football or going to a game. - Mod.JW]

The BBC's Jonathan Paye Layleh in Monrovia says that public awareness campaigns around Ebola have been stepped up in the city. Many people are worried about the outbreak, and fewer people are going to restaurants and entertainment centres, he says.

[4] Liberia

No one knows for sure just how many people Patrick Sawyer came into contact with the day he boarded a flight in Liberia, had a stopover in Ghana, changed planes in Togo, and then arrived in Nigeria, where authorities say he died days later from Ebola virus disease [EVD]. Now health workers are scrambling to trace those who may have been exposed to Sawyer across West Africa, including flight attendants and fellow passengers.

Health experts say it is unlikely he could have infected others with the virus. Still, unsettling questions remain: How could a man whose sister recently died from EVD manage to board a plane leaving the country? [Is it proposed that all passengers be asked if they had a recent death in the family? And supposing they had, do the authorities expect a straight answer if the result is that the passenger is denied boarding? - Mod.JW]

Worse: Could EVD become the latest disease to be spread by international air travel? Sawyer's death on Friday [25 Jul 2014] has led to tighter screening of airline passengers in West Africa, where an unprecedented outbreak that emerged in March [2014] has killed more than 670 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. But some health authorities expressed little confidence in such precautions. "The best thing would be if people did not travel when they were sick, but the problem is people won't say when they're sick. They will lie in order to travel, so it is doubtful travel recommendations would have a big impact," said Dr. David Heymann, professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "The important thing is for countries to be prepared when they get patients infected with EVD, that they are isolated, family members are told what to do and health workers take the right steps."

[It was reported that the victim had no symptoms when he boarded in Liberia -- see Ebola virus disease - West Africa (101): Nigeria ex Liberia, WHO, Sierra Leone 20140726.2636095. - Mod.JW]

The World Health Organization is awaiting laboratory confirmation after Nigerian health authorities said Sawyer tested positive for ebolavirus, WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said. [Confirmation came from a competent Nigerian lab. - Mod.JW]

The WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions since the outbreak came to light. "We would have to consider any travel recommendations very carefully, but the best way to stop this outbreak is to put the necessary measures in place at the source of infection," Hartl said. Closing borders "might help, but it won't be exhaustive or foolproof."

The risk of travelers contracting EVD is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva, experts say. EVD can't be spread like flu through casual contact or breathing in the same air. Patients are contagious only once the disease has progressed to the point they show symptoms, according to the WHO. The most vulnerable are health care workers and relatives who come in much closer contact with the sick.

Still, witnesses say Sawyer, a 40-year-old Finance Ministry employee en route to a conference in Nigeria, was vomiting and had diarrhea aboard at least one of his flights with some 50 other passengers aboard. Ebolavirus can be contracted from traces of feces or vomit, experts say. Sawyer was immediately quarantined upon arrival in Lagos -- a city of 21 million people -- and Nigerian authorities say his fellow travelers were advised of EVD's symptoms and then were allowed to leave. The incubation period can be as long as 21 days, meaning anyone infected may not fall ill for several weeks. Health officials rely on "contact tracing" -- locating anyone who may have been exposed, and then anyone who may have come into contact with that person. That may prove impossible, given that other passengers journeyed on to dozens of other cities.

International travel has made the spread of disease via airplanes almost routine. Outbreaks of measles, polio and cholera have been traced back to countries thousands of miles away. Even EVD previously traveled the globe this way: During an outbreak in Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire] in the 1990s, the virus infected a veterinarian [who had examined dead chimpanzees in the forest and] who traveled to Switzerland, where the disease was snuffed out upon arrival and she ultimately survived, experts say. Now 2 American aid workers in Liberia have tested positive for the virus and are being treated there. US health officials said Monday [28 Jul 2014] that the risk of the deadly germ spreading to the United States is remote.

The mere prospect of EVD in Africa's most populous nation has Nigerians on edge. In Nigeria's capital, Abuja, a 35-year-old male entrepreneur, said he is particularly concerned about taking the bus, which is the only affordable way to travel. "It's actually making me very nervous. If I had my own car, I would be safer," he said. "The doctors are on strike, and that means they are not prepared for it. For now I'm trying to be very careful." It's an unprecedented public health scenario: Since 1976, when the virus was 1st discovered, EVD outbreaks were limited to remote corners of [Sudan] Congo and Uganda, far from urban centers, and stayed within the borders of a single country. This time, cases 1st emerged in Guinea, and before long hundreds of others were stricken in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Those are some of the poorest countries in the world, with few doctors and nurses to treat sick patients let alone determine who is well enough to travel. In Sawyer's case, it appears nothing was done to question him until he fell sick on his 2nd flight with Asky Airlines. An airline spokesman would not comment on what precautions were being taken in the aftermath of Sawyer's journey. Liberian Assistant Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah told AP last week that there had been no screening at Liberia's Monrovia airport. That changed quickly over the weekend, when President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said a new policy on inspecting and testing all outgoing and incoming passengers will be strictly observed. She also announced that some borders were being closed and communities with large numbers of EVD cases would be quarantined.

International travelers departing from the capitals of Sierra Leone and Guinea are also being checked for signs of fever, airport officials said. Buckets of chlorine are also on hand at Sierra Leone's airport in Freetown for disinfection, authorities said. Still, detecting Ebola in departing passengers might be tricky, since its initial symptoms are similar to many other diseases, including malaria and typhoid fever. "It will be very difficult now to contain this outbreak because it's spread," Heymann said. "The chance to stop it quickly was months ago before it crossed borders ... but this can still be stopped if there is good hospital infection control, contact tracing and collaboration between countries."

Nigerian authorities so far have identified 59 people who came into contact with Sawyer and have tested 20, said Lagos State Health Commissioner Jide Idris. Among them were officials from ECOWAS [Economic Community of West African States], airline employees, health workers and the Nigerian ambassador to Liberia, he said. He said there have been no new cases of the disease.

[5] USA: low risk (CDC)

From a CDC Briefing
CDC: Ebola poses very low risk to US health care workers
--------------------------------------------------------
Standard barrier nursing protocols that have been in place in the USA since recognition of HIV will be adequate to protect health care workers in the unlikely event that patients who contracted the ebolavirus in Africa present to a US emergency department or physician's office, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] said during a 28 Jul 2014 press briefing.

Since March 2014, 672 people have died during the ongoing Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in Western Africa, according to Dr. Steve Monroe, director of the CDC Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. 2 [US] health care workers, both in Monrovia, Liberia, have presented with EVD. One is symptomatic and in isolation; the other has fever but no other symptoms. Transmission of the virus to health care workers seems to have occurred via needle stick or contact with infected bodily fluids, according to Dr. Monroe.

In 2008, 2 cases of Marburg virus infection occurred in Western Europe. Marburgvirus is a hemorrhagic fever virus that is a close cousin to ebolavirus, Dr. Monroe noted. Both patients were managed by way of standard barrier nursing precautions already in place, and those precautions were sufficient to protect physicians and nurses involved in their care. "If a case [of EVD] were to show up in the USA, I'm confident that we are already doing what needs to be done to prevent virus transmission to health care workers," he said.

The disease cannot be spread by asymptomatic people, according to Dr. Monroe. And if a symptomatic person travels on an airplane, it is unlikely that fellow travelers will be exposed to infected bodily secretions, he added. One case of an EVD patient traveling by air has been noted. The man flew from Liberia to Lagos, Nigeria, where he died. The countries involved in the outbreak have stepped up efforts to screen for fever and other signs of the disease those travelers who seek to leave their countries. Only 50 percent of infected people present with hemorrhage; others present with the vague symptoms of fever, headache, muscle aches, and vomiting.

[There was another case in 1996 when an EVD-infected doctor flew from Gabon to South Africa. None of the passengers or other contacts caught it from him, except his hospital nurse, who died; he recovered. See ProMED-mail archive WER Contents, 29 Nov 1996 19961129.1990.

CDC emphasizes that EVD cannot be spread by people with no symptoms, and only half of the victims show external bleeding. Recommendations publicized in EVD-affected countries should take these facts into account, and not prohibit contact between people with no symptoms.

In Liberia, the Roberts International Airport, the nation's only international airport, says it is putting in place measures to help prevent the spread of the virus. As of Monday [28 Jul 2014], all people without business at the airport, including family members and well-wishers, will not be allowed to enter the premises of the airport (http://frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/news/2492-roberts-intl-airport-puts-ebola-preventive-measures-in-place).

A new WHO update dated 27 Jul 2014, at http://who.int/csr/don/2014_07_27_ebola/en, does not provide any new case or death figures beyond 23 Jul 2014, already posted on ProMED on 25 Jul 2014, but adds a report on the Nigeria case, without giving any final confirmation that it was EVD (but a knowledgeable source informs ProMED that there is no reason to doubt the diagnosis by the Nigerian lab).
