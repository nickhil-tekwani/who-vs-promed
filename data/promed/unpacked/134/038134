Two heroin users have become ill with botulism, and a 3rd is showing
symptoms of the infection, which can cause paralysis and death,
according to Los Angeles County public health officials. The cases,
all in the Long Beach-South Bay area, have led authorities to suspect
that the local heroin supply may be contaminated with [spores of the]
toxin-producing bacteria.

Most of the heroin sold in California comes from Mexico and is sold
as a viscous dark-colored liquid, instead of the refined, white
powder variety from Asia.

Dr Jonathan Fielding, Los Angeles County's public health director,
said anyone with symptoms of botulism needs to go to an emergency room.

There are about 30 cases of wound botulism nationwide every year.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _C. botulinum_ contaminate a
wound, germinate and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of
the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs).
Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or
intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending,
flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the
severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early
in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the
results of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical
debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse
after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl
penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of 7 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of
both foodborne and wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced
by toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of
paralysis and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical
ventilation. All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic
system at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking
acetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction. - Mod.LL
