The Center for Health Protection (CHP) of Hong Kong's Department of
Health Thursday [12 Mar 2009] called on people to maintain strict
personal and environmental hygiene to prevent hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD), following an outbreak of the disease involving 20 students.

The affected children of the kindergarten in Tai Po, Hong Kong, aged
between 2 and 5 years, came from 4 different classes. They developed
fever, oral ulcers and rash over hands or feet starting from 22 Feb
2009. The children sought medical consultation, and no
hospitalization was required. All children are in stable condition.

A CHP spokesman said CHP staff had paid site visits to the school and
provided health advice to the management.

Further to the 2 confirmed Enterovirus-71 (EV71) cases reported
earlier, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of
Health is investigating the 3rd confirmed case this year [2009] and
urged the public to be vigilant against the disease.

A CHP spokesman said today [11 Mar 2009] that the latest case
involved a 3-year-old girl who developed symptoms of hand foot mouth
disease (HFMD), such as oral ulcers and rash over hands and feet, on
3 Mar 2009. She sought medical treatment and did not require
hospitalisation. She is now in stable condition. Her stool specimen
tested positive for EV71. Her father also developed symptoms of HFMD.
He consulted a doctor and did not require hospitalisation. His
condition is now stable.

All the 3 confirmed cases of EV71 attended HKSPC Sze Wu Shu Min
Nursery School. 13 other children in the same school had also
developed HFMD symptoms since 2 Mar 2009. All of them sought medical
treatment and are in stable condition. The school has suspended
classes starting today [11 Mar 2009] until 24 Mar 2009 for thorough
disinfection.

For more information, members of the public may visit the CHP's

Hotline 2833 0111.

[Outbreaks of HFMD characteristically begin in early spring and
increase in extent during summer. Several enteroviruses may be
responsible for HFMD. Historically, outbreaks in Asia due to
enterovirus 71 infection have been more severe, and the early
occurrence of enterovirus 71 infection is a cause for concern.
Currently, cases of HFMD have been reported also in Taiwan (see:
Enterovirus 71 (02): Taiwan 20090312.1020). - Mod.CP]
