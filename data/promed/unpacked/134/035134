The German constitutional court upheld the country's measles vaccine mandate for children on Thursday [18 Aug 2022], ruling against a challenge brought by parents.

In its final decision on the matter, the court in Karlsruhe said that while the mandate interfered with the rights of children and their parents, this was justified due to the high infection risk with measles and potential for serious illness.

The measles vaccine mandate came into effect in March 2020 and requires all children to be vaccinated or have already recovered from a course of the disease in order to attend kindergarten or child care facilities.

Exceptions are allowed only if the child has a medical intolerance for the vaccine.

[This is good news. The measles vaccine is a safe and effective combined vaccine that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella viruses.

Measles can lead to severe disease in unvaccinated individuals, and importantly, measles infections in children can wipe out the immune system's memory of other illnesses such as influenza.

The Zimbabwe government has invoked the Civil Protection Unit Act to deal with the measles outbreak that has so far claimed 157 lives from complications after spreading across the country.

"The nation is being informed that following a report of the 1st case of measles in Mutasa District, Manicaland Province on 10 Aug 2022, the disease has now spread to other provinces.

"As of 15 Aug 2022, the cumulative figures from across the country had risen to 2056 cases, and 157 deaths," said Minister Mutsvangwa.

Manicaland has recorded the highest number of cases and deaths with 1270 cases and 122 deaths, Harare 121 cases and 0 deaths, Midlands 83 cases and 16 deaths, Masvingo 116 cases and 3 deaths, Mashonaland East 115 cases and 16 deaths, Mashonaland Central 87 cases and 0 deaths, Mashonaland West 130 cases and 0 deaths, Matabeleland North 85 and 0 deaths, Matabeleland South 23 cases and 0 deaths, and Bulawayo 12 cases and 0 deaths.

Most cases reported among children within the targeted age group for vaccination are from religious sects who are not vaccinated against measles due to religious beliefs.

He said measles is a highly contagious respiratory tract viral infection commonly found in children and is spread through sneezing, coughing, and by touching or contact with secretions of an affected individual. Symptoms start with a cough, fever, and then skin rash, the high fever usually begins about 10-12 days after exposure to the virus and lasts 4-7 days.

Dr Chimedza said other symptoms include a runny nose, a cough, red and watery eyes, and small white spots inside the cheeks can develop in the initial stage, after several days, a rash erupts on the face and spreads to the whole body.

"The public is advised that the risk of developing a severe form of measles or dying from complications of measles is very high among unvaccinated children under 15 years.

"Additionally, we are instituting a mass vaccination campaign targeting the 6 months-15 years' age groups regardless of their vaccination status," said Dr Chimedza.
