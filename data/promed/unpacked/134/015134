[1] Cholera - Nigeria

The outbreak of cholera is growing and expanding in the west African country of Nigeria, as the bacterial disease is being reported in higher numbers from more states. According to the Nigerian news source The Guardian, statistics from the Ministry of Health on Thursday [31 Oct 2013] indicated that 1623 cases had been recorded, while 86 deaths had been reported.

The breakdown of cases is as follows: Zamfara State has the highest figure of 1110 cases and 51 deaths, while Plateau State has 130 cases and 11 deaths. Others are Lagos State (134 cases, 4 deaths), Ogun State (115 cases, 5 deaths), Nasarawa State (105 cases, 9 deaths) and Oyo State (29 cases, 6 deaths).

"The outbreak in the states mentioned earlier has been confirmed by our laboratories to be caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ serotypes 01 and 0139. The affected states are being supported to respond to the outbreak by supplying them with emergency drugs, diagnostic kits and other commodities," Special Assistant on Media and Communications, Mr. Dan Nwomeh said.

The infection is often mild or without symptoms but can sometimes be severe. Approximately one in 20 (5 percent) infected persons will have severe disease characterized by profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In these people, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.

[2] Dysentery - Zimbabwe (Masvingo), prison

An outbreak of dysentery has hit Masvingo's Mutimurefu Prison and surrounding areas, where nearly 170 cases were reported in the last 2 weeks. There are also unconfirmed reports that the outbreak also claimed one inmate at the prison before the pandemic was finally contained. Out of the 170 cases that were reported, 129 cases were among inmates in the prison, while 39 cases were reported in the Mutimurefu Prison's immediate neighboring community.

Indications are that the outbreak was caused by contaminated water, and the ministry of Health and Child Care, the Zimbabwe National Water Authority, and the International Red Cross Society have since completed an exercise to upgrade and chlorinate the facility's water supply system.

Acting Masvingo provincial medical director Dr Kudzai Masinire on Monday [28 Oct 2013] confirmed the outbreak of the disease at Mutimurefu Prison and surrounding areas, which he said had been contained. Dr Masinire said the water supply system at the prison had been upgraded.

He added that there was nothing conclusive to suggest that the death of an inmate at the prison during the time of the outbreak was caused by dysentery.
