Leishmaniaisis in Calcutta
--------------------------
CALCUTTA, Oct. 17. - Kala-azar is back in Calcutta after 39 years. And the
sandfly, which carries kala-azar [agent], has found its first quarry in a
Nimtala Ghat Street teenager. The School of Tropical Medicine's discovery
has sent alarm signals to the state government. Spleen and bone marrow
tests of the 19 year old [patient] revealed the kala-azar causing protozoan
- _Leishmania donovani_. Checking his case history, doctors realised that
the youth hadn't ventured out of the city for more than 15 years. So, he
must have been bitten by a kala-azar vector in Calcutta itself. A team led
by Dr N Tandon, head of the department of medical entomology, went to
Nimtala Ghat Street the following week and began investigations. [The
teenager] may be the sole kala-azar patient in his area, but sandflies were
found outside his room too.
"This is a very alarming development. Unless the problem is nipped in the
bud, the situation might turn as bad as Bihar," the STM director, Prof. PK
Sarkar, told The Statesman today. The director has informed the health
ministry and CMC's health wing. A message will also be sent to the World
Health Organisation. Officials from the health directorate visited STM
today, to learn more about the discovery.
The last recorded indigenous kala-azar case in the city was in 1961. A STM
study in 1969 found that _Phlebotomus argentipes_ (commonly called sandfly)
did exist in some districts, but not in the metropolis. Antecedents of the
patients treated here have always been traced to Bihar or some other sand
fly-infested area - but never to Calcutta. Between 1917 and 1929, the city
was under a severe kala-azar epidemic; the incidence diminished gradually,
and disappeared after the National Malaria Eradication Programme took off
in 1953. DDT used to be sprayed in city areas as part of the NMEP. The
drive went on for nearly 2 decades, until the Left Front government stopped
spraying. "Had they continued the drive the sand flies couldn't have bred
even after so many years," said a STM scientist.
All these years the kala-azar vector had confined its flight to Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Chennai and a few districts of Tamil Nadu.
Bihar, the closest to West Bengal, sends many patients to STM and other
government hospitals here.
Dr Tandon said: "Tracing _P. argentipes_ is a specialised job. Sandflies
usually hide between cracks or in the space between bricks of bare walls."
But [the teenager's] room is a plastered one.
The entomologist said some conditions in the Nimtala Ghat houses were quite
suitable for the flies. The houses are dark and damp. "[The patient] and
his neighbours live in abysmally unhygienic conditions in rooms which are
as little as 7-feet by 7-feet. Light doesn't enter the rooms and they are
forever moist."
The scientists are not sure how the flies have been breeding in Nimtala
Ghat Street. A point to jot down is that many of [the patient's] neighbours
often travel to UP and Bihar. "But this doesn't explain the breeding of the
kala-azar vector," Dr Tandon said. There is more to the investigation, she
said.

[The report suggests that this is the first report of sandflies in Calcutta
since the mass spraying campaigns of the malaria eradication programme in
1953. If this is indeed the case, the health authorities need to monitor
the situation closely. _Leishmania_ infection is usually a zoonotic
infection with reservoirs in India, in for instance, gerbils. It remains to
be seen whether this is an isolated case or whether _Leishmania_ has
established a reservoir close to Calcutta from which humans may be
infected. - Mod.EP]
