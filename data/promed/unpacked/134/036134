Virus threatens rare parrot
---------------------------
A virus is threatening the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot in
Australia.

The common stomach virus found in many Australian birds is striking the
orange-bellied parrot at a breeding program for the bird. The virus causes
the birds' immune system to break down.

Shane Radial, a professor of Veterinary Science at Charles Sturt
University, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. an outbreak of the
disease in the captive breeding program could be fatal for the species, as
there are only 50 birds left in the wild. In captivity "infections just
find it easier to spread from one bird to another," he said. Radial says
there is no known cure for the virus.

The Zoos Victoria website says there are 160-170 of the birds in the
breeding program at Healesville Sanctuary, Adelaide Zoo, and Taroona
(Tasmania).

[While I am not sure what the stomach virus in these parrots is, it could
be either avian influenza affecting the gastrointestinal tract or it could
be proventricular dilatation disease (PDD).

If it is the latter, the proventriculus (forestomach) is thin-walled and
"flabby", and is unable to digest food or move it properly along. Diagnosis
of the disease has been hampered because the true cause or causes of the
disease are not known.

In addition, clear evidence of the disease, found in biopsy samples or
tissue samples from deceased birds, is found at the end stage of the
disease. At this stage, plasma cells and lymphocytes may invade the area
around nerve cell bodies or ganglia in the wall of the 1st part of the
gastrointestinal tract -- from the crop to the stomach and duodenum. These
cells can also invade parts of the brain, resulting in a condition called
non-suppurative encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). It appears that
the accumulation of these lymphocyte and plasma cells around nerves and
their cell bodies alters the gastrointestinal tract's function and/or
causes problems with the brain, depending on where these cells localize.

PDD can be devastating and cause death to the patient, but may cause
varying signs that come and go or maybe never occur. Birds may be positive
on viral testing but be normal in appearance (asymptomatic) or have
occasional bouts. Some birds may show clinical signs but when the crop or
stomach is biopsied, the histopathologic findings that must be present to
call it PDD are not there.

Many birds with PDD may have diarrhea with undigested food in their
droppings. Some may regurgitate hours after eating. These birds may waste
over time with reduced pectoral muscle mass and a pronounced keel. This
tends to be more common in young macaws and adult Amazons.

Other birds may exhibit neurologic signs -- they may appear to seizure but
often bob, have trouble placing their feet so appear to move them and their
legs stiffly, and revert to baby behaviors. Some birds may go blind. The
birds that tend to have neurologic signs are cockatoos and African grey
parrots. Eclectus parrots may have GI and/or neurologic signs. But not all
birds follow the rules.

While I speculate that it could be PDD, it may not be. If a knowledgeable
source in Australia can send an authoritative report it would be appreciated.
