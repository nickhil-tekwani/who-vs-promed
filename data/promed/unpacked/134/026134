Written ministerial statement by Hilary Benn on the avian influenza
case in Dorset -- 15 Jan 2008
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Hilary Benn)

Between 27 Dec 2007 and 4 Jan 2008, 3 mute swans were found in a
swannery and its vicinity near Chesil Beach; preliminary reports
suggest that 2 of the swans were still alive when located but were
euthanased due to injuries and poor condition. The 3rd was already
dead. Two were found through regular patrols by the swannery's staff
as part of Defra's routine dead wild bird surveillance programme, and
a third was found by a member of the public.

Targeted surveillance for avian influenza in wild birds is in place
throughout the UK and focuses on species that are most likely to
spread the disease and on high-risk areas where there is a greater
abundance of poultry and waterfowl. More than 6000 birds were tested
last year [2007] alone.

The numbers of birds tested is in part dependent on the numbers of
birds found dead by regular patrols of certain wetland reserves or
reported by the public. There have been over 2000 patrols undertaken
since the start of this migration period in September/October [2007]
at over 200 sites . The number of dead birds can be lower during a
milder year. No cuts have been made to active patrolling or testing
and in some areas patrolling has been increased due to national and
international avian influenza incidents.

In the case of the swans found in Dorset, there was no immediate
cause to suspect disease, and as the cases did not appear unusual
given mortality rates among the local swan population, the Swannery
held the carcasses until Mon 7 Jan [2008], when they first reported
them to Defra. The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC), which is
Defra's contracted collection agent for the wild bird surveillance
programme, then collected the carcasses and delivered them on the
same day to the local regional laboratory of the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency at Starcross in Exeter. There, post mortem
examinations and sample collections were carried out prior to courier
dispatch of the samples for avian influenza testing at the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA), in Weybridge, Surrey, which is the World
Animal Health Organisation (OIE) Reference Laboratory for Avian
Influenza. This was conducted as part of routine surveillance, and
the collection, storage, and transportation of the samples to the
laboratory, and their testing, were entirely consistent with
international standards.

On the evening of Wed 9 Jan [2008], preliminary results indicated the
presence of H5N1 (but not the pathogenicity). The VLA immediately
informed Defra which sought expert ornithological advice on the
following day about the restrictions that might be needed. At
lunchtime on 10 Jan [2008], following further laboratory tests, the
acting chief veterinary officer was able to confirm that highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza [HPAI] had been found in the 3 swans.

Wild Bird Control and Monitoring Areas were immediately put in place
around the swannery. The boundary of the control area has been set to
meet EU requirements for a 3 km (2 mi) minimum radius, and
encompasses an appropriate area around Chesil beach and Portland
Bill. The boundary of the monitoring area meets the minimum
requirement for a 10 km (6 mi) radius and an appropriate area around
the Wild Bird Control Area. The boundaries were determined following
advice from expert ornithologists who took into consideration the
location of local bird reserves and the presence of wild bird
populations. This advice also gives us some confidence that birds in
this area have not moved widely and therefore there is no scientific
justification for requiring birds to be housed, or bird gatherings to
be banned, in the rest of the country outside the Wild Bird Monitoring Area.

Inside these areas, no poultry or other captive bird movements from
premises are permitted, all birds must be housed or otherwise
isolated from contact with wild birds, no wild birds may be hunted,
and all bird gatherings are banned. Biosecurity measures apply on
premises where poultry or captive birds are kept. We are currently
working with industry to determine the availability of licenses for
movements from premises and for hunting of wild birds.

Soon after confirmation, Defra (using the Poultry Register) sent a
text message to all those who had registered a mobile phone number
with the register. Two messages were sent; one to keepers in the
Control and Monitoring Areas, and one to all those in England and
Wales. Known keepers registered on Animal Health's database --
excluding those who had already received a message via the poultry
register -- were also sent a voicemail message.

On 11 Jan [2008], information packs were posted to all known poultry
premises in the Control and Monitoring Areas. These packs have also
been distributed by Animal Health vets during surveillance visits in the field.

One member of the public and 11 reserve staff have been assessed for
possible risk to their health by the Health Protection Agency (HPA),
7 of whom have been given precautionary courses of antiviral drugs
because of their close contact with infected or potentially infected
birds. None of these people is ill. Vaccination with seasonal human
influenza vaccines has also been administered to this group of
people. The HPA advise that the risk to the general public is very low.

While surveillance and testing continue, no evidence of disease has
been found in domestic poultry or other captive birds. There will be
no culling of wild birds because such action might disperse birds
further creating a risk of disease spread. While our policy on
vaccination is kept under continuous review, experts advise us that
it would not assist disease control in this case.

A full epidemiological investigation is underway to determine the
source of infection. The strain of the virus identified is very
similar to that causing the cases confirmed in the Czech Republic,
Romania, and Poland mid to late last year [2007]. It is less similar
to that found in East Anglia in November [2007]. We are also carrying
out increased surveillance in the area to look for any further
carcasses of wild birds for testing, in addition to our routine
collection and testing of certain species of dead wild birds in areas
of the rest of the country with higher wild bird and poultry density.
All premises in the Control Area with domestic poultry are being
visited by Animal Health staff to look for presence of disease. We
are making a rapid assessment of the risk to captive birds and
poultry in the wider area so that we can consider whether we need to
further enhance surveillance of wild and captive birds, and advise
local poultry keepers about preventative measures they should take.

Trade in poultry and poultry products to other EU member states from
outside the control and monitoring areas can carry on largely
unaffected. Exports of poultry and poultry products to non-EU
countries are already very limited because, following the H5N1
outbreak in Suffolk in November last year [2007], the UK is currently
not officially free from avian influenza according to the OIE -- the
World Organisation for Animal Health. As these new cases have been
found in wild birds our intention to regain our "officially free"
status later this year [2008] is not affected.

I wish to stress as before that avian influenza is largely a disease
of birds. The virus does not easily cross from birds to infect
humans; in almost all instances, such transmission requires extremely
close contact with infected birds, particularly faeces. The fact that
disease has been found in wild birds rather than poultry makes no
difference to the human health risk.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all those in
Defra, Animal Health, other partners, and especially the relevant
local authorities for their usual professional and rapid response.

A 4th swan has tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu
in Dorset, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(Defra) said today [16 Jan 2008].

Officials revealed on Thursday [9 Jan 2008] that 3 birds had tested
positive for the virus at the Abbotsbury swannery during routine surveillance.

A 3 km (2 mi) control zone and a 10 km (6 mi) monitoring area were
set up around the swannery to try to stop the strain spreading.

Fred Landeg, the government's acting chief veterinary officer, last
week warned bird keepers to be vigilant. He said there was a
"constant low-level risk" of avian influenza being introduced into the UK.

Government vets plan to test 800 swans.

The outbreak poses little risk to humans but staff were being
monitored for symptoms and were handed Tamiflu tablets as a precaution.

Farmers and bird keepers have been ordered to isolate flocks from
wild birds near the swannery. As yet, no disease has been found in
domestic birds.

Defra said last week that there were no plans to cull wild flocks
because it might disperse birds.

The latest outbreak came less than a month after restrictions on
poultry movement were lifted in Norfolk and Suffolk. The restrictions
were imposed after an outbreak of H5N1 on a free-range turkey farm in
November [2007].

Wild birds are the likely source of infection, but Andre Farrar, of
the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds), said it was
"slightly odd" that the outbreak happened outside a migration period.

One possibility was that the virus had been brought to the region
some time ago but only recently infected the birds.

The swannery, a tourist attraction close to Chesil beach, claims to
be the only managed colony of mute swans in the world. It was
established by Benedictine monks in the 11th century.

Bird flu has spread to another district in Bangladesh, forcing
authorities to cull more than 1500 birds, officials said on Wednesday
[16 Jan 2008].

The H5N1 bird flu virus was reported in backyard poultry in the
southern coastal district Barishal [Barisal], a livestock department
official said.

"After the confirmation of bird flu, authorities culled more than
1531 chickens, ducks and birds in a 1 km area around the affected
backyard poultry," the official said.

Suspected outbreaks were also reported at a farm in northwestern
Rajshahi district and another farm in northern Rangpur district,
where the virus has been confirmed in fowl previously.

"The preliminary tests showed some birds at the farm have died from
bird flu, but we still don't know whether it is the deadly H5N1
strain," the official told Reuters, referring to the farm in Rajshahi.

The H5N1 avian flu virus was first reported near the capital in March
last year [2007] and has since spread mainly to northern districts,
forcing authorities to kill more than 300 000 chickens.

With the latest outbreak, 72 farms in 23 of Bangladesh's 64 districts
have been infected with the deadly virus.

There are around 150 000 poultry farms in Bangladesh, with an annual
turnover of USD 750 million, officials say.

So far there have been no cases of human infection in the densely
populated country, government officials say.

Experts fear the bird flu virus might mutate or combine with the
highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic that
could kill millions of people.

There have been 217 human deaths globally from the H5N1 strain and
350 confirmed cases of infection since 2003, World Health
Organisation (WHO) figures show.
