In China, during surveys conducted in the main stone fruit production regions in 2008-2018, _Plum pox virus_ (_Potyvirus_, PPV - EPPO A2 List) was detected on _Prunus mume_ [Japanese apricot) and on _P. armeniaca_ [common apricot] in a number of provinces [see comment below for additional information].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous to this survey, incidence and distribution of PPV in China was unclear. The results suggest that PPV is widely distributed on both of the apricot species. An average rate of symptoms above 30% was recorded in _P. mume_. In samples from Beijing, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Wuxi and Yuncheng, PPV was detected in 77% (85 out of 110) of collected samples by molecular diagnostic methods. 96% (67 of 70) of samples showing Sharka symptoms were PPV positive. Sequencing results of 4 isolates (3 _P. mume_, 1 one _P. armeniaca_) showed that all belonged to the PPV-D clade.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa and the Americas, but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 percent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato and a number of weedy annual plants. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into strains, some of which do not infect certain _Prunus_ species. Strains of PPV-D (as identified in the survey above) infect peach, plum and apricot.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools), grafting, as well as by infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. For some PPV strains, resistant cultivars are available in several types of stone fruits. Specific molecular tests have been developed to distinguish viral strains.
