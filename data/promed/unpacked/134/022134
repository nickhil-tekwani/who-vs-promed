The History of Marburg Disease from 1967 to the Present
-------------------------------------------------------
In the posting "Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Uganda (08)," posted on 5 Feb
2001, I am credited with assisting in the compilation of the report by Dr
Michael Koch entitled, "An erroneous reference to an outbreak of Marburg
fever in Uganda". It is true that I was asked by the moderator whether I
was aware of an outbreak of Marburg disease in Uganda in 1976, to which I
replied that I felt certain that there was no such outbreak, and added some
remarks on early outbreaks of the disease. However, I would stop short of
claiming that I assisted in the compilation of the list of confirmed
outbreaks of Marburg disease, particularly since I believe that there some
inaccuracies in the report.
The total number of cases quoted by Dr Koch for the original 1967 outbreaks
in Marburg, Frankfurt, and Belgrade amounts to 31, whereas he correctly
reports the total as 32: an extra case was added to the original total on
the basis of retrospective detection of antibody some years after the
epidemic by Dr W Slenczka, as cited by Feldmann et al (Arch Virol Suppl
1996; 11: 77-100).
The statement: "The next year in 1976 the first outbreaks of hemorrhagic
fever caused by Ebola virus, which proved to be a genetically and
antigenically distinct filovirus, were recorded" is contentious, because
1976 Sudan and Zaire Ebola isolates are genetically distinct from each
other and sufficiently antigenically distinct so as not to be cross-protective.
The taxonomy of the Ebola viruses remains unresolved, and it is debatable
whether they should continue to be designated as "types" of a single virus,
or given separate names. [This statement in the report was inserted by the
moderator and was based on interpretation of the current taxonomy of the
family _Filoviridae_ (vide, Virus Taxonomy, 7th Report of the ICTV,
Academic Press, 2000), wherein Zaire Ebola virus, Sudan Ebola virus, Reston
Ebola virus and Cote d'Ivoire Ebola virus are designated as species of the
same genus, whereas Marburg virus is classified as the sole representative
of a different genus. I did not intend to imply that the Zaire and Sudan
isolates of Ebola virus are identical. - Mod.CP.
The initial case of Marburg disease in the 1980 outbreak in Kenya occurred
in a 56 year old expatriate Frenchman (Smith et al Lancet 1982; 1: 816-20)
and not in a 58 year old Kenyan as stated. Likewise, the patient who died
of Marburg disease in Kenya in 1987 was not from Mombasa, but a 15 year old
European male [Danish who had been in the country for one month [visiting
his missionary parents (Johnson et al Arch Virol Suppl 1996; 11: 101-14).
The evidence for Marburg disease in the Swedish tourist who returned from
Kenya in 1990 (transient antibody activity in his serum) is far from
conclusive and the summary of the publication describing the case
concludes: "Data suggest that this patient may have been infected with a
filovirus. This case demonstrates the difficulties that may occur in
laboratory diagnosis of viral haemorrhagic fevers" (Kenyon et al. Research
in Virol 1994; 145: 397-406). [Similarly, Marburg disease was reported in
1982 in a young man who had recently come from Zimbabwe to South Africa, on
the basis of transient antibody activity (Gear. Yale J Biol Med 1982; 55:
207-12), but it was subsequently reported that the diagnosis should be
regarded as unsubstantiated (Swanepoel. S Afr J Sci 1987; 83: 80-8).
As far as the 1998-2000 outbreak of Marburg disease in northeastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is concerned, our laboratory
performed the bulk of the tests on specimens from suspected patients (some
specimens were tested by our colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta, notably skin snips taken post mortem for
immunohistochemical examination), and our findings were made known to the
relevant officials in the DRC, and to other individuals and organizations
involved in the investigations. Some specimens were only received and
investigated comparatively recently, and so no doubt a certain amount of
collating of the information remains to be done. However, it is not our
prerogative to make the findings public here, just as your physician or
laboratory cannot unilaterally decide to declare your personal medical
history to the world. Nevertheless, if we confine ourselves to the fatality
rate of 69/103 (67%) cited by Dr Koch, then it is evident that Marburg
disease can be as lethal as Ebola fever in a rural setting in Africa.
As reported by ProMED-mail, we recently received a series of specimens from
several countries in east and central Africa to be tested for viral
hemorrhagic fevers in the wake of the Ebola fever epidemic in Uganda. In
these instances also we are obliged to make known the results of our tests
to those who sent the specimens and not to ProMED-mail -- which is not to
say that we would discourage the people concerned from reporting to
ProMED-mail. Indeed, if one of the hemorrhagic fevers were diagnosed we
would make every effort to ensure that the outbreak is made known to the
relevant international authorities. We are a World Health Organization
(WHO) Collaborating Centre, and WHO is almost invariably involved with
specimens sent to us, usually through their Country Representative, so in
any event they are almost automatically notified of our findings. Hence, it
can be deduced that none of the recent specimens from countries other than
Uganda were positive for any of the viral hemorrhagic fevers, but I would
like to add that ProMED-mail sometimes incorrectly reports that specimens
are being, or have been, sent to us.
