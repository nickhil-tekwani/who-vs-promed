In Malaysia, bananas are being commercialized for export. Cavendish
[variety] is being planted on a few sites, in dense stands allowing
pathogens and pests present in this region of co-evolution to reveal
their epidemic for the 1st time. These are as a rotation crop after
old palm oil [palms]. The plantations are severely affected by
fusarium wilt. The plantations were established with no concern for
this disease.

In Malaysia, banana is the 2nd most widely cultivated fruit, covering
about 26 000 ha (64 250 acres) with a total production of 530 000
metric tones. About 50 percent of the banana growing land is
cultivated with Pisang Berangan and the Cavendish type.

However, banana production in Malaysia has decreased because of an
increasing threat of diseases (particularly fusarium wilt), high
labor costs, and marketing issues. Banana cultivation is largely a
smallholder enterprise where farms are small, unorganized, and
farmers often adopt inferior technology.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt)
is caused by the soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp.
_cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of
pseudostem. Affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by
infected planting material, mechanical means, soil, and water, and
can survive in the soil for over 30 years. No effective chemical or
cultural control measures are known. Disease management includes
exclusion and eradication.

Several races of the pathogen exist. The recently emerged tropical
race 4 (TR4) is at present devastating Cavendish (_Musa_ AAA)
production throughout Southeast Asia. It continues to spread in the
region and represents a serious threat to banana production
worldwide. It is likely that TR4 is causing the problems in Malaysia
described above. Cultivars for commercial use, which are resistant or
tolerant to the new race are being developed, but are not yet
available.

PD has been a major problem for banana cultivation worldwide for over
a century. It forced the changeover from previously used highly
susceptible banana cultivars to the then resistant Cavendish
varieties. However, the pathogen has adjusted, causing large-scale
destruction once again. For further information on PD please see
previous posts and links listed below.

Cavendish is a group of banana cultivars with a triploid genome
derived from _M. acuminata_, which is indicated by the letters AAA.
For more information on banana cultivars and hybrids please see the
previous ProMED-mail post no. 20070810.2601 and the link below.
