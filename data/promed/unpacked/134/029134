The only community hospital in Okhaldhunga district has been flooded with viral fever and typhoid patients in the last few days. Doctors have said viral fever and typhoid cases have been rising due to the contamination of drinking water in the rainy season.

The inflow of patients has been so high that the hospital has not been able to cope this number. Some of the patients have been kept in the training hall and even on corridors for lack of beds. The hospital has only 32 beds whereas the number of patients admitted is in the range of 45-50 daily, said a doctor at the hospital.

More than 150 patients a day have been coming for treatment at the OPD [outpatient department] alone. More than 3200 patients came for treatment in July 2012 alone.

Meanwhile, 2 schools at Mainaghat of Nawalparasi district have been closed after the spread of viral fever in the area. The schools had to be closed since most of the students have been affected by the disease. The people are worried that the viral fever might take epidemic proportion as there is lack of health workers at the local health posts and primary health centre.

[The posting spends much of its narrative regarding the illness referred to as "viral fever" which is allegedly spread by contaminated water. It is unclear what the etiology of this "viral fever" is and ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding the outbreak which apparently is differentiable from typhoid. - Mod.LL
