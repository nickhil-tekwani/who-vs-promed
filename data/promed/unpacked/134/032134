About 300 immigrants being held at the Northwest Detention Center in
Tacoma (WA) spent the early part of this week recovering from
suspected food poisoning.
Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department officials said they were
contacted Sat 11 Aug 2007, after about 180 detainees were treated for
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting at the detention center clinic.
The immigrants had been served 3 meals that day that included
hamburger-potato casserole for lunch and beef sausage and coleslaw
for dinner. Most began showing symptoms late Sat 11 Aug 2007,
Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Lorie Dankers said,
adding that detention center staff, who sometimes eat there, also got
ill.
Joby Winans, public health-information officer, said Tacoma-Pierce
County health officials were at the detention center on 12 through 14
Aug 2007 to try to determine what made so many people sick.
"It's a scientific mystery at this point," Winans said. "The good
news is that no one was seriously ill. They were uncomfortable, yes,
but not seriously ill." By Tue 14 Aug 2007, most people appeared to
have recovered.
The facility must adhere to strict national standards for food
preparation, and a licensed, trained chef oversees the preparations.
"We serve 1000 people 3 hot meals a day," Dankers said.
The Department of Homeland Security contracts with The GEO Group, a
national detention management company, to run the detention center,
which opened in April 2004. It primarily houses immigrants from
Washington, Oregon and Alaska facing deportation, although more
recently it also has held people brought in from elsewhere.
Health officials have been at the center all week looking at how food
is prepared and interviewing those who got sick about what they ate
and making comparisons to those who didn't become ill.

[This relatively large, presumed but not proven foodborne illness,
has affected about 30 percent of the population at the detention
center. More information may become available to pinpoint a vehicle
of transmission and an agent. If it were an illness with a short
incubation period (less than 12 hours) with prominent vomiting and
little fever, staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced disease may be at
work here.
