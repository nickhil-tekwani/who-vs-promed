Frankly, anthrax is rare in juvenile animals of whatever species, other than _Homo sapiens_ who get exposed when helping a relative slaughter and butcher a sick infected animal. But for livestock and wildlife, the usual juvenile problem is starvation when their mother dies of the disease. In Odisha, the veterinary services, livestock and wildlife, are very experienced with this disease so I do not doubt their diagnosis. But I do wonder how this elephant got infected and whether there might be other carcasses yet to be discovered. - Mod.MHJ]
