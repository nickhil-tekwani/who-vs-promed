Malaria still a threat in Mumbai
--------------------------------
The city, which reeled under the spell of malaria during the last monsoon,
hasn't been able to bounce back completely till now. Doctors claim that
they are still seeing several cases of the disease, which is unusual during
winter.

BMC [Bombay (now Mumbai) Municipal Corporation] statistics show that, with
a total of 4391 people testing positive, there was a positivity rate of
3.07 per cent for malaria in December 2010. The current rate is 2.6 per
cent. Not only are Mumbaikars suffering from a spate of malaria, but a
severe one at that, say doctors.

Dr Khusrav Bajan, physician and intensivist at Hinduja Hospital in Mahim,
said a number of malaria patients had to be admitted. "We admitted 4 cases
of a severe nature in just 2 days. It is really surprising as we generally
don't see many cases of severe malaria in December and January," he said.

A 49 year old patient has been admitted to KEM Hospital for the past 2
weeks. He has been suffering from intermittent fever accompanied by chills
and flu. His family, though, was not surprised to find out that he was
diagnosed with malaria. "Someone or the other from our locality keeps
getting fever. This has been happening for quite a few months. The doctors
have given medication, so my father should be fine soon," said the
patient's son. "There is a construction site nearby, because of which there
has been a mosquito menace," added the resident of a Wadala chawl [a group
of one or 2 room housing units].

Apart from the general symptoms of fever and chills, city doctors currently
claim that malaria is accompanied by other symptoms as well. "We recently
discharged a 72 year old man who had been shuffled from hospital to
hospital, which kept treating him for anaemia for 2 months. When he came to
us, the tests revealed that he was also suffering from falciparum malaria,"
said Dr Hemant Thacker, senior physician at Bombay Hospital. He added,
"Apart from anaemia, people are also suffering from chronicity and
unspecific fevers for a long period of time."

But Dr A R Pazare, head of medicine at KEM, said it was "not so out of the
ordinary" to see malaria cases even after the monsoon. "We do see malaria
cases in the months of October and November. Even in December and January,
there are a few cases," he added.

The BMC, too, said it was not an unusual phenomenon. Dr G T Ambe, executive
health officer, said: "Of the total number of slides taken in December,
4390 people tested positive. The positivity rate in December 2010 was less
than what we saw in 2009. Whatever cases we are getting are mainly due to
construction work."

[Reports of malaria in Mumbai continue to appear. It is difficult to
explain from construction sites alone and it appears that the infection is
actually widespread in the community. The last posting (Malaria - India,
(Mumbai): urban malaria comment 20110104.0040) linked the emergence of
malaria in urban Mumbai to increasing urbanization, and it is difficult to
continue to maintain that the situation is caused primarily by poorly
managed construction sites. - Mod.EP
