The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has claimed 2332 heads of cattle in Karnataka as per initial estimation, Animal Husbandry Minister T B Jayachandra said today [10 Oct 2013].

As many as 18 386 animals have been affected by the disease which has spread to 1507 villages in the last few days, he told reporters here.

He hastened to add that the figures were "tentative" and had been compiled as per information gathered by the Department and the Karnataka Milk Federation. "We have to see whether there was duplication".

The Minister blamed shortage of veterinary doctors and absence of universal vaccination for the outbreak of FMD.

As many [as] 950 veterinary doctors' posts are vacant in the department. Only 200 doctors have been discharging duties in the department and taken steps to control the disease.

All 26 doctors who are on deputation elsewhere have been told to return to the parent department. A decision has been taken to hire services of retired veterinary doctors to inject vaccination to cows, the Minister said.

Many cows died due to the viral infection. As a preventive measure, cattle have to be vaccinated twice a year. The disease affects early to high yielding cattle, particularly hybrid variety.

Besides forming teams of experts to check the spread of the FMD, Jayachandra said vaccination programme would be taken up on "pulse-polio mode".

Milk unions have been asked to give a compensation of INR 10 000 [USD 163] (per animal) for those families who had lost their cows due to the disease, and they have "by and large" agreed to do so, the Minister said.

The extent of compensation by the Government would be decided by the Cabinet, Jayachandra said.

There appears to be confusion and discrepancy over the number of cattle dying of FMD in the State [Karnataka], including Mysore district. The statistics over the death of cattle and animals affected provided by the Department of Animal Husbandry and the one submitted by the Karnataka Milk Federation [KMF] show a big difference. For instance, the department's figures, as on date [9 Oct 2013], in Mysore district is 74 and the number of affected cattle is 1637 against the KMF data of 327 and 4015, respectively.

As a result, Minister for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences, T.B. Jayachandra, who met the officials here, has ordered the formation of a committee, including the Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry, the Assistant Directors in the taluks, Tahsildars, panchayat development officers, to visit villages and assess ground realities and submit a report to the Minister in 15 days.

"We will go to villages, conduct investigation and, if necessary, retrieve carcasses to verify the number of deaths," Deputy Director of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences Department, Mysore, Devadas, told The Hindu.

Dr. Devadas said that the situation is under control in the district. As many as 74 deaths have occurred in the district Â­- 35 in T. Narsipur taluk, 21 in K.R. Nagar taluk, 15 in Mysore taluk and 3 in Hunsur taluk. The statistics provided by the KMF in other districts too showed high numbers with regard to affected animals and those that died. Of the 560 450 head of cattle in the district, 501 084 have been vaccinated since [1 Sep 2013], after the outbreak of the disease. The department hoped to achieve 100 per cent coverage in another 15 days, he said.

As far as vaccination is concerned, 98 per cent of head of cattle have been covered in Hunsur taluk, 94 per cent in Mysore taluk, 92 per cent in Nanjangud and H.D. Kote taluks, 88 per cent in Periyapatna taluk, 87 per cent in K.R. Nagar taluk and 77 per cent in T. Narsipur taluk.

The department has taken steps to vaccinate cattle for haemorrhagic septicaemia simultaneously as post-mortem in some cases had revealed the cause of death as "haemorrhagic septicaemia," Dr. Devadas said. More than 22 000 head of cattle had been administered haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine. As many as 124 villages in Mysore district had reported cases of FMD, Dr. Devadas confirmed.

All check posts along the borders with Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have been alerted not to let any cattle in from those states. All Deputy Commissioners across the State [Karnataka] have banned cattle or sheep fairs. And government officials are watching the skies, hoping the rain will stop.

The dreaded foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has spread to 17 482 cows and buffaloes and killed 2182 in 1368 villages of 7 South Karnataka districts. It does not affect humans or the milk produced by the cattle.

Animal husbandry officials admitted that there is cause for panic among the farmers. "For the last 5 years, we did not have very heavy rains, so the average temperature remained normal. We have not seen any major outbreak of the FMD at all. Now, because of the very heavy rainfall over the last few months, the temperature has been low, leading to a large scale breeding of the FMD virus," Co-Director (Livestock Health) Dr Nagaraj Shetty told Express.

Farmers, however, maintained that an ego clash between the Animal Husbandry Department and Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) had led to the situation.

The department figures show that 1.04 crore [10 400 000] of the 1.25 crore [12 500 000] cattle in the state have completed the August-September round of vaccinations under the Central scheme. "We will cover the rest within the next 2 weeks. We are confident we will control this outbreak," Commissioner Mohammed Salahuddin said.

Officials contended that farmers have not taken sufficient care to get all their cattle vaccinated, as there is fear that the cows will stop giving milk and the pregnant cows will abort, if vaccinated. "The cows may not give milk for one week, after which they will be fine. The FMD can be fatal, the farmers should realise this. And if the cow is pregnant, they should get it vaccinated after the calf is born, they don't do that," Salahuddin rued.

Siddaramaiah has set up a 7-member committee under former vice-chancellor of the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University, Dr Aryan Srinivas Gowda, to further investigate causes for the outbreak. There is a fear that the virus might have mutated and overpowered the vaccine.

[The FMD outbreak in the Indian state Karnataka (map at http://tinyurl.com/kk2zuux) has been spreading at least since mid-September 2013, accompanied by political struggles and media hype. The numbers of affected farms, sick animals and mortalities were varying, probably biased due to political considerations. However, the epizootic seems indeed to be of significant dimensions.

FMD is endemic in India; the virus serotypes circulating during 2012 were O, Asia1 and A. Until the mid-90s, serotype C was recorded as well (see WRLFMD India page at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/ind.htm).

Further to a previous, now repeated request for information on the serotype of the involved FMD virus, we would appreciate details, if available, on its genotyping results and of the virus strains included in the applied vaccine. - Mod.AS]
