Maine CDC has identified a human case of neuroinvasive eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE) [infection] in a mature adult who resides in York County. The individual became ill in late August [2014] and was hospitalized. Blood samples collected 1 Oct [2014] tested positive for EEE at a commercial lab. The sample was forwarded to Maine's Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL) where it tested positive on 9 Oct 2014. Per established protocols, the sample has been sent to the U.S. CDC for further confirmation. The individual is recovering at home.

This is the 1st human case of EEE [virus infection] identified in a Maine resident.

Maine CDC has detected EEE virus in 22 mosquito pools in York County, and an emu in Cumberland County. New Hampshire has identified EEE [virus infections] in humans, mammals and mosquitoes, and Massachusetts has identified EEE in mammals [antibodies?] and [the virus in] mosquitoes.

Symptoms of EEE disease often appear 4-10 days after someone is bitten by an infected mosquito. If you or someone you know is experiencing flu-like symptoms, including fever and headache, contact your local medical provider. EEE is a more serious disease than West Nile virus (WNV) and carries a high mortality rate for those who contract the serious encephalitis form of the illness. Symptoms may include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and sore throat. There is no specific treatment for the disease, which can lead to seizures and coma.

You can protect yourself and your family from EEE [virus infection] with a few simple steps, such as using effective mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, removing standing water from around your house so mosquitoes do not have a place to breed, and by checking doors and windows to ensure screens are in place and in good condition to prevent mosquitoes from entering your home.

[This has been an active summer and autumn season for EEE virus transmission in the northeastern USA. There have been several human and equine cases in this region this year (2014), and now the 1st human case has occurred in Maine in 2014.

Equine EEE virus infections occur sporadically in Maine, and 2009 was a particularly active year. It is not surprising that the occasional human case will occur there. There was one human case in 2008 that may have been acquired in Maine, but that individual had traveled to other neighboring states where EEE virus transmission occurs as well. Transmission will cease after the 1st hard frosts end mosquito activity for the year. Horse owners in Maine are well advised to vaccinate their animals against EEE virus infections.
