"Red eye" outbreak
------------------
Phuentsholing has been hit by conjunctivitis, commonly called
"red-eye." In one day, around 35 cases were recorded, with a majority
of them being students, followed by adults. According to health
officials, conjunctivitis cases have been reported since May [2010],
with a majority being reported this month [July]. "It's like the peak
season this month," said the eye technician of Phuentsholing
hospital, Jigme Tshewang. "The infection is contagious and spreads
easily from close contact."

Many others are being treated in private clinics in the neighbouring
Indian town of Jaigaon.

Redness, irritation, and watering of the eyes are common to all forms
of conjunctivitis. The skin around the eyes also becomes red and
scaly, said health officials. Although there is no cure for viral
conjunctivitis, symptomatic relief may be achieved with cool
compresses and artificial tears, said health officials, while for
worst cases, topical corticosteroid drops may be prescribed for 5 to
6 days to reduce the discomfort from inflammation.

Since the disease is contagious, patients are often advised by health
officials to avoid touching their eyes or sharing towels. Viral
conjunctivitis usually resolves within a week. However, in worst
cases, it may take over a month, according to health officials. "The
viral or bacterial infection is seasonal and mostly surfaces during
the monsoon season," said Jigme Tshewang. "Little children are more
vulnerable."

Conjunctivitis may be transmitted to the eye by contaminated hands,
washcloths or towels, cosmetics such as eye makeup, improper usage of
contact lenses and close contact with infected people. The
conjunctiva is a clear membrane that is the tough, leathery outer
coat of the eye, with many small blood vessels that lubricate and
protect the eye while it moves in its socket.

[Conjunctivitis can result from many causes, and conjunctivitis is
common in parts of Asia during the monsoon season. The identity of
the infectious agent is unclear from this report. A previous outbreak
in Phuentsholing in 2003 was attributed to bacterial infection (see
reference below).

The primary cause of infection may be viral, with a secondary
bacterial infection which may respond to antibiotic treatment.
Adenovirus type 11, coxsackievirus type A24, and enterovirus type 70
are regularly associated with acute conjunctivitis, and adenoviruses
types 8, 19, and 37 with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.

Viral conjunctivitis is highly contagious. Most viruses that cause
conjunctivitis are spread through direct hand-to-eye contact by hands
that are contaminated with the infectious virus. Hands can become
contaminated by coming in contact with infectious tears, eye
discharge, fecal matter, or respiratory discharges.

In the previous report of the outbreak of conjunctivitis in Bhutan in
2003 Mod.LL wrote the following: "Major causes of bacterial
conjunctivitis in the normal host are_Staphylococcus aureus_,
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, and _Haemophilus
influenzae_. Care most be taken to avoid misdiagnosing cases due to
the gonococcus as well as trachoma chlamydial disease."
