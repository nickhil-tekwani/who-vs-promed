----------------------------------------------------------------------
The School of Veterinary Sciences at Konkuk University is surprisingly close to Konkuk University Hospital, where a number of patients were recently treated for MERS-CoV virus infection. In the following campus map, the Veterinary School and Hospital are denoted by numbers 15 and 30, respectively; and number 12 identifies the Animal Science School (http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Konkut.jpg).

Significantly, a paper published by the school in 2007 suggests that at least some of the veterinary staff have been involved in work with camels. [1]

Have these patients been tested for MERS-CoV infection?

[ProMED-mail thanks Steve Berger for his question regarding testing for MERS-CoV as a cause for the pneumonia outbreak at Konkuk University's school of veterinary science. The initial set of reports from the South Korean Ministry of Health said only that the affected individuals "all have tested negative" for brucellosis, Q fever, and legionella, mycoplasma and chlamydia and viruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS] and influenza, without specifying the methodology (ProMED-mail post Pneumonia, cause unknown - South Korea: (SO) vet students, RFI 20151030.3756621), but subsequent reports specified that "genetic testing [presumably PCR?] and serum antibody tests" were done on "some patients" and were negative for "Merck's [presumably MERS?] and coronavirus" as well as other respiratory viruses.

The specifics of diagnostic laboratory testing would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
