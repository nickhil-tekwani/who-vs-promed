Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has made people in as far away as the UK and North Africa deathly ill. Nevertheless, as the majority of infections and deaths have occurred in Saudi Arabia, many believed that this was the origin of the SARS-like virus. With a more than 50 per cent mortality rate, fears are high that the virus could spread globally during the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia occurring in the next few months. Reseachers have tried to figure out where the virus originated from to understand how to prevent its transmission and prevent any variant from taking hold.

Scientists from the University of Bonn in Germany and researchers in South Africa have found evidence that a virus that is genetically quite close to the MERS-CoV is in the feces of bats. These South African bats harbor a virus that is more genetically similar to the MERS-CoV than any other virus tested. The findings, which were published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, may provide important clues into the true origin of this new virus (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/10/13-0946_article.htm).

The researchers tested 62 South African bats from 13 species for coronaviruses to determine if their feces contained viruses closely related to MERS-CoV. This was possible because the MERS-CoV virus had its genome sequenced early on in research of the disease (http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1317136246479).

Although the related virus was seen in only one bat, the finding is still a compelling one. It is unknown how the virus was originally transmitted to humans, either through bats directly or through an intermediary like livestock, but evidence has shown that the virus can spread from person to person when they are in close quarters.

South African bats may be the source of the new coronavirus that's killed 45 people, mostly in Saudi Arabia, according to a study published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

A virus found in the feces of a bat in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces is more closely related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV, than any other known virus, researchers from the University of Stellenbosch, near Cape Town, and the University of Bonn wrote in the article today [24 Jul 2013].

The finding sheds new light on a pathogen that has infected at least 90 people and killed half of them since September [2012], according to the Geneva-based World Health Organization, but whose origin remains unknown. Africa has been the source of other viruses found in the Middle East, such as Rift Valley fever virus, which caused a severe outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2000, the authors wrote.

More studies of bats and potential intermediate hosts such as camels "are urgently needed to elucidate the emergence of MERS-CoV," the researchers said. "Such studies should focus on the Arabian Peninsula and Africa."

[Subscribers are encouraged to access the referenced letter to the editor in Emerging Infectious Diseases at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/10/13-0946_article.htm. We hereby copy its concluding segment:

"Our results further support the hypothesis that, like human CoV-229E and SARS-CoV, ancestors of MERS-CoV might exist in Old World insectivorous bats belonging to the family Vespertilionidae, to which the genera _Neoromicia_ and _Pipistrellus_ belong. Knowledge of the close relatedness of PML/2011 and MERS-CoV, which contrasts with the more distant relatedness of CoVs in bats from the Americas and Asia, enables speculations of an African origin for bat reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV ancestors. This hypothesis is limited by a global sampling bias, the small sample size, and the single clade 2c betacoronavirus detection in this study. Still, a putative transfer of MERS-CoV ancestors from Africa to the Arabian Peninsula would parallel the transfer of other viruses (for example, the exportation of Rift Valley fever virus from East Africa, which led to a severe outbreak in Saudi Arabia in 2000: Bird BH, Khristova ML, Rollin PE, et al. Complete genome analysis of 33 ecologically and biologically diverse Rift Valley fever virus strains reveals widespread virus movement and low genetic diversity due to recent common ancestry. J Virol. 2007;81:2805-16).

"Studies of Vespertilionidae bats and potential intermediate hosts (for example, carnivores and ungulates, such as camels) are urgently needed to elucidate the emergence of MERS-CoV. Such studies should focus on the Arabian Peninsula and Africa."

Initial research activities addressing bats in Saudi Arabia have been briefly reported in earlier postings; the current findings are encouraging. The suggested studies into the animal reservoir of the novel zoonotic coronavirus, involving potential additional species including domestic animals, deserve to be encouraged for earliest application within the affected region. - Mod.AS
