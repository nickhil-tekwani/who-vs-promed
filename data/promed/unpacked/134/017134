A restaurant in Aurora, Colorado, closed at the request of public health officials [Fri 10 Jun 2016], because of an _E. coli_ outbreak among its customers. Multiple media outlets in the area reported that Pho 75, on S. Havana Street, is part of an investigation into an _E. coli_ O157 outbreak that had 4 confirmed victims as of [Sat 11 Jun 2016].

Alicia Cronquist, foodborne disease program manager with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, told local media that state officials believe there are likely additional victims. 1 of the 4 confirmed victims, a 14-year-old boy who ate at the restaurant 24 May 2016 with his family, had such severe symptoms that hospitalization was required.

The Denver Fox News affiliate interviewed the boy's father. Fox31 Denver reported the man and his wife felt ill a few hours after eating at Pho 75, but their son developed severe symptoms. They took him to the Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children emergency room where he was admitted to the intensive care unit with a suspected severe case of pancreatitis.

"The father said his son finally got his 1st bit of good news from doctors. He had just been cleared to eat his 1st solid food of the month. Doctors also said they expected him to turn the corner," Fox31 Denver reported. "Despite the positive news, he is still days, possibly weeks, away from going home."

Health officials urge anyone who has eaten at the restaurant and developed _E. coli_ infection symptoms to seek medical attention.

Colorado public health officials stressed that the outbreak linked to the Pho 75 restaurant is not related to the ongoing nationwide _E. coli_ outbreak associated with General Mills flour. The 2 outbreaks involve different strains of the pathogen.

The Tri-County Health Department for Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas Counties has jurisdiction over Pho 75 and has noted repeated critical violations in recent years.
