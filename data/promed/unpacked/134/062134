WHO recommends influenza vaccine composition for Northern Hemisphere
2005-2006 influenza season
-----------------------------------------------
[The following statement from WHO contains some supplementary
information to that contained in the report posted as "Influenza
update - Northern Hemisphere 20050210.0459. - Mod.CP]
Each year, the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza
Program convenes meetings to analyze the global data on circulating
influenza virus strains and make recommendations for the vaccine to
be used for the coming influenza season. WHO also provides the
vaccine manufacturing industry with prototype strains for the
seasonal vaccine as well as materials to ensure and validate that
global vaccine standards are met.
This year [2005], more than 10 000 influenza viruses from all
continents were isolated and characterized by the WHO/National
Influenza Centers. These laboratories, which are located in more than
80 countries, form the backbone of the global influenza surveillance
program. Based on that assembled information, WHO today [Fri 10 Feb
2005] published its recommendations on the formulation of the
influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere.
This year's [2005] analysis, which concluded yesterday [Thu 9 Feb
2005], was conducted by members of the WHO Collaborating Centers on
Influenza and has recommended that vaccines to be used in the
2005-2006 season (Northern Hemisphere) should contain the following:
(1) an A/New Caledonia/20/99(H1N1)-like virus;
(2) an A/California/7/2004(H3N2)-like virus (candidate vaccine
viruses are being developed);
(3) a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus (the currently used vaccine
viruses are B/Shanghai/361/2002, B/Jiangsu/10/2003 and
B/Jilin/20/2003).
These recommendations are used by pharmaceutical manufacturers to
update the composition of the influenza vaccines they produce. This
annual adjustment is necessary to match the vaccine with the changing
viruses expected to be circulating during the coming influenza season.
Recommendations for the composition of the vaccine to be used in the
Southern Hemisphere will be made at a meeting in September 2005.
While influenza vaccine coverage has improved significantly in the
last 10 years, the vaccine is not reaching everyone in the high risk
categories. These categories, defined by WHO, include the elderly,
those who are at increased risk because they have other respiratory
or cardiovascular disease, and health care workers. However,
influenza vaccine use in developing countries remains minimal to
nonexistent.
Last year [2004], WHO's Member States set a goal of 60 percent
coverage for those in these high risk groups and 75 percent coverage
by 2010.
Since young children can develop severe disease, some countries have
also started including vaccination of children as part of their
national influenza policy. Vaccinating children may not only reduce
their disease burden, but it may also reduce transmission to the
elderly and others at increased risk.
The current influenza season is now approaching its peak. All elderly
persons or those with a particular risk of influenza should be
vaccinated.
