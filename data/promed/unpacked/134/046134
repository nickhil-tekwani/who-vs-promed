Nitrofen: Results of today's Food Chain Committee
-------------------------------------------------
Brussels: The German authorities presented today a detailed report to
the Standing Committee of the Food Chain on the Nitrofen
contamination of cereals intended for food and feed. The source of
the prohibited pesticide contamination has been clearly identified.
In the light of the information and assurances provided today and the
measures taken so far by Germany, the Committee noted that there was
no need at the moment to take additional measures. Tracing the few
outstanding products is continuing in the Federal Republic.
The state of progress of the investigation will be reviewed at a next
meeting of the Standing Committee of the Food Chain and Animal Health
this Thursday, 13 Jun 2002.

Examination and discussion of the nitrofen contamination of the food chain
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The German authorities presented a detailed report on the case of
contamination with nitrofen of cereals intended for food and feed use
which has occurred in a warehouse located in Malchin (NSP). The main
conclusions are the following:
All available information points to one source of contamination.
Therefore, the present scenario with one source of contamination is
the only one envisaged to date. Nevertheless, wide-ranging enquiries
are still being carried out in Germany.
In the first level of distribution from NSP, 100 percent of the
concerned cereals have been accounted for and the tracing further
down the chain is nearly completed. At the second and third levels of
distribution, 94 percent of the total have been accounted for; they
have been either blocked or are already consumed. The tracing of the
remaining 6 percent is ongoing and is expected to be completed by the
end of the week.
As regards ruminants, scientific experiments report that nitrofen is
degraded in the rumen. Transfer of nitrofen to milk has not been
observed in cows in scientific experiments even at high levels of
exposure.
The German authorities will continue to inform the Member States and
the Commission of their findings through the Rapid Alert System for
Food and Feed (RASFF). This means that further notifications can
still be expected, as tracing and testing are still ongoing.
Therefore, new notifications of positive findings through the RASFF
will not necessarily mean that a new source of contamination has been
found, but that the tracing and testing is functioning.
To this end, German notifications will have to establish the link
with the contaminated chain. This will enable complete information on
follow-up action by the German authorities to be made available.
Member States affected by this incident have made and will continue
to make all efforts to trace any potentially contaminated products
and will inform of their findings through the RASFF.
Nitrofen is an herbicide banned for use in the European Union since 1
Jan 1988 under Directive 79/117/EEC. It is classified as a probable
human carcinogen and probable reproductive toxin due to its
teratogenicity. There is no known threshold for the teratogenic
effect. Germany has therefore emphasised the teratogenicity in its
risk communication which to date has been carried out through press
communications and the web site of the BGVV:

The Committee noted that there was no need for the moment to take
community measures in the light of the information provided at the
meeting and the measures taken so far by Germany.The German
authorities will continue to report, in particular at the next
meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
on 13-14 Jun 2002. The Commission will continue to keep the situation
under constant review.
Following the request of the Committee,the Commission confirmed their
commitment to send an FVO mission to Germany.

[Nitrofen is 2,4-dichlorphenyl-p-nitrophenyl ether. Based upon
experimental animal studies it is expected to be identified as a
human carcinogen. It increases the number of hepatocellular
carcinomas and adenomas in both genders of mice. There are increases
in numbers of hemangiosarcomas of the liver and/or spleen in male
mice and of anaplastic adenocarcinomas of the pancreas in female
rats. There are no data in human beings.
Presently there is no commercial use for Nitrofen. It was previously
used as a contact herbicide for pre- and post-emergence control of
broadleaf weeds and annual grasses on a variety of food and
ornamental crops. It was used by growers of rice, broccoli,
cauliflower, cabbage, brussels sprouts, onions, garlic, and celery
and used in commercial nurseries on rose bushes and chrysanthemums,
but not in private homes and gardens.
Primary routes of exposure are dermal contact, inhalation, and
ingestion. Exposure was usually during the application process.
If all the cereals have been traced then this is commendable. - Mod.TG]
