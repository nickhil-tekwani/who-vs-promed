New cases put H7N9 pace near last year's [2013] peak
----------------------------------------------------
The pace of new H7N9 avian flu cases in China over the past week [10-16 Jan 2014] is rivaling the daily crush of infections that occurred during the 1st peak of activity last spring [2013] after the virus 1st emerged, with reports today [16 Jan 2014] of 7 new illnesses, one of them fatal.

What began as a trickle of reports in October [2013] that signaled H7N9's resurgence in humans, primarily from poultry exposure, has expanded over the past few weeks to several cases reported each day. A total of 31 cases have been confirmed from [10 Jan 2014] through today [16 Jan 2014], a number below but approaching the 38 cases reported during the peak week of disease activity, which began on [8 Apr 2013]. Experts contacted by CIDRAP News say the situation bears close monitoring but differed in their level of expressed concern over the situation.

The spike in activity comes as China enters a heavy travel and shopping period for its Spring Festival season, marked by the Lunar New Year celebration on [31 Jan 2014]. China estimates that its citizens will make about 3.62 billion trips during the 40-day holiday travel rush, according to a report today [16 Jan 2014] from Xinhua, China's state news agency. Against the backdrop in H7N9 activity, Chinese health officials have aired concerns about crowded travel conditions and the chance that people visiting urban areas could carry the virus back to their rural homes.

Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP), citing official mainland sources, said that Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejian provinces have 2 new H7N9 cases each, and Guizhou province has 1. The patients are all adults, ages 20 to 76, and 5 are men. The 6 survivors are hospitalized, 4 of them in critical condition.

All of the provinces have reported several other cases recently, except for Guizhou, which is reporting its 1st H7N9 case, in a 38 year old man who got sick while working in Zhejiang province. News of his illness 1st appeared in media reports on [13 Jan 2014] that said he had a suspected infection, but his H7N9 illness has now been confirmed. Guangdong province's cases involve a 59 year old man from Guanzhou and a 76 year old woman from Foshan, according to the CHP. Fujian province's new case-patients are both from the city of Quanzhou, a 30 year old man, plus a 60 year old man who had a history of poultry contact. Meanwhile, Zhejiang province's patients are a 20 year old woman from Hangzhou and a 58 year old man from Taizhou, located about 171 miles south east of the provincial capital.

The new cases push the H7N9 outbreak total to 188 cases and the number of deaths to 53.

Experts weigh in on H7N9 momentum
---------------------------------
Joseph Bresee, MD, chief of the Epidemiology and Prevention Branch in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Division, said the increasing number of confirmed cases reported from China during the past few weeks bears watching closely. "Fortunately, despite additional cases, Chinese health officials haven't reported changes in the epidemiology of the virus that would indicate an increased capacity for spread between humans," he said.

Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for WHO, said the surge in new cases hasn't changed the agency's risk assessment. He said H7N9 is still a virus that causes sporadic human infections and doesn't appear to transmit well from human to human. "We have only seen a handful of human clusters and only very limited human-to-human spread," he said.

Research studies published over the last few months, designed to help gauge pandemic risk the new virus poses, have found H7N9 currently has limited ability for airborne spread. Hartl said health officials haven't seen H7N9 before in January and February, so they aren't sure what to expect. However, he added that since the months are the peak of flu season and H7N9 is a flu virus, "it would not be surprising -- in fact it would be expected -- that we see an upsurge in cases."

[As of 16 Jan 2014, the pace of appearance of new H7N9 avian flu cases in China during the past week is rivaling the daily number of infections that occurred during the 1st peak of activity last spring (2013) after the virus 1st emerged, with reports on 16 Jan 2014 of 7 new illnesses, one of them fatal. With the approach of the Chinese New Year holiday period, it is likely that the rate of appearance of H7N9 cases will continue to increase. The total number of human cases of avian H7N9 influenza virus infection now stands at 188, of whom 53 subsequently died. Nonetheless, officials at WHO still consider that that the surge in new cases hasn't changed the agency's risk assessment, since the H7N9 virus is still associated with sporadic human infections and doesn't appear to transmit well from human to human. Clusters of infection have been rarely detected. The social turmoil during the Chinese New Year festival period, however, may endanger this conclusion. - Mod.CP
