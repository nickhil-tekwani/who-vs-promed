Valley fever is spreading so quickly through 2 Central California prisons that a medical expert is recommending the state act quickly to stem the outbreak or shut the institutions down. In a sworn declaration to a federal judge in San Francisco, Dr John Galgiani said the situation at the Pleasant Valley and Avenal prisons is a "public health emergency".

Valley fever is a fungal infection that causes flu-like symptoms and can be lethal. The San Francisco Chronicle reports (http://bit.ly/ZRi7sn) that according to Galgiani, 62 California prisoners died from 2006 through January 2013 after coming down with the disease.

His report did not specify how many of those deaths occurred at Pleasant Valley and Avenal. But he said those prisons had by far the highest rates of valley fever.

[Coccidioidomycosis, also known as valley fever, is an infection caused by inhaling airborne spores of either _Coccidioides immitis_, native to California, and _C. posadasii_, found outside California. Spores are 2 to 5 micrometer in diameter and are able to reach terminal bronchioles and alveoli. In animal models of infection, inhalation of as few as 10 spores is sufficient to cause infection. The spores are found in the soil of semiarid areas of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and Texas, as well as similar areas of Central and South America. In the United States, the southern San Joaquin Valley of California and southern Arizona have the highest endemicity. Disease incidence is correlated with rainfall followed by a period of drought.

The spores become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. Documented occupational disease clusters in endemic areas have been noted in those engaged in soil-disrupting activities, such as farming, mining, quarrying, and construction (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/ohb/Documents/OccCocci.pdf). In addition, outbreaks have occurred in anthropologists, archaeologists, and military personnel participating in training exercises in endemic areas. Outbreaks have followed dust storms and earthquakes. For example, 203 cases of coccidioidomycosis were reported in Ventura County, California in 1994 after large dust clouds, generated by landslides following the Northridge earthquake and strong aftershocks in the Santa Susana Mountains, that descended into nearby valleys by north east winds (Schneider E, Hajjeh RA, Spiegel RA, et al. A coccidioidomycosis outbreak following the Northridge, Calif, earthquake. JAMA 1997; 277(11): 904-8; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9062329).

About 60 per cent of infected people are asymptomatic. The commonest clinical presentation is flu-like illness that is sometimes accompanied by shortness of breath, chest pain, arthralgias, erythema nodosum, or erythema multiforme (acute pulmonary coccidioidomycosis), which develops 1-4 weeks after exposure. 95 per cent or more of patients recover without any further sequelae, but the infection rarely may disseminate throughout the body with a predilection for joints and the CNS, especially the meninges. Overall, less than 5 per cent of those infected have progressive pulmonary infection or extrapulmonary dissemination of the disease. Risk factors for more severe pulmonary disease include diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of less than USD 15 000 per year, and older age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229838). Risk factors for dissemination include certain ethic groups (persons of African, Filipino, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent), pregnancy, and immunodeficiency, such as that due to AIDS or by immunosuppressive drugs. Infection generally imparts immunity to reinfection.

Arizona and California are among the states where coccidioidomycosis is reportable. From 1997 to 2007, the incidence rate of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona increased 281 per cent and in California the incidence rate more than tripled (from 2.4 to 8.0 per 100 000 population) from 2000 to 2006 (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/ohb/Documents/OccCocci.pdf ). In contrast to California, the coccidioidal endemic region in Arizona is also the most populous region of the state, and Arizona now accounts for 60 per cent of all cases reported in the United States. Factors accounting for rising disease incidence in California and Arizona include climate change, new construction, and an influx into the endemic region of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic, such as military recruits onto training bases in Southern California. Especially problematic is the influx of those at higher risk of developing symptomatic illness such as elderly people who go to live in Arizona retirement communities, and prisoners from urban ghettos where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (Ampel NM. What's behind the increasing rates of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona and California? Curr Infect Dis Rep. 2010; 12(3): 211-6 DOI 10.1007/s11908-010-0094-3. Abstract available at http://pubget.com/paper/21308532/What_s_Behind_the_Increasing_Rates_of_Coccidioidomycosis_in_Arizona_and_California). Many of the prisoners are likely to be African American men, who represent a disproportionate portion of the California prison population. Prisoners having greater risk for dissemination may account for a large proportion of the 62 California prisoners who died of coccidioidomycosis from 2006 through January 2013.
