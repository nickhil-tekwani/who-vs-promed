[1] South Koreans to go to EU if infected in Sierra Leone

Britain to fly South Korean medical workers to Europe if infected fighting Ebola
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea said on Wed [26 Nov 2014] that Britain had agreed to evacuate for treatment any South Korean medical workers who may be infected with Ebola virus while working at a British-run clinic in Sierra Leone.

Seoul will send a team of 10 medical workers next month [December 2014] to work at the new treatment center in Goderich, outside the capital of Sierra Leone, Freetown where they will join British and American volunteer personnel.

Under an agreement with Britain, an EU-operated plane will fly any infected South Korean medical worker to any of a pool of EU hospitals equipped to treat Ebola for treatment as if the person was a citizen of any EU state, its foreign ministry said.

Australia announced a similar agreement with Britain earlier this month [November 2014] in which London had given assurances that any Australian staff infected with Ebola would be treated as if they were a British citizen. Canberra had raised concerns that any medical staff infected with the disease would not have access to treatment and would face a dangerous 30-hour evacuation flight home.

Germany unveils Ebola evacuation plane in Berlin
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st Airbus refitted to serve as an Ebola evacuation plane has been unveiled in the German capital, Berlin. Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he hopes to see it seldom used...

The machine is nearly 64 meters (210 feet) long, and its passenger seats and the rest of the cabin interior were removed and replaced by a "patient transportation isolation unit."
Inside the specially-built airtight tent, an Ebola patient can be cared for to the same extent as in intensive care at hospital, without pathogens escaping and endangering the rest of the crew. The aircraft can also accommodate up to 19 attendants, including technicians for special equipment, officials and doctors.
Lufthansa said that more than 700 pilots and flight attendants have volunteered to work as crew aboard the Ebola Airbus... - more

[3] Canada: 40 military to treat health-care workers

Canada calls for volunteers to fight Ebola in Africa
------------------------------------------------------------------
Canada is offering 40 military personnel and an additional CAN20.9 million to help fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, while calling for health-care workers willing to "join the fight" against the disease in West Africa.

"Today, I'm issuing a call to action to Canadian health-care workers to travel to West Africa to care for Ebola patients in Ebola treatment centres in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea," Health Minister Rona Ambrose said at a news conference in Ottawa Thu [27 Nov 2014]. Ambrose said the need is for doctors, nurses, psychological and social support workers, water and sanitation engineers and infection prevention and control workers.

Ambrose pledged the government would support Canadians willing to undertake an 8-week commitment in Africa, including maintaining full pay and benefits for federal workers who volunteer. The 8 weeks include one week of training, 4 weeks in the field and 3 weeks recovery, Ambrose said. The government has an evacuation plan in place after recently signing an agreement with 2 commercial companies, she added. "We have resolved the medevac issue. We didn't feel it was responsible for us to be encouraging people to go to West Africa until we felt very comfortable with the medical evacuation options for Canadians. We feel comfortable with that now," Ambrose said in response to reporters' questions.

Military will treat health workers
------------------------------------------
The Department of National Defence will send Canadian Forces health-care and support staff to Sierra Leone for up to 6 months. The Canadian military doctors, nurses and medics will be stationed with personnel from the United Kingdom at the Kerry Town Treatment Unit, treating health-care workers who have been exposed to the deadly virus. Defence Minister Rob Nicholson acknowledged the 40 Canadian Forces personnel will not be treating the general population. "According to the information we have in our discussions, there was a need for [personnel to treat health workers] and we've been in discussion with the British, and so we indicated that we would supply that service," Nicholson told reporters.

The CAN20.9 million will be given to 10 humanitarian organizations:
- For treatment and psychological support
- To help local communities cope with the outbreak
- To train medical personnel and emergency experts who will be deployed to the region.

[4] USA: NYC & Newark airports quiet

Notable absence of new Ebola quarantines at New York area airports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A day after CS, a doctor who had returned from Guinea about a week earlier became the 1st Ebola case in New York, the governors of New York and New Jersey announced that they would begin quarantining travellers who had been in contact with Ebola patients in West Africa. The move, which went beyond federal policy, drew protests from medical aid groups and the Obama administration, which said it would penalize people who were trying to contain Ebola and discourage others from doing so.
But since Kaci Hickox, a nurse, flew into Newark airport on Fri 24 Oct 2014 and was kept at a hospital for 3 days, no one else has been caught up in the quarantine dragnet at the New York and New Jersey airports. The absence of quarantines is striking, not only because both governors emphatically defended the policy as a necessary precaution, but also because most people returning from Ebola-stricken countries arrive in the United States through Kennedy and Newark Liberty International Airports. Several aid organizations have American health care workers in West Africa, a handful of whom return every week. But New York and New Jersey officials say no one coming through the 2 airports since Ms. Hickox has reported direct contact with Ebola patients...

Possible explanations, based on interviews with several doctors who served in West Africa and the organizations they worked with, are that health care workers are delaying their returns to the United States, or they are deliberately avoiding the 2 airports if they have been exposed to Ebola patients in the 21 days before arrival, which could subject them to quarantine. A New York-based doctor with AmeriCares said that he and some colleagues were planning to spend 3 weeks in Europe after their tours, to avoid coming home to a quarantine in the United States. Doctors Without Borders [MSF] workers have sometimes done the same thing, Tim Shenk, a spokesman, said... - more
