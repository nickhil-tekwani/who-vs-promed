Guillain-Barre Syndrome Among Recipients of Menactra Meningococcal Conjugate
Vaccine --- United States, June-July 2005
-----------------------------------------
On 14 Jan 2005, a quadrivalent (A, C, Y, and W135) meningococcal conjugate
vaccine (Meningococcal Polysaccharide Diphtheria Toxoid Conjugate Vaccine,
Menactra [licensed brand name], Sanofi-Pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania)
(MCV4) was licensed in the United States. MCV4 is a tetravalent vaccine; each
0.5-mL dose contains 4 [micrograms] each of capsular polysaccharide from
_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 conjugated to 48
[micrograms] of diphtheria toxoid.
In February 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)
recommended routine vaccination of adolescents at the preadolescent health-
care visit (at ages 11-12 years) (1). For persons who have not been vaccinated
previously, ACIP recommended vaccination before high-school entry (at
approximately age 15 years). Routine vaccination also is indicated for 1st-
year college students living in dormitories and for other persons at increased
risk.*
As of 4 Oct 2005,** the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
received 5 reports of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) in persons after receipt
of MCV4 vaccination. VAERS, operated by CDC and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), is a national passive surveillance system that monitors
the safety of vaccines (2). Health-care providers, state and local health
departments, consumers, and vaccine manufacturers are encouraged to report
adverse events involving all U.S.-licensed vaccines. All 5 persons had been
vaccinated during 10 Jun - 25 Jul 2005. This report describes the clinical and
epidemiologic features of these 5 cases and summarizes preliminary data from
ongoing studies.
Case Reports
------------
See URL above.
Case Summary
------------
All reported GBS cases occurred among persons aged 17-18 years who were
vaccinated during 10 Jun - 25 Jul [2005] and had symptom onset 14-31 days
after MCV4 vaccination. On the basis of information obtained to date, one
patient reported another acute illness before onset of neurologic symptoms.
The 5 patients described in this report received vaccine from 4 different
lots. These cases were reported from Pennsylvania (2), New York, Ohio, and New
Jersey (one case each).
Reported by: Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug
Administration. Immunization Safety Office; National Immunization Program;
National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.
MMWR Editorial Note:
------------------
GBS is a serious neurologic disorder involving inflammatory demyelination of
peripheral nerves (3). It can occur spontaneously or after certain antecedent
events such as infections. Illness is typically characterized by the subacute
onset of progressive, symmetrical weakness in the legs and arms, with loss of
reflexes. Sensory abnormalities, involvement of cranial nerves, and paralysis
of respiratory muscles also can occur. A small proportion of patients die, and
20 percent of hospitalized patients can have prolonged disability.
_Campylobacter jejuni_, which causes bacterial gastroenteritis, especially in
young adults and during the summer months, is one identified precipitating
factor for GBS.
Approximately 2.5 million doses of MCV4 have been distributed nationally since
March 2005 (Sanofi-Pasteur, unpublished data, 2005). The number of exact
vaccine doses administered is unknown. The precise rate of GBS also is
unknown. Data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a collaborative project
between CDC and eight managed care organizations in the United States (4), and
the Health Care Utilization Project on GBS incidence in persons aged 11-19
years indicate a background annual incidence of 1-2 cases per 100 000 person-
years (CDC; Healthcare Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample; Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality, unpublished data, 1989-2001). This
finding suggests that the rate of GBS based on the number of cases reported
within 6 weeks of administration of MCV4 is similar to what might have been
expected to occur by chance alone. However, the timing of the onset of
neurologic symptoms (i.e., within 2-5 weeks of vaccination) is of concern. In
addition, the extent of underreporting of GBS to VAERS is unknown; therefore,
additional cases might be unreported (5,6).
Pre-licensure studies conducted by Sanofi Pasteur of approximately 7000
recipients of MCV4 revealed no GBS cases (7). CDC has conducted a rapid survey
by using available VSD and other health care organization databases. No cases
of GBS have been detected among nearly 110 000 MCV4 recipients represented in
these databases. Data from 2 VSD sites indicated that 86-97 percent of vaccine
recipients had 6 weeks of follow-up via automated data collection. These data
do not rule out an association between MCV4 and GBS.
During 1999-2005, a total of 30 million doses of 3 different meningococcal C
conjugate vaccines (MenC), with either diphtheria CRM (nontoxic variant of
diphtheria toxin) or tetanus toxoid as carrier proteins, have been used in the
United Kingdom (UK) for persons aged less than 18 years. 5 cases of GBS were
reported in the UK after administration of MenC vaccines (UK Department of
Health, unpublished data, 2005). This reported number of cases is lower than
would have been expected to occur by chance in a population this age.
To date, evidence is insufficient to conclude that MCV4 causes GBS. An ongoing
known risk for serious meningococcal disease exists. Therefore, CDC is
recommending continuation of current vaccination strategies. Whether receipt
of MCV4 vaccine might increase the risk for recurrence of GBS is unknown;
avoiding vaccinating persons who are not at high risk for meningococcal
disease and who are known to have experienced GBS previously is prudent.
FDA and CDC are alerting health-care providers to this preliminary information
and are actively investigating the situation because of its potentially
serious nature. The manufacturer has sent letters to health-care providers and
is updating the package insert to reflect that GBS has been reported in
association with the vaccine. CDC recommends that adolescents and their
caregivers be informed of this ongoing investigation as part of the consent
process for vaccination with Menactra.
FDA and CDC are requesting that providers or other persons with knowledge of
possible cases of GBS (or other clinically significant adverse events)
occurring after vaccination with MCV4 report them to VAERS. Reports of GBS
should be submitted to VAERS at <http://www.vaers.hhs.gov> or by telephone at
800-822-7967. CDC further requests that health-care providers report other
cases of GBS that occur among persons aged 11-19 years to state health
departments in accordance with state or local disease-reporting guidelines.
CDC suggests that state health departments consider enhancing surveillance for
GBS in adolescents to assist in answering these critical questions. Cases of
meningococcal disease should be reported to state health departments and, if
available, information on vaccination status should be provided; isolates
should be saved and sent to state health departments for serogroup
identification.

[As discussed in the above report, at present there are no definitive data
either supporting or ruling out an association between receipt of the vaccine
and the occurrence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). It is curious that only
one of the 5 cases described above had a seemingly "clean" medical history
with no prior episodes or illnesses or possible exposures that might
predispose for GBS (one of the cases had a history of 2 prior episodes of GBS
following receipt of other vaccines in early childhood, another had a mother
with a history of GBS, another had a sore throat which may have been due to an
infectious etiology 6 days after receipt of the vaccine, and another was on
multiple psychotropic agents). We await further information on results of
ongoing studies and active surveillance for possible additional cases. -
