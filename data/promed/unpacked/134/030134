Other details/comments:
Suspected cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the State of Parana were
notified on 21 Oct 2005, based on an epidemiological link with an FMD
occurrence in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, caused by the entry of 87
cattle from an establishment in the vicinity of 2 other outbreaks in the
municipality of Eldorado (Mato Grosso do Sul) and subsequently identified
as an FMD outbreak on 5 Dec 2005 (OIE follow-up report no.12
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_41.HTM#Sec6>). These animals entered
the State of Parana on 27 Sep 2005 and stayed for 8 days in a rural
establishment located in the municipality of Bela Vista do Paraiso
(Parana). On 4 Oct 2005, the animals were sent on to Londrina for auction,
and sold on the same day to other rural establishments situated in the
State of Parana. These establishments, in addition to those situated within
the buffer zone around the establishments, were kept under a ban throughout
the investigation. No FMD suspicions have been identified since November 2005.
All the establishments that had received cattle from the auction were
investigated by the Veterinary Service of the State of Parana. After
carrying out clinical and epidemiological inspections and laboratory tests,
11 establishments were identified with suspected vesicular disease: 5 which
had acquired animals from the auction, a further 5 located in geographical
proximity to the latter establishments, and one establishment that had
received animals from the Mato Grosso do Sul outbreak and then sent them to
Londrina for auction (OIE follow-up reports No. 5
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_47.HTM#Sec13>, 7
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_46.HTM#Sec1>, 12
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_41.HTM#Sec6>, and 14
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_36.HTM#Sec1>).
On 5 Dec 2005, after investigations had been conducted in the suspect
establishments, an outbreak was notified in the municipality of Sao
Sebastiao da Amoreira, in an establishment which had received cattle sold
at auction originating from the establishment where an outbreak was
notified in Mato Grosso do Sul, and which presented antibodies to
non-structural proteins (NSP) of the FMD virus (OIE follow-up report No. 12
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_41.HTM#Sec6>). Measures for
slaughtering the existing cattle in that establishment are still in
progress. In January 2006, a supplementary epidemiological investigation
was carried out in the other rural establishments with suspected FMD
occurrence, in collaboration with the Pan American Foot and Mouth Disease
Centre (PANAFTOSA). Serological analyses were carried out to identify NSP
antibodies in 2205 animals, based on rigorous epidemiological and
statistical parameters and OIE-approved techniques developed by PANAFTOSA.
The analyses, conducted in accordance with the regulations of the National
FMD Eradication Programme (PNEFA) and with IE guidelines, resulted in the
confirmation of 6 FMD outbreaks in the suspected establishments situated in
the municipalities which had been under a ban since 21 Oct 2005 (see table
above).
In response to these confirmed outbreaks, the Brazilian Animal Health
Protection Service will continue to apply the necessary measures in line
with OIE guidelines.
Final report: no.
