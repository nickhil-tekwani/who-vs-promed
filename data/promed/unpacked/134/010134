The NPPO of Israel (Plant Protection and Inspection Services)
informed the EPPO Secretariat that the bacterium _Acidovorax avenae_
subsp. _citrulli_, a quarantine pest for Israel, has been found
infecting watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_) and melon (_Cucumis melo_)
at a limited number of production sites. Eradication measures have
been implemented at these sites and national surveillance is ongoing.
The status of _Acidovorax avenae_ subsp. _citrulli_ in Israel is
officially declared as follows: Present, only in some areas, under
eradication.

[Bacterial fruit blotch has great potential to cause significant
economic losses to cucurbit production and has been responsible for
up to 90 percent losses of marketable yield in some watermelon
fields. Although all cucurbits are susceptible, bacterial fruit
blotch is only a problem on watermelon. The fruit symptoms
(irregularly shaped water-soaked lesions with cracks) that are most
obvious and distinctive. Fruit blotch can be introduced in infected
seeds as part of the international seed trade. PCR-based detection
methods in seed are being developed. Use of clean seed and
disease-free transplants is necessary in order to manage the disease.
Because the pathogen is seedborne, and a significant portion of
commercial watermelon fields are planted with seedlings raised in
greenhouses or other transplant production facilities, recognition of
symptoms on seedlings is important. Control in the field involves
rotation out of cucurbits and control of volunteer watermelon plants.
Sprinkler irrigation can lead to spread through the field.
