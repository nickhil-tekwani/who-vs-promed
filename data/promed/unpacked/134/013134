Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Jan 2021
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 9328 / 1485 / 1451 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Small holders farms with a population ranging from 15-300 pigs per farm kept indoors.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Swine / 15.9 / 15.6 / 97.7 / 15.6
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Introduction of new live animals, illegal movement of animals, swill feeding, fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc)

Epidemiological comments: Traders and slaughter men were moving from one farm to the other without adhering to biosecurity measures.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, traceability

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the media report: "The Livestock and Fisheries minister Mashimba Ndaki has on Sat 23 Jan 2021 instructed regional and district commissioners to control movement and transportation of pigs in their areas of jurisdiction in order to control the spread of African swine fever. Mr Ndaki said African swine fever has been reported in 6 lake zone districts, causing alarm that the disease could spread to other districts and severely bring devastation."

The following abstract comes from a scientific article entitled "Persistent domestic circulation of African swine fever virus in Tanzania, 2015-2017", which is available in ref 1:

"Abstract:
"Background: African swine fever (ASF) is a highly fatal viral hemorrhagic disease of domestic pigs that threatens livelihoods and food security. In Africa, ASF virus (ASFV) circulates in sylvatic (transmission between warthogs and soft argasid ticks) and domestic (transmission between domestic pigs) cycles, with outbreaks resulting from ASFV spill-over from the sylvatic cycle. A number of outbreaks were reported in different parts of Tanzania between 2015 and 2017. The present study investigated ASFV transmission patterns through viral DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. A total of 3120 tissue samples were collected from 2396 domestic pigs during outbreaks at different locations in Tanzania between 2015 and 2017. Partial sequencing of the B646L (p72) gene was conducted for diagnostic confirmation and molecular characterization of ASFV. Phylogenetic analysis to study the relatedness of current ASFV with those that caused previous outbreaks in Tanzania and representatives of all known 24 ASFV was performed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood model with 1000 bootstrap replications in MEGA 6.0.

"Results: ASFV was confirmed to cause disease in sampled domestic pigs. ASFV genotypes II, IX, and X were detected from reported outbreaks in 2015-2017. The current ASFV isolates were similar to those recently documented in the previous studies in Tanzania. The similarities of these isolates suggest continuous circulation of ASFV with virus maintenance within the domestic pigs.

"Conclusions: Genetic analysis confirmed the circulation of ASFV genotypes II, IX, and X by partial B646L (p72) gene sequencing. The similarities of current isolates to previously isolated Tanzanian isolates and pattern of disease spread suggest continuous circulation of ASF with virus maintenance in the domestic pigs. Although certain viral genotypes seem to be geographically restricted to certain zones within Tanzania, genotype II seems to expand its geographical range northwards with the likelihood of spreading to other states of the East African Community. The spread of ASFV is due to breach of quarantine and transportation of infected pigs via major highways. Appropriate control measures including zoo-sanitary measures and quarantine enforcement are recommended to prevent ASF domestic circulation in Tanzania."
