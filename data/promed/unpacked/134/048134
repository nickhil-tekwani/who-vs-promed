---------------------------------------------------------------------
All samples collected at the 3 farms located within the surveillance zone of 1 km [0.6 mi] have now been tested by the influenza A (matrix) PCR and an AI antibody blocking ELISA in our institute. Neither virus nor antibodies were detected, which supports the hypothesis that the virus was introduced to the farm in Lochem most likely by contact between wild birds and the free ranging chickens, and that infection did not spread from or to other farms.

The flock on the index farm was immediately culled upon confirmation of the infection and the premises is currently cleaned and disinfected.
