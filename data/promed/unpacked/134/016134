Abstract:
Thus far, no human MERS-CoV infections have been reported from Israel. Evidence for the circulation of MERS-CoV in dromedaries has been reported from almost all the countries of the Middle East, except Israel. Therefore, we aimed to analyze MERS-CoV infection in Israeli camelids, sampled between 2012 and 2017. A total of 411 camels, 102 alpacas and 19 llamas' sera were tested for the presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV. Our findings indicate a lower MERS-CoV seropositivity among Israeli dromedaries than in the surrounding countries, and for the 1st time naturally infected llamas were identified. In addition, nasal swabs of 661 camels, alpacas and lamas, obtained from January 2015 to December 2017, were tested for the presence of MERS-CoV RNA. All nasal swabs were negative, indicating no evidence for MERS-CoV active circulation in these camelids during that time period.

Discussion
----------
We present the 1st serological and molecular survey for MERS-CoV infection among Israeli camelids, from 2012 to 2017. Camels showed an average MERS-CoV seroprevalence of 60.6 percent between 2012-2017 by VNT and an average seroprevalence of 62.9 percent by ELISA between 2015-2017, without any detection of viral RNA in the nasal swabs of the 540 camels. The presence of virus-specific neutralizing antibodies suggests that Israeli camels were exposed to MERS-CoV in the past. The VNT assay was more sensitive and more specific than the ELISA. Whereas the ELISA detects only IgG, the VNT detects any isotype of antibodies which could be IgG, IgM or IgA. The higher strength of the VNT assay as compared to ELISA might be attributed by the fact that borderline sera by ELISA were not considered.

For the period from 2012-2017, the proportion of camel sera with high VNT titers (higher than 320) in Israel was 27.3 percent, which is much lower than the proportion of sera with high VNT titers in the surrounding countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Egypt, and Jordan, reaching to more than 90 percent. Moreover, the proportion of sera with low VNT titers (less than 320) in Israel was about 70.4 percent, whereas in the surrounding countries only about 10 percent of the sera had low VNT titers meaning that the MERS-CoV seroprevalence in Israel is lower than that in the surrounding countries.

The differences in seropositivity by year in Israel might be related to the camels included in the random sample.

In contrast, low (14.3 percent) seroprevalence and probably no virus circulation were documented in the Canary Islands.

In the present study we showed for the 1st time the presence of MERS-CoV antibodies in naturally infected llamas by ELISA and VNT. In our study 29.4 and 31.5 percent of Israeli alpacas and llamas, respectively, were seropositive using the VNT assay. Using ELISA only, 34.3 and 36.8 percent of alpacas and llamas, respectively were detected seropositive. The 2 camels co-housed with the llamas and alpacas were negative for antibodies and viral RNA using the 2 serological assays and PCR, respectively.

Previously, MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies were detected in 15/15 alpacas in Qatar. Similar to our findings, lower neutralizing antibody titers were documented in alpacas and experimentally infected llamas than in camels.

Using a MERS-CoV specific RT-PCR we detected no MERS-CoV genomic RNA in the nasal swabs of camels, alpacas and llamas during the period of 2015 to 2017 providing no evidence for active MERS-CoV circulation.

Conclusions
-----------
Altogether, the relatively low prevalence of antibodies to MERS-CoV, the low antibody titers, the absence of viral RNA in nasal swabs, and the absence of disease in humans, indicate limited MERS-CoV circulation in Israeli camelids during the [timeframe] of our survey".

Israel's camel population is located mainly in the south, namely in the Negev arid region, bordering the Kingdom of Jordan on the east and Sinai (Egypt) on the west. Contacts of Israel's ca 3000-3500 strong camel population with Jordan's camels (reportedly, counting some 11 000 animals), may be uncommon but cannot be regarded as fully excluded. Regional scientific cooperation is desired for the deciphering of MERS enigmatic epidemiology in humans, in particular its apparently higher incidence in humans in Saudi Arabia compared with other Middle East countries with dromedary camel populations.

It deserves to be noted that the 'Egyptian tomb bat' (_Taphozous perforatus_) which was suspected, in 2013, as a reservoir of MERS CoV in Saudi Arabia, is known to be present also in Jordan and Israel, mainly along the (shared by both) Jordan valley. The largest, breeding cave on the Israeli side of the Jordan is situated near Kalia, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea, where 300-500 individuals were reportedly sighted in the spring months of 2013. It will be interesting to note if bats are subject to surveillance in the 2 countries.
