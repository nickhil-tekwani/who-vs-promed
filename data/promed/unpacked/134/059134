According to residents, by Thursday [14 Jul 2022] evening, 60 pigs [had been] found dead in Shyam Vihar, Krishnalok Colony, and Millat Nagar area of Faizullahganj, Ward II [map at https://tinyurl.com/38sxwnxs]. On Friday [15 Jul 2022], 27 more pigs were found dead, and with the death of 10 more on Saturday [16 Jul 2022], the total count reached 97. State health officials rushed to the area to investigate the cause of the mysterious deaths.

"According to our initial investigation on the site, these pigs died in different locations. Three residents keep a significant number of pigs in the neighbourhood. Most of the dead pigs had already been buried by LMC and the owners before we arrived. We discovered 2 dead pigs in different locations," said Dr Ashish Singh, veterinary officer, Government Veterinary Polyclinic Hospital Badshah Bag, Lucknow. Dr Singh said that the samples have been sent to a laboratory in Bhopal for further examination, and the report would be available by next week. "Only then will the exact cause of death be known," he added.

The incident has left people terrified for their safety. "The people living in the neighbourhood fear that they might also catch the disease. Some of the local families have also reported illness and have complained of fever, headaches, and vomiting," said [MPV], a resident of Faizullahganj.

The Lucknow Municipal Corporation demolished pig pens in the Faizullahganj area on Saturday [16 Jul 2022] evening. As per reports, 4 pens were demolished by LMC.

Mamata Tripathi, president of Baal Mahila Sewa Sangathan, Faizullahganj, informed that around 10 000 pigs roam freely in the colonies.

Lucknow Municipal Corporation director of animal welfare Dr AK Rao said, "The bodies of 5 pigs, which were recovered today, have been sent for post-mortem, and the report is awaited. The samples of viscera have also been sent to the lab for further study of the reasons behind the death. The doctors of the animal husbandry department are keeping a close watch on the remaining pigs in Faizullahganj, whereas LMC cleaned the area where the dead pigs were found."

[Results of the lab examinations, addressing infectious as well as non-infectious agents, are anticipated soon. These should include African swine fever (ASF) virus, which has been spreading in northern India since May 2021. The suspected connection between pig mortality and human disease, as hinted by a resident, deserves to be addressed. ASF is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
