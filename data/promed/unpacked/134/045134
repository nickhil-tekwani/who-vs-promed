----------------------------------------
In this article, the authors mention that canine influenza has been
around for 40 years. I believe they are actually referring to canine
parainfluenza, which is a paramyxovirus, 1st isolated in 1967.

Reference: Bunn LN, Eddy, A, Lazare, C, Helms J, and Murnane T,
(1967). Viruses recovered from laboratory dogs with respiratory
disease. Proc Soc Exp Biol Med 126:14, 0-145.

[Dogs live their lives in varying extents of contact with horses,
humans and sheep and are likely occasionally to become infected with
the respiratory viruses of their companions. Although parainfluenza
viruses appear to be the most frequent viral component of the kennel
cough syndrome, it seems likely that on occasion dogs will have been
infected with equine or human influenza viruses. The most recent of
such exposures is exemplified by the isolation of a novel species of
pneumovirus from dogs with respiratory illness at 2 dog shelters in
the northeastern USA, viruses which previously had been detected only
in mice (and perhaps enigmatically in humans); RW Renshaw et al.
(Emerg. Infect. Dis. 16 16 (6): 993-995, 2011). - Mod.CP]

[Both viruses have been recognized since the 1960s. Canine
Parainfluenza Virus has been associated for a substantial amount of
time with the causal pathway for Kennel Cough (Infectious
Tracheobronchitis) in dogs, as Dr. Halpin points out. Similarly,the
H3N8 virus causing canine influenza has been around a long time but
just not in dogs.

The emergence of true influenza in dogs in Florida (greyhounds)
jumping from a equine influenza H3N8 virus first reported in 2004 was
a significant event - see Equine influenza, canines - USA (FL) 20040801.2099. The H3N8 virus which jumped from horses to dogs was
originally identified as a cause of Equine Influenza in the 1960s and
circulated in horse population until jumping over to dogs in the late
1990s or early 2000s. This first occurrence of H3N8 in dogs
remained at the level of "viral chatter" in the emergence pathways
early in the decade until becoming gradually more widespread, first
with outbreaks in Florida and other states and now appearing in 35
states. Some recent outbreaks have occurred and are of some increasing
concern - see Influenza, canine - USA (02): (TX) 20110928.2931.

Kennel Cough and Canine Influenza are not easily distinguished
clinically and often result from environments which have a lot of dog
traffic and turnover. We should carefully consider doing more
surveillance for influenza, parainfluenza and maybe even other other
respiratory viruses such as pneumonoviruses in environments where
many
dogs congregate whether they be shelters, kennels or "doggie daycares"
as these environments have a history for being a place where
respiratory diseases such as kennel cough caused by parainfluenza
virus and the recent, fully emerged canine influenza H3N8 can
circulate. - Mod PC]
