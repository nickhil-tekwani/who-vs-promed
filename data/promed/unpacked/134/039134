[The 2 outbreaks, adjacent to each other, in west Mongolia close to China's border (see map at the source URL above) are located within 25-50 km [15.5-31 mi] from the Russian border and from East Kazakhstan, respectively.

China's territories are known to be infected since early 2013, by an FMD virus strain of serotype A, topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Sea-97. The same strain has been reported from Russia, initially on China's border, later spreading to south-western Russia.

3 FMD serotype A outbreaks have been reported in May-June 2013 from East Kazakhstan, most probably, caused by the same topotype.

Serotyping and genotyping of the FMDV strain in west Mongolia are anticipated soon. - Mod.AS
