Further molecular evidence of the non-transmission of plum pox potyvirus
through seeds
--------------------------
Plum pox potyvirus (PPV - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) is naturally transmitted
in orchards by several aphid species, and is also spread by... infected
propagating material. The possibility of seed transmission [is still
debated. In the past, there have been some records of seed transmission in
apricot from Hungary, and in plum and peach from Romania [but these results
could not be confirmed.
Further studies using serological tests [showed that ... [PPV was present
in seed coats and cotyledons (including embryonic tissues) in seeds ...
from infected apricot, plum, and peach trees, but never in seedlings
obtained from infected seeds.
The question of seed transmission of PPV was [readdressed using
serological and molecular techniques. In all, 12 different apricot and 6
peach cultivars naturally infected by PPV strains D and M, respectively,
were used.
All plants tested positive in immunocapture-reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the strains (PPV-D and PPV-M) were
characterized by several molecular and serological assays. The presence of
PPV was studied in ripe seeds collected from these naturally infected
plants, in germinating seeds, and in seedlings. Seedlings were maintained
in aphid-proof conditions for over 3 years (apricot) or over 6 months
(peach) and regularly tested.
ELISA and immunocapture-RT-PCR showed that [a high percentage of ripe seeds
were infected with either strain and that the virus was mainly present in
[the seed coat, although cotyledons were also infected. Analysis during
germination showed that the virus remained confined to reserve tissues and
did not replicate in the meristem.
Apricot and peach seedlings never showed symptoms and, when tested by
molecular assays, always gave negative results. The authors concluded that
PPV-D and PPV-M are not transmitted by apricot and peach seeds.

[By using the more sensitive immunocapture-RT-PCR technique coupled with
serological assays, the authors confirmed that neither strain of PPV was
transmitted by seed. These results are of significance to the tree fruit
nursery trade because seeds, which may or may not be virus-infected, are
often used to generate seedlings to be used as root stocks, upon which
desired scions will be grafted for fruit production. - Mod.DH
