State health officials are investigating after 5 people, including a Kent County resident, were infected with _E. coli_ O157, a potentially deadly strain of bacteria. Undercooked hamburgers, eaten at several different restaurants, are likely the source of the foodborne illnesses, according to a preliminary investigation by the Michigan Department of Community Health. Laboratory results suggest the illnesses are linked to a common source.

The Kent County resident who became ill was hospitalized but is now recovering, said Lisa LaPlante, Kent County Health Department spokeswoman. There have been no deaths linked to the cluster of illnesses. The 5 people who became sick were 20 to 41 years old, state health officials said.

"_E. coli_ O157 illnesses can be very serious or life-threatening, especially for young children, older adults, and people who are immunocompromised," said Dr. Matthew Davis, chief medical executive at the MDCH. "Whether you cook at home or order in a restaurant, ground meats, including ground beef, should always be cooked thoroughly to the proper temperature."

Health departments in Livingston, Oakland, Ottawa, and Washtenaw counties are helping with the investigation.

Most people recover in 5 to 7 days. But those who are vulnerable are at risk of developing hemolytic uremic syndrome, a life-threatening illness. None of those infected in the recent cluster of illnesses have developed that complication.

[Uncooked ground beef, in the form of hamburgers, was the vehicle in the original outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 described in the USA more than 30 years ago. That the sources of the ground beef were restaurants and the strains were genetically related strongly suggests that there is much more of the tainted product out there. Readers should remember that even if the meat is adequately cooked, contamination can still occur if subsequently contaminated in the kitchen. Alternatively, since hamburgers are usually served with lettuce and tomato, the condiments for the hamburger could be a vehicle. - Mod.LL
