[1] WHO countering Ebola myths
Date: April 2014

Busting the myths about Ebola is crucial to stop the transmission of the virus disease in Guinea
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will eating raw onions once a day for 3 days protect me from Ebola? Is it safe to eat mangoes? Is it true that a daily intake of condensed milk can prevent infection with Ebola? These are just some of the questions posed to the health workers responding round the clock to calls received through the free Ebola hotline. With so many Ebola deaths to date, fear has allowed the spread of rumours and misinformation.

The Ministry of Health of Guinea set up Hotline 115 when it announced the country's Ebola outbreak on 21 Mar [2014]. Its main goal is to respond to people's concerns and to be able to quickly refer suspect cases to the isolation ward at Donka hospital in Conakry for further investigation. It currently receives between 200 and 300 calls per day.

"Some of the people who call the hotline are in panic and false rumours make it difficult to calm them down," says Dr Saran Tata Camara, one of the doctors who takes the calls. "But if we tell them that it is not easy to contract Ebola and that they can protect themselves if they respect some rules, they often understand."

Prevention facts
----------------
To prevent the transmission of Ebola virus disease from one person to another it is necessary to take the following precautions:
- Do not touch sick people who show symptoms of Ebola, including, for example, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, headaches and sometimes heavy bleeding.
- Do not touch the dead bodies of suspected or confirmed Ebola patients.
- Wash your hands with water and soap regularly.

A month after the government announced the outbreak, the need for information remains high. To disseminate the messages more rapidly and reinforce their content, WHO and its partners have been engaging religious leaders, tribal leaders, traditional healers and community leaders to help with the outreach. "It was particularly important to start a dialogue with the traditional healers early as some patients prefer to see them instead of consulting the staff at a nearby health centre," says Julienne Anoko, an anthropologist from Cameroon who has been hired by WHO to help with the response to the outbreak. "As they see and touch many people with different symptoms, they are at high risk. They need to know how they and their patients can protect themselves and that quack cures can put lives in danger."

Risky rumours
-------------
Rumours can be very harmful. Recently, a team of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) had to temporarily stop work at the isolation ward in Macenta in Guinee Forestiere, because the medical staff were falsely accused of having brought the virus to the country.

Accurate and timely information helps people to take precautions and take a more rational approach towards the disease. It ensures that people who fall sick with the typical Ebola symptoms are quickly brought to the hospital for testing and care and that families do not hide their sick family members. The Ministry of Health, WHO and its partners know that they will only win the fight against Ebola, if they also win the fight against myths and misconceptions.

West Africa - Ebola virus disease update
Travel and transport risk assessment: Recommendations for public health authorities and transport sector
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Template message for travellers and EVD
------------------------------
- Ebola virus disease is rare.
- Infection is by contact with blood or body fluids of an infected person or an animal infected or by contact with contaminated objects.
- Symptoms include fever, weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and in some cases, bleeding.
- Cases of Ebola have recently been confirmed in Guinea and Liberia.
- Persons who come into direct contact with body fluids of an infected person or animal are at risk.
- There is no licensed vaccine.
- Practice careful hygiene.
- Avoid all contact with blood and body fluids of infected people or animals.
- Do not handle items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids.
- If you stayed in the areas where Ebola cases have been recently reported, seek medical attention if you feel sick (fever, headache, achiness, sore throat, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pain, rash, or red eyes).

[3] Appeals for aid
[As of 23 Apr 2014, international donors recognize that combating the outbreak will need ongoing support for some time yet. Media reports that the outbreak is coming under control are premature. - Mod.JW]

[4] MSF approach to control
Date: Mon 24 Mar 2014

How does MSF respond to Ebola epidemics, given that there is no treatment?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although there is no cure for this disease, we can reduce its very high mortality by addressing the symptoms. This includes administering a drip to patients who have become dehydrated from diarrhoea and by confirming that they do not have a different disease, such as malaria or a bacterial infection like typhoid. Vitamins and anti-pain medication can also be useful. When the person loses consciousness and bleeds copiously, there is no hope. At that point, we ease the patient's pain and stay with him until the end.

In recent years, MSF has been involved in battling every Ebola epidemic. Once the 1st case is confirmed by a blood test, every person who cares for an infected patient must wear a hazmat suit, gloves, a mask and protective goggles and exercise extreme caution when administering treatment. Decontamination chambers are generally installed between the isolated patients and the external environment. To confine the epidemic, it is critical to trace the entire transmission chain. All individuals who have had contact with patients who may be contaminated are monitored and isolated at the 1st sign of infection. The affected communities must also be informed about the illness and the precautions to be taken to limit risks of contamination. Basic hygiene -- such as washing one's hands -- can significantly reduce the risk of transmission.
