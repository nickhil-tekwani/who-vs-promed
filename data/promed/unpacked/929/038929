Potomac horse fever found in Indiana
------------------------------------
The bacterial disease, Potomac horse fever (PHF), which normally doesn't show up until July or August, was diagnosed in a horse in Indiana in mid-June, which could mean more cases of the disease this summer.

Janice Kritchevsky, professor of large animal internal medicine at Purdue says horses need to be diagnosed quickly, adding that early treatment increases the likelihood of survival.

Insects such as freshwater snails, caddisflies, mayflies, and dragonflies are common carries of the bacterium which causes the disease. When they die and litter the ground or fall into feed or water, horses contract the disease by eating the contaminated hay, grain, or pasture, or by drinking contaminated water.

Clinical signs include colitis, dehydration, and diarrhea. Left untreated PHF can lead to shock, permanent lameness, or death. The diseas is not contagious.

The veterinarians in Purdue's Large Animal Internal Medicine Department are specialists in Potomac Horse Fever and other equine infectious diseases. Horse owners or veterinarians who have questions can call the hospital at 765-494-8548.

[This disease has been referred to in the past as equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, or equine ehrlichial colitis. It is best known for its gastrointestinal signs such as enteritis and diarrhea. This disease is caused by _Neorickettsia risticii_, an intracellular organism, which is a member of the Erlichiaea family.

According to the isolates obtained from clinical cases, there is diversity in the organism and each isolate has a different pattern of antigenic proteins. Therefore, Potomac horse fever (PHF) is caused by more than 1 strain of _Neorickettsia risticci_.

_N. risticii_, _N. sennetsu_, SF agent, and _N. helminthoeca_ are antigenically cross-reactive, and inoculation with _N. sennetsu_ protects horses from Potomac horse fever (15,21). However, other than approximate molecular sizes, the nature of these cross-reacting antigens is unknown. A 51-kDa protein (P51) is the major antigen recognized in horses with Potomac horse fever (19). P51 is encoded by the p51 gene, which is not found in any other bacteria based on a search of the GenBank database, and has been found in all _N. risticii_ strains identified to date (2,5,9,11). P51 is predicted to be an outer membrane protein by PSORT analysis (http://psort.nibb.ac.jp/). Therefore, p51 may be a diagnostically important gene for _N. risticii_. However, several critical issues have never been addressed. These include the following: (i) whether the p51 gene exists in other __Neorickettsia_ species, (ii) whether the P51 protein is expressed by the organisms isolated from cultures that can be used as diagnostic antigens, and (iii) whether P51 is antigenically cross-reactive among _Neorickettsia_ spp.

Current vaccines are only made using one strain, which likely explains its lack of efficacy in some cases.

Cases of Potomac horse fever have a seasonal presentation with the highest number of cases with clinical signs in July, August, and September.

Several studies have been conducted to determine the route of infection and have revealed that a parasite, living in freshwater snails and aquatic insects, is a reservoir for _N. risticii_. The parasites and _N. risticii_ have been found in adult and immature forms of aquatic insects, such as caddisflies, mayflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies. Therefore, the seasonality of PHF is likely related to the seasonality of the flying insect.

But how does an equid become infected? These types of insects do not feed on warm blooded mammals, so it is likely that an equid may ingest an aquatic insect or snail while grazing, or consume a flying insect that has landed in drinking water. It has also been suggested that the insects might be attracted to the barn area by outdoor lights during the night.

The typical clinical signs observed in horses with PHF include: fever, anorexia, colic, depression, ileus (nonmotile gastrointestinal tract -- the horse does not defecate) or diarrhea, and laminitis [inflammation of the hoof. - Mod.SH].

Clinical signs and severity vary, but common to all cases of PHF is the manifestation of colitis. The onset of colitis can result in depression and anorexia, and may or may not be accompanied by a fever and/or diarrhea. However, some horses with PHF can pass normal-looking feces without showing any signs of colitis.

The first prominent sign of PHF often observed by owners is a decrease in feed intake. In fact, some horses may not initially show any other clinical signs except not eating. Usually this anorexia is followed by dehydration and toxemia characterized by very bright looking mucous and a bright red/purple line on the mucosal surface above the teeth (toxic line).

Many equids, upon becoming infected with PHF will develop a fever with an initial rise in temperature of about 103-106 degrees F [39-41 degrees C], but the presence of this fever may go unnoticed as this initial fever resolves within hours. However, it is often followed by 3-7 days of persistent fever, along with other clinical signs.

Laminitis often develops in cases of severe endotoxemia, but in some occasions it can be the only clinical sign. Laminitis in most cases results in euthanasia of the equid within days of the onset.

_N. risticii_ can cause abortions, and it is related to placentitis and retained placenta in most cases. The aborted fetus will show signs of the infection as well.

The drug of choice to treat _N. risticii_ infection in equids is oxytetracycline. The organism is inside the cells and is therefore difficult to treat. Oxytetracycline is able to interfere with the control mechanisms of _N. risticii_ and allows the macrophage to eliminate the organism. Oxyetracycline should be administered by a licensed veterinarian once a day for 3 to 5 days, and it is most effective when given in the early stage of the disease.

Several vaccines are commercially available in the United States, but their efficacy is questionable. Research has shown that once an equid develops an infection with _N. risticii_, the equid can develop an immunity to that particular strain for as long as 20 months.

In contrast, vaccination has been associated with a poor immune response. Research has shown that only 50 per cent of the vaccines are protective at 6 months after vaccination, and protection decreases to 33 per cent after 9 months. Vaccination may decrease clinical signs but it will not prevent infection and illness.
