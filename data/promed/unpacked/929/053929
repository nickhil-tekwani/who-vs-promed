Each year, ProMED-mail presents an award in honor of the anniversary of its founding in August 1994. This year [2015], we are pleased to present the 2015 ProMED-mail Awards for Excellence in Outbreak Reporting on the Internet to some of the individuals who have provided critical efforts for ProMED and its members.

[1] Volunteer translators and rapporteurs during the Korean MERS outbreak

We are very grateful to a group of individuals who helped us gather and translate early reports, many of which were available only in the Korean language, on the outbreak of MERS that occurred there beginning in May 2015. One senior US CDC official commented to me that ProMED was often the earliest and most up-to-date source of reliable information during the outbreak. ProMED, and the global public health community, owe a debt of gratitude to these volunteers.

[2] Joseph Wamala, ProMED-EAFR (Anglophone Africa) Moderator

We are pleased to announce this award to Joseph Francis Wamala, ProMED-EAFR (Anglophone Africa) Moderator [Mod.JFW], with the Ministry of Health, Kampala, Uganda. He has been a ProMED moderator since March 2009 and has posted more than 1400 outbreak reports -- an average of 200 a year -- from the media and personal experience of interest to ProMED subscribers concerned with outbreaks in English-speaking Africa. He was recently assigned by WHO to work in a refugee camp in South Sudan, where he has had to wear a bullet-proof vest and was evacuated more than once because of the civil war. Throughout this stressful period, he continued to report faithfully. His work for ProMED in these difficult circumstances deserves the highest praise, of which this award is a small token of appreciation.
