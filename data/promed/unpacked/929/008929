Unknown disease killing Kinneret fish
-------------------------------------
The 1st stage of a mysterious disease affecting Kinneret [Sea of
Galilee] fish begins in one of its eyes, which starts to pop out, and
gets destroyed leaving an empty hole in the socket. Then the 2nd eye
is affected. In the 3rd stage, the blind fish blacken and starves. Red
spots appear on its body and then it dies. So far, there is no
official answer whether the disease is an unknown virus, or a mutation
of a virus, a bacteria or a parasite.

Initial signs of the problem were discovered 10 years ago in small
numbers. The phenomenon was 1st noticed by Menachem Lev, a fisherman
from Kibbutz Ein Gev, a local expert on everything that happens in the
Kinneret. The plague 1st affected St. Peter's Fish [Tilapia,
_Sarotherodon galilaeus galilaeus_], which is considered sacred by
Christians (from the story of the bread and the fishes). About a
million Christian pilgrims visit Israel every year. Most of them visit
the Kinneret and eat St. Peter's fish; the Ein Gev restaurant alone
serves more than 300 000 fish dinners to pilgrims every year.

The problem has worsened since then, and it is not only St. Peter's
Fish that are affected by the disease, but also the Jordan River
tilapia raised in fish ponds in the Hula Valley, silver carp, carp,
and mullet. 12-15 percent of the fish in the lake have already
contracted the disease.

The Ministry of Agriculture denies the presence of this serious
disease in the Kinneret. However, as a result of the numerous
occurrences, a number of tests have been conducted in the last few
weeks to identify the problem. The ministry's Fish Division laboratory
at Nir David has concluded that the cause is not bacteriological. Its
preliminary report in September 2011 found the characteristic symptoms
in fishes' eyes. If the problem is a parasite, this will cause a major
kashrut [approval as "Kosher" according to Jewish ritual-religious
guidelines] problem and the Rabbinate is liable to ban fish from the
Kinneret. The Water Authority believes that the disease is genetic in
origin.

Ministry of Agriculture Veterinary Services fish health director Dr.
Avi Eldar is trying to discover whether a new or mutated virus is the
cause of the disease. The Veterinary Services has not found an
unambiguous answer, and Dr. Eldar has contacted a lab in Italy, which
has not yet given its answer.

In the absence of information about the source of the plague, or
whether eating infected fish risks human health, Prof. Moshe Gefen, a
leading researcher of Kinneret fishes, warned about the problem 5
years ago. He now advises intensive fishing of the lake in order to
remove as many infected fish as possible, test the water of all Hula
Valley fish ponds whose water flows into the Kinneret, and intensify
the investigation into the disease. Most of all, he advises
determining whether the cause is viral, because if it is, it is a
potential human health hazard. He also advises improving the genetic
diversity of the fish in the Kinneret.

The quantity of fish caught in the Kinneret has plummeted in the past
decade from 1800 tons a year to 400 tons. The average wholesale value
of the catch is NIS 25 000 [USD 6942] per ton.

Tilapia mortality in Lake Kinneret
----------------------------------
Background

1. In recent years there has been a trend of decline in the quantities
of tilapia caught in Lake Kinneret.
2. The phenomenon is related exclusively to the tilapia family of
fish, not to other species.
3. The explanations offered: overfishing, predation by cormorants,
poisoning, disease, malnutrition.
4. Attempt to repopulate the lake by a large amount of fry failed to
improve the fish quantities.

Findings to date

1. In 3 out of 4 samplings at different occasions during the months
July to September, fish with cloudy eyes were indeed encountered.

2. The number of caught fish suspected as sick was about 15-20 fish
out of hundreds. This relatively low rate does not indicate low
importance of the phenomenon since the time required from the fish to
achieve commercial size/weight is about one and a half years; hence
daily mortalities of just one-thousandth of one percent (and this due
to just one single disease) may mean a cumulative waste of 50
percent.

3. Laboratory findings (Veterinary Institute and Ministerial Fishery
Department):

A. Bacteriological tests: no growth of bacteria in aerobic or
microaerophilic conditions.

B. Bacteriological tests on genetic level: no evidence of bacteria.

C. Parasitology. Direct observation: No direct evidence of parasites
present. Similarly, no genetic evidence of protozoal involvement.

D. Virology. No evidence for the presence of known viruses, using a
variety of methods.

Histology:

A. Histological examinations revealed multiple focal changes which may
be indicative of non-specific "general stress" which may be due to an
underlying chronic disease. These findings are not specific.

B. No internal parasites nor bacteria colonies were seen.

C. In the kidneys of some fish, a non-diffuse renal inflammation was
recorded. This finding could not be attributed to a known disease
entity.

Tests to date indicate that this phenomenon is unknown to us and not
described in the literature and in international publications.

4. Other laboratories.

A. Kinneret Lake Laboratory: Investigations led to the finding that
the decline in the tilapia population, was accompanied by a decrease
in the quantity of Pridinium [freshwater dinoflagellates ] which is an
important component of the tilapia menu during several months a year.
A fact that raised the possibility of a disease due to nutritional
deficiency.

B. Consultation was undertaken with the National Institute of
Oceanography, Haifa. Results did not deviate from the above.

C. Samples have been sent to 2 laboratories abroad. One of them
already provided negative results; the outcome from the other lab has
not yet been received.

Current state of activities:

- The main focus of present efforts is aimed at the isolation of a
viral agent, including the development of methods for this objective.

- Additional samples will be sent to labs abroad in the near future.

[A brief literature search for 'blindness in fish' has brought up the
following reference:

Jeffrey K. McCrary, Brian R. Murphy, Jay R. Stauffer Jr. & Sherman S.
Hendrix (2007). Tilapia (Teleostei: Cichlidae) status in Nicaraguan
natural waters. Environ Biol Fish (2007) 78:107Â­114.

Extracts:
"We suggest that introduced tilapias may have been responsible for the
outbreak of blindness in native cichlids."

"We suggest here that the outbreak of blindness among native cichlids
in Lake Apoyo [Nicaragua] is caused by trematode infection. The
trematode issue in Lake Apoyo currently is under further
investigation. Several small metacercarial cysts of trematodes were
found in the soft connective tissue at the posterior of the eyeballs
in the blind fishes examined from Lake Apoyo."

Information on the results of the above mentioned further
investigations in Nicaragua will be appreciated.

There is another reference addressing blindness in fish, similarly
from the parasitology realm, but it seems less relevant (Ilan
Paperna. Diseases caused by parasites in the aquaculture of warm water
fish. Annual Rev. of Fish Diseases, 1991, pp. 155-194).

It is encouraging to note that the Ministry of Agriculture is
currently investing considerable efforts in the handling of the issue;
we await the results of the ongoing diagnostic activities undertaken
in Israeli labs and abroad with great interest. The exclusion of
potential public health hazards deserves priority.
