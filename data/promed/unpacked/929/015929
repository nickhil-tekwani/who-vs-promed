It is feared an outbreak of Wheat streak mosaic virus has struck wheat
crops across a wide area of southern and central New South Wales. The virus
has been confirmed in some crops and the New South Wales Department of
Primary Industries is waiting on other test results. It is believed to be
the state's biggest outbreak since the virus was first detected in
Australia in 2003.
According to the department's Paul Parker, early sown grazing wheat on the
slopes country is most affected. In severe cases there is plant stunting
and yellowing of the crop along with poor growth or recovery after grazing
of these crops. Parker says that one of the crop fields he looked at had at
least 60 to 70 per cent yield loss.

[It is not surprising that Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) has reappeared
in Australia, since it is well established in a number of wild, infected
grasses. WSMV infects most or all varieties of wheat (_Triticum aestivum_),
oats (_Avena sativa_), barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), and rye (_Secale
cereale_), and some varieties of maize (_Zea mays_) and millets (_Panicum_,
_Setaria_, and _Echinochloa_ spp.). WSMV appears to have been present in
Australia for several years. Spread of WSMV is related to the dispersal of
the mite vector (_Aceria tosichella_) which is wingless, so their movement
through the air is totally dependent on wind speed and direction. While
mites can be carried several miles by winds, severe infestations generally
develop only within 1/4 to 1/2 mile of the source field.
Wheat streak mosaic disease is managed, where it is significant, by
controlling over-seasoning hosts (particularly volunteer cereals) and to a
lesser extent by managing the wheat curl mite. Delaying sowing may also
assist in providing a host-free period for the virus and mite. Varietal
resistance may also be a tool in WSMV control in the long term and if
warranted. The strategy in North America is to remove the over-summering
green bridge, currently the only way to control the mites and the virus.
WSMV requires a living host plant or a living wheat curl mite to survive.
Management of WSMV should include controlling volunteer winter cereal
plants during the fallow and in summer crops; spraying out or cultivating
out green summer crop stubble and grass weed hosts at least 2 weeks prior
to planting the next wheat crop; controlling grasses in fallow; and
controlling grassy weeds growing on crop borders. Spraying with pesticides
does not effectively control the mites. Varietal resistance to WSMV or the
mites in Australian varieties is currently unknown.
