Army won't force vaccinations on soldiers
The Pentagon amends policy requiring all 2.4 million active-duty service
members to have anthrax shots
***********
Army officials have changed their minds: They have decided they will not
use force to give shots to soldiers who refuse their anthrax vaccinations.
"The Army is amending its policy. We're not going to do forcible
vaccinations," Army spokesman Capt. Scott Bertinetti said. "We're not going
to strap anybody down."
The Pentagon is proceeding with plans to vaccinate all 2.4 million
active-duty, National Guard and reserve service members against anthrax.
Anthrax, a livestock disease, is considered relatively easy to turn into a
biological weapon and is virtually 100 percent fatal in the inhaled form
most likely to be used as a weapon.
Military leaders say the vaccine is the best protection against anthrax.
But federal regulators have repeatedly reported problems at the only plant
that makes the vaccine, and opponents question its safety and effectiveness.
At least 14 sailors and two airmen have been disciplined for refusing the
vaccine earlier this year. And Army Pfc. Mathew Baker, 20, went absent
without leave from Fort Stewart, Ga., on June 9.
At an Aug. 4 press conference, Baker said he went AWOL after getting his
first anthrax shot. He said he only accepted the shot after his company's
first sergeant threatened to strap him down and inject him if he refused.
Army officials defended the first sergeant and said that right is contained
in Army Regulation 600-20, "Army Command Policy," which sets forth the
responsibilities of those in command of troops.
In a section titled, "Medical care with or without the soldier's
permission," the regulation states:
"The policy of authorizing forcible immunization is intended to protect the
health and overall effectiveness of the command as well as the health of
the soldier. Soldiers do not have the option as to whether they will be
immunized except as prescribed" in a separate regulation. The exemptions
include pregnancy, other medical conditions or religious objections.
As recently as last week, soldiers in California and Korea said that
commanders were citing the regulation and threatening to forcibly vaccinate
anyone who refused.
"The regulation is still out there -- it has not been rescinded yet,"
Bertinetti said. "The Army is developing a policy on vaccinations,
specifically anthrax. Soldiers will face disciplinary action if they
refuse."
Baker, who turned himself into the Army on Aug. 5, was released to his
parents' home in Springfield, Ohio. He is pending discharge.
The Navy last week gave general discharges to two sailors who refused to
take the shots. Six others are in a holding status in Japan, pending
discharge.
