The 5th employee of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts
University who was accidentally exposed to a toxin that causes botulism has
been released from the hospital, school officials said yesterday, 7 Apr 2006.
All 5 employees, who were in a lab Wed, 5 Apr 2006 when a tabletop
centrifuge malfunctioned and broke a tube containing a milligram of
botulinum toxin, have been released from UMass Memorial Medical Center,
University Campus, Worcester. 4 of the employees were released late that
night; the 5th was kept overnight for observation. The school did not
identify the employees.
According to a statement released yesterday, 7 Apr 2006, by the school,
none of the 5 employees experienced any symptoms related to possible
botulinum exposure. The laboratory is back to normal operations, and
employee training will be reinforced, the school said. School officials
said there was never a spill or release of the toxin beyond the centrifuge,
and there was never any risk to the public.
According to the FDA, botulinum toxin can paralyze and kill if consumed in
food, but is also safely used, in a purified form, as a medicine to control
certain involuntary muscle contractions. It is also commonly known for its
cosmetic uses under the brand name Botox. The school was using the
botulinum toxin to study food-borne and waterborne diseases under a
contract with the NIH.

[What kind of exposure actually occurred here is not stated, but no
symptoms were manifest in these laboratorians. In the Working Group on
Civilian Biodefense's review on botulinum toxin as a biological weapon (1),
the following is stated (with the citations removed):
"A 4th, man-made form that results from aerosolized botulinum toxin is
inhalational botulism. This mode of transmission has been demonstrated
experimentally in primates, has been attempted by bioterrorists, and has
been the intended outcome of at least 1 country's specially designed
missiles and artillery shells. Inhalational botulism has occurred
accidentally in humans. A brief report from West Germany in 1962 described
3 veterinary personnel who were exposed to reaerosolized botulinum toxin
while disposing of rabbits and guinea pigs whose fur was coated with
aerosolized type A botulinum toxin. Type A botulinum toxin was detected in
serum samples from all 3 affected individuals."
The laboratory incident citation (2) is in German. All 3 individuals
developed weakness, were treated with antitoxin, and survived. As I
recall, none required respiratory support. Unlike many other biological
warfare agents, the symptoms of intentional spread of botulism are no
different than those of natural disease. Suspicions should arise when a
large number of cases occur as happened in the recent Thai cluster (which
was not intentional).
