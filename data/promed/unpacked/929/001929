In ProMED post "Trypanosomiasis 足 Angola 20040208.0444" of 8 Feb 2004,
Dr Ndinga Dieyi Dituvanga, of the Institute for the Combat & Control of
Trypanosomiasis of Luanda, Angola, was quoted by the Star, South Africa, as
saying:
"In 2003, 96 Angolans died of sleeping sickness while 3115 new cases and
270 000 suspected cases were detected nationwide..."
and
"The 4 southern provinces of Kunene, Huambo, Namibe, and Huila are the only
ones not affected so far. However, it is virtually endemic in the 7
northern provinces of Bengo, Kwanza north and Kwanza south, Luanda,
Malange, Uige, and Zaire."
Dr Dituvanga <ndingadieyidituvanga@yahoo.fr> writes (in French) on 18 Feb
2004 that he was misquoted, namely:
- The 3115 new cases were not found among 270 000 suspect cases, but among
270 000 people examined.
- The whole of the province of Luanda is not infected, only zones peripheral
to the capital.
- The 4 southern provinces of Kunene, Huambo, Namibe, and Huila are indeed
free of sleeping sickness, but so are 7 other provinces (not listed) that
have the vector tsetse fly (_Glossina_) but are nevertheless free of sleeping
sickness, i.e. only 7 of Angola's 18 provinces have endemic disease.
Note also that the ProMED comment:
"This is the first report of widespread trypanosomiasis in the southern
provinces of Kunene, Huambo, Namibe, and Huila," is incorrect. 足- Mod.JW
