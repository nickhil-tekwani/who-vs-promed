The wetter weather this year [2010] has led to a 4-fold increase in
Ross River virus infections in the Riverina Murray region. The
region's public health unit director, Tracey Oakman, says the figures
are up but not in the hundreds as has occurred in the past.

"We've seen quite an increase in Ross River virus cases notified to
us," she said. "There's 96 in the Riverina region as opposed to 23 in
the same time last year [2009]. That had a lot to do with an increase
in mosquitoes -- a large increase in mosquitoes when the rains came.
Our Barmah Forest viruses [cases] didn't change at all. There were 3
last year [2009] and 2 this year [2010]."

Ms Oakman says mosquito activity is down now thanks to the cool
weather. "With mosquito numbers dropping the risk has significantly
dropped," she said. "We probably will see some notifications ... from
people who were bitten in the last month or so and who are yet to
have either a blood test or those results haven't come through from
the laboratory yet perhaps, so we'll probably see a few more yet."

[In a related ABC report of 4 May 2010
(<http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/05/04/2889581.htm>), Tracey
Oakman indicated that in south east New South Wales, "We received 9
notifications for Barmah Forest, and 23 for Ross River virus this
year to date until end of April [2010]," she said. "That's opposed to
only 2 Barmah Forest viruses notified to us last year [2009], and 8
Ross River viruses. So there's still an increase in both. Why Barmah
Forest instead of Ross River, it's difficult to say. It's whatever
the mosquitoes were carrying at the time."
