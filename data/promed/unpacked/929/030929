Title: Climate variability and transmission of epidemic polyarthritis
Authors: Shilu Tong, Peng Bi, Kevin Parton, Jack Hobbs, Anthony J McMichael
Among the potential impacts of climate change on health, changes in the
pattern of infectious diseases may be one of the most marked (1). Over the
past 2 decades, at least 30 new infectious diseases have emerged and many
diseases which had more or less disappeared in the western hemisphere have
resurged in many countries (2). While biological variability in pathogens,
a shift of resources away from infectious-disease control and public-health
systems, and widening social inequalities are contributing to the emergence
of infectious diseases, environmental changes have played a part (1). We
quantify the relationship of incidence of epidemic polyarthritis in
Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia with rainfall, temperature, and humidity.
Epidemic polyarthritis, characterised by arthritis, fever, rash, and
fatigue, is caused by Ross River virus. The disease was first described in
Narrandera and Hay, towns on the Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales,
Australia, in 1928. In 1959, the virus was isolated from Aedes vigilax
mosquitoes trapped at the Ross River near Townsville in Queensland (3).
Information on notified cases of epidemic polyarthritis in Toowoomba,
1986-95, was obtained from the Queensland Health Department. Population
data were retrieved from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Information
on rainfall, temperature, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), and humidity
was provided by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. [A graph] hows the
incidence rate of epidemic polyarthritis, and daily mean maximum and
minimum temperatures. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed that
increases in temperature (particularly in minimum temperature), rainfall,
humidity, and SOI were positively associated with the incidence of epidemic
polyarthritis.
Variation in temperature and incidence of epidemic polyarthritis in
Toowoomba between 1986 and 1995:
Climate variations partly determine longevity and population density of the
vector mosquitoes. It is likely that warmer and wetter conditions will
increase longevity and density of the vectors. In common with other
infectious diseases, transmission of epidemic polyarthritis is influenced
by many factors other than climate (4). However, in Toowoomba,
non-climatic variables have remained relatively stable over the past 2
decades. Our findings suggest that, if global warming continues as
predicted,(5) transmission of epidemic polyarthritis [the authors mean Ross
River virus, an etiologic agent of epidemic polyarthritis] may increase in
Australia and some other South Pacific countries.
