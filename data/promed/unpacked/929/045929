Suspected hepatitis E outbreak reported in Moroto
-------------------------------------------------
Fear has gripped residents of Moroto municipality [Moroto district] following a suspected outbreak of hepatitis E virus infection. Suspected cases have been reported in the south and north divisions of the municipality, with 40 cases registered since last week [week ending 7 Jul 2013].

Sister Marry Napeyok, the Moroto Municipal health inspector, said the villages of Nakapelimen and Naruwothy in the South Division, and Natumukathwo in the North Division have the highest [number of] registered cases. "Those who we registered with symptoms have not yet been admitted to the hospital, but they are receiving treatment from various health centres," she said. The Moroto District health officer, Dr Michael Ebele Omeke, confirmed the cases, but said samples have been sent to Kampala for tests. "We have not yet proved whether it is hepatitis E, until we get the results from the Central Public Health Laboratory," he said.

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by hepatitis E virus (a non-enveloped virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acid genome). Hepatitis E virus is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. It is usually a self-limiting infection which resolves within 4-6 weeks.

[A suspected outbreak of hepatitis E Virus [HEV] has been reported in 2 divisions in Moroto municipality of Moroto district, in northeastern Uganda. The cases appear to be mild since no admissions have been registered, and this is consistent with the usual asymptomatic, mild, or anicteric [without yellow discoloration] course that is seen in the majority of HEV cases.

HEV cases were reported in Moroto in 2010 and that outbreak was attributed to poor sanitation and hygiene standards in the same areas where the current cases have been reported. It is likely that over the years these factors have not been addressed and hence the recurrence of HEV cases in the district. Further information on the laboratory test outcomes will be appreciated.

[Confirmation of the provisional diagnosis of hepatitis E virus infection would be appreciated as soon as it becomes available. - Mod.CP]

[It is not obvious why a mild infection that resolves within a month should strike fear into the hearts of villagers. - Mod.JW]
