Palm oil industry under threat in Malaysia
------------------------------------------
Through extensive research and development (R&D) over the years, Malaysia
has built a successful national brand in palm oil and will soon emerge as a
leader in the production of bio-fuel. But not enough R&D is done to address
a deadly disease, which is affecting many oil palm plantations in Malaysia.
This disease is called ganoderma basal stem rot (BSR).
Identified more than 50 years ago, BSR, which usually affects mature palms,
is caused by a type of shelf or bracket fungus, _Ganoderma boninense_, and
is lethal and incurable. The disease is more prevalent in plantations that
have been replanted from coconut or oil palm. During replanting, if the
felled coconut or oil palm trunks and stumps are left to rot in the field,
various fruiting bodies of ganoderma may be produced and thrive.
The attack by ganoderma fungus will result in dry rot of internal tissues
around the base of palms. The rotting of the palm base can cause the
affected palms to easily topple during stormy weather.
The symptoms of BSR begin with the older fronds withering, drooping and
turning brown. As older fronds continue to die, younger leaves may wilt,
and the tips may turn brown. If not detected early and no control measures
are taken, the affected trees may die within 6 to 12 months after symptoms
develop, though some affected plants may hang on for several years.
Though BSR has been in existence for a long time, many plantation owners
tended to ignore it and considered it to be economically unimportant,
because it affected only some old palms. It was reported that initially the
disease was mainly confined to plantations in coastal areas. Now it has not
only reached epidemic proportions in coastal areas but also made
considerable inroads into inland soils.
It has also been reported that BSR is present in more than 50 per cent of
the oil palm plantations in Peninsular Malaysia. Without treatment, more
than 80 per cent of the affected plants may die by the time they reach less
than halfway through their lifespan. The losses can amount to a reduction
of 25 per cent to 45 per cent yield in fresh fruit bunches.
Sad to say, although this deadly disease has long been known, there is
currently no effective measure to eliminate it. So far, there are only
measures developed to reduce the risk and to control the disease. To reduce
the risk of ganoderma BSR infection, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB)
has recommended that proper technique of sanitation be adopted during
planting or replanting. The same technique can also be used to replace
palms that have been afflicted with the disease.
It is recommended that at replanting, all old palm tissues be destroyed by
shredding the trunks, stumps and roots into small fragments and spreading
them evenly to decompose. When the stumps and roots have been extracted, a
pit is dug and refilled with nearby soil. New plants are then planted away
from the former planting points. It has been reported by MPOB that by
adopting this technique, the incidence of BSR on replanted palms can be
reduced by 20 per cent after 8 years.
Besides sanitation, 2 techniques have so far been developed to control BSR
infected palms. But the use of both these control techniques can only
prolong the productive life of the infected plants by delaying the progress
of the infection.
One technique is the use of a pressure-injection apparatus capable of
delivering fungicides to the affected palms quickly and efficiently. This
apparatus was developed by MPOB. The most effective fungicides used in the
studies carried out by MPOB are bromoconazole and hexaconazole. However,
the cost effectiveness of the method has not been evaluated yet.
The other technique is soil mounding in areas with high incidence of BSR.
This technique involves building soil mounds around the base of palms. It
is cost effective and has been adopted in some plantations.
It is alarming to note that ganoderma BSR is fast becoming a major threat
to oil palm cultivation and palm oil production in Malaysia. Many of the
oil palm plantations are going into the 3rd generation of replanting, and
with no solution to cure or eradicate this disease in sight, it is no
wonder that many Malaysian plantation companies are starting to venture
into oil palm cultivation in neighboring countries that have greater virgin
land mass. These countries will benefit from our R&D in palm oil products
and bio-fuel, and may one day displace us as a market leader in palm oil
production.

[The African oil palm _Elaeis guineensis_ was introduced into Malaysia as
an oil crop in the early 1900s, and many large plantations of oil palms are
now in this area, with Malaysia growing over 20 000 square km. Malaysia
claims that in 1995, it was the world's largest producer of palm oil with
51 per cent of world production.
Basal stem rot disease, caused by the fungal pathogen _Ganoderma
boninense_, has long been recognized as the most serious disease of field
palms in South ast Asia, especially in replanted areas. The fungus is a
saprophyte that can infect a living palm if there is a large enough
inoculum. The fungus, which is soil-borne, initially invades one or more
roots and from there gradually extends into the stem, causing a dry rot,
especially in the base of the palm plant, that eventually leads to the
death of the palm. The disease can kill up to 80 percent of the stand by
the time the palms are halfway through their normal economic life span. It
constitutes a major threat to sustainable oil palm production in SE Asia
and affects palm oil production.
As with most soil-borne diseases, it is extremely difficult to control once
the disease has become established. The best approach for disease control
is avoidance. All potential sources of infection from old stems and roots
of oil palm and coconut should be destroyed, and fungicide should be used.
Attempts to control this disease in the field with fungicides have been
inconclusive, though some systemic fungicides seem to be promising. The
methods of fungicide application include soil drenching, trunk injection,
or combination of these 2 methods. None of the control methods practiced
has satisfactorily controlled or inhibited the spread or occurrence of this
fatal disease.
This report emphasizes the importance of this disease to Malaysia now that
it has not only reached epidemic proportions in coastal areas but has also
made considerable inroads into inland soils. The article also notes that
growers are so impacted by it that they are prepared to seek out virgin
land, even in other countries. In this area, the destruction of natural
rainforest to grow oil palm plantations is an issue of major environmental
concern, and this issue will not be minimized by the expanding influence of
basal stem rot on choice of planting areas.
