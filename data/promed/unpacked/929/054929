The Central Veterinary Laboratory of Algete has confirmed the detection of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus (HPAI) in a laying hen farm located in the municipality of Fontanar, in the province of Guadalajara. This is the 1st focus on poultry in Castilla-La Mancha. With these, there are 35 reported HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry in Spain in 2022 .

The site is a laying farm in the municipality of Fontanar, with approximately 601 000 animals , distributed in 6 buildings, 5 in cages and one on the ground. The suspicion of the disease was derived from the detection and communication of an abnormal increase in mortality on [8 Sep 2022] in one of the caged buildings. The samples taken during the official inspection visit carried out by the Official Veterinary Services (OVS) of the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha were sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory of Algete, the National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza in Spain, where it was confirmed that it is a strain of HPAI subtype H5N1.

The most likely route of introduction of the virus on the farm is considered to have been through contact with wild birds, given that this year [2022] the circulation of the virus among these birds is being maintained during the summer despite the high temperatures.

The veterinary services of the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha have immediately adopted the measures established in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/687 of the Commission, such as movement banning and surveillance activities.

In wild birds/non poultry birds, a total of 72 HPAI H5N1 cases have been detected in 2022 in the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Castilla y Le√≥n, Castilla-La Mancha, Cantabria, Catalonia, Extremadura, Galicia, Madrid, Navarra and the Basque Country (69 in wild birds and 3 in captive birds).

Although to date there is no evidence that the H5N1 subtype, circulating in Europe during the past year, has significant zoonotic capacity, it is recommended to avoid unnecessary contact with birds found dead or presenting clinical signs.

MAPA [Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food] insists on the need to reinforce biosecurity measures in poultry farms, in particular excluding contact with wild birds, as well as reinforcing passive surveillance both in poultry farms and in wild birds. Any suspicion of illness in the birds should be notified to the veterinary services officials.

[The 2021-2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic season has become the largest epidemic so far observed in Europe. The HPAI (H5) virus in wild birds seems to have become endemic in wild bird populations.

The event in Spain reflects a situation observed elsewhere throughout Europe: HPAI continues to be reported in domestic poultry and wild birds during the summer, though the number of detections reported by the EU reference laboratory (IZSVe) has been decreasing gradually since the start of August 2022. In the UK, for the 1st time, HPAI H5N1 has been maintained in bird populations over the summer months.

For FLI's map presenting H5 cases in Europe between 1 Oct 2021-15 Sep 2022 (poultry = red dots, wild = blue triangles, captive = red squares), see https://www.fli.de/de/aktuelles/tierseuchengeschehen/aviaere-influenza-ai-gefluegelpest/karten-zur-klassischen-gefluegelpest/.

For the number of HPAI positive events reported in poultry, captive and wild birds each week in Europe from October 2021 to 26 Aug 2022 (IZSVe, 2022), see Figure 2 on page 7 at https://tinyurl.com/bdcsxem3. - Mod.AS
