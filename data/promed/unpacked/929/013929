The measles [outbreak] appears to be under control at the 61st annual
Little League World Series [baseball]. No new cases or symptoms have
been reported, and the Japanese player who had them, was released
from isolation and cleared to play today [20 Aug 2007], league
spokesman Chris Downs said yesterday.
Eight of the 16 teams have been cleared, and the remaining 8 should
be cleared by today [20 Aug 2007], Downs said. Three teams -- Taiwan,
Mexico and Japan -- chose to have their players inoculated, he said.
Other teams are providing documentation their players have been
immunized or had the 7-day measles, he said.
After it was confirmed the player had measles, Little League and the
state Department of Health implemented a program to ensure any of the
estimated 500 people who visited the housing complex since the
Japanese team arrived were not infected. Those who were in
International Grove since the Tokyo team arrived early last week and
were born after 1957, when the measles shot was introduced, were
required to provide documentation showing immunization or a past bout
with measles.
Anyone who does not comply with the measures by tomorrow [21 Aug
2007] might be required by law to remain in the South Williamsport
area until 4 Sep 2007, 21 days after the Japanese team arrived, officials said.
The Health Department has been providing free immunizations as well
as blood tests that would show whether a person has had measles or
been inoculated. Little League officials met with parents of players
yesterday [19 Aug 2007] and were told many are having the needed
documentation sent, Downs said.

[Disruption of sports tournaments by mumps infection has been
relatively common in contact sports, whereas measles virus infection
has rarely been a problem due to the universality of measles
vaccination. It is significant that the index case has been a
Japanese participant in view of the concerns that have been expressed
recently regarding deficiencies in measles vaccination in Japan. - Mod.CP]
