[The current outbreak is located in the province of Gaza, next to the province of Maputo where FMD was also reported in 2015. In that event, serotype SAT 2 was identified. According to the epidemiological comments in the final report: "The current drought situation in the region is contributing to the concentration of a high number of stock in a few water bodies and increasing the movement of susceptible animals and interactions with wildlife species. Since the 1st notification of this event up to the end of September 2015, a total of 426 new cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) were detected (152 in Massingir district of Gaza Province and 274 in Magude district of Maputo province). 113 870 head of cattle were vaccinated through the vaccination program. No clinical case of FMD was reported from February 2016 to 11 Jun 2016."
