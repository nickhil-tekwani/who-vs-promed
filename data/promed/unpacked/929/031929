The high mortality rate of 46 out of 131 might have even increased if
the outbreak wasn't stamped out. We won't know this for sure until
the final report provides more detail. Also, the case fatality rate
of 46/66 is quite high, which is expected with classical swine fever,
also known as Hog Cholera. While there is some occasional occurrence
of classical swine fever in the Americas, the Caribbean countries
report more outbreaks, especially Cuba, with 123 outbreaks in 2004.
Brazil reported 12 outbreaks in 2001, none in 2002, 4 in 2003 and one
in 2004. - Mod.PC]
