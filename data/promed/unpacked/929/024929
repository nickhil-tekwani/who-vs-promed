Laboratory findings
-----------------
(Disease never reported before in Taipei China).
Emergency report
-------------
Information received on 28 July 2003 from Dr Watson H.T. Sung, Deputy
Director General, Bureau of Animal and Plant Inspection and Quarantine,
Council of Agriculture, Taipei:
Report date: 18 July 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of infection: 18 July 2003.
Sera collected on 2 May 2003 within the framework of routine serological
surveillance for bluetongue were found to be positive. The tracing-back
investigations that were carried out did not lead to the detection of any
animals presenting clinical signs of bluetongue.
Outbreaks:
--------
Location No. of outbreaks
Kinmen Prefecture 1
Pingtung Prefecture 1
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
bov 278 0* 0 0 0
cap 70 0* 0 0 0
* no animals have displayed clinical signs of bluetongue
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Institute for Animal Health
(NIAH).
B. Diagnostic tests used:
- competitive ELISA(1): positive;
- electron microscopy: detection of the orbivirus;
- RT-PCR(2): positive for bluetongue virus;
- DNA sequencing.
The serotype of the virus will be sought.
Source of agent / origin of infection: under investigation.
Control measures:
- Farms where seropositive animals were detected have been placed under
quarantine. In addition, for further clinical examination purposes, the
Livestock Disease Control Centres in the Prefectures have imposed
restrictions on the movement of susceptible animals.
- Cleaning and disinfection operations have commenced in order to decrease
the population of insect vectors.
- Further monitoring for possible active bluetongue infection has been
imposed around zoos and farms at risk.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
(2) RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

[Seroconversion in cattle and goats is indicative of the presence/activity of
infected vectors (_Culicoides_ spp. -- midges). The absence of clinical
bluetongue cases in a country is not indicative of the absence of infection.
Clinical cases are expected to be seen only in sheep -- and then only in
sheep of susceptible breeds. It will be interesting to get information on
the results of previous serological investigations in cattle in Taipei, if
such had been undertaken. - Mod.AS]
[Bluetongue has been reported in the East Asia region from Japan & South
Korea -- see refs. below. The Koreans claimed they found it in cattle
imported from Australia, which denies having the virus. - Mod.JW]
