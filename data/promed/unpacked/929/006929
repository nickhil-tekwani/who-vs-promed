The villages surrounding Hammana are awaiting lab results from samples of
eight springs suspected of causing a typhoid fever outbreak first detected
about 10 days ago. An estimated 27 typhoid cases have been treated in area
hospitals, with the latest admission taking place on Friday, area doctors
said Sunday.
"We've taken samples from Hammana, Falougha, Qornayel, Khreibeh and
Btekhney," said Walid Hawwari, a medical director at Falougha's Jabal
Hospital. "The results for Qornayel and Falougha are already out, and
they've confirmed that the spring sources in these villages are safe for
drinking," he added.
The results for Hammana, Khreibeh and Btekhney ­ where at least five cases
were reported to The Daily Star ­ will be ready by Wednesday at the latest,
according to the doctor.
The Health Ministry has been handling the outbreak, but sources close to
the ministry disclosed that "things are being kept low-profile in order to
avoid an unnecessary public scare or ruin the summer season." The ministry
refused to give any information until the medical tests results are
confirmed. The villages in the qada of Baabda are popular summer
destinations for both Lebanese and Gulf tourists.
In the meantime, many villagers are still drinking their water straight
from the springs, despite warnings from municipal council members to boil
the water, expose it to sunlight or even switch to bottled water.
[An eight-year-old boy spent six days in the hospital after he exhibited
the classic typhoid symptoms of high fever, stomach aches and loss of
appetite. But his mother admitted that they're still filling up from their
village spring in Btekhney and only boil the water occasionally.
"When you have a big family, you don't have much choice," [she said.
"You'd need huge basins." She shrugged her shoulders. "Whatever comes from
God is good." Others have switched to bottled water, but Btekhney
municipal council member Izzat Abul-Hosn acknowledged that not everyone can
afford it.
Abul-Hosn explained that their village spring was equipped with a
electrically-powered laser filter. "But the problem is that once we have a
power outage, it takes the generator about half an hour to kick in, leaving
the water without any filtering system," he said.
Hammana mayor George Rizk denounced what he called "wild" media reports
that there were outbreaks in his municipality, insisting that all houses
are connected to the municipal water network. Municipal and spring water
has been sent to government and a private lab for analysis, as well as to
AUH to be tested for typhoid, he said Sunday. "They should be ready in the
next two days," he added.
Typhoid fever is still common in the developing world, where it reportedly
affects about 12.5 million persons each year.
