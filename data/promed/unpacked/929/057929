Human Rabies Â— Texas and New Jersey, 1997
On October 19 and October 23, 1997, a man in Texas and a man in New Jersey,
respectively, died from rabies. This report summarizes the clinical
features of these cases and the epidemiologic investigations by the Texas
Department of Health and the New Jersey State Department of Health and
Senior Services, which indicated that a bat-associated variant of the
rabies virus was responsible for infection in both cases...
MMWR Editorial Note: Four cases of human rabies were documented in the
United States during 1997, including the two described in this report. This
report describes the first case of human rabies in New Jersey since 1971
and the 12th case in Texas during the same period. Of those 12 humans in
whom rabies had been diagnosed in Texas, seven (58%) involved variants of
rabies virus associated with dog and coyote populations and three (25%),
including the case in this report, involved variants of the rabies virus
associated with bats. Since 1980, a total of 21 (58%) of the 36 cases of
rabies diagnosed in the United States have been associated with bat
variants of the rabies virus, and the silver-haired bat/eastern pipistrelle
rabies virus variant has accounted for 15 (71%) of the 21.
Bats are increasingly implicated as important wildlife reservoirs for
variants of rabies virus transmitted to humans. Recent epidemiologic data
suggest that transmission of rabies virus can occur through minor bites
from bats. The limited injury inflicted by a bat bite (compared with
lesions caused by terrestrial carnivores) and situations in which the exact
exposure history is unavailable may limit the ability of health-care
providers to determine the risk for rabies resulting from an encounter with
a bat. In all potential human exposures involving bats, the bat in question
should be safely collected, if possible, and submitted through local or
state health departments for rabies diagnosis. PEP is recommended for all
persons who have sustained bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposures to a
bat unless the bat is available for testing and is negative for evidence of
rabies.
Although both cases described in this report had histories of contact with
a bat, neither reported being bitten. Of the 21 cases of human rabies
reported since 1980 that were caused by bat-associated rabies virus
variants, only one had a definite history of a bat bite.
Therefore, PEP also is appropriate even in the absence of a demonstrable
bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure in situations in which there is
reasonable probability that such contact occurred (e.g., a sleeping person
awakens to find a bat in the room or an adult witnesses a bat in the room
with a previously unattended child or mentally disabled or intoxicated
person). This recommendation used in conjunction with current Advisory
Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) guidelines should maximize the
ability of health-care providers to respond to situations in which accurate
exposure histories may not be obtainable and should minimize inappropriate
PEP.
ACIP recently recommended a change in the administration of human rabies
immune globulin (HRIG) for PEP: as much as possible of the full dose of
HRIG should be thoroughly infiltrated into and around the wound(s). Any
remaining volume should be administered intramuscularly at a site distant
from vaccine inoculation. Because bat rabies has been documented in the 49
continental United States and reduction of bat populations is not a
feasible, practical, or desirable strategy for rabies control in bats,
human and domestic animal contact with bats should be minimized. Bats
should be physically excluded from houses and surrounding structures by
sealing potential entrances. In addition, bats should never be handled by
untrained and unvaccinated persons without safety precautions and should
never be kept as pets.
