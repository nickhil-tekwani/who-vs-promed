Headlines
- In the run up to the WPV certification of the African region next year [2020], the Africa Regional Certification Commission is currently conducting a visit in Nigeria to analyze and verify the accuracy of the certification documents prepared by the Nigerian government. "It is important that the Nigerian government and partners avoid any complacency that could jeopardize Nigeria's removal from the list of polio-endemic countries and certification of wild poliovirus interruption for the African Region," said Dr Pascal Mkanda, coordinator at Polio Eradication Program, WHO Africa Regional Office, during the 37th session of the Expert Review Committee (ERC) on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization (RI) in Nigeria, which took place recently.

[WPV1 cases keep trickling in. With the 3 reported in this week's official update (see Poliomyelitis update (95): Pakistan (SD, KP) Afghanistan (KD) 20191204.6822582 for initial reports of the 3 cases reported from Pakistan this week) and the 6 cases reported through media reports in the past 2 days (see section [2] and [3] below and Poliomyelitis update (98): Afghanistan, Philippines, Pakistan, violence 20191211.6835536), as of yesterday [Wed 11 Dec 2019], the official tally of WPV1-associated paralytic disease is now at 116 (not counting the additional cases mentioned above). I used the word "trickling" to describe the reports, in contrast to the cVDPV case reports, which have been pouring in over the past weeks. Last week there were 16 cases reported; this week there are 22 cases. Country reports of notice include the total numbers of cases reported from Angola (71), DR Congo (53), Nigeria (18 in 2019 and 34 in 2018), Central African Republic (16), and Pakistan (11, although the media report in section [2] below mentions there have been 12 cases).

For a map showing the locations of both WPV-associated cases and cVDPV-associated cases, see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 18 months below. The size of the list remains impressive, now with 24 countries: 15 in Africa, 5 in Asia, and 4 in the Western Pacific, with either WPV or cVDPV isolates in their countries. An important reminder is that positive environmental samples means that the virus is circulating in the area where the samples have been obtained. Hence, if a susceptible individual is infected with the virus, there is a chance the person may develop paralytic disease.

[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa)
Date: Thu 12 Dec 2019

https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2019/12/12/polio-on-the-rise-as-four-more-cases-reported-in-kp/


The tally of polio cases this year [2019] in the country has reached 98, excluding 12 vaccine-derived cases, after 4 polio cases were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KP) Lakki Marwat and Tank districts on Thursday [12 Dec 2019].

In Lakki Marwat, poliovirus was detected in a 3-month-old boy and an 11-month-old girl in tehsil Sarai Naurang. The 3rd case in the district was reported in union council Dara Tang involving an 11-month-old girl. According to the polio emergency operation centre, the cases were a result of the children not being administered polio drops.

Meanwhile, in Tank, polio was confirmed in a 12-month-old girl.

According to an emergency operation centre (EOC) for polio: "Lakki Marwat and Bannu have become high-risk districts for polio cases in 2019. Out of the 98 polio cases reported in the country this year [2019], 72 were reported in KP, 14 in Sindh, 7 in Balochistan, and 5 in Punjab. In addition, 12 VDPV2 polio cases were also reported across districts in Pakistan."

In spite of tall claims by the government and several anti-polio drives, there has been no let-up in the polio cases across the country, with the cases being reported in regular intervals in Sindh and KP. These 2 provinces are among the worst-affected regions, witnessing a spike over the recent months.

[With the addition of these 4 newly confirmed cases of WPV1-associated paralysis, there have now been 98 cases of WPV1-associated disease in Pakistan, and with the 2 additional cases reported in the media yesterday [Wed 11 Dec 2019] from Afghanistan, bringing the Afghanistan total to 24 cases during 2019, the global tally this year [2019] will be at least 122, the highest number of annual cases reported since 2015 (see http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Weekly-GPEI-Polio-Analyses-wpv-20191212.pdf).

This media report also mentions a total of 12 cVDPV2-associated cases, albeit details are not provided. This additional case is included in the End Polio Pakistan website listing (see https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces). Presumably, details will be included in next week's global update.

[3] Afghanistan (Baghlan): more information on case
Date: Thu 12 Dec 2019
Source: Pajhwok [edited]
https://www.pajhwok.com/en/2019/12/12/baghlan-1st-polio-case-detected-8-years


A new polio case has been registered in the Dand-i-Ghori district of northern Baghlan province, an official said on Thursday [12 Dec 2019]. Public health director Dr. Mohibullah Habib told Pajhwok Afghan News that a 4-year-old child tested positive for polio in Mangalo village.

"The result of our examination shows the virus is from the Peshawar city of Pakistan. It's yet to be clear whether the family has recently come from Pakistan," he added.

The director said provincial doctors would hold a meeting to determine where the virus had come from.

It is the 1st polio case to be detected in Baghlan since 2011.

[This media report mentions that the virus isolated in this case is genetically related to a virus circulating in Peshawar, Pakistan. Discussions surrounding the epidemiology of the continued WPV1 circulation in Pakistan and Afghanistan recognize the movement of people (and the virus) between the 2 countries on a regular basis. Hence, identification of a WPV1 in Afghanistan that is genetically linked to a WPV1 identified in Peshawar, Pakistan, is not surprising.
