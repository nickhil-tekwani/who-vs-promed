A mite-borne rickettsial infection [scrub typhus], seen primarily in the rural populace in the past, is now being increasingly detected in people residing in expanding cities across the country.

The resurgence of this disease can be attributed to rising urbanization. The vectors, ticks and mites have now found their residence in urban bushes, with the increase in transport, influx of people, and city limits merging into nearby rural areas.

The disease epidemiology, experts say, has been changing with increasing urbanization. In view of this, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has developed guidelines on diagnosis and management of rickettsial diseases in India in 2015. Of all rickettsioses cases, scrub typhus is the most common and accounts for up to 50 percent of undifferentiated fever presenting to hospital.

"Rickettsial infections are generally incapacitating and difficult to diagnose; untreated cases have case fatality rates as high as 30-45 percent with multiple organ dysfunction if not promptly diagnosed and treated. The ICMR's guidelines define a framework for recognizing manifestations, identifying appropriate diagnostic tests, and initiating prompt and effective treatment," M D Gupte, chair (epidemiology), ICMR, told The Times of India on Mon 11 May 2015.

The vast variability and non-specific presentation of this infection have often made it difficult to diagnose clinically. Acute fever is the most common presenting symptom, associated with breathlessness, cough, nausea, vomiting, myalgia and headache. An eschar (dead tissue that sheds or falls off from healthy skin) at the site of the chigger bite can be seen in early disease and is a useful diagnostic clue in scrub typhus, though its frequency varies from 7-97 percent.

While a rash is considered as hallmark of rickettsial disease, it is neither seen at presentation nor in all patients. Presence of rash is common in spotted fever and extremely rare in scrub typhus. "However, none of these clinical symptoms and signs, including eschar, is diagnostic of rickettsial disease. Therefore, epidemiological factors pertaining to geographical area, habitat, occupation, movement of the subject (vocational or recreational) could assist in reaching a diagnosis of rickettsial disease with certainty and initiating treatment on time," Gupte said.

Complications of scrub typhus usually develop after the 1st week of illness. Jaundice, renal failure, pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, myocarditis and meningoencephalitis are various complications known with this disease. Pneumonia is one of the most frequent complications of scrub typhus, which manifests as a non-productive cough and breathlessness and leads to ARDS, which could be life-threatening. Severe complications include hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), renal or kidney failure, meningo-encephalitis (inflammation of the brain and meninges), and myocarditits (inflammation and damage to the heart muscle) with shock may occur in varying proportions of patients.

"Prompt antibiotic therapy, even based on suspicion, shortens the course of the disease, lowers the risk of complications, and reduces morbidity and mortality due to rickettsial diseases. Currently, doxycycline is regarded as the drug of choice," infectious diseases expert Bharat Purandare said.

There is an urgent need for physicians and health-care workers at all levels in India to be aware of the clinical features, available diagnostic tests and their interpretation, and the therapy of these infections.

"The guidelines have been developed to help treating physicians towards correct diagnosis and treatment. For want of awareness in physicians and the community, diagnostic delays result in patients presenting to tertiary care centers with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other severe complications. The guidelines will definitely help in diagnosing and treating these cases and bring in uniformity in line of treatment," said an infectious diseases expert.

Cases of rickettsioses have been reported from several states in India, including Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Bihar, West Bengal, Meghalaya, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

[The following is from a previous post by my colleague Mod.ML:

Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm).

Illness in humans develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, lymphadenopathy, and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness. Because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent, treatment with doxycycline should begin immediately upon suspicion of scrub typhus without awaiting laboratory confirmation (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf).

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.
