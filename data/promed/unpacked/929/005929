A 38-year-old man who was a poultry worker, was admitted in the Gualeguaychú hospital during the holidays, suspected of having contracted [a] hantavirus [infection] or leptospirosis. A complaint was lodged against the farm where he worked.

The department of Gualeguaychú confirmed that the poultry worker was hospitalized since [Wed 20 Dec 2017] in a private clinic in the city for a zoonosis yet to be determined.

The 38-year-old man died as a result of a serious viral clinical condition compatible with [a] hantavirus [infection] or leptospirosis. His family lodged a complaint to the government that was sent to government prosecutor's office, in turn, stating directly that the chicken production facility where he worked was a place plagued with rats, the vector of these diseases.

The prosecutor's office authorized an autopsy of the man's body to know the specific cause of death while awaiting the results of samples for serology that were sent to [technologically] advanced laboratories in Santa Fe and Buenos Aires.

The Senior Commissioner, Carlos Pérez, confirmed the complaint lodged by the man's wife, who is a nurse and who had complained about the case to the area epidemiological node in the Centenario Hospital in Gualeguaychú. She pointed out that her husband's death was due to the bad conditions on the poultry farm where he worked where "there are many rats that urinate on the poultry feed and the workers have no sanitary protection," she had stated.

In a dialogue in an on-line program, Commissioner Pérez indicated that the [health] status of the man worsened in recent days without a specific diagnosis and that the prosecutor's office had ordered an autopsy.

The man's illness began on [Wed 20 Dec 2017]. In the days before his death, his wife stated that the man wished to continue working. "He was always concerned about his job, so much so that he did not want to say anything about what was occurring inside, nor did the other guys for fear of losing their jobs," she had asserted.

The plant has some 15 000 birds divided among 4 houses. "The rats and mice are seen all the time; I have seen them. They move in the chicken feed, running between the houses. One can see their feces," she stated.

The employees "do not have personal protection equipment, work without masks, without gloves, have just one set of clothes for each one that is washed once per week by the wife of the boss. They make them wash [shower?] in the establishment before leaving every day. They clean up to leave but within [the facility] there are no safety conditions."

"The chicken houses and the place where the employees eat [is] sometimes [where] the food is put on top of the shelves where the insecticides are kept, " said Marisa Verón, speaking for her [deceased] fellow worker. There is no dining area for them, not even a room away. No one has gone to instruct them about hygiene and adecuate safety measures. They do not have cleaning materials such as bleach. They drink water from the well, not from the city system. As for the chicken feed, it is rice husks that comes in 50 k [120 lb] bags that must be divided into 35 individual lots. The rats move and urinate on the bags. This raises dust that they breathe," she cited as an example.

The complaint was made on [Thu 4 Jan 2018] to Epidemiological Surveillance with Dr. Diego Garcilazo in charge, who confirmed the investigation of this case. "It seems that he had [a] hantavirus [infection] or leptospirosis, or some kind of influenza," he had stated. The relevant tests cannot be made in Entre Rios, so that some will go to Buenos Aires, others to Santa Fe and other [tests] will be done in the capital of our province. The results will take at least a week.

[It is odd that there is no mention of the symptoms for this case, nor the basis for suspecting a hantavirus infection or leptospirosis. As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the cases. Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this Entre Rios province case. Although Andes virus seems unlikely, Seoul virus with the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) host is another possibility. ProMED would appreciate receiving further information coming from the autopsy and laboratory test results.

Although mice and rats were mentioned as possible rodent hosts in the report above, the rodent host of the suspected hantavirus endemic in this area has not been reported above.
