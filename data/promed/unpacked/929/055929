DUCK VIRAL ENTERITIS - UK (03): CORRECTION

Duck viral enteritis (DVE) does not appear in the 2011 OIE listed
diseases
(http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/oie-listed-diseases-2011/),
but duck viral hepatitis (DVHV) does.

DVE (also known as duck plague) is a herpesvirus.

Recent references characterise DVHV type I as a picornavirus, type II
an astrovirus, and type III also probably a picornavirus (ref: Poultry
Diseases, 6th Edition, chapter 29, Picornaviridae, Gough RE and
McNulty MS, 2008).

DVHV is a disease of young ducklings up to about 7 weeks, whereas DVE
usually, at least in our sporadic cases, affects adults or
sub-adults.

The ease with which such similarly named diseases may be confused is
readily apparent, particularly as both diseases cause hepatitis!

[Dr Stidworthy's comment is correct and appreciated.

Duck virus enteritis was deleted from the OIE list of notifiable
diseases in May 2005 when the 73rd General Session approved the
document "73 SG/12/CS1" (Report of OIE terrestrial animal health
standards commission of January 2005); see
http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/A_SCCDAJAN2005.pdf
(page 42).

The deletion was based upon the recommendations of an ad-hoc group
which advised that DVE did not fit the requirements of an animal
disease to be included in the list, since "there is no evidence of its
international spread, and the disease is not zoonotic."

In addition, the group stated that DVE "is not notifiable in most
countries, including those in which duck production is important."

OIE's criteria for listing diseases, and the full updated list, are
included in chapter 1.2. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code; see
http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.1.2.htm.
There are 14 OIE-notifiable avian diseases at present.

DVE chapters are still maintained in OIE's Terrestrial Code and
Manual.

This moderator's comment on the apparent absence of UK reporting on
DVE to the OIE since 2005 requires, therefore, a correction. No
reporting (or surveillance) of DVE have been required by the OIE since
2006. - Mod.AS]
