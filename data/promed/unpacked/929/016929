Pakistan: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever: case details
-------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD: 3 people have died recently while 4 others have been admitted to
hospital with [suspected] Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in the south
western province of Baluchistan in the latest outbreak of the illness that
has plagued the largest -- and poorest -- of Pakistan's provinces since
2001, claiming over 200 victims, according to a government official.

"There has been a total of 7 cases. Three have died and 4 have recovered,"
Dr Shafi Zehri, the provincial health secretary, told IRIN from
Baluchistan's capital, Quetta. Among the survivors was a single Afghan,
Zehri said. "The outbreak was not in Quetta, but is in rural areas. The
cases were all from Qilla Saifullah and Zhob [both outlying rural areas in
Baluchistan]. The surviving patients were immediately quarantined, but are
okay now," he stressed.

A severe disease, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever can be caused by a tick
bite or contact with an infected animal or person. The infected person
suddenly becomes ill with fever, dizziness, neck pain, aching muscles and
stiffness, and recurrent headaches within a few days. Soon, after vomiting
and diarrhoea have set in, the volume of blood platelets falls, causing the
blood to be unable to clot properly. The bleeding then begins: from the
gums, from under the skin, in the nose and internal organs. Without
treatment, a patient can literally bleed to death.

"[The outbreak] is due to tick infestation of [local] livestock. We have
treated the livestock in the areas where the cases was reported. The
livestock department rushed there and treated animals affected by ticks,"
Zehri said.

Including the latest cases, a total of 231 cases of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic virus infection have been reported in Baluchistan since 2001,
the health secretary noted. There is no vaccine against the virus. About 30
per cent of people who contract the disease can die even after receiving
medical treatment. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is an especially big
problem in neighbouring Afghanistan, where outbreaks can occur when the
weather turns warmer, because of an increasing tick population. Preventive
sprays are unavailable because of resource constraints with the result that
ticks infect sheep and goats, exposing the many Afghans who live and work
around livestock to great health risks.

Pakistan: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever outbreak confirmed
------------------------------------------------------------
QUETTA: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever has killed 4 people and infected
at least 6 more in Pakistan, health officials said on Monday. Tariq Khoso,
medical superintendent at Fatima Jinnah Chest Hospital in the south western
city of Quetta, said 6 patients suffering from the fever had been admitted
and placed in an isolation ward. "They arrived at the hospital in the past
week from 2 affected regions," Khoso told Reuters in the city, capital of
Baluchistan province bordering Afghanistan. "We have sent medical teams to
the affected area of Qila Saifullah and adjoining Islambagh to monitor the
situation there," Baluchistan province's director general for health, Pir
Mohammad Khawajakhel, told Reuters.

A World Health Organization official confirmed that the disease had killed
4 people but said there was no immediate threat of an outbreak as doctors
were monitoring the situation. Health officials say more than 300 cases of
the disease have been recorded in Pakistan since 2001 and of those 38
people have died including some doctors, nurses and surgeons.
