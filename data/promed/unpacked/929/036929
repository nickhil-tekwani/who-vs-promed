The case of anthrax [reported in ProMED-mail post 20060227.0634],
with its connection to goat skins imported from Africa, is
reminiscent of the last recorded human case of cutaneous anthrax in a
British Columbia woman in December 2001.
In that case the woman was hospitalized with what appeared to be
_Bacillus anthracis_ skin lesions. Under a presumptive clinical
diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax, it was noted that the woman had
received antibiotics before anthrax confirmation was [attempted] by
culture. The British Columbia Center for Disease Control (BC CDC) was
initially unable to culture anthrax, probably because the woman had
received antibiotics before the culture samples were collected.
However, BC-CDC was eventually able to culture _B. anthracis_ after
consultation with our [Animal Diseases Research Institute laboratory]
in Lethbridge, Alberta.
The woman and 5 other people had attended drum-making classes in
which drums were made from untanned dried goat skins imported from
Africa. The hides were usually immersed in a mixture of Javex and
water for several hours before being used, but in this case they were
soaked in water only. Javex is a commercially available 2 percent
bleach (Sodium Hypochlorite) solution; see web site
<http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/chemicals/cn/Sodium%A0Hypochlorite.html>
A detailed investigation revealed that the hides had originated in
Ghana and about 300 had arrived in Halifax in August 2001. The
importer was from Richmond BC, and some of the imported hides were
used in the drum-making class. Only one of the 6 students developed
cutaneous anthrax. The CFIA collected hide samples from 2 locations
-- the importer's premises in Richmond and the patient's home.
On 13 Dec 2001, the CFIA's Center of Expertise for Anthrax in
Lethbridge, Alberta isolated anthrax in the skins collected from both
locations. All the remaining hides were collected and incinerated, as
were the gloves and the wrapping material in contact with the hides.
The wooden drums and metal instruments used in the drum-making
process were either incinerated or disinfected according to protocol
established by Communicable Disease Epidemiology, British Columbia
Center for Disease Control. 6 premises in BC's lower mainland were
implicated in the investigation.
I wish to thank Drs. Pam Gale and Larry Turner from the CFIA's
Lethbridge Laboratory, and Drs. Doug Aitken, Rod Livingstone and
Daniel Schwartz from the CFIA's field operations in B.C. for their
help on various elements of this case.

[Our thanks to Les and his colleagues for providing the necessary
reminder of the risks involved in casually purchased hides. I am
myself thankful because this outbreak was odd for time (mid-winter)
and place (British Columbia of all places!), and the original
published reports put the cause down to the woman's scarf -- why, I
don't know. Now it all makes sense. Thanks, Les. - Mod.MHJ]
