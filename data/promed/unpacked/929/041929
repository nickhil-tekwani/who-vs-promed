Avian influenza in Burkina Faso
-------------------------------------
Translation of information received on 4 Apr 2006 from Dr. Zacharie
Compaore, Director of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Animal Resources,
Ouagadougou:
Report date: 3 Apr 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease or
infection in a country or zone/compartment.
Identification of agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 1 Mar 2006.
An outbreak of avian influenza subtype H5N1 has been reported at a camp
site at Gampela, Saaba department, Kadiogo province. Following the death of
123 helmeted guineafowls, samples have been taken and sent to the Instituto
Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie in Padova (Italy), OIE Reference
Laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease, which has confirmed
the diagnosis.
The following control measures have been undertaken:
- radio and television national broadcast; provincial decision notifying
the outbreak; quarantine; census of traditionally raised poultry and
stamping-out in a sequestration zone; screening; zoning; disinfection of
the infected zone.
The following measures are due to be implemented:
- stamping-out or vaccination of poultry in modern farms, depending on the
level of hygiene measures routinely applied; - stepping up of
epidemiological surveillance and sampling of poultry and wild birds for
submission to the reference laboratory.

[This is the 5th country in Africa to report avian influenza. The outbreak
is located right at the center of the country, both geographically and
politically, as Kadiogo province is home to Ouagadougou, the capital of
Burkina Faso. The outbreak appears to have occurred in commercial poultry,
which may implicate commerce in the spread of infection. On the other hand,
Burkina Faso has many lakes and rivers which may support migratory bird
populations. Burkina Faso is located in the same semi-arid climate band
that includes Northern Nigeria, Niger and the reported site in Northern
Cameroon.
Given the spread within Nigeria to the southwest areas near Ibadan, Ghana
is confronted with avian influenza to its west and north. Burkina Faso is
one the poorest countries in the world and is heavily dependent on
livestock agriculture. Approximately 4 out of 5 people in the country make
their living from agriculture, so any spread of this disease will have
ramifications on the economy and on human health by restricting adequate
supplies of meat. Just another way that disease in animals can have an
effect on human health. - Mod.PC]
