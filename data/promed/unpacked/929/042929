Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) has hit the University of California (UC)
Lindcove Research Center hard this spring [2007], with the find that
the aphid-spread disease has infected 44 trees on the 175-acre
(71-hectare) station, along with 4 trees on the highly guarded Citrus
Cloning Protection Program (CCPP) block of trees used for budwood
distribution to citrus nurseries.
This block is protected as disease-free but now that protection is in
doubt. Every tree at this station is tested annually each spring to
insure the trees are disease free. Unlike past years, this year's
[2007] results were startling.
"This is more than a 4-fold jump in the incidence of tristeza at
Lindcove," says Citrus Research Board President, Ted Batkin. "We saw
3 trees that were positive for tristeza in 2004, one tree in 2005,
and 3 in 2006, to 44 in the spring of 2007, a likely sign that the
disease has reached a new level and that aphid activity is high." [A
communication sent on 11 May 2007] to the farmers expecting to get
budwood in June [2007], says that the "biggest concern of the CCPP
however, is 9 additional high readings of the ELISA [enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay] test from trees scattered in the Foundation
Blocks and Cultivar Bank, in combination with some initial Mexican
lime reactions of the biological indexing. These findings generate a
very uncertain situation for the safe use of the Foundation and
Evaluation Blocks trees in the budwood cut of June 2007.
Uncertain situation
-------------------
"If the incidence of tristeza in the outdoor Foundation Blocks is
found to have risen to a level that indicates that it would not be
safe or prudent for the CCPP to distribute budwood from these trees,
then orders would be filled as best as [possible] from Screenhouse
Protected Foundation trees", says the bulletin.
"The CCPP has already registered many of the Screenhouse Protected
Foundation Block in-ground trees for budwood distribution as was
requested previously by the industry, and [it is] working towards the
registration of the potted varieties as well. In addition, a review
process has already begun for the in-ground planted varieties in an
effort to increase the number and variability of the in-ground trees.
However, if the CCPP is forced to abandon the outdoor Foundation and
Evaluation Blocks as the main source of budwood, the distribution
patterns will be severely affected," says the bulletin. "The volume
of budwood that the CCPP will be able to provide to the industry will
be significantly reduced and the trueness to type of varieties will
be more difficult to assess."
The program enjoys the benefit of protection of a foundation block of
trees in an industry-financed screenhouse that remains free of the
disease. The bulletin notes that if the outdoor distribution of
budwood is in danger, "the distribution pattern will be severely affected."
Batkin says it is likely the presence of the disease comes from
surrounding fields of citrus that are no longer being monitored for
tristeza nor eradicated by the Tulare County Pest Control District,
which pulled out of the tristeza eradication business about 5 years ago.
The Central Valley Tristeza Agency continues to operate in southern
Tulare County and all of Fresno and Kern, but not in Tulare County's
most productive citrus area near Exeter and Lindsay covered by the
Tulare County Pest Control District. Since the pest control district
is not monitoring or eradicating the disease by pulling infected
trees, there is buildup of inoculums in the area particularly in the
southwest part of the grove, says the bulletin.
Find another location?
----------------------
Batkin says the citrus industry may need to find another location to
maintain disease-free budwood, and that CTV pressure is likely to
[increase]. [According to Batkin, the research predicted] that, if
left on its own, the virus would spread and more severe varieties of
the virus would likely be found as well. The fear is that the spread
of the disease will be exponential.
The majority of growers in the Tulare County Pest Control District
voted not to participate in the tristeza suppression effort in
several votes 5 and 7 years ago. Farmers who objected to the removal
of trees said that because of their rootstock, tristeza had only a
minor effect on their trees in production. But, of course, it remains
a reservoir of disease source that spread to other farmers' trees
through the aphid activity. The only way to fight the disease is to
remove the tree. Scientists say cotton aphids are a main vector for
the disease.
"We looked at this scenario 10 years ago," says Ted Batkin and that's
why they solicited help for the one and half acre screenhouse that
protects from flying aphids. However, that screenhouse can't supply
the budwood for the citrus industry and if UC can't certify the
budwood as disease free, they will need to find another place to do it.
Batkin says as concerned as they are about tristeza, the citrus
industry's bigger concern is over other exotic diseases coming to
Tulare County, particularly 'citrus greening', which has a stronghold
on trees in Florida right now.

[Thank you to Prof Dodds who fought to prevent the Tulare County Pest
Control District from withdrawing from the Central Valley suppression
program 10 years ago. He adds this comment: "The short sighted
decision by the Tulare County Pest Control District to withdraw from
the Central Valley suppression program has now had its inevitable
consequence." This appears to be a disaster due to ignoring the
scientists' advice.
Citrus tristeza virus, genus _Closterovirus_, family
_Closteroviridae_, causes a range of symptoms including stunting,
die-back, yellowing, and stem-pitting on a number of citrus species.
It is spread by several aphid species and can also be transmitted by
grafting and mechanical means. It appears to be spreading wherever
citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in the severity of
symptoms caused, and the tolerance of certain scion/rootstock
combinations can no longer be taken for granted. Careless
introduction of severe strains such as the 'orange stem pitting'
strain is a constant risk. Of all the citrus diseases, over 30 are
caused by viruses and virus-like organisms, and of these, CTV is
considered to be one of the most destructive, killing millions of
trees every year worldwide.
