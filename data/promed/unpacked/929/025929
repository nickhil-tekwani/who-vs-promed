Common deer virus found in southern Ohio cattle populations
-----------------------------------------------------------
Ohio Department of Agriculture (ODA) officials today [30 Aug 2007]
confirmed the discovery of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) -- a
common white-tailed deer virus -- in 2 Pike County cattle farms. This
marks the state's 1st-ever case of the virus in cattle, but officials
stress that it poses no threat to human health or to the safety of
meat consumption.
The ODA Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Reynoldsburg
confirmed EHD in cattle populations in southern Ohio. The virus,
which has been found in several surrounding states, occurs annually
in deer herds across North America but is less common in cattle. In
the Pike County cattle, officials identified a wild strain of the EHD
virus, which will run its course much like the common flu. In deer,
EHD is typically fatal.
Both cattle and deer contract EHD from gnats or biting flies. The
virus cannot be spread from animal to animal or from animal to
humans. Insects, however, can contract the virus from infected deer
or cattle and pass it on to surrounding populations. This summer's
[2007] drought has forced animals and insects to common watering
spots, increasing the spread of EHD. Typically, the onset of cold
weather suppresses the disease as frosts drive insects into winter inactivity.
Although test results have not confirmed the southern Ohio deer
population has been infected with EHD, the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources will continue to monitor and test deer in this area for the virus.
According to the University of Georgia's annual Southeastern
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, EHD is the most common ailment
affecting deer in the Eastern United States. Outbreaks of the disease
have occurred in Indiana, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Virginia, and West Virginia this year [2007]. The most recent Ohio
outbreaks occurred in 2003 in Clermont and Brown counties. The
disease is common in portions of the northern Great Plains and the
southeastern United States. It was 1st identified in 1955 in New
Jersey. Mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep, and pronghorn antelope are
also susceptible to the disease.

[Cattle populations having EHD without the deer in the area having
the disease is very unusual. Ohio has a number of captive cervid
herds and often they are the 1st to report the deaths. It would be
nice if we had more insight into how the DNR is conducting their surveillance.
Other countries have EHD in cattle on a more regular basis than is
found in the US.
Clinical signs in cattle generally consist of: anorexia, a decrease
in rumination, a decrease in milk production, weakness, dyspnea, and
fever. There is often a clear to purulent nasal discharge,
salivation, and redness of the nose and lip region. These may be dry
and scaly as well. The tongue may be swollen and have erosions. When
one sees signs of anorexia, and erosions on the tongue, it is easy to
understand why it would be a differential for foot-and-mouth disease
virus. Other clinical signs include conjunctival hyperemia, lameness
and/or a stiff gate, muscle tremors, and often recumbency with a
reluctance to move. Not all clinical signs may be present in any one
herd. The clinical disease is variable and may last from a few days
to as long as 2 weeks. - Mod.TG
