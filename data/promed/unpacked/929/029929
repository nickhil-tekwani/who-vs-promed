[The 1st outbreak of bluetongue (BT) disease in Greece dates back to 1979, caused by BTV serotype 4. The disease returned in 1998 to continental Greece, causing, between 1998-2001, numerous outbreaks, mainly by BTV-4 and BTV-9, less by BTV-16 and in 2001 by BTV-1. For a map showing these events, see page 6 in the reference.

No outbreaks in sheep have been reported on continental Greece between 2001 and 2014. Since 2008, outbreaks have been reported, limited to the Aegean parts of Greece, namely on islands adjacent to the western Turkish coast, in particular Chios and Lesvos. During 2013, Greece reported 94 outbreaks of bluetongue, serotype 4, from the said region. The event was resolved in August 2013. An update and map for this event can be obtained at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013917_20130826_180806.pdf. The current outbreak, on the southern part of continental Greece, represents a spread westwards compared to the situation in recent years.

It will be interesting to obtain information on the breed and age of the affected animals. The Greek sheep breed Chios is known to be susceptible to BTV, with relatively high case-mortality rates in unvaccinated sheep.
