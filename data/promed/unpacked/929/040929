Between September and November 1999, Algeria's official veterinary services
have killed 131 cows believed to be carrying Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE, or mad-cow disease). The cattle were imported by
private operators and German authorities have been informed by the problem.
As a result, Algeria has suspended all imports of German beef until further
notice.
Following the Algerian decision, Germany sent 2 envoys to Algeria to
investigate the matter. They are Dr. Werner Zwingmann, head of the federal
veterinary services and Dr. Klaus Meyn, representing the German beef and
dairy industries. Their investigation within Algeria led to the recognition
that the results of the Algerian authorities were correct and they pledged
to reimburse the importers and cattle owners some form of compensation.
