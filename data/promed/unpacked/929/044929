Unknown Illness Strikes 11 Horses
---------------------------------
According to news reports 11 horses have succumbed to a mysterious
illness within a 15-kilometer area around Barrie, Ontario.
Details remain sketchy as officials from the University of Guelph and
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency continue investigations on Friday
(19 Nov 2004).
Horse owners are reporting that the previously healthy horses
developed signs including cold sweats, diarrhea, fever, loss of
appetite, rapid heartbeat and colic.
Track officials at Georgian Downs have not received any calls from
owners of Standardbred horses suffering from the symptoms to date.
Further information will be posted as it becomes available.

[If these horses are all on the same feed, the 1st differential that
comes to mind is an ionophore in the feed. Ionophores often produce
the abnormal heart rate and colic. If the colic has been particularly
painful, it may produce some muscle contractions or fasciculations
such that the body temperature may elevate above normal. However,
with these horses having acute onset and fever, infectious disease
may be a more likely candidate for the cause of the problem. - Mod.TG]
