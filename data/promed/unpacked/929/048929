149 cases in new human anthrax outbreak
---------------------------------------
An anthrax outbreak that began in November [2011] has affected 4 provinces in Zimbabwe. As of 31 Dec 2011, 149 human cases of anthrax had been reported, although there were no deaths. Affected areas are Centenary, Mbire, and Mt Darwin in Mashonaland Central, Mutoko in Mashonaland East, Nkayi in Matabeleland North, and Chirumhanzu and Gokwe North in the Midlands provinces. In some places like Mbire, the outbreak was attributed to consumption of meat from infected dead animals.

In response various activities have been initiated in both Zimbabwe and neighbouring Zambia, which is also affected. In Zimbabwe, provincial and district Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have been activated and movement of animal in affected areas stopped. In addition, active case finding and search of meat and skins of dead animals in the community, intensified health education, and community awareness campaigns' distribution of IEC [information, education, and communication] materials in local languages, burning and burying of carcasses, and disinfection of contaminated areas using chloride of lime are being conducted. Members of RRTs visited neighbouring Zambia to verify the diagnosis of the disease among wild animals there; record Zimbabwean cases seeking treatment on the Zambian side; assess control measures being implemented on the Zambian side; share experiences; and assess collaborative activities put in place to control the disease.

[We are now in that frustrating but necessary phase of correcting numbers and diagnoses. In the previous report there were 33 human cases in Mt. Darwin and now 35. But on the other hand the previous 2 cases in Centenary have been retracted as not anthrax. - Mod.MHJ]
