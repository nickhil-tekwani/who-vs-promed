[1] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa): 2 additional cases (now 4)

The total number of polio cases across the country has touched 102, including 9 vaccine-derived cases, after 2 cases were reported in Upper and Lower Kohistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP].

In spite of tall claims by the government and several anti-polio drives, there has been no let-up in the polio cases across the country, as only yesterday [Fri 22 Nov 2019] 5 cases were reported in Sindh and KP. These 2 provinces are among the worst-affected regions, witnessing a spike over the recent months.

Poliovirus was found in the sample of a girl child in Tehsil Pattan of Kohistan. Her samples were sent to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad on [27 Oct 2019]. Similarly, the same virus was found in a 5-year-old girl in Tehsil Dasu of Upper Kohistan.

5 cases in Sindh and KP
On Friday [22 Nov 2019], 3 cases were recorded in Sindh and 2 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The 1st case was a 36-month-old female from Sakran in Shaheed Benazirabad, Sindh. She had received 3 doses of routine immunisation and 7 doses of supplementary immunisation.

The 2nd case was a 12-year-old male from Karachi's Keamari Town. He had received 3 doses of routine immunisation and 7 doses of supplementary immunisation. The 3rd case was a 3-month-old female from Lakki Marwat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. She had received no polio drops.

The 4th case was a 30-month-old female from Kotri in Jamshoro, Sindh. It is not clear whether she received any doses of the polio vaccine. The 5th case was a 10-month-male from Wazir in Bannu, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His immunisation record was incomplete.

According to an emergency operation centre (EOC) for polio: "Lakki Marwat and Bannu have become high-risk districts for polio cases in 2019, as 15 and 24 polio cases were reported in the districts, respectively. Polio cases from Lower and Upper Kohistan have been reported for the 1st time this year [2019]."

This week, the Gates Foundation pledged USD 1.08 billion and, along with other development partner organisations and governments, the meeting received total pledges worth USD 2.6 billion, including USD 160 million announced by Dr Mirza on behalf of Pakistan to eradicate polio in the world.

Polio remains endemic only in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The number of wild poliovirus cases stood at 77 in Pakistan and at 19 in Afghanistan as of [29 Oct 2019]. The corresponding figures during the same period last year [2018] were 6 for Pakistan and 19 for Afghanistan. However, the authorities show resolve, again vowing to enhance their efforts.

"We have conveyed to the international donors that we are developing consensus among all provinces to enhance our vaccination campaign with a new strategy. We need to give new confidence to the entire team, as we had controlled polio virus in the past, and we can do it again."

[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa): 2 new cases
Date: Sat 23 Nov 2019

https://www.urdupoint.com/en/pakistan/nih-confirms-two-new-cases-from-lakki-marwat-769245.html


The infuriated polio virus has left 2 more children disabled for life as National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad on Saturday [23 Nov 2019] notified new polio cases from Lakki Marwat and district Bannu, taking the total case count to 66 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the current year [2019] so far.

One wild poliovirus has been isolated from the stool sample of a 3-month-old female of union council Beistkhel, Tehsil Sarai Naurang district, Lakki Marwat and 10-month-old male resident of UC JaniKhel Tehsil Wazir, district Bannu.

The epidemiological study of the children shows that the female child from Lakki Marwat was zero dose for essential immunization, and her SIAs history is under investigation, while the male child had [one dose] of essential immunization, and his SIAs history is under investigation.

In his comment on reporting of new polio cases from Lakki Marwat and district Bannu, coordinator EOC Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Abdul Baist said it was a matter of grave concern and indeed a sad day that 2 more children are left disabled by poliovirus.

He said it was unfortunate that polio cases have jumped to 66 in the province with 18 cases from Lakki Marwat and 50 from Bannu division only.

Despite the fact that vaccine is available to prevent children from the disease, parents were not vaccinating their children due to misconceptions and were totally responsible for the disability of the children.

He said the virus is "on fire" in southern districts of the province, especially in Bannu division, and is circulating in the environment, hitting any unvaccinated or immune-compromised child.

He added that the only viable solution of the problem is to vaccinate the child in every campaign, as only repeated doses can protect the child from permanent disability and stop virus circulation in the environment.

Abdul Basit appealed to parent not to pay attention to propaganda and rumors, adding that polio vaccine is completely safe and does not cause any harm upon administration.

[4] Philippines: more information on recent cases
Date: Sat 23 Nov 2019

https://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2019/11/6-of-7-confirmed-polio-cases-are-from-mindanao-at-least-4-from-barmm/


The number of confirmed cases of poliovirus in Mindanao has risen to 6 out of 7 nationwide since the re-emergence of the highly infectious but preventable disease in September [2019]. At least 4 of the 6 are from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

The Department of Health (DOH) on Wednesday [20 Nov 2019] announced that the 3 new cases are children from Maguindanao, Cotabato City, and North Cotabato, 2 of them not vaccinated at all and the other without the 3rd dose.

The 1st confirmed case of polio, announced by the DOH on [19 Sep 2019], is a 3-year-old girl from Marogong in Lanao del Sur; the 2nd, announced on [20 Sep 2019], is a 5-year-old boy from Calamba, Laguna, and the 3rd, a 4-year-old girl from Datu Piang in Maguindanao, was announced on [28 Oct 2019].

The 4th confirmed case, also from Mindanao, was announced by health secretary Francisco Duque during a media interview on [5 Nov 2019]. But there were no details about the case except that the child afflicted is "from Mindanao."

Of the 6 confirmed cases in Mindanao, 4 are from the Bangsamoro region: 2 from Maguindanao, 1 from Lanao del Sur, and 1 from Cotabato City, which voted yes to inclusion in the BARMM in the January 2019 plebiscite but has yet to be formally turned over. The 2 others are from North Cotabato and from a still unnamed area in Mindanao.

The DOH on [19 Sep 2019] announced that polio was confirmed to have re-emerged 19 years after its eradication in the country. It said polio, an infectious disease that spreads rapidly, can cause paralysis and, on rare occasions, can be fatal and has no cure, but it can be prevented "with multiple doses of polio vaccine that have long been proven safe and effective."

"A single confirmed polio case of vaccine-derived polio virus type 2 (VDPV2) or 2 positive environmental samples that are genetically linked isolated in 2 different locations is considered an epidemic in a polio-free country," the DOH said on [19 Sep 2019].

On [20 Nov 2019], the DOH said samples from the 3 new cases that were sent to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan came out positive for poliovirus.

The 3 new cases -- a 2-year-old girl from Maguindanao, a one-year-old boy from Cotabato City, and a 4-year-old girl from North Cotabato -- were admitted to the Cotabato Regional Medical Center in Cotabato City.

The girl from Maguindanao (the DOH did not name the town) had fever and weakness in both legs; the boy from Cotabato City had fever, cough, and weakness in both legs; while the girl from North Cotabato had fever and weakness of the right leg, neck, and facial muscles.

The girl from Maguindanao and the boy from Cotabato City were not vaccinated with the polio vaccine, while the 3rd received incomplete doses, the DOH said.

The 1st confirmed case in Lanao del Sur and the 3rd confirmed case in Datu Piang were not vaccinated.

Health Secretary Duque said it is "unacceptable that more children are falling victim to this vaccine-preventable disease."

"We are more determined than ever to make sure that no child shall be missed during the next round of the Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio in Metro Manila and Mindanao," he said.

"We should not be satisfied with our children receiving only one or 2 doses of the polio vaccine. Let us ensure that they receive the complete doses of the vaccine to fully protect them from polio," Duque added. The oral polio vaccine (OPV) has 3 doses.

In October [2019], the DOH, in coordination with local government units and concerned national agencies, and with the support of World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, and other partners, launched "Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio" (synchronized polio vaccination) to protect every child under the age of 5 in areas at risk.

The Sabayang Patak in October [2019] reported a 96% coverage among children 0-59 months old from the 17 cities/municipality in the National Capital Region (NCR), the DOH said.

It added that Davao del Sur recorded a 92% coverage from its 10 city/municipalities, while Lanao del Sur reported an 85% coverage from 40 city/municipalities.

"We are reiterating to all parents and caregivers to have their 0-59-month-old children immunized with the polio vaccine from [25 Nov 2019 to 7 Dec 2019]," Duque said.

Bangsamoro chief minister Ahod "Al Haj Murad" Ebrahim had earlier called on residents in the BARMM to have their children vaccinated. In a videotaped message before the [14 Oct 2019] launch of the "Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio," Ebrahim urged residents to have their children under 5 vaccinated.

As Muslims, he said, their obligation is to take care of their health, including ensuring vaccination against preventable diseases. He cited a 2018 fatwa titled "The Legitimacy of Vaccination in Islamic Jurisprudence," where several ulama (religious leaders) said vaccination is halal (permissible) and urged Muslims to have their children vaccinated.

The synchronized vaccination campaign "aims to boost immunization coverage against polio by giving 3 doses of the oral polio vaccine to all children 5 years old and below."

The 1st round of the campaign was on [14-27 Oct 2019] in the National Capital Region and in Mindanao's Lanao del Sur, Davao City, and Davao del Sur; the 2nd [round] in all regions of Mindanao is from [25 Nov 2019] until [7 Dec 2019]; and the 3rd [round] is from [6-18 Jan 2020].

Vaccination of children under 5 was also held in Datu Piang, Maguindanao, on [4-8 Nov 2019], following the confirmation of the 3rd case coming from that town.

[In the past 2 days there have been a total of 7 newly confirmed cases reported from Pakistan: 3 in Sindh province and 4 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While both provinces have seen polio activity, the 2 most recently reported cases in Pakistan from Upper and Lower Kohistan are the 1st cases reported from these areas during 2019, signifying continued spread of the virus to new districts. The addition of these 7 newly confirmed cases will bring the total number of WPV1-associated cases reported from Pakistan with dates of onset this year (2019) to 93. In addition, there have been 9 cVDPV2-associated cases with date of onset in 2019 as well.

A good map showing districts and provinces of Pakistan can be found at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf. Kohistan is located in the northeast of the country sharing a border with the Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

As for the ongoing outbreak of cVDPV2 in the southern Mindanao region of the Philippines, the above report provided more details on the geographic locations of the cases and the suboptimal vaccination histories of the 3 newly confirmed cases.
