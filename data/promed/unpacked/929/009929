A Comment
---------
The situation with respect to the unexplained deaths in India does not
appear to be a good one. Some medical staff members appear to be fleeing
their patients, which itself is not a sign that they could provide adequate
care even if they stayed. This reminds me of the so-called plague epidemic
in India some years back, in which medical personnel left the area in panic.
As for the etiologic agent being Sin Nombre virus, I don't think so. That
virus has never been shown to occur in India (or even outside North
America) and the vertebrate host of Sin Nombre virus, the deer mouse,
_Peromyscus maniculatus_, does not occur in India. As far as I know, the
only hantavirus known to occur in India is Thottapalayam virus and it has
not been shown to cause disease in humans. Further, the only evidence for
multiple person-to-person transmissions of a hantavirus has been with Andes
virus, in South America.
This Indian guess is almost certainly a misdiagnosis, a missed "shot in the
dark," so to speak. If medical personnel are leaving the area; the signs of
illness are not compatible with those associated with hantavirus
infections; Sin Nombre virus is being provisionally considered as the
etiologic agent; no agent has been clearly defined; cerebral malaria has
not been ruled out; and everyone has a different hypothesis, the situation
could not be worse: anarchic. It would be a distinct improvement if someone
on the ground in the affected area knew what they were doing.

[Sin Nombre virus is the virus without a name, so the diagnosis could have
an etymological basis at least. - Mod.CP
