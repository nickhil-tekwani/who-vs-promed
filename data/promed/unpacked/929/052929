SHOOTING THE MESSENGER
**********************
Date: Wed, 23 Jul 1997 10:55:05 -0700
From: ProMED-mail <promed@usa.healthnet.org>
Jack Woodall only posted one message yesterday and look what came of it!

Late last night I was checking to see what had come in for moderation (that
is the correct word) and what I found surprised me: letters of support for
ProMED-mail regarding the posting Jack had sent out about suitability of
information and whether ProMED-mail should or should not be posting certain
"information". I hadn't even seen the originals at that time; now I have.
Given that it was Sophocles who said "None love the messenger who brings bad
news." and Shakespeare who said "The first bringer of unwelcome news hath but
a losing office.", who am I to jump in?
Here are most of the messages we received (some abstracted; one was unclear
as to which side the writer was taking, so I have not included it). One in
support of repression of information, the rest apparently in favor of ProMED-
mail policy. No point in belaboring this further. Thanks to all the people
who took time to send us messages.

ProMED-mail is absolutely correct in its reasoning concerning the reporting
of incidents, including the withholding of names when requested. Peer review
will take care of any inaccuracies in early reports. This valuable service
must not be stifled.

I support the current position of ProMed-mail as detailed in the moderator's
[Jack Woodall's] response. While I sympathize with the posted message,
retrospective case-controls are generally difficult, always biased, and are
at best, only moderately suggestive when done well. Unfortunately, that has
to be good enough for most of us. Ill people, and those close to them, tend
to ascribe their illness to causes. And while this only adds to the burden
of bias, some times they are right.

I dont understand the comments re: pro-med. This 'tip-off; came from
Reuters, not ProMED-mail.

I totally support your reply to J. Weinberg. I find Weinberg's letter
appalling and his motivations suspect, considering the fact that the UK was
documented to have tried to cover up an _E. coli_ outbreak, with this outbreak
leading to perhaps unnecessary deaths, as the contaminated products continued
to be sold long past the time when they COULD have been pulled from the
shelves if the UK officials had not been involved in a covert attempt to
cover up the outbreak.
If only ProMED had known about the prior _E. coli_ outbreak sooner...
I think the UK officials have already cast serious doubts, by their actions,
on the trustiworthiness and timeliness of their announcement of outbreaks. I
truly am grateful that ProMED does pass on nonofficial announcements of
outbreaks because, as we are all aware by now, if we waited until the
officials to announce, in some instances it may be too late to effectively
control a possible epidemic.

I cannot for the life of me imagine that "media interest" could conceivably
foil a scientific inquiry into the cause of an _E. coli_ outbreak. How
exactly would this work? Could you please provide some explanation?
Your suggestion that part of ProMED-mail's purpose is to "entertain its
subscribers" is offensive.

As I see it, the advantages and disadvantages [of anonymous postings]
followed by possible solutions:
Advantages:
1) Increase public knowledge and understanding
2) Possibly decrease risk and exposure to those that otherwise would be
unaware
3) Freer information of "transparency of information" tends to hold decision
makers more accountable
Disadvantages:
1) May compromise investigation efforts
2) May provide an means of promulgating false allegations
3) May cause false alarms from well intentioned individuals that don't
understand what they are observing.
4) If not controlled could be a means of furthering malicious intentions or
vendettas.
Possible solutions (one or all):
1) Limit on-line comments of anonymous contributors to strictly facts.
Allow no subjectivity, interpretation or comment on the facts.
2) Establish a policy of not promulgating a single anonymous "tip"
unless/until other anonymous contributors submit the same facts.
(Note: This could be foiled by collaboration amongst anonymous mischief
makers.)
3) Verifying facts independently before release.

I think it is an inevitable consequence of transmitting information that the
information may not end up where it is supposed to end up, or it is
intercepted and used for a purpose other than that for which it was intended.
I presume ProMED-mail does not vet (excuse the pun) its subscribers or
restrict their subscription services to professionals in the particular
field. [We do not; we encourage everyone interested to subscribe - Mod.JW]
How can ProMED-mail do that if indeed they wanted to? Accordingly, any
information transmitted on the net is inevitably public domain and
therefore can be used by anyone for innumerable purposes.
ProMED-mail is invaluable in what I do (monitor exotic plant and animal
diseases). Without it, we would be reacting to an incursion when it happens.
With ProMED-mail, we might be anticipating the outbreak before it happens.

I support the ProMED-mail statement. In some instances, there should be some
mechanism to get rumored or early info to the national public health
authorities with priority, perhaps, before general posting. Guidelines
should exist for these situations. The ProMED-mail service continues to be
outstanding, and we thank you and the monitors and editors for running it so
well.

"A good Story...", I agree with you. I don't see how ProMED-mail could be
blamed for a failed PHS investigation.

In response to the unattributed report posted by ProMED-mail, I have only
this to say in support of the posting: When dealing with an outbreak and
human lives, 'tis better to act anonymously and proactively than officially
and retroactively. The math is quite simple.

Karen Corson, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA

I stand behind ProMED-mail here, I think they posted responsibly. Further,
it is a pity that there are people who are behind times, and try to censor
their employees, making it a necessity for ProMED-mail to post anonymous
messages from time to time.
I don't know how things are done in the UK, but here in the USA we often are
faced with doing case-controls under intense media pressure. Finding proper
study subjects is an inherent problem in case-control studies and is usually
difficult. Media interest would have been, and is usually, an issue. (Not
always negative either.)
This is no longer the dark ages, you can't blame ProMED-mail for the media.
The media are after all a double-edged sword. Let's not let science get in
the way of human well-being.

And I don't think we really have any proof [that a public health study may
fail as the result of a notice on ProMED-mail], other than one person's
opinion.
I'd say continue as in the past until we have proof that ProMED-mail is
really causing a problem.
