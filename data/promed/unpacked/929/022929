A flock of chickens from an Orkney farm has been culled in Scotland's 1st serious case of bird flu since 2016. A 6-mile (10 km) control zone has been set up on the island of Sanday. Thirty-nine free-range laying chickens died of bird flu, and the 11 remaining birds in the affected flock were put down.

The controls include restrictions on the movement of poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure, and restrictions on bird gatherings.

Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said the risk to human health from the H5N8 Avian Influenza was very low.

Bird keepers have been urged to comply with an order to house birds that came into effect on 14 Dec 2020.

The last case of the H5N8 strain was found in a dead peregrine falcon in Dumfries and Galloway 4 years ago. Other less serious strains have been detected since then.

Ms Voas said, "We have already made clear that all bird keepers -- whether major businesses or small keepers with just a few birds -- must ensure that their biosecurity is up to scratch to protect their birds from disease and prevent any contact between their birds and wild birds.

"Keepers who are concerned about the health or welfare of their flocks should seek veterinary advice immediately. Your private vet or local Animal and Plant Health Agency office will also be able to provide practical advice on keeping your birds safe from infection.

"Any dead wild swans, geese, ducks, or gulls; falcons or other birds of prey; or 5 or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location should be reported to the Defra dead wild bird helpline."

She added that avian influenzas pose a very low food-safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products including eggs.

Because of the number of cases in Europe and in England, the risk of bird flu is currently judged to be very high for wild birds, high for poultry where there is poor biosecurity, and medium for poultry with protection measures in place.

A number of swans were recently found dead near the Hampshire coast and on the Isle of Wight, and there were culls in Warwickshire and Worcestershire.

Earlier cases have included 2 farms in Norfolk, East Anglia, and a wildlife centre in Gloucestershire. All 10 500 turkeys at a farm in North Yorkshire were culled following an outbreak.

Rural Affairs Minister Mairi Gougeon said Scottish cases were not "unexpected" given the cases in wild and captive birds elsewhere in the UK. "We ask that the public remain vigilant and report any findings of dead wild birds," she added.

NFU Scotland animal health policy manager Penny Middleton described it as "disappointing."

"It is now a legal requirement for all bird keepers, whether they have one hen in the back garden or a large poultry business, to keep their birds indoors and to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of avian influenza and keep out the disease," she said. "It's crucial that everyone remains vigilant and reports any signs of disease -- both in domestic birds and in wild birds -- at the earliest opportunity."

[A statement confirming the identity of the casual pathogen has been published on 18 Dec 2020 by the local Orcadian, citing an official announcement: "A flock of birds from a farm on Sanday has tested positive for H5N8 avian influenza. In order to limit the further spread of disease, appropriate restrictions have been imposed on the premises and any identified contact premises" (https://www.orcadian.co.uk/bird-flu-confirmed-in-orkney/). - Mod.AS]

The UK has recorded a 2nd outbreak of bird flu in a matter of days, after Defra today [Tue 15 Dec 2020] confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and captive birds at a premises in Derbyshire. Avian influenza, of the H5N8 subtype, has today (15 Dec 2020) been confirmed at a premises near Willington, Derbyshire. A 3 km [1.9 mi] protection zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] surveillance zone have been put in place around to limit the risk of the disease spreading, Defra said.

It comes after highly pathogenic bird flu was confirmed in captive birds at a non-poultry premises in Worcestershire on Sunday [13 Dec 2020].

The news comes as mandatory housing measures were rolled out across the UK from yesterday [Mon 14 Dec 2020].

It is now a legal requirement for all farmers and poultry keepers to keep their birds indoors following a string of outbreaks. They will need to follow strict biosecurity measures to limit the spread of avian influenza and eradicate the disease.

The risk of incursion of bird flu is "very high" for wild birds, "medium" for poultry with high biosecurity, and "high" for poultry with poor biosecurity.

A joint statement from Britain's 3 chief veterinary officers (CVOs) said, "Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from 14 Dec 2020 onwards, you will be legally required to keep your birds indoors. We have not taken this decision lightly, but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease."

Just last week, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza were confirmed at 2 turkey farms in Norfolk.

[Since late November 2020, HPAI H5N8 has been reported to affect poultry and/or captive non-poultry birds as well as wild birds in numerous European countries. This includes France, Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Slovenia, Croatia, and Poland. HPAI H5N8 has also been repeatedly reported from Israel, situated on main flyways of wild birds, migrating in the autumn months from their nesting grounds in Europe and Asia and to the wintering grounds in Africa.

Subscribers are referred to Mod.CRD's commentary in 20201214.8018047. The abstract of an overview paper, cited in the said commentary, follows:

"Between 15 Aug and 7 Dec 2020, 561 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 15 EU/EEA countries and UK in wild birds, poultry, and captive birds, with Germany (n=370), Denmark (n=65), and the Netherlands (n=57) being the most affected countries. The majority of the detections have been reported in wild birds (n=510), primarily in barnacle goose, greylag goose, and Eurasian wigeon. Raptors have also been detected infected, particularly common buzzard. The majority of the birds had been found dead or moribund; however, there are also reports of HPAI virus infection in apparently healthy ducks or geese.

A total of 43 HPAI outbreaks were notified in poultry, with signs of avian influenza infection being observed in at least 33 outbreaks; the most likely source of infection was indirect contact with wild birds. A total of 3 HPAI virus subtypes, A(H5N8) (n=518), A(H5N5) (n=17), and A(H5N1) (n=6), and 4 different genotypes were identified, suggesting the occurrence of multiple virus introductions into Europe. The reassortant A(H5N1) virus identified in EU/EEA countries has acquired gene segments from low-pathogenic viruses and is not related to A(H5N1) viruses of e.g., clade 2.3.2.1c causing human infections outside of Europe.

As the autumn migration of wild waterbirds to their wintering areas in Europe continues, and given the expected local movements of these birds, there is still a high risk of introduction and further spread of HPAI A(H5) viruses within Europe. The risk of virus spread from wild birds to poultry is high, and Member States should enforce in "high risk areas" of their territories the measures provided for in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1136. Detection of outbreaks in breeder farms in Denmark, the Netherlands, and United Kingdom highlight also the risk of introduction via contaminated materials (bedding/straw) and equipment. Maintaining high and sustainable surveillance and biosecurity, particularly in high-risk areas, is of utmost importance. Two human cases due to zoonotic A(H5N1) and A(H9N2) avian influenza virus infection were reported during the reporting period. The risk for the general population as well as travel-related imported human cases are assessed as very low."
