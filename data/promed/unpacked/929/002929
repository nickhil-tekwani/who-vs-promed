A Texas Department of Health spokesperson reports that 89 cases disease
caused by group A _Streptococcus_ sp., of which 57 cases were invasive,
have been reported in the state since December 1, 1997. Eighteen patients
have died, most due to necrotizing fasciitis or toxic shock syndrome.
Cases have occurred in several regions including Bexar County (San Antonio
vicinity) and Ft. Worth. Normally, Texas expects approximately 7 deaths
per year due to invasive streptococcal infections.
State epidemiologists have indicated that the cases are consistent with
typical seasonal patterns of streptococcal disease, but are occurring at
2-3 times the normal rate of 3.5 cases / 100,000 population. The US
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has sent additional epidemiologists to
help study the outbreak.
