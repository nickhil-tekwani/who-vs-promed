EU adopts two-tiered danger list over BSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Toby Helm in Brussels and David Brown
BRITAIN and six other European Union countries have been put on a BSE
"danger list" under controversial plans announced by Brussels yesterday.
The others are the Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland,
Portugal and France, all of which have admitted to cases of BSE in cattle
born and bred there. The remaining eight EU member states will effectively
be declared "BSE free". They will not have to enforce the tough meat hygiene
rules already in force in this country because any cases of BSE confirmed by
their vets have occurred in imported animals.
In a move which raised the political spectre of a double-tier among member
states - in defiance of the EU's self-proclaimed policy of equality for all
- Germany, Austria, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Greece and Spain would
be able to apply for exemptions from the requirements.
This would effectively give them BSE-free status, even though there are
fears among many veterinary experts that the true number of BSE cases has
been grossly under-reported on the Continent. The proposals form part of a
new regional approach by the European Commission to dealing with mad cow
disease.
The abandonment of an EU-wide strategy follows heavy pressure from Germany,
which has pushed for "BSE-free" status before it will consider voting for
any easing of the worldwide ban on British beef exports. The move is seen as
a trade-off to placate German farmers and consumer groups.
The plans accompanied a decision by Brussels to postpone until next year the
full imposition of hygiene rules for meat, including a ban on beef on the
bone, which Britain has insisted should be adopted across the whole of the
EU immediately.
Irish officials in Brussels said the new scheme could have a devastating
effect on their country's beef exports. "We will be classed officially as a
danger zone which is hardly great marketing," said a source.
Critics of the scheme also said it would reduce the willingness of countries
to reveal their first cases of BSE. British officials in Brussels said the
Government was considering supporting the regional approach to the meat
hygiene rules in the hope that it would help to accelerate progress towards
lifting the ban.

My comments:
Maybe "Hope springs eternal......" -- but don't hold your breath! As
previous stated, none of this is remotely connected with science.
