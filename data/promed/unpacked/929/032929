[Since July 2006, media reports from the Shirakskaya region of Armenia,
describing a disease in bovines characterised mainly by stomatitis and
suspected to be foot and mouth disease (FMD), have been repeatedly denied.
In view of the clinical picture and the persistence of the phenomenon, the
authorities might consider checking for other potential etiologies within
the differential diagnosis. Bluetongue, for one. - Mod.AS]
