More cattle have been infected with anthrax in Georgia in the past 2
months, an expert from the Tbilisi Infectious Diseases Center, Nikoloz
Chevchuvadze, told journalists. He said 30 people were infected with
the disease in the reporting period.

"The disease is also spreading in the regions densely populated by
Azerbaijanis. Anthrax-infected persons from Dmanisi, Sagarejo,
Marneuli and Gardabani came to us. Ten Azerbaijanis have been infected
with anthrax. One more person was infected with this disease in the
Sabirkend village of Marneuli. A Georgian died of anthrax 10-15 days
ago," he said.

He also said that prophylactic measures were being taken to combat
anthrax.

[This newswire shows a significant increase in recent human cases. The
affected districts are south of Tbilisi and aligned along the border
with Armenia and Azerbaijan, so I expect those exposed are likely to
be of Azerbaijani extraction.

It would be helpful if bovine as well as human cases were to be
reported. A more aggressive attitude toward the livestock risk and
vaccinated annually in targeted risk areas would probably result in
the human cases disappearing. Reactive vaccination means always being
behind the problem and not ahead of it, a very expensive and
inefficient policy.
