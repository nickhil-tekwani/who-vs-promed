On reading the ProMED-mail post entitled "Tick-borne encephalitis - USA (02): (NY) Powassan virus, alert," I found an interesting sentence in the report that I think needs further clarification.

The sentence reads: "Researchers at the Wadsworth Center found that the number of ticks with this deadly virus is increasing, and if someone has been bitten by a deer tick, there is a one in 20 chance that [the individual] has the fatal illness," which I think is clearly an overestimation.

In my humble opinion, there are not 5 percent of Powassan-infected ticks in the area, and, as far as I understand, the sentence refers to the probability that an infected tick transmits the infection. This seems to be overestimated or wrongly written, because (e.g.) Lyme disease rates in humans are clearly lower after the bite of a tick infected by such a widespread pathogen. Please note that some people in the area of New England are reporting about one weekly tick bite.

I am writing just with the purpose not to create an unnecessary alarm but to give adequate information about the very serious dangers of tick-transmitted pathogens.

[We thank Professor Estrada-Pena for his comment and offer the following clarification. In the 1st ProMED-mail report (Tick-borne encephalitis - USA: (NY) Powassan virus 20130717.1830332), it was stated that: "Throughout the study, lab analyses performed at Wadsworth Center's Arbovirus Laboratories found deer tick virus in black-legged ticks. Areas east of the Hudson River had the highest concentration of infected adult ticks, on the order of 4-5 percent in Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties. Virginia opossums, striped skunks, and raccoons were among the animals found to transmit deer tick virus to feeding ticks. Laura Kramer, one of the paper's authors and a research scientist at the Wadsworth Center, notes: "Our findings are consistent with deer tick virus infection rates in people revealed in clinical tests by the New York State Department of Health. Of 14 individuals testing seropositive for deer tick virus, 10 were residents of Westchester, Putnam, or Dutchess counties. Another 2 were from Albany and Suffolk counties, areas with burgeoning black-legged tick populations. Adding to the problem: unlike Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis -- which take feeding black-legged ticks hours to transmit -- deer tick virus transmission can occur in just 15 minutes. This leaves very little grace period for removing ticks, and underscores the importance of vigilance in tick habitat."

We consider that the 4-5 percent figure refers only to the frequency of detection of Powassan virus in black-legged ticks and not to the frequency of transmission of infectious virus to humans, which is likely to be very much lower. We thank Prof Estrada-Pena for drawing attention to this matter. - Mods.DK/CP
