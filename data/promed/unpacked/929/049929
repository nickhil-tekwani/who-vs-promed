["Several animal species have demonstrated susceptibility to the virus through experimental infection, and in natural settings when in contact with infected humans. There is also evidence that infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural settings through contact, such as mink-to-mink transmission, and mink-to-cat transmission. Infection of animals with SARS-CoV-2 has implications for animal and human health, animal welfare, wildlife conservation, and biomedical research. However, not all species appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To date, findings from experimental infection studies show that poultry and cattle are not susceptible to infection. Up-to-date information on the susceptibility of different animal species can be found at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/EN_2_Factsheet_SARS-CoV-2_v8_final.pdf."
