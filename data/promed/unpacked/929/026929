Malawi dispatched blood and tissue samples to neighboring South Africa on
Friday to be tested for avian influenza after thousands of migratory birds
were found dead on a hill in the central Ntchisi district.
Agriculture officials expressed alarm after local villagers started
scooping up the dead fork-tailed drongos -- known locally as namzenze -- to
eat earlier this week in the district about 200km east of the capital,
Lilongwe.
"Someone alerted police that people are feasting on mysterious manna from
heaven," said Wilfred Lipita, director of livestock and animal health in
the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security. "We sent officials to
caution the people not to eat them, since they may have the avian flu which
has proved deadly to humans in other countries."
The H5N1 strain of bird flu has ravaged poultry stocks across Asia since
2003, killing or forcing the slaughter of more than 160 billion birds. It
has also killed at least 71 people. Health officials fear the virus could
spark a pandemic if it mutates into a form easily passed from human to human.

[Clearly, everyone is on the alert for avian influenza. We look forward to
hearing the official test results.
Although it is not unheard of for one particular avian species to be more
susceptible to the virus, it seems unlikely that only one type of bird in a
region would be affected. The description of "manna from heaven" makes me
wonder if the birds were literally falling out of the sky. If that were the
case I might be inclined to think about a metabolic toxin of some kind.
For those not familiar with the drongos, they are a common bird with black
feathers and distinctive red eyes. Although usually they are diurnal,
lights around buildings will prompt them to eating the moths attracted to
the light, well into the dark hours. A good picture can be found at :
