More ostriches will have to be culled in the Eastern Cape
---------------------------------------------------------
More than 2000 ostriches will have to be culled on 3 farms at
Graaff-Reinet, in the Eastern Cape, as a precaution against the spread of
avian flu, after birds on one of the farms contracted the disease.
The department of agriculture says the latest outbreak is probably a result
of an exchange of birds in the area. It has been monitoring one of the
farms for some time, and the ostriches on 2 neighboring farms will also be
killed as a precautionary measure.
The ostrich farming industry suffered a blow in August [2004], when the
virus was discovered on farms in the Grahamstown district and at Middleton,
near Somerset East. To prevent the flu from spreading, farms were cordoned
off, and nearly 24 000 ostriches, as well as some domestic birds, were
culled. Exports of ostrich products have been put on hold until the virus
is eradicated.
The department compensates farmers for all ostriches culled, but their
breeding stock is often irreplaceable.

[South Africa's last (3rd) follow up report on the highly pathogenic avian
influenza outbreak in ostriches was sent to the Office International des
Epizooties on 22 Oct 2004. (See
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_21.HTM#Sec2>. Until that date, 9
outbreaks had been recorded in the Eastern Cape, 6 of which were in The
Blue Crane Route Municipality area and 3 were in the Grahamstown
Municipality, about 160 km away. The total number of destroyed ostriches
reached 28 154.
Graaff-Reinet is situated more than 100 km north west of Somerset East. If
confirmed, this represents a significant further spread of the disease. -
