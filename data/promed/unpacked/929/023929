[This formal report is of interest as it does not mention the human
cases (4 hospitalised and 6 contacts presumably on oral antibiotics),
the 7 dead cattle (not one as above), 4 dead sheep/goats (zero
above), and one dead horse (agreed). Pavlodar is further than we
realized from Astana. In Astana's favour one must mention that all
too often reports to OIE in Paris are solely dependent on whatever
samples are submitted to the laboratory for confirmation
unaccompanied by any farm history. The lab report is all they know. - Mod.MHJ]
