AZERBAIJAN FEARS EPIDEMICS AFTER FLOODS
July 11, 1997

YEVLAX, Azerbaijan -- Floods have sent raw sewage flowing through dozens of
towns and villages in central Azerbaijan, prompting fears of epidemics.
Waist-deep water covered most main streets of this town of 75 000 people on
Friday, five days after rains subsided. It was reported that raw human
sewage was floating along the surface in many places and many residents
used homemade rafts and boats to collect fresh drinking water provided by
the local government.
Kamil Muratov, deputy administrative chief of Yevlax, 300 km west of the
former Soviet republic's capital, Baku, said: "We fear the sewage could
contaminate drinking water. We badly need disinfection materials and drugs."
Officials said they were caught off guard by the freak rains which swept
across usually arid desert and steppe regions. "This is the first time we
have faced a problem like this," said Muratov.
Many rural homes in the mostly Moslem country do not have indoor toilets,
increasing the problems with sewage flows. The risk of epidemics is
heightened by temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius (105 Fahrenheit).
Emergency workers and local residents frantically dug canals and tried to
pump the standing water out of the town.
The government has sent in 25 fire engines with special pumping equipment
from places including Baku.
Most people in central Azerbaijan are poor and the area is a haven for some
of the hundreds of thousands of destitute refugees who have fled the
country's nearly decade-long conflict with Armenia over the disputed region
of Nagorno-Karabakh.
