Denmark will cull its entire herd of up to 17 million mink after a mutation of the coronavirus found in the animals spread to humans, posing risk to any possible future vaccine, the prime minister said on Wednesday [4 Nov 2020].

Outbreaks at mink farms have persisted in the Nordic country, [which shares with China the top of the world's mink industry], despite repeated efforts to cull infected herds since June [2020].

Health authorities found virus strains in humans and in mink that showed decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the efficacy of future vaccines, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said at a press conference.

"The mutated virus in mink may pose a risk to the effectiveness of a future vaccine," she said.

Minks have also been culled in the Netherlands and Spain after finding infections.

Denmark's health minister said around half of 783 infected Danes in Northern Denmark, home to a large number of mink farms, had been infected with a virus strain stemming from the farms. Authorities had registered 5 cases of the new strain on mink farms and 12 cases in humans.

The mink herd in Denmark totals between 15 million and 17 million, authorities said.

[The above statement by the Danish prime minister, "Health authorities found virus strains in humans and in mink that showed decreased sensitivity against antibodies, potentially lowering the efficacy of future vaccines" is in need of clarification in scientific terms, including the sequencing results and any other studies undertaken (some of this information is provided in the commentary of Mod.EP, below). The statements that "around half of 783 infected Danes in Northern Denmark, home to a large number of mink farms, had been infected with a virus strain stemming from the farms" and, on the other hand, the authorities "registered 5 cases of the new strain on mink farms and 12 cases in humans" are also in need of clarification.

Such information is of significance beyond Denmark; minks of the same species (_Neovison vison_, "American mink") are farmed in dozens of countries on at least 3 continents. The world's largest mink producer is China, closely followed by Denmark.

COVID-19 in farmed minks has been reported to the OIE from 5 countries so far: the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, USA, and Sweden. The disease was suspected also in Italy, where, in August 2020, the "molecular test results" of 2 samples (a carcass swab and a faecal sample) out of 555 tested samples were found "positive on low level." Later tests (totaling 569 samples: 306 in September and 263 in October 2020) were all negative. (The letter with the said information, issued by IZS Lombardy and Emilia Romagna, dated 26 Oct 2020, is available in Italian at https://www.lav.it/cpanelav/js/ckeditor/kcfinder/upload/files/files/2020.10.26%20Risposta%20IZSLER.pdf). - Mod.AS]

[There are 1186 mink farms in Denmark with 15 million to 17 million animals. One of the mink-related clusters, cluster 5, shows reduced susceptibility in vitro to reconvalescent sera from patients recovered from COVID-19. The decision to cull all mink in Denmark is taken because of a concern that the continued transmission between mink and humans will result in SARS-CoV-2 variants with a reduced susceptibility to the vaccines now in late-stage trials. The question is whether the same is happening in other countries raising mink.

Denmark (population 5.5 million) tests approximately 70 000 people every day, and the new cases have fluctuated around 1000 a day for the past week; 14% of positive cases are sequenced. - Mod.EP
