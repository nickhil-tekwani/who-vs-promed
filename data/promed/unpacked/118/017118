WHO: Two more Ebola cases in Guinea
-------------------------------------
2 new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea and 6 more deaths as of last evening [1 May 2014] were reported today by the World Health Organization (WHO). That brings the cumulative total to 226, with 149 deaths.

Of 210 cases tested, 127 have been laboratory-confirmed; this includes 81 fatal cases. Another 44 cases with 34 deaths have been classified as probable, and 55 with 34 deaths have been classified as probable [sic - this is quite confusing. - Mod.JW].

Cases in healthcare workers stand at 25 with 18 confirmed, and deaths among this group are 16, with 11 of those in confirmed cases.

The geographic areas of Guinea with the most cases are Guekedou with 140 cases and 99 deaths, and Conakry, the capital, with 53 cases and 24 deaths. Tracing of contacts is continuing in these 2 areas.

The WHO states that because EVD's incubation period can be as long as 3 weeks, more cases are likely to be reported in coming weeks. It further notes that the recent availability of Ebola virus serology testing for use in patients with clinical disease but negative findings on polymerase chain reaction [PCR] tests may change the number of confirmed cases.
