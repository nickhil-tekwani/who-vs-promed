This is a letter from Irian Jaya (Indonesia part of New Guinea) Health
Provincial Officer concerning on the outbreaks in Irian Jaya and Papua New
Guinea.
Thank you for your quotation from ProMED-mail regarding the speculation
that the source of the Papua New Guinea [PNG epidemic was in Irian Jaya.
During the drought period (the forest fires started in September),
especially in August and September, there are reported 700 deaths in PNG
and around 400 in Irian Jaya. The missionaries in Lolat thought that they
have meningitis epidemics. After we send our team, together with a
researcher from NAMRU who is searching for new emerging diseases, we
determined that the problem was malaria. There is a large possibility that
at least 50% of the deaths in PNG and Irian Jaya are caused by malaria.
Highlands malaria is exploding not only on this New Guinea island; I heard
it is also occurring in Africa and South America, most probably due to
global warming.
The average temperature during the drought rises during the daytime 2
centigrade; but is down 3 degrees in the evening. However, the microclimate
where the mosquitoes rest (under leaves, near houses etc.) must be warmer
in the evening, making it possible for the sporozoites to mature. This had
enabled transmission in the highlands above 1700 meters, even up to 2100
meters above sea level that we know of.
We are gathering more information, and will submit a paper regarding this.
If what happened in PNG is malaria; this happened in all the highlands in
this island; thus this is not a disease crossing from one country to
another. We have an increase of malaria in our part of the highlands border
starting August 97, but only a few deaths. If this is something else, we
are afraid it will reach our part of the island soon. We are sending a team
to Okyop, the nearest village to the Telefomin areas.

I am a physician formerly working in Jayawijaya, Irian Jaya. Right now I am
working as a resident in Internal Medicine Dept., Bandung, Indonesia.
In the last 4 months, since there was no rain for more than 6 months, many
crops failed to be harvested. So this has spread hunger in a vast area and
claimed the lives of more than 400 Jayawijaya inhabitants. The government,
missionaries and Indonesian people have put much effort in sending out
food and supplies, but due to limited air traffic and harshness of the
environment, not much can be distributed at one time, although huge
funding has been raised.
Many disease and strange stories [have come from this [situation, but it
is difficult to know for sure what disease we are dealing with, because
death reports are given orally and most deaths were not seen by the nurse
or doctors. Lab examinations often are incomplete [as elsewhere.
[Previous postings on human mortality in Papua New Guinea, which shares an
island with Irian Jaya (Indonesia) indicated an etiology of cerebral
malaria. Those posting the messages suggested that malaria might have been
brought to P.N.G. from Irian Jaya and asked how far the affected villages
in P.N.G. are from the border. - Mod.CHC
Lolat, Weawen and Kabianggama are far from the Irian-Papua border. It will
take about a month of full walking days. Different villages have different
problems so Lolat's problems may not be the same as another village which
is only a distance of 1 day walk. The spectrum of disease and food
availability are variable, [and mostly depend on the geography, altitude
and tribes.
