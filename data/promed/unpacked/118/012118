Incursion of Tomato torrado virus in Hungary
--------------------------------------------
In early October 2007, a tomato plant (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) showing
unusual symptoms was observed in a commercial glasshouse in the county of
Csongrad, south eastern Hungary. Symptoms were initially characterized by
yellow blotches at the base of the leaflets, which later developed into
necrotic spots, giving a burnt-like appearance to the plant. These symptoms
resembled those that have recently been described in association with
Tomato torrado virus (ToTV), a newly described virus detected in Spain and
Poland.

Laboratory analysis (DAS-ELISA [double antibody sandwich-enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay], RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction], dot-blot hybridization) of one leaf sample confirmed the
presence of ToTV. Other tomato viruses such as _Potato virus Y_, _Tomato
mosaic virus_, _Tomato spotted wilt virus_, and _Pepino mosaic virus_ were
not detected. The identification of ToTV was confirmed by another
laboratory in Spain (Instituto Agroforestal Mediterraneo, Universidad
Politecnica de Valencia).

The source of this infection was unknown. Tomato seeds originated from the
Netherlands but the possible role of seeds in disease transmission has not
been clarified. It is suspected that the disease is mainly transmitted by
_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_.

In Hungary, no official measures were taken as the ToTV infection was
detected at the end of the growing season and all tomato plants were
destroyed as part of routine practice. Since this outbreak, no new
infection has been observed at this place of production, and biological
control has been applied to maintain whitefly population density at a low
level. A national survey will be conducted to determine the current status
of ToTV in Hungary.

[ToTV is a new virus, which appears to be spreading. Symptoms of leaf
necrosis affect the photosynthetic potential of the host and therefore may
result in considerable yield loss. ToTV is suspected to be transmitted by
whiteflies, and _T. vaporariorum_ has recently been confirmed as an
efficient vector.

Phylogenetic analyses showed that the virus is related to, but distinct
from, viruses belonging to the genera _Sequivirus_, _Sadwavirus_, and
_Cheravirus_ in the proposed order of the Picornavirales. Another new virus
related to ToTV, Tomato marchitez virus (ToMarV), has recently been found
in Mexico. ToMarV and ToTV both share unique features that clearly
distinguish them from other plant picorna-like viruses. These viruses are
likely to represent a new plant virus genus for which the name Torradovirus
was recently proposed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses
(ICTV).
