[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is 4 180 303, with reports of cases by 216 countries and territories worldwide. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 98.0% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA, with more than 1.36 million confirmed cases, now represents 32.7% of the global cases of COVID-19. A global total of 283 859 deaths have been reported, with 279 226 (98.4%) outside mainland China.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Spain is number 2, and the UK is number 3, followed by Italy, Russia, France, Germany, Brazil, Turkey, and Iran as number 10. China is now number 11. The UK has now moved to 3rd place with Italy going into 4th place in terms of cumulative case numbers. The USA reported the highest number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (20 329), followed by Russia (11 012), followed by Brazil (6638) and the UK reporting the 4th-highest 24-hour newly confirmed cases (3923). - Mod.MPP]

[3] Hypertension and ACE inhibitors and ARBs: WHO
Date: Thu 7 May 2020

COVID-19 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Concerns exist that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase susceptibility to coronavirus SARS CoV-2 (the viral agent that causes the disease COVID-19) and the likelihood of severe COVID-19 illness. /1 These concerns are based on considerations of biological plausibility, /2 and the observation that there is an overrepresentation of patients with hypertension and other cardiovascular comorbidities among patients with COVID-19 who have poor outcomes. /3 Millions of people around the world are on treatment with ACE-Is and ARBs for hypertension, heart failure, coronary artery disease, or kidney disease. Speculation about worse outcomes among patients on these medications during the COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread anxiety among patients and their care providers. On the other hand, the harms of indiscriminate withdrawal of these medications on cardiovascular outcomes are well documented. /4 There is also widespread speculation about the potential benefits of ACE-Is and ARBs, based on biological plausibility arguments and animal data and small clinical studies on patients with other viral respiratory infections. /5

This brief summarizes the current evidence on the impact of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers on severe acute respiratory illness due to SARS CoV-2.

Methods
-------
A rapid review was carried out using Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from [1 Jan 2003] to [24 Apr 2020] as well as the World Health Organization database of COVID-19 publications, https://clinicaltrials.gov, and https://www.medrxiv.org from inception to [17 Apr 2020] using terms for COVID-19, SARS virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor antagonists. Additional citations were identified from hand-searching reference lists. Studies in all languages were included. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale.

Review of the evidence
----------------------
The rapid review identified 11 observational studies, /6-16 8 of which were conducted in China, /8-10, 12-16 along with single studies from Italy, /11 the United Kingdom, /7 and the United States. /6 Nearly all studies included only patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19. No studies were found that were designed to directly assess whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs increase the risk of acquiring COVID-19. After adjustment for confounders, history of ACE inhibitor or ARB use was not found to be associated with increased severity of COVID-19 illness. There were no studies that address the potential benefits and harms of initiating ACE inhibitors or ARBs as treatment for patients with COVID-19.

Conclusion
There is low-certainty evidence that patients on long-term therapy with ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not at higher risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19.

[4] China, South Korea: clusters of local transmission
A. Overview
Date: Mon 11 May 2020 05:49 GMT

"It's not over until it's over."
That was South Korean President Moon Jae-in, speaking Sunday [10 May 2020] after a new cluster of coronavirus [COVID-19] cases emerged in the country's capital Seoul, sparking fear of a 2nd wave of infections in the East Asian country. South Korea was among the 1st places to deal with a major coronavirus epidemic and seemed to be on track to loosen restrictions, after weeks of social distancing measures and careful surveillance. But the new cluster seems to have put an end to that, for now, with Moon warning his people "we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention."

China too, is introducing renewed restrictions after 2 cities reported new cases of the virus. Shulan, in Jilin province in the country's far northeast, has been put under lockdown, following 11 newly confirmed cases. Jilin borders both Russia and North Korea, and concerns have previously been raised over imported cases from overseas causing a renewed outbreak. More alarming are the new cluster of infections in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where cases of the novel coronavirus were 1st detected late last year [2019]. Wuhan was the 1st city in the world to enter into lockdown, only returning to relative normality late last month [April 2020] after 76-days.

On Monday [11 May 2020], city officials said 5 new cases had been confirmed in the city, none of which were imported from overseas. While that is a far cry from the figures at the beginning of the crisis, or those being reported daily across much of western Europe and the United States right now, the apparent ability of the virus to continue spreading undetected -- especially in a city as intensely surveilled and restricted as Wuhan -- will lead to concerns about the viability of reopening.

Mi Feng, spokesman for China's National Health Commission, on Sunday [10 May 2020] urged people to "stay alert and step up personal protection against the virus." He added that the new clusters were a reminder to avoid social gatherings and seek medical advice or testing should anyone exhibit virus symptoms.

Before the latest cases, the number of new infections in both China and South Korea had slowed to a trickle, with local transmission appearing to be halted. While questions can be raised over the accuracy of China's numbers, or the certainty anyone can have that all cases have been detected and contained in a country so large, South Korea's response has been hailed as one of the best globally, aided in part by the country's relatively small size and easily-controlled borders.

The latest cases may yet turn out to be a blip that will be contained, but that 2 countries which appeared to be on top of matters are again reporting domestic transmissions should be majorly concerning. Observers only need look at Singapore -- which in the beginning of April [2020] had less than 2000 cases, and now has more than 23 000 -- as to the potential risks of relaxing too soon and assuming the battle is won when it's only just begun. The city state is ramping up contact tracing, restrictions on movement, and even deploying robot dogs to encourage social distancing as it tries to get its outbreak under control.

Will any lessons from these countries be learned in the West, where countries are several weeks behind in their outbreaks, but many governments are already champing at the bit to relax lockdowns, despite sky-high infection rates?

Recent history suggests not. Western governments lagged in their response to the virus as it spread through Asia, despite clear evidence of the potential for a global pandemic. Asian experience and advice was also ignored on face masks until months into the pandemic -- a recent study by scientists in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom is only the latest to confirm that such coverings drastically reduce infection rates.

The new infections in China and South Korea also risk prompting a nihilistic response. If countries that appear to be on top of the disease cannot contain it, what can a nation with thousands of daily cases hope to do? But this is arguably the wrong takeaway -- these countries had the worst outbreaks in the world in February [2020], but managed to get them under control. That they are seeing new cases is a lesson about the risks of relaxing too soon, not a reason to give up the fight entirely.

Nor is the message out of Asia all grim. Viet Nam and Thailand are discussing the potential creation of a travel corridor, so confident are they that their domestic outbreaks are contained. New Zealand and Australia have already agreed to do the same -- though not for several months.

And Hong Kong, which successfully reined in a 2nd wave of the virus when it seemed like the city might go the way of Singapore, has gone 21 days with no local infections, raising the possibility of being declared virus free later this month [May 2020].

It's not over until it's over. But it will be over, eventually. What Asia's experience is showing is that this will require continued vigilance, and a lot of patience.

[It's very disconcerting to see the increase in cases in both China and South Korea simultaneously -- both countries that had reduced their daily case counts to less than 10 newly confirmed cases per day, and were showing a majority of cases to be importations during that period. In both instances, the lockdown restrictions had been lifted and some semblance of normalcy was beginning (albeit not completely as many venues were still closed in China, and to a lesser extent in South Korea. A key concern is that in the face of heightened awareness, in both countries there was most likely undetected asymptomatic transmission ongoing for an undetermined amount of time.

One hopes that both countries will be able to interrupt transmission in these new clusters and return to less than 10 cases per day being identified. - Mod.MPP]

Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus [COVID-19] outbreak in China, reported on Monday [11 May 2020] its 1st cluster of infections since a lockdown on the central Chinese city was lifted a month ago [April 2020], stoking concerns of a wider resurgence of the disease. The new infections sounded a note of caution amid efforts to ease coronavirus-related restrictions across China as businesses restart and individuals go back to work.

Wuhan reported 5 new confirmed cases, all of whom live in the same residential compound. One of them was the wife of an 89-year-old male patient reported a day earlier in the 1st confirmed case in the city in more than a month. "At present, the task of epidemic prevention and control in the city is still very heavy," said the Wuhan health authority in a statement. "We must resolutely contain the risk of a rebound."

All of the latest confirmed cases were previously classified as asymptomatic, people who test positive for the virus and are capable of infecting others but do not show clinical signs such as a fever. The number of asymptomatic cases in China is not known, as they only appear on the radar of health officials when they show up positive during tests conducted as part of contact tracing and health checks.

Hundreds of asymptomatic cases in Wuhan, which was released on [8 Apr 2020] from a months-long lockdown, are currently being monitored, according to the city's health authority.

The number of new cases reported in China since April [2020] has been small compared with the thousands confirmed each day in February [2020], thanks to a nationwide regime of screening, testing, and quarantine. The government said on Friday [8 May 2020] that China will gradually reopen cinemas, museums, and other recreational venues, though restrictions including mandatory reservations and a limit on numbers will be in place.

Shanghai has already reopened some night entertainment venues such as discotheques. Walt Disney Co on Monday [11 May 2020] reopened its Shanghai Disneyland park to a reduced number of visitors.

New outbreaks in China in the past 2 months have mainly developed in residential compounds or at hospitals.

The Wuhan cases helped push the overall new COVID-19 infections confirmed on [10 May 2020] to 17, the highest daily increase since [28 Apr 2020].

Northeastern Jilin province, which on Saturday [9 May 2020] reported a cluster of infections in one of its cities, Shulan, reported 3 additional local cases. Shulan has been marked a high-risk area, the only place in China currently with that designation. "We're now in a 'war-time' mode," said Jin Hua, mayor of Shulan, which until the weekend had reported no local cases for more than 70 days.

Shulan has imposed a lockdown on its 600 000 residents since the weekend, with just one member of a household being allowed out each day to buy necessities. One of the 3 cases confirmed in the Jilin province on [10 May 2020] was from Shulan. The other 2 were from the city of Jilin uncovered through contact tracing of people who were in contact with earlier Shulan cases.

Nearby Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces each reported one case, adding to worries about a resurgence of the outbreak in the region. A 70-year-old patient in Harbin, capital of Heilongjiang, had tested negative 7 times before results turned positive.

Of the new cases, 7 were so-called imported cases in the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia involving travellers from overseas.

[This media report presents more details on the 17 newly confirmed cases in China over the past 24 hours. It is interesting that the 5 newly confirmed cases in Wuhan all reside in the same housing block, reminiscent of the SARS-CoV outbreak (2003) in the Amoy Gardens housing block in Hong Kong but at a much smaller scale (hopefully). Other sobering information is that Wuhan Health Commission mentioned they are following "hundreds" of asymptomatic infected individuals... suggesting there is significant continued transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Wuhan. - Mod.MPP]

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea/south-korea-scrambles-to-contain-seoul-nightclub-coronavirus-outbreak-idUSKBN22N0DA


South Korean officials scrambled on Monday [11 May 2020] to contain a new coronavirus [COVID-19] outbreak, searching for thousands of people who may have been infected in a cluster of cases linked to nightclubs and bars in the densely populated capital city of Seoul. The Asian country has been lauded for its quick action on the pandemic, significantly reducing the rate of new infections in recent weeks, but a resurgence in case numbers has raised concerns the country could be entering a 2nd wave outbreak.

Officials reported 35 new infections across the country as of midnight on Sunday [10 May 2020], the 2nd consecutive day of new cases of that magnitude and the highest numbers in more than a month. 29 of those new cases were linked to an outbreak at a number of Seoul nightclubs and bars, many of them catering to members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community. That has raised complications for officials desperately trying to track those who might be infected in a nation where open homosexuality is often taboo and LGBTQ people still face discrimination, including job loss and hate speech.

Authorities have tested more than 2450 people who had patronised the night spots in the Itaewon neighbourhood, but were still trying to track down around 3000 more. Hundreds of other people who came in contact with clubgoers have also been tested. "Our top priority is to minimise the spread of the infections in the greater Seoul area," Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting with government officials on Monday [11 May 2020], calling on local governments to work with police to track down patrons. "We should quickly find and test them, and speed is key."

The outbreak has highlighted the potential unintended side effects of South Korea's invasive tracing methods and wide public disclosure of some patient information as part of its approach to tackling the coronavirus. Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho acknowledged concerns that individuals within the LGBTQ community could be outed against their will or face discrimination if they came forward. "We release the movement of confirmed patients to encourage anyone who might be exposed get tested voluntarily," he told a briefing. "We urge you to refrain from distributing patients' personal information or groundless rumours, which not only hurts them but can also be subject to punishment."

The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said 86 people have tested positive in connection with the Itaewon outbreak, which was made public on Friday [8 May 2020], including people who had travelled to the capital and subsequently returned home. Seoul mayor Park Won-soon pleaded with clubgoers to be tested, promising that personal information would be protected and warning that people caught evading testing could be fined. "If Seoul was penetrated, the nation is at risk," Park said, noting the city currently has around 700 of the nation's 10 909 cases, which include 256 deaths.

The spike in cases comes just as the South Korean government was easing some social distancing restrictions and reopening schools and businesses. Official data released on Monday [11 May 2020] showed exports and imports suffered a precipitous decline in the 1st 10 days of May [2020], underlining a bleak outlook for Asia's 4rth largest economy.

Seoul's education superintendent Cho Hee-yeon issued a statement proposing delaying the reopening of schools, which was scheduled to begin on Wednesday [13 May 2020], by one week in light of the new outbreak.

Technology firms Kakao Corp and Naver Corp suspended plans for employees to return to the office starting Monday [11 May 2020], after 2 cases linked to the club outbreaks were reported at IT firm TmaxSoft, company spokespersons said. TmaxSoft said on Friday [8 May 2020] it had shut down its office near Seoul and would test all employees for COVID-19.

The 69 cases reported by the KCDC over the past 48 hours were equivalent to the number of cases it recorded over the entire previous week.

Still, KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said while the outbreak was worrisome, it was not appropriate to call it a 2nd wave just yet. "The epidemic is ongoing," she said.

[The size of the at risk population currently under investigation appears to be approximately 5000 individuals. Unfortunately due to cultural reasons, many of the at risk group may not come forward for testing for fear of personal as well as professional security. The time period under investigation is from 26 Apr to 6 May 2020. Hopefully many of the countries rushing to lift lockdown restrictions while they are still confirming hundreds and in some cases thousands of new infections each day will reconsider rushing to lift restrictions prematurely, before it is realistic and feasible to do contact tracing of all newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 214. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 48 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported only 18 537 new cases (30.1% of the global newly reported cases), and 6830 deaths (80.3%) were recorded for this 24-hour period. It is important to mention that with the change of data source used for presenting the USA data (as mentioned in the Highlights section above), the USA has reported a total of -99 cases in the 24 hour period (in Sit Rep 111). In addition, Ecuador has reported -1480 cases in the same 24 hour period. Excluding the USA and Ecuador from the discussion and analysis, Brazil reported 55.1% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Peru at 17.9%, Mexico at 10.3%, and Canada at 7.4%.

The European region reported 25 608 new cases (41.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 1319 deaths (15.5%). Russia reported 43.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the UK 15.2%, Belarus 7.3%, Turkey 6.0%, and Italy 4.2%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 9706 new cases (15.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 130 deaths (1.5%). Pakistan reported 20.5% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 17.6%, Iran at 15.8%, Qatar at 11.6%, and Afghanistan at 8.6%.

The African region reported 2082 new cases (3.4% of the global newly reported cases) and 47 deaths (0.6%). South Africa reported 25.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana at 12.1%, Nigeria at 11.5%, Algeria at 9.1%, Guinea-Bissau at 6.4%, and Senegal at 4.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1139 new cases (1.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 21 deaths (0.25%). Singapore reported 66.1% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines at 12.9%, and Japan at 10.4%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 38.1%, Japan at 30.8%, Malaysia at 14.0%, and South Korea at 8.8%.

The South East Asia region reported 4506 new cases (7.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 152 deaths (1.8%). India reported 72.7% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh at 14.1% and Indonesia at 11.8%. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 51.7% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia represents 43.4%, the Maldives at 3.3%, and Sri Lanka at 1.0%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 10 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees too much weekend artifact and impact of reporting changes to draw any conclusions today.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkin's CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the John Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
