Insecticides and mosquito-borne disease
---------------------------------------
The primary means of controlling mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria
and filariasis is still by residual spraying with insecticides. Here we
show that insecticide-resistant _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes are
less likely to transmit filariasis than their insecticide-susceptible
counterparts. If this surprising finding extends to other combinations of
insect species, insecticide-resistance mechanisms and disease, it could
have widespread consequences for the control of vector-borne disease.

[This brief communication reports the finding that insecticide-resistant
(fenthion) _Culex quinquefasciatus_ express a certain esterase enzyme at
high levels in several tissues including the gut. Using quantitative PCR
(Polymerase Chain Reaction) the authors could demonstrate a strong negative
correlation between the amount of _Wuchereria bancrofti_ DNA found in the
mosquito and esterase level, showing convincingly that fenthion-resistant
_Culex quinquefasciatus_ have lower densities of _W. bancrofti_ compared to
fenthion-susceptible mosquitoes. - Mod.EP]
