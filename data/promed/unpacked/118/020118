Ag Dept Announces Meat Safety Actions
-------------------------------------
The secretary of agriculture on Thursday [28 Feb
2008] resisted calls from Democratic senators for
a complete ban on so-called downer cattle ­--
those unable to walk ­-- from entering the food
supply. In the wake of the largest beef recall in
U.S. history, Agriculture Secretary Edward T.
Schafer announced new steps to ensure the safety
of the country's meat supply, including more
random inspections of slaughterhouses and
immediate audits of plants that supply meat for federal programs.

But Schafer contended downer cattle could occasionally enter the food
supply safely, in accordance with USDA rules, after an additional
inspection by a veterinarian.

"The rules say if one goes down you call the veterinarian to make a
judgment," Schafer told a Senate hearing. "Today I'm convinced the
rules in place are such where we are protecting the supply," he said.
[Unfortunately, rules are useless when they are not followed, as in
the case under discussion. - Mod.JW]

Schafer ran into resistance from Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., chairman of
the Senate Appropriations agriculture subcommittee. "We cannot allow
a single downer cow to enter our food supply under any circumstances,"
Kohl insisted. He also urged Schafer to install cameras in
slaughterhouses and take other steps to ensure meat safety.

It was Schafer's 1st Capitol Hill appearance since the emergence of
video ­-- shot by the Humane Society of the United States ­-- showing
workers at Westland/Hallmark Meat Co. in Chino, CA, shoving and
kicking sick, crippled cattle, forcing them to stand by using electric
prods, forklifts and water hoses.

In response, the Agriculture Department shut down the plant and has
since ordered the recall of 143 million pounds of the company's beef
­-- the largest recall in U.S. history ­-- because the company didn't
prevent downer cattle from entering the food supply. Downers, those
too sick or injured to walk, pose a greater risk of illnesses such as
mad cow disease.

Schafer insisted his agency is taking the problem seriously and will
investigate fully. "It is extremely unlikely that the mishandled
animals pose a risk to human health," said Schafer. "We are going to
pursue these investigations wherever they lead and pursue whatever
corrective actions may be called for," he said.

Schafer's testimony came a day after the Humane Society sued USDA over
what it calls a loophole allowing downer cattle into the food supply.
In 2004, the USDA tightened regulations to prohibit the slaughter of
all "downer" cows after a case of mad cow disease was discovered in
Washington state. The lawsuit alleges that under last year's change,
cows that fell down after an initial veterinarian inspection but
appeared otherwise healthy were allowed to be slaughtered.

Schafer contended that in that situation downer cattle are supposed to
be inspected again by a veterinarian and then can be safely
slaughtered and consumed.

[2] Canada, 12th case
Date: Tue 26 Feb 2008

Canada Says Alberta Dairy Cow Is 12th Mad-Cow Case
--------------------------------------------------
Canada confirmed its 12th case of mad-cow disease
in an animal born about 5 years after the nation
banned some feed ingredients to halt the spread
of the brain-wasting illness. The sick animal was
a 6-year-old dairy cow from Alberta, the Canadian
Food Inspection Agency said today in a statement
on its website. Canada and the U.S. in 1997
banned the use of cattle feed containing
ground-up cattle tissue, which scientists say is
the way most animals contract the disease.

No part of the animal entered the human or animal
food systems, the agency said. A search is under
way to find the animal's herdmates at the time of
its birth and the path of infection, the CFIA said.

"The age and location of the animal are
consistent with previous cases detected in
Canada," the agency said in the statement. "It is
not expected the case should impact access to any
of Canada's current international markets for beef," the CFIA said.

The discovery comes 3 months after the U.S. lifted most of the
remaining restrictions on beef and cattle from Canada after
determining that the animals pose "minimal risk" for mad-cow disease,
clinically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. The U.S.
banned [Canadian] cattle and beef after Canada confirmed its 1st case
of BSE in May 2003.

Canada and the U.S. have been designated
"controlled- risk" nations for BSE by the
Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health,
which the U.S. has used as an argument for
restoration of meat trade with countries that
have limited imports of its beef. The case
announced today "will not affect Canada's risk status," the CFIA said.

The U.S. has had 3 confirmed mad-cow cases since
December 2003, including one in an animal born in
Canada [see commentary]. The CFIA said it
expects to detect "a small number of cases" as
Canada moves toward eliminating BSE from its herds.

Mad-cow disease has a fatal human form that has
been linked to more than 150 human deaths
worldwide, most of them in the U.K. beginning in
the late 1980s. Humans contract the ailment by
eating beef from infected animals.

The diseased cow will not affect a USDA rule that
allows Canadian cattle born after 1 Mar 1999 to
be exported to the U.S., said Rachel Iadicicco, a
spokeswoman for the USDA's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service. Research has shown
that a small number of animals born after 1999
are likely to be afflicted with the disease, she said.

The new BSE case is more evidence that Canada's preventative measures
aren't working, said Max Thornsberry, a Missouri veterinarian and
president of the Billings, MT-based Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal
Fund, United Stockgrowers of America, or R-Calf. He noted that the
infected animal is the 7th born after Canada's feed ban was implemented.

"USDA is ignoring science by dismissing the
empirical evidence that shows Canada's BSE
problem has worsened beyond anyone's
expectations, and Canada's cattle herd represents
a significant risk to the United States,"
Thornsberry said in a news release. The group
wants Congress to stop imports of Canadian cattle.

A spokesman for the U.S. National Cattlemen's
Beef Association said Canada's safety measures
are working and that a few cases of BSE are to be
expected. "The Canadian Food Inspection Agency
made it clear they expect to find a small number
of additional cases as both countries work toward
eradication," said Joe Schuele, a spokesman for the association in Denver.

[The 1st-ever BSE case in North America was
discovered in Canada (Alberta) in May 2003.
Canada initiated an intensive surveillance plan;
as of end February 2008, 12 additional indigenous
cases have been recorded there, including the
case detected in Washington state (see further), and the current case.

The 1st case diagnosed in the USA was a downer
Holstein cow, originally from Canada, slaughtered
in Washington State in December 2003.
Subsequently, 2 indigenous cases have been
discovered: in Texas (June 2005) and Alabama
(March 2006). It may be assumed that the actual
BSE prevalence in the USA is not lower than the Canadian one.

Measures to prevent BSE in the United States included banning the
feeding of most mammalian proteins to ruminants. This feed ban is the
most important measure to prevent the transmission of disease to
cattle. The main public health protective measure is the removal from
the human food supply of specified risk materials -- those tissues
where the BSE infective agent would be found if present. Among the
other measures -- banning from the human food chain non-ambulatory
disabled cattle ("downer cows") and animals with any clinical signs of
neurological disease or other abnormalities. Such measures require the
presence of a veterinary inspector and the performance of an
antemortem examination upon arrival in the slaughterhouse.

The absence of such examination of forwarded downer cows was one of
the serious failures discovered while investigating the recent
incident in Chino, CA [see ProMED post Beef recall - USA (04):
Nationwide 20080227.0799]. In this respect, readers are referred to
the following observations, included in the chapter "Non-ambulatory
(downer) cows" in the report of the international experts team which
was officially invited to investigate the first US-located (but
Canadian in origin) BSE case in December 2003:

1. It is true that non-ambulatory cattle (downer
cows) are more likely to be BSE infected than are
healthy slaughter cattle and therefore may pose a
greater risk to public and animal health. The
goals for measures related to these cattle must
be to (1) test them for surveillance purposes and
(2) prevent potentially infective tissues from
entering the food and feed chains. Given their
exclusion from supervised slaughter at inspected
slaughterhouses, this important subpopulation may
no longer be available for the BSE surveillance
programme at these locations. Therefore it is
imperative that the USDA take additional steps to
assure that facilitated pathways exist for dead
and non-ambulatory cattle to allow for collection
of samples and proper disposal of carcasses. This
most likely would involve expending resources to
assist with costs associated with sampling, transport and disposal.

2. In order to decrease the risk of these
potentially infected cattle entering the normal
slaughter process, supplemental measures to
encourage compliance must be in place. These may
range from financial incentives to a
strengthening of antemortem inspections to
identify questionable animals. To further prevent
these cattle from being brought into the normal
slaughter process, consideration may have to be
given to the random sampling of appropriate
subpopulations of aged cattle that have passed
antemortem inspection on presentation at slaughter plant.

3. Veterinary authorities must consider all
possibilities, including education of the farmers
in their role as producers of safe food, in order
to achieve maximal surveillance of this risk population.

[According to article 2.3.13 of OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code, member countries can be
regarded to have one of the 2 categories
"Negligible BSE risk" or "Controlled BSE risk"
provided they fulfilled the requirements detailed
in articles 2.3.13.3. and 2.3.13.4.,
respectively. If it cannot be demonstrated that
the country meets the requirements of one of the
said categories, the country is regarded to be of
"Undetermined BSE risk". The code addresses the
import requirements of animals and animal
products from such countries. Obviously, the
risks related to imports from countries with
'Undetermined BSE Risk' status are higher than
from countries of the other categories, and
accordingly import requirements from them may be
more demanding. For the detailed category
requirements and their respective international trade conditions, see
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_2.3.13.htm#article_2.3.13.2>.

During its 75th General Session, Paris, 22 May
2007, OIE's International Committee endorsed
Resolution No. XXIV "Recognition of the Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy Status of Member Countries"
(<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_statesb.htm?e1d6#Reso>).
According to the said resolution, Australia,
Argentina, New Zealand, Singapore and Uruguay
were recognised as countries with a 'negligible BSE risk.'

The following countries were recognised as
countries with a 'controlled BSE risk:' Brazil,
Canada, Chile, Switzerland, Taipei China and
United States of America. Iceland and Paraguay
were recognised as 'provisionally free' from BSE
in accordance with Chapter 2.3.13. of the Code
and Resolution XXVII of the 74th General Session,
to remain on the list published by the OIE until May 2008.

Later, 2 meetings of the OIE AD HOC GROUP FOR
EVALUATION OF COUNTRY STATUS FOR BSE IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMAL HEALTH
CODE were held in Paris, namely on 16­-20 July
2007 and 12­-14 September 2007. The following
countries have been recognised to belong to the
category "Negligible BSE risk": Finland, Iceland,
Norway and Sweden. The following countries were
found to have "Controlled BSE risk": Austria,
Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovak
Republic, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom.

The Group assessed 2 additional country dossiers which did not meet
the requirements, neither for 'negligible BSE risk' nor for
'controlled BSE risk.' These dossiers were referred back to the
corresponding countries.

For the detailed discussions on each of the applicants, subscribers
are referred to appendix VII (pages 55-108) of the REPORT OF THE
MEETING OF THE OIE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION FOR ANIMAL DISEASES, Paris,
