[The causative agent, according to the current report, is serotype 4. Since the start of the epizootic in Romania, reportedly on 24 Aug 2014, 85 outbreaks have been reported in 6 provinces; an administrative map of Romania is available at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ROMANIA_judete.jpg.

BTV-4 was apparently earlier reported to be rapidly spreading this summer [2014] in Greece, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavian republic (FYR) of Macedonia. The latter 2 countries submitted on 1 Sep 2014 their respective follow-up reports to the OIE, including interactive maps showing the new foci. The reports are available at:

FYR Macedonia: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15913;

Bulgaria: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15880.

The updated total outbreaks per species in the 4 countries since their respective dates of start are as follows:

The apparent morbidity rates in cattle (percentages) in the 4 countries are:
Greece - 1.2; Bulgaria - 2.1; FYR Macedonia - 1.3; Romania - 20.2.

The strikingly high BT morbidity in Romanian cattle, apparently caused by the same BTV-4 serotype which traditionally is known to cause clinical disease primarily in sheep, is puzzling.

In the absence of vaccination, losses -- primarily in sheep -- in all affected countries must be heavy. According to a media report from Bulgaria, dated 2 Sep 2014 citing the Ministry of Agriculture: "The number of sheep that had died of bluetongue stood at nearly 6500 towards 1 Sep 2014; the situation concerning goats and cattle was less alarming."
