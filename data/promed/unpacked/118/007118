The giant tick found in Drenthe last week has been confirmed as a _Hyalomma marginatum_, a species originating in tropical climates and previously confined to southern parts of Europe. The ticks, thought to be brought in by migrating birds, have striped legs and their body is almost twice the length of ticks normally found in the Netherlands. This can grow to around 2 cm [0.79 in] when they are engorged with blood. Unlike common ticks, the giant tick actively hunts its prey and can identify targets up to 9 m [30 ft] away. They have also been observed [following] their target for 10 minutes or more, walking or running a distance of up to 100 m [109 yd], according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The ticks are known to carry several diseases, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, but this tick was not a carrier, the public health institute RIVM said. The tick was, however, carrying bacteria that can cause spotted fever (_Rickettsia aeschlimannii_), which is rare but easily treated by antibiotics. Spotted fever was also found in ticks in Austria last year [2018]. The Drenthe tick is the 2nd _Hyalomma_ to be found in the Netherlands. One was identified in eastern Gelderland in early July [2019]. Examples of the ticks have been found in several other northern European countries, including Germany, where it is thought to have overwintered, and Sweden. Most have been found on livestock, primarily horses.

[It is fortunate that no pathogenic viruses were found in this tick. Although this was a single individual tick (apparently the 2nd) in the Netherlands this year (2019), given that it has been encountered sporadically in several European countries, it would not be surprising for it to be found again in the Netherlands in the future. Although this tick was found overwintering in Germany, it is thought not to have become established there yet.
