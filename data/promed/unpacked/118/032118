Pig die-offs observed in North Ossetia
-----------------------------------------
The outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) is continuing in North
Ossetia. Though, by now, more than 1600 pigs have been destroyed, the
epidemic has not been stopped and 369 animals have already succumbed
to ASF.

The 1st ASF cases in the territory of the republic were recorded in
June 2008. Wild boar were a vector of the disease. The affected
villages with pig mortality were located in the Prigorodny and
Lagirsky districts, as well as in the municipality of Redant, city of
Vladikavkaz-2.

On top of the 1600 pigs already destroyed, more than 9000 additional
pigs will have to be destroyed. The total domestic pig population of
the republic is about 115 000 head, located in private facilities and
farms.

During the summer of 2007, Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Agency of
Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] took preventive measures,
but they did not have the desired efficiency [Those measures must have
been undertaken in view of the reported ASF spread in [neighboring]
Georgia. - Mod.AS]
