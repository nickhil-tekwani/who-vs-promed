Newcastle disease has been found in dead birds in southern Chile, an
agriculture Ministry's veterinary official said on Monday [16 Jul
2007].
The government will strengthen surveillance of wild birds near the
city of Constitucion and take measures to prevent domestic birds from
being infected with the virus, the official said.
Last month [June 2007], 8 wild cormorants were found dead in the
coastal area of Constitucion.
Newcastle disease is a highly contagious respiratory virus mainly
carried by birds. The disease 1st broke out in 1926 in Indonesia's
Java island and England's Newcastle.

Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a paramyxovirus that is contagious
and fatal, so much so, that many birds die without showing any
clinical signs, and in some outbreaks, mortality has reached almost
100 per cent in unvaccinated flocks. NDV may even cause mortality in
vaccinated flocks.
The disease is transmitted through infected birds' droppings and
secretions from the nose, mouth, and eyes. NDV spreads rapidly among
birds kept in confinement, such as commercially raised chickens, and
spreads primarily through the bodily discharges of infected birds.
Clinical signs include: sneezing; gasping for air; nasal discharge;
coughing; greenish, watery diarrhea; nervousness; depression;
muscular tremors; drooping wings; twisting of head and neck;
circling; complete paralysis; decrease or cessation of egg production
and thin-shelled eggs; swelling of the tissues around the eyes and in
the neck; and sudden death.
There is no known treatment for the highly pathogenic form of
Newcastle disease virus, sometimes called exotic Newcastle disease or
END.
Diagnosis is often by swabs from the cloaca or trachea using ELISA or PCR.
The confirmation of this highly contagious disease could mean that
neighboring countries will slam their borders shut to protect their
poultry industries. It may mean some markets previously available as
export markets will no longer be available. This disease is one not
wanted by other countries or markets.

Assuming the dead birds with NDV are the 8 cormorants mentioned, which
are fish-eating river and seabirds that do not roost near poultry,
there is probably near zero risk of any interaction with poultry in
this case, therefore no justification for embargoing poultry from
Chile. - Mod.JW]
