[The location of both cases is on the coast, the Ghana case is very close
to the Togo border, but the case in Togo is actually closer to Benin. The
distances in this part of West Africa are not great, and much traffic
between Nigeria and Ghana runs through both Togo and Benin Republic. The
location can be seen with the original OIE (Office International des
Epizooties) report referenced above.
Since the volume of traffic between countries in West Africa is large and
national borders porous, it may be useful to look at the outbreaks in West
Africa holistically. In this case, the outbreak is still spreading within
Ghana and now to Togo. These current outbreaks may require us to revisit
the hypothesis that outbreaks occur mainly from December to March or April,
since it appears that new outbreaks are still occurring in West Africa.
In Nigeria, from where I am moderating this posting, outbreaks have tailed
off considerably; the last confirmed outbreak occurred in the north western
state of Zamfara at the end of April 2007. The experience in Nigeria
indicates a seasonal distribution centered on the cool and dusty harmattan
time from December to February. The outbreaks in Ghana and now Togo
represent a new wave of the epidemic, and we would not expect them to have
so strict a seasonal distribution, but it will be important to note their
progress through the rest of this year 2007 and next year 2008.
The international efforts in Ghana have not fully taken advantage of the
Nigerian resources, who have a considerable amount of expertise having
wrestled with well over 200 cases and whose National Veterinary Services
Laboratory consistently performs accurate diagnosis of H5N1, as confirmed
by the OIE reference laboratory in Padova. In that regard, the designation
of the Accra National Laboratory as an OIE Regional Laboratory for Avian
Influenza may be a mistake, considering that the report submitted by the
Ghanaians does not assert OIE Regional Laboratory status. A clarification
would be appreciated. - Mod.PC]
