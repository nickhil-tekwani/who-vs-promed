I find the comments by Dr. Rod Griffiths, West Midlands Director of Health,
as quoted by the BBC, outrageous. The hospital repeatedly [7 times used
instruments used last year in a Caesarean section on a woman who was later
found to be suffering from nvCJD. This is unacceptable, given what we think
we know about prions. The hospital itself is not named "for legal reasons",
which indicates someone thinks there are legal reasons not to name the
hospital. What, might I ask, are those legal reasons?
To top it all off, Dr. Griffiths speaks of ethical reasons to withhold
information regarding the "vanishingly small" risk to the women on whom the
potentially contaminated instruments subsequently were used. Whose ethics?
Seems the hospital, the responsible physicians and others, and the regional
health authority (represented by Dr. Griffiths) have an absolute
responsibility to inform those women they are at some risk, even if
vanishingly small. The approach they have used might sound thoughtful,
sensitive, and kindly but it is paternalistic. In fact, if ethical and
legal reasons are unclear then it is the absolute responsibility of the
professionals involved to provide all relevant information and thereby
allow the patients to decide for themselves what, if anything, to do and
how to act from now on.
Without their knowing their own potential condition, how can these women
take or avoid actions that might or would put others at risk, perhaps even
going so far as to avoid subsequent pregnancies? [or blood donations?
Dr. Griffiths says he does not know whether completely informing the
mothers is "the right thing to do" and the mothers "would worry" does not
set a reasonable precedent. Perhaps if an insurance company or two as well
as the regional government were dragged kicking and screaming into court
this withholding of information would cease. I wish I were a British barrister.

[Perhaps, the hospital fears they may be responsible for insuring the
women. Perhaps this would be the best approach the hospital could take. -

[ProMED-mail has received a number of similar e-mails from subscribers who
were upset at the posting noted by Dr. Calisher, above, in which
withholding potentially important information from patients was described
as being ethically justified. ProMED-mail does not condone as ethical the
withholding of such information from patients. - Man. Ed. DS
