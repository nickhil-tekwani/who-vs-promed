An exotic tick-borne disease, never seen before in Australian canines, has been found in a small number of sick dogs tested in Western Australia's far north Kimberley.

Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks, particularly common in tropical and sub-tropical regions, but this is the 1st time it has been confirmed in dogs that haven't been imported from another country.

The affected dogs, in Halls Creek and Kununurra, have been treated by a private veterinarian in the region. The bacteria, _Ehrlichia canis_, which causes the disease in dogs, was later confirmed through laboratory testing by the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness.

Department of Primary Industries chief veterinary officer Michelle Rodan said authorities were unsure how or when ehrlichiosis 1st arrived in the Kimberley.

"We haven't detected what the original source is ... any dog that entered Australia which is infected and has been bitten by a tick could be a source of the outbreak.

"Once it's in the tick population, it's very difficult to control. So the 1st stage is defining how widespread the distribution is and then in the interim trying to contain it to a region."

The flu-like signs of infection for dogs can include fever, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, and bleeding disorders, which can resemble other tick-borne diseases already present in northern WA, such as anaplasmosis. If left untreated, ehrlichiosis can be fatal to the dog.

The National Consultative Committee of Emergency Animal Diseases has met to discuss response measures.

Dr Rodan said while surveillance was being carried out to determine the distribution of the disease, DPIRD had introduced measures to control the movement of dogs out of the Kimberley.

"We've already been in contact with private vets to get some samples from dogs going through their clinics, to get a sense of how broadly spread it is, not only in the Kimberley but across the north of Australia."

"Any dogs moving out of the Kimberley region must be clinically healthy and have had a tick treatment applied, [and] DPIRD will require notification prior to movement of dogs outside of the region."

Dr Rodan said the high numbers of stray and wild dogs in the region could pose a challenge to controlling the spread of the disease.

"There has been some surveillance last year [2019] and in previous years that would lead us to think it's not being detected in the wild dog population, [but] wild dogs may become a source of infection if it continues to spread," she said. "To help prevent infection, owners should maintain dogs on a tick-control program."

Ehrlichiosis is a nationally notifiable disease under the Exotic Diseases of Animals Act 1993.

The disease cannot be directly passed from infected dogs to other dogs or humans. However, while infected dogs do not transmit ehrlichiosis to people, in rare cases, infected ticks may transmit the bacterial illness to people.

Key points:
- Ehrlichiosis is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks; it's been found in Australian dogs for the 1st time in the Kimberley.
- Signs of infection include fever, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, and bleeding disorders.
- Anyone who suspects their dog has the disease should contact their private vet, a DPIRD vet, or the Emergency Animal Disease hotline on 1800 675 888.

[Dogs with clinical signs of ehrlichiosis do not feel well. You may only notice them slowing down a little in the 1st week they are affected or perhaps off their food a little, especially if it is warm weather. The article described it as flu-like signs, which is about right. Check the dogs frequently for ticks. The ticks can be extremely tiny and still transmit the disease. Check crevasses in the ears, between the toes, around the rectum, underneath the front legs, and especially on the chest and between the shoulder blades and on the back. The dogs may have a hard time scratching these places. When you remove the tick, it may bleed more than you would expect. Be cautious how you remove the tick. Use a tick remover, or at least a pair of forceps (tweezers will even work). The point is, in removing the tick, you do not want to squish the tick between your fingers, even accidentally, and get the organism forced into you.

Treatment prescribed by your veterinarian is generally doxycycline. This is usually given with food, as it may cause stomach upset. Some dogs seem sensitive to it; others do not seem to be bothered by it. It is very important to follow the veterinarian's direction on when and how much to give your animals. Take care of an infected animal, and give them time to recover before putting them back to work. Some dogs can become quite anemic and feel really awful, so give your animal plenty of time to recover and rest.

Yes, humans can and do get this disease.

Signs and symptoms of ehrlichiosis in human beings typically begin within 1-2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. Tick bites are usually painless, and many people do not remember being bitten.

See your healthcare provider if you become ill after being bitten by a tick or spending time in grassy, brushy, wooded areas, or if your pet has the disease.

Early signs and symptoms (the 1st 5 days of illness) are usually mild or moderate and may include:
- fever, chills
- severe headache
- muscle aches
- nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite
- confusion
- rash (more common in children). The rash may develop about 5 days after the fever begins. The rash can also occur in adults. It will look like red splotches or pinpoint dots.

If antibiotic treatment is delayed, ehrlichiosis can sometimes cause severe illness. Early treatment can reduce your risk of developing severe illness.

Signs and symptoms of severe (late stage) illness can include:
- damage to the brain or nervous system (e.g., inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissue (called meningoencephalitis))
- respiratory failure
- uncontrolled bleeding
- organ failure
- death

Risk factors for severe illness:
- delayed antibiotic treatment
- age: being very young or very old
- weakened immune system (e.g., those receiving some cancer treatments, individuals with advanced HIV infection, people who have received organ transplants, or people taking certain medications)

If you believe you have come in contact with any tick-borne disease, your physician should be able to diagnosis it by a blood test and get you on the correct antibiotic for whichever tick disease you have encountered. In the case of ehrlichiosis, doxycycline is generally the recommended antibiotic.

Check yourself for ticks frequently if you are a hiker, camper, rancher, herder, or even someone who works in the area where these ticks have been found. Be sure you check under your arms, especially where tighter clothing is, such as around waist bands, and your head. You may need help to check your scalp.
