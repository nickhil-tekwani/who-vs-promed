The Livestock and Fishery Service of Kabupaten (municipality) Sidrap,
South Sulawesi, strengthened livestock traffic control from Sidrap
borders: Pinrang-Sidrap, Parepare-Sidrap, Wajo-Sidrap and
Soppeng-Sidrap to prevent disease introduction to Sidrap from other
areas, said Head of the Livestock and Fishery Service of Sidrap, HM
Abd Azis. So far, Azis and team are still investigating whether
thousands of chicken deaths in Sidrap were caused by bird flu virus.

The Livestock and Fishery Service of Sidrap up to now has recorded
about 1000 sudden chicken deaths. The highest numbers of deaths were
recorded from Kelurahan Kadidi.

Separately, from Kabupaten Pinrang, Head of Agriculture and Livestock
of Pinrang, H Syamsu Sulaiman stated that they had done disinfection
in entire sub-districts and depopulation of hundreds of bird flu
infected chickens. The Livestock Service also isolated the infected
areas, Sawitto, Tiroang, Paleteang, Mattiro Bulu, and Lanrisang.

Pinrang's Head of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health, Dr Elvi
Martina, said that bird flu diagnosis was done by clinical
observation, necropsy and rapid test. Negative results should be
re-checked by laboratory test in Maros (Veterinary Disease
Investigating Center). "But for the current outbreak in Pinrang, we
don't continue laboratory testing, because they all have tested
positive for bird flu," added Elvi.

Formerly, bird flu outbreaks in Pinrang were recorded in 2006 and
2007. No outbreaks were recorded in 2008 and 2009. Elvi said that in
order to state that an area is clear from bird flu requires zero cases
in 3 consecutive years, and then the area can be stated as free in the
4th year.

In Pinrang, Elvi mentioned that no special regional budget was
allocated for bird flu eradication and control. However, a routine
budget is provided for depopulation of infected chickens and suspected
chickens living within infected areas, as stated in Presidential
Instruction 2007. The regulation also mentioned compensation which
should be provided to affected farmers.

So far, the Livestock Service of Pinrang has recorded a total of 4094
chickens infected by bird flu. In detail, in Kecamatan Lanrisang are
2690 backyard and 400 broiler chickens; in Kecamatan Mattirobulu are
275 backyard chickens; in Kecamatan Watang Sawitto and Tiroang are 50
backyard chickens for each sub-district; and in Kecamatan Patampanua
are 625 layer chickens.

The Health Service has not observed [confirmed] any bird flu
transmission to humans in Pinrang, however 18 people are under
observation.

[In contrast to the above information on the absence of human cases,
the Indonesian daily "The Jakarta Post" reported on 29 Sep 2010 about
3 hospitalised patients suspected of avian influenza in South
Sulawesi; laboratory test results are awaited -- see ProMED archive
(55) below.

Indonesia and Egypt are the 2 countries where circulation of HPAI
virus H5N1 in animals and humans is continuing. The disease was
officially declared endemic by the Indonesian authorities in September
2006. It occurs in most parts of the country.

The high number of reported outbreaks each month is partially
explained by the implementation of the participatory disease
surveillance and response (PDSR) programme that targets village-type
poultry production systems (mainly backyard) and reports evidence of
virus circulation in the village environment. - Mod.AS]
