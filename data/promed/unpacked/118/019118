Schmallenberg virus: investigated samples and new evidence
----------------------------------------------------------
The Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis (IVI) has received, up to 2 Sep 2012, submissions from 78 farms in 19 different cantons related to notified abortions or foetal malformations. This included a total of 81 diagnosed animals: 44 cattle, 23 sheep, and 14 goats. So far, 4 malformed calves tested positive for the Schmallenberg virus [SBV].

Acute cases in adult cattle with diarrhea and fever have recently been reported from 113 farms, 106 of which tested positive for SBV. [The figures, as of 19 Aug 2012, were respectively 77 and 72]. The laboratory results have been based either on the detection of the virus or specific antibodies.

[The virus continues its spread in Switzerland. An updated map of its distribution is available at the source URL above. The spread in southward and eastward direction included also the eastern canton of Appenzell, on Austria's border.

[2] France: spread to Bretagne (Brittany)

Schmallenberg virus [SBV] spreading in France
---------------------------------------------
SBV has spread into Bretagne, a very important dairy region in north-western France.

Farmers saw their dairy cattle develop diarrhea, combined with a drop in milk production.

Test results confirmed SBV.

This event is not overly surprising; experts expected the virus to spread to other regions in Europe, including additional parts of the United Kingdom.

Until recently, Bretagne remained free from SBV.

[The FluTrackers.com webpage on SBV, edited and moderated by Gert van der Hoek (who is gratefully acknowledged for drawing our attention to the current development), is an excellent source of information on SBV epidemiology in Europe. The page includes a useful map of the SBV distribution in Europe; its update of 4 Sep 2012 is available at http://www.flutrackers.com/forum/showthread.php?t=183181.

FluTracker.com's information on the spread of SBV to Bretagne is based upon Web-agri (France) at http://tinyurl.com/bn7u9pg.

The spread of SBV in regions which remained free during the previous season, currently reported in Switzerland and parts of France, illuminates 2 issues of significance:
1. Animals exposed to SBV infection last year [2011] are immune; this includes a high percentage of the cattle, sheep, and goat populations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, probably Luxembourg, and certain populations in France and (south western) England.
2. The ruminant populations which escaped last year's infection, are susceptible.

To understand the epidemiology of SBV, a virus which clearly managed to overwinter in north western Europe, research efforts are much in need. This refers in particular to entomology.
