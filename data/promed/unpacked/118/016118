First report of _Geosmithia morbida_ and its insect vector (_Pityophthorus juglandis_) causing thousand cankers disease in Italy
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the USA, the association of a recently described fungal species, _Geosmithia morbida_, and its vector, _Pityophthorus juglandis_ (walnut twig beetle), is causing a severe and emerging disease of black walnut (_Juglans nigra_) and other _Juglans_ species or hybrids. This disease is called thousand cankers disease and until recently had not been reported from any other parts of the world.

At the end of November 2013, the NPPO of Italy informed EPPO of the first records of _G. morbida_ and _P. juglandis_ in Bressanvido (province of Vicenza, Veneto region) on a small number of _J. nigra_ trees. Identity was confirmed by laboratory analysis. The infected trees (about 15 years old) were part of a plantation. Leaf yellowing and wilting, twig and branch dieback were observed, as well as numerous small bark cankers developing around galleries made by _P. juglandis_. The disease was also detected on 80 year old _J. nigra_ trees in a private garden.

The origin of this outbreak is unknown. The most likely pathway is thought to be introduction of the insect vector on wood from the USA. The discovery of thousand cankers disease is considered by the NPPO as a serious threat to _J. nigra_, and possibly to _J. regia_. It is noted that during the last 90 years, numerous areas along the Po valley have been reforested with mixed tree species for wood production, in which _J. nigra_ is often present in varying proportions.

Systematic surveys will be conducted near the outbreak site to determine the extent of the infection. Random checks will also be carried out in _J. nigra_ plantations across the Veneto region. Studies will be conducted on the potential pathways of entry, in particular in sawmills where walnut wood is imported from the USA. Phytosanitary measures are being considered.

[Thousand cankers is considered a disease complex involving fungal species of genus _Geosmithia_ and possibly also _Fusarium_. It is spread by the walnut twig beetle (_Pityophthorus juglandis_; family _Curculionidae_, snout and bark beetles) with subsequent canker development around beetle galleries. This insect-fungus association is considered to represent a new and significant threat to walnut species (genus _Juglans_). The disease is now considered a serious threat to walnut species in Europe and, therefore, pathogen and vector have been added to the EPPO alert list.

_J. regia_ (European walnut) is the main species used for production of culinary walnuts. Black walnut and other species in the genus also have edible fruit which are eaten locally. Many of them are important forest species in their regions of origin and can be cultivated for commercial wood production.
