Clubroot in Saskatchewan
-------------------------
A serious canola disease has made its way into Saskatchewan. Tests
confirm clubroot has been found in 2 fields in the north-central part
of the province. SaskCanola's [Saskatchewan Canola Development
Commission] Brett Halstead says the exact location has not been
released.

"It is the choice of the landowner whether they disclose the actual
location. At this time, we don't have [their] agreement, but the
information is still relatively new. We wanted to get it out as soon
as possible because farmers are going to be making their seeding plans
and they will need to be more vigilant with their farming practises."

Clubroot ultimately leads to the death of the canola plant. Yield
losses are usually about half of the percentage of infected plants,
(for example, if 10 to 20 percent of plants are infected, yield losses
should be 5 to 10 percent). There are a few clubroot resistant canola
varieties.

Clubroot was discovered in central Alberta 8 years ago, but until now
had stayed out of Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan Clubroot Initiative
(SCI) was established in 2009 by SaskCanola, the Ministry of
Agriculture, and industry organizations. It promotes awareness and
identifies priorities for clubroot prevention and management.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora
brassicae_. It is a destructive soilborne disease, which affects
nearly all cultivated as well as many wild and weed members of the
cabbage family. It is found worldwide and is most damaging in
temperate regions and tropical highlands. The fungus enters root hairs
and wounded roots and multiplies rapidly, causing abnormal enlargement
of the underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots. Affected roots
often decay before the crop has matured. Plants are stunted and may
have discoloured leaves. Due to the distortion of the root, plants may
wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Decaying roots release many resting spores which can survive in the
soil for a decade or more in the absence of a susceptible host plant.
The disease can be spread with soil (for example on agricultural
machinery), farming activities (as mentioned above), and infected
plant debris. Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of
the spores and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to
fungicides. Raising soil pH by addition of lime has been shown to be
effective but is hardly practicable on large fields. Use of clean
planting material and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between
fields is essential.

The pathogen is composed of numerous pathotypes, which makes breeding
crop cultivars with durable resistance difficult (see link below). In
Alberta, several clubroot pathotypes have been reported.
