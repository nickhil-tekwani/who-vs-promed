Tests prove new bird flu cases in east India state
---------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests on dead birds have proven a new outbreak of the H5N1
bird flu virus in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, a state
government official said on Monday [15 Dec 2008].

"The laboratory test in Bhopal has confirmed the presence of the H5N1
virus in the dead birds," Sridhar Ghosh, the senior official in West
Bengal's Malda district, told Reuters.

Ghosh said the virus had been found in 3 dead birds tested in a
laboratory in the central Indian city of Bhopal.

Indian authorities are already culling hundreds of thousands of birds
in the northeastern state of Assam, where health authorities are also
monitoring about 100 people who had shown signs of the virus.

Those patients in Assam's Guwahati, the main city in the region, were
suffering from fever and respiratory infections, symptoms of the H5N1
bird flu virus in humans.

There have been no confirmed human cases of H5N1 among those patients
being monitored or at any other time in India.

Since the virus resurfaced in Asia in 2003, it has killed more than
200 people in a dozen countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.

Ghosh said state officials in West Bengal were told of the latest
positive tests on Monday [15 Dec 2008].

West Bengal officials said several hundred birds could have been
found dead but disputed local media reports that as many as 5000
birds were dead.

"We could start culling from tomorrow [16 Dec 2008] to contain the
outbreak," Ghosh said by telephone from Malda, 350 km (220 miles)
north of Kolkata.

The WHO has described an outbreak of bird flu in communist-ruled West
Bengal last January [2008], when more than 4 million birds were
culled, as the worst ever in India.

An outbreak of bird flu in poultry was also detected in Malda
district in March [2008], resulting in the culling of more than 50
000 birds. Authorities later said in May that the virus had been
stamped out in the area.

Culling operations, which began in Guwahati in Assam last month
[November 2008] had been expanded to nearby Meghalaya state as a
precaution, authorities said on Sunday [14 Dec 2008].

More chickens die, flu panic spreads in Malda
---------------------------------------------
Fresh poultry deaths were reported from the Englishbazar area of
Malda, sparking fears that it was a bird flu attack. But the district
animal resources department (ARD) refused to confirm the deaths.

At least 200 chickens reportedly died over the past 24 hours at
Budhia village in the Englishbazar block. The district administration
has already sent samples from the dead birds from Satgharia village
-- where birds had died on Saturday [13 Dec 2008] -- to the Bhopal
laboratory to check for the H5N1 virus.

A high-level meeting will be held on Monday [15 Dec 2008] to prepare
for a possible avian influenza outbreak. However, even before a
battle plan to tackle the possible viral attack has been chalked out,
the number game is already on in full swing. The animal resources
department did not confirm if chickens had actually died at Budhia.
Deputy director of ARD NK Shit said, "We have sent 2 birds from
Satgharia tests, but our team has not got any report of abnormal bird
death from elsewhere."

District magistrate Sridhar Ghosh said, "ARD has collected the
samples of dead birds and sent these to Bhopal. We hope to get the
report by Tuesday." He conceded that [ARD] was not being able to
confirm if many birds had died. It was learnt that the additional
district magistrate had himself visited the affected villages to
confirm the deaths.

At Budhia, villagers like Bahadur Munshi, Firoz Sultan, and Yakub Ali
have reported the deaths of chickens in last 48 hours. Kayema Biwi
claimed, "About 27 chickens have died in the last 24 hours." Gram
panchayat member Hasnara herself is one of the worst sufferers, as
she lost 22 birds overnight.

True to their claims, the villagers were seen burying dead birds,
while remains of dead birds were scattered here and there. Hasnara
said, "On Saturday [13 Dec 2008], about 250 birds died, while at
least 100 died in our panchayat area alone. I've informed the block
officials repeatedly, but to no avail."

Although official confirmation is awaited, there is every chance it
is a bird flu outbreak, said locals. ARD experts said that a place
that had witnessed a bird flu outbreak had a high chance of seeing
another viral attack in a year. Earlier this year [2008], about 23
500 birds were culled in Englishbazar after a bird flu outbreak,
while about 87 000 were culled in Chanchol subdivision.

On Saturday [13 Dec 2008], Satgharia villagers had complained that
200-odd birds had died over the 3 previous days. Among other
symptoms, villagers reported that the birds were becoming drowsy
before dying. A villager said that the poultry-owners had first
suspected it to be Ranikhet disease [an Indian term for Newcastle
disease], which attacks at the beginning of winter. But when reports
of bird deaths started trickling in from other villages, they
suspected it was bird flu.
