National Geographic warned last week [12 - 18 Jun 2017] that the spread of the disease through serpent species, including America's iconic rattlesnakes, is potentially disastrous as the reptiles keep vermin such as rats and mice in check.

News of SFD [Snake fungal disease] cases in the UK was announced today [19 Jun 2017] 24 hours after BBC's Countryfile screened a special report on conservation efforts being made to save the nation's remaining 100 000 adders.

There are an estimated 300 000 grass snakes across Britain but there are serious conservation concerns and the species has protection under the Wildlife and Countryside Act as well as being a priority creature under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. The discovery of domestic snake with SFD will only heighten conservation concerns.

Details of the disease's presence in the UK and Europe were announced today in a new collaborative study led by the Zoological Society of London and published in the journal, Scientific Reports.

SFD is caused by a fungus called _Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola_ and, prior to the study, had only been found in central and eastern USA, but an analysis of samples collected from wild snakes in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic between 2010-2016 has confirmed the presence of the pathogen.

Scientists say that although the disease poses no known risk to humans or livestock, further research is vital. Lead author and wildlife veterinarian Dr Lydia Franklinos said: "Our team at ZSL found evidence of SFD in grass snakes from the UK and a single dice snake from the Czech Republic. The analysis found that the fungus strains from Europe are different to those previously identified in North America - suggesting that rather than being introduced across the Atlantic, or vice versa, the disease could have been present below the radar in European snakes for some time."

"Of all terrestrial vertebrate wildlife, we probably know least about health conditions that affect reptiles such as snakes, so this study represents an important milestone and one that will hopefully encourage greater focus in understanding the threats facing these animals."

Fellow author Dr Jeffrey Lorch, a microbiologist with the USGS National Wildlife Health Center explained why it is essential to find out more about the disease.

He said: "The fungus that causes SFD is already known to occur across the eastern half of the U.S. and infect over 20 species of snakes. Comparing how SFD affects wild snakes on different continents may help us pinpoint the factors causing the disease to emerge and help managers identify mitigation strategies."

Fungal diseases have already proven catastrophic to wildlife. Bats and amphibians have been stricken by the pathogens, with reports one strain was being spread by turning frogs into "sex zombies".

The pathogen has been making the mating calls of infected males more attractive to females so they can pick up and perpetuate the disease.

Snake fungal disease (SFD) is an emerging disease of wild snakes that had been circumscribed to North America. This report shows that the fungus is also present in Europe. It is noteworthy that the study not only found the fungus, but also skin lesions associated with infection. In some cases, these lesions were severe enough to be considered the likely cause of death.
