The reduction in diphtheria incidence is due to vaccination, but the same
tendency in hepatitis A incidence is not due to that. At least this is a
correct argument for the Pskovian area (oblast).
Diphtheria is the great problem in our territory. Its rate exceeds that in
Russia:

from previous post - Mod.JW
The majority of cases were registered in Pskov and Pskov-district
territory:

Total Pskov
118 442 579 232 59

Pskov-district
16 88 98 46 9
(Data from Pskov oblast Center of state
Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Surveillance)
The mass vaccination campaign began in 1994. The main problem was adult
vaccination, because it was needed exactly to restore the vaccination in
this age group. During this period approaches to adult vaccination have
been changed. In early 1997 they were standardized.
The serological monitoring data at the end 1997 carried out by Pskov oblast
Center of state Sanitary-and-Epidemiological Surveillance corroborates the
existence of protective level diphtheria antitoxin antibody content in
investigated vaccinated children (97.2%) and adults (99.4%). The number of
diphtheria cases for first 3 months of 1998 is 6 (all adults).
The tendency for reduction in hepatitis A incidence is marked.
Years 1995 1996 1997
----------------------------------------
Total 1116 710 394
But hepatitis A vaccination has never been done in Pskovian oblast
territory. The reduction in hepatitis A incidence [must be due to other
causes.
