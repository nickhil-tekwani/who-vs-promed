MERS virus claims 2nd Jeddah victim
-----------------------------------
A 55-year-old Jeddah man suffering from renal failure died of complications from Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) at a Madinah hospital. His death brings the number of patients worldwide killed by the virus to 49 [51].

43 people have died of MERS in Saudi Arabia. The total number of cases in the Kingdom is 84.

Earlier this week [week of 26 Aug 2013], the Health Ministry reported that a 38-year-old Saudi, who was suffering from severe pneumonia and respiratory failure had died.

The victim in Madinah was a Saudi originally from Jeddah, making it the 2nd reported MERS case from the city. A 2-year-old child died early in July [2013].

The man was also suffering from chronic renal failure and was undergoing treatment at the ICU at King Fahd Hospital.

According to the WHO, 94 laboratory-confirmed [the global total of confirmed cases is now 108, see WHO update below - Mod.MPP] and 16 probable cases of MERS have been reported to the organization since April 2012. Other affected countries in the Middle East include Jordan, UAE and Qatar.

[While this newswire is a bit confusing due to outdated information on the global total, the new information here is the death of one of the 1st confirmed cases in Madinah (and reported in the WHO update below, and in the 30 Aug 2013 ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (63): Saudi Arabia, new cases, WHO 20130829.1911345). This newly reported death raises the global total of deaths to 51, out of 108 laboratory-confirmed infections with the MERS-CoV.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update - 30 Aug 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional 4 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in Saudi Arabia.

The 1st patient is a 55-year-old man with an underlying medical condition from Medina who became ill on [17 Aug 2013] and is currently hospitalised.

The 2nd patient is a 38-year-old man with an underlying medical condition from Hafar al-Batin who became ill on [8 Aug 2013] and died on [17 Aug 2013].

The 3rd and the 4th cases are family contacts of the 2nd patient. Both the cases, a 16-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, tested positive for the MERS-CoV virus. They are both healthy and do not have any symptoms of illness.

Globally, from September 2012 to date [30 Aug 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 108 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 50 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[According to the press release announcing the death of the 55-year-old male from Medina (Madinah), the individual was from Jeddah. It is not clear from the newswire information if the individual was just visiting Medina or if the individual was living in Medina but originally was from Jeddah. If the former, information on the dates of travel would be important in establishing possible locations of transmission of the MERS-CoV.

In the 30 Aug 2013 ProMED-mail post announcing these 4 newly confirmed infections with MERS-CoV there was mention of possible intra-hospital contact between the 55-year-old Saudi male (whose death was announced today in the Gulf Times report above) in Medina (Madinah), and the 59-year-old Qatari male with a history of onset of illness while travelling in Saudi Arabia. More information on the investigations into possible routes of contact/infection would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP
