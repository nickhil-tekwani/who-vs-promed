11 tribals have died of a mysterious disease in one month in
Jharkhand's Latehar district, health officials said.

The toll reached 11 with 2 fresh deaths being reported from Champa
village in Mahuadand in the district today [20 Sep 2009], civil
surgeon of the district, Aron Tigga said.

Pradip Waski, an official of the disease surveillance programme, told
reporters that they were trying to learn more about the mysterious
disease and would take preventive measures after a surveillance team
examines the affected persons of the tribe and those living in the
nearby areas.

The civil surgeon said the district administration would accept the
help of the Centre if the situation demands it.

Giving details of the symptoms of the disease, he said the affected
persons took ill suddenly, suffered stomach problems, and the skin
turn yellow.

[The information is very scarce, but diarrhea and jaundice could be
signs of hepatitis A or leptospirosis among the most likely
diagnoses. If fever was present, malaria is another possibility.
Laboratory tests and more clinical information should solve the
puzzle.
