USA (Alaska): More Cruise Ship Passengers Succumb to Viral Gastroenteritis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A gastrointestinal virus has infected about 24 passengers on a Holland
America Cruise Lines ship from Seattle. Cruise line officials wouldn't say
how many passengers on the liner "Amsterdam" fell ill, but SuAnn Jenkinson of
the state epidemiology lab in Anchorage estimated the number at 25, including
a crew member.
Jenkinson had been in contact with the cruise line's chief medical officer.
She said the number of cases didn't reach the 3 percent threshold that
triggers a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] response.
Rose Abello, vice president of public relations for Seattle-based Holland
America Cruise Lines, said on Thursday that an undisclosed number of ill
passengers were removed from the ship at stops in Sitka and Juneau and
flown home at the cruise line's expense.
In addition to removing infected passengers, Abello said, crew members have
been cleaning the ship regularly and asking passengers to wash their hands
often. The cruise line established a procedure for reacting to viral
infections after a series of Norwalk-like virus outbreaks in 2002 on board
Holland America ships in the Caribbean, Abello said. Abello said the virus
has not been identified, so she could not say whether the outbreak was due
to norovirus infection.
Just last week, the Star Princess, a Princess Cruises ship sailing between
Seattle and Alaska, had an outbreak of stomach illness among its passengers
and crew. A total of 112 passengers and 14 crew members vomited and had
diarrhea [resulting from norovirus infection] during the ship's 7-day
cruise, Princess Cruises spokesman Tom Dow said. No one was hospitalized.
The first report of the recent illness came within 24 hours after the ship
left the Seattle port, Abello said. It usually takes 48 to 72 hours after
infection for symptoms to appear, so it is likely the virus was carried on
board by an infected passenger, she said.
Holland America's "Amsterdam" was one of several ships that experienced
infections in 2002 during Caribbean cruises. Outbreaks also occurred on the
Holland America ship Statendam and the Disney cruise ship Magic.

[The outbreaks of sudden-onset gastroenteritis observed on cruise ships have
usually been shown to be a consequence of norovirus infection, frequently
introduced by an infected passenger or crew member. Norovirus infection is a
disconcerting illness which rapidly runs its course without serious outcome.
In general, the problem is now well-recognized and the cruise line
managements have procedures in place to contain the spread of infection. -
