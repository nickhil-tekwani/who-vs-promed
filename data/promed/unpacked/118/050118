[From a previous post: Plague Suspected In Jefferson County Prairie
Dog Die-Off Leads To Health Warning . . . Pet owners who live close
to rodent populations should dust their pets with flea powder,
following the instructions on the label.]

The use of "flea powder" is considerably outdated in our "war on fleas."

Not only is it hazardous to the person applying it (inhalation of the
powder as it is dusted on, and contact with the skin), the pet also
inhales and ingests the toxic insecticide. The powder does not absorb
or dissipate with time, so anyone who touches or handles the pet later
may contact and potentially ingest the product (especially children).

Flea control on pets has been revolutionized with the use of topical
drops which are applied monthly, absorbed into the skin, and continue
to repel and kill fleas for 30 days. Sprays have also been revolutionized
in their safety and effectiveness. In many places flea powder is no
longer marketed.

Hopefully, public health officials will take note of this in their future
public recommendations - and consult a local veterinarian if they have
any questions. I'm concerned about pet owners rushing to purchase
"powder" when it is not the product of choice.

[Dr. Allen is correct. Powder is not the flea prevention of choice. There
are number of excellent products on the market. Please consult your
veterinarian for the best choice for your pet. - Mod.TG]

[A reader has sent the following comments on the original post on this
subject -- see first ref. below.

"Plague is enzootic, not endemic, since it involves other animals
besides man. Colorado is not in the southwestern USA. Ground
squirrels are the natural hosts, but not the golden-mantled species.
Concerning "a warm-blooded prairie dog", there are no cold-blooded
ones."

ProMED is grateful for these corrections. - Mod.JW]
