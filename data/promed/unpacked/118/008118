State officials: ducks found near Lynden died of fungal disease
---------------------------------------------------------------
More than 250 ducks found dead last week near Lynden [Washington state,
USA] appeared to have died from a fungal disease after eating moldy grain.
Kristin Mansfield, a veterinarian with the Washington State Department of
Fish and Wildlife, said necropsies conducted on some of the ducks showed
clear signs of aspergillosis, a fungal infection that can cause pneumonia
in birds.

The dead ducks, mostly mallards and pintails, were found on 26 Oct 2009 by
a Fish and Wildlife survey team near Wiser Lake and the Bylsma Levee on the
Nooksack River.

Aspergillosis is not contagious and is unlikely to pose a risk to people
who cook and eat healthy waterfowl from that area, Mansfield said. But
people should always avoid direct contact with dead or dying birds.

Anyone who finds a group of dead birds is asked to contact Fish and
Wildlife at (360) 466-4345, ext. 280.

[Aspergillosis is a general name given to a disease caused by aspergillus
fungi. Generally the spores are inhaled and then set up a disease process
within the lungs or the bronchus. In birds this process would probably be
in both the air sacs and the lungs. [Aspergillosis is a common infection in
birds; mallard ducks are very sensitive to this mold. - Mod.TG
