Bacterial Outbreak Grows in Gaston County
---------------------------------------------------
Gaston County health officials are urging parents and day-care centers to
continue following guidelines issued to deter a contagious intestinal
disease spread by contact with feces.
The number of shigellosis cases in Gaston County is now 54 at 9 centers,
according to Renee Clark, a county health department nursing supervisor.
The total is nearly double the confirmed cases reported last week. Only 4
cases were confirmed countywide in 2002, Clark said.
The infection, caused by the shigella bacteria, [causes] symptoms of
cramps, fever, and vomiting. Anyone can get the infection, but it is more
easily spread in children, the elderly, or people with weak immune systems.
The infection is often treated with antibiotics. County health officials
have urged day-care centers, where nearly all the cases likely have
originated, to follow hand-washing and sanitizing guidelines. Nurses
assigned to each center also are testing children's stool samples for the
bacteria.
The infection is spread when a hand or other body part contaminated with
the bacteria comes into contact with the mouth. It can also be spread
through contaminated food or water and by contaminated bathroom surfaces.
The infection also can be spread by children sharing contaminated toys.

[Outbreaks of shigellosis often occur in day-care settings, where
hand-washing and overall hygiene may be suboptimal. It takes ingestion of
very few Shigella organisms to cause infection. Thus, just a few organisms
passed from one child's hand to another or to a toy and then ingested will
produce infection. - Mod.DK]
