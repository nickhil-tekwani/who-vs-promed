Quoting reports of the Medical Department, an official of the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Services [V&AH], while speaking to The Sangai Express, confirmed that 6 persons have died of rabies in the State [of Manipur] in the last month. Among the 6 dead, 3 are said to be from Phumlou Siphai, 2 from Achanbigei, and one each from Kongba and Ahallup.

Against this backdrop, experts have mooted urgent formulation of specific measures to tackle prevalence of rabies in the State. Putting the figure of dogs in the State at 182 000, the V&AH official further said that there has been no specific policy for prevention of diseases relating to animals in the State. As a measure to prevent rabies in the State the department has today administered anti-rabies vaccination to 80 000 dogs, the official said while also adding that the department is planning more such vaccination programmes by procuring 30 000 doses of anti-rabies vaccine.

He further cautioned that if a person is bitten by a dog, the dog should be kept under observation for 10 to 14 days. In case the dog dies during the observation period, it should be taken to the V&AH department for necessary testing. Stating that a single vaccination of anti-rabies can be effective for 12 months, the official said there is no need to panic if dogs are vaccinated regularly.

[Manipur (or Maneepo) is a state in northeastern India, with the city of Imphal as its capital. Manipur can be located in the maps of India at http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/indiastateandunion.htm and http://healthmap.org/r/4816.

This report seems to indicate that control of canine rabies relies on vaccination of urban dogs, but this is not undertaken in a regular manner. The occurrence of 6 human deaths in a month, apparently following dog bites, is alarming and indicates that the attempt to control rabies in dogs by vaccination has been ineffective.

The high death rate in the human population suggests that the availability of vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis of human victims has been inadequate. The typical incubation period following a dog bite is usually 3 to 8 weeks, but it can be as little as 9 days or as long as several years in rare cases. The incubation period depends on several factors, including the location of the wound. Post-exposure prophylaxis should be implemented immediately. Curiously in this report there is little information on the extent of human exposure. Little seems to have changed in Manipur since a previous report in ProMED-mail in 2006 [see below]. - Mod.CP]
