Lack of Autopsies Hampering Fight Against Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
An influenza expert has given warning of a dangerous gap in ability to
understand and treat avian influenza because of a failure to conduct
post-mortem examinations on most of the victims so far.
"The big problem, of course, is that the number of people on whom real
extensive pathology has been carried out is limited," said Albert
Osterhaus, Head of the National Influenza Centre at Erasmus University in
Rotterdam. Of 74 people who have died in the Asian outbreak of H5N1 avian
influenza, only 4 or 5 full post-mortems have been carried out, all of them
in Thailand. "Autopsies are not regularly done," said Osterhaus. "That is
really an enormous problem."
The main barriers in the countries that have confirmed human cases --
Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia, China and Indonesia -- are cultural and
religious. Islam, for example, prohibits postmortem examinations under most
circumstances. Dr. Osterhaus fears that the lack of post-mortem information
will slow the search for a vaccine. Such data can help scientists choose
the best animal species on which to test potential vaccines, for instance.
No human cases of avian influenza have yet been found in Britain. But the
number of routine autopsies has been declining. Between 1992 and 2001, the
number of post-mortems held after deaths in British hospitals fell from
about one in 10 to one in 40. The decline accelerated after the scandal at
Alder Hey children's hospital, Merseyside, over the retention by doctors of
body parts from babies without parental permission. But Dr. Osterhaus says
post-mortem results are vital for doctors to understand diseases and to
spot mistakes so that they can be avoided in the future.
A study published today [3 Jan 2006] in the online journal Public Library
of Science (PLOS): Medicine illustrates the point, he says. A joint
Canadian-Chinese team pooled data from 32 victims of SARS (severe acute
respiratory syndrome) from the 2003 outbreak, which killed 774 people. Some
pathologists were said to be reluctant to carry out autopsies because of
infection risk. However, the team was able to show that the SARS virus was
present in the lungs for only about 2 weeks before being eliminated by the
immune system. The researchers also found that death was not due to damage
caused by the virus in other tissues. However, 25 of the 32 patients died
outside the 2-week window, suggesting that the body's inflammatory response
to damage in the lungs could ultimately prove fatal. Treatment of patients
with anti-viral drugs was, therefore, vital to limit such damage and save
lives.

[The decline in the inclusion of autopsy reports in routine diagnosis is a
general trend not specific to cultural environment or medical priorities.
The local health authorities in East Asian countries should be given
technical and financial support to facilitate autopsy examinations in human
cases of avian influenza. - Mod.CP]
