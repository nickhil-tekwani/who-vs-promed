Another case of bird flu infects northern region woman
------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu [avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection] has infected a
young woman in the northern province of Tuyen Quang, the 3rd case
this year in Viet Nam. On Mon 1 Mar 2010, the Ministry of Health
announced a 17-year-old girl had tested positive for the bird flu
[avian influenza (H5N1)] virus in Tuyen Quang province in Son Duong
district. The girl had experienced high fever, cough and sore throat
on 19 Feb 2010, and then was treated in the district General Hospital
on 24 Feb 2010. Doctors suspected she had bird flu and gave her
Tamiflu. Experts said chickens at the girl's house had died suddenly
10 days before and the girl had destroyed the whole flock.

The country has reported 3 cases of avian flu since 1 Jan 2010,
including one death -- a woman in the Mekong Delta province of Tien
Giang. Recent outbreaks in poultry flocks in the Mekong Delta
province of Ca Mau have caused alarm in the Delta, so the Deputy
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Diep Kinh Tan held
talks with the provincial leaders of Ca Mau and Bac Lieu on [Mon 1
Mar 2010]. The outbreaks occurred in Ca Mau town and districts of
Tran Van Thoi and U Minh in late February [2010]. Tests showed the
chickens were positive for the disease and around 5500 birds were destroyed.

On the same day, the deputy chairman of Khanh Hoa's People's
Committee, Nguyen Chien Thang, announced 2 outbreaks of bird flu in
district Ninh Hoa and Van Ninh. Waterfowls have died in scattered
farms in the 2 districts. Most of samples tested positive for the
disease. Veterinarians have disinfected the areas and killed around
9378 animals.
