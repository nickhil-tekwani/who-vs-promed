Influenza viruses continue to spread as indicated by the increasing number
of isolates and the number of countries reporting laboratory confirmed
cases in the northern hemisphere. Regional or widespread activity has been
reported in several states of the USA but activity has in general been
described as sporadic. Both influenza A and B have diagnosed. Where
influenza A has been further identified, the H3N2 subtype has predominated,
except in the UK where H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes have been identified in about
equal numbers. Since 1 October influenza A (H3N2) has been confirmed in
Argentina, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan,
Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, UK, and the USA; influenza A (H1N1)
in Argentina, Hong Kong, Israel, Portugal, Sweden, and UK; and non-typed
influenza A in Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary and Iceland.
Influenza B has been confirmed in Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France,
Russian Federation, Senegal, Spain, Switzerland, UK, USA, and Zambia.
Apart from outbreaks of influenza A (H3N2) in Chile and Fiji, the season in
the southern hemisphere was waning in September, although cases continued
to be reported: New Zealand mainly influenza A (H3N2); Tahiti, French
Polynesia both H1N1 and H3N2, and South Africa mainly H3N2.
