The Health Ministry has called on the public to report on their
neighbors who harbor mosquitoes, as 16 people have died due to dengue
this year [2007].
Health Ministry parliamentary secretary Datuk Lee Kah Choon said
public tip offs on potential mosquito breeding grounds were crucial
to help minimize risk of dengue outbreaks in neighborhoods, adding
that 13 dengue-related deaths were recorded in Selangor. Kuala
Lumpur, Negeri Sembilan and Johor had each recorded one
dengue-related death, he added.
"Our intention is not to punish errant neighbors. We need to create
awareness on the importance of cleanliness to help control the deadly
outbreak," he said. Lee said this after presenting aerosol cans and
Abate to members of the Penang Schoolbus Association at Batu Lanchang
Market here yesterday [4 Feb 2007].
Lee said a total of 6458 suspected dengue cases were recorded
nationwide during the 1st 5 weeks of the year 2007, adding that about
50 per cent of the cases were in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur.
"We have deployed 100 additional (health department) staff from
neighboring states to help contain the outbreak in Selangor and Kuala
Lumpur.
"We carry out fogging within 24 hours after dengue cases are traced
in an area. We also distribute abates in affected areas to kill the
mosquitoes larvae," he said.
He added the _Aedes_ mosquitoes breed in clear stagnant waters,
including waters in flower pots and exposed containers.
Vacant land, children's playgrounds, houses and shops topped the list
of mosquito breeding grounds, he said.
Lee said all sectors must work together to help contain the outbreak
to help clear the country's image, especially as this year is Visit
Malaysia 2007.
"We do not want the foreigners to have a lasting negative image about
our country, as this will affect the tourism industry," he said.
Lee also called on school bus drivers to spray the school buses with
mosquito repellents before fetching children during dawn and dusk.
"Peak feeding time for mosquitoes [is] during dawn and dusk. We need
to protect the schoolchildren from mosquito bites as they board
school buses either during dawn (for those going to morning school)
or dusk (for those returning from afternoon school)," he said.

[Willing citizen involvement in _Aedes aegypti_ control will be
critical in reducing dengue virus transmission. Thorough control will
require essentially house-to-house and shop-to-shop coverage. We wish
the Ministry of Health authorities success in achieving the level of
public collaboration that is needed.

About 3100 dengue cases were reported in Singapore last year [2006],
dropping significantly from the previous year's number of 14 200,
according to a Channel NewsAsia report on Wednesday [7 Feb 2007].
The number of homes found to be breeding mosquitoes dropped to just
18 in every 10 000 homes last year [2006], compared to 53 in 2005,
the report said. This drop was thanks to the dengue prevention
campaign launched by the government, it said.
The National Environment Agency (NEA) carried out 1.5 million
inspections on homes to find mosquito-breeding places last year
[2006], up 60 percent from 2005.
Furthermore, during the run-up to the Lunar New Year, which will fall
on 17 Feb 2007, environment officers have worked with plant nurseries
to check for mosquito breeding in their premises and the plants
specially brought in for the Lunar New Year, the report said.
The agency has distributed thousands of posters to residents and
companies urging them to do their part to minimize mosquito breeding.
Homes or commercial areas which are found to be breeding mosquitoes
will be fined 200 Singapore dollars [about USD 130] each.
60 dengue cases a week were reported for the 1st month of this year
[2007], the same weekly average as last year, according to the report.

The dengue fever epidemic in Central Java claimed the lives of 43
people in January this year [2007], head of the provincial health
office Endang Agustinar said.
The overall number of dengue fever cases in January 2007 reached
1358, roughly level with the January 2006 total of 1465.
"Several areas recorded a sharp rise in infection, such as Blora
regency, where 10 out of 141 patients died. In Pati regency, 7 out of
153 patients died," said Endang.
In Semarang, one person died out of the 155 cases recorded. The city
saw 364 cases in the same month last year [2006], of which 27 people,
mostly children, died.
Dozens of patients are still being treated in Semarang's Elisabeth,
Roemani and Kariadi hospitals.
"There is no medicine or vaccine to fight the disease so far. The
most effective way (to fight dengue) is to eradicate mosquito
breeding areas ... by cleaning and draining water containers, closing
them to prevent mosquitoes laying eggs and burying anything that
might hold water," said Endang.
The Semarang Health Office has fumigated a number of villages, while
it has also distributed notices to elementary school students to
monitor mosquito larvae, the results of which must be handed over to
their teachers.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
