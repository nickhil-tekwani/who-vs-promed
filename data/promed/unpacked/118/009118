Many sick or dead endangered brown pelicans were found this week at the
Salton Sea, the apparent victims of Avian Botulism --a disease responsible
for killing about 20,000 birds there in the summer of 1996 in just over
three months.
Temperatures climbed past 110 degrees when the pelicans were discovered
earlier this week.
Twenty-five dead brown pelicans were recovered from the inland sea, about
120 miles northeast of San Diego, and 15 sick brown pelicans were being
treated at a facility recently built near the refuge headquarters.
Carcasses were shipped to the USD Geological Survey's National Wildlife
Health Center in Madison Wisconsin, so scientists there can determine the
cause of death.
"It's beginning," said Clark Bloom, refuge manager for the US Fish and
Wildlife Service. "We strongly suspect Avian Botulism. Botulism doesn't
really thrive until it gets good and hot." Avian botulism slowly killed
several hundred pelicans last summer. "It appears like the best case
scenario this year is that we would have a chronic condition like we had a
year ago where we lost about 50 birds a week. The worst case would be a
repeat of 1996."
