Salmonella outbreak in Girona, Spain
------------------------------
On 24 June 2002 the Departament de Sanitat i Seguretat Social de
Generalitat de Catalunya (department of health and social security of the
regional government of Catalonia) was notified of several cases of
gastroenteritis with fever in people who had all eaten pastries known as
cocas. These pastries, which are made with eggs and have a custard
filling, are produced for the festival of San Juan, which takes place
annually in Catalonia on the evening of 23 June. The cocas were all made
and purchased at the same bakery in a tourist town in the province of
Girona. The eggs used to make the custard in this bakery were pasteurized
and cooked. The bakery is now under investigation. Three other bakeries
also made and sold cocas on 23 June, but none of the cases have been
linked to these establishments.
There have been 1243 cases, according to attending hospitals and outpatient
emergency wards of the area. Four hundred and nine cases were in patients
who live in the town in which the bakery is located. Most of the other
patients are from other towns in Catalonia. Sixteen patients are from other
regions of Spain, and 47 patients are foreign tourists (14 from the United
Kingdom, nine from France, seven from Italy, five from Germany, five from
the Netherlands, three from Ireland, two from Belgium, one from Denmark,
and one from Switzerland).
One hundred and nine patients required hospital admission. All of them are
recovering well and only two patients remain in hospital.
Clinical features of the cases have been diarrhea (97%), fever (78%),
abdominal pain (73%), nausea (42%), and vomiting (42%).
The onset of symptoms was analyzed for 162 cases. The mean incubation
period was 16 hours, with a range of 3-59 hours. Altogether 6.2% of the
patients experienced symptoms within six hours of having been exposed,
49.2% between six and 12 hours after exposure, and 44.5% after 12 hours
(figure). [there is a nice epidemic curve on the website. - Mod.MPP]
The sex distribution of all cases was 49.2% males and 50.8% females. Age
and sex distribution of 834 patients is shown in the table.

25-44 / 156 (39.1) / 161 (37.0) / 317 (38.0)
45-64 / 90 (22.5) / 122 (28.1) / 212 (25.4)
>64 / 3 (18.3) / 79 (18.2) / 152 (18.2)
Total / 399 (100) / 435 (100) / 834 (99.9)
Microbiological testing of feces has produced 47 isolates of Salmonella
enterica. Two of these patients also have positive blood culture for
isolates of Salmonella enterica. Salmonella enterica has also been isolated
in custard samples from the suspected pastry. Phage typing and molecular
epidemiology results of these isolates are pending.
