[The following information was obtained from the Government of Scotland's Fisheries Research Services website http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Uploads/Documents/AAAH01Gyro.pdf: "_Gyrodactylus salaris_ is a member of a genus of small parasitic worms that have been studied since the 1880s. Over 400 _Gyrodactylus_ species, infesting fish and frogs in both fresh and salt water have been identified. In 1956 _G. salaris_ was described in Sweden by Goran Malmberg. _G. salaris_ measure approximately 0.5 mm, and are visible only with the aid of magnification. In the field, it is possible to see them with a hand lens. Without magnification, young salmon [parr] heavily infected by _G. salaris_ appear greyish, with excess mucus, and possibly concurrent fungal infections.

_G. salaris_ attach to the host by means of an organ called the opisthaptor at one end of the body. At the other end of the worm is the mouth. Many _Gyrodactylus_ species feed on mucus only, and cause little damage to the host either by feeding or by attachment. However, _G. salaris_ can inflict large wounds on the salmon host when feeding.

The main body of the parasite contains a developing embryo, and gyrodactylus gives birth to young that are virtually the same size as the mother. In an amazing feat of nature, inside that embryo there is usually another developing worm, forming a 'Russian doll' arrangement.

Reproduction occurs rapidly, particularly at high temperature, when populations of parasites can double in 4 days. Once infected by _G. salaris_, individual parr can soon become almost completely covered by thousands of parasites, giving impression of a thick layer of mucus. These heavy infections damage the skin and enable secondary infection by bacteria, viruses, or fungi, which contribute to massive mortalities.

In Norway, catastrophic losses of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) were noticed following the introduction of _G. salaris_ to the country in the 1970s on imported live fish from an infected area. By 2002, 44 Norwegian rivers had been infected, and their salmon populations decimated. Fishery losses due to the parasite have been estimated at over 40 per cent of total reported catch of wild salmon."

"_Gyrodactylus salaris_ is an ectoparasite affecting mainly on Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), but can survive and reproduce on several salmonids, such as rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), Arctic charr (_Salvelinus alpinus_), North American brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_), grayling (_Thymallus thymallus_), North American lake trout (_Salvelinus namaycush_), and brown trout (_Salmo trutta_) (in declining order of susceptibility).

_G. salaris_ is restricted in its distribution to Europe. It has been recovered from farmed Atlantic salmon or farmed rainbow trout in several (mainly northern) European countries. In the wild, the parasite has been found on wild salmonids, mainly Atlantic salmon parr, in rivers in Russia, Sweden, and Norway. _G. salaris_ is more common in farmed rainbow trout than previously thought, and is likely to be present in more countries than those currently known. In 2006, _G. salaris_ was reported from fish farms in Italy and, in 2007, from fish farms in Poland and Macedonia. In 2009, _G. salaris_ was identified by the OIE reference laboratory, from fish farms in Romania. Great Britain and Ireland have been demonstrated to be free of the parasite".
