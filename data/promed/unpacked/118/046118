The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating
with public health officials in many states, the Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA), and the State of Rhode Island to
investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype
Montevideo infections. Investigators are using DNA analysis of
salmonella bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing to identify
cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

As of 9:00 pm EST on 9 Mar 2010, a total of 249 individuals infected
with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo, which displays
either of 2 closely related pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
patterns, have been reported from 44 states and District of Columbia
since 1 Jul 2009. The number of ill persons identified in each state
with this strain is as follows: AK (1), AL (2), AZ (7), CA (31), CO
(5), CT (5), DC (1), DE (3), FL (3), GA (3), IA (1), ID (4), IL (22),
IN (4), KS (5), LA (1), MA (14), MD (1), ME (1), MI (4), MN (6), MO
(2), MS (1), NC (11), ND (1), NE (3), NH (2), NJ (9), NM (2), NY
(18), OH (9), OK (1), OR (9), PA (7), RI (2), SC (1), SD (3), TN (5),
TX (7), UT (9), VA (1), WA (18), WI (1), WV (1), and WY (2). Because
the main _S._ Montevideo outbreak PFGE pattern is commonly occurring
in the USA, public health investigators may determine that some of
the illnesses are not part of this outbreak.

_S._ Senftenberg, a different serotype, has been found in food
samples from retail and a patient household during this outbreak
investigation. PulseNet identified 8 persons who had illness caused
by serotype Senftenberg with matching PFGE patterns between 1 Jul
2009 and today [11 Mar 2010]. Public health officials have
interviewed 6 of the 8 ill persons with this strain of serotype
Senftenberg and determined that 2 purchased a recalled salami product
during the week before their illness began. These 8 cases are not
included in the overall case count reported above.

Among the persons with reported dates available, illnesses began
between 4 Jul 2009 and 18 Feb 2010. Infected individuals range in age
from less than 1 year old to 93 years old and the median age is 37
years. 53 percent of patients are male. Among the 190 patients with
available information, 49 (26 percent) were hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
During 16-21 Jan 2010, the CDC and public health officials in
multiple states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods
eaten by 41 ill and 41 well persons. Preliminary analysis of this
study has suggested salami as a possible source of illness. Ill
persons (58 percent) were significantly more likely than well persons
(16 percent) to report eating salami. Additionally, 16 ill persons
have been identified who purchased the same type of sliced salami
variety pack at different grocery store locations before becoming
ill; 3 additional ill persons have been identified who purchased a
similar type of sliced salami deli tray before becoming ill. These
data suggest this product is the source of some of these illnesses.
This sliced salami variety pack and sliced salami deli tray were
recently recalled by Daniele International Inc. The CDC and public
health officials in multiple states continue to interview ill persons
to ask them about the foods they ate during the week befor!
e they became ill as well as to collect shopper card information.

Recall Information
------------------
The FSIS has issued several news releases announcing Daniele
International Inc. recalled products and has compiled a master list
of these products for easy reference by consumers. News releases were
issued on 23 Jan 2010 (initial recall), 31 Jan (expanded recall), 4
Feb (updated information of 23 Jan recall), and 16 Feb (expanded
recall). Many of these products can have an extended shelf life of up
to a year. These products were distributed to retail establishments
nationwide.

Testing by the Rhode Island Department of Public Health found the
outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo in samples of black and red pepper
intended for use in the production of Italian-style meats at Daniele
International Inc. Since then, several recalls have been issued.

On 25 Feb 2010, Wholesome Spice, Brooklyn, NY, announced a recall of
25 pound boxes of crushed red pepper sold between 6 Apr 2009 and 20
Jan 2010. Wholesome Spice sells spices directly to commercial
customers, who may have incorporated them into their own products.
The FDA is currently working with Wholesome Spice to identify the
customers who received the recalled product and determine if further
recalls are necessary.

On 5 Mar 2010, Mincing Overseas Spice Company of Dayton, NJ,
voluntarily recalled 2 lots of black pepper due to possible
salmonella contamination. Black pepper was not distributed at retail
level and was shipped to FL, IA, IL, IN, MA, OK, NJ, NY, PA, RI, TX,
and WI. Customers who purchased black pepper from any parts of Lots
3258 and 3309 should place these lots or any spice blends made from
these lots under their control on hold and contact Mincing Overseas
Spice Company.

On 9 Mar 2010, Dutch Valley Food Distributors of Myerstown, PA,
announced a voluntary nationwide recall of black pepper and products
made with black pepper as a result of the Mincing Overseas Spice
Company black pepper recall. Retailers are advised to remove all
these products from store shelves based on lot number or manufacture
dates. Consumers who have purchased these products are asked to
destroy them. Consumers with questions regarding the products listed
may contact Dutch Valley Foods or visit the FDA's website
<http://www.fda.gov/>.

Laboratory Testing of Products and Ingredients
----------------------------------------------
The initial recall followed isolation of _S._ Senftenberg in a
private laboratory from a retail sample of a salami product produced
by Daniele International; this product was different than the sliced
salami variety pack purchased at different grocery store locations by
the 16 ill persons, but the same product purchased by 3 ill persons.
The FSIS reviewed and affirmed these private laboratory results. The
_S._ Senftenberg strain initially found by the private laboratory was
different from the _S._ Montevideo strain causing the outbreak.

However, the Washington State Department of Health subsequently
tested the bacterial culture provided by the private laboratory (the
salami was not provided) and identified 2 different serotypes: _S._
Senftenberg (the strain found by the private lab) and _S._ Montevideo
indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. In addition, the Iowa
Department of Public Health and public health officials in Plymouth
County, IA, investigated a patient with _S._ Montevideo infection
indistinguishable from the outbreak strain and discovered an open
sliced salami variety pack frozen at the patient's home. The patient
had eaten this product before becoming ill. This sliced salami
variety pack was the same as that purchased by 16 other ill persons.
Using DNA analysis, the University of Iowa Hygienic Laboratory
(Iowa's public health laboratory) confirmed that the serotype
isolated from this leftover salami was indistinguishable from the
outbreak strain of _S._ Montevideo.

The recall was expanded as a result of a confirmed finding of
salmonella in an unopened salami product reported by the Illinois
Department of Public Health. The product was sampled during the
course of an ongoing investigation of a multistate outbreak of _S._
Montevideo illnesses. The product tested was not included in the
previous recall issued 23 Jan 2010, but is a similar type of product
bought by customers who later became sick and were identified as part
of the _S._ Montevideo investigation. Subsequent testing revealed
that the product contained the _S._ Senftenberg strain. The company
believes that black pepper is a possible source of contamination.

On 28 Jan 2010, the Rhode Island Department of Health announced that
test results revealed that an opened container of black pepper used
in the manufacturing of at least some of the recalled products was
positive for _S._ Montevideo and that the DNA fingerprint matched the
outbreak strain: <http://www.ri.gov/press/view/10647>.

On 17 Feb 2010, results from laboratory testing of product from
Illinois revealed that the product contained the _S._ Senftenberg
strain.

On 25 Feb 2010, the FDA released additional information about its
investigation of supply chains of both black and red pepper used in
the manufacturing of the recalled Italian style meat products. The
agency has collected and is analyzing 153 composite pepper samples,
which represent more than 4000 individual samples of black and red
pepper. Samples from 2 lots of crushed red pepper collected from
Daniele International Inc. have tested positive for positive for the
same strain of _S._ Montevideo associated with the outbreak.
