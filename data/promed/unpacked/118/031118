Canker found in DeSoto citrus nursery
-------------------------------
More citrus canker (CC) has been confirmed from DeSoto County trees
tested for the bacterial disease in June 2005. Denise Fieber,
spokeswoman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services, said 5 young citrus trees were confirmed to be CC-infected
in an Orange County nursery. Orange County is located east of Arcadia
on State Road 70, and the nursery where the infected young trees were
found serves to grow new trees for groves owned by the parent
company, Fieber said.

All of the plants were in an enclosed nursery area, Fieber said.
Because of that, 95 000 other new trees in the nursery will be
destroyed. All are young trees growing in containers. Fieber said
state officials are not certain whether any plants from the Orange
County nursery had been shipped for use in groves in other parts of
the state. She said her department is investigating that prospect and
where shipments might have been destined.

"We'll be tracing forward all the resets that went out of there,"
Fieber said. "And we're surveying for CC around that area." 2 months
ago, shipments from a Ben Hill Griffin nursery in Frostproof caused
trees to be destroyed in Highlands, Hardee and Polk counties. CC also
apparently spread from the nursery to nearby groves, where it was
discovered a month later.

Fieber said another CC-infected orange tree was confirmed in Hardee
County on Friday. Hardee had been CC-free until [June 2005], when
some Hardee trees near the north DeSoto County line were found to be
infected as a result of "resets" from the infected Polk County
nursery. CC was found in 85 mature Hamlin trees, state officials said.

Fieber said it's not yet known how many trees will have to be
destroyed as a result of the new Hardee find. The newest Hardee
discovery was on a mature Hamlin orange tree adjacent to a 1900-foot
arc from earlier discoveries, Fieber said.

Last month, in Highlands County, CC was found in an abandoned nursery
block near Venus, an area under nearly a 20-square-mile quarantine.
Work is under way to determine how much destruction must take place
there. In all, 22 Florida counties -- virtually the entire
citrus-growing region -- are infected with CC.

CC, a disease that causes lesions on fruit and branches but does not
harm humans, was first discovered in Florida in 1910. Outbreaks have
been quashed twice, but the newest outbreak began near Miami-Dade
Airport in 1995 and has spread in all directions since then.

3 hurricanes that struck the citrus-growing region last summer are
believed by state officials to have spread CC bacteria widely.
Counties that had been CC-free, such as St. Lucie, Charlotte, Hardee
and Polk, had infections following passage of the hurricanes. The
bacteria are known to be spread by windborne rains. CC-infected trees
are destroyed and a 1900-foot radius is drawn, within which all trees
must be uprooted and burned. The same control method was used with
Florida's 1st canker outbreak in 1910.

Additionally, adjacent areas may be placed under quarantine,
restricting access and use of the groves. 26 square miles near
mid-DeSoto County are under quarantine, as are another 19 square
miles near the Highlands County line.

So far in 2005, state officials have destroyed 431 449 orange trees
in DeSoto groves and 1458 trees in private yards. Discoveries last
month could add another 100 000 or more trees to this total as
control work continues.

[Reports of CC, caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv.
_citri_, show no sign of slowing down in southern Florida.
