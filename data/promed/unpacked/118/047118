[The manifestations of tularemia are not stated and it would not be surprising if oropharyngeal tularemia is occurring as this outbreak, given its size, may be waterborne.

Outbreaks of water-transmitted tularemia include 64 cases in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49 cases in Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2), an outbreak in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to contamination of a water supply (3), improperly prepared water for washing in the Czech Republic (4), and a Swedish outbreak associated with a contaminated well used for drinking water (5). Additionally, during the period 1936 to 1963, there were approximately 30 outbreaks of water-borne tularemia reported from the then Soviet Union (6).
