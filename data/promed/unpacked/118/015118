New cases of the Ebola virus are now suspected in the West African nation of Guinea, according to the country's health minister.

The latest report from Agence France Presse put the death toll there at 4 people, noting these are the 1st cases of Ebola in Guinea since 2016. Local reports put the death toll at 3, with a small cluster of cases emerging in the community of Gouecke in the country's south. Gouecke and nearby hub Nzerekore are not far from the borders with Liberia and Cote d'Ivoire.

Health Minister Remy Lamah said at least one patient was taken to Conakry for treatment rather than kept in isolation in Nongo, a cause for concern as officials wait for a 2nd set of results to confirm the Ebola infections.

Lamah promised a more comprehensive statement when those tests, which are in progress, are available.

At least 2 of the cases were confirmed by initial lab results, according to hospital employees speaking with local reporters.

The early reports from Guinea come as officials in the Democratic Republic of Congo announced a 3rd case of a reemerging Ebola virus outbreak in the country's volatile east.

The World Health Organization said this case was confirmed in Katwa, just a few kilometers east of Butembo and the 1st new case reported earlier this week. The new cases have emerged since Congolese officials declared an end to Ebola in June 2020, after an outbreak that claimed 2300 lives, many of them in Katwa and Butembo.

[This latest report on possibly 4 cases in Guinea is disturbing since it implies that the virus has now spread more than 2000 miles beyond the location of the initial cases in the DRC.

The epidemic of Ebola virus disease in Guinea from 2013-2016 represented the 1st ever outbreak of Ebola in a West African country. Previous outbreaks had been confined to Sub-Saharan Africa.

The epidemic, which began with the death of a 2-year-old boy, was part of a larger Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa which spread through Guinea and the neighboring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone, with minor outbreaks occurring in Senegal, Nigeria, and Mali. In December 2015, Guinea was declared free of Ebola transmission by the U.N. World Health Organization; however, further cases continued to be reported from March 2016. The country was again declared as Ebola-free in June 2016 (Wikipedia). - Mod.LK]

- Nzerekore: 4 fatal cases

Ebola has killed 4 in Guinea in its 1st resurgence of disease in years. The Health Minister says officials are "really concerned" about deaths in the south-east region Nzerekore.

One of the latest victims in Guinea was a nurse who fell ill in late January 2021 and was buried on 1 Feb 2021, National Health Security Agency head Sakoba Keita told local media. "Among those who took part in the burial, 8 people showed symptoms: diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding," he said. "Three of them died, and 4 others are in hospital."

The 4 deaths from Ebola hemorrhagic fever occurred in the south-east region of Nzerekore, he said.

Ebola also killed a woman in Democratic Republic of Congo, the health ministry says.

Keita also told local media that one patient had "escaped" but had been found and hospitalised in the capital Conakry. He confirmed the comments to AFP without giving further details.

The World Health Organization has eyed each new outbreak since 2016 with great concern, treating the most recent one in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as an international health emergency.

DRC has faced several outbreaks of the illness, with the WHO confirming a resurgence 3 months after authorities declared the end of the country's latest outbreak.

The country had declared the 6-month epidemic over in November 2021. It was the country's 11th Ebola outbreak, claiming 55 lives out of 130 cases.

The widespread use of vaccinations, which were administered to more than 40 000 people, helped curb the disease.

The 2013-16 outbreak sped up the development of a vaccine against Ebola, with a global emergency stockpile of 500 000 doses planned to respond quickly to future outbreaks, the vaccine alliance Gavi said in January 2021.

- Nzerekore prefecture: 8 cases suspected

Following a burial, 8 cases of diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding were reported, including 3 deaths in the sub-prefecture of Goueke, 45 km from N'Zerekore.

Samples [from patients with haemorrhagic fever] were taken and sent to the Labs of Gueckedou and Conakry. Four patients have been isolated at the CTEPI in N'Zerekore since 11 Feb 2021, and one in Conakry on 12 Feb 2021.

The Gueckedou lab provided a 1st result revealing the presence of the Ebolavirus. A 2nd confirmation is underway at the hemorrhagic fever laboratory in Conakry.

Case history information:
A nurse from the Goueke health center fell ill; she was examined by the head of the center and referred to N'Zerekore center; she died between 27 and 28 Jan 2021. His burial took place on 1 Feb 2021 in Goueke. She was among the people who took part in the funeral that these 8 cases were counted from.

Measures taken:
Isolation of all suspected cases at CTEPI N'Zerekore and Conakry; Case investigation to clarify data, identify other suspected cases, and identify and isolate all contacts (an investigative mission left for Goueke on 13 Feb 2021); Initiate steps to acquire vaccines against Ebola from WHO and CDC with a view to possibly carrying out a ring vaccination in the affected areas.

A declaration will be made upon re-confirmation.

[Unsafe practices at the burial likely led to the 8 cases, who were all in attendance. Education programs will need to be reinitiated along with vaccination of contacts. One has to worry about the spread from other casual contacts who have not been identified. - Mod.LK]

[2] DRC (North Kivu): virus transmission via semen

Lancet Glob Health 2016; 4: e736-43. Published Online 30 Aug 2016 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/ S2214-109X(16)30175-9.
------------------------------
There are fears of a new Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) after the country has been hit with new cases of the disease.

It's known that Ebola can linger in bodily fluids, namely semen, for over a year after the initial infection. A 2016 study published in the Lancet Global Health found that 24 out of 429 men in Liberia tested positive for Ebola in their semen at least 12 months after they'd recovered from the disease. In one of the men, Ebola virus RNA was detected in the semen 565 days after recovery from the infection.

The disease can also be spread by having contact with urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and amniotic fluid of a person who is sick with or who has died from Ebola virus disease. Additionally, the virus is still present in animal reservoirs in the region.

The WHO is also investigating whether the new case is linked to "a new spillover event" or whether it is a resurgence of the outbreak that ran from 2018 to 2020.

"Samples have been sent to the National Institute of Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, #DRC for genome sequencing to determine a link to the previous outbreak. It is not unusual for sporadic cases to occur following a major outbreak," tweeted WHO African Region.

Ebola is a viral disease that causes problems with how your blood clots and is often fatal if left untreated. Around half the people who contract the disease die, although case fatality rates have varied from 25 percent to 90 percent in different outbreaks. The infection often starts with symptoms such as fever, fatigue, muscle pains, and is followed by vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and unexplained bleeding. Fortunately, effective Ebola vaccines have been developed in recent years and were extensively used in the 2018-2020 DRC outbreak.

The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the deadliest outbreak of the disease in history, with more than 28 600 cases and 11 325 deaths, primarily in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in the DRC was responsible for around 3470 cases and 2280 deaths. Like many countries that have dealt with severe disease outbreaks, the DRC has noted that their experience with Ebola taught them some important lessons about how to prepare for COVID-19.

"DRC is now better, smarter, and faster at responding to Ebola, and this is an enduring legacy that is supporting the response to COVID-19 and other outbreaks," Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement last year [2020].

[Anxiously awaiting sequencing results, which will clarify whether the virus circulating is from a new spillover event or transmission from husband to wife. Either way, the response is now in action to control spread. But the latest case in Guinea is concerning since it demonstrates cases of the virus beyond the borders of DRC. - Mod.LK
