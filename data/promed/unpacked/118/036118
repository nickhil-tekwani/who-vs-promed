More than 400 people in southwestern France have been stricken with
trichinosis, with more than 30 people needing hospital treatment when the
epidemic broke out in the Toulouse region. One man went into a prolonged
coma and is still unable to speak. The victims have formed an association
to sue those responsible.
The first cases of _Trichinella_ poisoning, which can affect the heart and
proves fatal in five out of every 1,000 cases, were identified in early
October and the parasite has since been traced to a single horse that was
imported from Serbia.
France consumed 37,000 tonnes of horse meat last year : 34,300 tonnes of
the total were imported, principally from Poland, Canada and the United
States.
