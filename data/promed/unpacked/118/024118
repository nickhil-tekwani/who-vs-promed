ETHIOPIA: Suspected anthrax epidemic in Afar Region
-----------------------------------------------------
Following a local alert that "hundreds" of people are reportedly dying from
a "peculiar killer syndrome" in the Afar Region, northeastern Ethiopia, a
report from the UN Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia (UN-EUE) warns there is an
immediate need to "investigate, detect and confirm fears of an anthrax
epidemic in Zones 4 and 5 of Afar Region ... which appears likely to spread
into Amhara Region and other areas of the country". In an investigative
mission in April, UN-EUE found 51 people in one village, Whama, had died in
February and March alone. Health workers and doctors -- including an MSF
doctor operating in Dubti hospital -- report an "unknown" fatal disease
which includes swelling of the neck and cheeks and bloody diarrhoea.
Pastoralist Afars in Ethiopia, who share international borders with Eritrea
and Djibouti, are suffering "persisting drought", warns the report, made
worse by the Ethiopia-Eritrean conflict which has displaced some 30,000
Afar people. Cross-border animal trading has ceased since the beginning of
the conflict in 1998, which "represents a major cut back for the Afar
economy". Despite some rainfall in the region, the northernmost territory
near the Eritrean border remains dry. The conflict has also restricted
traditional drought-related migration.
Approximately 17,000 internally war-displaced Afars are in need of non-food
relief items, reports the UN-EUE.

[If it is anthrax, the reported symptoms would be characteristic of enteric
anthrax ("bloody diarrhoea") and oral anthrax ("swollen cheeks & neck");
when the lesion is in the mouth or the throat there is the added serious
risk of being unable to breathe. With malnutrition their immune systems are
already seriously compromised permitting a lower infective (& lethal) dose.
The source would be dead animals and under the circumstances might even be
animals dead for some time and sundried. While not minimizing the
seriousness of the situation the numbers affected will be less than
"hundreds" (whatever large number that is) and a range of different
diseases will be involved, not just anthrax even if it is one of the
diseases involved. - Mod. MHJ]
