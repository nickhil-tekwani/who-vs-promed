Re: ProMED-mailÂ´s comment on the reports concerning _Aedes_ mosquitoes: "I
hope somebody is rechecking Italy and Israel".
With regard to Israel: Annual surveys of the mosquito species have been in
progress for many years (and are still continuing today). Mosquitoes,
especially larvae, are collected by field teams from the Ministry of
Environment and identified at the Entomology Laboratory of the Ministry of
Health. Until today no _Aedes albopictus_ has been recorded. The last
record of _Aedes aegypti_ was in 1975, as mentioned by Dr. Gratz. Based on
these facts, we hope dengue should not be a problem in Israel in the future.
