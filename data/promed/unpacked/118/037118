In regard to the possibility of individuals being closely exposed to
rabies (especially via transocular contact) I would have felt that
every possible precaution should be instigated just as soon as possible.
This route of exposure can result in very rapid infection and this would
strongly suggest that hyperimmune serum should be used along with a full
5+ course of active vaccination.
[Personally I would be slow to trust rabies vaccine given in 1988 at this
stage. I would presume this individual to be fully non immune]

One question that has come up for postexposure prophylaxis of
Pediatric patients, is the issue of HRIG dosing for different
age groups. I've not seen any data on age and dose. This maybe
more of a concern for dosing infants, which we've had to
recommend in Washington State recently. We've stuck with the 1.0 ml
dose as recommended but would like to see some data to support it.
Anybody have that info?
