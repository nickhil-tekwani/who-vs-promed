White nose syndrome shows up in Yancey County
---------------------------------------------
Biologists have confirmed white nose syndrome at a 3rd site in North
Carolina, meaning 2 counties are now positive for the disease that has
killed hundreds of thousands of bats in the eastern United States.

The disease was confirmed last week [week of 21 Feb 2011] in Yancey
County. It was previously discovered in a retired Avery County Mine
and in a cave at Grandfather Mountain State Park. While the news last
week that a deadly bat disease had arrived in North Carolina was
tragic, it did not come as a surprise to biologists.

In March 2010, the Commission took steps to get ahead of the disease
by adopting the "White nose Syndrome Surveillance and Response Plan
for North Carolina" with the US Fish & Wildlife Service and many other
partners. The plan outlines a number of steps to protect bats while
allowing biologists to pinpoint and investigate a possible outbreak as
quickly as possible.

"We knew that white nose syndrome (WNS) was coming and began
preparing for its arrival, but we have a lot of work to do to address
the impact of this disease on bats and our natural systems," said
Chris McGrath, wildlife diversity program coordinator in the
Commission's Wildlife Management Division.

"We and our conservation partners must focus resources upon
collaborative efforts, including monitoring the spread of the disease,
understanding how the potential loss of a significant proportion of
bats will affect the balance of nature and our lives, and finding ways
to combat those effects." The WNC Alliance (Western North Carolina
Alliance) will host a panel of experts from state and federal
organizations, universities, and non-profits to create conversation
around white nose syndrome in bats, how it is being treated,
implications, and what it means for people, from 6:30-8 p.m. Thu 10
Mar 2011, at UNC Asheville, NC.

For more on this panel, call WNCA AmeriCorps Outings & Education
Coordinator Lori Wilkins at 828-258-8737 or e-mail lori@wnca.org.


Precautionary measures
----------------------
While much remains to be learned about white nose syndrome, there is
evidence that people may inadvertently spread the fungus believed to
cause the disease from cave-to-cave. Therefore, the most important
step people can take to help bats is staying out of caves and mines.

[Many caves have been closed because of the risk of transporting the
causative agent for WNS on the clothes, boots, and equipment of
spelunkers and tourists.

Indeed, this disease is on the move and it is prudent to plan in
advance. - Mod.TG
