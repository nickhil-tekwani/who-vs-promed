[1] Preparedness
Date: Sun 20 Mar 2022
Source: New York Times [edited; a version of this article appears in print on 20 Mar 2022 of the New York edition with the headline: US isn't ready if Covid surges, scientists warn]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/19/health/covid-ba2-surge-variant.html


Scarcely 2 months after the omicron variant drove coronavirus case numbers to frightening heights in the United States, scientists and health officials are bracing for another swell in the pandemic and, with it, the first major test of the country's strategy of living with the virus while limiting its impact. At local, state and federal levels, the nation has been relaxing restrictions and trying to restore a semblance of normalcy. Encouraging Americans to return to prepandemic routines, officials are lifting mask and vaccine mandates and showing no inclination of closing down offices, restaurants or theaters.

But scientists are warning that the United States isn't doing enough to prevent a new surge from endangering vulnerable Americans and potentially upending life again.

New pills can treat infections, but federal efforts to buy more of them are in limbo. An aid package in Congress is stalled, even as agencies run out of money for tests and therapeutics. Though less than one-third of the population has the booster shots needed for high levels of protection, the daily vaccination rate has fallen to a low.

While some Americans may never be persuaded to roll up their sleeves, experts said that health officials could be doing a lot more, for example, to get booster shots to the doorsteps of older people who have proved willing to take the initial doses. "You use the quiet periods to do the hard work," said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "You don't use the quiet to forget."

The clearest warnings that the brief period of quiet may soon be over have come, as they often have in the past 2 years, from Western Europe. In a number of countries, including Britain, France and Germany, case numbers are climbing as an even more contagious subvariant of omicron, known as BA.2, takes hold. In interviews, 10 epidemiologists and infectious disease experts said that many of the ingredients were in place for the same to happen in the United States, though it was unclear if or when a wave might hit or how severe it might be.

Case numbers are still dropping nationally, but BA.2 accounts for a growing proportion of those infections, rising to almost one-quarter of new cases last week. The subvariant is estimated to be 30% to 50% more contagious than the previous version of omicron, BA.1.

In New York City, average daily case numbers rose by roughly 40% over the past 2 weeks, though they remain extremely low compared with recent months. In Connecticut, scientists estimate that the frequency of BA.2 infections is doubling every 7 or 8 days -- half the rate of omicron's growth this winter, but also considerably faster than the delta variant's 11-day doubling time before that.

"I expect we'll see a wave in the US sooner than what most people expect," said Kristian Andersen, a virologist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. He said that it could come as soon as April [2022], or perhaps later in the spring or the early summer. And given that some cases inevitably turn more serious, Dr. Andersen said, "yes, such a wave would be accompanied by rising hospitalizations and deaths."

Some experts cautioned, however, that BA.2 had not driven up case numbers in every country where it emerged. In a best-case scenario, they said, even if American case numbers started climbing, leftover immunity from the first omicron wave this winter could help protect against a heavy surge of hospital admissions. And a shift toward outdoor socializing could temper an increase in case numbers.

For now, there are fewer COVID-19 patients in intensive care units than during almost any other point in the pandemic. The vaccines appear to protect as well against BA.2 as they did against the previous version of omicron, according to British data, and BA.2 does not seem to cause any more or less severe disease.

In trying to forecast what lies ahead, American health officials and scientists have debated what mixture of factors has driven up case numbers in Europe and just how serious the wave there could get.

The BA.2 subvariant began its march across Europe around the time that certain countries were lifting restrictions and mask mandates, potentially giving it extra kindling for its spread. Some scientists in Britain have also attributed that country's surge in part to the fact that immunity tends to weaken over time following vaccinations or earlier infections.

In some parts of Europe, like Denmark and the Netherlands, the peak of the BA.2 wave has already passed. In other countries, where case numbers have climbed since early March [2022], hospital admissions have remained flat or risen only slightly. But Britain has emerged as a more startling example of the potential for a surge in BA.2 cases to begin filling up hospital beds, too. People 70 and older in England have been infected at record levels, health officials said, with estimates that roughly one in every 30 people in that age group had COVID-19 in the week before [12 Mar 2022]. As a result, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients there has climbed by around 35% in recent weeks, though about half of those had tested positive incidentally after admission. To bolster protection, Britain plans to start administering 4th doses to older people later this month [April 2022].

In the United States, too, scientists are concerned that so many people have gone more than 6 months since their last doses of vaccine, reducing levels of immunity. Pfizer and BioNTech have asked American regulators to authorize 4th doses in older people, and Moderna is seeking clearance for the additional shots for all adults.

It is less clear whether relaxing COVID-19 rules in the United States will help fuel transmission to the same degree that it may have in some European nations. Parts of the United States have effectively been without restrictions for months. "There are lots of moving parts," said David Dowdy, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. "It's really difficult to disentangle which of these is driving any given wave."

Fewer than half of Americans who have received primary vaccine doses have taken booster shots, putting the United States in a more precarious position. Even though case numbers are so low, nearly 1200 Americans on average are dying each day from COVID-19 -- a rate far higher than in Western Europe, where older people tend to have received vaccines and boosters in higher numbers. As time passes, 2 doses become less effective at preventing omicron-related hospitalizations, British estimates suggest, whereas a booster dose restores protection to considerably higher levels.

Adding to the alarm in the United States, this week a number of wastewater testing sites had showed drastic increases in viral levels on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention map. But scientists said that it was difficult to measure changes while viral levels were so low and that the true picture was more muddled: Some wastewater sites in states like Massachusetts, Connecticut and Ohio had observed growing viral levels, while many others had not.

Whatever lies ahead, scientists said that now was the time to get more people vaccinated, while the country still had a say in the shape of any coming wave. "We should be reading about how the federal government is using its resources to go nursing home to nursing home, and church to church, to get booster numbers up," said Sam Scarpino, the managing director of pathogen surveillance at the Rockefeller Foundation. But the federal government is warning that pandemic funds are drying up.

A key question remains how much protection people who got sick with the previous version of omicron can count on -- and for how long. A lab study published this week found that vaccinated people who were infected with omicron had high levels of antibodies that would probably protect against BA.2. If that protection lasts, it could reduce the impact of any wave, given the country's high levels of infection this winter. "I think it's reassuring," said Dr Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and a co-author of the study. [Yu J, Collier AY, Rowe M, et al. Neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants. N Engl J Med. Correspondence. 16 Mar 2022. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2201849]

But some scientists said they worried that the immune defenses people built up during the first omicron surge would wane, leaving them more susceptible to BA.2. "The timing of BA.2's emergence, and the potential waning in immunity from the BA.1 wave with masks coming off, isn't great," said Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.

Even health experts who said they had become accustomed to the boom-bust cycle of pandemic funding said they were shocked that the money was drying up so soon after the country had outlined plans for adjusting to a new normal. That money, they said, was essential for avoiding full-scale shutdowns, and instead detecting surges early enough that health officials could recommend masks or increased testing in particular areas and help hospitals prepare. "People naturally, sensibly want to get back to their lives," said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University. "The question, then, is how quickly would we be able to stand up a response?"

[It is typical of governments to lose interest and drop funding when there is an apparent lull in activity even when a wider look indicates risk is still present. The US needs to pay attention to what is happening with COVID-19 cases in Europe and take heed. Read article in France24 English from 21 Mar 2022 (https://apple.news/AobvH5FjyTWyHcu2AYotJgg).

"France reported an average of close to 90 000 new coronavirus infections over the last 7 days, marking a 36% rise from one week ago when most COVID-19 health protocol measures were lifted by the government just ahead of the country's elections. New cases over the previous 24 hours published on [Sun 20 Mar 2022] stood at 81 283, pushing a 7-day moving average to 89 002, compared with just over 60 000 average new cases one week earlier. The number of cases per 100 000 inhabitants also reached their highest value level since 18 Feb 2022.

"The government of French president Emmanuel Macron, who will stand for re-election in less than 3 weeks, followed by legislative elections later this year, decided to lift most COVID-19 restrictions on 14 Mar 2022, citing a positive trend. This means people in France no longer have to wear face masks indoors, except for public transport, hospitals and other medical facilities. The government also lifted its COVID-19 vaccine pass requirement in places such as bars and cinemas.

"New hospital admissions - seen as a key indicator by France's health minister Olivier Veran - decreased by only 1.7% week-on-week, the slowest decline since early February 2022, potentially indicating a reversal of the previous trends. The recent rise in new infections was particularly strong in France's eastern Alsace region, one of the zones that suffered most during the start of the pandemic, where authorities recorded well over 1000 new cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

"In Germany, new cases have also risen in recent days, reaching a new record of around 220 000 average new cases over the last 7 days, according to data compiled by the Robert-Koch-Institut."

And as to what is happening in the US, read https://mobile.twitter.com/JReinerMD from 20 Mar 2022, retweeted by Jonathan Reiner as communicated by Mary Marshall: "Wastewater is our COVID early warning system. As many as 35% of monitoring sites are showing a rise in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the last week there's been a 26% increase in the number of sites (red dots) noting 1000% increase in wastewater levels. Here are the places where RNA levels are rising." Go to URL to see map showing locations in US with increased levels of SARS CoV RNA in waste water.

[2] COVID impact on cancer survival
Date: Mon 21 Mar 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/delayed-cancer-care-amid-covid-19-may-raise-death-rates


A pair of studies today [Mon 21 Mar 2022] estimated the COVID-19 pandemic's potential effects on cancer deaths, with one predicting rising US cancer deaths over the next decade owing to screening deficits, and the other suggesting that cancer surgery delays in Ontario could lead to poorer survival rates.

To accommodate surges of critically ill COVID-19 patients, many healthcare facilities around the world canceled or delayed appointments for other indications, including cancer. Before COVID-19 vaccines were available, patients with nonemergent [sic. non-urgent? - Mod.SH] conditions also were advised to stay home rather than risk infection in crowded hospitals or clinics.

The unintended consequences of these public health measures are still being measured.

Median 18% drop in colorectal cancer screening
----------------------------------------------
In the first study, published in Cancer, a team led by Northwestern University researchers conducted a national quality-improvement (QI) study on the return to cancer screening among 748 accredited US cancer programs from April through June [2021]. They used prepandemic and pandemic monthly screening test volumes (MTVs) to identified screening gaps. [ref: Joung RH, Nelson H, Mullett TW, et al. A national quality improvement study identifying and addressing cancer screening deficits due to the COVID- 19 pandemic. Cancer. First published: 21 March 2022 https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.34157]

Most facilities reported gaps in monthly screenings for colorectal cancer (104 of 129 [80.6%]), cervical cancer (20/29 [69%]), breast cancer (241/436 [55.3%]), and lung cancer (98/220 [44.6%]). The median relative changes in MTVs were -17.7% for colorectal cancer, -6.8% for cervical cancer, -1.6% for breast cancer, and 1.2% for lung cancer. No geographic differences were seen.

These findings prompted participating cancer programs to start 814 QI projects to break down barriers to cancer screening, including screening resources. While the effects of these projects on screening rates through 2021 are still being evaluated, the estimated numbers of potential MTVs, should all facilities reach their target goals, could be 57 141 for breast cancer, 6079 for colorectal cancer, 4280 for cervical cancer, and 1744 for lung cancer.

"Cancer screening is still in need of urgent attention, and the screening resources made available online may help facilities to close critical gaps and address screenings missed in 2020," the researchers wrote.

In a press release from Wiley, publisher of the journal, corresponding author Heidi Nelson, MD, of the American College of Surgeons, said that the team hopes that the QI Eprograms will prevent many cancer deaths. [EurekAlert https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/946326] "From the perspective of what this means about our programs, we now know that we can turn to our accredited programs in times of crisis to help address large-scale cancer problems," she said. "Knowing how enthusiastic these accredited programs are for working collaboratively on national level problems, we expect to release one or 2 quality improvement projects each year going forward."

10-year survival could fall up to 0.9%
--------------------------------------
To assess the effect of COVID-19-related cancer surgery delays on survival, University of Toronto researchers built a microsimulation model using real-world population data on cancer care in Ontario from 2019 and 2020.

The study, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ), estimated cancer surgery wait times over the first 6 months of the pandemic by simulating a slowdown in operating room capacity (60% operating room resources in month 1, 70% in month 2, and 85% in months 3-6), compared with simulated prepandemic conditions with 100% resources. [ref: Parmar A, Eskander A, Sander B, et al. CMAJ March 21, 2022 194 (11) E408-E414; DOI: https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.202380]

The model population consisted of 22 799 patients awaiting cancer surgery before the pandemic and 20 177 new referrals. Average wait time to surgery before the pandemic was 25 days, compared with 32 days after. As a result, 0.01 -- 0.07 life-years were lost per patient across cancer types, translating to 843 life-years lost among cancer patients.

The largest percentages of life-years lost were among patients with nonprostate genitourinary (0.07 life-years lost), gastrointestinal (0.05), and head and neck cancers (0.05), all of which carry a high risk of death. Ten-year survival fell by 0.3% to 0.9% across all studied cancer types in the pandemic model compared with the prepandemic era, with the greatest change in patients with hepatobiliary cancers (26% before vs 25.1% after).

In a scenario of a 60% reduction in surgical resources for cancer patients in the first 6 months of the pandemic, incremental increases in wait time of 10 to 21 days over prepandemic wait times translated to 0.1 to 0.11 life-years lost per patient and reductions in 10-year survival of 0.3 to 1.6 percentage points across cancer types. The changes indicate the loss of 1539 life-years.

In a different scenario in which surgical resources were reduced to 60% for the first 2 months of the pandemic and raised to 75% for the next 4 months, wait times were shorter than under the first scenario (incremental increase, 8 to 19 days), leading to the loss of fewer (1306) life-years.

The study authors called for future studies to characterize the additional impact of pandemic-related diagnostic delays and changes in cancer stage on cancer survival. "Pandemic-related slowdowns of cancer surgeries were projected to result in decreased long-term survival for many patients with cancer," they wrote. "Measures to preserve surgical resources and health care capacity for affected patients are critical to mitigate unintended consequences."

[A] Alcohol deaths during pandemic

Alcohol-related deaths increased by 25% in the United States during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a new study in JAMA based on data from the National Center for Health Statistics.

Several studies have shown that alcohol use increased during the first month of COVID-19 lockdowns, but this study showed that deaths related to overconsumption of alcohol jumped from 2019 to 2020, from 78 927 to 99 017 [relative change, 25.5%]), as did the age-adjusted rate (from 27.3 to 34.4 per 100 000 [relative change, 25.9%]).

Alcohol-related deaths accounted for 2.8% of all deaths in 2019 and 3% in 2020. The findings echo previous studies on opioid use during the pandemic, which found that opioid overdose deaths increased 38% in 2020.

Though rates of alcohol-related deaths increased similarly among men and women, there were significant increases for people aged 35 to 44 years (from 22.9 to 32 per 100 000 [39.7%]) and 25 to 34 years (from 11.8 to 16.1 per 100 000 [37%]).

"The rate increase for alcohol-related deaths in 2020 outpaced the increase in all-cause mortality, which was 16.6%," the authors wrote. "Deaths involving alcohol reflect hidden tolls of the pandemic. Increased drinking to cope with pandemic-related stressors, shifting alcohol policies, and disrupted treatment access are all possible contributing factors."

[B] Repeat rapid antigen testing

The estimated overall accuracy of a 2nd COVID-19 rapid antigen test among asymptomatic New York City workers was 94% in a comparative effectiveness study published late last week in JAMA Network Open. The study authors noted that while the gold-standard diagnostic test for COVID-19 is real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), rapid antigen tests are often used to screen asymptomatic populations because they produce results faster and are less expensive.

"Although rapid antigen tests have been criticized for poor sensitivity and specificity when screening asymptomatic patients, a knowledge gap still remains regarding the utility of these tests for screening," they wrote.

Led by a Weill Cornell Medicine researcher, the team tested 179 127 participants in a workplace screening program using Sofia2 SARS Antigen Fluorescent Immunoassay, LumiraDX, and BinaxNow tests at an international service company from November 2020 through October 2021. Median employee age was 36 years, and 58% were men.

Of the 179 127 antigen tests performed, 623 (0.35%) yielded positive results, of which 238 (38%) were confirmed to be positive through RT-qPCR, and 385 (62%) were found to be false-positive.

Among the 623 positive antigen test results, 569 (91%) were followed by a 2nd such test. Of 224 pairs of consecutive antigen tests with positive results, RT-qPCR results were positive for 207 (92%). In the 345 cases with a first positive antigen test followed by a negative test, 328 (95%) were negative on RT-qPCR. Total estimated accuracy of a repeat antigen test was 94%.

"The results of this study demonstrated that when a repeated rapid antigen test was offered to participants of an employee screening program, the estimated accuracy increased from 38% to 92% for true-positive results as determined by RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2," the authors wrote.

A 2nd antigen test may be useful for guiding COVID-19 interventions, the researchers said. "These findings may have important implications for how rapid antigen tests can be deployed for more accurate results, especially in a setting where the time to results is important and where widespread PCR testing may be cost prohibitive," they concluded.

- The European region reported 41.5% of cases and 32.2% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most severely affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 193.66 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Belgium (21 cases), Portugal, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 25 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, no countries reported more than 100 000 cases, 9 reported more than 10 000, 14 reported over 1000 cases, and 2 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Americas region (the 2nd most severely affected region) reported 6.7% of cases and 21.5% deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 149.76 million cases. Brazil reported 44 154 cases followed by and Chile. An additional 5 countries reported more than 1000 cases (Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Uruguay) in the past 24 hours. Peru, Colombia, and Cuba reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. The USA, Canada, and Bolivia among others did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 2% of daily case numbers and 6.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.51 million cases. Jordan (9135) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Egypt (5516), both after many days of zero reporting, Iran and Bahrain. Occupied Palestinian Territory reported more than 500 but less than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.11% of daily cases and only 5 total deaths during the past 24 hours having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.52 million cases. South Africa (889) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours, while most of remaining countries reported below 100 or 50 cases. A total of 29 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours. The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the region as vaccine coverage remains low.

- The Western Pacific region reported 46.6% of daily case numbers and 30.6% deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 36.98 million cases. South Korea (407 017) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Vietnam, Japan, Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, China, Singapore, and Brunei.
