The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that a variant of COVID-19 behind the acceleration of India's explosive outbreak has been found in dozens of countries all over the world.

The UN health agency on Wed 12 May 2021 said the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus, 1st found in India in October 2020, had been detected in more than 4500 samples uploaded to an open-access database "from 44 countries in all 6 WHO regions."

Many mosques in India turned into COVID centres amid the virus surge, "and WHO has received reports of detections from 5 additional countries," it said in its weekly epidemiological update on the pandemic.

Outside of India, it said the United Kingdom had reported the largest number of COVID-19 cases caused by the variant.

Earlier this week, the WHO declared B.1.617 -- which counts 3 so-called sub-lineages with slightly different mutations and characteristics -- as a "variant of concern."

It was, therefore, added to the list containing 3 other variants of COVID-19, those 1st detected in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.

The variants are seen as more dangerous than the original version of the virus because they are either being more transmissible, deadly or able to get past some vaccine protections.

The WHO explained that B.1.617 was added to the list because it appears to be more transmissible than the original virus, pointing to the "rapid increases in prevalence in multiple countries."

WHO also pointed to "preliminary evidence" that the variant was more resistant to treatment with the monoclonal antibody Bamlanivimab and also highlighted early laboratory studies indicating "limited reduction in neutralisation by antibodies."

It stressed, though, that "real-world impacts" on the effectiveness of vaccines against the variant for instance "may be limited."

WHO said the spread of B.1.617, alongside other more transmittable variants, appeared to be one of several factors driving India's dramatic surge in new cases and deaths.

India -- a country of 1.35 billion people -- is the world's 2nd-most infected after the United States, with nearly 23 million COVID-19 cases, and is currently recording more than 300 000 new cases and close to 4000 deaths each day.

The new surge in cases has ravaged main cities, including the capital New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai, pushing hospitals to the breaking point and leading to severe shortages of medical oxygen and beds.

"WHO found that resurgence and acceleration of COVID-19 transmission in India had several potential contributing factors, including increase in the proportion of cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially increased transmissibility," it said.

It also pointed to "several religious and political mass gathering events which increased social mixing and under use of and reduced adherence to public health and social measures."

"The exact contributions of each of these factors on increased transmission in India are not well understood."

WHO stressed that so far, only 0.1 percent of positive coronavirus tests in India had been genetically sequenced and uploaded to the GISAID database to identify the variant in question.

By the end of April 2021, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 accounted for 21 and 7 percent, respectively, of all sequenced samples from India, it said.

In addition, other more contagious variants are also spreading in the country, including B.1.1.7, which was 1st detected in the UK.

[B] India: variants
Date: Tue 11 May 2021

Scientists are working to understand several coronavirus variants now circulating in India, where a ferocious 2nd wave of COVID-19 has devastated the nation and caught authorities unawares. The country recorded nearly 400 000 new infections on 9 May 2021, taking its total to more than 22 million.

Evidence is growing that one variant 1st detected in India might be more transmissible and slightly better at evading immunity than existing variants. Animal models also hint that it might be able to cause more severe disease. Researchers want to know whether this variant and others might be driving the 2nd wave and what kind of danger they pose globally.

In just a few weeks, the B.1.617 variant has become the dominant strain across India and has spread to about 40 nations, including the United Kingdom, Fiji and Singapore.

Two weeks ago, it looked as if multiple variants were behind a series of surges in India. Genomic data indicated that B.1.1.7, 1st identified in the United Kingdom, was dominant in Delhi and the state of Punjab, and a new variant dubbed B.1.618 was present in West Bengal. B.1.617 was dominant in Maharashtra.

But since then, B.1.617 has overtaken B.1.618 in West Bengal, has become the leading variant in many states, and is increasing rapidly in Delhi. "In some states, the surge can be tied to 617," Sujeet Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, based in New Delhi, told journalists on 5 May 2021.

Some say this could indicate that the variant is highly transmissible. "Its prevalence has increased over other variants in much of India, suggesting that it has better fitness over those variants," says Shahid Jameel, a virologist at Ashoka University in Sonipat who chairs the scientific advisory group of the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequencing Consortia (INSACOG).

The World Health Organization (WHO) has designated B.1.617 a variant of concern. Variants are classified in this way when there is evidence that they spread more rapidly, cause more severe disease, or evade previously acquired immunity better than do circulating versions of the virus. On 7 May 2021, the UK government declared the B.1.617.2 subtype a variant of concern in the United Kingdom. It revealed that recorded B.1.617.2 infections in the country had risen from 202 to 520 in a single week.

Several other variants of concern have had a significant impact globally. These include B.1.351, which was identified in South Africa in late 2020; studies suggesting that the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is less effective against that variant led to the nation suspending its roll-out. Similarly, the P.1 variant, which is able to evade some immunity, contributed to a major 2nd wave in Brazil early this year [2021]. And the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 strain emerged in the United Kingdom in late 2020 and led to a surge of cases there and elsewhere.

Data on B.1.617 are only just trickling out, but a mosaic of findings hints that it has an edge over variants already circulating in India.

Indian scientists 1st detected B.1.617 in a few samples in October 2020. INSACOG ramped up surveillance in late January 2021 in response to a rising number of variants, and scientists noticed that B.1.617 was on the rise in Maharashtra. By mid-February 2021, it accounted for 60% of cases there, says Priya Abraham, director of the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune. Since then, multiple sub-lineages have emerged.

In a detailed genomic and structural analysis of B.1.617 published as a preprint on 3 May 2021, NIV scientists identified 8 mutations in the virus's spike protein, through which it gains entry to cells. Two of them look similar to mutations that have allowed other variants of concern to become more transmissible, and a 3rd resembles a mutation that might have allowed P.1 to partially evade immunity.

The genomics work was backed up days later by a preprint from a team in Germany which shows that B.1.617 is moderately better than an earlier variant at entering human intestine and lung cells in the lab.

It is unclear whether this "minor" advantage could lead to more spread in the real world, says lead author Markus Hoffman, an infection biologist at the Leibniz Institute for Primate Research in Gottingen.

Small studies in animals suggest that the variant could cause more severe disease. In a 5 May 2021 preprint, a team led by virologist Pragya Yadav at the NIV found that hamsters infected with B.1.617 had more inflammation in their lungs than did animals infected with other variants.

Gupta says this research shows that B.1.617 has enhanced potential to cause disease. But he cautions that "it's difficult to extrapolate from hamsters to humans," and says that data on disease severity in people are needed.

Research from Gupta's own lab suggests that antibodies are slightly less effective against the variant than against others. The team collected blood serum from 9 people who had received one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and tested it against a harmless carrier virus modified to contain the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, with the mutations from B.1.617. Serum from vaccinated individuals typically contains antibodies that can block, or neutralize, the virus and prevent cells from getting infected.

Gupta's team discovered that neutralizing antibodies generated by the vaccinated individuals were about 80% less potent against some of the mutations in B.1.617, although this would not render vaccination ineffective, he says. The researchers also found that some healthcare workers in Delhi who had been vaccinated with Covishield, an Indian version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, had become reinfected, with most cases tied to B.1.617.

Similarly, the German team tested serum from 15 people who had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and found that their antibodies neutralized B.1.617 about 50% less effectively than previously circulating strains. When they tested serum from participants who'd had 2 shots of the Pfizer vaccine, they found that the antibodies were about 67% less potent against B.1.617.

Two other small studies, one from Yadav's team testing the Covaxin vaccine made by Indian firm Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad, and an as-yet-unpublished study on Covishield, showed that the vaccines continue to work. But Yadav observed small drops in the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies generated by the Covaxin vaccine.

The B.1.617 variant does seem to have an advantage over previously circulating versions of the virus, especially in individuals whose immunity is waning a while after previous infection or vaccination, says Hoffman.

But Gupta cautions that these lab studies all involve small groups and show smaller drops in antibody effectiveness, compared with what has been seen with other variants of concern and also warns that experiments in serum are not always a good guide to whether a variant can evade immunity from a vaccine in the real world. Vaccines can cause the production of vast quantities of antibodies, so a dip in potency might not be significant.

Furthermore, other parts of the immune system, such as T cells, might not be affected. For example, the B.1.351 variant has been linked to much steeper drops in the potency of neutralizing antibodies, but studies in humans suggest that many vaccines remain highly effective against that variant, particularly at preventing severe disease.

For these reasons, the vaccines are likely to remain effective against B.1.617 and to limit severe disease. "The vaccine is still working," says Yadav. "If you get vaccinated, you "will be protected, and the severity will be less."

Nevertheless, "the surge in cases in India and scenes witnessed there are of grave concern internationally," Nick Loman, a microbial genomicist and bioinformatician at the University of Birmingham, UK, told the Science Media Centre in London after the United Kingdom declared B.1.617.2 a variant of concern. "This variant will now be one to watch carefully."

Ravindra Gupta, a virologist at the University of Cambridge, UK agrees that it is "highly likely to be more transmissible."

[C] US: Variant B.1.617 spreading
Date: Fri 14 May 2021
Source: NPR [abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/2021/05/14/996956000/coronavirus-variant-from-india-appears-to-be-spreading-in-the-u-s


Interview:
Rob Stein [NPR correspondent]: So, you know, the variant that was 1st spotted in the U.K. [B.1.1.7] is still the dominant strain in the United States. But the one 1st spotted in India [B.1.617] seems to be on the rise and could already be starting to overtake some of the other variants that have been circulating in the country. According to the latest CDC estimate, this B1617 variant may have increased from about 1% of infections to more than 3% nationally. And it may be way more common than that in some parts of the country. The CDC estimates it could account for more than 10% of infections in the New York, New Jersey area and more than 17% of infections in some Western states, you know, like Colorado, Montana, Utah, Wyoming and the Dakotas. I talked about this with Dr. Jeremy Luban at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

Jeremy Luban: It looks like the 617 is gaining ground. It's outcompeting the other viruses. It's replacing whatever variants were there before. And it's always a concern when something like this changes, because we don't know what will happen.

Rob Stein: ...this variant looks like it could be the most contagious one yet to come along. So, you know, it could just ratchet up the pandemic again in this country if it starts spreading, you know, widely. Now, the good news is that the vaccines look like they probably work really well against it, especially at protecting people from getting really sick and dying, which is the most important thing, but maybe just not quite as well at preventing any infections at all. But the immunity the vaccines do provide may not last as long, so we may need boosters sooner. And people may also not be as protected from infection if they had already been infected with one of the earlier strains, so they may be more vulnerable to this one.

[D] UK: B.1.617 could lead to 3rd wave
Date: Fri 14 May 2021
Source: The Guardian [abridged, edited]
https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/14/india-covid-variant-could-lead-to-3rd-wave-uk?__twitter_impression=true


It was all looking so good. After a brutal 2nd wave in the winter, the lockdown combined with the swift rollout of vaccines forced infections, hospitalisations and deaths down to levels not seen since last summer [2020]. The vaccines performed better than expected, not only in preventing deaths, but in hampering the spread of the virus. Scientific advisers were confident about England's cautious roadmap back to a life more normal: the worst, it seemed, was over.

Now, those same advisers are deeply worried that the new variant of concern from India, B.1.617.2, could undermine the hard-won achievement. The government strategy has been to ease restrictions as vaccines reach more people, aiming for a delicate balance that opens up society while preventing another wave that overwhelms the NHS.

Without the new variant, outbreak modellers advising Sage anticipated a modest 3rd wave in July and August [2021], with perhaps 4000 to 11 000 more deaths, but nothing on the scale of the devastating winter wave.

But the new variant is here. What that means is still uncertain. Take the outbreak in Bolton and surrounding areas out of the picture and the situation in England looks far less alarming, suggesting the region may be an outlier. Yet some scientists working on B.1.617.2 believe it is destined to displace the dominant and highly transmissible Kent variant, B.1.1.7, in the UK and note that charts displaying the steep rise in cases look horribly similar to those that tracked the surge of the Kent variant in December 2020.

Their concerns are backed by the Sage committee, which advised ministers on 5 May 2021 that pushing down cases of variant infections was now a "priority for policy." A highly transmissible variant -- one that spreads more easily than the Kent variant -- "could lead to a very significant wave of infections, potentially larger than that seen in January 2021 if there were no interventions," the experts said.

Epidemiologists are still wrestling with how transmissible the India variant of concern is. Public Health England believes it is at least as transmissible as the Kent variant, but preliminary work based on genome sequencing in India raises the prospect of it spreading up to 60% more easily.

To get some idea of what a faster-spreading variant could mean for the months ahead, modelling teams that feed into Sage worked up different scenarios. Assuming the vaccines hold up, more people could be hospitalised than in the 1st wave, putting the NHS at risk, if the variant is much more than 30% more transmissible, University of Warwick models show. At 40% more transmissible, hospitalisations could reach 6000 per day, far above the peak of the 2nd wave, and 10 000 per day if the variant is 50% more transmissible.

That is if we do nothing. If step 3 easing of restrictions in England on Mon 17 May 2021 is cancelled, the 3rd wave will be far more modest, reaching 300 hospitalisations per day, even if the virus spreads 50% more easily than the Kent version. Holding off on step 4 on 21 Jun 2021 may be less effective: under that scenario, a variant little more than 40% more transmissible could trigger more daily hospitalisations than seen in either UK waves so far.

A 3rd wave of the coronavirus will drive people into hospital despite the mass vaccination programme. While the vast majority of older and more vulnerable people have been inoculated, the vaccines are not 100% protective, and do not work in everyone. As a result, scientific advisers expect many of those hospitalised in the 3rd wave to be vaccinated, just not well protected from their shots.

Millions more have not yet been called for their jabs. Among those will be people unaware they are clinically vulnerable. And so more deaths will duly follow. Modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, seen by Sage on 5 May 2021, found that a 50% more transmissible variant could trigger a 3rd wave with deaths peaking at 1000 per day in late July 2021. We have not seen those kinds of numbers since February 2021.

Deaths are not all that matters. The decision to vaccinate older people 1st was based on saving lives and preventing the collapse of the NHS. The trade-off is more infections in younger, healthy people, and while they are much less likely to die from the disease, they are at real risk of long Covid, in which patients continue to suffer from fatigue, brain fog and other debilitating symptoms long after they have overcome the virus itself.

So far, surge testing for B.1.617.2 and telling infected people and their contacts to isolate has not brought the variant under control, but it is a crucial part of the effort.

Beyond this, ministers are looking to ramp up vaccinations in outbreak areas. In theory, this could help by getting jabs to the old and vulnerable who have so far not come forward, and by slowing transmission, particularly if the vaccines are given to younger people who mix more.

But the protection from a vaccine comes 2 to 3 weeks after having the shot, by which time the variant may have spread far beyond the main clusters to areas where cases are still low. It may backfire if vaccines are diverted from low case regions to where the variant is now rife. The decision for ministers is how best to use the vaccine, and the answer is not straightforward.

[2] Performance of Saliva, Oropharyngeal Swabs, and Nasal Swabs for SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Detection
Date: May 2021
Source: JCM [edited]
https://jcm.asm.org/content/59/5/e02881-20


Abstract
"Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs are considered the highest-yield sample for diagnostic testing for respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs. We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval 1 Oct 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types (saliva, oropharyngeal [OP], and nasal [NS] swabs) versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in subgroups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias. From 1253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. 3 specimen types captured lower % positives (NS [82%, 95% CI: 73 to 90%], OP [84%, 95% CI: 57 to 100%], and saliva [88%, 95% CI: 81 to 93%]) than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (97%, 95% CI: 90 to 100%). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield of positive samples. NP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric versus adult, late versus early in disease course), such that head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.

Saliva is the subject of the largest body of research on alternative specimen types, as well as the specimen of choice for numerous companies putting high-volume testing programs in place. The pathophysiological rationale for saliva sampling is based on the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) being the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (1), similar to SARS-CoV. High ACE-2 receptor expression in oral mucosa and salivary glands has been recently demonstrated (2). Certain regions of the world, such as Hong Kong, have already adopted saliva in their mass screening protocols [3].

The authors conclude "Overall, much remains unknown about the impact on diagnostic sensitivity of variations in specimen collection and processing protocols, and performance in specific key subpopulations (asymptomatic versus symptomatic, pediatric versus adult, late versus early testing from symptom onset). Timing of sampling from symptom onset was also quite variable (collection occurred within days to weeks in some studies), and was inconsistently reported, which likely had a major impact on diagnostic performance, given decreasing viral load over time. Head-to-head studies are urgently needed of flocked versus unflocked swabs (and specialized versus unspecialized swabs for MT collection), collected at different times in disease and with different sampling methods, and also in important subpopulations (e.g., children), to resolve the persistent uncertainty.

"In summary, while alternative specimens (particularly saliva and OP/NS samples) show promise, we find that the literature to date suggests that NP swabs are indeed the gold standard in comparison to alternative specimen types (saliva, OP swab, NS). We identify self-collected nasal swabs and saliva to have similar performance to health care worker-obtained specimens, which is also supported by a head-to-head comparison of self-collected AN versus professionally collected NP swabs utilizing an antigen rapid test for detection (75). We reiterate that the LOD of any assay will impact detection and centers should be aware of the increased possibility of false negatives with any sample type when using a less sensitive assay. Given the promising results of combined oropharyngeal and nasal swab studies, more studies on alternative specimen combinations would be useful. Lastly, we encourage future studies to provide more clarity about exact details of collection procedures, specific swab shape and materials used, sample processing methods (dilution, extraction, storage, transport), and the NAAT assay utilized (including LOD), allowing the field to clearly define the trade-offs required to sufficiently bring SARS-CoV-2 testing to scale."

[3] Unusual coronavirus (COVID-19) symptoms
Date: Thu 18 Mar 2021

https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/expert-answers/coronavirus-unusual-symptoms/faq-20487367


Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause a wide range of signs and symptoms. The most common are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Other symptoms include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle aches, chills, sore throat, runny nose, headache, or chest pain. But COVID-19 can also cause symptoms you might not expect, including:

- Gastrointestinal symptoms. COVID-19 might cause nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, either alone or with other COVID-19 symptoms. Gastrointestinal symptoms sometimes develop before a fever and respiratory symptoms.

- Loss of smell or taste. A new loss of smell or taste -- without nasal congestion -- is a common early symptom of COVID-19. Research suggests that most changes in smell and taste often resolve in 30 days. In some people, however, moderate to severe changes in smell and taste can persist for 60 days or more.

- Skin changes. The most common skin changes linked with mild to severe COVID-19 include a flat, red rash covered with small bumps, discolored areas on the fingers and toes (COVID toes) and hives.

- COVID toes appear to be more common in children and young adults. Swelling or discoloration can develop on one or several toes or fingers. Blisters, itchiness, rough skin, pain or painful raised bumps can occur. A small amount of pus might develop under the skin. The symptom can last 10 to 14 days or for months. However, swollen, discolored fingers or toes could also be chilblains, an inflammatory skin condition. Chilblains develop in response to repeated exposure to cold air.

- Confusion. Severe confusion (delirium) might be the main or only symptom of COVID-19 in older people. This COVID-19 symptom is linked with a high risk for poor outcomes, including death.

- Eye problems. Pink eye (conjunctivitis) can be a symptom of COVID-19. Research suggests that the most common eye problems linked to COVID-19 are light sensitivity, sore eyes, and itchy eyes.

Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus and can range from mild to severe. If you think you might be experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, call your doctor.
