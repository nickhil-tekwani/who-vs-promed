Federal health officials [from the CDC have attributed another death to a
rare strain of bacteria that also has been found in meat products from Bil
Mar Foods, making this the third most deadly outbreak of listeriosis in the
past 20 years.
Tuesday's report boosts the total to 10 deaths nationwide, as the outbreak
continues to worsen.
Officials at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta are also blaming
the rare strain of _Listeria_ (pattern E) for three miscarriages and more
than 60 illnesses in a 13-state area.
Spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said the CDC has begun releasing daily, rather
than weekly, updates on the outbreak as the numbers continue to increase
and media interest continues to grow.
In Michigan, state health officials say five people have been sickened from
that same strain of _Listeria_, which causes flu-like symptoms in healthy
adults, but can kill the elderly and children with weak immune systems.
County health departments in West Michigan report that two women, an
18-year-old n and a 75-year-old have been sickened from the disease.
The CDC pinpointed the rare pattern E, responsible for less than 5 percent
of all _Listeria_ illnesses, last fall after testing people who had become
sick. It also pinpointed pattern E in packages of opened and unopened hot
dogs and cold cuts made by Bil Mar in Ottawa County.
That prompted a $70 million voluntary nationwide recall on Dec. 22. Bil Mar
officials halted shipments, stopped production, set up a toll-free consumer
hotline, 1-800-247-8339, and began cleaning and testing their Borculo
processing plant. The USDA also has a hotline for information:
1-800-535-4555.
