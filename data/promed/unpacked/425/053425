The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is advising consumers not to eat recreationally harvested mussels and clams, commercially or recreationally caught anchovy and sardines, or the internal organs of commercially or recreationally caught crab taken from Monterey and Santa Cruz counties. CDPH is working with commercial fisherman in the area to ensure that recently harvested anchovy and sardines were not distributed into the human food supply.

Dangerous levels of domoic acid have been detected in some of these species and are also likely to be present in the other species. Molluscan bivalve shellfish, anchovy, and sardines are especially of concern because the toxin resides in their digestive tract and these seafood products are normally not eviscerated prior to consumption.

CDPH is continuing to collect a variety of molluscan bivalve shellfish, fin fish, and crab samples from the area to monitor the level of domoic acid.

This warning does not apply to commercially sold clams, mussels, scallops, or oysters from approved sources. State law permits only state-certified commercial shellfish harvesters or dealers to sell these products. Shellfish sold by certified harvesters and dealers are subject to frequent mandatory testing to monitor for toxins.

Symptoms of domoic acid poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to 24 hours after eating toxic seafood. In mild cases, symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, headache, and dizziness. These symptoms disappear within several days. In severe cases, the victim may experience trouble breathing, confusion, disorientation, cardiovascular instability, seizures, excessive bronchial secretions, permanent loss of short-term memory (a condition known as amnesic shellfish poisoning), coma, or death. There have been no reported illnesses associated with this event.

[Domoic acid is a cyanotoxin associated with certain algal blooms and possibly produced by the diatom (a kind of phytoplankton) of the genus _Pseudo-nitzschia_ (for an image go to https://ec0l0gical.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/pseudonitzschia.jpg?w=700).

The toxic acid is accumulated by marine organisms feeding on phytoplankton, anchovies, sardines, and shellfish. In mammals (including humans), domoic acid is essentially a neurotoxin in mammals causing brain damage, neurological dysfunction, and death in severe cases.

In Monterey bay there was an episode of bird die-off caused after a bloom of _Pseudo-nitzschia australis_ in 1991.
