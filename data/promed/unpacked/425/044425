Sclerotinia stem rot is taking a toll on canola crops in parts of the southern cropping region where the disease has infected individual crops by as much as 60 per cent. The disease, which can result in yield losses of up to 30 per cent, has been detected in parts of southern New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

Kurt Lindbeck, funded by Grains Research and Development Corporation [GRDC], says a combination of factors has led to widespread and damaging sclerotinia stem rot this year [2013]. "Conditions over winter favoured spore production and development of the disease," he said. "We had frequent rainfall events through the flowering period for canola."

"Inoculum [was] building up over the past couple of seasons. With the right environmental conditions, it doesn't take much for outbreaks to occur." He said the increased intensity of canola cropping was adding to the disease pressure.

To minimise the risk of sclerotinia, Mr Lindbeck advises to avoid paddocks which have had moderate to high levels of sclerotinia over the past 3 years. Low-risk break crops such as field peas and faba beans should be considered. "It is also important to ensure the seed is free of sclerotia." Timing of fungicide application is critical. Often, the fungicides are applied too late, resulting in poor sclerotinia control.

[Sclerotinia of oilseed rape (also called stem rot, white mould), is caused by _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. The fungus is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known hosts worldwide, including many crop species. It causes white fungal growth on aerial plant parts which leads to rotting, wilting, and death of plants. On oilseed rape (including canola cultivars), infected leaves collapse around the stem, then stem lesions showing a typical bleached appearance develop.

The pathogen is primarily soilborne and has a complex disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia for up to 10 years and is also spread by infected plant material, mechanical means, and windborne spores. It is thought that the fungus may also survive in the soil by colonising the roots of other plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for crops. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history of a field as well as weather conditions.

Disease management includes cultural practices (such as long term crop rotation with non-hosts and deep ploughing to minimise inoculum) and fungicide applications. However, fungicides may not be very effective against soilborne fungal pathogens.

An outbreak of oilseed rape sclerotinia earlier in 2013 in Western Australia (ProMED-mail post 20131020.2011643) has been reported as the worst on record in that state.
