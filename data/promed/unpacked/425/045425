The Butte County Public Health (BCPH) Department announced on Friday [24 Sep 2021] that it is investigating a case of wound botulism suffered by a Butte County resident who injected drugs, including black tar heroin. The department says a lab test to confirm the diagnosis is pending and the source of the heroin is unknown.

However, the department said in a press release that black tar heroin has been linked to other wound botulism cases and outbreaks connected to injection drug users, so there is concern that the black tar heroin available in Butte County may be contaminated. The department has also issued a health advisory to area providers to promote rapid diagnosis and reporting, and it has conducted outreach and provided information to homeless shelters, drug treatment facilities and other locations that serve persons who may be at risk of wound botulism. According to the department, this would be the 3rd case of wound botulism in the county in 2021. California has the highest rate of wound botulism in the country.

Wound botulism occurs when a wound becomes infected with _Clostridium botulinum_ (the cause of foodborne botulism) or a closely related _Clostridium_ bacterium, BCPH said. The department said that the bacteria multiply in the wound and create a toxin that acts on the nerves, and added most, but not all, people with wound botulism will have a visibly infected wound. Persons injecting black tar heroin into their muscles ("muscling") or under their skin ("skin popping") are at the highest risk of wound botulism.

The department added those infected cannot transmit the illness to others. The department said that symptoms occur within days or weeks of injecting contaminated drugs and may be mistaken for a drug overdose. Symptoms can include weak or drooping eyelids, blurred or double vision, dry mouth, sore throat, slurred speech, trouble swallowing, difficulty breathing and a progressive symmetric paralysis that begins at the face and head and travels down the body. If left untreated, symptoms may progress to paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs and trunk, followed by death. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to decreasing the severity and duration of illness. Any injection drug users with symptoms of wound botulism should seek medical attention immediately at the nearest emergency room.

[Most drug-related cases of wound botulism are related to black tar heroin, which is injected subcutaneously instead of intravenously.

Black tar heroin is heroin acetate. "Other forms of heroin require additional steps of purification post acetylation. With black tar, the product's processing stops immediately after acetylation. Its unique consistency, however, is due to acetylation without a reflux apparatus. As in homebake heroin in Australia and New Zealand, the crude acetylation results in a gooey mass. Black tar as a type holds a variable admixture of morphine derivatives -- predominantly 6-MAM (6-monoacetylmorphine), which is another result of crude acetylation. The lack of proper reflux during acetylation fails to remove much of the moisture retained in the acetylating agent, glacial acetic acid.

"Black tar heroin is often produced in Latin America and is most commonly found in the western and southern parts of the USA, while also being occasionally found in western Canada and Europe. It has a varying consistency depending on manufacturing methods, cutting agents, and moisture levels, ranging in quality from a black-brown tarry goo in unrefined form to a uniform, light-brown powder when further processed and cut with lactose."

"People who intravenously inject black tar heroin are at higher risk of venous sclerosis than those who inject powder heroin. In this condition, the veins narrow and harden, which makes repeated injection there nearly impossible." [Researchers at University of California at San Francisco have found that the rapidity with which black tar heroin destroys veins, along with its gummier consistency, may put people who inject it at a lower risk of HIV infection because they may be forced to inject subcutaneously (rather than into veins), and needles must be thoroughly rinsed free of black tar between injections if new sterilized ones are not available. The study has also drawn attention to lower rates of HIV infection among drug injectors in which black tar heroin is the major form of street-available heroin, suggesting that this may be due to the need to heat black tar heroin to dissolve it (which also inactivates any HIV present in the solution) (https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2004/01/97479/black-tar-heroin-use-explains-lower-hiv-levels-among-injection-drug-users).]

"The presence of 6-monoacetylcodeine found in tar heroin has not been tested in humans but has been shown to be toxic alone and more toxic when mixed with mono- or di-acetyl morphine, potentially making tar more toxic than refined diamorphine.

"Black tar heroin injectors can be at increased risk of life-threatening bacterial infections, in particular necrotizing soft tissue infection. The practice of 'skin-popping,' or subcutaneous injection, predisposes to necrotizing fasciitis or necrotizing cellulitis from _Clostridium perfringens_, while deep intramuscular injection predisposes to necrotizing myositis. Tar heroin injection can also be associated with _C. botulinum_ infection" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tar_heroin). - Mod.LL
