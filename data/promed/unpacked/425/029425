Rabid bat bites child at Liberty Lake Park
------------------------------------------
Washington State Public Health Laboratories confirmed [on Wed 8 Jul 2015] that a bat, which bit a child on [4 Jul 2015] at Liberty Lake Regional Park [Spokane County], tested positive for rabies. Officials said the child and the mother, who was not bitten, had contact with the bat and are both receiving vaccines for rabies. Health experts told KREM 2 News this is the 1st case of a rabid bat in Spokane County in 18 years.

"I've actually liked bats if they're in a cage," said the 7 year old who was bit by the bat. [She] and her mom, were scouting out critters at Liberty Lake Regional Park when something caught [her mother's] attention. A bystander pointed out a bat in a tree. The bat then flew off. They said everything was okay until out of nowhere [the girl] started screaming. [The woman] said that when she looked at her daughter, the bat had attached itself to [the child's] thigh. "It didn't want to come off. Its fangs wouldn't come off," she said. "Its little talons and legs came off pretty easily, but his teeth would not let go."

After several heart-pounding seconds, the bat finally flew away. A nearby group of people had captured the bat and [the woman] knew she had to keep the bat as evidence. She then took [her daughter] to the doctor to be treated for the bite. Health experts told her that [the child] will need to get painful rabies shots every week for the next month. Officials said time is of the essence when attempting to prevent rabies following exposure.

The location of the incident was near the marshy area on the south side of the park's designated swimming beach, authorities said. The bat was captured by a separate group at a nearby picnic table, officials said.

Though they do not believe that group had contact with the bat, as a precaution, health officials are urging them to contact Spokane Regional Health District's Zoonotic Disease Program at 509-324-1560 extension 7. Officials said anyone at the park between 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm on [4 Jul 2015], who may have had contact with a bat, should also contact the zoonotic disease staff. "We are being cautious in making absolutely sure that no one was potentially exposed to this bat," said Dr Joel McCullough, a SRHD [Spokane Regional Health District] health officer. "If a person did not have direct contact with the bat, he or she is not at risk for rabies."

The primary animals that carry rabies in the north west United States are bats, but less than one per cent of all bats in the wild are infected with rabies, officials said. Rabid bats have been found in almost every county in Washington. Health officials said this is the 1st report of a rabid bat in Spokane County since 2007.

This recent situation prompted public health officials to warn people across the county to take precautions around bats. Officials said preventing rabies is as simple as avoiding contact with wild animals, educating those at risk, and ensuring adequate pet vaccination and supervision. "Although most bats are harmless and do not carry rabies, people should never handle live or dead bats," Dr McCullough said. "To protect yourself and your loved ones, your safest bet is to simply presume that every bat is rabid."

Health officials said if you come in contact with a bat you should wash any bite or wound with soap or water. They also said you should immediately call the Zoonotic Disease Program, and their own doctor as well.

Girl getting rabies vaccines after being bitten by infected bat
---------------------------------------------------------------
Health district spokeswoman Kim Papich said the girl was at the park with her mother and a friend of her mother's when the bat attacked the girl without provocation. The friend was able to pull the bat off the girl using clothing, but the bat flew away and they lost sight of it.

Soon after, a separate group at the park noticed a bat attacking a picnic table. The bat got stuck in the table and someone trapped the bat with a plastic cup, Papich said. At some point, the mother became aware of the commotion at the picnic table and the bat was turned over to her. Papich said the mother took her daughter to the hospital along with the bat, which still was alive.

Health officials don't believe people in the group who saw the bat at the picnic table came into contact with the bat, but as a precaution they and anyone else at the park Saturday who may have had direct contact with a bat are urged to contact the health district.

"We are being cautious in making absolutely sure that no one was potentially exposed to this bat," said Dr Joel McCullough, the district's health officer, in a news release.

This is the 1st report of a rabid bat in Spokane County since 2007, when 3 bats tested positive for the deadly viral infection. A teenager in eastern Idaho was treated after being bitten by a rabid bat in June 2014. A year before that, 3 rabid bats were found in the Coeur d'Alene area. No one in Washington has died from rabies since 1997, when a man from Mason County was diagnosed after his death. In 1995, a 4 year old in Lewis County died after a bat bite in the child's room went undetected.

Officials say prompt vaccine treatment is highly effective in preventing rabies following exposure. Injections should begin within 14 days after exposure. [Most advise within 10 days or sooner. - Mod.MHJ] The virus is almost always fatal without proper treatment. Symptoms of rabies can take weeks to months to develop after exposure to a rabid animal.

Spokane County parks director Doug Chase said his department was not aware of the incident until he and other park workers were briefed by health district officials on [Wed 8 Jul 2015]. He said the girl's contact with the bat occurred not long after employees who staff the park left for the day.

The primary animals that carry rabies in the north west [United States] are bats, but less than 1 per cent of all bats in the wild are infected with rabies. Last year [2014], 276 bats were tested for rabies in Washington, with 5 per cent identified as positive. Public health officials advise county residents to avoid contact with wild animals and ensure their pets are vaccinated.

If the health district determines that an exposure to a person or pet might have occurred, a bat should, with proper precautions, be tested for rabies. Rabid animals may show unusual behavior and may become aggressive and attempt to bite people, pets and livestock.

[In a real sense the young girl was lucky to have been bitten in this traumatic manner. There was no doubt she had ben exposed. Too often bat exposure is not realised until clinical symptoms begin months later and virus identification indicates it had been from a bat. Too late. At the risk of being repetitive:
- avoid contact with wild animals you don't know, and especially animals out at an unusual time of day and/or demonstrating unusual aggressive or passive behaviour;
- never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to nurse sick animals to health. Call animal control or a properly licensed animal rescue agency for assistance;
- make sure your pets receive the proper immunizations. Dogs and cats should get rabies vaccines by 4 months of age, followed by a booster shot 1 year later and another shot every one or 3 years depending on the type of vaccine used;
- teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly. "Love your own, leave other animals alone," is a good principle for children to learn.

Bats are charming creatures, but always be cautious when handling them or in places infested by them. I speak from experience, having seen multiple species in a Mexican volcanic vent/bat guano mine, collected vampire bats in Brazil and Mexican free-tails in the French Quarter of New Orleans, and seen more than a few colonies in Texas latterly, which is why for years I kept my rabies shots up to date until my doctor persuaded me that my blood titre was quite adequate. - Mod.MHJ]

Rabies cases rise in Kansas
---------------------------
The Kansas Department of Agriculture's Division of Animal Health has identified a an increased number of rabies cases reported in Kansas this year [2015]. As of [30 Jun 2015], 69 cases of rabies have been confirmed in Kansas for 2015.

Rabies testing is performed by the Kansas State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, which confirmed only 69 positive cases in all of 2014. Of the 69 cases reported this year [2015], 13 of them occurred in domestic animals including 9 cattle and 4 cats. These numbers are expected to continue to rise through the end of the year.

Dr Bill Brown, Kansas Animal Health commissioner, urged Kansans to be alert. "Being observant of erratic behavior in wildlife or livestock is important," he said. "Pet owners are urged to follow best practices and vaccinate their pets to prevent this devastating disease."

The previous rabies report from Kansas, dated 30 Jun 2015, listed only 51 confirmed animal cases, 41 of which were skunks. This sudden surge is more likely to be from having processed a backlog of specimens, and points up the significant risk of from animal rabies in that state. - Mod.MHJ]
