Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis Outbreak Caused by Coxsackievirus A24:
Puerto Rico, 2003
--------------------------------------------------
Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is an epidemic form of highly
contagious conjunctivitis and is characterized by sudden onset of painful,
swollen, red eyes, with conjunctival hemorrhaging and excessive tearing.
Since 1981, when AHC was first detected in the Western Hemisphere (1), 3
major epidemics had occurred until 2003, all affecting the Caribbean.
During August to October 2003, a 4th epidemic occurred in Puerto Rico (2000
population: 3.8 million). This report summarizes the outbreak investigation
conducted by the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH), which documented
an estimated 490 000 persons with illness, including >51 000 cases reported
by physicians; demonstrated laboratory evidence of Coxsackievirus A24
(CA24); and determined that school-aged children (i.e., aged 5 to 18 years)
and those living in crowded urban areas were at highest risk. To control
outbreaks of AHC, prevention methods (e.g., frequent hand washing and
avoidance of sharing towels and bedding) should be targeted to groups at
highest risk, and information should be disseminated after the 1st report
of AHC in the area.
For surveillance purposes, PRDOH defines a case of AHC as
physician-diagnosed conjunctivitis. To monitor the level of conjunctivitis,
all health-care providers in Puerto Rico are contacted weekly to determine
case counts of conjunctivitis treated during the week; providers typically
report an average of 500 cases. However, in August 2003, reports of
conjunctivitis increased weekly to a peak of nearly 10 000 during
mid-September; reports returned to baseline in late October [illustrated by
a figure in the original text not reproduced here]. During August to
October 2003, health-care providers reported 51 850 cases of conjunctivitis.
Conjunctival swabs were obtained from a convenience sample of affected
persons from 5 regions. The samples were sent to CDC, where, after testing
negative for bacteria, they were tested for the presence of enterovirus RNA
by using a 5-prime nontranslated region reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. For positive specimens, the enterovirus was
further characterized by RT-PCR amplification of the VP1 region of the
virus and genetic sequencing and then identified as CA24 by comparison with
reference sequences (2,3). Of 26 conjunctival swabs tested, 20 (77 percent)
were positive for enterovirus; of these, 19 were identified as CA24 by VP1
sequencing. The remaining 6 conjunctival swabs were negative for enterovirus.
To further assess disease burden, identify persons at high risk, and
estimate economic impact associated with this outbreak, PRDOH contacted
approximately 340 households by calling randomly selected listed telephone
numbers. One adult in each household was asked about the number and ages of
household members with conjunctivitis. Adults also were asked about their
workdays lost and use of medical services.
A total of 300 (88 percent) households participated in the survey,
representing 902 household members; 114 (13 percent) reported having
conjunctivitis during the outbreak period. The median age of household
members was 21 years (range: 1 to 83 years). The attack rate was higher
among school-aged children than among persons aged >19 years (24 percent
versus 10 percent, respectively) (relative risk [RR] = 2.42; 95 percent
confidence interval [CI] = 1.72--3.40), among those living in urban than in
rural areas (16 percent versus 10 percent, respectively; RR = 1.6; 95
percent CI = 1.18--2.35), and among close contacts of infected persons than
among persons living alone (41 percent versus 6 percent, respectively; RR =
7.47; 95 percent CI = 1.92--29.12). 54 (18 percent) households had at least
one member with conjunctivitis. The attack rate was lowest for one-member
households and increased with household size (correlation coefficient =
0.90; p = 0.005).
Of 34 households with more than one member with conjunctivitis, 20 (59
percent) had an index patient who was of school age; overall, index
patients were significantly younger than secondarily infected patients
(median ages: 22 years versus 30 years; p = 0.034).
A total of 37 adult interviewees with conjunctivitis reported illnesses
lasting a median of 7 days (range: 2 to 14 days); 24 (65 percent) sought
medical care from a physician, 9 (64 percent) of 14 employed interviewees
missed work (median: 3 days; range: 0 to10 days), and 7 (87 percent) of 8
students missed school (median: 2 days; range 0 to 10 days). Based on
survey data, an estimated 490 000 persons (95 percent CI = 403 000 to 570
000) had conjunctivitis during August to October 2003, resulting in a
combined 850 person-years of missed work (not including missed work for
child care, which was not assessed) and 315 000 visits to physicians'
offices. Combined, these factors were estimated to have cost Puerto Rico
$30 million in lost worker production and health-care expenses during the
3-month period.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
Since 1981, the Caribbean islands have had 4 major epidemics of AHC
(1,4,5), including the outbreak described in this report. During the most
recent previous outbreak in 1997, approximately 40 000 cases of AHC were
reported in Puerto Rico (PRDOH, unpublished data, 1997). Immunity to the
infection declines considerably within 7 years (6,7), and this loss of herd
immunity to the virus might have permitted the widespread transmission
observed during the 2003 outbreak.
The outbreak described in this report began in South America in the spring
of 2003, affecting an estimated 200,000 persons in Brazil (8). The outbreak
then moved into Central America and began affecting multiple islands in the
Caribbean during the summer, including Puerto Rico in August (9). No states
or other territories of the United States reported outbreaks of AHC during
August to October 2003 and, since November, no other countries or states
have reported an increase in cases.
AHC typically is caused by one of 2 enteroviruses (CA24 or enterovirus 70).
This disease is transmitted person-to-person usually through contact with
contaminated hands or through sharing of contaminated personal-care items.
No specific treatment is available for AHC; however, the illness is self
limiting, and severe complications are rare. Nonetheless, because of its
extremely contagious nature, AHC can disrupt the local economy and require
substantial health-care resources. This investigation documented increased
health-care use and a substantial impact on workplace productivity in
Puerto Rico, as measured by physician visits and combined years of work missed.
The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations. 1st, the
survey derives estimates for the entire island on the basis of a small
survey sample, which could allow for wide variability. 2nd, the survey
findings might not be representative of the entire population because only
76 percent of households in Puerto Rico have telephones, and 12 percent of
those contacted refused to participate. Because crowding was documented in
this study to be a risk for developing conjunctivitis and crowding might be
more common among those not reached through a telephone survey, the total
number of affected persons might have been underestimated. 3rd, although
the households were selected randomly, the survey of individual members
within the household was based on a convenience sample that might allow for
some biases in the estimations. Finally, the broad case definition of
conjunctivitis might have captured some noninfectious cases of
conjunctivitis, resulting in an overestimation of the total number of
persons affected. However, based on the large number of conjunctivitis
reports relative to the baseline reporting, these noninfectious cases
likely represent a small proportion.
Because the majority of adults are infected as a result of infection among
their school-aged children, targeting future interventions to school-aged
children can help to control spread. In addition to school-aged children,
other groups at high risk (e.g., persons living in crowded urban areas and
household contacts of infected persons) also should be targeted for
prevention messages. Recommended control measures include encouraging
careful and frequent hand washing and avoiding sharing towels, bedding,
makeup, and other personal items with persons with conjunctivitis.
