Yale School of Public Health researchers in collaboration with Russian
scientists have discovered [that a relatively newly described -
Mod.LL] tick-borne bacterium might be causing disease in the USA and
elsewhere. Their finding appear [ahead of print - Mod.LL] in the
journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

This spirochete bacterium called is _Borrelia miyamotoi_, which is
distantly related to _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the bacterium that causes
Lyme disease. Yale professor of epidemiology Durland Fish and
colleagues found this spirochete, previously known only from ticks in
Japan [in 1995 - Mod.LL], in deer ticks in Connecticut in 2001, but
did not know if it caused disease in humans.

The bacteria have since been found in all tick species that transmit
Lyme disease throughout the USA and Europe. By collaborating with a
medical team studying tick-borne diseases in Russia, Yale researchers
were able to compare disease symptoms in patients infected by the new
spirochete in Russia with those having Lyme disease in the USA.

The disease is characterized by high fever, which relapses without
treatment and may be confused with Lyme disease. There are currently
no [commercial - Mod.LL] diagnostic tests available, but Yale
researchers have recently received a grant from the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) to develop a diagnostic test procedure to
look for cases of this new disease in the USA.

The authors report finding _B. miyamotoi_ in about 2 percent of the
deer ticks in the Northeast and Upper Midwest parts of the USA and
have been conducting experiments with mice in the laboratory that
become infected when fed upon by deer ticks. Because bites from deer
ticks cause more than 25 000 cases of Lyme disease each year,
according to the CDC, the Yale team is gearing up to determine if
there is any illness that is caused by _B. miyamotoi_ infection in the
USA.

Although the word "new" occurs multiple times in the original posting
prior to editing, neither is the organism new, being described 16
years ago, nor is the disease it causes, relapsing fever. It is also
not new that this organism, a part of the relapsing fever group of
borreliae, can be found in ixodid ticks. Classical tickborne relapsing
fever, found in the western part of the USA, is spread by a soft tick
of the _Ornithodoros_ genus.

What is relevant here is the description of the manifestations of the
infection in man which appears quite similar to tick-borne relapsing
fever in the USA but the organism could not be found in the Wright
stained peripheral blood. Since the organism can be found in ixodid
ticks in the USA, physicians should be aware that a relapsing fever
presentation in a non-endemic area may be caused by this organism and
not be a manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. It is my experience that
Lyme disease is not often associated with the degree of pyrexia found
in relapsing fever. - Mod.LL]
