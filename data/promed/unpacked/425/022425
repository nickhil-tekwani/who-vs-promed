["Viral hemorrhagic septicemia is caused by the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV or Egtved virus). This virus is a member of the genus Novirhabdovirus, family Rhabdoviridae. Currently, the evidence suggests that VHSV contains a single serotype with 3 subtypes. Both marine and freshwater isolates occur. Marine isolates are indistinguishable from freshwater isolates by routine serology.

Viral hemorrhagic septicemia affects farmed rainbow trout and some other freshwater species in continental Europe and Japan. VHSV has also been isolated from a variety of wild marine fish in North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and the North American part of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This virus has also been reported from Korea.

There is no indication that this disease is a threat to human health". http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/viral_hemorrhagic_septicemia.pdf
