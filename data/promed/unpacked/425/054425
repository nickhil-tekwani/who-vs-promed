In a continuation of the 2015 meningococcal meningitis C outbreak in Tuscany, health officials have reported a dozen cases and 4 deaths through [26 Feb 2016], according to an Italian media account (computer translated).

In 2015, 31 cases, including 6 deaths, attributable to serogroup C were reported. This compares to the 2 and 3 cases reported in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The increase in cases has prompted health officials to extend the vaccination campaign to adolescents, adults and the elderly. In addition, they reiterated that [being in] crowded rooms, alcohol use and smoking habits [sharing cigarettes?] [during an outbreak] of invasive meningococcal disease may increase the risk of infection through close contact with potential carriers.

They did not, however, suggest recommendations against travel to the Tuscany region.

The national system of surveillance of invasive bacterial diseases has not revealed an increase in cases in other Italian regions, neither in 2015 nor in the early months of 2016. However, it could not rule out the spread in other regions.

[The news report posted by ProMED-mail previously on this outbreak in Tuscany (Meningitis, meningococcal - Italy (TC): increased incidence, sg. C 20160210.4009797) noted no deaths in either the past year (2015) or this year (2016). The above news report now says that there were 6 deaths attributable to meningococcal meningitis serogroup C in 2015 and 4 deaths so far this year.

We are not told whether the strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C that are causing the current outbreak in Tuscany have been genotyped. It would be interesting to know whether any of the strains causing the Tuscany outbreak have a matching genotype and whether the genotype matches that causing the international meningococcal meningitis serogroup C outbreak in men who have sex with men. ProMED-mail would appreciate information in this regard from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
