Disease hits Michigan's cucumber crop for 2nd year
--------------------------------------------------
A disease that attacks cucumbers has emerged for a 2nd consecutive growing
season in parts of the state, handing another hardship to Michigan's
agricultural industry.
Downy mildew has been confirmed in Allegan, Monroe, and some other Michigan
counties, as well as Ohio, Indiana and Ontario, Canada, the Kalamazoo
Gazette reported on Thursday [27 Jul 2006]. But researchers say its
presence could be more widespread.
Michigan produces nearly a third of the nation's crop of pickling
cucumbers, which are processed into everything from kosher dills to sweet
relish, the newspaper said.
"If you get it, it's a disaster," said Michael Hescott, president of
Freestone Pickle Co. in Bangor. Without adequate prevention, "in 6 or 7
days, a field will be laid over dead. It looks like it's been hit by a hard
frost."
The emergence of downy mildew is the latest in a string of problems for
Michigan farmers. Thunderstorms this month [July 2006] damaged some of the
state's fruit crops on the heels of a frost this spring [2006] that also
caused damage.
Mary Hausbeck, a plant pathologist at Michigan State University, has
developed protocols for protecting Michigan's crops. Her lab confirmed the
1st reports of downy mildew this year [2006] from fields of cucumbers in
Monroe County. "It is my opinion that Monroe County was ground zero for the
epidemic we are now seeing in the state," she said.
Cucumber growers have been advised to start spraying weekly with a
fungicide to combat downy mildew.

[2] Downy mildew on cucumber - Canada (Ontario)

Southwestern Ontario's cucumber crop is being devastated by an airborne
disease from the southern United States. It's the 1st time the disease,
known as downy mildew, has moved north of the border.
"The disease is killing off healthy crops in less than 3 days," Don
VanRoboys, who operates a Bick's Pickle grading station east of Chatham,
said yesterday [27 Jul 2006]. VanRoboys, who has been in the cucumber
business for more than 40 years, said the disease turns a perfectly healthy
cucumber field a brown color in a few days. The 2 Canadian-registered
sprays for use against the disease are having little or no effect,
VanRoboys said. He doubts that a quarter of this year's [2006] CND 5
million [around USD 4.5 million] crop in Chatham-Kent will make it to market.
"We're just into the 1st week of harvest, and many growers have already
plowed under their crops," he said. "Many crops are a total write-off.
There are as many as 1000 Mennonites in Chatham-Kent who rely on the crop
to put food on the table. These people are suddenly finding themselves out
of work."
Entire Mennonite families contract with growers to hand-pick the crop.
Wallaceburg-area farmer Mike Denys described the cucumber crop as a
"disaster," adding there appears to be a small pocket in the Wallaceburg
area untouched by the disease. "But everywhere else, the crop has been hit
hard."
There are reports the disease was blown northward by one of the many
hurricanes that struck the southern US last fall [2005], Denys said.

[The crop plant cucumber, _Cucumis sativus_, develops symptoms of the
disease downy mildew when infected by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_.
Downy mildew of cucurbits is found annually on squash, cucumbers, pumpkins,
muskmelons, and watermelons. Although downy mildew of all cucurbits is
thought to be caused by the same species, strains of _P. cubensis_ exist.
For example, it is not uncommon to see squash, cantaloupe, and cucumber
severely diseased by downy mildew, whereas watermelons nearby show no signs
of this disease. Downy mildew is a foliar pathogen characterized by angular
yellow blotches and by a downy gray to purple mildew on the underside of
leaves under damp conditions.
Infection can reduce yield, fruit quality, and harvesting time. Downy
mildew can kill plants if plants are severely infected early. Management of
the disease involves use of resistant cultivars and fungicides.
Disease spreads from south to north via wind borne sporangia on an annual
basis in North America and is of sufficient concern to justify an annual
forecasting service managed by North Carolina State University (see
"Links"). These 2 articles indicate spread as far north as Michigan, USA
and Ontario, in southern Canada by July 2006, and this northern activity
for this disease appears to be unusual, from the tone of both articles. The
North American Plant Disease Forecast Center update for late June 2006
mentions an earlier report in Brant County, southern Ontario, so the claims
for "1st" in the Canadian article may not be correct. The progression of
disease in North America in 2006 can be found in the 3rd link in the
"Links" section below.
