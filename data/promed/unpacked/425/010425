1st report of brown spot of tangerine hybrid cultivars Minneola, Page and

15 Nov 2005.
A new disease of the tangerine hybrid cultivars Minneola (_Citrus
tangerina_ cv. Dancy x C. paradisi cv. Duncan), Page (Minneola x _C.
clementina_), and Fortune (_C. tangerina_ x _C. clementina_) was observed
in the Mazandaran province of Iran in the summer of 2002. Brown necrotic
lesions surrounded by yellow haloes, characteristic of alternaria brown
spot of citrus, were found on young leaves and fruit.
Infected young fruit and leaves abscised prematurely and mature fruit was
unmarketable due to light brown, circular, depressed lesions on its
surface. A fungus was isolated from the infected leaves, fruit and twigs
and was identified as _Alternaria alternata_ based on the morphological
characteristics of the conidia. Pathogenicity tests were conducted by
inoculating 10 detached, immature leaves of the varieties Minneola and Page
with droplets of conidial suspensions (100 000 conidia per ml) and
incubating them in a moist chamber at 25 deg C. Necrotic spots with
characteristic yellow haloes developed on the leaves after 3 days.
Re-isolation of the same fungus from diseased tissue of both inoculated
cultivars fulfilled Koch's postulates.
DNA was extracted from 5 isolates and a partial endopolygalacturonase gene
was PCR-amplified and sequenced for each (Peever et al., 2002, 2004).
Sequences of all 5 isolates were identical and in BLAST searches of the
NCBI database, the closest matches were _A. alternata_ accessions
AY295023.1 (isolate EGS 44-160), AY295021.1 (isolate BC2-RLR-1s) and
AY295022.1 (isolate EGS44-159) with 99.8, 99.8 and 99.6 percent sequence
similarity respectively. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that isolates from
all 3 hosts clustered in Clade 3, together with brown spot isolates from
Israel, Turkey, South Africa and Australia (Peever et al., 2002). These
results, in conjunction with the morphological characterisation and
pathogenicity tests, confirm the identity of the fungus as _Alternaria
alternata_.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of Alternaria brown spot of citrus
in Iran.

[Alternaria brown spot (ABS) is known to occur in South Africa, Turkey,
Israel, Spain, and Colombia as well as Florida and possibly in other
citrus-growing regions. The disease first appeared in Florida citrus groves
about 30 years ago and has become a serious problem on some varieties in
recent years. It was first reported in Australia in 1962, but it is not
known when the fungus arrived in Florida. It is assumed that the conditions
in Iranian citrus groves are similar to those in Florida.
Fungicides are the primary means of controlling ABS. However, there are
many management practices which are helpful in reducing disease severity.
New groves should be established with disease-free nursery stock. If
_Alternaria_ is present from the outset, it increases to high populations
during the period of vegetative growth on young trees and is difficult to
control on fruit.
For new groves, it is best to locate susceptible varieties in high areas
where air drainage and ventilation are good and leaves can dry more
rapidly. Less vigorous rootstocks such as Cleopatra mandarin should be
selected rather than vigorous ones like Carrizo citrange. Groves of
Minneola tangelos in low, wet areas have conditions so favorable for
disease that ABS may be virtually uncontrollable. Trees of susceptible
varieties should be spaced more widely than oranges to promote rapid drying
of the canopy.
In existing plantings, it is important not to promote excessive vegetative
growth. Overwatering and excessive nitrogen fertilization should be
avoided. Light hedging should be done frequently rather than hedging
severely but less often.
For products registered for control of _Alternaria_ brown spot, see the
Florida Citrus Pest Management Guide. The number of fungicide applications
needed for control varies greatly with the susceptibility of the variety
and the severity of the infestation. In the worst cases, the 1st spray
should be applied when the new shoots are about 4-6 inches long to prevent
buildup of _Alternaria_ on the spring flush. The 2nd application should be
made at petal fall. Thereafter, applications may need to be made as often
as every 10 days to achieve good control on fruit and foliage.
When frequent applications of copper fungicides are being used, rates can
be reduced to as little as one pound of metallic copper per acre. During
dry periods which often occur in April and early May, spray intervals can
be increased. Likewise, less susceptible varieties or less severely
affected groves do not need such intense spray programs. Groves of
susceptible varieties should be monitored frequently to determine the
disease status. Spraying can be discontinued in late June, since fruit
usually become resistant to Alternaria in July as fruit growth slows. It is
probably not economical to try to control the disease on late summer
flushes of growth.
