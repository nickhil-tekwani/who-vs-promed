BSE - GERMANY
=============
[The following was extracted from ANIMAL PHARM No 349, May 24th, 1996. MHJ]
The German ban on imports of Swiss beef and beef products must remain in place
until the BSE problem is cleared, Agriculture Jochen Borchert has stressed.
To date Switzerland has had 211 cases of BSE.
Speaking at a meeting of the German central agriculrural marketing board
(CMA) last month, the minister sought to reassure consumers by stressing that
German beef comes only from animals slaughtered in Germany and veterinarian
checked. However, compared with its European neighbours, the German reaction
to BSE has been out of proportion to its incidence.
To date there have been four cases of BSE reported in Germany. All were
imported breeding stock from the UK and held to have been "infected" prior
to entering Germany. There is no definite proof however of when & how that
"infection" took place, notes Arzte Zeitung. Moreover, all four were of
breeds usually grassfed and reared extensively. Perhaps as few as 200 of
the 160,000 British BSE cases have stemmed from cattle reared in this manner,
believes Dr Gotz Anhalt, a veterinarian with the Agriculture Ministry of
Lower Saxony.
The four cattle were sold at about two years old to German cattle traders.
It is assumed that they were fed up prior to export to enhance weight gain
and make them more attractive to dealers. Their ages ... three were born
in 1988 and one in 1986 ... would indicate trhat that any such feeding with
MBM would have occurred after the UK's July 1988 ban on mammalian feed,
thus illegally. [Some carryover of feed and other practices have clearly
occurred however. MHJ] Arzte Zeitung has thus speculated on the possibilty
that they became infected within Germany.
The animals were sold via cattle traders in Lower Saxony and elsewhere. There
is a dispute for at least one as to the herd of origin. A veterinarian
claimed that for the index case in February 1992, UK documentation showed
clearly that the animal came from a herd that until then had been BSE-free.
Another veterinarian also involved in the diagnosis claims that the precise
origin was far from clear and possibly via "dubious channels".
The issue of BSE and its effects in Germany have incensed the national
farmers' union (DBV) whose president has lambasted the UK for its
"scandalous negligence" in past BSE control efforts. He asserts that German
farmers are innocent victims and have suffered a very severe backlash ...
surveys show that German beef consumption is lagging at under half pre-crisis
levels. [In France beef consumption has been at 30% of normal. MHJ] The DBV
is adamant that mammalian feed has never been fed to German cattle and that
"Germany is BSE free".
