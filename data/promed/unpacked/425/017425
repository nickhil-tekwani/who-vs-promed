At least 2 wild birds in Virginia have been recently confirmed to have avian influenza, a virus that is very contagious among birds.

This comes after the virus was detected in North Carolina and South Carolina. The Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources said, "These detections were not unexpected."

According to the CDC, the virus can make the birds sick or result in death, but most birds infected do not end up getting sick. The risk to the public is low, and people should be mindful that they properly prepare and handle meat and eggs.

Avian influenza can negatively impact poultry, which can harm backyard farmers and commercial productions. The department of wildlife said people who are farming poultry should review their biosecurity efforts to keep their birds separate from possibly infected wild birds.

If your birds become ill, you can report it to the State Veterinarian's Office at (804) 692-0601 or at <vastatevet@vdacs.virginia.gov>.

[New reports show that Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses are spreading in North America. From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways breed in Arctic tundra regions, providing opportunities for HPAI viruses to be introduced into another continent. Thus, migration of those species could have been the cause of the introduction of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 into the Americas. - Mod.PMB
