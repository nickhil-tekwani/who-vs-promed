An outbreak of the deadly [infection due to the bacterium] _Listeria_ has been confirmed in Mallorca.

A patient is recovering in a private clinic in Palma as samples of the bacterium are being tested in Madrid to confirm if it is the same strain as the recent outbreak in Andalucia. It seems likely to have originated from the same lethal strain since the patient affected [in Mallorca] had come from Granada.

So far 3 people have died and 7 women have aborted babies out of the 200 people confirmed to have been affected.

The dangerous bacterium spreads through food and can cause severe illnesses including sepsis, meningitis and other life-long problems.

[_Listeria_ have been identified in 3 meat products and in needles used to inject lard into the meat before it is cooked at a meat processing facility in Seville implicated in this outbreak (after cooking, the meat is usually served cold and in thin slices). Proper cooking of the meat at the processing facility should have killed _Listeria_, which suggests either that the meat, may have been improperly cooked or that contamination may have occurred after cooking. The prior news report said that _Listeria_ was isolated from an oven cart used at the processing facility in Seville; if the meat was placed on this cart after cooking, it could explain how the meat became contaminated despite having been previously cooked. The meat processing facility has been closed, and all its products have now been recalled, but because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop, more cases can be expected.

Genotyping clinical isolates of _L. monocytogenes_ will help identify clusters of cases that have a common source, and genotyping the isolates from the food and environmental surfaces at the meat processing facility will help confirm the source, if genotypes match. We await further developments in the investigation of this outbreak.

Palma, with a population of 409 661 residents, the capital and resort city of the autonomous community of the Balearic Islands in Spain, is located on the south coast of Mallorca (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_de_Mallorca). Mallorca is the largest island in the Balearic Islands, located approximately 300 km [186 mi] off the eastern coast of Spain in the western Mediterranean (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallorca). The autonomous community of Andalucia is located in southern Spain, with the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the east (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville).
