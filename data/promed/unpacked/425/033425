Mystery disease affects 100 at Bangladesh school
-----------------------------
More than 100 students and teachers from a school in Bangladesh have
been admitted to hospital after suffering convulsions, police said on
Saturday [14 Jul 2007]. The cause of their sudden illness was being
investigated.
The victims fell ill at Adiabad School and College near Narshingdi
district town, 55 km (34 miles) northeast of the capital Dhaka, a
police inspector said.
A total of 23 people died in Bangladesh in 2004 from a mysterious
disease later diagnosed as an encephalitis, or inflammation of the
brain caused by a viral infection. Dozens more were infected with the
disease, which some had feared was bird flu.
Bird flu in Bangladesh since March this year [2007] has forced
authorities to cull nearly 255 000 chickens and destroy more than 2.2
million eggs.
Authorities said there was no case of human infection.

[The above newswire seems to suggest there was an almost simultaneous
sudden onset of seizures in more than 100 students and teachers. The
actual time frame of this incident is not provided, nor is additional
information provided. If this was a relatively sudden onset of
symptoms one would suspect a common source exposure with a relatively
short "incubation period" (time between exposure and onset of
symptoms). The 2 most likely explanations would be either a toxic
exposure to a substance that is associated with sudden neurologic
symptoms: possibly aerosolized or possibly ingested in a common food
exposure, or, as much as it pains this moderator to entertain this
diagnosis, a sudden hysteria-like response on the part of a student
body after some common noxious exposure that may have lead to
symptoms in one or more students.
The newswire mentions the an outbreak of a mysterious encephalitis
that was most likely one of the several outbreaks of henipavirus
infection reported from Bangladesh. It is highly unlikely that a
sudden onset of seizures in more than 100 individuals in a school
setting would be a manifestation of henipavirus activity in the area.
The newswire also mentions the ongoing avian influenza outbreaks in
poultry in Bangladesh. Likewise it is highly unlikely that an
outbreak of seizures involving 100 individuals would be related to
the ongoing avian influenza activity in the veterinary sector. Hence,
this moderator concludes that the inclusion of those background
events in this newswire would fall under the definition of gratuitous
conclusions that add spice to a newswire report.
More information on this event from knowledgeable sources would be
very much appreciated.
