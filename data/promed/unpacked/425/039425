I am a pediatric infection specialist in Taitung, southeastern side of
Taiwan. The epidemic of enterovirus infection is not so severe in my area.
I saw a lot of patients with hand-foot-mouth disease and herpangina since
April. Most infected children were under 3 years old with uncomplicated
course, but we had only 3 meningoencephalitis cases till now. One of them
was a 19 month-old boy, [who presented with typical hand-foot-mouth
disease, then began vomiting, [and exhibiting lethargy and hypothermia on
the 4th day after vesicles were found. He was admitted to our PICU,
mannitol and IVIG (2g/kg, single dose) were given, and the boy recovered
gradually. [He was finally discharged on the 9th hospital day without any
obvious neurological sequellae. The MRI and EEG were all negative, and the
virus culture from CSF is not available yet. The other two patients all
recovered with only supportive treatment.
How about the IVIG usage experience in other countries (especially in
Malaysia)? And any comment about intrathecal or intraventricular IVIG for
severe enteroviral encephalomyelitis?
