Orlandia, in the Franca region of Sao Paulo state, Brazil, is on alert
because of a suspect case of YF. The Municipal Secretary of Health was to
hand out information leaflets and apply 1500 doses of vaccine on 12 April 2003.

Laboratory results were to be available in a week's time.

A 21-year-old student was hospitalized for a week in the city with a
provisional diagnosis of dengue. However, he progressed to jaundiced skin
& eyes, high fever and body pains. Also a monkey was reported to have died
in the city from YF.
Laboratory results were to be available in a week.

Besides Orlandia, the city of Ribeirao Preto & other townships in the
region are vaccinating, because besides having cases of dengue --
transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ which is also capable of
transmitting YF -- they have also reported dead monkeys.
