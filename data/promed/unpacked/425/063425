Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment
The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection are responding to this event. Testing of the commercial turkey flock occurred after the birds exhibited signs of depression. Samples were submitted for laboratory testing and were confirmed positive for influenza A virus H5N2 LPAI North American wild bird origin. Both the HA and NA are distinct from the EA/AM H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from 2015. The infected premises was quarantined and the turkeys will be depopulated through controlled marketing. A comprehensive epidemiological investigation with enhanced surveillance is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type:
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 4 Mar 2017 / Positive
Birds / virus sequencing / 4 Mar 2017 / Positive
Birds / virus isolation / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material.

"When LPAI findings occur, APHIS and its state partners work to address them quickly and keep the disease from spreading to new flocks. Because LPAI does not typically kill poultry the way that HPAI does, there may be additional control options beyond depopulation. Federal and state officials will determine what option(s) are available to affected producers. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian-influenza-disease/defend-the-flock/defend-the-flock-lpai-info. - Mod.CRD
