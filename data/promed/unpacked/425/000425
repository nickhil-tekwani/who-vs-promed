The 2 outbreaks of legionellosis in the localities of Ripollet and Sabadell (Barcelona) are under control, according to the Catalonia health department, but the number of deaths has risen to 10.

The newspaper 'El Periodico' reports that the National Center for Microbiology identified a vehicle used to clean the city as the source of legionellosis in Ripollet. These are the conclusions presented by the Secretary of Public Health, Antoni Mateu, to the Health Committee of the Catalan Parliament. Mateu explained that of the 7 cases detected in Ripollet, 4 died. In Sabadell, of the 41 cases, 6 died. 5 people are still hospitalized, 28 have been discharged, and 2 others, so far, have not required hospitalization.

[The updated tally for the outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Comarca (county) of Valles Occidental, Catalonia, Spain, according to the news report above, is 48 cases (7 in Ripollet and 41 in Sabadell), including 10 deaths (4 deaths in Ripollet and 6 deaths in Sabadell). The news report in the 1st ProMED-mail post of this outbreak said that 20 of the initial 23 cases lived in the city of Sabadell, 2 in the town of Barbera del Valles, and one in the town of Cerdanyola del Valles (all in the Comarca of Valles Occidental) (Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) fatal 20140919.2788763). A subsequent post added 5 cases, including 3 deaths in the town of Ripollet, a municipality of 29 877 residents in Valles Occidental, which is located between the towns of Barbera del Valles and Cerdanyola del Valles (Legionellosis - Spain (02): (CT) fatal, update, RFI 20140926.2806305).

The proximity of the towns in Valles Occidental raise suspicion that all the cases of legionnaires' disease are linked, but the news report says that the source for the Ripollet cases was a vehicle used in cleaning the city, whereas a cooling tower in Sabadell is the suspected source for all cases other than those that reside in Ripollet (Legionellosis - Spain (03): (CT) fatal, update 20140928.2812770); but we are not told what evidence backs these conclusions. Perhaps genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates was used to establish transmission pathways.

Barbera del Valles is a city of 29 208 people in Valles Occidental, 3 km (1.9 mi) south of Sabadell (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barberà_del_Vallès). Cerdanyola del Valles is a city of 58 747 people, also in Valles Occidental, 4.4 km (2.7 mi) south of Barbera del Valles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerdanyola_del_Vallès).
