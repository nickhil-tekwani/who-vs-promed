Measles cases in Brisbane prompt warning from Queensland Health
---------------------------------------------------------------
Queensland Health is today [7 Feb 2009] warning Brisbane residents to
be on the lookout for the symptoms of measles after 2 young adults
were diagnosed with the highly contagious but now rare disease this
week. The 1st of these is thought to have contracted the disease
interstate and the 2nd in Brisbane. Communicable Diseases Branch
senior medical officer Dr Frank Beard said the concern is that these
infected people may have inadvertently spread the measles virus in
the community before diagnosis. "It is also possible that other
people in Brisbane may have been infected at the same time that the
2nd person acquired their infection and are just becoming unwell now."

The initial symptoms of measles are fever, lethargy, runny nose,
cough, and sore red eyes followed a few days later by a red blotchy
rash. The rash starts on the face and then spreads to the chest and
the rest of the body. Measles is extremely contagious and is spread
through coughing and sneezing. Measles can be complicated by
pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). Complications
are most common and severe in babies and young children, adults, and
people of any age suffering from a chronic illness.

"I would urge people to be particularly aware of any signs of
infection in themselves or their children," he said. "Anyone who
develops a fever, cough, runny nose and eyes, and a blotchy red rash
over the next few weeks should seek advice from their local doctor.
However, it is very important that people ring ahead to the doctor's
surgery to say they could have measles, so that precautions can be
taken to avoid spreading the disease to others." They should then
stay home until their doctor has excluded measles.

Dr Beard said that symptoms usually started around 10 to 14 days
after contact with an infected person. "Population health officers
have been identifying individuals who may have been exposed to the 2
cases. To prevent measles infection, those contacts identified who
are not vaccinated have been offered either measles vaccine or an
injection of immunoglobulin.

"Queensland Health will continue to follow up people who may have
been exposed and undertake steps to prevent further spread," he said.
Two doses of a measles-containing vaccine (MMR -- measles, mumps,
rubella) are strongly recommended to prevent the disease. The 1st
dose is currently recommended at 12 months of age and the 2nd at 4
years of age. "Immunisation is the best protection against measles,
so parents should ensure that their children are vaccinated on time,"
Dr Beard said. "Adults born after 1965 should also be vaccinated,
unless their records show that they have had 2 doses of measles
vaccine in the past."
