India begins culling chickens in bird flu-hit Tripura
-----------------------------------------------------
India began culling thousands of chickens on Tuesday [8 Apr 2008] and
checking people for fever in remote northeastern villages on the
border with Bangladesh after tests on dead poultry confirmed bird flu
infections.

Around 100 health workers wearing protective suits and masks began
collecting chickens and ducks from 8 villages in Dhalai district in
Tripura state, where 3000 birds died in the past week.

"The state government is fully prepared to tackle the situation.
There is no [shortage] of medicines or trained veterinary and medical
staff in the affected area," said Aghore Debbarma, Tripura's Animal
Resources Development Department minister.

He said at least 21 rapid-action teams were formed to carry out
culling of around 20 000 birds in the affected area to prevent
further spread of the H5N1 avian flu virus.

Tripura borders Bangladesh, where more than half the country's
districts have been affected by the virus. In India, the virus
surfaced in West Bengal earlier this year [2008] and appeared to have
been contained by culling nearly 4 million birds. But the virus has
intermittently flared up.

India's egg trade suffered losses of millions of rupees following the
outbreak of bird flu after Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and other countries
banned egg imports.

Chicken sales have been largely affected in only those areas where
the flu occurred, but there has been little national impact on demand.

India, home to tens of millions of farmers who keep poultry in their
yards, has seen 3 major outbreaks of bird flu in poultry since 2006,
all of which were brought under control.

No human cases have been reported in India.

[India's last (no. 2) follow-up report on the epizootic, which
started 4 Jan 2008, was submitted to the OIE (World Organisation for
Animal Health) on 28 Mar 2008 (see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6924>).
The current outbreak, though still within the regions bordering
Bangladesh, represents a significant extension of the infected areas.

Additional, official epidemiological and disease-control data are
expected in the due follow-up report.

South Korea confirms new bird flu outbreak
------------------------------------------
South Korea on Monday [7 Apr 2008] confirmed a new outbreak of bird
flu at a duck farm in the southwest and said it was investigating 2
other possible cases days after reporting an outbreak at a nearby chicken farm.

Quarantine workers had started culling 6500 ducks at the Jeongeup
farm, where 6000 poultry have died since last week, and had destroyed
thousands of birds which had already been sent elsewhere, the Farm
Ministry said.

They were also investigating 2 nearby duck farms where hundreds of
birds had died over the weekend [5-6 Apr 2008]. [According to a
report in the Korea Times, those farms are located at Gimje and
Sunchang (North Jeolla province)
<http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2008/04/113_22081.html>. - Mod.AS]

The area is only 27 km (17 mi) from the chicken farm in Gimje, about
215 km (134 mi) south of Seoul, which reported the country's 1st
outbreak of H5N1 in 13 months.

The farm ministry banned distribution of 3.6 million birds within a
10 km (6.2 mi) radius of the Gimje site and the destruction of eggs
distributed from the area.

South Korea had 7 outbreaks of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu
between November 2006 and March 2007 and has spent 58 billion won
(USD 59.5 million) on quarantine measures.

Virulent bird flu strain confirmed in Jeongeup
----------------------------------------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza is confirmed to have broken out in
the southwestern city of Jeongeup, the 2nd after one on a chicken
farm in Gimje, North Jeolla Province.

The Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry announced
Monday [7 Apr 2008] that the H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus killed
ducks on a farm in the town of Yeongwon near Jeongeup as reported
Thursday [3 Apr 2008].

The number of poultry farms with or suspected of having bird flu has
increased to 4 after the 1st outbreak was confirmed in a chicken farm
in the town of Yeongji last week.

Quarantine authorities of North Jeolla Province examined a duck farm
in the town of Gobu, where 700 of the birds died Saturday [5 Apr
2008]. They suspect the possibility of a H5N1 outbreak.

The farm is only 4.5 km (3 mi) away from where the virus was first
detected. Bird flu symptoms such as bleeding in the kidney were found
among ducks in the 1st autopsy.

Health authorities prohibited 18 000 ducks from the Gobu farm from
being carried out and are considering culling them.

Fine Korea, a duck butchery in Naju, South Jeolla Province, has
culled 6520 ducks from Yeongwon. The company has been ordered to bury
30 000 out of 90 000 slaughtered over the past 2 to 5 days, including
the ducks it culled. 60 000 of the dead ducks are being collected as
they are already on the market. Kim Chang-seop, the ministry's
director for animal disease prevention, said, "Though ducks on the
market are not directly related to avian influenza, we are collecting
them because they might have been contaminated by the butchery
machine. Even if they were contaminated, their meat is safe."

[South Korea's immediate notification on the 1st focus of this
developing HPAI epizootic was submitted to the OIE on Wed 2 Apr 2008;
the report mentioned the identity of the involved serotype as
"pending". Today's (8 Apr 2008) confirmation of H5N1 and details of
the additional foci, including duck plants, are expected to be
described in the due follow-up report. - Mod.AS]
