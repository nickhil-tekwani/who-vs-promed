Egyptian boy confirmed with bird flu, 47th case
-----------------------------------------------
An 8-year-old boy in Fayoum province has contracted the bird flu
virus after coming into contact with infected birds -- the 47th case
among humans in Egypt since 2006, the Health Ministry said on
Saturday [8 Mar 2008]. The boy was taken to a local hospital with a
high temperature, difficulty breathing and a pulmonary inflammation,
spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahine said in a statement. He moved to a
Cairo hospital on Friday [7 Mar 2008] and is being treated with
Tamiflu, the standard treatment for humans, it said.

An Egyptian woman from the same province southwest of Cairo died of
the disease last week but a health official said there did not appear
to have been contact between them. Altogether 20 people have died of
bird flu in Egypt since it arrived in the country in February 2006.
It is the 3rd winter the virus has struck after lying low during
Egypt's hot summers.

Around 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income, and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated despite a large-scale poultry
vaccination programme. Deaths from bird flu total more than 230
worldwide since 2003 and have been reported in several African and
Asian countries. Egypt has been the worst-hit country outside of Asia.
