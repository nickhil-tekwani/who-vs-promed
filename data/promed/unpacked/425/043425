Researchers at Oregon State University [OSU] have discovered that many of the viruses that have plagued the cherry growers in Washington [see ProMED-mail post 20140127.2233739] have moved to Oregon: viruses like cherry leaf roll virus, tomato ringspot, tobacco ringspot and little cherry disease.

OSU's Jay Pscheidt said it's important for growers to not ignore problems, look for symptoms and work with labs that can test for these diseases. "Our next step is to find out how prevalent they are." Removal of viruses that you don't know are there is obviously quite difficult.

[Around 30 viruses have been found to affect sweet (_Prunus avium_) and/or sour (_P. cerasus_) cherry trees, singly or in coinfections. Many of them also affect other _Prunus_ species.

Of the viruses mentioned above, _Cherry leafroll virus (CLRV), _Tomato ringspot virus_ (ToRSV) and _Tobacco ringspot virus_ (TRSV) all belong to genus _Nepovirus_. On cherry, CLRV and TRSV mainly cause leaf symptoms as indicated by their names, ToRSV has also been associated with stem pitting. Generally, members of the genus are transmitted by nematodes, but most can also be transmitted by mechanical means, with infected planting and grafting material and to varying degrees by seed and pollen.

Little cherry disease (LCD) is a serious problem for sweet and sour cherry producers in parts of northern Europe and North America. It can be caused by 2 closteroviruses, _Little cherry virus 1_ (LChV-1, not yet assigned to a genus) and LChV-2 (genus _Ampelovirus_), in single or mixed infections. Symptoms vary with host cultivars, but may include reduced size and quality of fruit, premature leaf reddening, stunting of seedlings and some loss of tree vigour. All commercial cherry cultivars are susceptible, and ornamental flowering cherries can be asymptomatic reservoirs of LChV-1. LChV-2 is transmitted by mealybug vectors which can be spread by wind and with packing material. An insect vector for LChV-1 is not known. Both viruses can be spread by both shoot and root grafting and with infected plant material.

Disease management for fruit tree viruses may include phytosanitation in orchards, use of certified clean planting stock and budwood, elimination of inoculum (removal of infected trees) and vector control if feasible.
