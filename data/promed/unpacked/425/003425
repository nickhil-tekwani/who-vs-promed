Effective distribution of clean water is finally underway in the town
of Nokia, where thousands have been sickened by bacteria-infested tap
water since last weekend. On Thursday [6 Dec 2007], members of the
Finnish Defence Forces and volunteers handed out bottles of water
door to door from 7 am to 10 pm. Meanwhile, 18 water distribution
points are operating around Nokia.

Meanwhile, the number of people being treated for gastrointestinal
illnesses has declined. As of Thursday morning [6 Dec 2007], there
were about 10 patients on intravenous drips at Tampere University
Hospital. So far this week, the hospital has treated scores of
patients from Nokia, including more than 50 children.

At Nokia's own health center, water-borne illnesses have spread among
patients and between patients and staff. Employees from the
neighboring town of Hameenkyro have been helping out.

A total ban on using tap water in most of Nokia remains in effect
following a main water pipe break late Tuesday [4 Dec 2007], which
worsened an already difficult situation. Repairs on the pipe were
completed on the next day.

A city of 30 000 some 20 km from Tampere, Nokia is best known for the
mobile phone company that got its start there.

[With repair of the problem, as expected, this seemingly large
cluster of gastrointestinal infection is subsiding. Nokia is in the
province of Western Finland, which can be found on a map at
