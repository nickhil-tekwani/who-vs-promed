I am writing to provide an additional perspective regarding the cutaneous
leishmaniasis article recently published in the International Journal for
Parasitology, which was described in Promed Volume 2004: 178. The editor of
the Promed article presumed that the finding of a Leishmania species
parasite in Australia indicated that the organism had been recently
imported. Although recent importation of the parasite is possible, it is
equally possible that the parasite has been endemic, yet undetected.
Additional work is currently being conducted to characterize the phylogeny
of the organism.

In response to the request for additional information regarding the host of
the infection, the species affected were red kangaroos (_Macropus rufus_).
Red kangaroos are an arid zone species and could be described as maladapted
to the wet tropical region of the Darwin area.

[Many thanks to Karrie Rose. It is a fact of life that the greater majority
of "new reports" are a bit late in arriving. To quote Sherlock, as ever
lecturing Watson, "My dear Watson, you see, but you do not observe." The
Australian northern regions are not like Regents Park -- they are sparsely
populated. Much could be out there that is still to be described. Like
Karrie, I would not be surprised if the red kangaroo has merely acted as a
marsupial canary. - Mod.MHJ]

[Karrie Rose may be right. In the International Journal for Parasitology it
is stated that "Despite a clear indication that the parasites belong to the
genus _leishmania_, no assignation to a known _leishmania_ species could be
made using these or other less conserved genetic loci such as the
non-transcribed spacer of the mini-exon repeat". The inability to link the
isolated parasite with other _leishmania_ parasites indicate that the
isolated parasites did not originate from outside Australia. - Mod.EP]
