There has been a rise in the number of malaria cases, including _P.
falciparum_ cases, in the state. In just 2 weeks, various district
health centres in the state recorded as many as 8228 confirmed malaria
cases, while the number of _P. falciparum_ cases stood at 2625.

Surat and Ahmedabad topped the chart. The high mosquito density in
these cities is proving to be a problem for officials. In just 2
weeks, both these cities recorded the highest number of malaria cases
with Surat recording as many as 1274 cases closely followed by
Ahmedabad with 1020 cases. The tribal district of Dahod has now
emerged as another troubled zone with 829 malaria cases recorded in
the past 2 weeks.

The overall fever cases in the state rose from 33 460 to 38 828,
indicating the changing weather pattern in the state. "Fever cases are
not being given a go by. In cities and in district hospitals we have
been maintaining a constant vigil over these cases," says a senior
health official.

[Gujarat State is endemic for malaria including _P. falciparum_. A
report from the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEA-MAL-256;
http://203.90.70.117/catalogue/2006-2010/pdf/malaria/sea-mal-256.pdf)
state that "Retrospective analysis of reported cases and deaths in
Ahmedabad, Gujarat State revealed a mean incidence of 12.2 cases per
1000 [population] which was 9 times greater than that officially
reported (1.3 cases per 1000 annually). In the same study, annual
malaria-attributable mortality detected was 22 deaths per million
which was far greater than the far greater than the officially
reported (0.3 deaths per million) (Yadav et al. The burden of malaria
in Ahmedabad city, India: a retrospective analysis of reported cases
and deaths. Ann Trop Med Parasitol. 2003 Dec;97(8):793-802;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14754491). This analysis indicate
that the number of cases are about 10 times higher than the number of
reported cases. Thus the number of cases reported by Times of India
does not necessarily means a surge but may just indicate a interest in
reporting the cases.
