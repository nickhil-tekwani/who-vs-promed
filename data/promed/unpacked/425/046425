I would like to offer a few corrections to the version of the facts that
made it into the press concerning Leishmaniasis in foxhounds in
Virginia.
First, the number of registered foxhounds nationwide is about 14 000,
not 4000. Virtually all of these have been tested once using the CDC's
IFA [immunofluorescence assay protocol. Virginia has more
registered foxhound packs (30) than any other state, and about 45
percent of those packs had at least one hound with an IFA titer of
greater than or equal to 1:64 [positive and/or the organism was
cultured from at least one hound in the pack. There are other states and
provinces with fewer registered packs that have equal or higher
incidences. At least one seropositive dog was detected in 69 different
kennels of foxhounds in 21 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces.
All culture isolates, from multiple states, have been typed at the world
reference lab in Rome as _L. infantum_, MON1, a strain endemic in
the Mediterranean area. The distribution and competence of potential
sandfly vectors is unknown, and there are no published studies on
attempted direct transmission of the US isolates.
The moderator correctly pointed out that the unique ecology of these
foxhound packs is more similar to that of a herd than we are used to
thinking of for dogs. The packs are usually divided by sex to prevent
unintentional breeding. There is plenty of minor fighting within packs
as the "pecking order" is established and shifts, resulting in superficial
lacerations; cuts are also picked up during hunting. There is also a
great deal of movement of hounds going to shows and hunts as well as
being "drafted" or loaned to another pack for breeding etc. Another
possible contributing factor may be a genetic pre-disposition in this
foxhound breed towards a deficient immune system, as has been
documented in humans and mice.
