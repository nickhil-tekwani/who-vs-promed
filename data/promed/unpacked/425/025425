A 16-year-old girl at risk of death admitted to the Las Condes clinic
remains in the intensive care unit. The youth was infected by a
hantavirus while participating in a scout camp in the Conguillio
National Park, in the Araucania region.

The student is connected to a blood purification [oxygenation]
system, called Emoc, since her lungs are not functioning due to the
severe infection. "The machine acts as a lung, taking blood from
veins, passing it through a membrane for gas exchange, and returns it
to the circulatory system oxygenated. Without this machine, she would
have died,'" indicated Guillermo Acuna, chief of infectious diseases
of the Las Condes clinic, where the youth has been for 3 weeks.

The girl began to suffer a strong headache and fever, symptoms for
which her family decided to take her to the medical center where,
according to tests performed, it was thought that it could be
meningitis. However, despite treatment, the symptoms did not cease,
and so she underwent a series of [additional] examinations, among
them a lung x-ray in which the infection was detected, the 4th
recorded in the country this year [2009].

This student of the Alianza Francesa, attended the scout camp between
15-30 Jan [2009] with other people. The chief of the Epidemiology
Department of the Ministry of Health, Claudia Espinoza, called on all
those who participated in the activity to contact health authorities
in order to discard the disease in others.

[Although this article does not specify which hantavirus is involved
in this case, it is probably Andes virus. Isolation of hantaviruses,
detection of specific hantavirus genomic sequences by PCR, and
serology to detect Andes virus IgM or IgG requires a fairly
sophisticated virology laboratory.

<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=3899463&v=-32.5,-72,5>.
The Conguillio National Park is located 148 km (92.5 mi) northeast of
Temuco, in the Andes mountains that form the mountainous spine that
runs the length of Chile. A map of the park can be accessed at
<http://www.gochile.cl/eng/Guide/ChileNationalParks/Conguillio/Conguillio-M.asp>.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/noframes/hpsslideset/hpsslides1-12.htm>.

An image of the long-tailed pigmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus,
