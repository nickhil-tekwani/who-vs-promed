ABSTRACT
A molecular survey of 16 057 mosquitoes captured in southwest Germany
during the summer of 2009 demonstrated the presence of Sindbis virus
(SINV) in _Culex_ spp. and _Anopheles maculipennis_ sensu lato.
Phylogenetic analysis of the German SINV strains linked them with
Swedish SINV strains, the causative agent of Ockelbo disease in
humans.

INTRODUCTION
Sindbis virus (SINV), the prototype virus of the genus _Alphavirus_
within the family _Togaviridae_, is an arthropod-borne (arbo),
single-stranded RNA virus and the most widely distributed of all
known arboviruses (16). SINV was 1st isolated from a pool of 63
_Culex pipiens_ and _Culex univittatus_ mosquitoes collected in the
Sindbis health district, near Cairo, in 1952 (15) and was further
demonstrated to be the causative agent of a febrile illness
associated with maculopapular rash and joint pain in humans in
Africa, Eurasia (Ockelbo disease, Pogosta disease, and Karelian
fever), and Australia (8, 9, 13). In Europe, the vectors are
ornithophilic mosquitoes of the species _Culex torrentium_, _C.
pipiens_, and _Culiseta morsitans_, as well as _Ochlerotatus_ spp.
and _Aedes_ spp. (5). Birds of the orders _Passeriformes_ and
_Anseriformes_ are counted among the main hosts of the virus and have
been shown to be responsible for the geographic distribution of SINV
and the possible introduction of SINV to so far un-infested areas
(5). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence data of several
SINV strains demonstrated 2 distinct genetic lineages
(paleoarctic/Ethiopian and oriental/Australian) (7, 14). It was not
known if SINV circulates in Germany, and therefore, the natural
vectors of SINV and the geographic distribution of SINV in its
vectors have remained unknown as well.

RESULTS
Overall, 643 pools were assayed (cell culture and real-time RT-PCR)
for the presence of SINV. Ten SINV RNA-positive pools, all
originating from Weinheim, were detected by real-time RT-PCR. Eight
pools included mosquitoes of the species _Cx. torrentium_ , one
included mosquitoes of the species _Cx. pipiens_, and another one
included mosquitoes of the species complex _Anopheles maculipennis_
sensu lato. Maximum likelihood estimates of mosquito infection rates
were calculated using the software program PooledInfRate, version 3.0
and revealed that the highest infection rate (4.9) in the _Culex_
mosquitoes trapped in Weinheim was in the beginning of July. Three of
643 pools caused virus-like CPE in Vero cells after 48 hours. All 3
pools previously tested positive for SINV-specific RNA by real-time
RT-PCR, and SINV-specific RNA was also detected by real-time RT-PCR.
The overall nucleotide identities between the German SINV strains and
the Swedish SINV strains were 99.4 to 99.6 percent. Phylogenetic
analysis by Bayesian inference revealed a close relationship of the
newly described SINV strains from Germany with the SINV strains
(Ockelbo-Edsbyn and 95M116) circulating in Sweden.

CONCLUSION
The 1st molecular survey of SINV in Germany demonstrated the presence
of SINV in 3 different mosquito species (_Cx. torrentium_, _Cx.
pipiens_, and _An. maculipennis_ sensu lato). The ornithophilic _C.
torrentium_ and _C. pipiens_ mosquitoes are the principal vectors for
SINV in Sweden and are responsible for hundreds of human SINV
infections in Fennoscandia. In contrast, the zoophilic _An.
maculipennis_ sensu lato was previously not identified as a vector
for SINV. In line with the results of a previous study, it was
demonstrated that the floodwater mosquito _Ae. vexans_ is not a
vector for SINV in Germany. The close phylogenetic relationship of
German SINV strains with Swedish SINV strains suggests that migratory
birds serve as a host for the virus, allowing the dissemination of
SINV over large areas within a short period of time. Future studies
will investigate the risk of human SINV infections in Germany in
areas with high SINV infection rates in mosquitoes.

[This report provides convincing but not surprising evidence for the
presence of Sindbis virus in mosquitoes in Germany, apparently in the
absence of detected disease in animals or humans at the time the
mosquitoes were collected. - Mod.TY]

[One more emerging zoonosis in need of concerted, interdisciplinary
epidemiological studies and coordinated control efforts, incorporating the
relevant international organizations. This indeed has been the theme of last
week's (27-29 April 2010) second "FAO/OIE/WHO scientific consultation on
influenza and other emerging zoonotic diseases at the human-animal
interface", held in Verona, Italy with the participation of some 70
scientists from 5 continents. Veterinarians, physicians, virologists,
entomologists, ecologists and wildlife experts discussed and brainstormed
the technical basis for developing or modifying policies and strategies to
more effectively prepare for and respond to the next emerging event. Among
the diseases handled - WNV, RVF, CCHF, Nipah & Hendra, Ebola & Marburg
viruses, Hantavirus, HIV/SIV, SARS, H5N1, H1N1.... The publication of the
conclusions and recommendations is expected soon. - Mod.AS].
