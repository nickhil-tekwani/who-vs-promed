Quarantine in Busse, Amur region to be lifted in July
-----------------------------------------------------
According to sources at the Amur regional administration, the quarantine in
Busse imposed last week due to an outbreak of the FMD virus, [strain] Asia
1, which is new to Russia, will be lifted on 11 Jul 2005. This follows
complete cleansing and disinfection by mechanical and chemical means of the
affected premises, as well as the disinfection of clothing, utensils,
vehicles, and adjoining premises. The effectiveness of the said measures is
to be tested by laboratory studies.
3 months after the removal of the quarantine measures on 11 Jul 2005, the
repopulation of the affected farms -- with animals vaccinated against FMD
serotype Asia 1 -- will be allowed.
The Amur regional administration is engaged in estimating the economic
losses caused by the outbreak for purposes of compensation.
Roadblocks, manned by military, have been operational to implement the
current ban upon movement of animals into and out of the quarantined zone
and of export of animal products (derived from large and small ruminants
and from pigs), including milk [that has] not undergone heat treatment.
Vaccinations of all susceptible animals are being carried out within the
region in all commercial enterprises as well as smallholdings.

[From the above newswire, it appears that the Russian veterinary
authorities have implemented rigorous and thorough measures to eradicate
the disease. It remains to hope that return to normality and repopulation
of the affected premises will indeed be possible according to the planned
timetable. This depends mainly on the absence of repeated transboundary
introductions and on the validity of the assumption that no spread from the
index farm had taken place prior to its detection and eradication.
The risk of possible repeated introductions of the virus from China is not
negligible. The virus is most probably endemic there, as reflected by the
fact that 2 outbreaks have been recorded almost simultaneously in 2 very
distant areas, one on the eastern coast and one in north western China. In
addition, the Asia 1 virus has been identified in 8 samples received during
March 2005 at the FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, UK
from cattle in the territory of Hong Kong; see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/Aphthovirus/WRLFMD/2005/FMD2005-03.pdf>.
The antigenic characterisation of the virus expected to ba carried out by
the WRL is essential for vaccine recommendations to protect the region and
beyond. - Mod.AS]
