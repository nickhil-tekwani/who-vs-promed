The number of people suffering from [typhoid fever] is on the rise in the district [Saptari], with the rise in temperature and rainfall. The Gajendra Narayan Singh Hospital in Rajbiraj has been receiving an increasing number of people coming with complaints of viral fever and typhoid, according to Ram Kumar Diyali of the Emergency Ward of the hospital. Every day more than 40 persons suffering from typhoid and viral fever are coming to the hospital, compared to 3 to 4 persons 2 weeks ago, Diyali said.

Quick change in weather and failure to observe alertness in food habits have increased the spread of viral fever and typhoid, doctors said. "We are now suffering lack of beds as the hospital is receiving such patients from Siraha [and] Udayapur districts as well, including from neighboring village in India," said Medical Superintendent Dr Saileksh Jha.

[Typhoid fever is caused by _Salmonella enterica_ subtype Typhi, _Salmonella enterica_ Paratyphi A, or _Salmonella enterica_ Paratyphi B. Humans are the only reservoir for typhi, whereas paratyphi A and B also have animal reservoirs. These organisms are transmitted by either an intestinal carrier or someone ill with typhoid fever, or by a non-human animal reservoir in the case of paratyphi A or B, usually by means of fecal contamination of food or water.

Typhoid fever is endemic in Nepal: cases of typhi infection peak in July and August, the months with highest annual precipitation, whereas cases of paratyphi A, which has become an increasingly important cause of typhoid fever in Nepal, occur equally throughout the year, possibly reflecting different modes of transmission (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/57/10/e167.full).

Nepal has problems with unsafe drinking water and inadequate disposal of human excrement. Open defecation is very common in Nepal. According to the 2011 census, almost 40 percent of the total households do not have toilets (http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/National%20Report.pdf). In the least developed districts in the west, 75 percent are said not to have toilets, and public toilets, where available, are not used because of their filth (http://www.irinnews.org/report/90251/nepal-naming-and-shaming-open-defecation-offenders).

Bacterial contamination of drinking water, no matter what the source, is common in Nepal. Only urban areas have piped water supply systems. In other parts of the country, people use natural sources like streams, springs, wells, etc. A large-scale study on fecal contamination of drinking water was done covering all regions of Nepal during 2009-2011 (Rai SK, Ono K, Yanagida JI, et al. A large-scale study of bacterial contamination of drinking water and its public health impact in Nepal. Nepal Med Coll J. 2012;14(3):234-40. Abstract available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24047024): 88.5 percent of water samples were positive for total coliforms (TC) and 56.5 percent were positive for fecal coliforms (FC) (_Escherichia coli_); TC positive rate was very high (81.2 to 100.0 percent) in different type water samples (piped tap: 90.1 percent; boring water: 85.2 percent; natural spout/tap: 81.2 percent; well water: 100.0 percent and mineral water/uroguard treated water: 80.0 percent); FC positive rate ranged from 0.0 percent in mineral water/uroguard-treated water to 93.7 percent in well water samples. (Uroguard is a comparatively expensive electronic filter that is used by hotels and other institutions: https://ejournals.unm.edu/index.php/nsc/article/download/673/770.)

Nepal is a country with a population of more than 28 million people along the Himalayan Mountains that form the border of Nepal and Tibet. Nepal is grouped into 5 regions: each region is divided into zones, and each zone into districts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal#Government). The Saptari District, one of the 75 districts of Nepal, with a population of 639 284 in 2011, is in the Sagarmatha Zone (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saptari_District), as are the neighboring districts of Siraha, with a population of 637 328 in 2011 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siraha_District), and Udayapur, with a population of 317 532 in 2011 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udayapur_District). Rajbiraj, with a population of 37 738 in 2011, which is located in Saptari District, is the main city of the Sagarmatha Zone (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajbiraj). A map of Nepal that shows the location of these districts can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagarmatha_Zone#mediaviewer/File:Sagarmatha_districts.png. - Mod.ML
