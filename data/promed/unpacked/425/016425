At least 1500 dengue fever cases were reported in Cambodia in the 1st 3 months of this year [2013], a 10 percent rise from 1365 cases in the same period last year [2012], a health official said Thursday [11 Apr 2013].

Of the figures, the disease killed 8 children during the January-March period this year [2013], the same number of deaths over the same period last year [2012], Dr Ngan Chantha, director of the Health Ministry's national dengue control program, said. Most patients are children, aged between 5 and 14 years old.

Meanwhile, he urged people to sleep under mosquito nets and keep a clean environment around their houses to prevent the disease.

"Dengue fever is caused by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. To prevent the infection, I'd like to appeal to all parents and guardians to kill larvae by using abate (a chemical substance used to kill larvae in water pots) and by filling in puddles around houses, which are sources of mosquitoes," he said.

Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The disease causes an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, vomiting, and rash.

In Cambodia, the disease outbreak usually begins from the rainy season in May and lasts until October.

Last year [2012], the country recorded 42 362 dengue fever cases, killing 189 children.

Health authorities announced to the press on Monday [1 Apr 2013] in Angola's capital the registration of at least 6 dengue cases at a time when there are rising malaria cases.

The press announcement was made by the director of Public Health of Angola. Adelaide de Carvalho said that 6 dengue cases have been registered by the Luanda General Hospital.

Frequent rains that have hit some regions of the country have multiplied lack of sewerage and drinking water.

The episodes of dengue are thus raising concerns of the authorities, since this disease is viral and does not present the same clinical [picture as] malaria, which is controlled in terms of sanitary health services. The authorities are thus obliged to take quick and effective action to prevent dengue from becoming endemic, which would have unpredictable consequences for the public health of the country.

[ProMED-mail does not usually post reports when there are relatively few dengue cases. However, since dengue reports from Africa are so few, this report from Angola is of interest. It does make one wonder how many dengue infections are misdiagnosed as malaria.
