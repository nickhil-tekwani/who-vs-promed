The epi analysis cited in PLoS (Gambhir M, Clark TA, Cauchemez S, et al: A change in vaccine efficacy and duration of protection explains recent rises in pertussis incidence in the United States. PLoS Comput Biol. 2015; 11(4): e1004138. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138 http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004138) comparing the efficacy and duration of both the whole cell and acellular vaccines mirrors what Australia, and we, here in California, have been experiencing. As a result, pertussis has once again approached endemicity. PAHO, the Pan American Health Organization, has I believe, advised countries which have not yet switched over to acellular pertussis vaccine not to do so, and to continue to utilize whole cell vaccines.

The reason given for our switching to acellular pertussis was the unacceptability of side effects in infants receiving whole cell... the trade-off now being both lower efficacy and shorter duration, with the preponderance of cases now emerging in high school populations.

I would suggest that we look at a hybrid immunization approach which utilizes acellular vaccine for the 1st 3 or even 4 doses (ages 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months) to confer immunity while avoiding the adverse event more common in infancy, with a whole cell vaccine administered at 4-5 years of age, when the vaccine is better tolerated, thus conferring longer lasting immunity, resulting in reducing the overall burden of pertussis in the community and hopefully, bringing us back from the current endemic state to only deal with sporadic cases. I put this forward as an option which I believe needs to be studied. While whole cell pertussis vaccine is no longer currently used in the USA, it was, and should still be licensed for use. It is still being manufactured and used in other countries and so should still be available.

I suggest this because it is clear that simply increasing dosing frequency (that is, possible boosting at transition from middle school to high school) using a less effective acellular vaccine, leaves us complacently resigned to endemicity.

Ultimately, we need a new, re-engineered vaccine which addresses these issues, but this will take large amounts of resources and time, by far, to clear FDA approval.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Benjamin for his comments. While the evolution of new clones of _B. pertussis_ and the presence of an under immunized cohort of individuals may play a role, it certainly appears that the current DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis vaccine) vaccination protocol (1) results in waning pertussis immunity, which creates a reservoir for _B. pertussis_ that can infect infants less than one year of age, and particularly less than 6 months old, who are particularly at risk for morbidity and mortality. Vaccination of the pregnant woman should assist in protecting this susceptible cohort.

A recent paper in Pediatrics (2) included 224 378 children from Minnesota and 179 011 children from Oregon. Both Minnesota and Oregon had very high numbers of pertussis cases in 2010 and 2012. The researchers reviewed 458 of the children in the Minnesota group and 89 of the children in the Oregon group for the full time period studied. Over that time, the number of pertussis cases that occurred rose each year.

During the 1st year of follow-up of the study, a rate of 15.6 out of 100 000 children contracted pertussis in Minnesota. By the 6th year of the study, that rate had risen to 138.4 out of 100 000 children. In Oregon, the rate of pertussis in the 1st year was 6.2 out of 100 000 children, which rose to 24.4 out of 100 000 children by the 6th year of the study.

In Minnesota, a child was twice as likely in the 2nd year of the study as in the 1st year to contract pertussis. By the 6th year, a child was 9 times more likely to catch whooping cough than they were in the 1st year of the study. In Oregon, a child was 30 percent more likely to catch pertussis in the 2nd year of the study than in the 1st year. By the 6th year, children were 4 times more likely to catch pertussis than they were in the 1st year.

An additional recent publication, in Clinical Infectious Disease (3), utilized a large cohort of young people receiving all of their health care at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in San Rafael, California, USA, and reported that a markedly increased risk of pertussis occurred associated with those who received only acellular pertussis vaccine. As compared to those who received at least one dose of the killed, whole cell pertussis vaccine (prior to the switch to all acellular dosing), the relative risk of acquiring pertussis was 8.57 in those receiving 5 doses of the acellular vaccine but fell to a relative risk of 3.55 in those receiving 6 doses of the acellular vaccine.
