Haff Disease Associated with Eating Buffalo Fish, United States, 1997
Haff disease is a syndrome of unexplained rhabdomyolysis following
consumption of certain types of fish; it is caused by an unidentified
toxin. Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by injury to skeletal
muscle that results in release of muscle cell contents into the
circulation. In 1997, six cases of Haff disease were identified in the
United States (four in California and two in Missouri) among persons who
ate buffalo fish (_Ictiobus cyprinellus_), a bottom-feeding species found
mostly in the Mississippi River or its tributaries. This report summarizes
the investigation of these cases...
[MMWR] Editorial Note: During the 1920s, the name "Haff disease" was given
to an illness characterized by severe muscle pain and stiffness that
affected approximately 1000 persons living along the Koenigsberg Haff, a
brackish inlet of the Baltic Sea. Subsequent similar outbreaks were
identified in Sweden and the former Soviet Union. Although the etiology was
not determined, epidemiologic investigations linked illness to ingestion of
fish, especially burbot...
The first reported case of Haff disease in the United States occurred in
Texas in 1984 (M. Tormey, Los Angeles Department of Health Services,
personal communication, 1997); five additional cases were reported in
California during 1984-1986. All U.S. cases have been associated with
eating buffalo fish.
Haff disease typically presents as a paroxysm of rhabdomyolysis, with
accompanying muscle tenderness, rigidity, and dark brown urine. However, as
in patient 3, milder presentations also occur. Although the median
incubation period for the patients in this report was 8 hours (range: 6-21
hours), symptoms generally appear approximately 18 hours after eating fish.
Laboratory features of Haff disease include a markedly elevated CK level
with an MB fraction of less than 5%. Levels of other muscle enzymes (e.g.,
lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxalate transaminase, and glutamate
pyruvate transaminase) also are elevated. Myoglobinuria is often mistaken
for gross hematuria. Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical history.
Treatment is supportive and consists of administering large volumes of
fluid early in the course of illness to prevent myoglobin toxicity to the
renal tubules. Possible complications include electrolyte disturbances,
renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Symptoms usually
resolve within 2-3 days. Historically, the case-fatality rate is
approximately 1%.
Clinicians and public health practitioners are encountering an increasing
variety of foodborne illnesses, in part because of a diversification of
food preparation and eating habits. International travelers, members of
ethnic groups with unique cuisines, and consumers of both imported and
domestic specialty food items may be at risk for foodborne illnesses that
are rare or have not been reported previously in the United States.
Clinicians should be aware of food exposures that pose a risk to their
patients and routinely obtain food histories, even from those patients
whose illness may not appear to be food-related.
Physicians who identify or suspect cases of Haff disease, based on the
clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and food history, should
report them to public health authorities for initiation of traceback and
recall of implicated food items. State health departments are requested to
report to the Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch, Division of
Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases,
CDC, telephone (404) 639-2206.
