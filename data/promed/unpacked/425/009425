A cruise ship is being held in the Essex port of Harwich after a
virus [outbreak] on board [affected] over 100 people. Two
[passengers] are in Colchester Hospital following the outbreak which
authorities decided was too serious to allow the vessel [the "Van
Gogh"] to begin its next journey to Norway.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) confirmed that 14 people
continued to suffer from symptoms of vomiting and diarrhoea as it
docked in Harwich, before explaining that the local director of
public health had insisted that a full-scale cleaning operation on
the ship was required. "We have been in close discussion with both
the local port health inspectors and the director of public health
during the day examining all the options for the well-being of future
passengers on board this vessel. We have also been in contact with
the owners of the vessel and the charter company who have been made
aware of our deliberations this afternoon," explained Captain Andy
Rudge of the MCA
"It is with regret that we have had to take this action, in detaining
the vessel on health advice but clearly passengers' health is the
first priority for all concerned," he said.
Up to 5000 passengers waiting to board the Van Gogh were told they
would not be able to depart for the week-long Norway cruise, which
was set to call at ports including Bergen, Gudvangen and Rosendal.
The ship, owned by Netherlands-based Club Cruise, will be thoroughly
cleaned. Its crew will then carefully monitor any further outbreaks
to establish whether or not additional steps are required.

[It is not clear from this report whether there has been a
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of norovirus infection, but the
response of the port and health authorities is consistent with such a
situation.
Sudden-onset viral gastroenteritis, often described colloquially as
"Winter Vomiting Disease", is a consequence of norovirus infection
and an occasional problem on board cruise ships and in other
situations where diverse groups of people congregate in confined
spaces.
Norovirus-associated viral gastroenteritis is not restricted
geographically and cruise ships in northern latitudes are as
vulnerable as ships in warmer climates. Likewise outbreaks are not
restricted to winter. Effective methods of rapid and thorough
cleaning of cruise ships have been devised that allow rapid
turn-around without risk to new passengers. - Mod.CP]
