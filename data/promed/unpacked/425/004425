West Nile Virus, Birds; UK Surveillance
---------------------------------------
In response to the moderator's question about isolation of arboviruses from
UK birds [see the ProMED-mail post entitled: Arbovirus antibodies, birds -
UK 20040330.0868]; The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) started surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) infection in wild
bird carcasses in 2001. Since then more than 1000 wild bird carcasses (and
a number of carcasses of captive birds kept outdoors) have been examined.
No arboviruses have been isolated, or detected, from this monitoring.
Casualty birds, of 85 species, from a wide range of habitats in England,
Wales, and Scotland were examined. This surveillance is on-going and the
examinations include diagnostic necropsy, histopathology (where nervous
signs are observed), WNV PCR and virus isolation in tissue culture.
There has been no indication of clinical WNV disease or unexplained bird
mortality incidents likely to be associated with an arbovirus from this
study. DEFRA is not aware of any isolations of arboviruses (that is, the
isolation of a West Nile virus, Usutu virus, or Sindbis virus) from British
wild birds made by other laboratories.
The results of WNV surveillance are regularly updated on the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency (VLA) Wildlife Quarterly Reports, available at
<http://defraweb/animalh/diseases/surveillance_reports/index.htm> or
