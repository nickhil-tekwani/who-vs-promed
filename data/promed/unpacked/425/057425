[1a] Mass Testing
Date: Sat 12 Dec 2020

Coronavirus lateral flow tests only pick up 49 per cent of infections because they fail to catch people with low levels of the virus, researchers have found.

The findings of a pilot of 3199 people has blown a hole in the government's mass testing strategy, which featured plans to hand out millions of 30-minute tests to allow Britons to go back to living life normally, it was revealed yesterday [11 Dec 2020].

The lateral flow test, produced by US-based Innova, only picks up 48.89 per cent of active infections, according to a University of Liverpool pilot programme.

It contradicts earlier lab tests, which found the test had an overall sensitivity of 76.8 per cent, rising to 95 per cent in individuals with a high viral load.

The pilot's results come after an audit by the Mail found 4 major care home chains and 9 councils were refusing to use rapid tests for visitors, which establish whether they can be admitted to premises, due to concerns about their accuracy.

Last week, following a Daily Mail campaign, the government promised that millions of the lateral flow tests would be rolled out to care homes by the end of next week so residents and families could be reunited.

It said visitors who tested negative for Covid-19 would be allowed to hold loved-ones for the 1st time in months.

But major providers such as Bupa, MHA, Barchester Care and Anchor Hanover have all refused to trust the results of the tests.

A spokesman for Liverpool City Council has confirmed it won't be asking care homes to allow visitors until the tests' accuracy has improved.

They said: "Although lateral flow testing is considered safe as an extra measure to protect staff, as it relies on repeat testing, it was felt that it may not be safe enough to use on visitors to high-risk settings like care homes who may not have had repeat tests."

The latest research was released yesterday [11 Dec 2020] by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE).

William Irving, professor of virology at Nottingham University, said some of the government's edicts around mass testing were "frankly ridiculous, like rolling out all these tests without proper validation." He added: "We're doing all of this testing on asymptomatic people, and there's no evidence that it's changing anything."

The results of the pilot show that the reliability of the tests cannot be trusted, as the 2 different tests of its effectiveness returned contradictory conclusions.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: "With up to a 3rd of individuals with Covid-19 not displaying symptoms, broadening testing to identify those showing no symptoms and who can infect people unknowingly will mean finding positive cases more quickly and break chains of transmission. The country's leading scientists have rigorously evaluated the Optigene LAMP test and Lateral Flow Test and confirmed the accuracy of the tests for asymptomatic testing."

In a report on Liverpool's mass testing programme, which saw around half of the city's 500 000 residents get tested over the course of a month, officials branded the scheme a success.

Simple laws of statistics mean even a highly accurate test will get huge numbers of results wrong when used on millions of people. They wrote: "Frequently, tests perform slightly less well in the field than in perfect laboratory testing conditions. ... In field evaluations, such as Liverpool, these tests still perform effectively and detect at least 50 per cent of all PCR-positive individuals and more than 70 per cent of individuals with higher viral loads in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals."

Someone's viral load is a way of quantifying how much of the virus they are carrying in their bodies. People with more are generally considered to be more likely to infect others because, as a result of having more inside them, they also shed more.

The tests were compared by using both types on the people who get tested through the official route. A PCR test is the lab test considered to be the gold standard, and the one currently offered to people who have symptoms of Covid-19.

The UK is spending more than GBP one billion [USD 1.32 billion] on rapid coronavirus swab tests to try and achieve Operation Moonshot, an ambition of testing everyone in the country at least once per week.

In a TV briefing at the end of October 2020, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: "We now have the immediate prospect of using many millions of cheap, reliable, and above all rapid turnaround tests that you can use yourself to tell whether or not you are infectious and get the result within 10 to 15 minutes. And we know from trials across the country in schools and hospitals that we can use these tests not just to locate infectious people but to drive down the disease. And so over the next few days and weeks, we plan a steady but massive expansion in the deployment of these quick turnaround tests."

He said they would be applied in "an ever-growing number of situations," including in hospitals to testing "whole towns and even whole cities."

But scientists warn that the tests aren't accurate enough for people to consider themselves Covid-free if they get a negative result.

Loughborough University's Dr Duncan Robertson said in a series of tweets about the Liverpool report: "So, we have a mass testing regime that has large numbers of false negatives. The problem with this is that people may take tests, be told the test is negative, and then believe they are negative. This can put vulnerable people at risk, and those in the communities in which they reside, such as residents in care homes. The vital message is that if you have a negative test, it does not mean you are not infectious or will not be infectious."

The antigen tests can tell whether a person is currently infected with coronavirus -- even if they have no symptoms -- and the technology can give results within an hour.

Every resident in Liverpool has been able to get tested for the disease since Friday [11 Dec 2020], when the major army-backed scheme was 1st launched. The city, home to 500 000 people, was the 1st to be involved with No. 10's ambitious "Operation Moonshot," a mission to screen millions of asymptomatic people every day.

[1b] Easy Home-based testing
Date: Fri 11 Dec 2020
Source: WSJ [edited]
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-year-of-covid-and-hopefully-the-year-of-easy-home-based-testing-11607682603?redirect=amp#click=<https://t.co/gFDMqdiFzC


There is no question that this pandemic has been the defining event of 2020, one that has shuttered economies, caused far too many deaths and will have effects that far outlast this year [2020] and next. For 11 months, all eyes have been focused on ending this pandemic, which is why the recent developments with vaccines are welcoming and positive news.

However, despite the progress being made with vaccines, they won't be widely available to the greater population for a number of months. In addition, we do not yet know how well the vaccine will stop transmission, how long the protective levels will last, and we must always be prepared should the virus evade vaccine protection. We are in a position today where about 2500 Americans are dying each day, hospitals are at capacity, and the country is enduring major lockdowns.

Fortunately, we have the chance to improve things quickly by making simple, inexpensive home-based tests widely available. Because if there's anything we've learned from 2020 in health care, it's this: Traditional lab-based tests are too expensive and too slow for a fast-spreading virus.

Fixing this problem won't just save lives in the months ahead. It also will help bring about long-term changes in health care by putting more power into the hands of patients and boosting public health by helping curb the spread of a range of diseases.

The good news is that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can effectively be detected using simple, paper-strip antigen tests that are inexpensive, relatively easy to manufacture, and report results within minutes. Every single American household could have a pack of 20 tests within weeks if the U.S. government invested a mere USD one billion to build capacity to produce them. For reference, this is less than 0.1% of what this virus has cost us.

By using these simple, inexpensive, rapid tests once or twice a week, individuals can know their status even when they are asymptomatic, and, therefore, reduce transmission before the virus can spread.

It is my profound hope that before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on 20 Jan 2020, these inexpensive tests will have already reached a significant portion of the American public.

This health-care breakthrough won't only stop the spread of the coronavirus, but also change the approach to health care for the future. Why? Because it further simplifies and democratizes care.

A silver lining of the pandemic has been the tremendous progress with telehealth and telemedicine, using the technology we have at our fingertips. This has allowed doctors to see more patients and in turn given patients greater access to their health-care network.

Likewise, individuals are craving the freedom to know their own health status. Giving them this freedom will have tremendous effects not just for individuals but for public health. Obviously, preventing the spread of Covid-19 is the immediate concern. But think of the societal benefits -- economic and otherwise -- if people tested themselves for the flu before going to work. Or if they screened toddlers for a respiratory virus before sending them off to day care.

It all begins with ramping up production of simple tests for the Covid-19 antigen. The investment required is minuscule compared with the cost of this virus. And this effort would be a foundation of medical-testing technology and manufacturing on our own soil, as the same plants that produce Covid-19 tests could provide other types of at-home tests for years to come.

Yet there are significant roadblocks in the way. Our current regulatory structure is preventing potential manufacturers from producing the amount of antigen tests this country needs. And the current rules make it difficult for people to simply obtain and use tests themselves.

Right now, if patients want to administer the 1st at-home Covid-19 test to receive Food and Drug Administration emergency-use authorization, they must get a doctor's prescription and have a telehealth appointment. This isn't sustainable for public-health screening tools meant to detect the disease and stop its spread.

In the same way pregnancy tests are allowed in the home, Covid-19 and flu tests should be as well. Critics worry that the public cannot be trusted to administer their own tests and know their own health status. Yet we trust diabetics to administer their own insulin injections and treatment every day.

This pandemic has been a learning experience for many of us, and even though we are still living history, we need to act with the information we have today to save lives and to get our lives back. The breakthrough of at-home rapid antigen Covid-19 testing is one of the silver linings of 2020, and it will provide a playbook for our country's long-term investment in at-home testing for the future.

[2] Smartwatch Data for early COVID-19 Detection

Early this year [2020], investigators at the Scripps Research Translational Institute found that resting heart rate and sleep data from wearable sensors could predict population-level trends in influenza-like illness. Now, a new study from the same team suggests that wearable sensor data combined with self-reported symptoms might aid in the early detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The COVID-19 findings are from the ongoing Digital Engagement and Tracking for Early Control and Treatment (DETECT) study, a collaboration with healthcare technology company Care Evolution. The researchers analyzed data from 333 participants who entered both symptoms and test results into the DETECT smartphone app, which also collected heart rate, sleep, and activity data from the individuals' commercial wearable devices.

54 participants reported testing positive for COVID-19. A model that analyzed both sensor data and symptoms more accurately discriminated between positive and negative cases than one that considered symptoms alone. The approach looks for changes in an individual's own biometrics, a better health indicator than deviations from population averages, the researchers said.

"DETECT could play an important role in alerting individuals that they may have contracted the virus," Giorgio Quer, PhD, director of artificial intelligence at Scripps and the study's lead author, said in an email. Quer's team is now working on an algorithm that also identifies pre-symptomatic or even asymptomatic individuals. "This would be especially valuable, as people may be already infectious during this period, and may unknowingly spread the virus," he said.

Only 1 in 5 people in the US wears a smartwatch or activity tracker, however. If future research confirms the devices can be used to improve health, the "gap in usage will need to be proactively addressed to assure health equity," the researchers wrote in Nature Medicine.

[3] EUA for Bamlanivimab - A Monoclonal Antibody for COVID-19
Date: Fri 11 Dec 2020
Source: JAMA [edited]
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2774326?utm_source=silverchair&utm_campaign=jama_network&utm_content=covid_weekly_highlights&utm_medium=email


The investigational neutralizing IgG1 monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555; Lilly) has been granted an FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for treatment of recently diagnosed mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who are 12 years old or older, weigh at least 40 kg [88 lbs.], and are at high risk for progressing to severe disease and/or hospitalization.

Eligible Patients Considered High Risk
------------
Patients with one or more of the following:
- BMI 35 or higher
- Chronic kidney disease
- Diabetes
- Immunosuppressive disease
- Currently receiving immunosuppressive treatment
- 65 years old or older
Patients 55 years old or older and with one or more of the following conditions:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Hypertension
- COPD or other chronic respiratory disease
Patients 12-17 Years Old and with one or more of the following conditions:
- BMI 85th percentile or higher for their age and gender
- Sickle cell disease
- Congenital or acquired heart disease
- Neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy)
- A medical-related technological dependence (e.g. tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation [not related to COVID-19])
- Asthma, reactive airway, or other chronic respiratory disease that requires daily treatment

Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

a) Patients 12 years or older who weigh 40 kg [88 lbs.] or more with one or more of the criteria listed are considered at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. FDA fact sheet for healthcare providers emergency use authorization (EUA) of bamlanivimab. Available at: https://www.fda.gov/media/143603/download. Accessed 19 Nov 2020.

b) Based on CDC growth charts (https://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm).
Monoclonal antibodies, such as bamlanivimab, may be associated with worse clinical outcomes when administered to hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation. Bamlanivimab is not authorized for use in patients who are hospitalized or require oxygen therapy because of COVID-19.

Mechanism of Action
Bamlanivimab binds to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, blocking the spike protein's attachment to the human ACE2 receptor.

Clinical Studies
In an interim analysis of an ongoing phase 2 trial (BLAZE-1), 452 outpatients with recently diagnosed mild or moderate COVID-19 (within 3 days of 1st positive test) were randomized to receive a single IV infusion of one of 3 doses of LY-CoV555 or placebo. The primary endpoint was the decrease from baseline in SARS-CoV-2 viral load on day 11. The decrease was significantly greater with a 2800-mg dose of the antibody than with placebo, but not with 700- and 7000-mg doses, possibly because most patients, including those treated with placebo, had effectively cleared the virus by day 11.

The predefined secondary endpoint of hospitalization or emergency department visit for COVID-19 by day 29 occurred in 1.6% of antibody recipients and 6.3% of placebo recipients. In a post-hoc analysis of patients at high risk (BMI 35 or higher or 65 years or older) for disease progression, 4 of 95 patients (4%) who were treated with LY-CoV555 were hospitalized or visited the emergency department, compared to 7 of 48 (15%) of those treated with placebo.

Hospitalized Patients
------------------
The NIH ACTIV-3 trial, which is evaluating multiple investigational agents in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, stopped randomizing patients to treatment with LY-CoV555 based on an analysis suggesting that the antibody was not beneficial in this population.

Adverse Effects
In the BLAZE-1 trial, nausea occurred in 3.9%, dizziness in 3.2%, and mild infusion reactions in 2.3% of antibody recipients, compared to 3.5%, 2.1%, and 1.4%, respectively, of placebo recipients. According to the FDA's fact sheet for the EUA, one anaphylactic reaction and one serious infusion-related reaction were reported with infusion of bamlanivimab in ongoing, blinded trials.

Dosage and Administration
-------------------
Bamlanivimab is authorized for administration as a single 700-mg IV infusion over at least 60 minutes. The drug should be given as soon as possible after a SARS-CoV-2 positive test result and within 10 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Patients should be treated in a facility staffed and equipped to manage anaphylaxis, and they should be monitored for hypersensitivity reactions during administration of the drug and for at least one hour after completion of the infusion.

The diluted solution for infusion should be used immediately after it is prepared. If immediate use is not possible, it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours or at room temperature for up to 7 hours, including infusion time.

Availability
-----------
Bamlanivimab will be allocated to state health departments by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) based on case counts and severity of outbreaks. These state health departments will be responsible for allocating the antibody to local health facilities. Finding facilities equipped to administer an IV infusion and capable of managing anaphylaxis while not exposing uninfected patients to SARS-CoV-2 may be difficult.

Conclusion
----------
The investigational IV monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) has been granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA based on its association with a reduction in emergency department visits and hospitalizations in recently diagnosed patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 considered to be at high risk of progressing to severe disease and/or hospitalization. The drug needs to be infused over one hour in a facility equipped to manage anaphylaxis. Bamlanivimab has not been beneficial in hospitalized patients.

[Bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) is a recombinant neutralising monoclonal antibody intended for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19. Developed by Eli Lilly and Company, Bamlanivimab secured emergency use authorisation (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2020. Covid-19 test-positive adults and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older, who are at high risk of progression to severe Covid-19 and hospitalisation, are eligible to receive the drug. Bamlanivimab should be administered to the patients promptly, following a positive COVID-19 test and within 10 days of onset of symptoms.

Bamlanivimab is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody and acts by binding to the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and prevents the attachment of spike protein with the human ACE2 (a cell surface protein) receptor.

The emergency use authorisation of Bamlanivimab is based on the interim results of an ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial, named BLAZE-1, which was performed in 465 non-hospitalised adults with mild to moderate Covid-19 symptoms and tested for Covid-19 based on the sample collected not before 3 days of infusing the drug.

The patients were randomised to receive a single infusion of 700mg (N=101), 2800mg (N=107), 7000mg (N=101) of bamlanivimab, or placebo (N=156).

The predetermined primary endpoint of the clinical trial was an improvement in viral load from baseline to Day 11. Most of the patients effectively cleared the viral load by Day 11.

The secondary outcome was Covid-19-related hospitalisations or emergency room visits within 28 days of treatment. Approximately 1% to 2% of the bamlanivimab-treated patients required hospitalisations or emergency room visits within 28 days compared to 6% of patients treated with placebo. A smaller number of bamlanivimab-treated patients who are at high risk for disease progression (3%) led to Covid-19-related hospitalisations or emergency department visits compared with placebo-treated patients (10%). The absolute risk reduction for bamlanivimab compared to placebo is greater in patients at higher risk of hospitalisation based on high-risk criteria.

The adverse events observed in patients in the BLAZE-1 trial were vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, headache, dizziness, and itchy skin; https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/projects/ bamlanivimab-ly-cov555-for-the-treatment-of-covid-19/. - Mod.UBA]

[4a] Sanofi and GSK delay Covid vaccine delays
Date: Thu 10 Dec 2020
Source: Bloomberg [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-11/sanofi-gsk-delay-covid-vaccine-after-elderly-get-little-boost


Vaccine makers, including 2 of the largest in the world, suffered setbacks in the push to get more Covid-19 shots across the line, tempering a run of positive news.

Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline Plc delayed advanced trials of their experimental Covid-19 shot after it failed to produce a strong enough response in older people, pushing its potential availability to the end of next year [2021]. In another blow, trials of a vaccine being developed by CSL Ltd. and the University of Queensland in Australia ran into difficulties.

Sanofi and its U.K. partner will begin a new 2nd-phase study with a more concentrated antigen in February 2021 after they said the current dosage failed to generate a good immune response in people 50 years and older. Younger adults showed a response similar to patients who have recovered from the disease.

The problem arose after 2 different reagents used to measure vaccine formulations provided inaccurate information about the concentration of antigens, Sanofi said in an emailed statement. The companies notified U.S. officials about the matter.

The delay underscores the difficulties and uncertainties companies face in developing shots in record time against a disease that's already claimed more than 1.5 million lives. It's also a blow for governments that were counting on supplies from the 2 vaccine giants amid expectations the world will need multiple inoculations to stop the spread of the pathogen.

Australia meanwhile canceled an order for 51 million doses of a Covid shot being developed by CSL and the Australian university. A component of the vaccine comes from the human immunodeficiency virus, and while that posed no risk of infection, some trial participants had false positive tests for HIV.

The announcements temper some of the optimism following positive trial results from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. Another inoculation from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford looks promising, too, despite questions about its effectiveness in older adults. The U.K. and Canada have already approved a shot from Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE that employs messenger RNA technology, and the U.S. and Europe may do so soon. China and Russia have already begun administering their own vaccinations.

Sanofi fell as much as 3.3% Friday [11 Dec 2020] in Paris, while Glaxo was little changed in London.

The delay to the Sanofi-GSK vaccine means it may not reach the market until the 4th quarter of 2021 rather than the middle of the year. A study using an improved antigen mix, exposing monkeys to the virus, showed a rapid clearance of the pathogen from the nose and lungs.

The companies are planning a new trial that could include a head-to-head comparison with an approved Covid-19 vaccine to speed research. The companies haven't disclosed how many people will be included. Advanced-stage tests could start in the 2nd quarter of next year [2021].

"We want our vaccine to protect everyone, including populations most vulnerable to Covid-19," Sanofi said. "Therefore, we need to refine our candidate's antigen formulation to provide a high-level of protection across all age adults."

This particular candidate relies on recombinant DNA technology Sanofi uses to make influenza shots, along with Glaxo's adjuvants, which enhance the body's immune response. The companies previously said they expected to produce as many as one billion doses in 2021.

Sanofi has another mRNA shot for Covid in development, and GSK is involved in a handful of other collaborations for Covid.

The recombinant DNA approach received approval in the U.S. for combating the flu in 2013. It's a synthetic process that aims to produce an exact genetic match of proteins found on the surface of the virus.

The delay highlights the challenges a number of 2nd generation Covid-19 vaccines could face now that the 1st shots are being approved. One potential benefit of a comparator trial arm with another Covid-19 vaccine will be recruitment. With as many as 3 approved vaccines possibly available in the coming weeks, studies for those further back in the development process may need to rethink incentives to keep enrollment up.

The biggest orders for the vaccine include the European Union, which has agreed to buy 300 million doses, and the U.S., which is purchasing 100 million with an option for more. Sanofi and GSK have intended to provide 200 million doses of their vaccine to the Covax program, which is aimed at distributing shots equitably all over the world.

Glaxo is also developing vaccines with Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals Inc. of China, which reported last week that the shot had induced neutralizing antibodies in early-stage trials. The U.K. company has also begun late-stage trials for a vaccine with Canada's Medicago Inc.

[As the human phase trails of the various vaccines gearing up for authorization and approval continue, new challenges continue to emerge. A few basic facts about RNA and DNA vaccines are important for general understanding: RNA vaccines have a broader safety index and are immunogenic but are highly dependent on the "cold chain" compared to other types of vaccines. On the other hand, DNA vaccines are generally less immunogenic than RNA vaccines in terms of antibody responses, but can be stored at room temperature and may be more effective in the induction of T-cell responses. Vector based vaccines such as Adenovirus vaccines are immunogenic and easy to manufacture; however, they are less suitable for repeat immunization (e.g. booster shots) due to the development of anti-adenovirus vector immunity.

The Sanofi-GSK vaccine is an adjuvanted, recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine. 200 million doses of this vaccine were to be made available to the COVAX facility. The COVAX Facility is part of COVAX, a global collaboration of governments, global health organizations, businesses and philanthropic organizations working to accelerate development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO and forms the vaccines pillar of the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. More than 180 countries and economies recently signed onto the COVAX Facility to get timely and cost-effective access to vaccines to meet the global scale of the COVID-19 pandemic [https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-10-28-07-00-00].

In addition to the recombinant protein-based vaccine in collaboration with GSK, Sanofi is developing a messenger RNA vaccine in partnership with Translate Bio.

2nd, or Next-generation vaccines are being designed to fix potential shortcomings of 1st-generation vaccines with regards to cost of scale-up, needle-free delivery, single-shot efficacy, long-term immunity & immunity in special populations (e.g. elderly adults), as well as minimization of dependence on the cold chain. - Mod.UBA]

[4b] FDA Accords EUA for Pfizer-BioN Tech Vaccine
Date: Fri 11 Dec 2020
Source: Stat News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/11/fda-grants-historic-authorization-to-a-covid-19-vaccine-setting-stage-for-rollout/?utm_source=STAT+ Newsletters&utm_campaign =9f357d8e75-breaking_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-9f357d8e75-145252141


The Food and Drug Administration on Friday [11 Dec 2020] issued an emergency authorization for a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, a seminal moment in the effort to curb a pandemic that has so far infected an estimated 16 million people and killed nearly 300 000 in the United States.

The decision means vaccinations will begin in a matter of days in individuals 16 years of age or older. Initial supplies of the vaccine are expected to be used primarily in 2 groups most at risk of getting infected or developing severe disease: health care providers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities.

The vaccine is the 1st to be authorized in the United States, and has already been authorized in the United Kingdom, Canada, and several other countries. But neither in those countries nor in the United States is the vaccine expected to be a panacea for the pandemic.

While the vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of developing symptomatic Covid-19 infection by about 95% in Phase 3 clinical trials, a number of factors may constrain its potential to turn the pandemic's tide, at least in the short term. Among other issues: Initial supplies of the vaccine are extremely limited; many Americans are reluctant to take the vaccine at all; and in certain populations, including people who are pregnant and children, the vaccine has not yet been tested.

Importantly, while the vaccine reduces the risk of developing symptomatic infection, it's not yet clear whether it also reduces transmission of the virus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2. It's possible that people who are vaccinated can still contract the virus and then transmit it to others, though they themselves would not get sick. As a result, health officials are urging everyone, including the vaccinated, to continue to practice social distancing measures and to wear masks.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was developed at breakneck speed, and the Trump administration agreed over the summer to an initial USD 1.95 billion purchase of 100 million doses before knowing whether it would be safe and effective.

In clinical trials, it proved to be both. The most common side effects included pain at the injection site, fatigue, and fever. Serious adverse reactions were rare. In a 44 000-volunteer study, there were 4 cases of Bell's palsy, a temporary weakness or paralysis, in the vaccine arm and none in the placebo arm. There were also 64 cases of lymphadenopathy, a swelling of the lymph nodes in the vaccine group versus 6 in the placebo group. Those cases all resolved.

The FDA's decision follows the recommendation of an advisory committee that an emergency use authorization be granted to the vaccine. The same committee is scheduled to meet on 17 Dec 2020 to review data on a vaccine developed by Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Massachusetts. Its vaccine had efficacy levels similar to Pfizer's and is based on the same technology, known as messenger RNA. It is widely expected to be authorized.

Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. effort to fast-track development of Covid-19 vaccines, currently estimates that it will have enough vaccine for 20 million people by the end of December 2020 between the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.

A number of other vaccine candidates are still in clinical trials.

The rollout of any vaccine is expected to be complex, and there remain concerns about vaccine makers' ability to scale up manufacturing to meet demand, not just in the United States but globally. Still, the development and distribution of a vaccine less than a year after the emergence of an unknown pathogen is widely considered a feat once thought impossible.

[The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine contains messenger RNA (mRNA), which is genetic material. The vaccine contains a small piece of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's mRNA that instructs cells in the body to make the virus's distinctive "spike" protein. When a person receives this vaccine, their body produces copies of the spike protein, which does not cause disease, but triggers the immune system to learn to react defensively, producing an immune response against SARS-CoV-2; https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/ fda-takes-key-action-fight-against-covid-19-issuing-emergency-use-authorization-1st-covid-19.

[4c] US vaccine rollout plans
Date: Sat 12 Dec 2020

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/12/us-to-buy-100m-more-doses-of-moderna-vaccine-as-rollout-planned


The United States government will receive an additional 100 million doses of Moderna Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, the company said on Friday [11 Dec 2020], as the country prepares for a vaccine roll-out that officials hope will help get the surging pandemic under control.

The US has ordered a total of 200 million doses to date, Moderna said, adding that of the 1st order, about 20 million doses will be delivered by the end of December 2020, and the rest will come in the 1st quarter of 2021.

The US in August 2020 entered into an agreement with Moderna to acquire 100 million doses of its potential COVID-19 vaccine for about USD 1.5 billion, with an option to secure an additional 400 million doses.

The country has recorded more than 15.7 million COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began -- the most in the world -- and infections are surging across the US, overwhelming many hospitals and healthcare workers.

A panel of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is scheduled to hold a meeting on 17 Dec 2020 to discuss Moderna's request for an emergency use authorisation for its vaccine.

The FDA is expected to issue an authorisation for a Pfizer-BioNTech 2-dose COVID-19 vaccine in the coming days, US officials said on Fri 11 Dec 2020, after the FDA advisory panel endorsed that vaccine a day earlier.

"The FDA informed Pfizer that they do intend to proceed towards an authorisation for their vaccine," Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC News on Fri 11 Dec 2020.

The US is preparing a widespread campaign to deliver the vaccine and slow a pandemic now killing about 3000 citizens per day.

Another 2902 virus-related deaths were reported on Thu 10 Dec 2020, a day after a record 3253 people died, a pace projected to continue for the next 2 to 3 months even with a rapid roll-out of inoculations.

"We will work with Pfizer to get that shipped out, so we could be seeing people getting vaccinated Monday or Tuesday [14-15 Dec 2020]," Azar said.

A US vaccine roll-out faces significant logistical challenges, however, to meet President-elect Joe Biden's goal of inoculating 100 million people within 100 days of his inauguration on 20 Jan 2020, including coordination between national, state and local authorities.

But anyone who wants a vaccine should be able to get one by May or June 2020, Assistant US Health Secretary Brett Giroir told Fox News on Fri 11 Dec 2020.

States have begun to announce their initial expectations for vaccine doses and their distribution plans.

New York state expects to receive 346 000 doses of the Moderna vaccine the week of 21 Dec 2020, on top of the 170 000 Pfizer doses coming this weekend, Governor Andrew Cuomo said during a news conference.

New York City, one of the original US hot spots, will open a "Vaccine Command Center" to coordinate distribution throughout the city. Particular attention will be paid to the 27 hardest-hit neighbourhoods, largely populated by ethnic minorities, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Fri 11 Dec 2020 during a news briefing.

States will determine who gets the vaccine 1st and are likely to focus on healthcare workers and people in long-term care facilities, followed by the elderly, people with chronic conditions, and 1st responders, Giroir said. A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advisory board has recommended to 1st vaccinate the elderly and healthcare workers. Michigan expects to receive 257 000 vaccine doses initially, including 173 000 Moderna vaccines, the state's chief medical executive, Dr Joneigh Khaldun, said at a Thu 10 Dec 2020 news conference.

"The initial groups who will be vaccinated will be critical workers in our healthcare systems, including people working in hospitals, people who are 1st responders, and more," Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer also said.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet)].

Data by country, area, or territory for 12 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC12_1607866365.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 46.2% of daily case numbers and 41.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 29.7 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Chile, Panama, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Dominican Republic, and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 40.4% of daily case numbers and 46.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 21.6 million. Countries not reporting cases today (12 Dec 2020) include Israel, and Kazakhstan. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Russia, Germany, UK, Italy, Poland and Ukraine. There are 19 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.2% of daily case numbers and 4.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.46 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Pakistan, Morocco, Jordan, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, and the UAE. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Oman, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 1.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.61 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Nigeria, Uganda, Algeria, Cabo Verde, Botswana, and Namibia. Many countries in the region did not report cases for the last 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.45% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.95 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, and Guam.
