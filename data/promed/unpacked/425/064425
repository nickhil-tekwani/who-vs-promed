Listeriosis associated with stone fruit -- United States, 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Jackson BR, Salter M, Tarr C, et al]

On 19 Jul 2014, a packing company in California (company A) voluntarily recalled certain lots of stone fruits, including whole peaches, nectarines, plums, and pluots, because of concern about contamination with _Listeria monocytogenes_ based on internal company testing (1). On 31 Jul 2014, the recall was expanded to cover all fruit packed at their facility during 1 Jun 2014-17 Jul 2014 (2). After the initial recall, clinicians, state and local health departments, CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received many inquiries about listeriosis from concerned consumers, many of whom had received automated telephone calls informing them that they had purchased recalled fruit. During 19-31 Jul 2014, the CDC _Listeria_ website received more than 500 000 page views, more than 7 times the views received during the previous 52 weeks. However, no molecular information from _L. monocytogenes_ isolates was available to assess whether human illnesses might be linked to these products.

In early August 2014, a 2-enzyme pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern shared by 3 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates from stone fruit associated with the recall was uploaded to PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance. 4 human isolates with isolation dates during the period 8 May 2014-8 Jul 2014 (Illinois, Massachusetts, and South Carolina) and 28 Aug 2014 (Minnesota) were identified that had PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from company A stone fruit. Samples of stone fruits from company A collected after the recall yielded an additional 31 _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, 22 of which were indistinguishable from the initial isolates by PFGE; 3 other PFGE patterns were identified that did not match any isolates from clinical specimens collected during 1 May-31 Aug 2014. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis by whole-genome multilocus sequence typing showed that isolates from the Massachusetts and Minnesota patients were highly related (less than 10 allele differences and less than 10 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism differences) to the isolates from recalled stone fruits, whereas the Illinois and South Carolina isolates were not.

A review of the standardized _Listeria_ Initiative exposure questionnaire (3) for the Massachusetts patient showed that organic nectarine consumption was recorded, although the form does not specifically ask about stone fruit consumption. A subsequent interview using a questionnaire with questions about stone fruits indicated that the patient consumed nectarines and peaches purchased from stores that sold company A stone fruit. Traceback using receipts and shopper card data indicated the patient's family purchased recalled fruit. An interview with a family member of the Minnesota patient revealed that the patient consumed peaches from a store that received company A stone fruit; however, dates from receipts indicated that the peaches were purchased after the recalled fruit was reported to have been removed from the shelves. After removal of recalled fruit, the store received company A peaches that were not part of the recall as well as peaches from another California supplier. The South Carolina patient reportedly did not eat stone fruit before becoming ill. Family of the Illinois patient could not be reached for interview.

Strong evidence linked the Massachusetts case to recalled stone fruit, including food exposure interviews, receipt and shopper card data, and WGS results showing very high genetic relatedness between the patient's isolate and isolates from nectarines. Consumption data and WGS results suggest that stone fruit was also the likely source of _L. monocytogenes_ infection in the Minnesota case; however, the later dates of illness onset and fruit purchase suggest that the patient consumed stone fruit that was not included in the recall.

This is the 1st reported link between human listeriosis and stone fruit. WGS results provided a basis for focusing resources for extended case interviews and follow-up. Specifically, among cases that matched the recalled stone fruit by PFGE, WGS allowed differentiation between sporadic cases and cases associated with stone fruit consumption.

Reported listeriosis is much more common in pregnant women than in the general population and can cause major fetal and perinatal complications. Because of this higher risk, and partially in response to public concern stemming from these recalls, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued guidelines for management of pregnant women with possible _L. monocytogenes_ exposure (4). Although exposure to this recalled product was likely widespread, disease was very rare. Therefore, this recall and associated illness does not provide sufficient evidence to recommend that persons at higher risk for listeriosis (such as, pregnant women, persons aged 65 years or older, and immunocompromised persons) avoid fresh stone fruits. However, it does support the need to understand risks associated with contaminated, ready-to-eat fresh fruit so that prevention strategies can be strengthened.

[As stated in the post, this is the 1st link between stone fruit and human listeriosis.

The name pluot was not known to me. The strangely named "pluot(R)" (http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-pluots.htm) is a hybrid plant grown from a plum and an apricot. They are extremely sweet, due to very high sugar levels, and are available in a wide range of varieties. The actual ratio works out to around 70 percent plum and 30 apricot and they mainly look like plums. They have a great deal of nutritious value and are low in fat, making them ideal for snacking or sweetening up other dishes.

Pluots are sometimes also referred to as "dinosaur eggs(R)" due to the strange dappled coloring on some types of the fruit. The name has actually been trademarked by a California pluot grower, though there are still a wide range of available types with other strange-sounding names. Varieties such as the "flavor grenade," "dapple dandy," and "flavorglo" are fairly common, as are the "hand grenade" and the "last chance." The "flavor heart" is one of the largest types of pluot, heart shaped with black coloring and yellow flesh, while the "candy stripe" has pink and yellow stripes with spotted red skin (see varieties at http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/31/31/21/6657137/3/622x350.jpg. - Mod.LL
