Practicums for student teachers at the University of Prince Edward
Island [UPEI] have been postponed after 3 students came down with the
mumps, CBC News reported Wednesday [24 Oct 2007]. "Until further
notice ... our education students are not in the schools fulfilling
practicum requirements," said Tamara Leary, acting director of
student services at UPEI.

Leary said the last case of mumps was diagnosed on 12 Oct 2007. If no
new cases are reported, UPEI education students should be back in
classrooms to do practical teaching on 19 Nov 2007.

[The 2007 Canadian mumps epidemic, originating in the province of New
Brunswick, spread westwards with dispersal of university students at
the end of term from the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
to Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia. A comprehensive account of
the epidemic by the Canadian Public Health Agency, updated to 12 Oct
2007 and including an epidemiologic curve, is available at
<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/mumps-oreillons/prof_e.html>.

As of 12 Oct 2007, 847 confirmed cases of mumps related to the
outbreak have been reported from 9 out of 13 Canadian provinces and
territories (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island,
Newfoundland, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, and British
Columbia). The outbreak activity remains centered in Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick localities with sporadic exportations to other provinces.

All cases investigated in the outbreak could be either linked to
cases in the Maritimes or are close contacts of these cases. To date,
there has been no sustained transmission outside of the Maritimes
related to the outbreak, although other imported or sporadic cases of
mumps may also occur. The viral strain in these outbreaks is
identical to the strain (genotype G) detected from the 2005-06 Nova
Scotia outbreaks, the United States' multi-state outbreak in 2006 and
the United Kingdom epidemic between 2004 and 2006.

The case reported above appears to be only the 3rd case to be
reported in PEI during the course of the outbreak and the 1st since
May 2007. Clarification is requested. - Mod.CP]
