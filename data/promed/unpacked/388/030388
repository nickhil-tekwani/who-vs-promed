[1] Oilseed rape

Oilseed rape growers are being alerted to the threat of light leaf spot as the industry's most serious disease has been seen from Scotland to Herefordshire.

The disease, which can cut yields by up to 1.5t/ha, is being picked up on susceptible varieties, and experts say where the disease is seen, growers should look to use a fungicide when they can travel on the land.

Identification of the disease in the growing crop is often difficult because symptoms are not always visible and are easily confused with other plant disorders.

Light leaf spot has been reported in the East of England on broccoli and is active in oilseed rape crops. Early symptoms can be difficult to diagnose. Incubation of plants in a plastic bag can help as white spore droplets can form around the lesion.

ADAS [independent provider of agricultural and environmental consultancy, rural development services and policy advice] has warned that [light leaf spot] continues to be seen in East Anglia on cabbages and Brussels sprouts and is increasing in susceptible varieties.

ADAS has warned to be vigilant for signs on cauliflower, where the base of the petiole shows dirty black or pink-coloured lesions on trimmed heads. Light leaf spot was present in vegetable brassicas in Lincolnshire from October 2016

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. In oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_), leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain symptomless until lesions appear on older leaves. In severe cases, developing leaves and buds can be affected causing leaf distortion and stunting of plants. Stems may split and break off. Developing pods are often infected, leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter. Different vegetable brassicas vary in susceptibility to the fungus, but generally show spots and discolourations on leaves and stems which reduce quality and may also affect yield.

LLS is polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer oilseed rape and vegetable brassicas. Spores are spread by wind, rain splash and with infected plant material. Disease management may include varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility, removal of infected stubble, disease monitoring and timely fungicide applications.

In the UK, LLS has caused considerable yield losses of oilseed rape in the past estimated at GBP 40 million per year.
