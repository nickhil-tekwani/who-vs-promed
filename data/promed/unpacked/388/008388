Witches' broom disease of lime in Iran
--------------------------------------
Witches' broom disease (WBDL) is a very serious disease of acid lime
(_Citrus aurantifolia_) that has devastated the lime industry in
Iran. In 1998, 51 infected trees were found but in 2008 the number of
infected trees was over 500 000 and many hectares of the cultivated
area in limes had been destroyed. Based on damage assessments and
gross estimates of decline between 1997 and 2008, and with the
uncontrolled spread of the disease in the current absence of any
proper control treatments, the production of lime is likely to cease
within another 5 years.

Due to the importance [of the disease], the Iranian Witches' Broom
Disease of Lime Network (IWBDLN) was established under the
supervision of the Iranian Ministry of Agriculture. The purpose is to
use all national and international scientific potential to manage and
control the disease, compile information, and to assist in research
programs.

[Witches' broom of lime is caused by _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
aurantifolia, type member of the 16SrII phytoplasma group. It was the
1st phytoplasma disease described for citrus and has also been
reported from the Sultanate of Oman, the United Arab Emirates, and
India. So far, the only known natural host is the small-fruited acid
lime _Citrus aurantifolia_, but more information on the host range is
needed. Symptoms include abnormal chlorotic proliferations of small
shoots (called witches' broom, a common symptom of phytoplasma
infections), followed by dieback of affected branches and eventual
death of the tree within a few years. The pathogen is transmitted by
grafting, but an insect vector, like for many other phytoplasmas, is
also suspected because the disease spreads amongst ungrafted trees as
well.

Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally
includes vector control, removal of infected plants and other sources
of inoculum, and use of certified clean planting material. However,
such measures require tremendous coordinated efforts on a regional
scale and have apparently failed in all countries where WBDL has been
reported so far. In Oman, for example, the current infection rate of
limes has been estimated as 98 percent, and it must be feared that
the epidemic in Iran may lead to a similar situation.
