Ticks are especially dangerous this year [2022].

In Buryatia, as of 30 Aug [2022], 4231 people bitten by ticks sought medical help this summer, including ticks bit 1152 children. Bites were recorded in all regions of the republic and in Ulan-Ude [capital city of the republic].

The rate of infection amounted to 441.8 per 100 000 of the population, which is 22% higher than the average multi-year level, the department of Rospotrebnadzor in Buryatia reported.

Just in the past week, 66 people turned to doctors for help.

Already 100 cases of infections transmitted by ticks have been registered: 44 tick-borne viral encephalitis, 44 tick-borne borreliosis, and 12 tick-borne rickettsiosis.

Tick infections are very serious diseases. Tick-borne encephalitis is especially dangerous: it can cause disability or lead to death. In a severe form, paresis (decrease in muscle strength) and paralysis develop.

As Baikal-Daily reported, tick activity this year [2022] has doubled. The situation with tick-borne infections is much worse than in previous years.

According to the results of studies by epidemiologists, there is an increased activity of ticks. Compared to last year [2021], their number has doubled. In addition, there is a 5-fold increase in infected ticks. If earlier only 2% of ticks could cause tick-borne encephalitis, then this year [2022] it is 10%, Elena Silchenko, deputy head physician of the infectious diseases hospital, reported earlier.

"According to the latest data, we are seeing an increase in tick-borne borreliosis. This is a bacterial infection. I want to state the fact that for the 1st time in many years we have seen an acute form of neuroborreliosis. This is a severe form of borreliosis with damage to the central nervous system. In this case, the patient's prognosis is very doubtful and difficult," said the head physician of the infectious diseases hospital Tatyana Symbelova.

In case of an attack and bite of a tick, it is necessary to immediately contact a medical institution: residents of the districts to the ambulance station, to the clinic of the central district hospital; residents of Ulan-Ude to the emergency department of the branch of the Republic Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital on the street Pirogova, 9a.

You can hand over a tick for laboratory investigation on pathogens of tick-borne infections at the following addresses:
- Center for Hygiene and Epidemiology, Ulan-Ude, st. Klyuchevskaya, 45b (working days, Sunday);
- Republican Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital, Ulan-Ude, st. Pirogova, 9a (working days, Saturday).

[Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus infections in Russia are common. This is the season of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia, and tick bites are very common in Buryat this year (2022). No mention was made in the above report if the TBE virus-infected individuals had been vaccinated against the virus.

TBE is caused by the TBE virus, an RNA virus that belongs to the genus _Flavivirus_ and is closely related to Powassan virus. TBEV has 3 subtypes: European, Siberian, and Far Eastern. TBEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick of the _Ixodes_ species, primarily _I. ricinus_ (in Europe) or _I. persulcatus_ (in Siberia and Far Eastern Russia). Ticks are both vector and virus reservoir, and small rodents are the primary amplifying host. TBE can also be acquired by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products (e.g., milk and cheese) from infected goats, sheep, or cows. TBEV transmission has been infrequently reported during laboratory exposure and slaughtering of viremic animals, and direct person-to-person transmission, through blood transfusion and breastfeeding. (CDC; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/tickborne-encephalitis).

The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged over 50 years. It is curious that no vaccination of people resident in or visiting the areas of high tick abundance is mentioned. - Mod.TY

Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease or LD) is the commonest human tick-borne infectious disease in the northern hemisphere, occurring predominately in temperate regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. Of the more than 20 _Borrelia burgdorferi_ sensu lato (Bbsl) complex genospecies, only a few (for example, _B. afzelii_, _B. garinii_, and _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto) are human pathogens: _B. burgdorferi_ sensu stricto (Bbss) is the predominant cause of LD in North America; Bbss also occurs in Europe, but is less prevalent than _B. garinii_ or _B. afzelii_, the 2 major European pathogenic genospecies.

The vectors of Bbsl, which feed on both humans and reservoir species are 4 species of hard-bodied _Ixodes_ ticks: _I. scapularis_ is the main vector of Bbsl for humans in the eastern half of the US; _I. pacificus_, in the far-western US; _I. ricinus_, in Europe; and _I. persulcatus_, in Asia. The Central European region (Austria, Czech Republic, southern Germany, Switzerland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) has been reported to have the highest _Borrelia_ infection rates in _I. ricinus_ ticks (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1287732/); in Switzerland, 13.6 to 49% of ticks were infected. Of positive ticks in the Austria/Switzerland region, 25% were infected with _B. afzelii_, 44% with _B. garinii_, and 25% with Bbss. The infection rate in adult ticks (18.6%) was higher than in nymphs (10.1%).

The clinical manifestations of LD also vary by geographical location. For example, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and neuroborreliosis are commoner in Europe, whereas arthritis appears to be prevalent in the United States. Lyme neuroborreliosis is multifaceted, causing symptoms as a result of central and/or peripheral nervous system involvement; LD can cause meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, peripheral neuropathy, and/or encephalopathy.

Individual hard-bodied ixodes ticks can be infected with more than one genospecies of Bbsl complex, as well as multiple other pathogens, including _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the cause of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), _Babesia microti_, the cause of babesiosis, _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the cause of a relapsing fever-like illness, and tick-borne encephalitis virus or TBEV, the cause of tickborne encephalitis (TBE). It is, therefore, possible that co-infections with 2 or more of these tick-borne pathogens may occur. - Mod.ML
