North American bat death toll exceeds 5.5 million from white nose syndrome
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On the verge of another season of winter hibernating bat surveys, US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists and partners estimate that at least 5.7 million to 6.7 million bats have now died from white nose syndrome. Biologists expect the disease to continue to spread.

White nose syndrome (WNS) is decimating bat populations across eastern North America, with mortality rates reaching up to 100 per cent at many sites. First documented in New York in 2006, the disease has spread quickly into 16 states and 4 Canadian provinces. Bats with WNS exhibit unusual behavior during cold winter months, including flying outside during the day and clustering near the entrances of caves and mines where they hibernate. Bats have been found sick and dying in unprecedented numbers near these hibernacula.

"This startling new information illustrates the severity of the threat that white nose syndrome poses for bats, as well as the scope of the problem facing our nation. Bats provide tremendous value to the US economy as natural pest control for American farms and forests every year, while playing an essential role in helping to control insects that can spread disease to people," said Fish and Wildlife Service Director Dan Ashe. "We are working closely with our partners to understand the spread of this deadly disease and minimize its impacts to affected bat species."

Estimating the total number of bat deaths has been a difficult challenge for biologists. Although consistent population counts for federally listed endangered bats, like the Indiana bat, have been a priority for state and federal biologists, establishing population counts of once "common" bat species, like little brown bats, was historically not the primary focus of seasonal bat population counts.

"White nose syndrome has spread quickly through bat populations in eastern North America, and has caused significant mortality in many colonies," said national WNS coordinator, Dr Jeremy Coleman, "Many bats were lost before we were able to establish pre-white nose syndrome population estimates."

More than 140 partners, including tribal, state and federal biologists, and bat researchers convened in Carlisle, Pennsylvania for the 2012 Northeast Bat Working Group (NEBWG) meeting last week [week of 9 Jan 2012] to discuss challenges facing bat research, management, and conservation. Coordinating with wildlife officials in Canada, the group discussed population-level impacts to hibernating bats and developed the estimate of bats lost to WNS.

In addition to the lack of population data for many bat species, there has also been a lack of consistency in how bat population data was reported among agencies. As part of the May 2011 national WNS response plan, which was developed by the Service in partnership with a team of federal, state, tribal, and NGO scientists, agencies are addressing this by establishing methods for consistent data collection.

The National Plan for Assisting States, Federal Agencies and Tribes in Managing White Nose Syndrome in Bats provides a framework for the coordination and management of the national WNS investigation response, and the Service leads an extensive network of partners in implementing the plan.

The Service serves as the primary resource for up-to-date information and recommendations for all partners, such as important decontamination protocols for cave researchers and visitors and a cave access advisory that requests a voluntary moratorium on activities in caves in affected states to minimize the potential spread of WNS.

In addition to developing science-based protocols and guidance for land management agencies and other partners to minimize the spread of WNS, the Service has funded numerous research projects to support and assess management recommendations and improve our basic understanding of the dynamics of the disease.

The mission of the US Fish and Wildlife Service is working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. We are both a leader and trusted partner in fish and wildlife conservation, known for our scientific excellence, stewardship of lands and natural resources, dedicated professionals, and commitment to public service.

[2] News report
Date: Tue 17 Jan 2012

http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nearly-7-million-bats-may-have-died-from-white-nose-fungus-officials-say/2012/01/17/gIQAyixH6P_story.html


More than 5 years since the deadly white nose fungus was first detected in a New York cave where bats hibernate, up to 6.7 million of the animals are estimated to have died in 16 states and Canada, the US Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday [17 Jan 2012].

The estimate, drawn from surveys by wildlife officials mostly in Northeastern states where the disease thrives, confirmed the worst fears of biologists who have been counting dead bats covered in the powdery fungus in mines and caves every winter and worrying whether the little brown bat, the northern long-eared bat, and the tricolored bat will survive.

"We're watching a potential extinction event on the order of what we experienced with bison and passenger pigeons for this group of mammals," said Mylea Bayless, conservation programs manager for Bat Conservation International in Austin, Texas.

"The difference is we may be seeing the regional extinction of multiple species," Bayless said. "Unlike some of the extinction events or population depletion events we've seen in the past, we're looking at a whole group of animals here, not just one species. We don't know what that means, but it could be catastrophic."

Bats are a top nocturnal predator, picking off night-flying insects that feed on agricultural crops and forests. A reproductive female consumes her weight in bugs each night. In a single summer, a colony of 150 brown bats can eat enough adult cucumber beetles to prevent the laying of eggs that result in 33 million rootworm larvae, according to a study cited by Bat Conservation International.

White nose syndrome is caused by an aggressive fungus called _Geomyces destructans_ that eats through the skin and membranes of bats. It was first detected at Howes Cave near Albany, New York, in 2006.

Since then, biologists in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Vermont, Indiana, and other states have returned to caves and mines during the annual winter hibernation of bats and reported alarming numbers of fresh dead to wildlife and gaming agencies.

Tuesday's estimate of 5.7 million to 6.7 million dead bats dwarfed the previous count of slightly more than a million in 2009. The estimate was derived from winter trips to mines and caves through December 2011. Clustered as high as 30 feet above the floor, the bats are difficult to see, so digital images are captured and studied, said Jeremy Coleman, national white nose syndrome coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service.

"They ... basically count the noses," Coleman said. Otherwise "you look at a big brown smudge of bats. Indiana bats can have 300 in a square foot. You can get a much more accurate count with digital imagery," he said.

The declining population found in the winter counts was supported by summer counts, where bats are tracked to areas where they feed and roost.

The bats being wiped out by white nose syndrome are usually long-lived, up to 20 years. Mates produce a pup per year. They usually hibernate in the same places year to year, and they return to the same place to feed.

Biologists said the bats' decline could begin to affect the general public if their disappearance results in swarms of the insects they feed on, and higher food prices if food crops are invaded, biologists said.

A paper published last year [2011] in the journal Science, relying on the lower mortality rate projected in 2009, estimated that 1320 metric tons of insect pests were not eaten because of the decline in bats.

The paper products industry could also be hard hit if pests such as the emerald ash borer proliferate in the absence of bats. Loggers in states such as Vermont "ought to be concerned, but I don't think the word has really gotten out to these folks," said Mollie Matteson, a conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity in Richmond, Vermont.

"It certainly behooves people concerned about the health of forests -- loggers or ecologists -- to pay attention," Matteson said. "But it's hard to make a direct connection between 7 million bats dead and what happens to forest pests."

A recent report said bat colonies found in Vermont and Pennsylvania were an indication that some are managing to survive the fungus. But those data are inconclusive, and hopes based on the report might be misplaced, Coleman said.

In Pennsylvania, where the mortality rate of the most common bats is nearly 100 per cent, farmers and homeowners are showing concern, said Greg Turner, an endangered-mammals specialist for the Pennsylvania Game Commission. With 95 per cent mortality, there's little hope that the little brown bats will survive in the state, but Turner isn't giving up on saving them. "I'm going to plug forward all the way to the bitter end, if there is a bitter end. Hopefully, there won't be," he said.

[While both articles are long, they take a little different approach to arriving at some staggering and impressive numbers. And to be counting that many noses is even more staggering and I wonder how they verify the accuracy? How much is a calculated estimate? Are these kind of published numbers designed to gain interest for research grants to solve the problem? The numbers cited in both articles are impressive, staggering, and massive.

But I don't think anyone would argue the issue that this disease has clearly been devastating to some bat populations and is of concern to all. - Mod.TG
