The number of deaths from the cholera epidemic afflicting Haiti since
mid-October 2010 has risen to 1721, health officials said Mon 29 Nov
2010. In all, 75 888 people have been treated for the disease, of
whom 33 485 were hospitalized, though 32 283 of them recovered and
were sent home.

Cholera has killed 760 people in the northern province of Artibonite,
the hardest hit by the scourge. Following that province is Nord, with
290 deaths; Ouest with 285 including 162 in the Haitian capital;
Plateau Central with 177; and Nord-Ouest province with 164 fatalities.

Only one of Haiti's 10 provinces, Nippes, has not had a single cholera death.

[2] Haiti (Sud province)

The situation in the front of the cholera epidemic in the Sud
province and particularly in the town of Les Cayes, is extremely
worrying. Health services are totally overwhelmed while the number of
cases continues to increase and no major medical aid agency is
present in the area.

The agglomeration of Les Cayes has a combined population of over 320
000 inhabitants. The city is approximately the size of Cap Haitien.
Urban areas are densely populated. The poorest populations live near
river mouths, with no sanitation system. With its canals and open
drains much of the city center located in flood zones, Les Cayes
presents high risks of contamination.

The number of people infected in the Southern Province, although it
is less than the number of cases recorded in Port au Prince (note
that the government refuses to reveal the true assessment of PAP and
Metropolitan area since 24 Nov 2010), continues to increase. Until
now, throughout the department, 12 zone of infection, including 5
located in the city have been identified. Official figures show 160
cases treated, but they are largely underestimated.

An Orlando-area woman who recently moved from Haiti was treated for
cholera and has recovered. Orange County Health Department spokesman
Dain Weister on Monday [29 Nov 2010] wouldn't say how old the woman
is because of patient confidentiality. But he says she got sick
shortly after moving to the Orlando area.

The woman was treated by a doctor who gave her antibiotics. None of
her close contacts have gotten sick.

There has been at least one other confirmed case in Florida of the
disease caused by a bacterial infection of the intestine. That
Collier County case also has been linked to an outbreak in Haiti.

Doctors are trying to determine whether an American Airlines
passenger who became ill last Friday [26 Nov 2010] on a flight from
the Dominican Republic to Miami had cholera.

The health minister of the Dominican Republic announced the country's
7th case of cholera here on Sun 28 Nov 2010. Bautista Rojas Gomez,
who was once a doctor, said that a 5-year-old girl caught the disease
in Santo Domingo province and that she was the cousin of the 6th
case, whose infection was announced on 27 Nov 2010.

The minister said that Dominican doctors would stage a 2nd
intervention in "Little Haiti," a Santo Domingo slum that hosts
thousands of Haitians. "We issued them a warning to raise hygiene
standards when preparing food and it was ignored," Rojas said.

So far, all the cases reported were of people living in Rio Ozama,
where people are living in extreme poverty and without appropriate sanitation.
