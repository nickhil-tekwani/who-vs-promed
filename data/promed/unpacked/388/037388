A blue-ear disease outbreak has killed 182 of 262 infected pigs at a
farm in northern China's Shanxi Province, Xinhua news agency reported
today [31 Jul 2007]. The epidemic has been controlled by the local
government, according to the animal disease control and prevention
headquarters of Shanxi.
The pig farm in Liulin County in Luliang City had 355 total pigs
before the outbreak, Xinhua said.
Pork prices in China surged 74.6 percent in June from a year earlier
after a nationwide outbreak of the deadly blue-ear disease.
By 22 July 2007, 25 provinces had reported the deadly disease. Thus
far, the disease has killed 45 546 pigs, 27.58 percent of the total
infected. Another 42 728 were slaughtered.
The highly contagious disease, also known as porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome, often causes miscarriage and other reproductive
problems in pigs. The ministry has promised to complete a mass
immunization of pigs as early as possible because high temperatures
and humidity can help spread blue-ear disease.
It required veterinary departments to stay on high alert for the
disease and immediately report suspect cases. A total of 10.8 million
yuan (USD 1.43 million) has been allocated by the ministry to
strengthen inspections in outbreak areas, an earlier report said.
The elimination of the disease has become a top priority as it can
dispel the fears of breeders and spur them to raise more pigs, which
may lead to a drop in pork prices. A total of 30 special teams have
been dispatched to work with 60 pig-production bases to safeguard
animal supplies and stabilize soaring pork prices.

The Provincial Command Post for the Prevention of Major Animal
Epidemic Diseases has issued a notice. The notice states that
circumstances [facing] Highly Pathogenic Pig Blue Ear Disease
prevention and control have been extremely severe nationally. Highly
Pathogenic Pig Blue Ear Disease has occurred in a total of 26
provinces nationally. At present, only the 5 provinces of Sichuan,
Beijing, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Tibet have not had occurrences.

[Subscribers may have been puzzled by the fact that an epizootic,
recently affecting pigs in Viet Nam, is titled "PORCINE REPRODUCTIVE
& RESPIRATORY SYNDROME - VIET NAM" while a seemingly similar syndrome
in China is titled "UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, PORCINE - CHINA". The
background to this dissimilarity in the titling is simple: reporting.
The porcine epizootic in China allegedly started in July/August 2006.
the Chinese authorities have sent, until now, 2 relevant
notifications to the OIE. In the 1st one, submitted on 14 Sep 2006,
(see 20060924.2732), they informed about a syndrome they titled "pig
high fever disease" which was recorded in 6 provinces. Based upon
epidemiological investigation and laboratory testing of 582 samples
of pathogenic material, they concluded that the disease was "closely
related to the mixed infection of classical swine fever, porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome and porcine circovirus".
In their 2nd (and, so far, last) notification, submitted 9 May 2007
(see 20070512.1517), they informed about an outbreak of sub-clinical
infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
which had started on 23 Apr 2007 in the province Guangdong. It
involved the village Laosi, affecting 2981 susceptible fattening pigs
reared in backyards and small-scale farms, of which 1640 were
clinically affected, 331 died and 367 were destroyed. They
concluded:" Based on the experience of the similar epidemic occurred
in 2006 in China.... this case is probably caused by highly
pathogenic PRRS virus. The laboratory diagnosis is ongoing".
In the absence of officially notified definite diagnosis and final
laboratory results, ProMED-mail related to the epizootic in China as
"Undiagnosed", although media-derived information, and a scientific
paper published recently, strongly indicate that PRRS virus is the
main component of the syndrome in both countries, namely China and
Viet Nam. According to the same sources, the epizootic has already
spread into 26 out of China's 33 provinces.
The outbreak in Viet Nam was initially notified to the OIE on 10 Apr
2007, informing about 6 outbreaks in 3 provinces, which had started
on 23 Mar 2007and, according to laboratory tests, were caused by PRRS
virus. This initial notification was followed by 2 follow-up reports,
submitted to the OIE on 19 Apr 2007 and 1 Aug 2007, with information
on (respectively) 7 and 31 additional outbreaks, all caused by the
PRRS virus.
Submission of official information from China, pertaining to the
affected provinces , confirming the etiology of the large-scale
porcine epizootic and providing epidemiological data, will be helpful
in clarifying the issue and towards harmonising the titles.
