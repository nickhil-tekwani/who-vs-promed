The Director General of Health in Sulaymaniyah revealed that 2000 cases of diarrhea and vomiting were recorded in the hospitals in Sulaymaniyah city [Iraqi Kurdistan] in one week, and they have taken a number of measures to control the outbreak.

Dr Miran Mohammed, the Director General of Health in Sulaymaniyah, informed Bas News that "according to the data and information received from Sulaymaniyah city hospitals, 2000 cases of diarrhea and vomiting were recorded during one week only. In comparison with the previous week, the cases have increased 4-fold."

We also decided to prohibit selling and distributing water in tankers that are not specified for drinking water and when the source of water is doubtful."
