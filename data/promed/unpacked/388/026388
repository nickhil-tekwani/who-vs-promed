Japan's agriculture ministry said Friday [13 Sep 2019] that [classical] swine fever [CSF] infections have occurred at a pig farm in the city of Chichibu, Saitama Prefecture, part of the country's Kanto eastern region, which also includes Tokyo.

It is the 1st time that a CSF fever case has been confirmed in Kanto since the 1st outbreak of the infectious disease in the country in 26 years was detected in September [2018], in the central prefecture of Gifu.

The latest outbreak marked the 41st case of swine fever since the confirmation of the Gifu case.

After some of pigs shipped from the Chichibu farm to a meat-processing facility in Yamanashi Prefecture, southwest of Saitama, died or showed abnormal symptoms [see item 2 below], the central government and the Yamanashi prefectural government conducted a test on the pigs for possible swine fever infection, according to officials of the ministry.

Infections were confirmed Friday [13 Sep 2019], with the test showing positive results, the officials said. The Saitama prefectural government also confirmed the outbreak through its on-site inspection of the farm.

[2] 1st CSF outbreak, Yamanashi ex Saitama, domestic swine, slaughterhouse

A suspected [but see comment] case of [classical] swine fever [CSF] has been found in Yamanashi Prefecture, west of Tokyo, prefectural officials said Friday [13 Sep 2019].

If the infection is confirmed through a state test, it will be the 1st swine fever case in Yamanashi since Japan had its 1st swine fever outbreak in 26 years in the central prefecture of Gifu in September last year [2018].

The test result is expected to be announced Friday [confirmed, see comment].

The suspected case was reported at Yamanashi Meat Logistics Center Co., a slaughterhouse based in the city of Fuefuki. According to the prefectural officials, the state test is being conducted for 4 pigs bought into the company on Wednesday [11 Sep 2019].

[For the location of Chichibu within the Saitama prefecture, go to https://tinyurl.com/y24au5hy (zoom in). The source of infection was suspected to be wild boars. For the location of the secondary infection in a slaughterhouse, Fuefuki within the Yamanashi prefecture, please go to https://tinyurl.com/y6saupnb.

The Yamanashi prefecture borders Saitama on the southwest; the introduction of infected pigs from a previously uninfected prefecture into a slaughterhouse in another previously uninfected prefecture demonstrates the complex CSF situation in Japan.

Since the start of the event, 3 Sep 2018, and as of 18 Aug 2019 (last available follow-up report), a total of 961 outbreaks have been reported from Japan (the 2 new outbreaks are yet to be reported). Links to all 35 OIE reports, and an interactive map presenting the accumulated outbreaks, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=27871 (zoom in to the required resolution).

A press release dated Fri 13 Sep 2019 by Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (in Japanese) included a confirmation of the secondary outbreak in the slaughterhouse of Fuefuki, Yamanashi, available at http://www.maff.go.jp/j/press/syouan/douei/190913_7.html. (thanks to Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka).

The continuing spread of CSF in Japan, in wild boar and domestic pigs, more than a year after its introduction (most probably, from mainland China), and in spite of the stamping out policy, is a matter for concern.

The CSF event in Japan may be viewed as a drill for an unfortunate future introduction of African swine fever (ASF) virus, most likely by contaminated pork products, and indicative of the possible role of wild boar in its epidemiology. Swill is allowed to be fed to swine in Japan only after its heat treatment. Hopefully this requirement is being adhered to. Japan has applied severe measures in air and seaports to prevent the ASF virus -- currently circulating throughout China, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and, most recently, also the Philippines -- from being introduced by passengers. A recent incident demonstrating this situation was reported in 20190807.6611268.

Since March 2019, oral vaccination of wild boars, which have become the CSF virus reservoir in Japan, is being applied in affected areas. Vaccination of domestic pigs is prohibited. Unfortunately, no vaccine is yet available against ASF. - Mod.AS
