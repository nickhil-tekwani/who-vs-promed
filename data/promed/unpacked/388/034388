An infectious-disease nightmare is unfolding: a new gene that can
turn many types of bacteria into superbugs resistant to nearly all
antibiotics has sickened people in 3 states and is popping up all
over the world, health officials reported Mon 13 Sep 2010.

The USA cases and 2 others in Canada all involve people who had
recently received medical care in India, where the problem is
widespread. A British medical journal revealed the risk in August
2010 in an article describing dozens of cases in Britain in people
who had gone to India for medical procedures.

How many deaths the gene may have caused is unknown; there is no
central tracking of such cases. So far, the gene has mostly been
found in bacteria that cause gut or urinary infections.

Scientists have long feared this, a very adaptable gene that hitches
onto many types of common germs and confers broad drug resistance.
"It's a great concern," because drug resistance has been rising and
few new antibiotics are in development, said Dr M Lindsay Grayson,
director of infectious diseases at the University of Melbourne in
Australia. "It's just a matter of time" until the gene spreads more
widely person-to-person, he said.

The American cases occurred in 2010 in people from California,
Massachusetts, and Illinois, said Brandi Limbago, a lab chief at the
CDC. 3 different bacteria were involved, and different mechanisms let
the gene become part of them. "We want physicians to look for it,"
especially in patients who have traveled recently to India or
Pakistan, she said.

The gene can spread hand-to-mouth, which makes good hygiene very
important. It's also why health officials are so concerned about
where the threat is coming from, said Dr Patrice Nordmann, a
microbiology professor at South-Paris Medical School. India is an
overpopulated country that overuses antibiotics and has widespread
diarrheal disease and many people without clean water. "The
ingredients are there" for widespread transmission, he said. "It's
going to spread by plane all over the world."

The American patients were not related. The California woman needed
hospital care after being in a car accident in India. The Illinois
man had pre-existing medical problems and a urinary catheter, and is
thought to have contracted an infection with the gene while traveling
in India. The case from Massachusetts involved a woman from India who
had surgery and chemotherapy for cancer there and then traveled to
the USA.

Lab tests showed their germs were not killed by the types of drugs
normally used to treat drug-resistant infections, including "the
last-resort class of antibiotics that physicians go to," Limbago
said. She did not know how the 3 patients were treated, but all
survived.

Doctors have tried treating some of these cases with combinations of
antibiotics, hoping that will be more effective than individual ones
are. Some have resorted to using polymyxins, antibiotics used in the
1950s and '60s that were unpopular because they can harm the kidneys.

The 2 Canadian cases were treated with a combination of antibiotics,
said Dr Johann Pitout of the University of Calgary in Alberta,
Canada. One case was in Alberta, the other in British Columbia. Both
patients had medical emergencies while traveling in India. They
developed urinary infections that were discovered to have the
resistance gene once they returned home to Canada, Pitout said.

The CDC advises any hospitals that find such cases to put the patient
in medical isolation, check the patient's close contacts for possible
infection, and look for more infections in the hospital. Any case
"should raise an alarm," Limbago said.

[There is every reason to assume that once introduced into a country
these organisms will persist by hospital-associated spread to other
patients. The only ways of preventing this spread are adequate
barrier protection, manifest primarily by aggressive hand washing,
and by rational use of antimicrobials to minimize the niche for these
pathogens.

Japan has confirmed another 5 cases of infection with
_Acinetobacter_, an antibiotic-resistant bacterium, carrying what is
formally know as "New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 enzyme (NDM-1)".

The cases from Teikyo University Hospital have brought the total
number of people infected with the bug to 58 in the country. Of the
58 people, 32 have died, including 9 whose deaths were likely caused
directly by the infection, the Xinhua news agency reports.

NDM-1 is a type of bacteria resistant to carbapenems, one of the
antibiotics of last resort for many bacterial infections. The bug is
formally named after New Delhi, as it was reportedly discovered in
the Indian capital. According to reports, it has spread to Britain
and the USA through travelers who had surgery in India.
