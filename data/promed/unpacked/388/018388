The 1st case of West Nile virus (WNV) has been confirmed in a Washington horse in 2018. The Washington State Department of Agriculture reported that a 5-year-old Quarter Horse from Grant County has tested positive for WNV, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) said 13 Aug 2018. "The horse may have had one vaccination and has a neurological deficit in the right rear leg," the EDCC said. "The prognosis at this time appears to be favorable and the horse is receiving supportive care."

WNV is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it;" occasional drowsiness; propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

WNV has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30% to 40%.

Studies have shown that vaccines are a very effective eastern equine encephalitis [another mosquito-borne virus] prevention tool. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by removing stagnant water sources; dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly; keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

Blue Sky Veterinary Clinic said it found West Nile virus (WNV) in a horse near Medicine Hat [AB, Canada]. A post on the organization's Facebook page indicates there have been other cases in the Brooks and Jenner area.

August is the prime month for WNV to appear. WNV is a mosquito-borne virus carried by a certain type of mosquito, the _Culex tarsalis_. WNV can cause swelling and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord in horses, birds and humans. It was first detected in Alberta in 2003.

According to Alberta Agriculture, most horses bitten by an infected mosquito will not develop clinical disease, as they are able to fight off the virus. However, around 35% of those that do develop signs may die or must be euthanized because of complications.

For those that do get sick, they can exhibit several signs: "listlessness, a change in demeanour becoming less active and isolated, reduced appetite, inability to swallow, drooping lips, muscle twitching, a lack of co-ordination, weakness in the limbs, partial paralysis or an inability to get up," noted the agriculture and forestry website. "A fever is not always present."

Officials say infected horses should be examined by a veterinarian because the signs are like those caused by western equine encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis and rabies. Some horses recovering from WNV may suffer from permanent neurological issues.

Last year [2017] there were 7 cases of WNV confirmed in humans in Alberta. Alberta Health Services (AHS) said of the 7 cases, 4 of those were in the south health zone that stretches from Medicine Hat to Lethbridge. No human cases have been reported so far this year [2018], but AHS says August is the peak season for cases of WNV to appear.

"There are some people who start feeling like a viral illness because it is a virus, you get a fever, headaches, body aches that usually happens within a couple days to a couple weeks of getting bitten," said Dr. Lizette Elumir, medical officer of health. "On the rare occasion it can turn into a neurological disease or a serious disease."

Although WNV can have serious and even deadly consequences, Dr. Elumir said many people may not even realize they have contracted it. "Whether we have cases or not, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be protecting ourselves," she explained. "Keep in mind a lot of West Nile is asymptomatic, so if you do end up getting West Nile virus, a large number, like 80% of them, you have no symptoms at all."

There is a vaccine for horses to help prevent them from contracting WNV, along with other equine diseases stemming from mosquito bites, but there is no such vaccine for people. AHS says people should protect themselves against the disease by using insect repellent and wearing protective clothing to prevent bug bites.

[What a pity horses die of a disease when there is a very effective vaccine. There are effective sprays specifically designed to control mosquitoes on horses.

Mosquitoes can be in almost any place. There is likely no place safe from this disease because of mosquitoes. Protect yourself from mosquitoes with repellant, wearing long sleeves and avoiding dawn and dusk. Provide your animals with the same thoughtful protection -- a vaccine and mosquito repellant -- and eliminate mosquito breeding places. - Mod.TG
