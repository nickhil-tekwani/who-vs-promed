The Beni Suef health department has declared a state of emergency
after claiming to have discovered the governorate's 1st case of
malaria. However, Egypt's Health ministry has denied the reports,
stressing that the country is free of the disease and that it would
have announced any cases that had been discovered.

Assistant Health Minister Nasr al-Sayyid denied the supposed discovery
of malaria in Beni Suef or any other governorates.

Magdy Hazin, head of preventive medicine at the Beni Suef health
department, said that a 62-year-old from Beba has been hospitalized at
the Fever Hospital in Beni Suef after testing positive for malaria.
Hazin said the patient has started to respond to medication and that
samples have been taken from more than 200 of the patient's relatives
and sent to Cairo for analysis.

Hazin attributed the infection to the presence of mosquitoes and
garbage in the area. But he ruled out drinking water as a reason for
the man's illness, citing samples taken from the water station near
Beba.

Agents from the health department sprayed the village's entrances and
exits with pesticides to prevent the infection from spreading to
neighboring villages.

[Since 1998, no indigenous malaria cases were registered by the
Malaria Control Programme throughout the whole country. Without a
reservoir, it is difficult to explain a single case except as imported
or transmitted from an imported case.

Malaria diagnosis relies on microscopy of thick blood films, and it is
not clear whether the present case has been confirmed or not. Many
infections can easily be confused with malaria.

Malaria in Egypt, background information from the WHO
http://www.emro.who.int/rbm/CountryProfiles-egy.htm:

The malaria caseload was reduced from about 85 000 cases in 1960 to
5400 cases in 1970, with a preponderance of _P. vivax_ cases. In 1989
and in 1994-95, 2 outbreaks of malaria (198 and 808 cases,
respectively) occurred, caused almost exclusively by _P. falciparum_
in Fayoum governorate.

After application of intensive control measures, only 4 indigenous
cases (all _P. falciparum_) were reported in 1997. A formal report
from MOH indicates that only 23 cases occurred in 2005, and all were
imported from Sierra Leone and Sudan.

In the past, local vectors assured a moderate level of endemicity of
malaria all over the Nile Valley, Delta and oases. But Egypt also knew
catastrophic epidemics due to the importation of _A. arabiensis_ from
Sudan (the epidemic in Upper Egypt in 1942-1943 that resulted in up to
180 000 deaths).

One of the main concerns of the National Malaria Control Programme is
to prevent the proliferation of _Anopheles arabiensis_ mosquitoes from
Sudan into the Egyptian territory along the shores of Lake Nasser,
which was formed as a result of the completion of the Aswan High Dam
in 1970.
