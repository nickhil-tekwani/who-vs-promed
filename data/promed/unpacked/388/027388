Bulgarian veterinary authorities reported on Monday [8 Nov 2021] a new outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] at an industrial farm that has a total of 180 pigs in the southern village of Radinovo.

The outbreak is the 2nd at an industrial farm in a Balkan country this year [2021], the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency said in a statement [see ProMED post 20210821.8612710].

All the pigs at the farm will be culled, the agency said, and a 3 km [1.9 mi] quarantine zone set up around it to stop the spread of the disease, which is incurable in pigs but harmless to humans.

In August [2021], the agency had to cull some 13 000 pigs at an industrial farm in the central village of Apriltsi after an ASF outbreak. The agency has reported 5 outbreaks of the disease in backyard farms in 2021.
