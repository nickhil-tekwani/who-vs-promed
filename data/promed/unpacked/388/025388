Abstract
---------
In November 2021, a clonal outbreak of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ of novel sequence type ST3875 was detected in 3 patients who died of bloodstream infections in one hospital. By 25 Apr 2022, the outbreak included 339 cases from 38 hospitals across Norway. Initial hospital reports indicate _Pseudomonas_ infection as the main contributing cause in 7 deaths. In March 2022, the outbreak strain was identified in non-sterile pre-moistened disposable washcloths, used to clean patients, from 3 lots from the same international manufacturer.

[This multi-regional, nosocomial outbreak of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections in Norway initially involved 29 patients, including at least 3 deaths from _P. aeruginosa_ sepsis, when first posted by ProMED in January 2022 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa - Norway: nosocomial, fatal, WGS, RFI 20220127.8701101). Now the outbreak is reported to have involved 38 Norwegian hospitals and a total of 339 cases with _Pseudomonas_ infection contributing to the death of at least 7 deaths; about 80% of the 339 patients were infected with the outbreak strain (20% with bloodstream infection), and 20% were colonized by the outbreak strain.

In mid-March 2022, after systematic testing of several hundred different products that were used in hospital wards, _P. aeruginosa_ was detected in disposable, pre-moistened washcloths, eventually being found in 4 lots produced on multiple dates. Molecular testing confirmed that this _P. aeruginosa_ was the same as the outbreak strain ST3875. After use of these washcloths was stopped in Norwegian hospitals, the number of new cases rapidly declined.

The use of this product is said to be common but often not documented in patient records. According to the manufacturer's website, this product is said to be used in healthcare worldwide. Consequently, these contaminated pre-moistened washcloths may be contributing to nosocomial infections elsewhere. The washcloth is classified as a non-sterile cosmetic product, but as such, must not be contaminated with _P. aeruginosa_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Escherichia coli_, and _Candida albicans_, according to European Commission guidelines. - Mod.ML
