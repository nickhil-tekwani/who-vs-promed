Comment on Echinococcosis, foxes - France 20071222.4114
-------------------------------------------------------
I have some comments on this message posted 22 Dec 2007 (see
reference). There is a confusion in the message between 2 related
_Echinococcus_ species both present in France: _E. granulosus_
(adults in dogs and larval hydatid cysts in sheep, cattle, horses, or
accidentally, in humans) and _E. multilocularis_ (adults in foxes and
larvae in rodents or accidentally, in humans). This confusion between
these 2 parasites, with different clinical consequences in humans,
has led to the following mistakes in the message:
- "hydatid cysts" mentioned in the title (larval form of _E.
granulosus_) cannot be found in foxes but only in liver, spleen, and
other organs of sheep, cattle....
- foxes or dogs can acquire the disease by ingestion of "infected
meat" but not humans...
- "meat" is not an appropriate word as larvae are found, most of the
time, in the liver, lungs, spleen, and very infrequently in muscles
- adults are found in the gut of canids and not in those of moose,
sheep, and cattle,
- infective eggs are only shed by canids and never by the other
infected animals (such as humans).
Nevertheless, in France, the range of foxes infected by _E.
multilocularis_ is increasing: infected foxes are now found in the
suburbs of Paris and even in Normandy (for details see map at
<http://www.ententeragezoonoses.com/NoteSynthese/NS6/NS6.pdf>).
Consumers should be aware of that risk after consumption of homegrown
vegetables and wild berries (such as, strawberries, raspberries, and
blueberries). Sufficient cooking (65 deg C - 149 deg F) is an
efficient preventive method.
