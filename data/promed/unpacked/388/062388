Cattle producers urged to watch for anaplasmosis
------------------------------------------------
A seasonal spike in the deadly cattle disease, anaplasmosis, has been
reported in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa, and a Kansas State University
(K-state) veterinarian is encouraging producers to be vigilant in
monitoring their cattle.

"Producers need to watch for it," said K-State Research and Extension
veterinarian Larry Hollis. "It occurs almost exclusively in adult
cattle -- not calves. The most frequent observation is sudden death,
even though it actually takes a few days from the time signs 1st
appear until death occurs. If producers are not watching closely, it
will sneak up on them. There is a big difference between sudden death
and suddenly found dead." Early signs include white skin that appears
yellow and whites of the eyes that will also appear yellow, Hollis
said, and dairy cows will drop in lactation.

"Treatment with a long-acting oxytetracycline (LA-200 type products)
will usually stop further death losses within a week following
treatment," he added. "However, producers should be careful as the
simple exertion caused by driving cattle to or working them through
the chute may be enough to kill more severely affected ones. Most
producers who have been feeding chlortetracycline this summer (CTC or
Aureomycin) will not have the problem. CTC feeding should continue
until the end of fly season."

Anaplasmosis can be transmitted any time blood is transferred from
one animal to another by vaccination needles and such instruments as
ear taggers and tattoo equipment, as well as by blood-sucking insects
such as ticks and biting flies, he said. Producers should remember to
disinfect their needles and other potential blood-transferring
equipment between animals (except when giving modified live virus or
MLV vaccines). When using MLV vaccines producers should change
needles between every animal to prevent the disinfectant from killing
the [modified-live] virus [found in the vaccine].

Research and Extension, nor is criticism implied of any product not

[The _Anaplasma_ genus has recently been expanded to include species
transferred from the genus _Ehrlichia_, now named _Anaplasma
phagocytophilum_ (compiled from species previously known as
_Ehrlichia phagocytophila_, _E equi_, and human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis agent), _A bovis_ (previously _E bovis_), and _A platys_
(previously _E platys_), all of which invade blood cells other than
erythrocytes of their respective mammalian hosts. Bovine anaplasmosis
is of economic significance in the cattle industry.

Clinical bovine anaplasmosis is usually caused by _A marginale_.
Cattle are also infected with _A centrale_, which generally results
in mild disease. _A ovis_ may cause mild to severe disease in sheep,
deer, and goats.

Anaplasmosis is not contagious. Numerous species of tick vectors
(_Boophilus_, _Dermacentor_, _Rhipicephalus_, _Ixodes _, _Hyalomma_,
and _Ornithodoros_) can transmit _Anaplasma_ spp. Not all of these
are likely significant vectors in the field, and it has been shown
that strains of _A. marginale_ also co-evolve with particular tick
strains. _Boophilus_ spp are major vectors in Australia and Africa,
and _Dermacentor_ spp have been incriminated as the main vectors in
the USA.

After feeding on an infected animal, intrastadial or trans-stadial
transmission may occur. Transovarial transmission may also occur,
although this is rare, even in the single-host _Boophilus_ spp. A
replicative cycle occurs in the infected tick. Mechanical
transmission via biting dipterans occurs in some regions.
Transplacental transmission has been reported and is usually
associated with acute infection of the dam in the 2nd or 3rd
trimester of gestation. Anaplasmosis may also be spread through the
use of contaminated needles or dehorning or other surgical
instruments.

Affected animals have decrease in appetite, milk yield and stamina.
They have thin watery blood which may not transport oxygen
efficiently and lead to difficulty breathing as the animal is not be
properly oxygenated.

Diagnosis may be made on a geimsa-stained blood smear.

There is a strong correlation between age of cattle and severity of
disease. Calves are much more resistant to disease (although not
infection) than older cattle. This resistance is not due to colostral
antibody from immune dams. In endemic areas where cattle 1st become
infected with _A marginal_ early in life, losses due to anaplasmosis
are minimal. After recovery from the acute phase of infection, cattle
remain chronically infected carriers but are generally immune to
further clinical disease.

However, these chronically infected cattle may relapse to
anaplasmosis when immunosuppressed (e.g., by corticosteroids), when
infected with other pathogens, or after splenectomy. Carriers serve
as a reservoir for further transmission, which is likely why the
Canadians are terminating the animals. However with treatment this is
overcome. Serious losses occur when mature cattle with no previous
exposure are moved into endemic areas or when under endemically
unstable situations when transmission rates are insufficient to
ensure all cattle are infected before reaching the more susceptible
adult age.

Tetracycline antibiotics and imidocarb are currently used for
treatment. Cattle may be sterilized by treatment with these drugs and
remain immune to severe anaplasmosis subsequently for at least 8
months. Since there is treatment, that can eliminate the carrier
state, they why the deaths of the animals?

Prompt administration of tetracycline drugs (tetracycline,
chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, rolitetracycline, doxycycline,
minocycline) in the early stages of acute disease (e.g., PCV >15
percent) usually ensures survival. A commonly used treatment consists
of a single IM injection of long-acting oxytetracycline at a dosage
of 20 mg/kg. Blood transfusion to partially restore the PCV greatly
improves the survival rate of more severely affected cattle. The
carrier state may be eliminated by administration of a long-acting
oxytetracycline preparation (20 mg/kg, IM, at least 2 injections with
a 1-week interval). Withholding periods for tetracyclines apply in
most countries. Injection into the neck muscle rather than the rump
is preferred.

Imidocarb is also highly efficacious against _A marginale_ as a
single injection (as the dihydrochloride salt at 1.5 mg/kg, SC, or as
imidocarb dipropionate at 3.0 mg/kg). Elimination of the carrier
state requires the use of higher repeated doses of imidocarb (e.g., 5
mg/kg, IM or SC, 2 injections of the dihydrochloride salt 2 weeks
apart). Imidocarb is a suspected carcinogen with long withholding
periods and is not approved for use in the USA or Europe.
