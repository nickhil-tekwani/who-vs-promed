Outbreak of _Papaya ringspot virus_ in papaya orchards in St. Kitts
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Fruit tree production has become increasingly more important in the
agricultural industry of St. Kitts. This is because of an increasing
demand for local fruits resulting from an expanding local tourism
sector. Papayas (_Carica papaya_), along with bananas and mangoes,
are commonly grown to provide the sector with the 'Kittian fruit plate'.

Mosaic symptoms on leaves and ringspot blemishes on fruits were
observed on papaya trees in orchards at 2 locations along the
northwest coast of St. Kitts (Brimstone Hill and Fahies). Samples
were tested by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (DAS-ELISA) for _Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV). In addition,
crude sap extracts from affected leaf samples were mechanically
inoculated onto papaya seedlings. Symptoms typical of PRSV, including
vein clearing followed by mosaic development and leaf distortions,
were observed in the inoculated plants within 2 weeks. All original
samples and the indicator plants tested positive in DAS-ELISA.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PRSV was
positive with samples from both locations. The nucleotide sequences
of the 2 RT-PCR products were 99 percent identical and showed high
nucleotide similarities (90 to 97 percent) with PRSV isolates from
Jamaica, Cuba, Florida, and Brazil, and a lower similarity of 89
percent with an isolate from Puerto Rico.

This is the 1st confirmed report of PRSV in St. Kitts. Despite
eradication measures and destruction of the infected crop, the
pathogen has subsequently spread throughout the island, wiping out
approximately 90 percent of production.

[2] Papaya ringspot virus - Thailand: (Khon Kaen), spread

Like other areas where papaya is grown commercially, the northeastern
province of Khon Kaen faces an outbreak of papaya ringspot virus.

Wilai Prasartsri, head of the Khon Kaen-based Agricultural Research
and Development Office, advocates the study of GM [genetically
modified] papaya to fight the virus. Her office has conducted
research on GM papaya for years. A joint effort with researchers at
Cornell University in the USA bore fruit in 1997 as it came up with a
modified papaya cultivar that could fight the disease

According to her, the virus carried by many kinds of plant lice turns
papaya leaves yellow, leaves ring spots on papaya fruit, and halts
their growth. The papaya ringspot disease erupted in the Northeast in
1975 and then spread to the Central Plains, the East, and the South.
Up to 80 percent of papaya plantations nationwide were plagued with
the virus last year [2006], with the planting area reduced from more
than 162 000 rai (about 260 sq km/100 sq mi) previously to 55 000 rai
(about 88 sq km/34 sq mi).

[_Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV; genus _Potyvirus_) occurs as 2
strains: PRSV-P infects both papaya and cucurbits (such as, squash,
pumpkin, cucumber, and watermelon); PRSV-W infects cucurbits only.
Symptoms on papaya leaves are yellowing, vein-clearing, mottling, and
sometimes-severe blistering and leaf distortion. Fruit symptoms are
striking and consist of dark concentric rings and spots or C-shaped
markings. Vigour of trees, life span, and fruit set are usually
reduced depending on the age of the plant when infected. Fruit
quality, particularly flavour, is also adversely affected.

The virus is spread by many species of aphids and with infected
plants or seedlings. It does not survive in soil or dead plant
material. PRSV is not usually regarded as being seed-transmitted
although there is one report from the Philippines of transmission
through seed of a local papaya variety.

PRSV occurs in most countries where the crop is grown and is the
major limiting factor to production in many of these countries.

Disease management includes quarantine measures, limiting sources of
inoculum, vector control, and the use of resistant or tolerant
cultivars. A few tolerant papaya varieties are known, which develop
symptoms but can still provide useful yields when infected. Natural
resistance to PRSV does not exist in _Carica papaya_. Resistant
varieties are being developed both by traditional breeding techniques
using interspecific hybridisation with resistant _Carica_ species,
and by using genetic engineering techniques to insert the coat
protein gene from local PRSV strains. For example, in Hawaii
transgenic papayas now represent 3 quarters of the total crop.
Several Asian countries are currently developing transgenic papaya
varieties resistant to local viral strains.
