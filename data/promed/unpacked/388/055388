[This LPAI H5N9 outbreak is located in the same area where on 9 Dec 2016 France reported LPAI H5N1. Both subtypes have been reported as new strains of a listed disease in the country.

"H5N1 LPAI virus was detected in ducks in Pallanne. The samples were taken in the framework of the surveillance of the protection zone around the outbreak in Monlezun (H5N8), in a farm with 1000 ducks. All 1000 birds exposed were slaughtered. France put the country under "high risk" measures for avian influenza last week following the outbreak of the severe H5N8 virus".
