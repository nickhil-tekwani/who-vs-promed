re: posting 20061005.2857 Tuberculosis, bovine, badgers - UK
-----------------------------------------------
I read the posting and found some of the claims a bit difficult.
I am a consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC) with the Health
Protection Agency (HPA) in the UK. Part of my training was in Gloucester,
which has been a hot-spot for TB (both in cattle and badgers) for many
years. Indeed, one might say that the largely successful programs to
control TB in cattle after World War II failed in that area (or were never
successfully concluded). I recall a vet from the (now) State Veterinary
Service (SVS) office in Gloucester explaining that the major differences
between the TB they were seeing in badgers and in cattle were:
1) Cattle were captive and being checked regularly, with the result that
the reactors were being detected at an early stage of the disease and very
few had "open" lung lesions that are necessary for airborne transmission
(and none had udder lesions necessary for transmission through
unpasteurized milk);
2) Badgers were free ranging and not being checked, with the result that
the disease progressed in the badgers to the stage where an infected animal
was excreting (in various body secretions, excretions and fluids) vast
quantities of bacilli onto the ground/pasture, in their setts, etc;
3) As a consequence, an infected badger was the source for both other sett
mates (and other badgers in the area and other animals) and for cattle [A
badger sett is a deep burrow that they dig, share with other badgers, and
raise young. - Mod.MHJ]. The cattle picked up the germs as they grazed on
the infected pasture (and also inhaled germs from the pasture). Badgers
[and possibly other infected wild and domesticated animals: posting
20061009.2896 records "Although called bovine tuberculosis, the bacillus
has a broad host range, including cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs, badgers,
foxes, marsupials, rabbits, sheep, horses and deer. - Mod.LL] also possibly
raided stores of feedstuff and contaminated the feedstuff, increasing
transmission. In contrast, because most of the cattle were not "open"
cases, they were only very rarely transmitting the germ to other animals
(including man or badgers).
Clearly, there will be the occasional "open" TB case in cattle, but I must
say that, in the past 8 years I have been in my present post, I have only
seen one report from the SVS to me in which there have been macroscopic
lung lesions (as a proxy, not perfect, I agree, for "open" pulmonary TB)
and many hundreds where the skin testing has detected an earlier stage of
disease, principally retropharyngeal and mediastinal lymph nodes without
lung lesions or even no visible lesions.
The situation he was describing makes common -- and medical/epidemiological
-- sense at the time, though now at least partially contradicted by this
report.
Cattle movement around the UK -- the other thing highlighted in Dr
Woodroffe's report -- is an important factor. The effect of the change in
practice of the wholesale movement of animals from one end of the country
to the other in the last 20-30 years was clearly a major contributing
factor to the difference between the limited foot and mouth disease (FMD)
outbreak in the West Midlands in the 1960s and the massive UK outbreak a
few years ago. Movement of infected but not detected cattle will clearly
take the disease from one area to another. For example, I was informed of
one breakdown in my area in beef sucklers and had a discussion with the
farmer about the implications for human health. I asked whether these were
cattle he had bought in, answer "yes." When I asked where from, he said
"Devon, but the farmer I bought them from told me there is no TB in Devon!"
I tried not to give a hollow laugh. Farmers can be their own worst enemies,
but I have some sympathy for their situation: reversing the economic system
that makes it necessary, or at least profitable, to move cattle vast
distances is not something that will be easily achieved, if at all. They
are only following market forces, after all, and the market rules!
Your comments to the posting clearly documented the positive results of the
earlier trials of culling. However, you then seem to agree with the
assertion that badgers are being infected by cattle, rather than badgers
infecting each other (and possibly cattle) and ask "how else would the
latter [badgers] get infected otherwise?" Logically, there is a perfectly
reasonable scenario that endemic TB did, indeed, affect many species before
attempts at eradication in cattle; that the eradication efforts in cattle
were largely successful (except in the persisting foci in the south west of
England), especially where badger culling also took place; but that endemic
foci persisted in both cattle and wild animals (after all, they are not
available for testing to try to detect early stage disease); and spread has
continued both within the wild species (such as badgers, especially when
any efforts at control were suspended during the FMD outbreak) and back to
cattle, especially where the concentration of infected badgers has been
sufficiently great to widely contaminate pasture etc.
I wish there were a more humane way of controlling the disease in wild
animals, especially badgers, analogous to the way rabies has been/is being
controlled quite successfully by oral vaccination of foxes etc in large
parts of Europe. Until we have those control possibilities, it seems to me
that we must fall back on stamping out measures, or give up any control
efforts. The stamping out measures, regretfully, must include controlling
wild animals as well as culling infected cattle.
However, the reported conclusions of the report from Dr Woodroffe, that the
results clearly show "that there is substantial transmission of TB from
cattle to badgers", and "no other explanation fits the data [of an increase
in the prevalence of TB in badgers in areas that were left alone during the
FMD restrictions]" are not the only logical possibilities and I would
contend are not even the most likely explanations.
[There is a] growing concern, both among farmers and the general public,
about the continuing cattle TB problem in the UK. I get asked about this by
members of the public, especially in the farming and rural communities
being affected.

[My views on TB control are very traditional: aggressive cattle testing and
culling, but not at short intervals. This was the problem in Cornwall in
the early 1970s. They had so frequently tested their cows they were
desensitized and weren't reacting if infected. And it is clear, whatever
California says, that there must be badger culling but at rates >80 per
cent. Less just encourages population perturbation and churning. Clearly,
one of the covert problems was and potentially is the "rescuing" of sick
and healthy badgers and their release into new areas. This problem would
rear its head again if badger culling does not have popular support.
My comments on cows infecting badgers was that at some time it had to have
happened for the badgers to become infected. And I do agree with Roy's
comments on the bovine epidemiology. If the control program has fallen far
behind, it would significantly increase the probability of mycobacteria
shedding cows. We must assume that Defra has a dedicated vet epi-team
involved [but only indirectly, otherwise they would just be tired field
officers] with the testing and culling to identify circumstances when
testing and culling take longer than they should and why. While modellers
have their place, I believe in muddy boots. - Mod.MHJ]

My previous postings on the subject may have branded me as "pro-badger."
Nonetheless, I would point out that, in hindsight, there is some evidence
to show that the results of culling might have been predicted. Perusing
some of the recent literature, in particular --
Carpenter, Petra J, et al. Mating system of the Eurasian badger, Meles
meles, in a high-density population. Molecular Ecology 2005; 14: 273-84.
Woodroffe R, et al. Culling and cattle controls influence tuberculosis risk
for badgers. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2006; 103(40): 14713-7. Epub Oct 2, 2006.
-- one is brought to a hypothesis that territorial male badgers are
confined from wandering far a field by high populations of badgers (in the
Carpenter study, up to 25 adult badgers per square km). Territories are
smaller, and the number of co-specific contacts are reduced to nearest
neighbors. After a cull, male territories are allowed to expand, increasing
their geographical range and the number of non-neighbor badger contacts a
wandering male might encounter. Thus, culling increases the likelihood of
contact between healthy and infected badgers.
In examination of _Mycobacterium_ spp outbreaks in Canadian farmed elk,
there has been good evidence of spread among ruminants grazing on common
ground, possibly through the contamination of pasture by shedding bacteria
and the ingestion thereof with the contaminated plant material.
Lees, V, Wayne, et al. Bovine tuberculosis in elk (Cervus elaphus
manitobensis) near Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, from 1992 to
2002 Can Vet J 2003; 44(10): 830-1.
And early theories about the role of earthworms (apparently the main food
of English badgers) in "re-surfacing" and moving about of buried
Mycobacteria have found some support:
Fischer OA. Earthworms (Oligochaeta, Lumbricidae) and mycobacteria. Vet
Microbiol 2003; 91(4): 325-38.
Using the "retrospectoscope" for perspective, then, one might conclude that:
1) culling of badger populations might lead to increased badger-badger
transmission of Mycobacteria by releasing male badgers from the constraints
of densely packed territories;
2) culling of badger populations might contribute to a increase in
earthworm activity and subsequent vector-spread of mycobacteria in the soil;
3) grazing of infected pasture not only could increase infection rates
among cattle but could through shedding of mycobacteria contribute to
intensification of mycobacteria in the pasture.
4) There is a possibility that intense culling of the badger population
could lead to a population boom amongst earthworms and a consequent
outbreak of _Mycobacterium bovis_ in grazing cattle.
Perhaps the best approach for mycobacterium control is to leave pastures
fallow for several years, with frequent harrowing to expose infected soil
to the cleansing sun.

[Carpenter's paper would emphasize the fact that if badger culling is going
to be effective, and remembering that "culling" can eventually come down to
gassing setts and thus killing both infected and non-infected badgers,
virtually all badgers in a designated area must be removed. Capture, test,
and negative-release can be slow, disruptive and expensive. Considering the
very high counts of earthworms per cubic meter of soil, I very much doubt
whether badgers make any impact on their numbers, even at 50 adults per sq.
km, but speculation can generate ideas for discussion and eventually
testing. However, this thread awaits further hard data. - Mod.MHJ]
