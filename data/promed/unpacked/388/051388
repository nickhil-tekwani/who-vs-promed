[As was mentioned in the latest OIE situation report for Avian influenza (24 Dec 2020) "the H5N8 virus has also reassorted with other wild bird influenza viruses to form new strains of H5N5 and H5N1 HPAI virus." Source: Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) Report No. 19: 4 to 24 Dec 2020. World Organization for Animal Health - OIE https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/OIE_AI_situation_report/HPAI_asof24122020.pdf.

The fact that HPAI subtypes H5N8, H5N5, H5N3, and H5N1 currently circulating in the European continent have been detected in wild birds is very indicative that these viruses are being distributed wherever these wild birds migrate. Poultry producers, small and large alike, must therefore implement all the biosecurity measures necessary to protect their flocks from exposure and infection. - Mod.CRD
