Health authorities in the Bay of Plenty believe children may have
been infected with the potentially deadly _E. coli_ bacteria from
animals at a petting zoo.
A total of 3 children had to receive kidney dialysis after
contracting a strain of the bacteria known as VTEC [Vero
toxin-producing _E. coli_. - Mod.LL].
The Bay of Plenty medical officer of health, Dr Phil Shoemack, says 2
of the children may have contracted the infection after visiting a
petting zoo in Rotorua.
He said _E. coli_ is easily transferred if people do not wash their
hands after touching animals, and he will be working with the 2
petting zoos to ensure they have proper procedures in place to limit
the spread of the infection.

[It is always important to have everyone petting animals, especially
children, wash their hands. _E. coli_ O157:H7 does not require a
large inoculum to cause disease and, as shown below, other outbreaks
have occurred in this setting. The number of overall cases in this
cluster is not stated, but one may wonder, with 3 cases with renal
failure, if the children were treated with antimicrobials. This
infection may manifest more complications (including a higher risk of
renal disease) if antimicrobials are used. Wong et al. (N Engl J Med
2000: 342: 1930-36) reported a relative risk of 14.3 (95 percent
confidence limits of 2.9 to 70.7) for hemolytic-uremic syndrome with
antimicrobial treatment of this infection in children. - Mod.LL]
