Five new outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza have been confirmed in Minnesota and 3 in Iowa; 7 of these were in commercial turkeys. These bring the total number of confirmed outbreaks to 122 with almost 24 million birds affected. Workers are being laid off at a Minnesota turkey processing plant.

Minnesota -- 4 May 2015
-----------------------
A further 8 outbreaks of [highly pathogenic avian influenza] were confirmed by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the USDA on 4 May 2015:
- Minnesota, Swift county: commercial turkeys (number pending)
- Iowa, Sac county: 42 600 commercial turkeys
- Minnesota, Renville county: commercial turkeys (number pending)
- Minnesota, Meeker county: 30 400 commercial turkeys
- Iowa, Madison county: 1 795 900 commercial chickens
- Minnesota, Kandiyohi county: commercial turkeys (number pending)
- Minnesota, Kandiyohi county: commercial turkeys (number pending)
- Iowa, Cherokee county: 44 700 commercial turkeys.

In each of these outbreaks, the cause has been confirmed as the H5N2 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of mixed Eurasian and American origin. All these outbreaks are in the area of the Mississippi flyway for migrating birds.

Iowa -- 5 May 2015
------------------
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship reported on 5 May 2015 that it is responding to 3 probable cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry farms:
- Buena Vista county 9: turkey farm (number pending)
- Buena Vista county 10: turkey farm (number pending)
- Sioux county 4: 60 000 commercial layers.

In each outbreak, increased mortality was observed. Initial testing was positive for H5 avian influenza. Additional confirmatory testing is pending from the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames. State officials have quarantined the premises and once the presence of the disease is confirmed, all birds on the property will be humanely euthanised to prevent the spread of the disease.

If confirmed, these 4 new cases would bring the state total so far to 25 outbreaks.

Minnesota -- 5 May 2015
-----------------------
On 5 May 2015, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health announced 2 presumptive positive flocks. Both suspected outbreaks are in turkeys in Kandiyohi county. The numbers of birds affected are still pending. These bring the total number of birds affected in Minnesota to 5 487 232 (excluding pending flocks) on 82 farms in 21 counties.

Bird flu has begun to claim Minnesota meat plant jobs, idling 233 workers at a Jennie-O plant in Faribault, reports Star Tribune. The temporary cuts are the 1st publicly announced lay-offs connected with the avian flu. Jennie-O, a division of Austin-based Hormel Foods, has been hit hard since the bird flu surfaced in Minnesota 2 months ago. Jennie-O is the nation's 2nd largest turkey processor, relying on Minnesota and Wisconsin for its birds. The company said in a statement it will move to a single processing shift in Faribault for the "foreseeable future," effective on 26 May 2015.

Wisconsin: new theory over virus spread
---------------------------------------
A highly contagious avian influenza virus has spread to 1.1 million chickens in Wisconsin -- or 20.4 per cent of the state's egg-laying chicken population -- after a 3rd commercial facility in Jefferson County learned it was infected. John Brunnquell, the president of Egg Innovations, a Port Washington-based egg-laying company with 60 farms in 5 states told Chippewa Herald: "We believe all these infections you're hearing about now are from facility to facility." The theory gaining the most steam is that the virus has mutated so that it can stay active on feathers, dust, or manure long enough to reach a poultry facility by air after it is blown out of another facility's exhaust system that is located nearby.

Warning over possible egg price rises ahead. Experts said the cost could more than double in the coming weeks as a result of the bird flu, according to Channel 3000.

Overview of high-path avian flu outbreaks in US poultry
The following information is based on published USDA APHIS outbreak reports:
- The latest cases bring the total number of confirmed high-path avian flu outbreaks since December 2014 to 122.
- Outbreaks have occurred in poultry in 13 states.
- 3 of the early outbreaks were caused by the H5N8 sub-type of the virus but in all those since mid-February 2015, an H5N2 variant of mixed Eurasian and American origin has been confirmed.
- The majority of outbreaks have been in commercial turkeys (92); 17 have been in commercial chickens, one in a mixed commercial flock and 12 in backyard flocks.
- The number of poultry affected by these outbreaks now exceeds 23.98 million. This figure includes more than 19.29 million commercial chickens and 4.61 million commercial turkeys as well as 7173 backyard poultry.
- The disease has also affected 5 captive wild birds.

Iowa bird flu cases increase by 3 to 28
---------------------------------------
More than 20 million of Iowa's chickens will be affected if the latest cases are confirmed. Iowa agriculture officials say 3 additional Iowa poultry farms show signs of the presence of bird flu including 2 more turkey farms in Buena Vista County, raising the number in the county to 10. A Sioux County egg-laying operation with 60 000 chickens also appears to have the virus. Testing is underway to confirm the disease. The farms experienced an unusual number of bird deaths, prompting an initial test which indicated the presence of the H5N2 virus. The new cases raise Iowa's total number to 28 cases in 11 counties.

More than 20 million of Iowa's chickens, about 1/3 of the state's egg-laying hens, will be affected if the latest cases are confirmed. The number of turkeys to be lost is approaching 500 000. The announcement comes one day after the Iowa Department of Agriculture made a similar announcement regarding 4 farms in northwest Iowa.

USDA confirms more highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza [AI] in 11 flocks in Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Minnesota
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza (HPAI) in additional 11 flocks in Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. No human infections with the virus have been detected at this time. CDC considers the risk to people from these HPAI H5 infections in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry, to be low.

USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed HPAI H5N2 in the following counties and states:

- Wright County, Iowa (5 May 2015): 1.03 million chickens
- Cherokee County, Iowa (5 May 2015): 100 000 turkeys; 2nd detection in this county
- Lewis County, Missouri (5 May 2015): mixed poultry (number pending) [Separate report indicates 10-12 out of 130 birds in backyard flock affected; see http://www.newsplex.com/home/headlines/Birds-in-MO-Confirmed-with-Avian-Flu-302804611.html. - Mod.MHJ]
- Barron County, Wisconsin (5 May 2015): 57 200 turkeys; 4th detection in this county
- Barron County, Wisconsin (5 May 2015): 182 400 turkeys; 5th detection in this county
- Nicollet County, Minnesota (5 May 2015): turkeys (number pending)
- Pipestone County, Minnesota (5 May 2015): 72 200 turkeys; 2nd detection in this county
- Swift County, Minnesota (5 May 2015): 151 300 turkeys; 5th detection in this county
- Kandiyohi County, Minnesota (5 May 2015): 89 100 turkeys; 27th detection in this county
- Kandiyohi County, Minnesota (5 May 2015): 37 300 turkeys; 29th detection in this county*
- Kandiyohi County, Minnesota (5 May 2015): 40 600 turkeys; 30th detection in this county

*Gaps in numbers reflect delays in confirmatory testing of some samples.

The affected premises have been quarantined and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system. According to USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, in 2014, the US poultry industry produced 8.54 billion broiler chickens, 99.8 billion eggs, and 238 million turkeys.

The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world. As part of the existing USDA avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners as well as industry are responding quickly and decisively to these outbreaks by following these 5 basic steps:
1. Quarantine: restricting movement of poultry and poultry-moving equipment into and out of the control area;
2. Eradicate: humanely euthanizing the affected flock(s);
3. Monitor region: testing wild and domestic birds in a broad area around the quarantine area;
4. Disinfect: kills the virus in the affected flock locations; and
5. Test: confirming that the poultry farm is AI virus-free. USDA also is working with its partners to actively look and test for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Behind the scenes: producers prepared
-------------------------------------
While we continue to read and hear in the media about the presence in the United States of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza, commonly called HPAI, sometimes it's what we don't read that is equally as important to livestock and poultry producers and consumers.

As of the end of March [2015], the media has shared information regarding the spread of HPAI from its 1st case at a commercial poultry farm in California to Missouri, Minnesota, Kansas, and Arkansas. The media has also kept its readers and listeners informed about numerous countries -- including China, Mexico, the EU, and most of Central America -- banning US poultry and egg imports from either the entire United States or states where the virus has been found.

And, thankfully, the media has included information from the Centers for Disease Control calling the risk to people from the H5 HPAI infections in wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial poultry "low" and that "no human infections with the virus has been detected" at this time.

What hasn't been in the media eye, however, are the preparedness activities that are minimizing the risk of exposure of poultry flocks to HPAI, thereby limiting its spread and saving numerous poultry producers from having to depopulate their flocks. The same activity also deserves significant credit for maintaining business continuity -- a big deal when you consider the United States produces nearly 80 billion eggs annually and the average US family of four consumes 1000 eggs per year. This behind-the-scene effort is the Secure Egg Supply Plan, a robust collaborative partnership that USDA APHIS Veterinary Services and the egg industry have supported since its introduction in 2008.

Funded by USDA APHIS National Preparedness and Incident Coordination Center, the Secure Egg Supply Plan is a collaboration between the federal government, state governments, industry, and academia. The Secure Egg Supply Plan involves specific science-based and risk-based recommendations that emergency decision-makers -- such as federal and state officials -- can use to rapidly decide whether to issue or deny permits for the movements of egg industry products during an HPAI outbreak.
