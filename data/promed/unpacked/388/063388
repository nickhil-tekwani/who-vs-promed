http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20140320_Hatboro_man_arrested_for_sending_ricin-laced_card.html


A Hatboro [Pennsylvania] man was arrested Wednesday night [19 Mar 2014] for allegedly sending a scratch-and-sniff birthday card laced with ricin to a man now dating his ex-girlfriend, authorities said.

The 19-year-old was charged with attempted murder and risking catastrophe after lab tests allegedly showed that the card he placed in the man's family mailbox on [6 Mar 2014] was discovered this week [week of 17 Mar 2014] to have contained traces of the toxic substance, Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler said.

The form of the substance was unclear. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] says ricin can be distributed as a powder, mist, pellet, or dissolved in water.

Heckler stressed that the toxin was "very potent" and that the arrestee "hit the jackpot."

"He made ricin," Heckler said, "and if you lick that card, you're dead."

The arrested man had bragged of the toxic card to a coworker at Target in Warrington on [6 Mar 2014], according to a probable cause affidavit. The coworker then notified police, the affidavit says, and police called the man's home and spoke to his mother, asking whether she had retrieved the mail that day.

The mother, who, like her son, was not identified, told police that her daughter was outside retrieving the mail at that moment, according to the affidavit. Police advised them to return the mail to the mailbox, and authorities then came to the home to retrieve the card.

Initial tests did not indicate that the card contained ricin, according to Heckler.

When the arrested man was 1st questioned about the incident, on [7 Mar 2014], he told police that he had only coated the card with sodium hydroxide, the affidavit says, which he chose because it resembled the toxin anthrax.

The perpetrator also admitted to sending threatening messages to the man via Facebook, according to the affidavit, and police seized from him (the perpetrator) what appeared to be sodium hydroxide and a notebook with a ricin recipe after questioning.

The arrested man was charged on [7 Mar 2014] with terroristic threats and harassment.

In the meantime, Heckler said, authorities sent the card away for subsequent lab tests. The results, returned to the District Attorney's Office on Tuesday [18 Mar 2014], confirmed that the card had traces of ricin, according to Heckler.

The dose on the card was not in a powder form that could spread, Heckler said, and there were no indications that anyone had been harmed by it.

But Heckler added, "If properly deployed, the stuff he put in that envelope would have killed a whole bunch of people."

The Warminster Police Department subsequently led numerous agencies in arresting the 19-year-old on Wednesday night [19 Mar 2014] at his Hatboro apartment, Heckler said. Other agencies included Hatboro police, SWAT and Hazmat teams, and the FBI.

Heckler said those teams were deployed in case the perpetrator had more ricin, a poison that, according to the CDC, is found naturally in castor beans. It can be made by heating the waste material that results from processing the beans, the agency says, and ingestion can lead to death. There is no antidote, the CDC says.

The arrested man could not be reached for comment. He was arraigned about 8 p.m. in front of Judge Charles W. Baum, according to Assistant District Attorney Antonetta Stancu, and was being held in Bucks County Prison without bail.

http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20140321_More_ricin_found_in_Hatboro__neighbors_say_suspect_was_unassuming.html


A secret stash of additional ricin, left over from a 19-year-old Hatboro resident's alleged plot to kill a man dating his ex-girlfriend, was found beneath a gas manhole cover in town Thursday [20 Mar 2014] afternoon, according to authorities.

About 24 hours after police arrested the 19-year-old man at the Eleanor Court apartment he shares with his mother on Byberry Road, authorities retrieved the hidden supply of the toxin, according to Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler.

Heckler said the ricin was found "tucked away" under the manhole. He did not say how much ricin was found or how authorities came to learn it was there.

Heckler said authorities believed it to be the last of the ricin, which they have accused the perpetrator of applying to a scratch-and-sniff birthday card that he subsequently delivered to the family mailbox of his ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend.

The young man, who was charged with attempted murder Wednesday [19 Mar 2014], was described Thursday [20 Mar 2014] by neighbors as a quiet, unassuming presence -- someone they saw as unlikely to attempt such a Hollywood-worthy murder plot.

The man occasionally wore a Boy Scouts uniform, neighbors said, smoked by himself in his garage, and canoodled on his front stoop with his girlfriend.

Beyond that, they said, he attracted little attention until Wednesday night [19 Mar 2014], when an armada of local and federal police officers surrounded the Byberry Road complex, searching for the baby-faced young man.

Some experts say ricin's reputation exceeds its lethal history, but Wednesday's police response showed that they took the perpetrator's alleged threats seriously.

"He knew what he was doing," Heckler said.

Lab tests, Heckler added, indicated that the ricin -- which police believe the teenager made from castor beans -- was particularly potent.

Eleanor Court residents said Thursday [20 Mar 2014] that, while many families in the complex socialize as their young children play in the courtyard, the teen and his mother -- who have lived there for years -- kept to themselves.

The younger man never said much more than hello to others, said Scott Schouldis, 32. "He's probably the guy you go through 12 years of school with and don't remember him," Schouldis said.

John Patrick, 24, who lives across the courtyard from the perpetrator, said that last summer [2013] he'd spot the teen on the stoop with his girlfriend. The 2 would passionately cuddle and kiss, Patrick said, and Patrick thought the teen "seemed a lot younger" than 19, though Patrick admitted they never had a long conversation.

Attempts to reach the perpetrator's family members, former classmates, and coworkers at a Warrington Target store [where the perpetrator worked] were unsuccessful.

Some experts say ricin -- which is banned by international treaties and can be deadly when ingested -- has an outsized reputation.

While a Texas woman pleaded guilty last year [2013] to mailing ricin-laced letters to President Obama and Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, only one person is known to have been killed by ricin, according to Charles P. Blair, a professor at George Mason University who focuses on terrorism.

That occurred in 1978, Blair said, when Bulgarian dissident Gorgi Markov was assassinated in London via injection.

Raymond Zilinskas, director of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Nonproliferation Program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, said most people can detect ricin before they ingest it.

"Nobody is going to open an envelope and say 'Oh, powder? I'm going to eat this. Let me inhale some of this,'" Zilinskas said.

Blair, citing ricin's popularity in movies and television shows, said ricin was "like an actor or a singer that has no talent but somehow catches the limelight."

Still, Heckler insisted that the card could have been lethal and that authorities were "extremely concerned" about the leftovers "getting out into the wide world."

The teen's apartment remained condemned Thursday [20 Mar 2014]; a sign on the door said it was "unsafe for human occupancy."

The ricin-man remained in Bucks County Prison without bail.

Georgetown student charged with possession of ricin
--------------------------------------------------------------
A Georgetown University student has been charged with possessing the powerful toxin ricin after it was discovered in his McCarthy Hall dorm room this week, according to court documents.

Daniel Harry Milzman, 19, of Bethesda is facing federal charges for possession of more than 120 milligrams of the poison -- a potentially lethal amount.

Milzman informed his residential adviser Monday that he had created ricin and showed the adviser a plastic bag containing what he claimed was the substance, court documents say.

The residential adviser notified school counselors, who alerted police. The incident forced the evacuation of McCarthy Hall as investigators combed through Milzman's room and made sure the dormitory was safe.

"Based on our investigation, we do not believe there is any connection to terrorism," said Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the FBI's Washington Field Office. He declined to discuss Milzman's motivation for possessing the toxin.

Friends described Milzman as a bright student who was a National Merit Scholarship semifinalist in high school and on the quiz bowl team. He was part of a group called the Secular Student Alliance at Georgetown, and a friend said he has a "good heart and a good conscience."

Milzman appeared in U.S. District Court in the District on Friday afternoon. He was ordered held pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday. Danny Onorato, an attorney who is working with the Milzman family, declined to comment. Family members did not return calls for comment.

Milzman told FBI investigators after his arrest that he made the ricin in his dorm room about a month ago using materials that he got from local stores, including Home Depot and American Plant Co., court papers say.

During the production, he wore goggles and a dust mask, which authorities later found in the room, according to the court documents. Milzman told investigators that his roommate was not in the room when he made the ricin. He stored the toxin in plastic bags secured with hockey tape.

Ricin, which is produced from castor beans, can cause respiratory failure and organ dysfunction.

"It is relatively easy to make a crude version of ricin," said Milton Leitenberg, a senior research scholar at the University of Maryland. "But it is very difficult to make a good-quality, pure ricin protein."

Georgetown University officials said in an e-mail to students that there was no danger to the school community. Officials have received no reports of anyone being sickened by the ricin. Typically, victims present symptoms within 24 hours of exposure.

University officials said tests did not find the toxin in any other part of the dorm, which houses about 290 students. The school hired contractors to clean the sixth-floor dorm room where the ricin was found. McCarthy Hall has since reopened.

Milzman graduated from Bethesda's Walt Whitman High School in 2012, said Dana Tofig, a spokesman for Montgomery County public schools.

Milzman wasn't the ace of Whitman's quiz bowl team, but the red-headed hockey player stood out among others because he was always chatting, always cracking jokes, said Jan Danis, who coached the team for a time when Milzman was on it.

"It was just lively," said Danis, 68, of Bethesda, who retired from coaching in 2011. "He always had something to say."

Danis said that Milzman seemed to show a particular affinity for English, although she could not recall whether he ever talked specifically about his college or career plans, and he played on the school's hockey team.

She said everyone assumed he would go to Georgetown, where his father worked.

Her overall experience with Milzman, Danis said, was a positive one. Had he asked her for a letter of recommendation, she said she would have offered one.

Danis said that she had not kept in touch with Milzman since she left Whitman, and she was surprised to learn that authorities said he had made ricin.

"It does seem like some kind of cry for help. I mean, what would be the point of doing it?" she said. "That doesn't make any sense. I can't imagine that he would go use it."

[How strange that this case has been happening for some time, based upon the 1st article, but because of the CDC findings has only recently been made public, and coincidentally on the heels of ricin allegedly being found at Georgetown University in Washington DC.

I wonder if the 2 cases are in some way, however remote, connected. Did the perpetrators know each other, even on email, Facebook, or Twitter? Were they classmates at some point in their life? Or perhaps there is no connection. Perhaps 2 ricin cases on the east coast within a few days of each other is just a coincidence.

More about ricin can be found in the moderator's comments of ProMED-mail post 20140320.2343555.
