7 people have been admitted to area hospitals, and 2 of them have died, in what health officials described Tuesday as a "cluster" of respiratory illnesses with flulike symptoms.

Of the 7 people, 2 have died and the other 5 remain hospitalized, one in an intensive care unit. No specific hospitals were named.

The illnesses date back as far as [19 Apr 2013] and to as recent as Monday [20 May 2013].

The Houston County Health Department held a press conference on Tuesday [21 May 2013] morning to release some details.

The symptoms are flu-like, with those affected suffering from fever, shortness of breath, and cough. There are no other similar clusters of this illness in Alabama. All the cases are from within a 10-county area in Southeast Alabama.

The Alabama Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control have recommended hospitals use precautions, including having staff use protective masks.
Health officials aren't sure who is at risk, but advise anyone displaying symptoms to seek advice from their physician.

Anybody with general questions can contact the Houston County Health Department at 334-678-2800.

[Reports of clusters of undiagnosed severe acute respiratory illness [SARI] associated with fatalities are disconcerting at any time, but given the outbreaks of SARI due to influenza A (H7N9) in China this year, and the ongoing occurrence of SARI due to the MERS-CoV related to contact in the Middle East, this report of a cluster of as yet undiagnosed SARI in Southern Alabama in the USA raises concerns. While one presumes the routine influenza virus testing has been done, results of such laboratory testing are not mentioned in the above reports.

More information on this cluster would be greatly appreciated including laboratory testing thus far, epidemiologic features of the cases -- age, sex, history of travel, history of contact with other cases or animals.
