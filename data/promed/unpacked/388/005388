Sick people ranged in age from 30 to 80 years, with a median age of 60 years, and 56% were female. Of 6 people with information available, 3 were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the 7 people interviewed, all reported eating shrimp before getting sick. At least one of the 3 additional sick people ate frozen cooked shrimp that was not part of the recall.

Laboratory data

Whole-genome sequencing of bacteria from 5 people's samples did not predict any antimicrobial resistance. CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently conducting standard antibacterial susceptibility testing.

[A recall of the frozen cooked shrimp has been expanded. As the product involves cooked shrimp, the contamination likely occurred in the processing of the shrimp after cooking, or the cooking process was faulty. Shrimp are not usual carriers for _Salmonella_ but can more commonly carry _Vibrio_ species that can cause gastroenteritis.

Previously, recalls have been announced for shrimp due to contamination with _Salmonella_, but most of them were not associated with human infections. In 2016, however, the Maricopa (AZ) County Department of Public Health [Salmonellosis, st Javiana - USA: (AZ) susp. frozen shrimp 20161019.4570858] released a report on their investigation into a _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Javiana outbreak that sickened at least 50 people in July and August 2016. There were 40 confirmed cases and 10 probable cases. A total of 33 (66%) of the cases reported eating at one restaurant. As many as 40 other restaurants or fast-food establishments were reportedly patronized by patients. Up to 3 had more than one person reporting eating there within the week before illness onset with 2 cases each. Although all the human cases were serotype Javiana, the frozen unopened box of U10 shrimp were serotyped as _S._ Weltevreden, and the 5 re-packaged shrimp were serotyped as _S._ Javiana. The 5 prepped/re-packaged shrimp all match the outbreak PFGE pattern of _S._ Javiana. - Mod.LL
