North Dakota: West Nile Virus-positive Horses
-----------------------------------------------------
State officials are awaiting test results to determine whether a third
horse in North Dakota has been infected with the West Nile virus.
Dr. Larry Schuler, the state veterinarian, said on Mon 29 Jul 2002 that
preliminary tests indicate the horse in Ransom County has the virus. He
expects to know for sure by the end of the week, when more tests are
finished. The virus has been confirmed in 2 other horses, one in Grand
Forks County and on in Richland County. Those animals were put to
death.
Schuler said he has had calls from veterinarians about other horses as
well. "There's probably 5 or 6 more that are showing clinical signs.
They could be other things besides West Nile," Schuler said. "They're
all in the eastern part of the state." The questions come from
veterinarians and horse owners in Barnes, Cass, Grand Forks, Ransom,
Richland, and Walsh counties, he said.
South Dakota: West Nile Virus-positive Horses
-----------------------------------------------------
The South Dakota Animal Industry Board announced on Mon 29 Jul
2002 that the mosquito-borne West Nile virus has been confirmed in 2
horses. Dr. Sam Hofland, state veterinarian, said laboratory results late
Friday [confirmed] the disease in a Marshall County horse that was
euthanized Wednesday. On Saturday, laboratory results confirmed
another case of West Nile virus in a Kingsbbury County horse. That
horse was also euthanized.
The news comes just days after the state Department of Public health
announced that a crow found in northeast Aberdeen tested positive for
the disease, the first confirmation that West Nile is in South Dakota.

the first discovery of the virus in birds in this state. - Mod.CP]
