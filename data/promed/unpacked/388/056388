On Monday [24 Sep 2007], China dismissed as "groundless" allegations
that the deadly blue ear pig disease had spread from the nation to
neighbouring Viet Nam and Myanmar [Burma] and denied any cover-up.
"It is groundless to say China has transmitted the disease to the 2
countries," a veterinarian with the ministry of agriculture, Li Jinxiang, said.
Li said he had heard the disease had occurred in eastern and central
parts of Viet Nam from his Vietnamese counterparts, but the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health) had not reported the epidemic
on its website. [A summary of Viet Nam's 3 reports to the OIE is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5199>.

Meanwhile, Myanmar has yet to officially confirm the outbreak of the
disease, he said. [Indeed, there is no PRRS report from Myanmar on
OIE's website. Information will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
"The disease, also called PRRS (porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome), was 1st recognised in the USA in 1987 and spread to
Canada, Germany, and Netherlands in the following 4 years," Li was
quoted as saying by Xinhua news agency.
"Currently, the disease exists in major pig-raising countries in the
world," he said. He said China had notified international
organisations including OIE and the Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) of the DNA sequences of the virus and the epidemics. [The
summary of China's 2 PRRS reports to the OIE is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5880>.
- Mod.AS]
Li also gave assurances that China's agriculture ministry is
responsible, and would inform the public of all potential epidemics
in a timely fashion.
Since the beginning of 2007, the blue ear pig disease has plagued 294
Chinese counties and infected 292 000 pigs, of which 77 000 died. The
ministry has administered 510 million millilitres of vaccines to
immunise more than 200 million pigs.

China denied Monday [24 Sep 2007] it tried to cover up a pig disease
that has killed tens of thousands of pigs in China and insisted that
outbreaks in Viet Nam and Myanmar did not come from the country.
"The Chinese government has strict regulations on the reporting of
epidemics and their disclosure," said Li Jinxiang, deputy director of
the Agriculture Ministry's veterinary bureau. "China's Ministry of
Agriculture is a responsible entity and always provides timely
disclosures when it has information on epidemics."
Vice Minister Gao Hongbin told reporters that the latest official
number of pigs that had been infected with blue ear pig disease had
risen to around 290 000. This compares with 257 000 as of late August
[2007], 68 000 of those dying. But experts quoted in the Western
media have expressed doubts about China's official figures,
suspecting the government is trying to keep a lid on a more serious crisis.
Li said China had been reporting outbreaks of the disease and had
provided sequencing data of the virus to the World Organisation for
Animal Health [OIE] and the Food and Agriculture Organisation [FAO]
since epidemics were found last year [2006]. He rejected Western
media reports that China had refused to share virus samples with
international organisations and other countries, arguing it had never
received requests from them. "To this day, the Ministry of
Agriculture has not received a request from any international
organisation or other countries' laboratories for samples and
viruses," Li said. "Countries all over the world have very strict
regulations on the import of viruses and samples."
Li also denied that a similar virus detected in neighbouring Viet Nam
and Myanmar had come from China, instead arguing that the blue ear
disease found in China displays similarity with the virus that
originated from the United States in the 1980s. "This demonstrates
that China is also a victim and the (reported) spread of the disease
to Viet Nam and Myanmar is groundless," he said.
Last month [August 2007], China's chief vet Jia Youling said some
local authorities may have covered up the outbreaks but the problem
was not as bad as reported by some media. Jia said then more than
100 million of the country's 500 million pigs had been inoculated
with an effective vaccine, which had been distributed to the regions
most seriously hit. He said the spread of the disease was now under
"preliminary control."
No one at FAO's Beijing office was immediately available for comment
on Monday [24 Sep 2007].
The highly pathogenic blue ear pig disease, or porcine reproductive
and respiratory syndrome, is characterised by reproductive failure,
death in young pigs and mild respiratory disease in pigs of all ages.
It was 1st reported in the United States in 1987. The spread of the
disease has emerged as a major health concern for China and has been
blamed for contributing to a sharp spike in prices of pork, a staple
of the Chinese diet.

[Could the Chinese statement about provision of "sequencing data of
the virus" to OIE and FAO, be in fact related to the publication, in
June 2007, of the paper by Tian et al? (Emergence of Fatal PRRSV
Variants: Unparalleled Outbreaks of Atypical PRRS in China and
Molecular Dissection of the Unique Hallmark; PLoS ONE, available at
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1885284>
See details in ProMED-mail post 20070622.2017).
FAO was, reportedly, recently engaged in forwarding samples from Viet
Nam to international reference laboratories for virological studies
(see ProMED mail post 20070824.2773). Available results, as well as
confirmation from FAO or OIE regarding the Chinese statement above on
additional information sent to them, will be welcomed.
On 21 Aug 2007, ProMED-mail published the following commentary:
"Hopefully, internationally reputable diagnostic and/or research
centres will express their willingness to receive representative
samples from China and offer their services for comparative studies
with PRRS virus strains from other sources including Viet Nam,
pertaining to infectivity, pathogenicity, serology, and genetic
profiling, and to check the possible involvement/interaction with
other pathogens. ProMED-mail will gladly publish such offers" (see
post 20070821.2730).
The offer/suggestion above is hereby repeated. - Mod.AS]
