The worldwide emergence of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis
(XDR TB) and a provisional definition for this form of TB were 1st
reported in November 2005 (1,2). A more detailed description of these
findings and preliminary data from the USA National TB Surveillance
System (NTSS) were published in 2006 (3). The USA data indicated that
74 TB cases reported during 1993-2004 met the case definition for XDR
TB (3). Subsequent reports suggested different definitions for XDR TB
(4,5). In October 2006, the WHO (World Health Organization) convened
an Emergency Global Task Force on XDR TB, which revised the case
definition to specify resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin
among 1st line anti-TB drugs, resistance to any fluoroquinolone, and
resistance to at least one 2nd line injectable drug (amikacin,
capreomycin, or kanamycin) (6).
This report updates the 2006 report on XDR TB in the USA, using the
revised case definition and provisional data for 2006. NTSS data were
analyzed for reported XDR TB cases during 1993-2006; a total of 49
cases (3 percent of evaluable multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB cases) met
the revised case definition for XDR TB. Of these, 17 (35 percent)
were reported during 2000-2006. Compared with 1993-1999, cases from
2000-2006 were more likely to be in persons who were foreign-born and
less likely to be in persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
XDR TB presents a global threat and a challenge to TB-control
activities in the USA. To prevent the spread of XDR TB, renewed
vigilance is needed through drug-susceptibility testing, case
reporting, specialized care, infection control, and expanded capacity
for outbreak detection and response.
TB cases reported to NTSS from 50 states and the District of Columbia
(DC) were analyzed for the period 1993-2006. All culture-confirmed
cases with initial drug-susceptibility test (DST) results reported
for at least isoniazid and rifampin were included in the analysis.
Because susceptibility testing is time consuming, especially for 2nd
line drugs, initial DST results are reported separately to avoid
delaying reporting of routine TB case data. At the end of treatment,
the outcome is reported in a 2nd follow-up report. The HIV status of
TB cases reported to NTSS was available through 2006, except in
California, where only data on positive HIV test results were
available through 2004.
TB cases reported during 1993-1999, a period of rapidly decreasing
incidence of both TB and MDR TB, were compared with cases reported
during 2000-2006, a period of slower decline in TB and MDR TB rates.
During 1993-2006, a total of 202 436 culture-confirmed TB cases were
reported to NTSS; 190 312 of these cases had initial DST results for
at least isoniazid and rifampin, including 2927 (2 percent) with
initial resistance to both drugs (that is, MDR TB). Of the 2927 MDR
TB cases, 1665 (57 percent) had DST results reported for at least a
fluoroquinolone and an injectable 2nd line drug. Of these, 49 cases
(3 percent) met the revised definition of XDR TB, including 32 cases
reported during 1993-1999 and 17 cases during 2000-2006 [Table - for
table, see original URL - Mod.LL].
The 49 XDR TB cases were reported from 9 states and one city, with
the largest numbers in New York City (19 cases) and California (11
cases) [Figure - for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. HIV status
was known for 29 (59 percent) of the 49 persons with XDR TB; 16 (55
percent) were HIV positive. During 1993-1999, a total of 19 persons
with XDR TB had known HIV status, of whom 14 (74 percent) were HIV
positive; during 2000-2006, 10 persons had known HIV status, of whom
2 (20 percent) were HIV positive. The number and percentage of
persons with XDR TB in the group aged 25-44 years decreased from 21
(66 percent) during 1993-1999 to 6 (35 percent) during 2000-2006.
When the 2 periods were compared, the number of XDR TB cases among
foreign-born persons did not change substantially, but the percentage
of XDR-TB cases among foreign-born persons increased from 39 percent
(12 cases) in 1993-1999 to 76 percent (13 cases) in 2000-2006 as the
number of XDR TB cases among USA-born cases decreased. Among
racial/ethnic populations, 9 (28 percent) of 32 XDR TB cases during
1993-1999 were reported among non-Hispanic blacks, decreasing to 2
(12 percent) of 17 cases during 2000-2006. Conversely, the number and
percentage of cases among Asians increased from 3 (9 percent) during
1993-1999 to 7 (41 percent) during 2000-2006. Sputum microscopy for
acid-fast bacilli was positive in 27 (69 percent) of the 39 cases
with known results. Mortality in XDR TB cases was strongly associated
with HIV infection. Among 41 persons with XDR TB and known outcomes,
12 (29 percent) persons died; 10 of those had HIV infection, and the
other 2 did not have HIV test results reported.

MMWR Editorial note
--------------
After approximately 30 years of declining trends, a TB epidemic
occurred in the USA during 1985-1992. From 22 201 cases in 1985 (9.3
per 100 000 population), reported TB increased to 26 673 cases in
1992 (10.4 per 100 000 population) (7). Although the incidence of MDR
TB in the USA was largely unknown before 1993, the number of cases
began increasing in New York City in the early 1980s (8), and
numerous outbreaks of MDR TB were described in the late 1980s and
early 1990s (9). With implementation of elements of the 1992 National
Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis, reported MDR
TB cases declined rapidly (10). TB control activities included
improving laboratory services for rapid, accurate culture and DST,
improving infection control, and strengthening NTSS to include DST
and HIV test results beginning in 1993. The rapid decrease in MDR TB
cases during 1993-1999 likely correlated with the 34 percent decline
in TB cases overall in the USA to 17 501 (6.3 per 100 000) in 1999 (7).
Effective treatment of MDR TB requires administration, for 18-24
months, of 4 to 6 drugs to which the infecting organism is
susceptible, including multiple 2nd line drugs. Beginning in the
1980s, the use of these drugs increased substantially as physicians
and TB control programs treated growing numbers of MDR TB cases.
Increased use of these drugs resulted in MDR TB strains with
extensive resistance to both 1st and 2nd line drugs. Thus, XDR TB in
the 1990s likely represented the legacy of the 1985-1992 TB epidemic
in the USA and treatments to combat the spike in MDR TB cases.
Characteristics of XDR TB cases changed during 2000-2006 in parallel
with the changing epidemiology of TB in general and MDR TB in
particular. These changes included an overall decrease in the number
of cases, a decrease in the proportion of cases in HIV-infected
persons, an increase in the proportion of cases among foreign-born
persons, and an increase in the proportion of Asians among persons
with XDR TB, compared with 1993-1999 (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations:
- the number of XDR TB cases is a minimum estimate because of
incomplete DST data. Although 57 percent of MDR-TB cases had DST
results reported for at least a fluoroquinolone and at least one of
the 3 2nd-line injectable drugs, only 22 percent had DST results
reported for all drug combinations in the definition of XDR TB,
taking into consideration cross-resistance among drugs and data
available in NTSS. Initial TB isolates with any resistance to
rifampin or resistance to any two 1st line drugs should be tested for
susceptibility to a full panel of anti-TB drugs, and the results
should be reported accordingly.
- Aggregate reporting of drug resistance traditionally has been based
only on initial DST results, not on drug resistance that develops
during treatment. Because of the complexity of 2nd line DST, results
can be delayed by several months and might not be included in the
report of initial DST results.
- Approximately 20 percent of reported TB cases do not have positive
cultures that would enable DSTs to be performed.
- NTSS data for 2006 are provisional, and final case counts,
including XDR TB cases, are subject to revision.
- Finally, HIV test results usually are reported to NTSS after both
TB and HIV surveillance systems have verified their annual case
counts. Thus, HIV test results lag behind TB case counts, and data on
HIV status are complete through 2005 but provisional for 2006, except
for California, which provided data only through 2004. In addition,
HIV test results from California are less complete.
The NTSS surveillance data summarized in this report represent an
updated measurement of XDR TB in the USA. However, surveillance data
do not enable a detailed understanding of how most XDR TB cases
arise. For example, the relative importance of person-to-person XDR
TB transmission compared with the emergence of XDR TB in individual
patients as a consequence of inadequate treatment cannot be determined.
Use of 2nd line drugs to treat drug-resistant TB is increasing
throughout the world, presaging substantial increases in XDR TB
internationally. Accurate measures of the incidence, prevalence, and
determinants of XDR TB are needed to target public health responses.
Attention to fundamental aspects of TB control (such as,
surveillance, prompt culture and DST, directly observed treatment,
contact investigation, rapid containment of outbreaks, and infection
control) is needed to control XDR TB in the USA in the same manner
that MDR TB was addressed during the previous decade. The Federal TB
Task Force is developing a domestic and international response for
the American government agencies regarding XDR TB. A senior-level
interagency meeting will be convened to formulate a comprehensive
response and to assign responsibilities for a unified strategic approach.

[Saturday, 24 Mar 2007 is World TB Day. The print copy of MMWR
containing the posting above, provides this text related to the day
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5611a1.htm?s_cid=mm5611a1_e>
"World TB Day is observed on 24 March each year and commemorates the
date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced the discovery of
_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis
(TB). Worldwide, TB remains one of the leading causes of death from
infectious disease. An estimated 2 billion persons (that is, one
third of the world's population) are infected with _M. tuberculosis_.
Each year, approximately 9 million persons become ill from TB; of
these, nearly 2 million die from the disease.
World TB Day provides an opportunity for TB programs, nongovernmental
organizations, and other partners to describe problems and solutions
related to the TB pandemic and to support worldwide TB-control
activities. The theme for this year's observance is "TB Elimination:
Now is the Time!"
After approximately 30 years of decline, the number of TB cases
reported in the USA increased 20 percent during 1985-1992. This led
to a renewed emphasis on TB control and prevention during the 1990s.
However, although the 2006 TB rate is the lowest recorded in the USA
since national reporting began in 1953, the average annual decline
has slowed since 2000. In addition, multidrug-resistant TB remains a
threat, extensively drug-resistant TB has become an emerging threat,
and persons of racial/ethnic minority populations and foreign-born
persons continue to account for a disproportionate number of TB cases.
CDC and its partners are committed to eliminating TB in the USA. In
many states, education and awareness programs convened by local TB
coalitions will take place in commemoration of World TB Day.
Additional information about World TB Day and CDC TB-elimination
activities is available at <http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/tb/worldtbday>."
As seen in South Africa, XDR TB in HIV infected patients can cause
death before the initial cultures are positive, let alone drug
sensitivity testing. The global community has a long way to go to
eradicate TB, especially in the HIV era. - Mod.LL]
