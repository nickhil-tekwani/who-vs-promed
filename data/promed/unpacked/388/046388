There are a lot of kids and staff missing school this fall, and many of the absences are due to norovirus, which is sweeping our schools. "This is not the worst we've ever seen," says Washoe County Epidemiologist, Dr. Randall Todd. In 2013, we had 1200 cases of it. Right now, we have just under 500. But the year isn't over. It could still get worse."

The schools seeing the sickness are cleaning. Carpets are being steamed; toys are all being washed. Books are being bagged up for the 10-day incubation period of the virus. And parents are being asked to keep sick kids home.

"Anytime you have hand touching, sharing books and toys and food, it just increases the chances of passing it on from one person to another," says Dana Balchunas, the Director of Washoe Schools Student Services. But she also says that there are fewer kids getting sick at school and more kids with symptoms staying home. And that should help them get control of it.

Health officials stress the importance of cleaning and disinfecting areas affected by vomiting or diarrhea and recommend the following procedures:
- Always clean with detergent and hot water prior to disinfecting.
- Disinfect with an effective virucide or chlorine solution of one half cup of bleach to one gallon of water.

Here is the list of schools involved in the outbreak:

Alice Smith Elementary School
Bernice Mathews Elementary School
Stead Elementary School
O'Brien Middle School
Bud Beasley Elementary School
McQueen High School
Desert Heights Elementary School
Grace Warner Elementary School
Nancy Gomes Elementary School
Marvin Picollo School
Westergard Elementary School
Brown Elementary School
North Valleys High School

[Washoe County is a county located in the state of Nevada. As of the 2010 census, the population was 421 407, making it the 2nd-most populous county in Nevada.

Norovirus is very contagious. You can get norovirus from an infected person, contaminated food or water, or by touching contaminated surfaces. The virus causes your stomach or intestines or both to get inflamed (acute gastroenteritis). This leads you to have stomach pain, nausea, and diarrhea and to throw up. Anyone can be infected with norovirus and get sick. Also, you can have norovirus illness many times in your life. Norovirus illness can be serious, especially for young children and older adults.

Norovirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis in the United States. Each year, it causes 19-21 million illnesses and contributes to 56 000-71 000 hospitalizations and 570-800 deaths. Norovirus is also the most common cause of foodborne-disease outbreaks in the United States.

According to the CDC, genetic studies have considerably improved norovirus disease incidence estimates for the United States. Norovirus causes 400 000 emergency department visits, 1.7-1.9 million outpatient visits, and 19-21 million total illnesses per year. The outbreaks among school children in schools in Washoe appear to be a consequence of widespread infection in the general community and not generated within the schools.

Norwalk virus, Norwalk-like viruses (NLV) or noroviruses are a group of viruses (germs) that cause diarrheal illnesses. These viruses are named after the original strain that caused an outbreak in Norwalk, Ohio. They are also sometimes referred to as small, roundstructured viruses (SRSV) or caliciviruseslike viruses.

Persons over 65 years of age are at greatest risk for norovirus-associated death, and children under 5 years of age have the highest rates of norovirus-associated medical care visits. Endemic norovirus disease occurs year round but exhibits a pronounced winter peak and increases by 50 percent or more during years in which pandemic strains emerge. These findings support continued development and targeting of appropriate interventions, including vaccines, for norovirus disease. - Mod.CP
