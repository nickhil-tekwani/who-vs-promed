[In order to gain some perspective on the 1st possible case of reinfection of Ebola virus in Mabalako referred to above, see CR MacIntyre and AA Chughtai: Recurrence and reinfection -- a new paradigm for the management of Ebola virus disease. International J Infect Dis. 43: 58-61; February 2016, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2015.12.011. The authors conclude that reinfection with Ebola virus may be possible due to waning or lowered immunity or high viral challenge. To confirm reinfection, one would have to rule out recrudescence, which may be possible with sequencing. - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
Date: 6 Dec 2019
Source: CIDRAP [abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/12/more-ebola-cases-noted-conflict-still-hinders-response


Two more Ebola infections were reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today [6 Dec 2019], with the World Health Organization (WHO) detailing some of effects that attacks and insecurity have had on the response in recent weeks and a key response group pulling staff out of one health zone.

For the week ending 3 Dec 2019, 9 new cases were reported, 5 in Mandima and 4 in Mabalako, the WHO said in its weekly outbreak snapshot.

It said security incidents have slowed the volume and investigation of health alerts, as well as the number of contacts recorded and monitored. The number of health alerts in the conflict-ridden areas trended lower than usual over the past 7 days.

The overall percentage of contacts under monitoring was 70% over the past week, lower than before the security incidents. The decrease was spurred by suboptimal performance in some areas of Beni, Mabalako, and Oicha. The WHO said the numbers are improving slowly, but it said the fluctuations underscore the continued impact insecurity is still having on the outbreak response.

Over the past 21 days, most cases were linked to known transmission chains, but a higher proportion of confirmed infections were linked to exposure to the virus at funerals. The WHO said there were 2 recent funeral-linked clusters, one in Lwemba that resulted in 6 cases, and one in Bingo that led to 2 cases. The people who died were listed as probable cases.

The 2 new cases reflected today [6 Dec 2019] on the WHO's online Ebola dashboard bring the outbreak total to 3320. Health officials are still investigating 357 suspected cases.

Two more people died from their infections, lifting the fatality count to 2206.

The DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) had details about the 5 cases. Three were in Beni, and Mabalako and Oicha each had 1 case.

One health worker is among the newly confirmed cases in Mabalako, raising the number of health workers sickened in the outbreak to 164, which includes 41 deaths.

Response activities are still paralyzed in Beni, Mangina, and Biakato, the CMRE said. It added that immunization efforts continue, including a new vaccine ring of 60 contacts or of contacts of contacts that opened around a recently confirmed case in Beni.

The violence has gotten so bad in Biakato, in fact, that Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said it has temporarily withdrawn its staff from that region of Ituri province.

In a news release, the nonprofit group said that a group of people armed with sticks and machetes entered the Biakato health center in the early morning of 3 Dec 2019. They didn't reach the center's Ebola treatment unit, and no one was harmed. The same night, however, a similarly armed group attempted to enter the MSF compound in Biakato Mines. They threw rocks at the compound but were unsuccessful in entering it, and, again, no one was injured.

The events follow a deadly attack against Ebola responders in Biakato in late November 2019.

"MSF cannot work if the security of our staff and patients is not ensured," the group said. "It is not clear yet who was responsible for the attempted intrusion on the compound or into the health centre, nor are the motivations behind those actions clear. As we are not currently able to guarantee that the necessary security conditions to work have been met, MSF decided to temporarily withdraw our staff from the Biakato region. The decision to leave this community, with whom we have worked very closely over the past few years, was extremely hard to take."

MSF said it left essential supplies with the DRC health ministry to continue response efforts in Biakato, and it hopes to be able to return soon to the area.

Researchers from the University of Tokyo, meanwhile, announced that they will begin a clinical trial of a developmental Ebola vaccine later this month [December 2019], Kyodo News reported.

The vaccine contains an artificially produced detoxified virus and has been shown to be safe and to prompt a good immune response in animal studies. It was developed by a team led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, DVM, PhD and is intended to produce fewer side effects.

The clinical study, the 1st involving Ebola vaccine in Japan, will take place at a hospital affiliated with the university, and 30 healthy adult men are slated to receive an intramuscular injection and be monitored for 6 months to gauge vaccine safety.

[3] Violence
- Fri 6 Dec 2019. Butembo [Radiomoto (abridged, edited)]
http://www.radiomoto.net/2019/12/06/nord-kivu-choc-securitaire-a-butembo-ce-vendredi-06-decembre/


The city of Butembo is in shock security since the morning of Fri 6 Dec 2019. Socio-economic activities remain paralyzed.

Barricades of roads with large stones, fires, symbols of coffins, shrubs and kiosks in different corners of this city, obligation to remove the shoes of passers-by in other corners, and the sounds of real bullets by the police and the FARDC trying to restore order are behaviors that paralyze academic, social and economic activities in Butembo, in Mutsanga, Furu, Kitatumba, Kambali, Vusenzera and Njiapanda. Some young people were thrown into the PNC's intervention jeep for their arrest.

[4] Interview: Personal account Dr. Marie-Roseline Belizaire
- Sat 7 Dec 2019 [NPR. Goats and Soda (abridged, edited)]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/12/07/785549755/this-is-what-its-like-to-be-an-ebola-doctor-under-fire-in-congo

[Byline: Nurith Aizenman]


Dr. Marie-Roseline Belizaire is a field coordinator for health workers who are part of the anti-Ebola effort in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She is an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization.

Dr. Marie-Roseline Blizaire had just gathered the members of her Ebola response team for a morning meeting when they heard the rat-a-tat of gunfire.

"It was just in front of our door, very close," she recalls. "We all got on the floor to protect ourselves." They lay there for the next 20 minutes, listening as police fired into the surrounding jungle to drive off a group of armed men who had been spotted trying to make their way toward the compound, an encampment of tents and low-rise buildings near the town of Mangina that serves as living quarters for the team.

The 28 Nov 2019 attack was merely the latest in a series of violent incidents that Belizaire, who is originally from Haiti and is 40 years old, has survived while working as a field coordinator for the World Health Organization over this 16-month long outbreak. Indeed, Belizaire had called that morning meeting to plan next steps in the wake of 2 even more serious attacks hours earlier: The 1st was an hour-long, midnight assault by gunmen on her team's offices a mile away. The 2nd was more devastating: 4 Congolese Ebola responders were killed in a nearly simultaneous attack on the living quarters of another team located a 2-hour drive away.

In total this year [2019], WHO has documented about 390 attacks on health facilities involved with the Ebola response, with 11 Ebola responders killed and more than 80 injured. Globally, according to a United Nations report released this week, so far in 2019, there have been 825 attacks on health-care workers and their facilities, resulting in 171 deaths.

That makes this Ebola episode the most violent on record. NPR reached Belizaire by phone to find out what it's like to be -- quite literally -- on the front lines.

(This conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.)

What does your job entail? In other words, what does it mean to be a field coordinator for the World Health Organization?

It means I'm in charge of making the Ebola response work at the operational level, making sure the response teams have everything they need logistically to fight Ebola. We have divided the coordination area into zones. [Over the course of the outbreak] I've been moving according to where the hot spots are. Right now, I'm responsible for 2 health zones -- with a population of more or less 500 000 -- around the town of Mangina.

The response is a chain. I make sure all parts of the chain in my zones are in the right place. It starts with investigating possible cases, making sure there are ambulances [to take people to Ebola treatment units] and that the Ebola treatment units are working well. Then making sure the infection prevention and control teams [who decontaminate homes and health facilities] have all the technical materials they need. Then mapping the cases, finding the places where [an infected person] has been, who they've been in contact with and vaccinating them. Now we can do that within 24 hours. I supervise that surveillance and vaccination.

This outbreak has been taking place in a part of Congo with a long history of conflict between the government and multiple armed groups. Ebola responders have often found themselves in the crossfire, targeted by militants as well as some members of the population who consider health workers an extension of government authority.

How many of these violent episodes have you personally experienced during this outbreak?

There have been a lot of times I have been personally worried by gunshots around our coordination offices. Sometimes it's the police trying to break up a demonstration. Sometimes it's a confrontation between police and militias.

Last April [2019] when our colleague Dr. Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung was killed [by gunmen who stormed into a meeting he was leading in the city of Butembo] my team was based in Katwa. It's a locality right next to Butembo. And that same day Katwa was attacked on multiple sides by militias. So we were hearing all these gunshots. And we had to get on the floor and put on bullet-proof vests to protect ourselves. Then that night our team's offices in Katwa were attacked. The bullets left marks in the wall of my office. But the worst experience were those attacks in the early hours of 28 Nov 2019.

Tell us more about how that night unfolded.

It began about 15 minutes after midnight. I was still up meeting with my counterparts with Congo's ministry of health, because we often have to work late at night, when we heard gunfire in the distance. I called the security officer to find out what was happening. He said, "Let me call the police." The police told him, "There's an attack going on, we'll have to call you back." An hour later they called us to let us know that about 20 armed men had tried to reach our offices, about a mile away from our living compound. But the police disbursed them, killing one of the bandits.

A few minutes after that attack had started, I got a call from a colleague with a team based at Biakato mines [about a 2-hour drive away] to tell me "we are under fire, we are under attack." The difference was [in their case] the gunmen were attacking the compound where [the health workers] were living.

I stayed on the phone with them through to the end -- more than 3 hours -- calling around to find out where everyone was, telling them: Try to stay calm, we are supporting you, rescuers are coming. I could hear the bullets flying on the phone line. Some of them were telling us, "Please, help!" And it was heartbreaking because you know in that moment you can't help. A policeman and 2 drivers for that team were killed, and a colleague who did vaccinations. She was sexually abused and then killed with 4 bullets. Seven of our colleagues were also severely injured.

Where are you now?

My team has been evacuated to Goma [a city 200 miles south of the outbreak zone]. But we are already preparing to go back. Our Mangina compound has received too many threats. It's not safe for us to stay there. So we'll be operating from Beni [a city about 16 miles from Mangina]. And we'll be proposing just essential staff to go there so we can shorten their exposure time in the field.
