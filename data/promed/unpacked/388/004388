Caprine arthritis/encephalitis, UK
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 16 Dec 2019 from Dr Christine Middlemiss, Chief Veterinary Officer, DEFRA, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 29 Sep 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 12 Nov 2019
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks: (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Londondery, Northern Ireland
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Sep 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Goats / 6 / 1 / 0 / 6 / 0 /
Affected population: a hobby goat herd consisting of 4 Boer female goats (does), 1 pygmy female goat (doe), and 1 young male Boer goat (buck). Only one of the Boer does was positive for caprine arthritis/encephalitis virus antibodies. The whole herd was euthanized as a precaution.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 16.67 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the 1st confirmation of caprine arthritis/encephalitis (CAE) in Northern Ireland was detected during the annual surveillance activity in an animal following samples taken on [20 Sep, 26 Sep, and 14 Oct 2019], all of which tested negative with AGID [agar gel immunodiffusion] but positive with ELISA for CAE virus antibodies. Backward and forward tracings, as well as the full epidemiological investigation, are ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; traceability; quarantine; stamping out; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute, Northern Ireland (regional laboratory) / Goats / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 14 Oct 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Caprine arthritis-encephalitis (CAE) and maedi-visna (MV) are persistent lentivirus infections of goats and sheep. They are often grouped together as the small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs). Maedi-visna is also known as ovine progressive pneumonia (OPP). Phylogenetic analyses comparing nucleotide sequences of MV virus (MVV) and CAE virus (CAEV) have demonstrated that these are closely related lentiviruses. One source of CAEV and MVV transmission is colostrum and milk. The source of horizontal transmission in the absence of lactation remains unknown; however, faeces, and lung fluids are known to harbour infectious virus.

"Ovine lentiviruses have been identified in most of the sheep-rearing countries of the world, with the notable exceptions of Australia and New Zealand. The distribution of CAEV is highest in industrialised countries, and seems to have coincided with the international movement of European breeds of dairy goats.

"Clinical and subclinical MV and CAE are associated with progressive, mononuclear cell inflammatory lesions in the lungs, joints, udder, and central nervous system. Indurative mastitis is common in both host species, and its economic significance may be underestimated. Laboured breathing associated with emaciation caused by progressive pneumonitis is the predominant feature in clinically affected sheep, whereas polyarthritis is the main clinical sign in goats. However, most lentivirus-infected sheep and goats are largely asymptomatic, but remain persistent carriers of the virus and are capable of transmitting infection via colostrum or milk and respiratory secretions.

"The most practical and reliable approach to confirming a diagnosis of MV or CAE is a combination of serology and clinical evaluation. Although serology represents the most cost-effective method of diagnosing infection in persistently infected, clinically normal animals, it should be understood that testing errors can occur. The frequency of error depends on several factors including but not limited to: 1) the assay format, 2) the homology between the strain of virus used in the assay and the strains of virus present in the tested populations, and 3) the viral antigen used in the assay."
