A rabbit in Lafayette has tested positive for tularemia, public officials announced Friday [13 Sep 2019]. The animal was found along the 4900 block of 95th Street, according to Boulder County health officials.

Tularemia is caused by the bacteria _Francisella tularensis_ and is typically found in animals, especially rabbits, rodents, and hares.

Symptoms in humans include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, and more. Symptoms can also include abrupt onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough, difficulty breathing, and more.

Tularemia can be treated when detected in early stages, officials said.

People can become infected with tularemia through the bite of infected insects, most commonly ticks and deer flies, or through skin contact with infected animal tissue. Bacteria can also be inhaled when an infected animal is broken into small particles and spread through the air, such as when an infected carcass is mowed over.

"It's always important to avoid contact with wild animals because of the risk of many diseases," said Lane Drager, Boulder County Public Health Consumer Protection Program coordinator, in a statement. "Although tularemia is rare, it is still a risk, especially considering the number of wild rabbits in our communities."

Five people in Colorado have been diagnosed with tularemia in 2019. So far, 3 rabbits have been tested positive in the state.

Officials said no residents have come into contact with the animal in Lafayette, but a resident's dog did. Officials said the resident took appropriate measures when collecting the rabbit.

Public officials recommend the following precautions:
- Stay out of areas inhabited by wild rabbits and rodents. If you must enter areas frequented by wild animals, always wear insect repellent containing DEET.
- Prevent your pets from hunting or eating wild rodents or rabbits.
- Avoid all contact with wild rabbits and rodents, including squirrels; do not feed or handle them.
- Never touch sick or dead animals with your bare hands. If an animal must be moved, place it in a garbage bag using a long-handled shovel, and place the bag in an outdoor garbage can.
- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes; keep your pets from doing the same.
- Don't mow over animal carcasses, and consider using a dust mask when doing landscape work.
- Avoid ticks. The best protection for pets, especially cats, is to keep them indoors. If outdoors with pets, keep them out of heavily wooded areas, which are ideal habitats for ticks.
- See a healthcare provider if you become ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.
- Contact a veterinarian if your pet becomes ill with a high fever and/or swollen lymph nodes.

[The bacterium that causes tularemia is highly infectious and can enter the human body through the skin, eyes, mouth, or lungs. Symptoms of infection vary depending on the route of entry. Usual sources of infection are described below. Transmission of tularemia from person to person has not been reported.

From the CDC Tularemia webpage:

Signs and symptoms
The signs and symptoms of tularemia vary depending on how the bacteria enter the body. Illness ranges from mild to life-threatening. All forms are accompanied by fever, which can be as high as 104 deg F/ 40 deg C. Main forms of this disease are listed below:

- Ulceroglandular: This is the most common form of tularemia and usually occurs following a tick or deer fly bite or after handing of an infected animal. A skin ulcer appears at the site where the bacteria entered the body. The ulcer is accompanied by swelling of regional lymph glands, usually in the armpit or groin.
- Glandular: Similar to ulceroglandular tularemia but without an ulcer. Also generally acquired through the bite of an infected tick or deer fly or from handling sick or dead animals.
- Oculoglandular: This form occurs when the bacteria enter through the eye. This can occur when a person is butchering an infected animal and touches his or her eyes. Symptoms include irritation and inflammation of the eye and swelling of lymph glands in front of the ear.
- Oropharyngeal: This form results from eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Patients with oropharyngeal tularemia may have sore throat, mouth ulcers, tonsillitis, and swelling of lymph glands in the neck.
- Pneumonic: This is the most serious form of tularemia. Symptoms include cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. This form results from breathing dusts or aerosols containing the organism. It can also occur when other forms of tularemia (e.g., ulceroglandular) are left untreated and the bacteria spread through the bloodstream to the lungs.
- Typhoidal: This form is characterized by any combination of the general symptoms (without the localizing symptoms of other syndromes).

Tularemia can be difficult to diagnose. It is a rare disease, and the symptoms can be mistaken for other, more common, illnesses. For this reason, it is important to share with your healthcare provider any likely exposures, such as tick and deer fly bites or contact with sick or dead animals.

Blood tests and cultures can help confirm the diagnosis. Antibiotics used to treat tularemia include streptomycin, gentamicin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. Treatment usually lasts 10-21 days depending on the stage of illness and the medication used. Although symptoms may last for several weeks, most patients completely recover.

_Francisella tularensis_ is highly infectious when grown in culture, and laboratory-acquired infections have been documented. The isolation of _F. tularensis_ from clinical specimens, especially if unanticipated, can generate concern among laboratory workers about possible exposure.

Management options for potentially exposed workers include a "fever watch" or antimicrobial prophylaxis. During a fever watch, workers monitor their temperature with instructions to seek immediate treatment for tularemia if they develop a fever (usually defined as a single oral temperature above 101 deg F or 38.5 deg C).

There are no set criteria for determining who should be managed by fever watch and who would benefit from immediate prophylaxis.

Colorado health officials have recorded 11 human cases of tularemia since May2015, putting the state on pace for one of the most widespread years for the disease in more than 2 decades.

In 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recorded 16 human cases, representing the 2nd-highest number of cases since 1983, when there were 20.

So while we may not know the number for this year [2019], 3 in a short period of time clearly indicates we need to be aware of situations representing potential exposure. - Mod.TG
