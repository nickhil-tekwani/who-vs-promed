West Nile virus has been blamed for killing one horse on Long Island and
sickening 10 others, state agriculture officials said Tuesday. Tests by
the federal agriculture department and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention have confirmed that at least one dead horse had the virus and
another 10 sick horses are carrying antibodies to the virus.
Since late August, 22 horses in Suffolk County have shown signs of the
mosquito-borne virus, according to a release issued Tuesday by state
Agriculture Commissioner Nathan L. Rudgers. Thirteen of those horses have
died or been euthanized, and the other nine horses are recovering.
West Nile virus in New York City was discovered in early September, and has
claimed six lives and infected 55 others in the New York City area.
Symptoms in humans include rapid onset of headache, high fever,
disorientation, tremors and convulsions. It can lead to paralysis and death.
State agriculture officials are now recommending that horses be stabled
inside from dusk to dawn, which are the normal mosquito feeding times.
Horse owners are also being urged to use insect repellants on their horses.
Horses that contract the virus cannot pass it on to other horses, to
people, or to pets, Rudgers said. West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes
that acquire the virus from wild birds.
Veterinarians initially thought the horse deaths and illnesses were caused
by Equine Protozoal Myelitis, a relatively common disease in horses. But
state and local veterinarians later noticed unusual symptoms and an
increasing number of horses becoming sick, rousing suspicions that West
Nile virus may be the cause.
The virus - never before recorded in the Western Hemisphere - is believed
to have entered the United States in infected birds. Hundreds of dead birds
have been found in recent weeks from Connecticut south to New Jersey and
Long Island.
Signs of the virus in horses include lethargy, weakness in the hind
quarters, stumbling and loss of coordination, lack of awareness, head tilt
and twitch, convulsions, circling, hyperexcitability, paralysis and coma.

[In the summer of 1998 ProMED reported the occurrence of equid cases of
West Nile virus encephalitis in Italy. This report of equid infections
with West Nile virus is not surprising. What is surprising is that it has
taken this long to recognize the illness in horses. West Nile virus cycles
between infected birds and mosquitoes. Birds may resolve their viremias by
producing antibodies or by dying but mosquitoes are persistently infected.
If an infected mosquito takes a blood meal from a vertebrate and that
vertebrate is susceptible to the virus, the vertebrate will become
infected. Other livestock and wild vertebrates should be tested to see
whether they have become hosts of the virus. - Mod.CHC
