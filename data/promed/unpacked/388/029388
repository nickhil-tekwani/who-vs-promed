[The involvement of small ruminants in foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemiology in the Maghreb countries and the need to include sheep and goat flocks in the mass vaccination schemes have been repeatedly addressed by Mod.AB in his commentaries accompanying reports on FMD in the ProMED-MENA (Middle East/North Africa) regional list. Some recent examples include http://www.promedmail.org/post/6096858, http://www.promedmail.org/post/5973325, http://www.promedmail.org/post/5947203, and http://www.promedmail.org/post/5255936.

The following comment, published in FAO's monthly FMD situation report for November 2018 (published 21 Dec 2018), is of relevance:

"Considering the recent incursions of FMD in North Africa (years 2014/15 - 2017 - 2018), Algeria-Tunisia-Morocco agreed to implement and share the results of a coordinated multi-country risk based surveillance aimed at verifying the silent circulation of the disease in the region. The surveillance that was carried out before the occurrence of outbreaks in Algeria (2018), was able to demonstrate the presence of FMDV circulation among the small ruminant population in Algeria and in some border areas of Morocco (with Algeria), and Tunisia (with Algeria and Libya)" (http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/November_GMR_2018.pdf).

The relatively small number of reported FMD cases in sheep, as apparent from the above Tunisian follow-up report, may be misleading, reflecting just clinical cases while more -- probably most -- sheep undergo subclinical or unnoticed infection, becoming the reservoir for further virus spread in susceptible cattle.

On Thu 10 Jan 2019, Morocco has joined Algeria and Tunisia and reported its 1st FMD outbreak this year [2019]; see OIE immediate notification at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=29162. - Mod.AS
