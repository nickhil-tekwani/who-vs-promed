[Response to report of a dengue case in New York (ProMED-mail Dengue/DHF update (95): Americas 20131125.2073441)]

Regarding the locally acquired dengue fever case in Suffolk County, NY, _Aedes albopictus_ is definitely present in the area, and has been for the past several years. Overwintering does take place.

We have been monitoring _Ae. albopictus_ populations in the state, and the species is thought to overwinter now as far north as Putnam County, north of New York City.

Anecdotally, _Ae. albopictus_ has been reported to be one of the most prevalent mosquitoes in the general New York City metropolitan area, and individual cases of tropical mosquito-borne diseases like this, can indeed occur. The ingredients are there, particularly given the volume of travel from disease endemic areas into metropolitan airports. One of our education messages resulting from this case will be that physicians be aware of tropical mosquito-borne diseases. An astute local physician suspected dengue, even though the case patient had no international travel in the past several years.

[ProMED-mail thanks Byron Backenson for responding to the query about which vector could be involved in the locally acquired dengue virus infection in Long Island, Suffolk county, New York. Now we know that, as suspected, _Aedes albopictus_ is the mosquito involved, and is capable of going into diapause and overwintering there. As Byron Backenson pointed out, with _Ae. albopictus_ common in New York city, a locality that is an arrival destination for many individuals coming from dengue endemic areas around the world, the risk of ongoing transmission is real.

Brazil (national). 28 Nov 2013. Dengue risk at World Cup venues will reach peak transmission season in Fortaleza, Natal, and Salvador states. Measure to prevent exposure:
- choose accommodation with screened windows and doors, and air conditioning
- use insecticides indoors
- wear clothing that covers the arms and legs, especially during early morning and late afternoon, when mosquitoes tend to bite
- apply insect repellent to clothing and exposed skin.
