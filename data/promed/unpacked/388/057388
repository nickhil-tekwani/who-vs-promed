[I have received notification of a fascinating paper written by Fabian
Leendertz and colleagues. Dr. Leendertz is the Coordinator of the Great Ape
Health Monitoring Unit (GAHMU), Senior Vet. Tai Chimpanzee Project, Cote
d'Ivoire, Robert Koch-Institut, ZBS1, Nordufer 20, 13353 Berlin, Germany;

"A New Bacillus anthracis Found in Wild Chimpanzees and a Gorilla from West
and Central Africa"
Fabian H. Leendertz, Saniye Yumlu, Georg Pauli, Christophe Boesch, Emmanuel
Couacy-Hymann, Linda Vigilant, Sandra Junglen, Svenja Schenk, Heinz Ellerbrok
"We determined that anthrax infection caused the sudden deaths of 6 wild
chimpanzees in the Tai National Park, Cote d'Ivoire in 2001/2002 and in 3
chimpanzees and one gorilla found dead more than 1000 mi to the east, at
the northern periphery of the Dja Reserve, Cameroon 2004/2005. In order to
characterize the _B. anthracis_ isolates from a totally new habitat that
were responsible for the death of wild great apes that died in Cote
d'Ivoire and Cameroon, we performed VNTR analyses on DNA isolated from
tissue samples and bones of these great apes. Surprisingly, for the
isolates from both outbreaks, 3 of the 6 genomic VNTRs were clearly
different from those of any previously described strain, as is evident from
the phylogenetic tree analysis. The strain from Cote d'Ivoire, named _B.
anthracis CI_ (Cote d'Ivoire), and the strain from Cameroon, named _B.
anthracis CA_ (Cameroon) are clearly distinct from group A and group B
strains. They establish a separate branch with a new "forest anthrax
cluster" termed "F," suggesting that _B. anthracis_ is a far less
homogeneous species than is currently believed. No differences were found
among the 6 cases from Cote d'Ivoire, and also the 4 anthrax isolates from
the 3 chimpanzees and the gorilla from Cameroon were identical."
And:
"The detection of 2 closely related strains forming an unrecognized highly
divergent group of _B. anthracis_ at 2 different locations more than 1000
mi apart was highly unexpected and implies distribution through Western and
Central Africa. The presented genetic data suggest that both "classic" and
the "forest anthrax" strains have a common ancestor with _B. cereus_, and
that the forest strains diverged before the other _B. anthracis_ strains
acquired the characteristic _B. anthracis_-specific chromosomal insertions.
From the data obtained, it is not possible to determine whether the
plasmid pXO1 was already present in the CI and CA strains prior to
divergence from the common _B. anthracis_ ancestor, or whether the pXO1
plasmid was acquired independently in _B. anthracis_ group F and "classic"
_B. anthracis_. However, the recent description of a pathogenic B. cereus
strain containing a circular plasmid showing 99.6 percent similarity to the
_B. anthracis_ pXO1 demonstrates that plasmid acquisition has occurred more
than once within _B. cereus_."

[Obviously, the full text should be read and absorbed, as it reveals that
we must reconsider a number of viewpoints on the emergence of this pathogen
and its maintenance in the various African ecosystems. One of the problems
is that it is been essentially impossible to obtain archival cultures of
_B. anthracis_ directly from the West African countries. Therefore nothing
is known of the molecular epidemiology of this pathogen in this region.
What we do know is derived from South & East African cultures, from an
essentially savannah system with animal species to match. - Mod.MHJ]
