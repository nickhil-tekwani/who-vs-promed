[Excerpted from WHO:
"Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‚ÄêCoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked." - Mod.LK]

[2] Saudi Arabia: No Nora University student has MERS

The Ministry of Health (MoH) denied news reports on Fri [16 Oct 2015] that the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was found among students of the Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University in Riyadh.

Dispelling the reports written in some newspapers and websites, Health Ministry spokesman Faisal Al-Zahrani said that the staff and students of the university are safe from the virus.

However, he added that 4 of the female janitors who were working at the university have tested positive for the virus and are now among the 12 MERS cases currently being treated at the ministry's hospitals.

The 4 infected women were contracted through a private company to work for the university as part of a group of 36 workers in total. The women's accommodation is located in Thumamah, in the eastern part of Riyadh.

"We have quarantined the entire group of workers and 4 of them have been sent to hospital for immediate treatment, while the other 32 workers are being kept under observation in their own housing quarters.

The Deputy Minister for Public Health Affairs and the Head of the Control and Leadership Center, Abdulaziz bin Saeed, has disclosed that the group of 32 cleaning employees will be kept under observation for a total of 14 days.

He noted that the situation is under control and that the other women have now tested negative for the disease, but were kept separate from their colleagues as a precautionary measure.

Saeed said that symptoms can take up to 2 weeks to surface, which calls for the daily testing of all collected samples, a process that will continue throughout the entire incubation period of the virus.
