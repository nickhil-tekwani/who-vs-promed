According to the NATIONAL online newspaper from PNG, there was no unusual
illness, according to the Provincial Health Manager (see extract below).
A deserted village in the Yapsie area of Telefomin, West Sepik province,
has baffled medical teams which went there to investigate the cause of a
mysterious illness which has claimed 14 lives.
(snip)
There was no mysterious illness that drew a lot of attention from both
provincial and national authorities last month, he added.
Dr. Woibun, the Provincial Health Manager, said the deaths reported were
sporadic and resulted from common diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis,
pneumonia, and malnutrition among others.
He said that according to the investigations there was no epidemic in the
area.

[This is a non-story. On the one hand we have a "mystery illness" which
has killed 14 people. On the other hand, there is no such illness and
there were no such deaths, but people have died from the usual illnesses of
the area. I hope that when I die someone will notice, and if I have not
died someone will notice that also. This is as far as we can go with this
string, so it is cut.
