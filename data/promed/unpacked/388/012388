[A 19 Oct 2017 announcement issued by the Uganda Ministry of Health (MOH) reported just one fatal case of Marburg disease (see Marburg virus disease - Uganda: (QW) 20171019.5391580). However, the announcement also indicated that a preliminary field investigation reported that prior to her death, the deceased had nursed her 42-year-old brother, who died on 25 Sep 2017 with similar signs and symptoms. She had also closely participated in the cultural preparation of the body for burial. Perhaps this 2nd case is the brother of the case that the MoH reported earlier.

Cases of Marburg virus infection have occurred sporadically in Uganda over several years. - Mod.TY
