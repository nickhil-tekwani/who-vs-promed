-----------------------------------------------
Abstract: An anthrax outbreak occurred in the Wamba area of southern
Samburu, Kenya between December 2005 and March 2006. The outbreak affected
equids including the endangered Grevy's zebras (_Equus grevyi_), plain
zebras (_Equis Burchelli_), and donkeys (_Equus asinus_) [and camels]. Most
of the deaths were localized in the Nkaroni area just west of Wamba town.
The diagnosis of anthrax was rapidly confirmed by bacteriological methods.
The relevant government departments, including the Kenya Wildlife Service
and Veterinary Department, and other stakeholders were promptly informed.

53 Grevy's zebra and 26 plains zebras died from anthrax. An equal number
(18) of adult male and female Grevy's zebras succumbed to the disease [and
12 juvenile and infant Grevy's]. The outbreak affected immature and mature
individuals equally. [sic: 36 adults vs. 12 younger?; and only 8,
presumably adults, were confirmed through laboratory examination. Infant
animals tend to die from starvation when their mothers die. The age
categories and sexes of 5 carcasses could not be determined. - Mod.MHJ] The
dead plain zebras included 15 adult females, 2 adult males and 9 immature
individuals. The Veterinary Department responded by vaccinating livestock,
while Kenya Wildlife Service vaccinated 620 Grevy's zebras within southern
Samburu.

Examination of sites at which carcasses of animals that succumbed to the
disease were burnt revealed that unsupervised burning did not eliminate
anthrax spores in 42 percent of the cases (n=14). There is an urgent need
to incorporate strategic wildlife disease monitoring in the struggle to
save Grevy's zebras and other endangered species.

[The authors are to be congratulated on this paper and the hard work in the
field that it represents. They recovered spores from 6/14 burn samples but
none from the (14) soil and (4) water samples. As carcasses tend to wander
after death thanks to scavengers, it is not surprising that the soil
samples were negative.

Burning a carcass takes more skill than many appreciate, as it is necessary
to get the carcass up off the ground so that air can get in underneath.
Otherwise, it is a 3 day job if you are depending on wood piled on top. I
have not infrequently found maggots happily feeding under a partially burnt
carcass.

While zebras are subject to anthrax, they are not all that commonly
afflicted in Africa if the literature is correct. I suspect that this is
because they are primarily grassland grazers and not scrub and brush
browsers like kudu, which seem to be the preferred target species in many
African parks. From the published map, the distribution of this epidemic
was determined by the zebras. The February 2006 reports had the authorities
planning to vaccinate 1500 zebras, but 620 is still no mean feat and will
have done some good.

The following is quoted from:
<http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=3045&art_id=nw20070905231302283C550386>:


"Fewer than 2000 Grevy's zebras are believed to live in the wild. About
1800 live near sprawling plains in and around Kenya's central Samburu
National Reserve, about 230 km north of Nairobi, and the rest in southern
Ethiopia. Conservationists say the Grevy's zebra population has decreased
from 15 000 across the eastern Africa region in 1970 to less than 2000 that
currently live only in arid habitats in northern Kenya and Ethiopia. In
addition to those living in the wild in east Africa, about 220 Grevy's
zebras are housed in zoos around the world.

"Poaching for meat and their valuable hide have decimated populations in
Eritrea, Djibouti and western Somalia. While the zebras are prey for lions,
cheetahs and hyenas, their population was hit hardest by hunting due to the
demand in the fashion world for the animals' striking black-and-white hides."

The last statement should raise some caution flags for customs officials,
as it is not at all impossible that a number of these Kenyan Grevy's may
have been skinned after dying from anthrax, and their valuable and striking
but contaminated hides will wend their way out of Africa into the rich
international markets. - Mod.MHJ]
