SALISBURY -- Another horse in Worcester County has succumbed to eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE), raising the county's death count to 3 horses,
the state Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported on Tuesday. The
test results confirmed suspicions that the horse's death last week in
Whaleyville was caused by the mosquitoborne virus.
On Friday, health officials also reported that EEE was detected in
mosquitoes collected from a swamp in the same town where the horse was
infected. In response to the latest outbreak, the state Department of
Agriculture conducted an aerial spraying mission last night over the
Pocomoke River Swamp in Wicomico and Worcester counties. "It has always
been one of the mosquito hot spots on the Eastern Shore. In the early 1900s
there were reports of horse deaths here," said Cyrus Lesser, chief of the
Eastern Shore mosquito control program for the Department of Agriculture.
Last week, a horse in Caroline County died of West Nile virus, only the
second equine fatality ever reported on the Eastern Shore. This year there
have been 203 human cases of West Nile [virus infection] in the United
States, 5 of which were fatal, according to the national Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1964, there have been only 153 US
cases of EEE, but 7 of those have occurred this year.
A case of EEE usually begins with a dark swamp mosquito that feeds
exclusively on wild birds, which in turn transmits the virus to mosquitoes
that feed on horses or humans. Ted Mollett, an animal science professor at
the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, said a likely explanation for the
increase in EEE was damp spring and summer conditions, which has led to a
proliferation of mosquitoes. "It's speculation, but it's possible that next
year there could be more birds carrying the virus. But if there are fewer
mosquitoes, there could be fewer infections," Mollett said.
Chickens, pheasants, turkeys, and ducks also can be infected with EEE,
though they are affected differently. "The good news for chickens is that
they seldom show signs of infection.Domestic birds, such as pheasants, are
quite susceptible, though," he said.
The outbreak of EEE is the first in Worcester County since 1989, which is
the last time the county's swamps were sprayed, Lesser said.
