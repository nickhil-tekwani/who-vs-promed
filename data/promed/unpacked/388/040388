Diseases threaten cattle of Blue Nile refugee
---------------------------------------------
Refugees at Jammam and Yusif Batil camps in Maban County of Upper Nile state complained of outbreaks of disease among their cattle and a lack of drugs for animal diseases.

Samani Agar, sultan of the Ingessana tribes from Blue Nile, told Radio Tamazuj from a refugee camp in Upper Nile state of South Sudan that there are fears amid Blue Nile refugees of the loss of their livestock because of the outbreaks of disease within the herds of cows and sheep. He said thousands could die because of outbreaks of multiple diseases, some of which are unknown.

He pointed out that the refugees are depending on cattle and sheep to bridge the shortfall in aid provided to them by the international organizations, but the diseases are now the major threat to their wealth, while animal drugs are lacking in the camps.

In addition to that Agar reveled the deaths of thousands of cattle because of the diseases, saying that Ingessana tribes used to depend entirely on livestock and after the conflicts in Blue Nile most of them lost their cattle, and fled in search of security to Upper Nile.

Agar added that there are great fears of complete loss of cattle and he appealed to the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries in Upper Nile state and the Red Cross to provide medicines for livestock.
