I read with interest your report on Typhus, Epidemic - Burundi
(South-West). The causative agent of epidemic typhus, _ Rickettsia
prowazekii_ of the family Rickettsiaceae, is by all definitions a
bacterium and not a bacterium-like organism. The typhus organism is
an obligate intracellular bacterium, but still a "full fledged"
bacterium. In contrast, the typhoid organism_Salmonella typhi_ is
essentially a free living bacterium that belongs to the
Enterobacteriaceae family. This organism additionally, can be a
facultative intracellular organism (still a matter of debate).
