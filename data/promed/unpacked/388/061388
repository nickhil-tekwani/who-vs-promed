Re the message dated 6 Jan 1999 from a news agency via George A. Robertson
on African Plague, Pigs -Madagascar:
African Swine Fever has been diagnosed in Madagascar in December 1998
(ELISA Ab: ASF+ ; PCR: ASF+ ; sequencing of the amplified fragment: ASFv).
OIE and FAO have been notified. We can notice that Classical Swine Fever is
also prevalent since several decades in Madagascar and controlled by
vaccination.
[ELISA = enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay, a serological test; PCR =
polymerase chain reaction, a biomolecular test - Mod.JW
The first cases of ASF occurred probably in the south of Madagascar some
months ago. We can consider that almost 7/8 of the total pig population is
in the infected areas; the north seems for the moment free of ASF (in 1996,
the total pig herd counted 800 000 - 900 000 animals). Roughly 50% of the
population in infected areas "disappeared" (dead or sold during outbreak).
Acute cases of ASF are recorded, most of the time first in adults. There is
neither treatment nor vaccine and only sanitary measures could restrain the
spread of this disease. The Official Veterinary Services of
Madagascar is taking means of control and is informing the mass media.
There is no plan to slaughter animals on a large scale for the moment.
There is in Madagascar an important population of _Potamochoerus_ [wild
boar and the Argasid tick species _Ornithodoros moubata_ is also [there.
If it is a virus coming from abroad, the possible entrance place is the
deep south, possibly at the level of the harbours. To investigate that
matter, we have the intention to initiate molecular epidemiology studies.
We would like to know the state of the research on ASF vaccine.

In response to your report of 8 January: we have heard that African swine
fever has been confirmed in Madagascar by a laboratory in France. There is
no vaccine and no treatment for this disease. The only known way to control
it is by slaughter of all infected and in-contact pigs, but doing this
without compensation does tend to
encourage spread of the disease by clandestine movements of pigs and pork.
Recent experiences in West Africa with this disease have been rather
discouraging.
We will be interested to receive any further reports of the situation in
Madagascar.
