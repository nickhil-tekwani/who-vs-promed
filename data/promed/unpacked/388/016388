Suspected case definition for Asokore Mampong outbreak [outbreak in students at the Kumasi Academy, which is located in Asokore Mampong, a suburb of the city of Kumasi] and other matters
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I write to update you on what is happening and the working suspected case definition we should be using to find more cases.
Based on the symptoms reported and signs elicited so far, we can deduce that:
1. The disease has a short incubation period of about 0-2 days
2. The disease has a high fatality
3. The disease is transmitted from person to person
A suspected case therefore has been defined as anyone presenting with fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C [100.4 F]) headache, muscle pain, with or without any of the following:
- Cough
- Bleeding
- Diarrhoea
- Vomiting
- Stiff neck

Please use this case definition to find more cases and do well to separate them from other cases for infection control. Taking detailed history (which should include details of recent travel outside school, visitors received, contacts with other cases, etc) and doing full physical examination is still imperative. Take appropriate laboratory samples, which may include:
- Malaria RDT [Rapid Diagnostic Test]
- CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] Microscopy for Meningitis
- CSF Culture for meningitis
- PCR for meningitis
- Throat swab for Influenza
- Blood for VHF [viral hemorrhagic fever]
- Full blood count

Update on Kamaka [Kamasi Academy] outbreak
------------------------------------------
1. A total of 46 students so far have been admitted in health facilities in the metropolis with KNUST hospital admitting the majority. KATH [Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital] has so far admitted 6 cases.

2. In all there have been 4 mortalities.

3. The major symptoms have been fever, headache and cough followed by vomiting, diarrhoea and neck pain.

4. CSF latex agglutination tests, culture and PCR have not identified any organism yet. Tests were done in KATH, KCCR [Kumasi Center for Collaborative Research in Tropical Medicine] and Reference Lab in Tamale [Tamale is the capital city of the Northern Region].

5. Tests done at Noguchi [a medical research institute at the University of Ghana in Accra] so [far] for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Dengue have [been] negative. KCCR has also done some viral screens, none of which has been positive. I don't have details on all tests done at KCCR but will ask the details from the Regional health directorate. We are awaiting results from about 19 throat swabs sent to KCCR for PCR.

6. Regarding the antibiotic prophylaxis [azithromycin], the decision was made because the cases respond quite rapidly to antibiotics and so the thinking is that it could be bacterial.

7. The decision was held off for a while with the hope that all the numerous tests being done would yield some results but so far everything has been negative.

8. This is an emergency for all and multidisciplinary collaboration is what is needed. We are trying to get the clinical details of all the cases for a meeting being convened tomorrow [Sat 9 Dec 2017] for some clinicians, Microbiology, Pathology, public health and other disciplines to deliberate on what the picture points to and what else can be done in terms of investigations, clinical management, etc.
