Continuing importation of falciparum malaria from Goa into Europe
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A case of falciparum malaria acquired in Goa, India, has recently been
reported to the European Network on Imported Infectious Disease
Surveillance (TropNetEurop, <http://www.tropnet.net>).

The report relates to a Swedish woman in her 50s who had spent 2 weeks in
Goa (Candolim beach) and Kerala in India without taking malaria
chemoprophylaxis [ProMED: "Malaria, falciparum - EU ex India (Goa): Sweden
20080124.0294"]. In mid-December 2007, about 2 weeks after returning to
Sweden, she fell ill with fever and a mild cough. Then, 10 days after the
onset of symptoms, thick and thin films were done and an infection with
_Plasmodium falciparum_ with a parasitaemia of 1.8 per cent was diagnosed.
The patient was admitted to hospital, treated uneventfully with a standard
dose of mefloquine, and discharged 4 days later.

This case report provides more evidence of the continuing risk of
falciparum malaria infection in Goa. A popular winter resort for European
tourists, Goa was until last year [2007] considered an area of very low
risk of malaria infection for travellers. During the 2006-7 winter season,
however, 8 cases of _P. falciparum_ infestation among tourists returning
from Goa were reported to TropNetEurop, whereas in the previous 2 years
there had been no reports of malaria in European travellers to this area
[1]. An increased incidence among the indigenous population was also
confirmed by local authorities.

Since December 2006, 19 malaria cases imported from India have been
reported, among which 13 were explicitly identified as coming from Goa. The
cluster of 8 cases reported in the winter of 2006-7 coincided with a period
of intense rainfall (50 per cent above average) in the Goan and Konokan
region, which had begun in October 2006 [2]. But reports of malaria cases
imported from Goa have continued despite changes in the season and the
amount of rainfall. Since last winter, 5 more cases have been reported over
a period of several months, including the most recent one described above.

It appears that there may be a continuously increased risk of malaria
transmission. TropNetEurop has therefore been recommending malaria
chemoprophylaxis to all travellers to Goa since 2007 [3].

All tourists who intend to visit this region of India are also advised to
use mosquito bite avoidance measures. Visitors may consider using the World
Health Organization's type IV prevention [4], which is mosquito bite
prevention plus chemoprophylaxis with atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline, or
mefloquine, or they may consider travelling with emergency standby
treatment. Anyone who becomes unwell while on holiday or shortly after
their return should seek immediate medical attention. Falciparum malaria
can be a life-threatening illness. The diagnosis can only be made if a
careful travel history is taken, and testing done early, even for regions
where malaria is not normally recognised.
