Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics; as of Mon 3 Feb 2003
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health issued on Mon 3 Feb 2003 the latest information
about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This
includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or CJD (new var.)] -- the form of the disease thought
to be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as
follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Referrals of suspect CJD / Deaths of definite and probable CJD
Year / Referrals / Sporadic / Iatrogenic / Familial / GSS / vCJD / Total
deaths
1990 / 53 / 28 / 5 / 0 / 0 / - / 33
1991 / 75 / 32 / 1 / 3 / 0 / - / 36

2003*/ 12 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 1
Total/1641 /615 /40 /35 /19/ 122 /831
(*Provisional; as of Mon 3 Feb 2003)
Summary of vCJD cases
Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 94
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 27
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 122
Alive:
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 8
Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 130
The precise definitions of the terms: referrals, deaths, definite cases,
probable vCJD cases, sporadic, probable sporadic, iatrogenic, familial,
GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health website or by reference to a preceding ProMED-mail
post in this thread [CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693].
The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 3 March 2003.

[Since the previous monthly statistics released by the Department of Health
on Mon 6 Jan 2003, the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases
(dead and alive) has increased by one, and the number of deaths by one. In
view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments in mice
that: "Some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have
a disease arising from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible association with
BSE 20021129.5921), the figures for sporadic CJD cases now have added
significance in relation to the course of the vCJD outbreak. Since Mon 6
Jan 2003 the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD has increased by 8.
The global total of definite or probable vCJD cases now stands at 141. In
addition to the 130 UK cases, there have been 6 cases in France, and one
each in Canada, the Hong Kong SAR, the Irish Republic, Italy, and the
United States. The patients in Canada, Hong Kong SAR, and the United States
had all spent long periods in the UK during the peak of the BSE outbreak
and are presumed to have contracted vCJD while in the UK. (It is unclear
whether any of these former UK residents have been included in the figures
compiled by the UK Department of Health). Also, 3 of the French cases may
have spent periods of time in the UK. Reports of vCJD cases in Guadeloupe,
Norway, Russia, and South Africa have not been confirmed.
Reuters Health Information, in an article by Alicia Ault, reported that a
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) official told a federal
scientific advisory panel on Tue 21 Jan 2003 that through the fall of 2002
there had been no reported cases of vCJD disease in the United States,
despite rising concerns about widening human exposure to mad cow-like
diseases in elk and deer.
<http://www.reutershealth.com/archive/2003/01/21/eline/links/20030121elin037.html>)
The 10-member Committee on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSEs)
at the Institute of Medicine (IOM) was meeting to discuss the latest
surveillance figures and scientific advances on vCJD. It was the third of 4
meetings being held by the TSE panel to gather data that will form
recommendations on how to better detect the disease and to create
diagnostics and treatments for the condition. The committee's
recommendations should be issued later in 2003. Dr Ermias Belay of CDC told
the panel that since 1996, when the agency began heightened surveillance,
there have been no cases of vCJD in any US citizen. In October 2002, CDC
reported one case of vCJD in a young Florida woman, but she was born and
had grown up in the UK, said Dr Belay. That woman is still alive, 14 months
after her diagnosis, he noted.
CDC is renewing surveillance efforts with the rise of chronic wasting
disease (CWD), a TSE initially identified in free-ranging and farmed elk
and deer in a few western states. CWD is spreading, however. In the past 2
years, CWD has been identified in wild deer in Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Illinois, and most recently, southern New Mexico. While there have been no
documented cases, it is theoretically possible that CWD could jump into
humans. CDC has asked Wyoming and Colorado to track whether hunters in
those states are dying of CJD or suspected CJD. Since CWD has been in that
region for more than 20 years, the disease, which takes years to develop,
would start showing up now. But, he said, hunting organizations have
resisted taking part because states will need personal identifying data to
match with death records.
To get more clues about vCJD in the US, CDC is encouraging more brain
autopsies of people who have died of suspected CJD. Dr Belay said initial
surveys show reluctance and outright refusal by the majority of US
pathologists, who are concerned that tissue from patients will contaminate
their instruments. - Mod.CP]
