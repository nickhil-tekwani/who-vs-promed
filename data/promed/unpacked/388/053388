Activists Catch Doctors Fleeing Mystery Fever
---------------------------------------------
NEW DELHI: Activists are camping at an airport and railway stations to stop
government doctors from fleeing a remote area of India where a mysterious
disease has killed 42 people. Among the dead in the backward northern
region of West Bengal state are 2 doctors and 4 nurses who were reportedly
infected by patients under their treatment.
Reports say volunteers caught several doctors at the Bagdogra airport, New
Jalpaiguri railway station and long-distance bus termini and brought them
back to Silguri town, the "epicentre" of the killer fever. The epidemic has
spread to Naxalbari, Dinajpur and other far-flung rural areas, where people
are dying of an unknown fever with body temperatures suddenly shooting up
to 40.5 degrees Celsius. Some victims have swollen heads and all
antibiotics have proved ineffective. According to unofficial estimates, the
toll has exceeded 100 since last week, although the West Bengal Government
has admitted only 42 deaths so far.
Groups forcibly stopped a team of experts from Calcutta's School of
Tropical Medicine and New Delhi's National Institute of Communicable
Diseases which visited Silguri from leaving the area. "They can't go back
to Calcutta or New Delhi until they diagnose the disease correctly and
prescribe drugs to cure it," a spokesman for the Silguri Welfare
Association told The Telegraph newspaper. A World Health Organisation team
is scheduled to arrive in Silguri today to assess the situation. The
citizens' body has warned 12 Silguri doctors who managed to escape that
they will not be allowed to practise in the town again. "Doctors who have
deserted us at this crucial juncture will not be allowed to set foot in
Silguri again," the spokesman said. "They return at their own risk."
But a leading doctor, J.C. Gandhi, accused the state administration of not
supplying protective gowns, gloves and masks to doctors and nurses fighting
the epidemic. He said doctors had sacrificed their lives and yet they were
being targeted as villains. State Health Minister Partha De yesterday
appealed to doctors not to panic or run away but to do their best in the
"daunting circumstances." "We will send sufficient protective gear and
medicines by helicopter," Mr. De said in the state capital, Calcutta. He
said that samples collected from dead people had been sent to laboratories
in Pune and New Delhi and the findings were expected by the end of the week.
Angry locals have held several demonstrations protesting against alleged
government apathy and burned effigies of Mr. De and Chief Minister
Buddhadev Bhattacharya. Mr. Bhattacharya announced that he would visit
Silguri, but cancelled the trip fearing violent protests. Mr. De has
criticised a move by Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who belongs to the opposition
Trinamul Congress Party, to subject people arriving by train from the
epidemic-affected areas to stringent medical check-ups before allowing them
to enter Calcutta. "Such antics will only worsen the situation," Mr. De
warned. But Mr. Mukherjee has posted a 15-member medical team at Calcutta's
Howrah and Sealdah railway stations to screen passengers from the northern
region. Meanwhile, the Government has rejected an appeal by panic-stricken
residents to postpone higher secondary school exams, the equivalent of O
Levels, in the northern region.

Fever Provisionally Diagnosed as Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
--------------------------------------------------------------
SILIGURI: Medical experts on Tue 27 Feb 2001 appeared to be close to
identifying the mystery disease which has claimed more than 36 lives here
this month, with an equal number of patients being under treatment, with
heavy doses of antibiotics [which reportedly have included tetracycline,
rifampicin, azythromycin, quinine hydrochloride, ceftriaxone injections and
cyclovir. Meanwhile, no deaths have been reported here in the last 48
hours, although 2 more persons suffering from the undiagnosed fever have
been admitted to hospital.
Dr. Devadasan from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Dr. Harit from
the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), who remained in
Siliguri after other experts have left, indicated that the pathogen might
have been short-listed successfully as [the Hantavirus known as Sin Nombre
virus. However, Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) has been recognized as
a disease only recently in North [and South America and is still rather
uncommon with chances of infection being rather low. But HPS is potentially
deadly and immediate intensive care is essential once its symptoms appear.
While HPS affects the pulmonary system, at Siliguri, it appears to have
struck the nervous system and neural tissues before affecting the pulmonary
tissues.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta in the US
describes the symptoms as follows: "The first signs of sickness (especially
fever and muscle aches) appear one to 5 weeks later, followed by shortness
of breath and coughing. Once this phase begins, the disease progresses
rapidly, necessitating hospitalization and often ventilation within 24
hours." Dr. Harit added: "The prodromal period of these [infections exists
for 3 to 5 days from the time of infection. Cough and shortness of breath
generally develop by the seventh day. Once the cardio-pulmonary phase
begins, the disease progresses rapidly and hospitalization is generally
required within 24 hours. But it is not very contagious and virulence is
not as great as seen in Siliguri."
The 2 experts hope to receive a positive report from the US by Friday, when
they will be also in a position to advise on the drugs to be taken.
Meanwhile, no death has been reported in Siliguri during the last 48 hours
although 2 more persons with similar symptoms, including one more member of
the nursing staff of the Medinova Nursing Home, were admitted to the
hospital on Wednesday. [At the Medinova nursing home, suspected to be the
centre of the outbreak, about 14 staff have died -- yet no post-mortems
have been done, according to the Times of India, 26 Feb 2001.

[An earlier report suggested the cases may be due to cerebral malaria, but
this would be easily diagnosed in any Indian hospital laboratory. This
report does not say if the symptoms of the Siliguri patients match those of
HPS. Earlier reports speak of encephalitis, "cardio respiratory failure and
encephalitis," "pupil dilation, myoclonic jerk and convulsion, headache
with fever up to 41 deg. Celsius. The patient gets under deep coma within 2
days of the fever," and one case of "fever, headache and vomiting of
blood." It sounds as though no clear case definition has been established.
However, at least one strain of hantavirus is known to have been
transmitted person-to-person in a hospital setting, which would account for
the cases seen in hospital staff here. - Mod.JW
