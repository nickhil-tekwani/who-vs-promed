I agree with the comments of Ralph Elston that significant mortality in
oyster culture is not uncommon, and that in the absence of well-designed
and timely scientific research programs all sorts of speculative factors
are proposed as the cause. It is also not uncommon that many involved (from
industry members to fisheries officers and researchers) seize an
explanation that appears appropriate (whether disease event or change in
environmental parameters, or a concatenation of the two) even though no
supporting data may exist. The obvious danger is that this can lead to
misinterpretation and results in a plethora of anecdotal reports which mask
the true epizootiology of the etiological agents which may be involved.
In the case of QX disease, media reports seem to focus on the acronym QX
meaning 'Queensland' and 'Unknown agent', but given that the parasite was
described by Perkins and Wolf in 1976, the acronym, although a useful and
unambiguous descriptor, is no longer literally accurate. Nonetheless, press
releases abound with references to a 'mystery bug' and 'little is known'
when the reality is that we have a wealth of information supported by
robust data on the organism's identity and pathology. Similarly the
epizootiology is well known in terms of seasonal [patterns of infection,
likely geographic range and course of infection in the oyster. The main gap
in our knowledge is, as with all species within the phylum _Paramyxea_, the
stages of the disease which occur outside of the oyster host and most
likely involve an alternate host. This is currently the focus of our
research team (myself, Prof. Bob Lester and our postgraduate students) and
will continue to attract our efforts.
