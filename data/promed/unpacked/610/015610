Outbreak of avian influenza among birds in Mongolia's Arkhangai Aimag
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Mongolia's Emergency Situations Agency announced today [25 May 2009] that,
on 22 May, swans had died of unknown cause in Ogii Nuur Lake, in the
Arkhangai Aimag [see commentary]. After analysis, the Mongolian National
Livestock Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Center announced on [24
May 2009] that the swans died due to infection by H5N1 avian influenza. On
24 May [2009], the governor of Arkhangai Aimag ordered closure of the
outbreak area.

[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Mongolia is available at
<http://healthmap.org/r/00di>. Arkhangai ("Northern Khangai") is one of the
21 aimags (provinces) of Mongolia. It is located slightly west to the
country's center, on the northern slopes of the Khangai Mountains (see map
at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_mn_arkhangai_aimag.png>.) The
small Ogii Nuur Lake is located in the eastern part of the aimag, in the
sum (district) of the same name (see map at
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Mongolia_Arkhangai_sum_map.png>.)

The reported outbreak of HPAI H5N1 in wild swans in Mongolia follows
China's notification of 17 May 2009 of an outbreak in "wild migratory"
birds (no species identification available), reportedly detected in Qinghai
on 8 May 2009 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090518.1869]. Remarkably, a
rather similar scenario was seen in these territories in 2005 [see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20070828.2815].

During late April-June 2005, an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 infection occurred
among wild birds at Qinghai Lake in China. First identified in bar headed
geese (_Anser indicus_), the disease soon spread to other avian species
populating the lake. At the beginning of August 2005, the Mongolian
authorities reported an outbreak in wild birds in Erhel lake, Alag-Ederne
county, Huvsgel province, affecting wild ducks, geese and swans. According
to a 2007 Chinese paper (ref 1), sequence analysis of 15 viruses from 6
avian species and collected at different times during the 2005 outbreak
revealed 4 different H5N1 genotypes. Importantly, H5N1 viruses isolated in
Mongolia, Russia, and Inner Mongolia were genetically closely related to
one of the genotypes isolated during the Qinghai outbreak. As noted by the
authors, this genotype virus also spread to some countries in Europe and
Africa, suggesting its dominant nature.

The distance between Qinghai (China) and Arkhangai (Mongolia) exceeds 1500
km (932 mi).

The current co-circulation in China of both type A influenza viruses,
namely the highly pathogenic H5N1 and the novel, human-adapted A (H1N1), is
a matter of concern, particularly in view of China's huge pig ("mixing
vessel") population (see [1] in ProMED-mail archive 20090509.1733).
