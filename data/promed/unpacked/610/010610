[Location of FMD outbreaks is a critical factor in understanding the
potential economic impact of an outbreak in Botswana. Livestock and
meat exports to Europe is the major non-mineral related factor in
making Botswana one of the highest economic growth countries in the
world, at 9 percent per annum (although the lion's share of GDP is
related to diamonds and other minerals). So, whenever there is an
outbreak of FMD that can threaten the meat export market, a great
deal of concern ensues.

Fortunately, in this case, FMD has occurred in the "right" place,
i.e. in a vaccination zone rather than an FMD-free zone. The outbreak
is near the Okvango Swamp and separated by a good distance from the
FMD free zones in the southern and eastern parts of the country. For
a map of the zones, please see the FAO/EMPRES Bulletin of Feb - June
2005,
<ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a0115e/a0115e01.pdf>.

For a map of the outbreak, please see Healthmap's very interesting
global mapping program at
<http://healthmap.org/promed?v=-22.2,23.8,5>,
and don't forget to zoom in. The outbreak location can also be seen
by referencing the OIE report given above. - Mod.PC]
