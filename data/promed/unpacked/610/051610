===============================

From: Ak Infection Control <AkInfect@ahsl.co.nz>

We are the Infection Control Nurse Practitioners for Auckland Healthcare in
New Zealand, which covers approx. 1200 beds in four hospitals and community
centers.
MRSA: The major resistance pattern we see is only MRSA (approx. 1% of
all isolates).
VRE: To our knowledge there has only been one case of VRE in
the whole of New Zealand
MDR Tb: thus far no totally MDR Tb.
We do not have access to the Internet, only to e-mail facilities.
