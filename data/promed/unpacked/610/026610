[The case fatality rate, where both total cases and numbers of deaths are provided, is extremely high. Either the total case count is too low, or deaths are due to other factors. The situation in the Darfur states over the past 2 months has been confused. Significant numbers of deaths have been attributed to an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever. Other deaths have been attributed to West Nile virus infections. In the above report, severe dengue is reported as the cause of many deaths.

[2] Transmission from asymptomatic people
Date: Mon 9 Nov 2015
Source: PNAS Early edition doi: 10.1073/pnas.1508114112 [edited]
http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/04/1508114112.abstract?sid=4044c18b-da2c-4750-9711-13fe93e7ab6b


Veasna Duong, Louis Lambrechts, Richard E. Paul, Sowath Ly, Rath Srey Lay, Kanya C. Long, Rekol Huy, Arnaud Tarantola, Thomas W. Scott, Anavaj Sakuntabhai, and Philippe Buchy. Asymptomatic humans transmit dengue virus to mosquitoes.

Significance
Our work provides evidence that people who are infected with dengue virus without developing detectable clinical symptoms or prior to the onset of symptoms are infectious to mosquitoes. At a given level of viremia, symptom-free people were markedly more infectious to mosquitoes than clinically symptomatic patients. Our results fundamentally change the current paradigm for dengue epidemiology and control, based on detection of dengue virus-infected cases with apparent illness.

Abstract
3/4th of the estimated 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections each year are clinically inapparent. People with inapparent dengue virus infections are generally considered dead-end hosts for transmission because they do not reach sufficiently high viremia levels to infect mosquitoes. Here, we show that, despite their lower average level of viremia, asymptomatic people can be infectious to mosquitoes. Moreover, at a given level of viremia, DENV-infected people with no detectable symptoms or before the onset of symptoms are significantly more infectious to mosquitoes than people with symptomatic infections. Because DENV viremic people without clinical symptoms may be exposed to more mosquitoes through their undisrupted daily routines than sick people and represent the bulk of DENV infections, our data indicate that they have the potential to contribute significantly more to virus transmission to mosquitoes than previously recognized.

[These findings change the usual concept of when dengue virus infected individuals can provide infectious blood meals for vector mosquitoes. The reason that more mosquitoes that feed on asymptomatic individuals become infected and able to transmit more than those that feed on symptomatic individuals is not clear. - Mod.TY]
