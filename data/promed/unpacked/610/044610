Vaccination applied in Kuban following an outbreak of avian flu in wild birds
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In connection with the suspected outbreak of avian influenza in wild birds in the Temryuk district of Krasnodar region [Kuban; see commentary], veterinarians will carry out vaccination of poultry.

As reported by YuGA.ru, about 1000 dead birds have been found on the shores of the Black Sea and Azov sea. According to preliminary data, the birds have died of bird flu [confirmed in the meantime; see item 2].

"Poultry will be vaccinated within the so-called endangered zone, although we have not imposed quarantine," the deputy head of the district administration of Rosselkhoznadzor, Alexander Malakhov, told RIA Novosti.

Also, according to the deputy chief of the department, because of the outbreak in the wild birds, inspections are to be carried out on poultry farms in Kuban. "We will double-check their compliance with the law," he said. He also added that the monitoring will include shooting birds in the region, "to check whether the virus is circulating."

According to Malakhov, avian flu has not been present in the region since 2006. He did not rule out the possibility that the virus at this time was in the region due to the seasonal migration of wild birds.

Bird flu kills 4000 wild ducks in Russia: official
-----------------------------------------------------
Around 4000 wild ducks have been found dead in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, officials said on Friday 30 Nov 2012, blaming H5 bird flu for the mass deaths.

"This is the H5 virus, the strain is being confirmed," a spokeswoman for the Krasnodar region branch of Russian agriculture watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor told AFP. The birds' remains were now being tested, she added.

The dead birds have been found on lakes near the Black Sea resort town of Anapa. The region has gone on high alert, with poultry and humans [see comment] now being vaccinated.

"All of these are protective measures, it's better to be on the safe side," the spokeswoman added.

[We are grateful to the communicator, Gert van der Hoek, FluTrackers, for both reports and for his added information: "Other reports mention additional affected wild bird species, like coots and swans."

The vaccination of humans, referred to in the above report, deserves to be clarified. Animal H5N1 vaccines are commercially available and in wide use in several countries. Though some H5N1 vaccines for humans have been developed or are under testing, to the best of our knowledge they have not been certified and/or not (yet) available on the (civilian) market, for general public use.

The Krasnodar Territory administrative division in southeastern European Russia, extends from the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea into the Kuban steppe and straddles the northwestern end of the Greater Caucasus. For a map of the Kuban region, sometimes referred to as Krasnodar, see map at http://tinyurl.com/c4u9d3m.

Anapa is a seaport town in the Krasnodar Region in southwest Russia. It is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea near the Sea of Azov (map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/RS/38/Anapa.html).

An administrative map of Russia is available at http://www.eegas.com/images/11-legend.gif (Krasnodar at the south-west).

H5N1 outbreak, involving wild birds and domestic poultry, was last recorded in the region in January 2007. The Azov Sea basin is situated on a main flyway of various species of migrating birds. - Mod.AS]
