Federal wildlife officials said Monday [9 Sep 2019] that the deaths of thousands of seabirds in western Alaska this summer was because of starvation, as they investigate a 5th straight year of unusually high numbers of seabird fatalities amid warm sea surface temperatures.

Thousands of short-tailed shearwaters were reported dead and washing onto beaches in the Bristol Bay region starting in late June [2019], the National Park Service said in a statement on Monday [9 Sep 2019]

As the summer continued, the deaths of the dark-colored birds extended to the Chukchi Sea off Northwest Alaska.

"Initial results indicate starvation as the cause of death for most locations," said the agency, which is working with the US Fish and Wildlife Service to track the deaths. "Puffins, murres, and auklets are also being reported, but at much lower numbers than shearwaters."

Seabird die-offs have been known to occur in Alaska, but large numbers of different varieties of seabirds have been found every year since 2015, with starvation blamed. The die-offs have come as Alaska waters continue to be warmer than normal, the NPS says, potentially impacting sea life the birds eat.

In southeast Alaska, the agencies blamed a "localized die off" of breeding arctic terns in June [2019] on exposure to saxitoxin, a biotoxin associated with paralytic shellfish poisoning.

"Analyses of tissue samples for harmful algal bloom toxins are ongoing, and results will be shared as they become available. To date, there has been no evidence of disease," the statement said.

[Large die-offs of seabirds, especially murres, have been linked to strong "El nino" events in the past. In 1993, after a prolonged series of high temperature anomalies in the Tropical Pacific, thousands of murres were found dead with signs of emaciation in the Gulf of Alaska (Piatt JF, Van Pelt TI: Mass-mortality of guillemots (_Uria aalge_) in the Gulf of Alaska in 1993. Marine Pollution Bulletin. 1997; 34(8): 656-662. Abstract available at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0025-326X(97)00008-8).

In the 2013-2014 winter, sea surface temperature showed positive anomalies from Baja California to Alaska. Because of its extension and the magnitude of its impacts on climate and fisheries, this anomaly was named the "warm blob." This anomaly had important effect on the ecological dynamics of the northern Pacific Ocean, including its trophic webs. Sea water temperature-monitoring systems are showing that the warm blob is back (https://www.sciencealert.com/gigantic-heatwave-brewing-in-the-pacific-threatens-a-return-of-the-blob), which could result in further disruption of the ecosystem health.

The short-tailed shearwater (_Ardenna tenuirostris_) is a sea bird in the order Procellariiformes (together with albatrosses and petrels). It breeds in Oceania and migrates to the northern Pacific during the boreal summer. It feeds primarily on fish.
