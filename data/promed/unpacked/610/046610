We would like to follow up on an earlier post regarding "Conjunctivitis - Thailand" (please refer to ProMED-mail archive no. 20140903.2746516). Coxsackievirus A24 is an etiologic agent.

The Department of Disease Control, a division of the Thai Ministry of Public Health, recently reported that the number of pink eye (conjunctivitis) patients (from 1 Jan-1 Sep 2014) has increased to 160 906 cases from all 77 provinces of Thailand. The estimated attack rate was 253 per 100 000 in the overall population. Most cases were between the ages of 35-45 (12.4 per cent), followed by cases in the age groups 45-54 and 25-34. The 5 provinces in Thailand with the highest rate are Ubon Ratchathani (827 cases per 100 000), followed by Ranong, Amnat Charoen, Pattani, and Phatthalung. Ubon Ratchathani and Amnat Charoen are contiguous provinces located in the northeast, while the remaining 3 are southern provinces.

The etiologic agent(s) for these large outbreaks have not been well defined. We therefore obtained several eye swab samples from patients with conjunctivitis and analyzed them by PCR for adenoviruses and for pan-enterovirus RT-PCR. Sequence comparisons using BLAST revealed high identity to enterovirus. Further analysis found that most of our samples examined contained sequences from coxsackievirus A24.

Conjunctivitis caused by viruses can be extremely contagious. Common viral agents are of the adenovirus, enterovirus, and coxsackievirus species. Infections are common during the rainy season in Thailand (June-September). In addition to the redness of the transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eyeball (conjunctiva), symptoms may include swelling, irritation, pus and mucus discharge. Outbreaks often are associated with close contact in community settings such as schools, day care, and swimming pools. Although the infection is self-limited, good hand-washing hygiene and avoiding contact and sharing of personal items with infected individuals during the symptomatic phase are important factors in limiting its spread.

In summary, our study to define the etiologic agent responsible for the conjunctivitis outbreak in this epidemic is attributed to a group of enterovirus. The molecular characterization from the sequences found that coxsackievirus A24 was the etiologic agent from this outbreak.

[It is of interest to have the etiological agent in this outbreak identified as coxsackie A24 virus in several of these cases of conjunctivitis. If additional cases are tested, it will be interesting to see if the same virus, or others capable of causing conjunctivitis, are identified. ProMED thanks Yong Poovorawan, MD, and colleagues for sending in this report. The 1st-hand reports from outbreak areas are especially valuable.
