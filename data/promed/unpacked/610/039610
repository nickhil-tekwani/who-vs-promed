The biggest infection of banana bunchy top disease ever found by the National Bunchy Top Project has seen 7500 banana plants destroyed near Nimbin [New South Wales, North Coast region]. The plants were found on an old plantation and were largely covered or surrounded by weed and rainforest growth. Banana bunchy top disease in Australia is restricted to an area in northern NSW and South East Queensland.

Project leader David Peasley said the plants were in clumps scattered in very hilly terrain, and the regrowth made them impossible to identify through aerial photography. "The disease had spread right through the old plantation, and it may have been there for 20 years. It was only discovered as we were suspicious that infections in a commercial plantation must have been blowing in from nearby," he said. "Our suspicions were confirmed when the plants were found, and only a high cliff had stopped any considerable spread of the disease."

"We have made excellent progress controlling bunchy top on commercial plantations in NSW and have had great support from the community in locating infected plants outside of plantations. This find highlights the need for vigilance across the region if we are to ever have the chance of eradicating the disease."

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the type member of the genus _Babuvirus_ (family Nanoviridae) and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia and the Pacific Islands.

BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material or by air currents (as mentioned above). The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools). Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material, and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting or natural cluster of plants is considered impossible, and the only option is to kill off all plants in the group. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

There are 2 groups of BBTV isolates from different regions: the South Pacific group (including Australia, Burundi, Egypt, Fiji, India, Tonga and Western Samoa) and the Asian group (Philippines, Taiwan and Viet Nam). The mean sequence difference between the 2 groups has been reported as approximately 10 per cent (see link below). This is thought to suggest that the virus has spread after the initial movement of its hosts from the Indo-Malaysian region, where edible _Musa_ species originated, to Africa and the Americas.
