Hundreds quizzed over Legionnaires' Outbreak
------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of people diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease have been
questioned as part of an inquiry to investigate the Barrow outbreak, which
killed 5 people this summer. The extensive inquiries are likely to be
published at the beginning of December 2002. Final numbers of people
infected with the pneumonia-type disease will be published in the report by
the Outbreak Control Team.
This figure is likely to exceed the 146 confirmed [cases] as a result of
additional retrospective blood testing carried out in the follow-up clinics
at Furness General Hospital.
Consultant in Health Protection for Cumbria and Lancashire Dr. Nick Gent is
still compiling details for the Outbreak Control Team's report into the
Legionnaires' Disease outbreak. He said: "It's going to be about another 6
weeks before we complete the report. We're still awaiting quite a bit of
follow-up work before we do all the statistics. It will probably be ready
at the beginning of December."
The source of Britain's worst outbreak was traced to Forum 28 in Duke
Street, Barrow, which is owned by the council. Health and Safety experts
discovered the air-conditioning unit had been expelling contaminated vapor
from 2 narrow vents into the alleyway used as a short-cut by up to 1000
people a day.
