A 24 year old woman was taken in an emergency from the City of Coyhaique to the Las Condes Clinic in Santiago as a newly diagnosed hantavirus infection case and is in a serious condition. The young woman, who presented with symptoms including dizziness, was taken to a health facility in the area.

Dr Rodrigo Diaz, program chief of the Las Condes Clinic, stated that the patient seems to have [hantavirus] cardiopulmonary syndrome that led to respiratory failure. The attending physician in the intensive care unit, Andres Raccius, stated that the young woman presented with multiple organ failure and will be under observation in the coming days in hopes of improvement.

There is considerable worry in the Pirque community generated by a confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. According to a municipal communication, the man was working on the El Cardo farm in San Juan. The announcement indicated that, although the exact location where he was infected is unknown, it is requested that maximum precautions be taken in the area between the Cerro de San Juan to Santa Rita.

"For now, we must take all the necessary precautions, such as clearing areas where one is going to camp and airing out sheds and houses in areas near these places," the announcement stated.

[The conditions under which these individuals acquired their hantavirus infections are not stated. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the Aisen and Santiago Metropolitan District regions, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person, and when it is, it is only through very close physical contact, usually within the family. The commonest source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
