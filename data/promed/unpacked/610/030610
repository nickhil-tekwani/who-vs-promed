A 53 year old woman infected with anthrax has been taken to an infectious
diseases hospital in Shymkent (the administrative centre of South
Kazakhstan Region).
The Kazakh Emergencies Ministry told Interfax-Kazakhstan today that the
woman, who was admitted to hospital on Tuesday [21 Jun 2005], was probably
infected with anthrax "when she was selling meat to a private shop".
The ministry said that 2 people who had had contact with the sick woman had
been identified. They are under observation. "Laboratory tests are being
carried out and preventive measures are being taken," the ministry said.

2 men have been admitted to the Shymkent Infectious Hospital (south-central
Kazakhstan) with a preliminary diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax. Infection of
the 1st person took place on 17 Jun 2005 in Shymkent, through purchase of
meat in a market; the 2nd person has infected on 22 Jun 2005 at the
slaughter of [a 2 month old] calf unvaccinated against anthrax.
The results of bacteriological tests for anthrax are negative. Results of
biological tests will be available on 27 Jun and 2 Jul 2005.
In November 2004, 100 per cent of fine and fine horned livestock, 98 per
cent of horses, and 95 per cent of camels were vaccinated. Vaccination of
agricultural animals is now carried out according to the plan [using] a dry
vaccine.

[Thanks to Dr Meka-Mechenko's expert help, we know that they have 3
presumptive cases of human cutaneous anthrax. Southern Kazakhstan is
endemic for this disease. It is not immediately obvious why these cases
occurred, but vaccination cover for anthrax is only about 9 months, and
non-commercial small farm units do get missed by official control
programmes. If the calf's mother had been vaccinated, it would have had
passive/maternal-antibody immunity for some 3 months. The nature of the
contaminated market meat is not described, but it might have been from an
unvaccinated dead sheep or goat. Laboratory confirmation of human cutaneous
cases is difficult, because many people will have self-treated with
antibiotics before being seen by a doctor or arrival at the hospital. At
best it can sometimes be only 30 per cent confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]
