Authorities have euthanized the last 4 wild ponies on a Virginia island that were diagnosed with a fungus-like disease known as "swamp cancer."

The Salisbury Daily Times reports a total of 7 wild Chincoteague ponies have died since October [2018]. Officials announced the most recent deaths of 4 ponies on Friday [28 Dec 2018].

Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company spokeswoman Denise Bowden said in a Facebook post the ponies "received the very best care money could buy" before their caretakers decided to end their suffering.

"Swamp cancer" isn't cancer, but rather pythiosis, caused by an organism similar to fungus. The disease leaves ponies with lesions on their bodies. One of the ponies diagnosed with the disease died in October [2018]. Two others died earlier this month [December 2018].

[This is a nasty disease. Pythiosis, caused by the organism _Pythium insidiosum_, is a distressing and troublesome condition. It does appear as a growth and looks painful and nasty (photos may be seen at https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2015/07/17/effective-treatment-strategy-swamp-cancer-described/).

While a number of treatments have been tried and have had limited success, there does appear to be a treatment out of Texas (see https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/local/pythiosis-in-horses---swamp-cancer/article_b564b962-a65c-11e8-934c-4b882cdd7a43.html). A vaccination is now available and is given in a series of 3 injections on day 1, day 7, and day 21. Studies show good results with the vaccine alone. Antifungal medications have been used in the past for treatment with varied success. Early detection is key, since the smaller the lesion, the easier it is to remove. This is also the case for treatment with the vaccine. If the vaccine is started within the 1st 14 days, the success of treatment is significantly higher.

The other treatment (other than vaccine) appears to be a combination of excision of excessive tissue caused by the agent and a combination of drugs. Healing of pythiosis lesions treated according to this particular regiment may be viewed at https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2015/07/17/effective-treatment-strategy-swamp-cancer-described/. Each horse was given a single intravenous dose with amphotericin B and dimethylsulfoxide in the affected tissue after the excess tissue was surgically removed (as stated according to the above referenced website).

Precisely which of these protocols was being followed is slightly unclear. However, what is important is that the protocol in use on the Chincoteague ponies appeared to be working successfully, according to the previous news articles. And now we know the protocol success was only short-lived, as these ponies have lost the battle and either died or were euthanized.
