Brazil death unlikely to be linked to SA [South Africa] outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------
South African health experts said Thursday [4 Dec 2008] that a
mystery illness that killed a local man in Brazil this week was
unlikely to be linked to a recent outbreak of deadly haemorrhagic
[fever] virus in Johannesburg. The 53-year-old man, who died Tuesday
[2 Dec 2008] in Rio de Janeiro, had an operation in mid-October
[2008] at a Johannesburg hospital, which treated several cases of a
new arenavirus strain, which killed 4 people.

But South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases,
which is working with their Brazilian counterparts, said it was
unlikely that he had been infected with the same virus. "He did not
have contact with any of the patients who had the arenavirus
infection," said Lucille Blumberg, the institute's deputy director.
"The time from any possible exposure to the virus to the development
of symptoms ... would be less than 21 days, and the time from his
admission there to development of his current illness is in excess of
this period." Tests for the arenavirus conducted at the US Centres
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta would "definitely
exclude the diagnosis," Blumberg said.

Rio de Janeiro's state health ministry said the man, whose name was
not released, died Tuesday [2 Dec 2008] after falling ill on 25 Nov
2008, 2 days after arriving in Brazil to attend conferences. He was
taken to hospital with fever, vomiting, blood in his urine, and
rashes. Doctors suspected he had contracted an arenavirus, a highly
contagious group of viruses that includes Lassa fever, an infection
endemic to West Africa that typically spreads to humans from
proximity to rodents or from infected people's secretions. "While the
cause of his illness is not at this stage known, investigations are
ongoing to define a case," Blumberg said.

The recent arenavirus scare in South Africa was first identified in a
woman airlifted from Zambia, and also killed a member of the medical
staff who accompanied her, a nurse and a hospital cleaner.

[It is becoming increasingly unlikely that the South African patient
who died in hospital in Brazil had contracted a viral haemorrhagic
fever in the Johannesburg hospital where he had been a patient in
mid-October (2008) at a time when there was an outbreak of viral
haemorrhagic fever caused by a novel (previously uncharacterised)
arenavirus. Nosocomial transmission of the novel arenavirus (still to
receive a name) is unlikely in view of the lapse of time between
possible exposure to the virus and the patient's onset of illness.
The nature of the patient's illness when hospitalised in
Johannesburg, however, has not been disclosed and may be relevant.

The outcome of laboratory tests now in progress is awaited.
