Eli Schwarz from the GeoSentinel Tel Hashomer site in Israel has alerted us to a number of cases of dengue fever in Israeli travelers returning from a group tour to the Seychelles islands during the period April 13 to 22 2017. The group included 32 travelers and each day they visited a different island. The islands visited, in consecutive order, were: Mahe, Curieuse, Aride, Praslin, La digue and Moyenne.

Febrile illness started 1-2 days after return to Israel in 9 of the travelers. In 6 of the febrile travelers DF was confirmed, in 4 by PCR and in the other 2 only by positive IgM serology. The other 3 were not tested for dengue. The PCR positive cases were all DENV-2.

Laboratory workup was done by Dr Yaniv Lustig at Central Virology Laboratory, Israel Ministry of Health, Chaim Sheba Medical Center and by Prof Dana Wolf at Hadassah Medical center, Jerusalem Israel.

Apart from the above-mentioned Israeli cases, only one recent case in the GeoSentinel database, from December 2016, was acquired in the Seychelles. This cluster of cases may signal an outbreak or increased dengue fever activity on these islands. Intending travelers should be advised to adhere to effective measures against mosquito bites during the daytime and early evening.

[A large outbreak of dengue was reported in Seychelles in May 2016 as well [http://tinyurl.com/y7v8lnbq] According to the Ministry of Health, from Jan 2016 to 10 Jun 2016, 388 people tested positive for dengue, with 85 per cent of the cases being under 40 years of age. Dengue vector mosquito Aedes Aegypti has been reported from the islands and outbreaks are reported mainly during the rainy season [http://www.health.gov.sc/wp-content/uploads/Dengue-Update_100616.pdf].

In Seychelles there is high incidence of leptospirosis, now with dengue in circulation and the perfect climatic conditions for both diseases, patients presenting with dengue-like illness having high fever, muscular pain, headache or rash can be a challenging clinical diagnosis for treating physicians. Due to the strong similarity in clinical presentation and epidemiology between dengue and leptospirosis and reported occurrence of dual infections, it is advisable in patients presenting with acute febrile illness consistent with dengue-like illness to be evaluated for both dengue and leptospirosis, which could be a differential diagnosis in the negative cases from the above report.

The confirmation of dengue infections in the travelers to Seychelles emphasizes the need for travel advice to ensure public education and timely protective measures. - Mod.UBA
