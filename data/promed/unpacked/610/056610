Scientists who tested 8 dead swans found in a river in Caernarfon
[north west Wales] have ruled out bird flu as a cause.

The bodies of the birds were found in a stretch of water along the
Afon Seiont, last week [11 Jun 2008] within a few hundred yards of
the town's historic castle.

Locals alerted Caernarfon harbourmaster Richard Jones who, with
members of his team, went out in a boat to collect and bag the carcasses.

They were then taken to a Defra (UK Department for Environment, Food,
and Rural Affairs) lab in Shrewsbury where they were taken to be
tested for bird flu.

Last night [17 Jun 2008] a National Assembly spokeswoman said that
tests were continuing to find out exactly why the birds had died.

It is not thought pollution was to blame, as no fish were found to be affected.

She said: "Tests carried out on the swans from the river Seiont in
Caernarfon have ruled out bird flu.

"Wild birds die for a variety of reasons and further examination is
continuing to seek to determine the cause of death."

Harbourmaster Mr Jones said: "I haven't yet been notified but a
doctor told me that it wasn't likely to be bird flu. Obviously we're
very pleased to hear the news. I am very glad for the area and the
people here that it isn't bird flu but we are still waiting to hear
what was the cause of the swans' deaths."
