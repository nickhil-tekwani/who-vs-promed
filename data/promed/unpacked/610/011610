Northwest Province hit by cholera
------------------------------------------
3 people have been admitted to Northwest hospitals with cholera, provincial
health authorities said on Wed 31 Mar 2004.
The 3, a man and 2 women, are from the Kanana township in Klerksdorp and
were admitted at the Tshepong and Klerksdorp hospitals for treatment, said
Barba Gaoganediwe. "Their condition is presently satisfactory," he said.
Gaoganediwe said the cause of the cholera outbreak was not yet known, but
as none of the 3 had visited any other area or had received visitors, the
source must be local. "All other recent cases reported in the province were
'imported'," Gaoganediwe said.
12 cases reported in 2000 were probably caused by a leaking sewer at the
Taulekoa Mine in Orkney.

locally acquired cholera in recent years. - Mod.LL]
