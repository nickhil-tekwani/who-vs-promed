A preventable infection that turns sufferers yellow is making an "unusual" resurgence in Victoria, Australia, with health authorities reporting the state's worst outbreak of hepatitis A since the introduction of modern sewerage. Local cases of the highly contagious liver infection have typically been rare. Most of the 30 to 80 infections reported across the state each year are related to travelers returning from endemic countries where people are forced to live in less hygienic conditions. But the health department is warning that hepatitis A cases are now spreading between Victorians, with 263 cases so far in 2018 -- the highest number since records began in 1991. In addition, 2 people have died in the outbreak, including a man in his late 60s who had pre-existing conditions.

"This is the biggest outbreak we would have had since hepatitis A was endemic in Australia, which is really before reticulated sewerage came into being," said Victoria's acting chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton. The event is linked to an outbreak in Europe that in recent years has affected hundreds of people, mostly men who have sex with men.

Although authorities are confident local infections are now slowing, they have extended a free vaccination program to June 2019 and have expanded it to homeless people and adult prisoners after a spate of cases affecting those groups. Those most at risk from contracting the infection in Victoria are gay or bisexual men, or injecting drug users. Hepatitis A usually spreads through infected objects, food or water, but transmission can also occur through sharing injecting equipment and sexual activity.

The Alfred Hospital's director of HIV medicine, Professor Jenny Hoy, said clinicians had been offering vaccinations to many gay male patients since February 2018, and she welcomed the extension of the state-funded program. The inoculation is not routinely offered in Australia through standard childhood vaccinations, but Professor Hoy said it had been discovered that some people were already immune, having received injections ahead of travelling to Asia, South America and Africa. "If you've had the 2 doses 6 months apart that gives you life-long immunity," she said.

The infectious diseases specialist said hepatitis A symptoms could vary dramatically, and some people may not even realize they have it. The Alfred has also seen a number of people hospitalized with the infection in 2018, and in extreme cases sufferers can experience liver failure, she said.
