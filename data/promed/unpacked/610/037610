Suspected Anthrax epidemic hits Bawku West District
---------------------------------------------------
A suspected anthrax epidemic has hit livestock in the Bawku West District of the Upper East Region. Joy News sources revealed that more than 20 cattle died in one farm alone under strange circumstances.

Some herdsmen and livestock farmers have seen their cattle die strangely. Some of the affected herdsmen told Joy News they woke up Friday [5 Apr 2013] only to see their cattle lying dead on their farms.

One of the worried livestock farmers told Joy News they had lost 27 cattle as of Friday. He said the cattle showed no signs of sickness on Thursday and expressed worry over the situation. The farmer said officers from the veterinary services had visited their farm and injected the animals but the situation is the same.

District Chief Executive for the area, Anaba Adam Moro however said no reports of an anthrax outbreak have been made to his office. Mr. Moro urged the farmers to remain calm as officers begin thorough assessment of the situation for prompt action to be taken.

[Anthrax in cattle and small ruminants is common in the Upper East Province on an almost annual basis [see ProMED refs. below], with parallel human cases and fatalities. The Upper East veterinarians struggle to be able to travel from farm to farm to vaccinate their cattle. The FAO data on Ghana shows that Ghanaian cattle are concentrated in the upper half of the country and most densely in the small Upper East Region. Hence the concentration of cases in this area.
