Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Sweden
-----------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 20 Mar 2015 from Dr Ingrid Eilertz, Chief Veterinary Officer Director and Head, Swedish Board of Agriculture Department for Animal Welfare and Health, Ministry for Rural Affairs, Jonkoping, Sweden

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (Final report)
Date of start of the event: 18 Feb 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 19 Mar 2015
Report date: 20 Mar 2015
Date submitted to OIE: 20 Mar 2015
Date event resolved: 5 Mar 2015
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 26 Apr 2006
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1: S. Blasieholmshamnen, Stockholm, Stockholm, Stockholms Lan
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Feb 2015
Outbreak status: Resolved (5 Mar 2015)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mute swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Outbreak 2: Djurgarden, Stockholm, Stockholm, Stockholms Lan
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Feb 2015
Outbreak status: Resolved (5 Mar 2015)
Epidemiological unit: Not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mute swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mute swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, in percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Mute swan: _Cygnus olor_ (Anatidae) / ** / ** / 100.00 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: 10 mute swans found dead in central Stockholm (2 batches of 5 swans each) were post-mortem examined and tested for avian influenza virus as part of routine surveillance. The 1st 5 examined were all negative for avian influenza virus and post-mortem exam followed by chemical analysis confirmed lead poisoning. The last 5 were all positive for influenza A virus (matrix-gene positive). None had macroscopic lesions suggesting highly pathogenic avian influenza infection, whereas macroscopic lesions suggesting possible lead poisoning were found in 4, and lesions suggesting traumatic injury found in the 5th. Two of the birds were positive for H5 and were subsequently typed as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8. There are no commercial poultry holdings in the near vicinity. In accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, Article 10.4.1, point 8, this outbreak does not change the disease free status of Sweden as the birds involved in this outbreak are wild mute swans and do not fall within the OIE definition of poultry.

Control measures
Measures applied: Vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Institute (national laboratory) / Mute swan / real-time PCR / 19 Mar 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Outbreaks of HPAIV A(H5N8) viruses have been reported in aquatic migratory birds, chickens, geese and ducks in China, Japan, and Republic of Korea (South Korea) since January 2014, reaching Siberia (Russia's Sakha Republic, widgeons) in September 2014. Since early November 2014, the virus penetrated Europe, so far reported from wildlife and poultry in Germany and the Netherlands, and in poultry only (solitary foci) in the UK, Italy and Hungary. Sweden has become the 1st European country in which this strain has been detected in wild birds only.

According to the analysis presented in Eurosurveillance 19(50) of 18 Dec 2014 (see archive no. 20141227.3056665), the influenza A(H5N8) virus is a complex reassortant virus carrying genes from A(H5N1) as one of its parental viruses. An ancestral strain was 1st reported in China in 2010. In 2014, following further virus evolution via reassortment, the virus started its spread in eastern Asia, Siberia and Europe. A map showing the outbreaks as of the end December 2014 is available at http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V19N50/Adlhoch_fig.png.

The current report from Sweden underlines the perception that this HPAI strain spreads mainly by migratory birds. The routes (flyways) and species involved, as well as the distances the respective bird species are able to fly while infected, are yet to be clarified.

So far, no human infections are known. The potential of novel avian influenza viruses to become zoonotic is discussed in ProMED-mail post 20150317.3237174. - Mod.AS]
