Scrapie prion pathogens in the farm environment could be a long-term
source of infection to sheep and cattle [see comment], according to
ADAS scientists.

Tests carried out at a sheep farm with a detailed history of endemic
scrapie revealed the presence of scrapie-causing proteins on metal
gates, water troughs, feed troughs, penning structures and plastic and
wooden fence posts at least 3 weeks after their last contact with
infected animals.

By contrast, similar structures from a different farm, housing sheep
known to be scrapie-free, had no detectable contamination.

If these findings are correct, it may have implications for healthy
flocks moving onto farms thought to have been thoroughly
decontaminated following previous cases of the disease.

Thanks to rigorous health controls, robust biosecurity procedures and
the implementation of a selective breeding programme in sheep, the
prevalence of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), such
as scrapie, in the UK has fallen to very low levels, with these
diseases no longer imposing a serious economic or epidemiological
burden on British farmers.

However, the key implication from these investigations is that
previous understanding of the risks of TSE infectivity may be
incomplete [but see commentary]. It is not known whether the levels of
environmental contamination that ADAS were able to detect are
sufficient to cause disease in exposed animals, but further and more
detailed research may yield the answer.

[The above report is apparently based upon the paper "Environmental
Sources of Scrapie Prions" by Ben C. Maddison, Claire A. Baker, Linda
A. Terry et al, published in Journal of Virology of Nov. 2010, p. 11
560-11 562 Vol. 84, No. 21. The abstract is the following:

"Ovine scrapie and cervine chronic wasting disease show considerable
horizontal transmission. Here we report that a scrapie-affected sheep
farm has a widespread environmental contamination with prions. Prions
were amplified by protein-misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA) from
7 of 9 environmental swab samples taken, including those from metal,
plastic, and wooden surfaces. Sheep had been removed from the areas
from which the swabs were taken up to 20 days prior to sampling,
indicating that prions persist for at least that long. These data
implicate inanimate objects as environmental reservoirs for prion
infectivity that are likely to contribute to facile disease
transmission." (Contrary to the above FWI information, the paper does
not say that the scrapie prion pathogens would infect cattle).

These findings are not surprising; they confirm previous knowledge
about the striking survivability of the "classical" scrapie agent,
which led some countries to apply very severe measures to prevent
reintroduction of susceptible animals into contaminated premises.

For example, in Norway, where the 1st scrapie case was recorded in
1981, in addition to culling of the affected flocks, the official
policy prescribes extensive sanitary measures. These included the
removal of manure, removal of material unsuited for disinfection,
cleaning and disinfection of buildings, changing of upper layer on
surrounding roads, ploughing and/or burning of grazing areas, and
fitting of new fences where in contact with sheep and, in addition, an
empty period of 2 (3 since 2005) years of the affected farm, the new
flock being subject to restrictions for 5 years after restocking.
These control measures may also be implemented in flocks that have had
contact with scrapie-positive flocks by movement of animals. Similar
measures were applied during the 90's in Israel.

In recent years, an "atypical" form of scrapie has been identified in
several countries: initially in Norway (2002) and subsequently in
other countries, such as Australia, Denmark, Ireland, UK, USA and
others. Atypical scrapie is considered to be non-infectious, or at
least less infectious, than classical scrapie for sheep and is
believed to be a spontaneous, age-related disease. In such cases, the
sanitary measures required are significantly less severe.
