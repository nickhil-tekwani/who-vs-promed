An owner of a cattle pen in the Cattle Colony died of Congo Crimean haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) on Saturday [16 May 2015], the 1st death in Sindh due to the deadly tickborne virus so far in 2015, officials said.

The man, aged 37, was admitted to a private hospital with a severe fever, shortness of breath and haemorrhage 2 days before he was pronounced dead by doctors on Saturday. "It was the 1st case of CCHF in Sindh in 2015," said an official in the provincial health department. He said the victim caught the viral disease through a tick found on animals. "Butchers or those who deal in livestock are likely to catch the deadly virus," said the official, adding that there was no vaccine available to prevent people from falling victim.

Experts said in some rare cases across the world the disease was reported to be spread from human to human.

During 2014, 16 people were afflicted with CCHF in what was described as a 15-year high. Of the 16 people, 6 lost their lives.

The city [Karachi] reported a single case in 2013 and 5 cases of CCHF, including 4 shepherds who [traveled] to Karachi from Balochistan in 2012.

[The circumstances under which the patient was described to acquire his CCHF virus infection imply transmission of CCHF virus via tick bite. It is also possible that he acquired the infection via exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who were in contact with the above patient.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
