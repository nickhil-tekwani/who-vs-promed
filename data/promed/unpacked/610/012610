New South Wales (NSW) residents have been advised to vaccinate themselves against measles after 2 returning travellers were diagnosed with the disease. Both people diagnosed with the infection are aged in their 40s. They bring the total number of measles notifications for NSW to 37 this year (2019), compared with 13 notifications for the same period last year (2018), data from NSW Health show.

Both NSW residents, returning from South America and New Zealand, respectively, remain isolated in hospital for management of complications from their infections. Dr Vicky Sheppeard, director of communicable diseases NSW Health, said that after their return to Australia both cases visited locations in Sydney while infectious on [15 and 16 Aug 2019] [see source URL for locations]. "Anyone who was in the same locations as the cases [on these dates] should be alert for signs and symptoms of measles until [8 Sep 2019]," Dr Sheppeard said. "None of the locations visited by these 2 people pose an ongoing risk."

About 350 children in the Tosh Hasidic community north of Montreal have been vaccinated against measles, after 5 cases of the disease were confirmed there this summer (2019).

The 2nd of 2 temporary clinics set up by the public health authority within the community closed on [16 Aug 2019] after vaccinating at least 150 youngsters over 4 days, said Isaac Weiss, who is one of the people responsible for security and public safety in the community, which is located in the town of Boisbriand, Quebec. He said the 1st clinic took place about a month earlier, after "one suspected case" was discovered. About 200 children were vaccinated at that time. The immunization was offered to those whose medical records showed they were unvaccinated or not up to date, but was voluntary.

Community leaders are co-operating fully with the CISSS des Laurentides, which ran the clinics, said Weiss. The public health director, Dr Eric Goyer, said these were the 1st cases of measles in the region since 2011. There are about 500 Tosh families in Boisbriand, or 3000 people.

No one knows for sure how the infection spread. Weiss said it is thought that a young man from the community who went to New York to take part in a recreational after-school program may have contracted the virus and brought it back to Boisbriand. It appears that he had been vaccinated, but his shots were not up to date.

The community's leaders are informing members about the necessity of vaccinations and trying to dispel any fear about the risk of negative side effects. Unvaccinated children will not be permitted to attend the community's schools until the outbreak is deemed contained, Weiss said, but parents can only be persuaded, not forced, to vaccinate their children.

A father of 5 who asked that his name not be published, said, "We are outraged that there are parents -- a few -- who are so irresponsible as to refuse (vaccination). The rabbis are talking about it, everyone is talking about it, but some are difficult to convince."

Last spring (2019), when there was a serious measles outbreak in New York, Montreal public health authorities stepped up an educational campaign targeting ultra-Orthodox communities. While the rate of vaccination among those communities is believed to be similar to that of the general population, there is frequent contact between the Montreal and New York communities.

At the time, Rabbi Yonasan Binyomin Weiss, who serves as the chief rabbi of Montreal and heads the medical ethics committee of the Jewish Community Council, stated, "From a religious perspective, and also from an ethical and moral perspective, our message is very clear: families are required to follow the directions of the health authorities."

In April (2019), many Montreal doctors were among over 500 medical professionals serving Orthodox Jewish communities throughout North America who signed a public letter confirming the need for everyone to be vaccinated according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. The doctors rejected "the dangerous misinformation campaign being spread and reject any unproven unscientific statements that contradict all available current science-based studies on vaccinations" against measles and other illnesses.

The director-general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu said, "DSNOs (disease surveillance notification officers) and health facilities in high-risk areas and the technical working group (TWG) members, with a team from John[s] Hopkins University, visited 4 states to conduct training on use of measles RDTs (rapid diagnostic test kits). "They planned to follow up with states to ensure continued vigilance and early reporting" and "to also conduct state-level training on sample management and RDT testing for other high-priority states and to conduct community sensitisation across all LGAs (local government areas) of Adamawa State," he said.

Speaking on measles, he disclosed that there were 470 suspected cases reported from 136 LGAs in 28 converted states and the FCT. He added that none were laboratory confirmed, and no deaths were recorded.

Ihekweazu said that the multi-agency National Measles TWG was monitoring and coordinating response activities across the states. "TWG is working closely with [the] National Measles Technical Coordination Committee (NPHCD) towards the upcoming measles supplementary immunisation activity (SIA), and introduction of [the] 2nd dose of measles vaccination.

"They conducted a planning meeting for AAR [after action report? - Mod.SH] and [a] measles guideline review meeting, also [devised] a travel advisory [notice] on [the] measles outbreak, shared across different media platforms," he said. The NCDC boss said that the centre would continue the review of measles surveillance data, across the nation, and also [would] continue planning for [the] AAR and measles guideline review meeting.
