DPI vaccinates cattle stocks after anthrax deaths
-------------------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries is vaccinating cattle on an
Upper Hunter property after the death of 5 head of stock from
anthrax. It is not known how the outbreak on the Rouchel property,
near Scone began. The department says it is not unusual to get a few
outbreaks of the disease each year.

New anthrax outbreak hits Upper Hunter
------------------------------------------
The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries says while
anthrax has now spread to 3 properties near Scone in the Upper
Hunter, the situation is under control.
A total of 5 head of cattle have died on one property at Rouchel.
Cattle on 4 other properties have been vaccinated. DPI spokesman
Brett Fifield says they have been working closely with the property
owners and the disease is being contained. "We've been monitoring the
situation and vaccination is underway on 4 neighbouring properties,"
he said. "Following that we have detected anthrax on 2 neighbouring
properties to the original site, but we believe we have the disease
contained using vaccine. Cooperation has been flowing with the owners
of the properties. At this stage it is a routine response and we are
watching the situation very closely."
He says the outbreak in Scone is a surprise."We do have an anthrax
belt in New South Wales and this incident in Scone is nowhere near
that belt, so we are looking at how this came to be," he said. "The
DPI is confident we have the situation under control."

[A quick check on the temperatures in NSW show that it is in fact not
stressful, around 20 degrees C (68 degrees F), with the dew point in
the same range. See:
<http://www.wunderground.com/global/Region/AU/Temperature.html>
Brett Fifield is correct in saying that these outbreaks are in a
"new" area for NSW. We look forward to hearing the results of their
investigations.
"New" outbreaks can be from various causes ... in winter it is
usually due to imported contaminated feed or hay. But it is now
mid-summer in NSW and thus in the middle of the usual 'Anthrax
Season' so that hypothesis is out of line. Memories being what they
are and the turnover of farm ownership, remembrance of old outbreaks
is soon lost and at the best of times it is not very reliable.
However the infecting spores had to come from somewhere and they
don't have legs. Scone is in a valley system and therefore one can
suspect a washout of an old cattle grave upstream on another farm. On
the other hand when this disease is truly sporadic and without
consistency the causes are then from soil movements in relation to
old graves, e.g., bulldozing when road making, clearly ditches and
springs, cutting trenches for new water troughs in pastures, brush
clearing and discing overgrown pastures.
If the noted 'spread' is real, and I have no reason to doubt their
observations, it could be explained by tabanid ('horseflies') and it
is notable that 5 head have died of anthrax on the index property. In
our experience this is an adequate loading number to initiate
effective fly spread to neighbouring herds. If interested, look up
what happened in Saskatchewan in 2006, and in North and South Dakota
in 2005. Same situation. The NSW authorities would be wise to have
all herds with a 5-10 kms (3.1-6.2 mile) radius of the index herd on
the alert for new cases. Female tabanids can fly 8 kms (5 miles)
without trying as they potter about looking for the next animal to
snack on. - Mod.MHJ]
