From: Arthur King <Kinga@EM.AGR.CA>

There was an article in the Nov 23/99 issue of the Buffalo News reporting a
total of 5 of 46 horses at a stable on Grand Island, NY had tested positive
for EIA. An additional 16 horses were removed from the property between the
test on one horse which was positive and the test on the remaining 45
horses (4 of which were positive). I am not sure why NY State has not
reported this to ProMED-mail. Are you in a position to solicit the facts
and publish them?
