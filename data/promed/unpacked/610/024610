Foot-and-mouth disease vaccination certificates to become compulsory
from July [2011]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Livestock farmers who do not have a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)
vaccination certificate for their livestock will be unable to do
business at a livestock market and will be denied permission to ship
livestock products to slaughterhouses.

According to a report by Jeju Special Self-Governing Province on 28
Jun 2011, the new order requiring the certificate was implemented on
24 Jun 2011. It affects not only cattle and pigs but also goats.

Farmers without the certificate may be fined up to 5 million won
[about USD 4700], according to Article 60 of the Domestic Animal
Infectious Disease Control Law.

On a related note, the province will conduct booster injections on
cattle and pigs from 20 to 28 Aug 2011.

[Jeju-do (transliterated Korean for Jeju Province, short form of Jeju
Special Autonomous Province or Cheju Island) is the only special
autonomous province of South Korea, situated on and coterminous with
the country's largest island. Jeju-do lies in the Korea Strait,
southwest of Jeollanam-do (South Jeolla) Province. Its capital is the
city of Jeju; see maps at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jeju_SK.png and
http://healthmap.org/r/0*Ic.

During the major FMD epizootic which swept throughout mainland South
Korea between November 2010 and April 2011 (155 outbreaks, indicated
in the interactive map at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993)
the Cheju island remained clean. Korea changed, during the course of
the epizootic, its traditional FMD policy from "stamping out,
vaccination forbidden" to "modified stamping out, vaccination in
response to the outbreak(s)". The last 2 outbreaks started,
reportedly, on 19 and 21 Apr 2011 in the North Gyeongsang province
(south east Korea).

The last follow-up report was submitted to the OIE on 29 Apr 2011
(see ProMED-mail 20110504.1376); the disease is, reportedly,
"continuing".

The compulsory vaccination measure, undertaken in Jeju-do, may
probably be explained by the wish to prevent potential exposure of
susceptible animals to circulating FMD virus infection when introduced
from the island ashore. - Mod.AS]
