Three Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed in Louisiana
---------------------------------------------------------------------
BATON ROUGE: Three men have been hospitalized with West Nile virus
infection, the first human cases of the potentially deadly infection
reported in the nation this year, officials said. A 78-year-old man was
diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus on Mon 8 Jul 2002, and 2 more men,
ages 62 and 53, were diagnosed on Thu 11 Jul 2002. All live in towns east
of Baton Rouge. Gary Belfamo, a public health veterinarian and assistant state
epidemiologist, said officials suspect the men were exposed to the virus at
least 2 weeks ago. Dr. Anthony Marfin with the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said on Friday that the Louisiana cases are the first
[human cases] reported to the CDC in 2002.

West Nile virus has killed 18 people along the East Coast since it was
first detected in this country in New York in 1999. Last summer was the
most severe so far, with 66 human infections and 9 deaths reported.

Mosquitoes spread West Nile from infected birds to humans, who can then
develop deadly encephalitis, or swelling of the brain. Humans cannot pass
the virus to each other. Symptoms are similar to the flu, including fatigue
and fever. There is no cure for the virus. "The likelihood is that this
virus will cross the entire country," Balfamo said. State officials said
they planned to begin an awareness campaign to thwart an outbreak.

The CDC in Atlanta urges people to report dead birds to local health
authorities and to protect themselves against mosquito bites by getting rid
of standing water, where mosquitoes breed, and to wear insect repellent or
long sleeves outdoors. On the Net: Centers for Disease Control and

[The 78-year-old man, who was diagnosed as a confirmed case of West Nile
virus infection on Mon 8 Jul 2002, was reported first as a suspected case
of West Nile virus infection in a press report dated 2 Jul 2002, which
formed part [11] of the ProMED-mail post "West Nile virus update 2002 - USA
(10) 20020707.4685". The appearance of these three human cases of West Nile
virus infection so early in the course of the 2002 outbreak is a matter for
concern. - Mod.CP]
