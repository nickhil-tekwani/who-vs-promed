1st report of Pierce's disease of grapevine (_Xylella fastidiosa_) in Taiwan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2002, characteristic symptoms of Pierce's disease (caused by _Xylella fastidiosa_ - EPPO A1 List) were observed in commercial vineyards in central Taiwan. Leaf scorch symptoms appeared at the onset of berry ripening in late May to early June. Necrotic tissue with yellow or burgundy red margins developed at the edge of the leaves and then coalesced. Severely affected leaves became fully necrotic and fell prematurely, leaving matchstick-like petioles attached to the cane. Affected twigs and branches declined and plant dieback was observed within 1 to 5 years.

Samples (petioles) were collected from diseased plants and tested (ELISA, PCR) for the presence _X. fastidiosa_. Koch's postulates [scientific method for verifying the causal agent of a plant disease] were fulfilled by artificially inoculating the isolated bacterium to _V. vinifera_ cultivars. The inoculated plants developed typical leaf scorch symptoms and the bacterium could be reisolated from them, thus confirming that the grapevine leaf scorch disease in Taiwan is caused by _X. fastidiosa_. This is the 1st time that Pierce's disease is reported from Taiwan and from Asia.

In Taiwan, _X. fastidiosa_ was first reported in 1993 causing a leaf scorch disease in Asian pear (_Pyrus pyrifolia_). Phylogenetic analyses were performed by comparing 12 Pierce's disease strains from Taiwan with the sequences of 13 _X. fastidiosa_ strains from different hosts and different geographical areas. Results showed that the Pierce's disease strains of Taiwan were closely related to the American _X. fastidiosa_ grape strains but not to the pear strains of Taiwan, suggesting that the _X. fastidiosa_ grape and pear strains of Taiwan may have evolved independently from each other.

Concerning insect vectors, extensive field surveys conducted in Taiwan showed that in affected commercial vineyards, one xylem-feeding leafhopper _Kolla paulula_ might be a potential vector (the most efficient vector in America, _Homalodisca coagulata_, does not occur in Taiwan). The bacterium was detected in _K. paulula_ but further studies are needed to verify that it can transmit the disease.

Since the 1st observation of Pierce's disease symptoms in 2002, a total of 12 023 affected grapevines have been destroyed in commercial vineyards. However, the disease has not been successfully controlled 10 years after its initial discovery, possibly due to the inefficient suppression of the bacterium in other host plants acting as reservoirs in the vicinity of vineyards. Further studies are needed to identify these potential host plants and develop management strategies to control the disease.

[_Xylella fastidiosa_ clogs the xylem in infected plants causing wilting, necrosis, and often death of the host. It has been reported from a number of crop hosts causing very serious diseases such as Pierce's disease of grapevine, leaf scorch of almond, phony disease of peach, leaf scald of plum, variegated chlorosis of citrus, lucerne dwarf, as well as leaf scorch of coffee, elm, oak, plane, mulberry, maple, oleander, and other woody ornamentals. Latent infections of a number of wild species have also been reported, and these can serve as pathogen reservoirs. While all strains of _Xylella_ have been classified into a single species, there are different pathotypes, most of which have not been characterised and compared with each other yet. Several subspecies have been proposed.

_X. fastidiosa_ is spread by xylem-feeding insect vectors including several species of sharpshooters (including _Carneocephala_, _Draeculacephala_, _Graphocephala_, and _Homalodisca_ species). It can also be spread by grafting and with infected plant material, but is not seedborne. Moist conditions favour the vectors and therefore _X. f._ associated diseases. The pathogen has been reported mainly from the Americas, but, until now, has only been suspected in a few locations in Asia. Its occurrence in Oceania is currently unknown. Both the bacterium and its main vectors are of serious quarantine concern in Europe, Africa, and Australasia. Disease management is difficult due to the large numbers of potential reservoir hosts and vector insects and may include use of clean planting and grafting material, as well as vector control.

Since the pear and grape strains in Taiwan are reported not to be closely related, they may have originated from different sources or be due to separate quarantine incursions.
