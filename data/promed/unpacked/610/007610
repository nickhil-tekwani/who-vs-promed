BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY IN AUSTRIA
(Disease never previously reported).
Emergency report
Information received on 14 Dec 2001 from Dr Peter Weber, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Social Security and Generations,
Vienna:
Report date: 14 Dec 2001.
Diagnosis: On 6 Dec 2001, the preliminary rapid test for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) showed a positive result for a cow
from the federal province of Lower Austria (Niederosterreich). On the
same day that the BSE contingency plan came into effect, the
provincial authorities were informed and movement restrictions were
placed on all the animal carcasses at the slaughterhouse.
The test was repeated on 7 Dec 2001 and followed by the
immunohistochemical test as an additional method. Both the rapid test
and the immunohistochemical test showed positive results.
The sample in question was sent to the OIE Reference Laboratories for
BSE in Weybridge (United Kingdom) and Bern (Switzerland) for
confirmation of diagnosis (confirmation at the Central Veterinary
Laboratory in Weybridge on 13 Dec 2001).
Affected animal and structure of the farm of origin:
- A flecked cow, born on 8 Feb 1996 (i.e., 70 months old), which did
not present clinical signs;
- The establishment keeps 60 cattle and is situated in northern Lower
Austria (district of Gmund). It is a medium-scale establishment
dealing in milk and meat production;
- After complete culling of all cattle in the farm, all brains of
bovines aged more than 24 months will be examined for changes
indicating BSE.
Measures taken:
- immediate ban placed on the herd of origin; and epidemiological
investigations instigated;
- immediate ban on the slaughterhouse;
- notification of the suspected case to the European Commission,
European Union Member States and neighbouring countries of Austria;
- sampling under surveillance of the official authorities in the
affected establishment (feed, milk substitute) and slaughterhouse (to
guarantee the correct identification of the positive sample).
Since 1 Jan 2001, all slaughtered bovines aged more than 30 months are
subject to examination in the course of the all-Austrian surveillance
programme. Furthermore, all suspect animals are also examined for BSE.
The total number of examinations carried out up to 9 Dec 2001 was 217
970.
