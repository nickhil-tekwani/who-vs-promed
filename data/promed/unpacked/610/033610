Anthrax, bovine - Argentina (Loberia, Prov. de Buenos Aires)
-----------------------------------------------------------
On 17 Feb 2012 a veterinarian suspected anthrax and submitted 2 metacarpal bones from the affected carcasses for culture and identification of Bacillus anthracis. The 2 cows were pregnant Aberdeen Angus animals that had died suddenly with extravasation of blood from their natural apertures. The herd consisted of 320 similar animals and none had been vaccinated against anthrax. The estancia is in the Partido of Loberia, Paraje El Moro de la Province of Buenos Aires.

In 1995 this estancia suffered a similar outbreak of anthrax in which 3 animals died and one of the cows had aborted a 5 month old foetus. The region has been in a drought for 3 months, but there was rain in the past 20 days.

The carcasses were treated in the normal manner -- thickly covered in lime and overall a thick plastic tarpaulin, weighted around its edges.

[Though this is a region of high risk and the estancieros are strongly and routinely advised to vaccinate their stock, the continuing risk is ably demonstrated by, yet again, the deaths of unvaccinated animals.

Ramon has recently published an article on the environmental aspects of livestock anthrax in the province. MC Rojas et al, 2011. Componentes de paisaje que favorecen la aparicion de carbunco en la Pampa Deprimida (provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina). Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz. 30(30): 897-909 which is well worth reading.
