Imported _P. falciparum_ malaria in Paraguay
----------------------------------
A case of falciparum malaria has been detected in Asuncion. The
patient is a 33-year-old male who contracted the parasite in Africa
[Democratic Republic of Congo], where he was a construction worker.
The Ministry of Public Health announced that there is no risk of
transmission of the disease, because the patient is being treated and
he does not live in an endemic area. Dr. Carlos Maria Romero, of
Senepa [National Service for the Eradication of Malaria in Paraguay],
commented that the situation would be different had the case not been
detected on time and the patient travelled to Caaguazu or Canindeyu,
where the vector is found.
Malaria is a tropical disease transmitted exclusively by the
_Anopheles_ mosquito. In Paraguay in 2002 there were 2600 registered
cases of vivax malaria, the most benign type of the disease, in the
areas of Canindeyu, Caaguazu, Alto Parana, Guaira, and Caazapa.
Between January and February of 2003, 50 cases have been registered.
_P. falciparum_ malaria is also present in Mato Grosso, where the
mortality rate is high. The falciparum parasite does not exist in
Paraguay, and the health authorities are concerned that it could be
introduced and propagated if not detected in a timely fashion. The
characteristic symptom of the disease is high fever, the same as with
dengue fever, with which this case was initially confused. If
untreated, it produces serious hepatic alterations and anemia.

[_P. vivax_ is endemic in the northern provinces of Paraguay, where
the climatic conditions are compatible with _P. falciparum_
transmission. According to Gideon, malaria is primarily encountered
during October through May, with all reported cases in the
departments of Alto Parana, Amambay, Caaguazu, Canendiyu, and San
Pedro. In recent years, the risk area is defined as Alto Parana,
Caaguazu, and Canendiyu only. 66 cases were reported in 1982; 49 in
1983; 554 in 1984; 4568 in 1985; 4329 in 1986; 3741 in 1987; 2884 in
1988; 5247 in 1989; 2912 in 1990. 2983 cases were reported in 1991;
1289 in 1992; 436 (10/100 000) in 1993 -- with only one case due to
_Plasmodium falciparum_); 583 in 1994 (including 12 _P. falciparum_);
898 in 1995; 637 in 1996; 567 in 1997. The fluctuation in cases over
the past 2 decades demonstrates that the vector is present. It is
doubtful that only 12 cases could be due to autochthonous
transmission; there simply cannot be a reservoir for so few cases;
they are probably imported. Knowing the number of workers from
Paraguay working in Africa and returning to Paraguay would be
interesting. - Mod.EP]
