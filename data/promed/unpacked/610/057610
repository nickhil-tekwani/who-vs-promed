Following a brief illness, a 14-year-old Highland's County male died of
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) on October 12. The child had extensive
exposure to mosquitoes in the weeks prior to illness while working after
school in a local grove and playing in woods close to home in the Lake
Placid [Florida] area. There was no travel history outside of the county
in the three weeks prior to illness. Onset of symptoms on October 7
consisted of headache and fever. Laboratory testing at the State
Laboratory on serum collected on October 10 was HAI and IgM positive for
EEE virus and negative for [antibody to] SLE virus. This is the first
reported death due to EEE (in Florida) for the year. In 1996 there was a
confirmed case of EEE in a
7-year-old male from Taylor County.
