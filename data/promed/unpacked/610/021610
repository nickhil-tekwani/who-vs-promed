Abstract
--------
The nematode _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is a zoonotic pathogen and the etiological agent of human angiostrongyliasis or rat lungworm disease.

Hawai'i, particularly east Hawai'i Island, is the epicenter for angiostrongyliasis in the USA.

Rats (_Rattus_ spp) are the definitive hosts while gastropods are intermediate hosts. The main objective of this study was to collect adult _A. cantonensis_ from wild rats to isolate protein for the development of a blood-based diagnostic, in the process we evaluated the prevalence of infection in wild rats.

A total of 545 wild rats were sampled from multiple sites in the South Hilo district [Hawaii county] of east Hawai'i Island. Adult male and female _A. cantonensis_ (3148) were collected from the hearts and lungs of humanely euthanized _Rattus rattus_, and _R. exulans_.

Photomicrography and documentation of multiple stages of this parasitic nematode in situ were recorded. A total of 45.5 percent (197/433) of rats inspected had lung lobe(s) (mostly upper right) which appeared granular indicating this lobe may serve as a filter for worm passage to the rest of the lung. Across _Rattus_ spp, 72.7 percent (396/545) were infected with adult worms, but 93.9 percent (512/545) of the rats were positive for _A. cantonensis_ infection based on presence of live adult worms, encysted adult worms, L3 larvae, and/or by PCR analysis of brain tissue.

In _R. rattus_ we observed an inverse correlation with increased body mass and infection level of adult worms, and a direct correlation between body mass and encysted adult worms in the lung tissue, indicating that larger (older) rats may have developed a means of clearing infections or regulating the worm burden upon reinfection.

The exceptionally high prevalence of _A. cantonensis_ infection in _Rattus_ spp in east Hawai'i Island is cause for concern and indicates the potential for human infection with this emerging zoonosis is greater than previously thought.

[Hawaii has reported a high number of indigenous cases not related to the consumption of imported, raw snails. See previous ProMED postings below. The study by Jarvi et al shows a high rate of infection in rats demonstrating that there is an animal reservoir with a high burden of _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_. - Mod.EP
