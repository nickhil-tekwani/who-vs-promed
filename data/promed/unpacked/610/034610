More Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and deaths have been reported in 2 countries affected by the ongoing outbreak in West Africa, including a newly affected district in Guinea, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on 10 Jun 2014. The expansion in numbers and areas affected is worrisome, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said today [10 Jun 2014] in a new risk assessment.

ECDC said in its risk assessment that the resurgence of cases and expanded areas affected in the outbreak that seemed to be winding down a few weeks ago are concerning. It said media and anecdotal reports suggest that public health response operations haven't brokered the trust and community support needed to identify contacts, monitor them, and isolate sick patients. "A new wave of transmission is currently unfolding, and it is, therefore, likely that additional cases will be identified in the coming weeks," the agency wrote.

Transmission chains in Sierra Leone are related to ongoing EVD transmission in Gueckedou, which is in the forested area of Guinea and has been one of the outbreak's hot spots. ECDC added that community and nosocomial infections are still occurring in Gueckedou, Mancenta, and [the capital] Conakry, as well as new areas in Boffa and Telimele.

Outbreaks in other areas, however, including Kissidougou, Dabola, and Dinguiraye, appear to be over, the agency said, because 2 incubation periods [42 days] have passed [without another case].

In Liberia, the new case that was recently reported involves a patient who was discharged against medical advice and died on 25 May 2014. The body was returned to Sierra Leone, and the contacts that are being followed include health workers and family members.

Though rising numbers of cases and affected areas increase the risk for Europeans working and living in affected areas -- especially humanitarian and health workers -- the overall risk of EVD is still low for visitors to the affected West African countries if basic precautions are followed, ECDC advised. Precautions [advised] include avoiding contact with live or dead animals, avoiding consuming bushmeat, washing and peeling vegetables before eating, practicing safe sex, and taking proper hand hygiene steps.

ECDC urged health workers in the area to strictly adhere to infection prevention measures, especially those related to personal protective equipment use. It added that the risk of seeking medical care in the area will depend on how well facilities are implementing precautions.

Ebola update 12: [10 Jun 2014] (evening)
----------------------------------------
A total of 114 cases have been tested with 43 confirmed cases of Ebola and 16 deaths. All deaths are confirmed cases from Kailahun District; 2 of them travelled from Kailahun to Kambia district. There is also a positive case from Port Loco -- linked to one of the positive cases from Kambia. These patients have been isolated and contacts are being traced.

Interventions
-------------
- The outreach medical team is still in the field searching for more cases.
- Sensitization of the communities including the traditional healers is ] ongoing.
- Ebola physician specialist from WHO headquarters is now in Kenema to support case management at the treatment Centre.
- A meeting with SLANGO (Sierra Leone Association of Non-governmental Organizations) which includes faith based organizations and non-health international NGO members was concluded today [10 Jun 2014]. The Minister was able to get commitments from these organizations to support the fight against the spread of the disease.

As government and its health development partners continue to fight the outbreak of Ebola virus disease that has so far claimed the lives of 16 people:
The government through the Ministry of Health and Sanitation and other participating ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) is therefore putting the following measures in place with immediate effect as part of an overall national strategy in addressing the outbreak of Ebola virus disease:
1. All vehicles and their passengers entering and leaving Kailahun district must subject themselves to screening by authorities at various checkpoints.
2. All schools in Kailahun district are closed with immediate effect, and that the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology is making arrangements with the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) for those students slated to sit to the National Basic Education Examinations (BECE) to take the exams at a later date.
3. To minimise the risk of transmission from person to person, government hereby orders the prohibition of all public gatherings, including but not limited to, cinemas, cultural activities, and night clubs in Kailahun district.
4. That local and cross-border trade fairs (locally known as the "Lumors") are temporarily closed until such a time when the Ebola virus would have been contained.
5. That the general public is mandated to report to health authorities any person (s) or stranger (s) with symptoms of the Ebola disease in their respective communities for appropriate professional health interventions.
6. All deaths across the country must be reported and certified by an authorised health professional before burial.
7. All Ebola or related deaths must be buried at place of occurrence under the supervision of health personnel.

We wish the public to know that government and particularly all participating MDAs are on top of the situation, and therefore call on the general public to cooperate with the above measures as part of the national collective drive to further raise awareness to stop further spread of the disease.

[3] Sierra Leone: borders closed

Sierra Leone shut its borders to trade with Guinea and Liberia on Wednesday [11 Jun 2014] and closed schools, cinemas, and nightclubs in a frontier region in a bid to halt the spread of the ebolavirus; 16 people have died of Ebola in Sierra Leone, a figure that has doubled in the last week, Ministry of Health figures showed.

Authorities will also mount health checkpoints in the eastern Kailahun district and mandated that all deaths there be reported before burial. Anyone who dies of the virus must be buried under the supervision of health personnel, the Information Ministry said.

The decision to close district schools came after a 9 year old whose parents died of Ebola tested positive for the virus, deputy minister of information Theo Nicol told Reuters. "There is more contact between school-going kids than adults, hence the closure of schools in the most affected district," he said. The ban exempted churches and mosques, but religious leaders should urge anyone with a fever to go to a clinic, he said. Local groups welcomed the measures, given public concern over the virus, which can be transmitted by touching victims or their bodily fluids.

[4] Sierra Leone: VHF Program at KGH
Date: Wed 11 Jun 2014
From: Robert Garry <rfgarry@tulane.edu> [edited]


Here, we provide an update on confirmed, probable, and suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in Sierra Leone.

As of 10 Jun 2014, 120 suspected cases have been evaluated at the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH) Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF) Laboratory operated under the direction of the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS). 74 of the suspected cases were negative by laboratory tests and have been reclassified as non EVD cases. Among 46 laboratory confirmed positive cases that have been recorded in Sierra Leone, outcome data is available on 26 of them. There have been 17 deaths among these 26 confirmed cases, for a case fatality rate [CFR] of 65 per cent. Efforts continue to track 20 confirmed cases, some of whom refused to be admitted to the VHF management unit at KGH. Among 4 probable cases, there have been 3 deaths. The status of the 4th probable case is pending further investigation.

22 of the confirmed EVD cases have been admitted to the KGH VHF management unit; 14 of these patients have died, for a CFR of 64 per cent; 7 cases are currently admitted, and one case was discharged [9 Jun 2014]. 3 additional cases now meet discharge criteria and are being discharged from the KGH VHF management unit today [10 Jun 2014]. It is encouraging that despite late presentations of these cases to the KGH VHF management unit that there are survivors.

All confirmed EVD cases in Sierra Leone are epidemiologically linked to Kailahun district. The index case of the outbreak in Sierra Leone was a traditional medicine practitioner (herbalist) living in Koindu, in Kailahun District bordering the EVD epicenter of Gueckedou, Guinea. She treated individuals with EVD who came from neighboring Guinea and died of probable EVD. The 1st confirmed EVD case in Sierra Leone was a woman identified on the KGH maternity ward who had a late term spontaneous abortion on [25 May 2014]. She had attended the traditional funeral of the index case and was also the 1st case to be discharged from the VHF ward. 6 of the confirmed cases, including the 1st confirmed case, were identified on the general wards of KGH. These individuals were all from Kailahun district and came to KGH seeking medical treatment.

43 confirmed cases are residents of Kailahun district. The 3 confirmed cases that are not Kailahun residents include 2 residents of Kambia district and one resident of Port Loko district. One of these individuals was the driver of a vehicle that included a probable case as a passenger. This passenger was a health care worker (HCW) who attended one or more confirmed cases in Koindu. The entire trip was from Koindu to Daru to Kambia. However, the HCW became too ill to continue and made her way to a health post in Daru before her death from probable EVD. The other case from Kambia and the case from Port Loko are epidemiologically linked to the driver from Kambia. The 3 confirmed cases from Kambia and Port Loko were identified via the MoHS District Health Surveillance system and were subsequently transported to KGH.

Case investigations continue centering principally in and around Daru town. In addition, the MOHS KGH VHF team is transporting confirmed EVD cases to KGH and assisting communities and families in safe burials of probable and confirmed EVD cases. There is active monitoring of case contacts, including KGH staff.

Please note that numbers are subject to change.

[5] GAC donation to Guinea

Guinea Alumina Corporation SA (GAC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA), has re-affirmed its commitment to investing in the social development of Guinea and the wellbeing of the country's residents by donating a lump sum of USD 250 000 to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for use in the latter's efforts (in collaboration with the Guinean Ministry of Health) against the current outbreak of the deadly Ebola fever.

With no effective treatment and no human vaccine against Ebola virus disease (EVD), the World Health Organization has advised that education and hygiene are critical for containing and eliminating EVD. Accordingly, the UNICEF project aims to help limit the spread of the disease through public awareness of the risk factors for infection. "This is an excellent initiative to manage the EVD epidemic, and GAC is pleased to be in a position to make this contribution," said Mamady Youla.

The donation from GAC is in keeping with the company's track record of investing in community-based education and healthcare projects. To date, GAC has built 6 schools, 4 health posts, 3 community centres, and drilled 23 community wells in Guinea. A further 3 schools and 2 health posts are under construction. The company has also engaged in vital community engagement activities such as adult literacy courses, road safety, education programs on HIV and AIDS, and malaria management programmes.

[6] Numbers problem

[On 8 Jun 2014], I posted a report from Guinea in which WHO's tally of Ebola cases came in for criticism. Now Dr Jody Lanard offers an explanation:

"I'm sure you already noticed that the Guinea officials are citing confirmed cases only, whereas WHO is citing the total of the probable, suspected, and confirmed cases, which is the normative way of citing Ebola numbers during an Ebola outbreak. The Guinea officials seem to be glossing over this distinction to justify calling the WHO numbers a mistake.

"From WHO's Ebola case definitions during an outbreak, it looks as though suspected and probable cases are thought to have a high likelihood of being true Ebola cases. The definitions can be seen at http://bit.ly/1xEcaiK.

"In the past, WHO and others have routinely and explicitly included "presumptive cases" (suspected plus confirmed) in their totals for Ebola outbreaks, along with the break-outs of suspected vs. confirmed. (Example: Figure 2, graphing the largest Ebola outbreak to date, Uganda 2000, at http://1.usa.gov/SKNtRn).

"The current West Africa outbreak/epidemic now has the 2nd highest number of cases on record (see WHO's "Chronology of previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks" table at http://bit.ly/1ivlbD0)."

I think the Guinea Ministry is ... citing apples to WHO's oranges. ... In any case, their protest makes them look less credible. What a ghastly situation, from so many perspectives.

[7] Guinea: revised numbers
Date: Wed 11 Jun 2014
From: DB, MD [a reputable source known to ProMED-mail, edited]


If you look at the revised numbers in Guinea, the country has returned to its original approach of only reporting confirmed cases, rather than confirmed, plus probable, plus suspected (which has been the standard for ebolavirus outbreaks). The purpose of this is likely to give a false impression that the outbreak is not as severe as it actually is.

Guinea took this approach initially, and at the strong encouragement of international partners, reluctantly changed their reporting to the standard of confirmed plus probable plus suspected, but it appears that they have reverted back to their original approach. The major consequence of this approach when taken earlier in the outbreak was that contacts of probable and suspect cases were not traced and followed, because they were not officially cases in the eyes of the ministry.

Hopefully, this approach will not be repeated; if it does occur, the situation will continue to deteriorate.

[I have to wonder how effective border closure can be in the present circumstances. But the end of cross-border trade will have an economic impact.

The VHF Program at KGH previously reported the number of Lassa fever cases coincidentally diagnosed during the EVD investigations. It would be interesting to know whether there is a concurrent Lassa fever epidemic complicating the picture.

The 1st case of EVD in a child is reported in [3] above. Although children are not involved in the care of sick people, nor in burial rites, they have close contact with their mothers even when their mothers are ill. There is also close contact between children in schools, especially during playground contact.

The problem of the data is complicated further because ProMED-mail has been reliably informed that the experimental Harvard antigen for ebolavirus used in Sierra Leone gives a large number of false negatives. If true, the real case numbers could be much higher, and there may be many unrecognized contacts out there.

Apparently, Dr Nadia Wauquier has been named by MOHS Sierra Leone as responsible for the lab diagnosis; all the samples are tested by her in the MOHS/Metabiota Lab by rtRT-PCR (real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction validated by the US Department of Defense), and they are the only confirmatory results taken into account by the MOHS. - Mod.JW]
