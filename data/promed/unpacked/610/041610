The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [29 Jul 2014] investigating an imported case of Japanese encephalitis (JE) affecting a man aged 54 and urged the public to take precautions against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

The patient, who has an underlying illness, lives in Pu'er, Yunnan. He developed fever, headache, and confusion since [23 Jul 2014] and was admitted to a local hospital on [24 Jul 2014]. He was transferred to a private hospital upon arrival in Hong Kong on [27 Jul 2014] for further management. He is currently in stable condition. Investigation is ongoing.

His blood and cerebrospinal fluid sample tested positive for antibodies against JE [virus], a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. The test was done by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.

To date, 3 JE cases (2 local and one imported) have been reported to the CHP this year [2014].

In 2013, 6 cases (2 local, 3 imported, and one unclassified) were reported while 3 (one local and 2 imported) were filed in 2012.

"JE is a viral disease transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ (Culicine mosquito) is the principal vector of JE and is nocturnal. It mainly breeds in waterlogged fields, marshes, ditches, and small stagnant collections of water around cultivated fields.

The mosquitoes become infected by feeding on pigs and wild birds infected with the JE virus, and then transmit the virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. JE is endemic on the Mainland and in Southeast Asia," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Most JE virus infections are mild without apparent symptoms other than fever with headache. More severe infections are clinically characterised by quick onset of headache, high fever, neck stiffness, impaired mental state, coma, tremors, occasional convulsions (especially in infants), and paralysis.

To avoid contracting JE, members of the public, particularly those living in rural areas, are reminded to take heed of the following preventive measures, especially after dark:
- Wear loose, light-coloured, long-sleeved clothes, and trousers;
- Use effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothing when outdoors; and
- Use mosquito screens or nets in rooms which are not air-conditioned.

Travellers to endemic areas of JE should take the following precautions:
- Avoid outdoor exposure to mosquito bites at dusk and dawn, especially in rural areas, when mosquitoes spreading this virus are most active;
- Apply effective insect repellents containing DEET over exposed parts of the body and clothes; and
- Consider vaccination and arrange a travel health consultation with a doctor to determine the need for vaccination and vector preventive measures at least 6 weeks before departure to endemic areas in Asia or the Western Pacific for stays over one month, particularly in high-risk rural areas.

[As the report above indicates, there have been sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection in Hong Kong (see ProMED-mail archives listed below). There have been 3 cases previously reported this year (2013) in Hong Kong. The virus is endemic in large areas of Asia, including Japan and China. Because Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JEV, it would not be surprising to see additional cases occur occasionally. Individuals living in, or traveling to, JEV endemic areas are well advised to follow precautions to avoid mosquito bites. JEV vaccine is available in China, but there is no mention about the immunization status of the above 2014 cases.
