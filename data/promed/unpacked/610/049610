Minnesota health officials announced that a new strain of norovirus has resulted in the state's 1st outbreak, which could mean more infections this winter.

The New Year could usher in a bout of vomiting, watery diarrhea, and stomach cramps for many people in the U.S., Minnesota state officials warned. A new strain of the highly contagious norovirus has emerged in the state, which could mean more infections elsewhere this winter.

The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) reported on Tues [22 Dec 2015] that the new strain of the what some have nicknamed the "winter vomiting disease" has resulted in the state's 1st outbreak; sporadic cases of the virus 1st appeared earlier in 2015. Officials added reports of norovirus-like illnesses in the community have also increased in the past week. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the new strain of the gastrointestinal illness can increase infections by more than 50 percent.

"Every few years, a new strain of norovirus emerges and causes many illnesses. We don't know yet if this new strain will lead to an increase in the number of outbreaks reported, but it could," Amy Saupe, a foodborne disease epidemiologist at MDH, said in a statement. "If we're meticulous about washing our hands and handling food properly, we may be able to limit the impact."

According to state officials, the strain, called GII.17 Kawasaki, caused many outbreaks in Asia during the winter of 2014 before making its way to the U.S. Since the beginning of September [2015], the Minnesota health department has investigated more than 20 outbreaks caused by the norovirus, while outside of Minnesota, outbreaks have been confirmed in Boston, Seattle, and California. However, CBS News reported the latter outbreaks have not been linked to the new strain of the illness.

The gastrointestinal illness can strike any time throughout the year, but it is most common during the winter; the norovirus season peaks in January.

"No one likes to get vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach aches, especially during the holidays," Saupe said. "Norovirus tends to hit especially hard during the winter season, so now is a good time to get in the handwashing and norovirus prevention habit."

Each year, the norovirus causes 19 to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and contributes to an estimated 800 deaths, mostly among young children and older adults in the United States, the CDC reported. The virus is passed through close person-to-person contact, contaminated food or water, and contaminated surfaces, objects, or substances.

Norovirus symptoms, which typically begin 1 or 2 days after infection and can last up to 48 hours, include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, body aches, a general run-down feeling, and a mild fever. Health officials say the majority of norovirus illnesses and outbreaks often comes from eating contaminated food and can be prevented through vigilant hand washing and appropriate food handling.

Minnesota
-----
A new strain of norovirus, the most common cause of sudden intestinal illness, has shown up in Minnesota, and that could mean more norovirus illnesses this winter, state health officials warned in a statement.

The new strain, called GII.17 Kawasaki, caused many outbreaks in Asia last winter before arriving in the U.S. Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) has investigated more than 20 outbreaks caused by norovirus since the beginning of September 2015. The new strain 1st showed up in sporadic cases in the state earlier in 2015, and the 1st outbreak caused by the new strain was reported last week. Reports of norovirus-like illnesses in the community have also increased in the past week.

"Every few years, a new strain of norovirus emerges and causes many illnesses. We don't know yet if this new strain will lead to an increase in the number of outbreaks reported, but it could," said Amy Saupe, a foodborne disease epidemiologist at the MDH. "If we're meticulous about washing our hands and handling food properly, we may be able to limit the impact."

Norovirus is the most common cause of food-related illness in Minnesota. In a recent outbreak example, employees who had been sick with diarrhea prepared food items that were eaten by restaurant patrons and at least 25 patrons became ill from norovirus. The majority of norovirus illnesses and outbreaks can be prevented through good handwashing and appropriate food handling.

California
-----
California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Director and State Public Health Officer Dr. Karen Smith announced on 23 Dec [2015] that California is experiencing an increase in norovirus cases, commonly referred to as stomach flu or winter vomiting disease. CDPH has confirmed 32 outbreaks of norovirus in California since 1 Oct 2015 -- likely resulting in hundreds of reported sicknesses in the state. These outbreaks far exceed the number reported at this time in 2014.

"Among the most important things you can do to avoid norovirus and other illnesses this holiday season is to wash your hands frequently with soap and running water for at least 20 seconds," Dr. Smith said. "This is especially important after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food. Hand sanitizers are not effective against norovirus."

Norovirus is a highly contagious virus that causes gastroenteritis, an illness that usually involves vomiting and diarrhea. It is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in the United States, and is responsible for approximately 20 million illnesses each year, with 570-800 deaths reported annually. The virus can spread quickly in closed and crowded environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, daycare centers, schools, cruise ships and food service settings like restaurants.

People with norovirus are very contagious and can easily spread the illness from person to person. The virus may be found in both stool and vomit and ill persons can still be contagious up to 2 weeks or more after recovery. People can become infected in several ways, including: having direct contact with another person who is infected, eating food or drinking liquids contaminated with norovirus, or touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching your mouth.

Safe food handling practices can prevent the spread of norovirus and other infectious diseases. In addition to washing your hands after every bathroom visit, this includes washing fruits and vegetables before eating, cleaning and disinfecting food preparation equipment and surfaces, and thoroughly cooking all meats, fish and poultry.

[It appears from the 1st report, according to CBS News, that the increase in cases in California is not due to the new strain, GII.17 Kawasaki.

Norovirus is transmitted by fecally contaminated food or water, by person-to-person contact, and via aerosolization of the virus and subsequent contamination of surfaces. Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, projectile vomiting, malodorous watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever may occur.

The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract it make a full recovery within a couple of days. After infection, immunity to norovirus is usually incomplete and temporary. Outbreaks of norovirus infection often occur in closed or semiclosed communities, such as long-term care facilities, overnight camps, hospitals, schools, prisons, dormitories, and cruise ships, where the infection spreads very rapidly either by person-to-person transmission or through contaminated food. Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by a single infected person.

The virus causes approximately 90 percent of epidemic nonbacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world, and may be responsible for 50 percent of all food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis in the United States.
