3 cases of scrapie were detected this week [January 2000 in a flock of
sheep in the township of Candoi, in the south of Parana state, Brazil. The
Ministry of Agriculture discounts the possibility that this could spread to
cattle, and gives assurances that scrapie is not transmissible to humans.
To avoid spread, 305 sheep in the flock were slaughtered, sheep breeding was
temporarily suspended in Candoi, and the outbreak was immediately reported
to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) & the governments of
Mercosul (Argentina, Paraguay & Uruguay).
The sheep had been imported from the USA, where scrapie is known to occur
[was there a failure in export screening?.
According to Luiz Alberto Oliveira Ribeiro, of the Veterinary Faculty of the
Federal University Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), the first case of scrapie
detected in Brazil was in Rio Grande do Sul in 1977. A new focus appeared
in Parana in 1985, as a result of which 143 sheep were slaughtered. The
sheep had been imported from the UK [the country where scrapie was first
found. Since that time, Brazil has stopped buying sheep from the UK and
imports them from Canada & the USA. Nevertheless, another case was
identified in Rio Grande do Sul in 1994.

[Transmission of scrapie is complex, as there are breeds/strains of sheep in
which there is a genetic predisposition to come down with it (probably a
shorter incubation period so that the disease appears early before normal
culling of ewes), and horizontal transmission via amniotic fluids (to the
unborn lamb) and foetal tissues (ewes nibbling on another eweÂ´s placenta
after birth, etc.) Sperm has no part in it or any other TSE. - MHJ
