University warns of disease problems if California rice seed imported
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A shortage of medium grain rice seed in Arkansas has prompted some
desperate dealers and growers to search for other seed sources out of
state, including California. The problem is that there is a
quarantine on seed imports from California because of bakanae
disease, according to Dr Rick Cartwright, University of Arkansas.
"This is a seed-borne disease of rice common in Asia, and first noted
in California in 1999. It is not known to be present in Arkansas or
other southern rice states," Cartwright said.

The disease is caused by a fungus that, once it becomes established,
can't be eliminated, Cartwright said. The seed can't be effectively
cleaned of infection, he said. The disease builds up in seed and
mainly causes problems for seed producers. He said, importing and
planting California grains will represent high risk to the Arkansas's
rice industry. "We're not sure if other states are preventing this
risky seed movement at this time, although our State Plant Board is
advising them to be aware of the situation."

The California varieties aren't adapted to Arkansas growing
conditions. "They will get killed by rice blast, a major Arkansas
rice disease," he said. California varieties are extremely
susceptible to the races of the blast fungus present in Arkansas,
Cartwright noted, and in the 1990's were heavily damaged by it. He
said the leaves were dead within 7 days and fungicide applications
were ineffective. "California rice breeders have been working on
blast resistance, but it's only to the race they have."

[Bakanae disease of rice (also called foot rot in some Asian
countries) is caused by the fungus _Gibberella fujikuroi_ and can
cause significant crop losses of up to 20 percent. The fungus also
affects other crops, including barley, maize, sorghum, sugarcane,
tomato, banana, and cowpea. Symptoms on rice include abnormal growth
patterns, death of seedlings, reduced tillering, and partially filled
or empty seed heads. The fungus infects plants through roots or
crowns and later becomes systemic. Seeds are usually infected during
the flowering stage and the disease is primarily seed-borne. The
fungus survives under adverse conditions in infected seeds and
diseased plant parts. Disease management is difficult and includes
use of certified clean seeds and fungicides, however rapid
development of pathogen resistance has been observed.

Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe grisea_ (synonyms
_Pyricularia grisea_, _P. oryzae_) with potential yield losses of
more than 50 percent. The fungus can affect leaves, neck, collar, and
nodes. Spread occurs with infected plant material, by mechanical
means, water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and
cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence. For more information on rice
blast see links and previous posts below.
