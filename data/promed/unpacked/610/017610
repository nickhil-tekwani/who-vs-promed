The state Secretariat of Health confirmed this Tuesday (14 [Jul 2015]) the 1st case of Zika virus [infection] in Parana. The individual is a 48-year-old woman, resident of Sao Miguel do Iguacu, in the eastern area of the state, who presented with symptoms in May [2015] and is now well.

"Initially, the case was diagnosed as dengue, but laboratory tests rule out that disease, which motivated a continuation of the investigation with samples sent to the Fiocruz [reference] laboratory, which confirmed that it was Zika virus," explained the Chief of the Environmental Surveillance Center of the state Secretariat of Health, Ivana Belmonte.

In this case identified in Sao Miguel do Iguacu, before the diagnosis was established, teams investigated the possibility of infection by dengue and parvovirus [infections], which were ruled out.

[2] Bahia state and Guillain-Barre syndrome

Bahia is facing what the State Secretariat of Health is calling a triple epidemic: dengue, chikungunya and Zika. The Zika epidemic could be related to an increase in cases of a rare syndrome.

A 6-year-old girl is hospitalized in Feira de Santana [where a chikungunya outbreak was or is occurring. - Mod.RNA] in the interior of Bahia [state] with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome [GBS]. In Salvador, a 26-year-old woman with the same diagnosis died after a month in the hospital. [No evidence is presented that either had a Zika virus infection. - Mod.TY]

This [GBS] is a rare syndrome with a mean of one case per 100 000 population. But in the last 2 months, 55 cases were reported in Bahia, 29 of which were confirmed by the Ministry as GBS cases." "[The population of Bahia is 15 million, so 29 confirmed cases of GBS is 0.2 cases per 100 000, and even 55 cases is well below 1 per 100 000. - Mod.JW]

Specialists suspect that these [GBS] cases are related to the epidemic of Zika virus, a virus transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, the same one that transmits dengue and chikungunya [CHIK] [viruses]. The state has reported more than 32 000 cases of Zika [virus infection] this year [2015]; Although possible, they are not confirmed cases. They are, in the great majority, suspected cases that are at most [clinically] compatible or probable cases. It is difficult to say so categorically that all this volume of cases results from the Zika [virus] infection, especially in an epidemiological scenario of co-circulation of dengue and chikungunya viruses. Were there at least laboratory tests done for dengue and CHIK viruses? - Mod.RNA]. "It's a strong indication, because [of] the data on epidemics of Zika virus in other countries and the association that we are having today with this large increase [of GBS cases], higher than expected, [that occurred] directly after Zika virus introduction," said infectious disease specialist Antonio Bandeira.

The Secretariat of Health reserves beds in 16 hospitals in the entire state to receive GBS patients. In Salvador, 1 of these [hospitals with reserved beds] is the Hospital and Clinics of the Bahia Federal University. In the [state] capital, there are 18 beds available for these patients. For the Secretariat, this is a sufficient number for now. The state Secretariat of Health stated that they have the drugs in stock needed to treat the syndrome, but they have asked for help from the federal government.

[The number of GBS cases potentially related to Zika virus infections increased significantly since our last report (PORT archive no. 20150623.3458263). While many doubts, gaps and questions persist, this situation is quite complex and a cause for concern.

Confirmation of GBS is a less complicated task: there are clinical criteria, progression of symptoms, CSF [examination] and electromyography that define and confirm the syndrome. The big question is: in a situation with co-circulation of dengue, CHIK and Zika [viruses], as well as the herpesviruses and enteroviruses, and seasonally influenza and post influenza vaccination campaigns, [how] to investigate, discard and, ideally, identify the etiology in order to understand, confirm and quantify in the most objective and realistic way possible for now, and still, hypothesize an association of Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barre syndrome?

From what has been reported, there was an increase in the number of cases of GBS diagnosed from the time of the occurrence of the 1st human cases of Zika [virus infections] in Bahia. One cannot rule out, however, that greater attention and sensitivity of health and surveillance system professionals explain, to some degree, the detection of some cases that occur anyway, with or without Zika [virus infections]. Another issue that should be considered is that, most likely, most if not all of the cases had no laboratory confirmation of Zika [virus] infection. Were they properly investigated (and discarded) for other agents, notably dengue and chikungunya?

Although the literature, based on observational data from previous epidemics in small countries (in fact, islands), shows the association between Guillain-Barre syndrome and Zika, the actual or expected frequency of this manifestation of clinical complication is not known. Would it be a really common complication, putting Zika in the list with other flaviviruses that are associated with encephalitis and other neurological syndromes? Or would it [GBS cases] be a relatively rare event for Zika [virus] infections but with the absolute number of GBS cases considered high, that in reality would be a result of a large number of Zika fever cases, with a [Zika virus infection] incidence (in addition to possible asymptomatic infections) much higher: an epidemic of large proportions?

The relationship between dengue virus [infection] and GBS is well established:

Some reports in the literature pointing to a possible causal relationship between a significant increase in GBS incidence and a Zika virus epidemic in French Polynesia include:
- Oehler E et al. Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barre syndrome--case report, French Polynesia, December 2013. Euro Surveill. 2014 Mar 6;19(9).
- Musso D et al. Rapid spread of emerging Zika virus in the Pacific area. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2014 Oct;20(10):O595-6: [The incidence rate of GBS cases during the ZIKV outbreak was approximately 20-fold higher than expected given the size of the FP population and the established incidence rates of GBS [Guillain-Barre Syndrome] (1-2/ 100 000 population per year) [6]. No severe disease resulting from ZIKV infection had been reported prior to the FP [French Polynesia] outbreak, but previous clinical characterization was based on a limited number of confirmed cases. The recent temporal and spatial association between the FP ZIKV outbreak and the highly unusual GBS cluster is very suspicious but does not confirm ZIKV as the antigenic stimulus predisposing to this autoimmune disease].

One cannot neglect to mention an association reported between chikungunya virus infection and the occurrence of neurological syndromes, including GBS. Some references follow:
- Lebrun G et al. Guillain-Barre syndrome after chikungunya infection. Emerg Infect Dis. 2009 Mar;15(3):495-6.
- Tournebize P et al. Neurological manifestations in Chikungunya: about 23 cases collected in Reunion Island]. Rev Neurol (Paris). 2009 Jan;165(1):48-51.
- Lemant J et al. Serious acute chikungunya virus infection requiring intensive care during the Reunion Island outbreak in 2005-2006. Crit Care Med. 2008 Sep;36(9):2536-41.
- Wielanek AC et al. Guillain-Barre syndrome complicating a Chikungunya virus infection. Neurology. 2007 Nov 27;69(22):2105-7.
- Mod.RNA]

Mod.RNA has clearly identified the problems and challenges that the appearance of Zika virus in Brazil presents for health providers and officials in that country. The questions he raises about the need for confirmation of the Bahia cases are serious, as are the relationship (or not) of Zika virus infection and GBS. Association does not prove causality but certainly suggests that more investigation is needed.

It is very likely that the virus will spread across Brazil and throughout the Americas, where vector mosquitoes are abundant and dengue viruses are transmitted. Inexpensive, reliable tests are needed to support rapid accurate differential diagnoses of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya virus infections.
