OIE expert's mission to assess the avian influenza situation of wildlife in
Russia
------
At the request of the OIE delegate of Russia, the World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE) has started yesterday [3 Oct 2005] its
expert's mission to assess the avian influenza situation of wildlife
in Russia and the national measures to be taken to minimize the risk
of international spread of the disease. The mission will last one
week.
The reference laboratory of the country (located in Vladimir) and, if
possible, other laboratories will be visited to assess the conditions
for the laboratory in Vladimir to be part of the world wide network
of OIE reference laboratories. Samples from wild birds will be
collected to try to verify whether they carry H5N1. The relevant
species of wild birds will also be listed in order to identify their
migration routes and thus to allow the countries receiving these
birds to be prepared to develop surveillance activities when relevant.
This mission will be the 1st of a series of missions in which the OIE
will offer the necessary technical and scientific collaboration to
Russia needed in combating and/or preventing the disease.
The OIE/FAO world wide laboratory network on avian influenza (OFFLU)
will be in the forefront of these missions.
Below are published the Terms of reference of the mission of OIE
experts to Russia:
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Mission to Russia to assess the avian influenza situation in wildlife
and the national measures being taken to minimize the risk of
international spread.
Requested by: Dr. Evgueny A. Nepoklonov, Chief Veterinary Officer of Russia
Proposed dates of visit: 28 Sep - 7 Oct 2005
Team Composition under the framework of the OIE/FAO Avian Influenza
Laboratory Network (OFFLU):
Dr. Stefano Marangon, OIE Reference Laboratory at the IZS Venezia, Italy
Dr. Ian Brown, OIE Reference Laboratory Weybridge, UK
Dr. Nicolas Gaidet, CIRAD-EMVT, France
Prof. Bjorn Olsen, Infektionskliniken Kalmar, Sweden
Dr. Vittorio Guberti, IZS Venezia, Italy
Duration: 8 working days in Russia
Mission Program
1. To asses the situation with regard to the possible relation
between infection of wildlife with avian influenza and the avian
influenza outbreaks in commercial poultry
- To assess whether there are healthy carriers of the H5N1 strain
- If yes, to assess the role of healthy carriers in the spread of the disease
- To assess which main wildlife bird species could get clinically or
sub-clinically infected and might be involved in the spread of the
disease
- To gather information on the routes and periods of migration of the
relevant (infected) wild birds and to provide advice on a system of
surveillance of wild birds in Russia
- To give advice on a warning system for risk countries receiving the
relevant (infected) wild birds.
2. To assess the current capabilities of the Russian reference
laboratory and, if possible, that of other diagnostic laboratories in
the diagnosis of avian influenza.
3. To submit an independent Mission Report to the OIE on completion
of the mission.
4. Other OIE missions to Russia will be organized just after this 1st
mission with the following purposes:
- Technical and economic evaluation of the reinforcement of the
Vladimir laboratory in order to strengthen capacity and international
recognition in the field of avian influenza diagnostics
- Updating of the legislation and policies on avian influenza
national control in Russia
- Designing by the Russian veterinary authorities of a national
system of surveillance of influenza in wild birds in Russia.
The results of the mission will be published on the OIE web site.

[This exemplary initiative, reflecting the attained interdisciplinary
cooperation of experts from the host-country and the international
community and the need to tackle the avian influenza problem at its
source, is to be praised; hopefully, similar cooperative efforts will
follow in other parts of the world, particularly in eastern Asia. -

[Russia's last follow-up report to the OIE on the avian influenza situation,
including a map of the affected regions, was received on 20 Aug 2005; see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_56.HTM#Sec2>.
Have new outbreaks been suspected/confirmed? If affirmative, where? In which
species? How many avians have been affected, and what control measures have
been applied? A fresh follow-up report would help. - Mod.AS]
