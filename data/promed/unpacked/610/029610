5 People Test Positive for H5N1 in Ankara and Van
-----------------------------------------------
3 patients in the Turkish capital Ankara and 2 in the eastern town of
Van have tested positive for the most pathogenic strain [?] of bird
flu, H5N1, the state Anatolian news agency reported on Sunday [8 Jan
2006]. It quoted senior health ministry official Turan Buzgan as
saying that out of 28 samples diagnosed on Sunday [8 Jan 2006], 5 had
tested positive for H5N1.

3 People Found with [suspected] Avian Influenza in Turkish Capital
-----------------------------------------------
Turkey announced on Sunday [8 Jan 2006] that 3 people had tested
positive for bird flu in the Turkish capital, Ankara, marking a
further westward advance of the infection towards the frontiers of
Europe. Ankara Governor Kemal Onal told the state-run Anatolia news
agency that 2 children and one adult had been diagnosed with the
infection; but it was not clear whether they were suffering from the
H5N1 avian virus that has killed 3 people in the remote east of the country.
The agency said a 5-year old boy had been admitted to the hospital
with suspected avian influenza in Corum in central Turkey. The virus
has been spreading since October 2005 among [poultry] flocks in
Turkey, having advanced from Southeast Asia, but no people in Turkey
had been reported infected until last week [1st week January 2006].
The emergence of human cases of the flu in the Van area, near the
borders with Iran and Armenia, raised fears that the disease might
advance to major Turkish population centers and to Europe.
It seems highly likely that the children who died in the Van region
caught the virus directly from chickens. But world health authorities
are concerned that human exposure to avian influenza could lead to
the emergence of a mutation, allowing easier transmission between
humans and raising the prospect of a pandemic.

Turkey: 30 Suspected Cases, Mostly Children, under Observation
-----------------------------------------------
Teenage siblings who died of avian influenza in Turkey were the 1st
humans outside East Asia to succumb to the deadly H5N1 strain that
has apparently been spread by migratory birds, WHO stated on Saturday
7 Jan 2006. A British laboratory confirmed on Saturday that a
15-year-old girl and her 14-year-old brother were infected with the
virus, said Maria Cheng, spokeswoman for the World Health
Organization. Testing is continuing on an 11-year-old sister who died
Friday [6 Jan 2006]. "She had similar symptoms, and the clinical
course of her illness was the same," Cheng said. "So it would be very
probable that she died of H5N1, but right now, we don't have the
laboratory test to prove that."
5 WHO experts were to travel Sunday [8 Jan 2006] to the city of Van,
near the border with Iran, not far from the village where the 3
children died, to try to determine whether the disease was spread
from animals or other humans. Iran has restricted movement along its
border to prevent the disease from spreading into that country. Cheng
said Turkish laboratories have so far found that 2 other children in
a Turkish hospital are infected with H5N1. The British lab Saturday
[7 Jan 2006] confirmed one of the cases and may be about to confirm
the other, she said.
Altogether, Turkish officials are testing about 30 patients -- most
of them children -- for [suspected] avian influenza, she said. The
spread of the disease from East Asia, where it has killed more than
70 people, was "a concern," but the global risk assessment of a human
pandemic was unchanged, she said. "Right now, these new cases in
Turkey don't elevate the global risk assessment, so we're still in
the same pandemic alert phase that we've been in for the last couple
of years," said Cheng. "But it's something that needs to be monitored
very closely." Turkish Health Minister Recep Akdag said Saturday [7
Jan 2006] there was no reason to suspect human-to-human transmission,
and he urged calm, saying there was no risk of a pandemic. But Dr.
Gencay Gursoy, head of the Istanbul Physicians Association, said the
situation was grave. "Turkey and the world are facing the threat of a
serious infection," he said.
So far, the H5N1 virus has been capable in rare cases of transmitting
from poultry to humans in close contact with them. Experts fear that
if the virus should mutate to a strain that passes easily among
people, it could set off a human flu pandemic. "At the moment, we
don't know enough about the situation to tell whether or not the
virus has changed in some way," said Cheng.
The doctor of the 3 siblings who died said they probably contracted
the illness by playing with dead chickens. Cheng said the area is
rural with a lot of poultry farming and that residents tend to live
in close proximity to their birds. She said the cases were worrying
in part because of the distance from East Asia. "It is a jump," she
said. "And if you look at how H5N1 has spread in animals, it sort of
follows that pattern and implicates the role of migratory birds,
because we started seeing last year [2005] H5N1 being detected in the
Ural mountains, in Siberia, Mongolia, Turkey, Romania."
Authorities have culled thousands of fowl in the affected regions,
but in the village of Dagdelen, on the outskirts of Dogubayazit --
the hometown of the 3 children who died -- villagers gathered outside
an Agriculture Ministry building to complain that no one had come to
cull their fowl. In nearby Bozkurt village, local administrator Ahmet
Koylu said chickens and dogs were dying but that no one had come to
investigate. On Saturday [7 Jan 2006], officials reported a new bird
flu case in poultry in a village near Bursa, in western Turkey, the
Anatolia news agency reported.

Human Avian Influenza Cases Spread West in Turkey
-----------------------------------------------
Turkey reported 3 people infected with a deadly strain of bird flu in
the capital Ankara on Sunday [8 Jan 2006], marking a further westward
advance of human infection towards the fringes of Europe. The 1st
case outside eastern Asia of the virus jumping from birds to humans
emerged in Turkey last Wednesday [4 Jan 2006]. 3 children in the
remote eastern Van region died of the highly potent H5N1 strain that
has killed some 70 people in Asia.
Ankara Governor Kemal Onal told the state-run Anatolia news agency on
Sunday [8 Jan 2006] that 2 children and one adult had been diagnosed
with the infection in the capital, about 400 km (250 miles) from
Turkey's densely populated largest city, Istanbul, Europe and the
Mediterranean area. The agency said a 5-year-old boy had also been
admitted to the hospital with suspected bird flu in Corum in central
Turkey. CNN Turk television said 2 of the 3 infected Ankara children
had been brought to Ankara from nearby Beypazari after contact with
dead wild birds.
It seems highly likely the children who died in the Van region also
caught the virus directly from chickens. But world health authorities
are concerned human exposure to the bird flu could lead to the
emergence of a mutation, allowing easier transmission between humans
and raising the prospect of a global pandemic. A team of World Health
Organization doctors is in Turkey to help investigate the deaths and
look for any signs of transmission between humans. Russia has warned
against travel to Turkey. Moscow raised the early prospect of
economic damage to Turkey's vital tourist industry, warning Russians
against traveling to Turkey after the human infections.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has appealed to Turks to help in a mass
cull aimed at stemming the advance of the virus and promised adequate
compensation to farmers and families who rely on poultry for their
living. But in the Dogubayazit district hit by the virus, local
people have accused the authorities of being slow in acting. A
Reuters reporter saw chickens still walking on the streets and some
escaping as they were about to be carried in large bags to be buried
alive in pits.
Erdogan said the government was taking all necessary measures and
allocating funds to combat the spread of the disease. The virus
spreads quickly among chickens, killing them in a day, and the best
way to control it is to quickly slaughter all poultry in an affected
area. But this can be difficult in countries where, as is common in
eastern Turkey, people keep small backyard flocks.

[The death of dogs in an outbreak area is a novel observation, but
not necessarily related to avian influenza infection. The high
frequency of children among confirmed and suspected human cases of
H5N1 avian influenza is a continuing feature of the disease situation
in Turkey. The number of human cases confirmed by the WHO-reference
laboratory in the UK appears to have risen to 3 (possibly 4), but
this has not yet been publicly acknowledged by WHO. - Mod.CP]
