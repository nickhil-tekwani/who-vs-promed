An outbreak of non-sexually transmitted gonococcal conjunctivitis in
Central Australia and the Kimberley region. Rex Matters, Ignatius Wong,
and Donna Mak, Comm Dis Intell 1998;22:52-58
Abstract: From 13 February to 27 June 1997, 447 cases of gonococcal
conjunctivitis were identified by Communicable Disease and Public Health
Centres and Community Clinics in the Northern Territory, Western
Australia and South Australia. The outbreak involved Aboriginal
communities predominantly in Central Australia and the Kimberley region
in Western Australia. This was the first outbreak recorded in the
Kimberley region. It is not yet known whether the Kimberley cases were
part of the larger Central Australian outbreak or whether they
represented a separate and unrelated outbreak. Environmental factors
associated with this outbreak were similar to those seen in previous
outbreaks. Control measures were based on early recognition and
treatment of index cases and identifying and treating contacts. Until
sexually transmitted _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ is controlled in communities
gonococcal conjunctivitis is likely to appear again. The role of
oropharyngeal carriage of _N. gonorrhoeae_ needs to be evaluated further.
