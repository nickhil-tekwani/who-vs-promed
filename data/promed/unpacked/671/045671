The 5th European monthly measles monitoring (EMMO) surveillance report
has been published by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Prevention (ECDC) [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
(ECDC). European measles monthly monitoring, October 2011. Stockholm:
ECDC; 2011. Available from:
http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Forms/ECDC_DispForm.aspx?ID=778].


Although no new outbreaks were reported in the 29 EU and EEA/EFTA
countries during October 2011, over 1000 new measles cases were
detected through epidemic intelligence, bringing the total number of
cases for 2011 to more than 30 200. Two cases of sub-acute sclerosing
panencephalitis [see moderator's comment at end], one of whom died,
were reported in October 2011. Between January and September 2011, 8
measles-related deaths and 23 cases of acute measles encephalitis were
reported.

The Regional Office for Europe published its Epidemiological Brief in
October 2011 covering the measles outbreaks and preventative measures
taken across 53 member countries [World Health Organisation, Regional
Office for Europe (WHO Europe). WHO Epidemiological Brief: a monthly
publication on vaccine-preventable diseases and immunisation data and
analysis, No. 18 (October 2011). Available from:
http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/153195/Epi_Brief_Issue_18.pdf].
This report highlights the nearly 3-fold increase in cases compared to
the same period in 2007. The wider impact of the outbreaks in Europe
was also examined and, in particular, the link between the resurgence
in measles in South America and its connection with Europe.

956 Confirmed measles cases in England and Wales up to the end of
October 2011
------------
In England and Wales, 956 laboratory confirmed measles cases have been
reported to the end of October 2011. Following the peak in April 2011,
the monthly total of confirmed cases has been falling with between 53
and 68 confirmed cases reported in the last 3 months. The majority of
cases are in unvaccinated individuals (92 percent total).

Outbreaks in schools and small family clusters are continuing to
occur, particularly in London (401 cases) and the South East (255
cases) regions, where most cases have been diagnosed. A history of
travel abroad or contact with someone who had travelled was the source
for infection for 150 confirmed cases this year [2011].

Measles is highly infectious and can cause severe illness and
occasionally death. Following exposure, up to 90 percent of
susceptible people develop measles. The virus can be transmitted from
4 days before the rash becomes visible to 4 days after the rash
appears.

Measles cases in this outbreak were 1st notified in HSE-East [Health
Service Executive-East] in early February 2011. There was a gradual
increase in notifications through the summer months. However, from
early August 2011 (week 31), there was a marked increase in the weekly
notification of cases, to a maximum of 23 cases notified in one week
in late August 2011. By the end of week 42, 265 cases had been
reported nationally; 227 (86 percent) were from HSE-E.

The majority of these cases, 139 (61 percent) were reported during
August and September 2011 (weeks 32-41) from the north city areas of
Community Care Areas 6, 7 and 8 (Dublin northwest, Dublin north
central and Dublin north, respectively). This large increase in cases
was primarily due to a cluster of measles in school age children in a
residential summer camp in north Dublin, which subsequently spread in
the north inner city and Ballymun areas.

During this outbreak period (weeks 32-41), all age groups were
affected. However, the 5-9 year old had the greatest number of cases.
Almost 70 percent of cases were unvaccinated or incompletely
vaccinated. During this time, there were 11 hospitalisations, and the
most frequent reported reason was for the treatment of seizures (3
cases).

Control measures
--------------
An outbreak control team chaired by the Director of Public Health
(HSE-E) with representatives from public health, community medicine,
the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), and the National
Immunisation Office (NIO) was established. Among the outbreak measures
were the following:

- A schools' based "Blitz of MMR" in north inner city Dublin and
Ballymun took place in early September 2011 of all children attending
primary school who had not received the recommended MMR vaccination.
- Prompt follow-up of all reported measles cases by public health
staff including liaising with general practitioners, managing clusters
of measles, arranging swabs for diagnosis, staffing vaccination
clinics and advising cases on appropriate follow-up.
- Informing all Dublin GPs by letter and email of the measles
outbreak and requesting to opportunistically vaccinate all children
with MMR.
- Informing GPs in the outbreak area of additional outbreak measures,
including the vaccination of infants from 6 months and the expediting
of MMR2 in specific circumstances.
- Providing information on the outbreak to acute hospital services,
pharmacists and the Department of Education.
- Releasing multiple media messages to the public through the print
media and local and national radio informing the public of the
outbreak and of the need to have MMR vaccination to protect against
measles.

Since early October [2011], there has been a gradual decline in the
number of measles cases reported weekly in HSE-E to 3 cases reported
in the week ending 2 Oct 2011. A combination of factors is likely to
have facilitated the spread of measles in the affected area including:
suboptimal MMR uptake, social deprivation, high population density,
and the absence of a school based immunisation service.

Vaccination with MMR is the only way to prevent measles infection.
However, nationally and in HSE-E, the MMR vaccination uptake at 24
months is currently 90 percent, which is too low to prevent measles
outbreaks from occurring. MMR vaccine is safe and highly effective in
preventing measles and its complications. Achieving a high
immunisation rate with MMR vaccine is the only way to prevent
measles.

http://www.the-star.co.ke/local/northeastern/50993-14-kavonokya-sect-members-with-measles-hospitalised


Eleven critically ill children and 3 women of the Kavonokya
[religious] sect have been forcefully admitted at Mwingi District
Hospital following a outbreak of measles. The sick were rounded up
during an operation by Mwingi public health personnel led by the
district head David Munyoki. By Wednesday [23 Nov 2011], 501 sect
members' children had been immunised against measles. The
immunisation, backed by armed police officers, was launched after 11
children died from measles in Ngoo sub-location of Mwingi East
district in the past 2 months.

Kavonokya members do not take their children to hospital because they
claim it is against their faith. A Star [journalist] visited the
patients admitted to an isolated ward at the hospital. Munyoki said
the children and their mothers are responding well to treatment. He
said the patients were isolated to avoid cross-infection of other
patients in the hospital. "The rest of the people have received
immunisation, and only members of the Kavonokya sect do not take their
own for immunization. We could not put them together with other
patients," pointed out the public health officer.

Munyoki said 14 villages in Lundi and Ngoo areas of Mwingi East have
been covered in the immunisation programme. He added that the
immunization will be held monthly to ensure all targeted sect members
are inoculated. "We have not faced any serious resistance during our
operation due to the cooperation we are getting from the provincial
administration, who have provided use of police officers to enforce
the programme," said Munyoki.

He added that not only were the Kavonokya children being forcefully
immunized, but plans were underway to arrest and charge them in court
for violating children rights to access health care. The immunization
and the forceful treatment for members of the Kavonokya sect came days
after the Health authorities in Eastern Province proposed the
proscribing of the sect for putting the health of their adherents at
risk.

The provincial public health officer Carol Ndegwa made the demand in
Mwingi when she was the chief guest during the world toilets day
celebrations at Yongooni village in Nuu division of Mwingi East on
Saturday [26 Nov 2011]. She said 11 children died of measles after
their Kavonokya sect parents failed to take them for medication or
immunization, as it was allegedly against their faith.

She said it was the constitutional right of all Kenyans to have good
health and access to medical care. She warned that people who violate
the constitution by denying children access to health care on account
of religion would be arrested and prosecuted.

In early September [2011], police officers raided the home of a
Kavonokya sect adherent in Mwingi East district and rescued 3 sickly
children whom they forcefully took to hospital. A contingent of police
officers led by Mwingi OCS Jonathan Wafula was summoned to the home of
Mbevo Musili in Kyamwenze village in Mui division by the assistant
chief Julius Musyoka Mukiti after the brother of the sick children had
passed away as a result of measles infection on the previous day. The
Ngoo assistant chief had summoned the police after he earlier stormed
the home and stopped the burial of the Mui Secondary school student,
insisting that he would only issue a burial permit after the
deceased's 3 other sick siblings were taken for medical attention.

It turns out some suspected cases of measles were just that,
suspected, and not the real infection. As iNews880 reported last week,
Alberta Health Services (AHS) were awaiting test results of potential
secondary cases of measles, after one person tested positive for it.
Alberta Health Services confirms test results from all 3 [suspected]
cases have come back negative.

One person did test positive for measles, prompting AHS to send out a
warning to those who may have come into contact with that person at
Manulife Place, between 7am-9pm, 1-3 Nov 2011; the Synergy Fall Social
Event at Sutton Place Hotel, 3 Nov 2011, 5pm-9pm; or the emergency
room at University Hospital, 8 Nov 2011, 7:30pm and 9 Nov 2011,
4:30am.

Measles is highly contagious and potentially-deadly if you haven't
been immunized against it.

Alberta Health Services is still advising anyone showing such symptoms
as a fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and blotchy rash to get in
touch with Health Link Alberta, 780-408-LINK (5465) in Edmonton, or
toll-free, 1-866-408-LINK.

109 cases of [suspected] measles have been reported in the province of
Chimborazo, Of these, 106 were negative and 3 positive according to a
press release from the head of Epidemiology, Bureau of Health of
Chimborazo. The results for 7 other cases are pending.

To date, 89 percent of children 6 months to one year old and 84
percent of children one to 4 years of age have been registered as
vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella virus infection.

Meanwhile, the health authorities are continuing to vaccinate children
between 5 and 15 years of age. The confirmed cases are a child 5 years
old, a 3-year-old girl, and a 14-year-old boy. The 3 had not been
vaccinated against measles virus infection because of opposition from
their parents.

A student from the Orana Steiner School has been admitted to hospital
with measles, and at least 3 of his classmates have been diagnosed
with the illness. ACT [Australian Capital Territory] Chief Health
Officer Paul Kelly has written to parents at the school today [23 Nov
2011], saying: "We are asking parents of students at Orana School to
be alert to measles symptoms. The Health Protection Service has begun
contacting people believed to have been exposed, recommending post
exposure prophylaxis in line with national guidelines. Priority has
been given to contacting the households and those most recently
exposed contacts at GP surgeries and the Canberra Hospital. The
guidelines require the measles mumps and rubella vaccine to be given
within 3 days or normal human immunoglobulin within 6 days." Parents
of any unvaccinated students in the same class as the students with
measles are being asked to exclude their child from school until the
end of next week.

Symptoms of measles include fever, tiredness, runny nose, and a cough,
followed by a rash which appears 2-7 days later. People generally
develop symptoms 7-18 days after being exposed to a person with
infectious measles. Ten days is considered normal. About one in every
1000 people with measles develops encephalitis.

Orana deputy director Marie-Anne Gigon said the school was working
closely with the Health Directorate to halt the spread of measles
through the school.

From: The Canberra Times [abbreviated, edited]
http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/father-fears-more-exposed-to-measles-outbreak/2370322.aspx


A parent's 15-year-old daughter seems to be over the worst of a
suspected case of measles but is worried about how many other people
she may have inadvertently exposed to the disease. ''She still has a
really nasty cough, and her body is still covered in a rash, but it's
far less aggressive than it was 2 or 3 days ago."

The girl -- who has not been vaccinated against measles -- is a Year 9
student at the Orana Steiner School in Weston, where 4 of her
classmates have been diagnosed with the illness, and one has been
admitted to hospital. More cases are expected to be diagnosed, and
health authorities have the task of trying to contact everybody who
may have been in close contact with sufferers, including people who
may have sat next to them in medical waiting rooms.

The family was also concerned about the girl's 8-week-old daughter,
although the fact the baby was being breastfed by her vaccinated
mother was likely to offer strong protection against measles.

[Two cases of sub-acute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), one of whom
died, were reported among the more than 30 000 confirmed cases of
measles reported in Europe during 2011 so far. In addition, 8
measles-related deaths and 23 cases of acute measles encephalitis were
reported.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a chronic encephalitis
occurring after infection with measles virus. The prevalence of the
disease varies depending on uptake of measles vaccination, with the
virus disproportionally affecting regions with low vaccination rates.


SSPE is a progressive neurological disorder of children and young
adults that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is a slow but
persistent viral infection caused by defective measles virus. SSPE has
been reported from all parts of the world, but it is considered a rare
disease in developed countries, with in the past fewer than 10 cases
per year reported in the United States. The incidence of SSPE declined
by at least 90 percent in countries that have practiced widespread
immunization with measles vaccine.

The incidence of SSPE is still high in some developing countries.
There is a higher incidence among males than females (male/female:
3/1). Most youngsters with SSPE have a history of measles infection at
an early age, usually younger than 2 years followed by a latent period
of 6 to 8 years before neurological symptoms begin.

Despite the long interval between the measles infection and the onset
of SSPE, it is believed that the infection of the brain occurs soon
after the primary bout with measles and progresses slowly. The initial
symptoms of SSPE are subtle and include mild mental deterioration
(such as memory loss) and changes in behavior (such as irritability)
followed by disturbances in motor function, including uncontrollable
involuntary jerking movements of the head, trunk or limbs called
myoclonic jerks. Seizures may also occur. Some patients may become
blind. In advanced stages of the disease, individuals may lose the
ability to walk, as their muscles stiffen or spasm. There is
progressive deterioration to a comatose state and then to a persistent
vegetative state. Death is usually the result of fever, heart failure,
or the brain's inability to continue controlling the autonomic nervous
system.

Successful measles vaccination programmes directly and indirectly
protect the population against SSPE and have the potential to
eliminate SSPE through the elimination of measles. Epidemiological and
virological data suggest that measles vaccine does not cause SSPE
(Campbell H, Andrews N, Brown KE, Miller E. Int J Epidemiol. 2007
Dec;36(6):1334-48).
