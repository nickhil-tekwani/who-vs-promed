1st report of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ in Norway
-----------------------------------------------
In southwestern Norway, unusual symptoms were observed at the end of 2011 in one glasshouse of tomatoes located in the county of Rogaland. Affected plants showed small and narrow leaves, leaf yellowing and bronzing, as well as a stunted and bushy appearance. In January 2012, molecular tests confirmed the presence of _Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_.

In the affected glasshouse, the disease spread very rapidly: it was 1st observed in 3-4 plants in December 2011 and affected several hundred plants by the end of January 2012. In February and March [2012], symptoms could be observed on plants in all parts of the infected greenhouse.

All tomato plants were destroyed, and the whole site was disinfected and left empty for 8 weeks. It is now considered that the disease has been eradicated.

1st report of _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ in Slovenia
----------------------------------------------
In Slovenia, 14 samples were collected in 2011 from symptomless _Solanum jasminoides_ plants in greenhouses and retail trade. These samples were tested for the presence of viroids. Molecular tests confirmed the presence of _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (EPPO Alert List) in 7 samples, and of _Citrus exocortis viroid_ in 3 samples.

The situation of _Tomato apical stunt viroid_ in Slovenia can be described as follows: Present, detected in 2011 in a few samples of asymptomatic _Solanum jasminoides_.

[_Tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid_ (TCDVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) has been reported to cause serious yield losses in tomatoes, for example in Europe, in both field and glasshouse grown crops. Symptoms on tomato vary depending on TCDVd strain, tomato variety, age of the plant, and plant vigour. They resemble _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of the genus) symptoms and may include distortion, yellowing or bronzing of leaves and shoots, necrotic leaf lesions, stunting of plants, reduced number of leaves and fruit, and even death of plants.

Other solanaceous crops are also likely to be hosts, including capsicum and potato. Symptomless infection may occur in ornamentals such as petunia and verbena. Disease development and spread are favoured by warmer temperatures.

Little is known yet about epidemiology, host specificity and host-pathogen interactions of TCDVd, but it is expected that these are similar to PSTVd. Asymptomatic ornamentals and possibly solanaceous weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs. TCDVd, like most pospiviroids, can easily be transmitted mechanically, for example by contaminated pruning tools and equipment, human and insect activities and plant-to-plant contact, as well as by grafting. Seed transmission of TCDVd is strongly suspected; spread by pollen or specific insect vectors needs further investigation.

_Tomato apical stunt viroid_ (TASVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) has been included on the EPPO alert list. Few data were available on its host range. Symptoms in tomato may include stunting, leaf distortion, reduced fruit size and discolouration. Up to 100 percent incidence with heavy yield losses has been reported. The viroid is transmitted by plant material, mechanical means, seed, and bumblebees.

_Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd; genus _Pospiviroid_) can also infect tomato and other solanaceous crop and weed species. In tomato, symptoms may include chlorosis, discolouration, and distortion of leaves; flower and fruit production may cease, and plants may be stunted. However, severity of symptoms may vary.

The presence of pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts, such as _S. jasminoides_ (see link below) has been reported from several countries (see, for example, ProMED-mail post no. 20080221.0707) and must be considered a threat to crops. It highlights the importance of systematic surveys and quarantine measures for these pathogens, even if there are no obvious problems with crops.

Disease management of these viroids in tomato crops may include use of certified clean tomato seeds or explants, removal of pathogen reservoirs and phytosanitary measures. For glasshouse crops, reduction of insect numbers may also be helpful.
