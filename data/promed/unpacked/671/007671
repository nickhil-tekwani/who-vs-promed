An anthrax outbreak has been reported in the Bazarkorganskiy
district of the Jalalabad region. Quarantine measures have
been initiated in several villages.

Starting on 8 Oct 2005 at 8 a.m., the "Epizootiya" plan was
introduced in this district of the Jalalabad region, which
requires closing milk, meat, and livestock markets. This
information came from the Ministry of Internal Affairs,
dated 10 Oct 2005.
According to a report dated 7 Oct, the Bazarkorganskiy
district state veterinary department, starting from 27 Sep
up until 6 Oct, 9 people were taken to the Batken hospital
with symptoms of anthrax. These patients were from the
villages of Beshbadam, Pravda, Chkalov, Ogantala, Charbak,
and Jon.

Veterinarians are tracing people who had consumed meat from
"ill animal." [Singular or plural?].

[Starting 7 Oct 2005, the district state authority
introduced quarantine. Central Asia for some reason may have
anthrax cases later in the year than other northern latitude
countries, for reasons that escape me. Merely from the look
of this report, meat from a number of slaughtered sick
animals at an unknown number of varied (?) sites found its
way to various markets in the district, with both
slaughtermen and consumers put at risk. - Mod.MHJ]
