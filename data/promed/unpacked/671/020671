[re: ProMED-mail Spotted fever, fatal - Brazil: (MG) 20110402.1027]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The following background data on spotted fever in Brazil are
abstracted from the Gideon e-book series (1,2). (Primary references
are available on request).

Time and place
--------------
- Rickettsial spotted fever is known locally as Brazilian spotted
fever, Sao Paulo fever, and febre maculosa brasileira.
- Rickettsial spotted fever was first reported in Brazil in 1920.
- Cases are reported in Minas Gerais, Bahia, Goias, Rio Grande do
Sul, and Espirito Santo.
- The disease has re-emerged in Rio de Janeiro in recent years.

Disease incidence and rates per 100 000 are depicted in the graph
which can be seen at
http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/Brazil-SF.jpg.
Between 6 and 27 fatal cases per year were registered during 2007 to
2010.

Geographical notes
------------------
- Outbreaks were reported in Minas Gerais during 1929 to 1944, but
not during 1945 to 1980.
- Subsequent outbreaks were reported in Minas Gerais in 1981, 1984,
1992, 1995, and 2000.
- 92 cases (40 per cent fatal) were confirmed in Minas Gerais during
1981 to 1989; 78 during 1992 to 1997 (including 3 fatal cases in 1996,
and 2 in 1997).
- 67 cases were reported in Sao Paulo during 1985 to 2000; 224
(including 6 case-clusters) during 2001 to 2008 5; 5949 suspected
cases (206 confirmed) during 2003 to 2006.
- 17 cases (8 fatal) were reported in Pedreira county, Sao Paulo
during 1985 to 1995.
- 5 fatal cases were reported in Sao Paulo State in 2003.
- 8 outbreaks were reported in Sao Paulo State during 2005.
- A case of eschar-associated spotted fever rickettsiosis (species
not determined) was reported in Bahia in 2007.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 1.3 per cent of _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ ticks in metropolitan
Sao Paulo were infected by _Rickettsia rickettsii_ (2009
publication).
- 1.3 per cent of _Amblyomma cajennense_ in Minas Gerais (1997
publication).
- _Rickettsia parkeri_ was identified in 9.7 per cent of _Amblyomma
triste_ (a non-human biting tick) in Pauliceia County, Sao Paulo
(2005).

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 10.6 per cent of healthy students and 4.11 per cent of dogs in the
endemic areas of Minas Gerais (1998).
- 38.4 per cent of humans, 7.6 per cent of dogs and 25.9 per cent of
horses (Espirito Santo, _Rickettsia_ spp., 2010 publication).
- 77.3 per cent of horses and 31.3 per cent of dogs in Pedreira
Municipality, Sao Paulo State (2001).
- 1.6 per cent of healthy persons in Minas Gerais (2005
publication).
- 25.7 per cent of dogs in southern Brazil (_Rickettsia parkeri_,
2002 to 2003).
- 69.6 per cent of dogs in metropolitan Sao Paulo (2009
publication).
- 4.4 per cent of dogs from Sao Jose dos Pinhais, Parana State (2006
to 2007).

Reservoirs
----------
- The principal reservoir hosts are capybara (_Hydrochaeris
hydrochaeris_), horses and occasionally dogs.
- Natural infection has been identified in dogs in Sao Paulo.
- _Rickettsia parkeri_ antibodies have been documented in dogs from
urban areas in the western Brazilian Amazon (Monte Negro, Rondonia).

Vectors
-------
- The principal vectors are _Amblyomma aureolatum_ (areas of Sao
Paulo) and _A. cajennense_.
- _A. cooperi_ has also been implicated (in Sao Paulo).
- Spotted fever-group rickettsiae have been found in _Rhipicephalus
sanguineus_ in Rio de Janeiro state.
