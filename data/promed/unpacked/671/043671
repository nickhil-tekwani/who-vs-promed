Hundreds of children have been hospitalized in Houston-area [Harris County, Texas] hospitals suffering from a highly contagious respiratory virus that's proving more troublesome than the flu.

Officials with Texas Children's Hospital tell the Houston Chronicle that more than 600 patients tested positive in December [2013] for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. More than 140 pediatric patients have been submitted to Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital since October [2013].

RSV infects the lungs and breathing passages and generally strikes during the winter months. The illness causes influenza-like symptoms and can be life-threatening to infants.

The number of flu patients seen at both hospitals was significantly lower. Health experts say it's difficult to pinpoint why RSV affects more patients, but argue it may be due in part to the lack of a vaccine to prevent the virus.

[Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections are most common in children during the colder months of the year. Mod.CP provided a helpful comment about RSV and its infections (ProMED-mail archive no. 20131025.2021165): "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is highly communicable, but humans are the only known reservoir. The incubation period varies from 2 to 8 days. The virus is spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons via respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. By 2 years of age, nearly all children have been infected by RSV at least once. Previous infection by RSV may confer only partial immunity to RSV, and so individuals may be infected repeatedly with the same or different strains of RSV.

"Predisposing factors for RSV infection include prematurity, cardiopulmonary disease, and immunodeficiency, and may also include other factors such as tobacco exposure, day care attendance, overcrowding, lack of breastfeeding, and admission to hospital during the RSV season. Epidemics in care homes for elderly people have been common in some years.

"Two major subtypes (A and B) have been identified based on structural variations in the G protein, and an increasing number of distinct genotypes are in circulation. The predominance of a subtype changes over successive seasons, but so far has not been associated with disease severity."
