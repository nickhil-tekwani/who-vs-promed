Mambau Primary School in Mambasa sensitized on handwashing
--------------------------
- The subdivision of Primary and Technical Primary Education Mambasa 1 in Ituri sensitized on Thu 17 Oct 2019 567 students from Mambau Primary School on handwashing and its importance.
- This ceremony is part of the response against the #Ebola virus disease in the Mambasa sub-coordination led by Dr. Celestin Mwanzembe. A total of 567 students, including 273 girls and 17 teachers, among whom 7 were women, were sensitized during this activity;
- The director of this school, Mr. Michel Zongoli, who congratulated this initiative taken by school authorities, asked that this kind of activities be carried out in all the schools of the territory of Mambasa;
- At the end of this awareness, 15 complete handwashing kits, a large batch of soaps, and 2 sanitation kits were given to this school by the subdivision for the sustainability of this awareness;
- "Dear Parents and Teachers: You are the important link in the Ebola response to the Ebola epidemic. Controlling the epidemic involves your commitment to supporting all pillars of the response. However, nothing can be done without information. Alert us as soon as possible so that suspicious cases are isolated and taken care of quickly. This ensures the survival of the suspect and the non-contamination of the rest of the community. Together we will defeat Ebola. Pamoja tutaweza #Ebola," said WHO monitoring team leader Dr. Thierry Kalonji after the briefing.

Description of probable cases
------------------
For the probable case of Mambasa notified on 5 Oct 2019:
- This is a 34-year-old woman who died in the Binase health zone (AS) in Brazza district of Mambasa, Ituri province. This woman was not listed as a contact and was not vaccinated;

[Note the 2 cases described above were unvaccinated and not listed as contacts. Herein lies one of the major problems in controlling Ebola. If only known contacts are vaccinated (rather than a village) and furthermore, if patients go to traditional doctors, the virus will continue to spread. It is a very difficult situation requiring education and cooperation of the villagers. - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak summaries

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

WHO advisors extend Ebola emergency, European regulators conditionally approve vaccine
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In a pair of major Ebola developments today [Fri 18 Oct 2019], an emergency committee for the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended extending the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) for the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and European drug regulators conditionally approved Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine.

Meanwhile, 3 new Ebola infections were confirmed in the DRC today, raising the outbreak total to 3233, according to the WHO's online Ebola dashboard.

PHEIC continuation reflects ongoing insecurity worries

The WHO's emergency committee met for the 5th time today to discuss outbreak developments. When the group last met in July [2019], it recommended declaring a PHEIC under International Health Regulations. The group heard updates from the DRC, Uganda, and Tanzania, as well as from global health officials.

Along with a continuing slowdown in cases over the past several weeks, the number of affected health zones has dropped, and the epidemic is centered in the Biakato Mine area of the Mandima health zone, an area challenging for outbreak responders due to its remote locations and insecurity problems, partly related to the presence of both legal and illegal mines.

According to a statement from the WHO, the group got the latest risk assessment from the WHO, which says the risk of Ebola spread is still high at the national and regional levels, but low at the global level. The committee also received updates on preparedness in neighboring countries and on the Ebola vaccine campaign.

They learned that funding is still a problem, especially for preparedness in 9 surrounding countries for which only USD 4.5 million of USD 66.6 million has been pledged by donors. The committee praised neighboring countries' efforts to boost preparedness, but they said they are deeply concerned about the lack of sustained financial support for the activities.

More than a year into the outbreak, access and security issues pose obstacles to final efforts to eliminate Ebola, and the group's view is that the event still constitutes a PHEIC. They recommended a few changes in the temporary recommendations they made in earlier meetings, including establishing community awareness activities in areas in the outbreak region that haven't had transmission, and stepped-up active surveillance.

At a media telebriefing afterward, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus, PhD said he accepted the group's recommendation and that the emergency committee will meet again in about 3 months to assess if the conditions still warrant a PHEIC.

"This remains a dangerous and complex outbreak. We need the full force of our partners to bring the outbreak under control," he said.

Tedros said he is pleased by the progress since the group's last meeting, including that no countries have imposed travel or trade restrictions, expanded screening, and contact tracing and that no forward transmission has occurred in Goma or Uganda. He urged caution in interpreting the continued drop in cases, especially given the rural, difficult-to-reach location of the recent cases. "We must treat every case as if it's the 1st," Tedros added.

EMA nod paves way for full licensing
---------------------
In another key development, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended conditional approval for Merck's VSV-EBOV vaccine, which will be authorized under the ERVEBO brand name and indicated for active immunization of people 18 years and older to protect against Ebola.

As the next step, the European Commission will consider authorization on an accelerated basis, and if approved, the vaccine will be cleared for use in 28 countries that are part of the European Union as well as in European Economic Area countries including Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.

The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is currently reviewing the vaccine.

Roger Perlmutter, MD, PhD, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement today, "Our work would not have been possible without the efforts of countless numbers of people, especially those from the World Health Organization and many other government and non-governmental organizations, who have worked tirelessly on the development of this important vaccine." He added that a top priority is achieving registration of the Merck manufacturing site in Germany that makes the vaccine.

In a statement today, the WHO said today's [Fri 18 Oct 2019] EMA announcement marks a major milestone, and that while the EC decides on licensing, it will move towards prequalifying the vaccine.

Tedros said in the statement that the EMA's conditional authorization is a triumph for public health. "My deepest gratitude is to the studies' volunteers, researchers, and health workers in Guinea, other countries, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo who have put themselves at risk to ensure people are protected with this vaccine," he said.

The WHO said a unique feature of the EMA review was that WHO and African regulators actively participated through a cooperative arrangement put in place by the WHO, which it said will help speed the vaccine's registration in the most at-risk countries.

The WHO said it is working a plan with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and other partners to establish vaccine stockpiles to prepare for future outbreaks. Today's [Fri 18 Oct 2019] announcement won't impact current vaccine activities in the DRC, and the WHO projected that licensed doses will be available in the middle of 2020.

At today's media briefing, Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of health emergencies, said having a licensed vaccine will reduce logistical barriers and allow manufacturers to move to full-scale manufacturing, 2 factors that are expected to improve the supply of VSV-EBOV.

Latest cases include probable infections
----------------------------
Aside from 3 new lab-confirmed cases reported today, the WHO's online dashboard reflects 2 more probable cases, putting the overall outbreak total at 3233. Health officials are still investigating 443 suspected cases.

One more person died from Ebola, lifting the fatality count to 2157.

Meanwhile, the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) in its latest daily update had locations for the single Ebola case reported yesterday [Thu 17 Oct 2019], a patient from Mabalako. It also noted that 4 of the most recent deaths were all from Mabalako, one that occurred in the community and 3 that happened in the Ebola treatment center.

- Fri 18 Oct 2019. WHO-supported Ebola vaccine
[WHO, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/18-10-2019-major-milestone-for-who-supported-ebola-vaccine

The World Health Organization (WHO) welcomes the European Medicines Agency (EMA) announcement recommending a conditional marketing authorization for the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine, which has been shown to be effective in protecting people from the Ebola virus.

Today's [Fri 18 Oct 2019] announcement by EMA, the European agency responsible for the scientific evaluation of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies, is a key step before the European Commission decision on licensing. In parallel, WHO will move towards prequalification of the vaccine.

"The conditional authorization of the world's 1st Ebola vaccine is a triumph for public health and a testimony to the unprecedented collaboration between scores of experts worldwide," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. "My deepest gratitude is to the studies' volunteers, researchers, and health workers in Guinea, other countries, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo who have put themselves at risk to ensure people are protected with this vaccine."

In the past 5 years, WHO has convened experts to review the evidence on various Ebola vaccine candidates, informed policy recommendations, and mobilized a multilateral coalition to accelerate clinical evaluations. The EMA review was unique in that WHO and African regulators actively participated through an innovative cooperative arrangement put in place by WHO, which will help accelerate registration for the countries most at risk.

A randomized trial for the vaccine began during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2015. When no other organization was positioned to run a trial in Guinea during the complex emergency, the government of Guinea and WHO took the unusual step to lead the trial.

A global coalition of funders and researchers provided the critical support required. Funders included the Canadian Government (through the Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Institutes of Health Research, International Development Research Centre, Global Affairs Canada); the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (through the Research Council of Norway's GLOBVAC programme); the Wellcome Trust; the UK government through the Department for International Development; and Medecins Sans Frontieres.

The trial was successfully run using an innovative ring vaccination design. In the 1970s, this ring strategy helped to eradicate smallpox, but this was the 1st time that an experimental vaccine was evaluated this way.

WHO celebrates the commitment and sacrifices made by so many over the last 5 years, an international effort that led to this landmark moment in public health. The difficult and painstaking work was undertaken by a global team of researchers, health workers, partners, regulators, governments, and field workers from logisticians to vaccinators, and finally, local communities. Together they overcame many obstacles. WHO also recognizes the Canadian government contribution to the early development of this vaccine.

Anticipating that in coming years there will be higher Ebola vaccine demand during and between outbreaks, WHO is working with Gavi, UNICEF, and other partners to develop a Global Ebola Vaccines Security Plan, as increased supply capacity and multiple manufacturers will be needed in the short- to medium-term to meet this demand and ensure vaccine security.

There are 8 vaccines undergoing clinical evaluation. WHO continues to work with partners towards an internationally coordinated governing mechanism to ensure access according to risk criteria, and manage supply and stockpiles, especially as supply will remain limited until a full manufacturing capacity is established or other vaccines are licensed.

A roadmap aiming to accelerate prequalification and coordinate actions and contributions to the licensing and roll-out of the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in African countries has been developed.

This announcement will not have an immediate effect on how the vaccine is accessed or administered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as licensing has not yet occurred, and licensed doses will only be available mid-2020. The vaccine will continue to be used in the country under a research protocol (also known as "expanded access" or "compassionate use"), and with the ring vaccination strategy.

In the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, more than 236 000 people have been vaccinated with rVSV ZEBOV GP donated by Merck to WHO, including more than 60 000 health and frontline workers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in Uganda, South Sudan, Rwanda, and Burundi.

"This vaccine has already saved many lives in the current Ebola outbreak, and the decision by European regulator will help it to eventually save many more," said Dr Tedros, WHO director-general. "I am proud of the role WHO has played, from supporting the research, to conducting the trial in Guinea in 2015."

[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/17-october-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The number of confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been relatively low in recent weeks, with 15 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the epidemiological week of 7-13 Oct [2019] (Figure 1). These encouraging signs are offset by a marked increase in case incidence in Biakato Mine health area, Mandima health zone. During the past 21 days (from 25 Sep-15 Oct [2019]), a total of 50 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), of which 2/3 (62%, n=31) were reported from or had transmission links to Biakato Mine health area.

Issues with access and security are impacting case finding and investigations, contact tracing, safe and dignified burials, decontamination of affected residences, and vaccination rings in parts of Mandima health zone. This is reflected in the decline in the proportion of confirmed cases listed as contacts (from 57% to 13%) and increase in the proportion of cases dying outside of Ebola treatment centres or transit centres (from 14% to 27%) this past week. This is further demonstrated by the relatively low numbers of alerts reported in the 2 areas over the past 42 days, with 32% less than the expected number.

A recent qualitative investigation in these health zones indicated that there is poor understanding among the population and local health workers of the transmission mechanism and symptoms of the disease, compounded with an environment of mistrust surrounding the origin of the disease, and reason for vaccination. This may impact the reporting of cases and engagement with response activities. Less than half of the respondents indicated that they would call a hotline if a member of their community was suspected of having Ebola, and almost half reported that they would encourage a family member to go to a treatment/transit centre if they were suspected of having Ebola.

Furthermore, less than half of individuals interviewed understood the functions of different interventions in the response, and less than 5% were involved in the response. This investigation highlights the importance of engaging communities in response activities in the upcoming weeks.

As of 15 Oct [2019], a total of 3227 EVD cases were reported, including 3113 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2154 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1811) were female, 28% (n=918) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=162) were health workers.

The director-general will reconvene the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR), as 3 months have passed since the declaration of the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 17 Jul [2019]. The committee will review progress in the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued by the director-general on 17 Jul [2019], discuss whether the event still constitutes a PHEIC, and, if yes, advise for new or updated Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. The current recommendations are available at https://www.who.int/ihr/en/, as will be the upcoming statement.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 140 million for WHO. As of 17 Oct 2019, USD 69.5 million has been received by WHO, with additional funds committed or pledged. Further resources are needed to fully fund the response through to December 2019 and into Q1 2020.

Under Pillar 5, Regional Preparedness, the funding requirement for all partners is USD 66 million, of which WHO requires USD 21 million. As of 17 Oct 2019, WHO has received USD 4.3 million. While some additional pledges are in the pipeline, increased funding for preparedness in neighboring countries is urgently needed. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/ebola/drc-2019/funding.

- Fri 18 Oct 2019. Ituri (Biakato): rampage
[Radio Okapi, Google trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/10/18/actualite/sante/ituri-interpellation-de-6-suspects-impliques-dans-le-saccage-des-centres

Six people suspected of being involved in the ransacking of health centers organizing Ebola response activities were arrested on Thu 17 Oct in Biakato (Ituri). Police say they detained these people for investigative reasons.

On Wednesday night to Thursday [16-17 Oct 2019], 4 health facilities in Biakato were targeted. According to medical sources, these men attacked the response devices following rumors surrounding the death of a resident at the Mangina treatment center.

It was around 7 p.m. that a group of mainly young people invaded 4 health facilities from Biakato center to Mupanda and Bandikindu in the Babila Teturi group in charge of Babila babombi. These are Bora Uzima health posts, Ushindi, Bismillah Clinic, and Grace Pediatrics.

According to the testimony of some human rights activists who went there on Thursday [17 Oct 2019], these protesters 1st ransacked all the handwashing devices and isolated posts of suspected cases of Ebola. They then threatened to kill the head of Bora Uzima health post.

The latter was saved thanks to the intervention of one of his men, who dissuaded his companions on the pretext that this nurse is not a member of the response team.

Police say they have already apprehended 6 suspects. She says for the moment that the situation is relatively calm in Biakato center. However, the police are asking the population to alert the security forces in time to prevent violence against the response team in the area.

- Thu 17 Oct 2019. Sweden preparedness
[Contagion Alive, abridged, edited]
https://www.contagionlive.com/

The outbreak of Ebola virus disease continues in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), as cases surpass 3210, with 2146 deaths. For many, this outbreak is a stark reminder of why continued readiness and public health infrastructure is critical. For those in healthcare, it is a painful reminder of the long days spent preparing one's healthcare facility to rapidly identify, isolate, and treat a patient who could potentially have the viral hemorrhagic fever.

More recently, a European hospital experienced a reminder that continued preparedness is vital when a patient in southern Sweden's Skane University Hospital sought care after returning from an affected area. The patient has not been identified, but they arrived at the hospital last Monday [30 Sep 2019]. Following the algorithms provided by the World Health Organization and other public health agencies, the hospital placed the patient in isolation when it was discovered that they not only had relevant travel history to an affected area, but also a fever. This algorithm has been active since 2014: symptoms plus travel = isolate until things can be ruled out. In coordination with public health officials, healthcare workers at the Swedish hospital drew samples and sent them for analysis, which yielded the results we all like to hear: negative for Ebola virus disease.

While this was a fortunate situation, it should be seen as a reminder to those of us in healthcare, especially infection prevention, to conduct an internal audit to see how well the training and process mapping has persevered since 2014. Despite the efforts that were put in place nationally, like the tiered healthcare approach to special pathogens, many in frontline facilities struggle to maintain readiness.

In a paper published in Health Security in April 2019, I wrote: "Since the EVD [Ebola virus disease] cases in Dallas, Texas, the continuity of hospital preparedness has been questionable. While certain hospitals were designated as EVD treatment facilities, the readiness of most American hospitals remains unknown. A gap analysis of a hospital system in Phoenix, Arizona, underscores the challenges of maintaining infectious disease preparedness in the existing US healthcare system."

While many hospital administrators might cite that they are more prepared than they were in 2014, 1/3 of administrators were unaware of where their hospital fell on the tiered framework. For those designated treatment facilities, the cost was roughly USD 1.2 million to create and prepare their biocontainment units. A bigger issue though, is that the financial cost of preparing all healthcare facilities is considerable. In fact, in a recently issued Office of the Inspector General report, hospital administrators note that the financial cost of preparedness diverts resources from other critical hospital efforts and for a "what if" situation, has many concerned.

Ultimately the scenario in Sweden played out with the best possible outcome: the patient did not have Ebola virus disease. Many hospitals in the United States have also quietly managed patients under investigation for special pathogens. The truth is that we should see what happened in Sweden as a not-so-gentle reminder to continue training for basic infection prevention efforts, by asking travel-screening questions and using proper isolation precautions, while also working to re-educate staff on Ebola personal protective equipment and processes.

- Wed 16 Oct 2019. Goma: water
[NPR, abridged, edited]
https://www.npr.org/2019/10/16/770712198/residents-in-goma-are-struggling-to-gather-water-while-fighting-ebola
[Byline: Eyder Peralta]

The Congolese city of Goma sits on the giant Lake Kivu. But the city has been without running water for years. Residents talk about the challenge of gathering water when they're also fighting Ebola.

Audie Cornish, Host: Health workers in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been fighting an outbreak of the Ebola virus for more than a year. The World Health Organization calls it a public health emergency of international concern. But for many living in the city of Goma, near the center of this outbreak, there are more basic concerns, like a lack of running water. NPR's Eyder Peralta reports.

Eyder Peralta: Goma sits right on the shores of a huge freshwater lake. But the city of 2 million people hasn't had running water for years. So in the mornings, just as the sun rises, men, women and children walk miles to collect water. Pascal Bitisimba is 12. The yellow jerrycan that he's carrying is half his size.

Pascal Bitisimba: (Through interpreter) Of course, this takes me much of my time. Instead of going to study, I come 1st to check water.

Peralta: His whole life, he has never seen running water. Nelisse Kakulia, who came down to the lake to fetch water, can't hide her disgust. Kids drown here all the time, she says. The water isn't treated. The lake lets out methane bubbles that can kill.

Nelisse Kakulia: (Through interpreter) This is unacceptable.

Peralta: And the irony of it makes her angry every day. Goma hosts the largest UN peacekeeping mission in the world. Dozens of charity organizations invest millions every month here. And this is a region brimming with mineral riches. So when she thinks about having to walk to the lake every day, she seethes.
