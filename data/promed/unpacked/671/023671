Angola: Marburg virus disease - WHO Update as of 23 Mar 2005
-------------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have identified Marburg virus as the causative agent in an
outbreak of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in Angola. Virus was detected
on Mon 21 Mar 2005 in samples from nine of twelve fatal cases. Retrospective
analysis has now identified 102 cases in the outbreak, which dates back to
October 2004. Of these cases, 95 have been fatal. Most cases are presently
concentrated in Uige Province in the northern part of the country (a map of
the location of the outbreak can be accessed via
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2005_03_23/en/>).
Since the start of the outbreak, the monthly number of cases has
progressively increased, but this increase could be the result of
intensified surveillance. Around 75% of cases have occurred in children
under the age of 5 years. Cases in adults include a small number of health
care workers. Marburg virus disease has no vaccine or curative treatment,
and can be rapidly fatal. In the present outbreak, most deaths have occurred
between 3 to 7 days following the onset of symptoms. Past outbreaks indicate
that close contact with bodily fluids of infected people, as may occur in
health care settings or during burial practices, increases the risk of
infection.
WHO is supporting efforts by the Ministry of Health in Angola to strengthen
infection control in hospitals, to intensify case detection and contact
tracing, and to improve public understanding of the disease and its modes of
transmission.
Background
----------
Marburg virus disease is an acute febrile illness accompanied by severe
haemorrhagic manifestations. The disease has an incubation period of 3 to 9
days. In the earliest stage of infection, symptoms are non-specific and may
be easily confused with more common diseases, including malaria, yellow
fever, and typhoid fever. A severe watery diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea
and vomiting are early symptoms, as are severe chest and lung pains, sore
throat, and cough. A high proportion of cases develop severe haemorrhagic
manifestations between days 5 and 7, most frequently affecting the
gastrointestinal tract and the lungs. A characteristic rash usually appears
at this time, sometimes involving the whole body.
The disease was first identified in 1967 during simultaneous outbreaks
affecting laboratory workers in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The outbreaks, which involved 31 cases and seven
deaths, were subsequently linked to contact with infected monkeys imported
from Uganda. The virus then disappeared until February 1975, when an acutely
ill man with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe was admitted to a hospital
in South Africa. Infection spread from the man to his travelling companion
and a nurse at the hospital. The man died, but the other two cases
recovered. In 1980, two cases, one of which was fatal, occurred in Kenya. In
1987, an additional single case, which was fatal, occurred in Kenya. The
largest outbreak on record, which occurred from late 1998 to late 2000 in
the Democratic Republic of Congo, involved 149 cases, of which 123 were
fatal. The outbreak was initially concentrated in workers at a gold mine in
Durba.
Marburg virus disease occurs very rarely and appears to be geographically
confined to a small number of countries in the southern part of the African
continent. When cases do occur, the disease has epidemic potential, as it
can spread from person to person, most often during the care of patients.
For this reason, strict measures for infection control need to be applied
during the management of cases. Containment of an outbreak of Marburg virus
disease also requires the rapid tracing and isolation of contacts. Health
education is needed to inform communities of the risks associated with
traditional burial practices. Despite intensive investigations extending
over several years, research has failed to find an animal reservoir of the
virus or determine where it hides in nature between outbreaks.
