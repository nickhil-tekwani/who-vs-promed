CALIFORNIA SCIENTISTS HOPE TO CURB SHARPSHOOTERS WITH PARASITIC WASP
California agriculture's newest weapon in its war on the glassy-winged
sharpshooter, which threatens to spread the Pierce's disease pathogen to
grapes and other major crops, is a pinhead-size parasitic wasp with no
sting.
The one-sixteenth-inch wasp, _Gonatocerus triguttatus_, is native to
north-central Mexico and southern Texas. Researchers hope it will attack
the eggs of the sharpshooter and help bring it under control. It is being
released initially in Riverside County, where Temecula Valley vineyards have
been damaged heavily by Pierce's disease. Vicki Helmar, San Joaquin County
assistant agricultural commissioner, applauded the move, stating, "Any
effective tool you have in the fight against the sharpshooter is good news."
Grapes, the county's leading cash crop, worth $291.2 million in 1999, are
susceptible to Pierce's disease, an incurable, fatal plant ailment that can
be spread by sharpshooters. Other major California crops at risk include
almonds, peaches, nectarines, plums and alfalfa.
Larry Bezark, a senior environmental research scientist with the state
Department of Food and Agriculture was cited as saying that by itself, the
parasitic wasp will not exterminate the sharpshooter, but it may help reduce
populations of the pest, adding, "It's one of several control options that
we have to suppress populations of the sharpshooter," he said.
The glassy-winged sharpshooter invaded Southern California about 10 years
ago and now occurs in such high numbers in the region that it is considered
impossible to eradicate.

[Hopefully biological control of the sharpshooter will reduce the number of
sharpshooters, and thus lower the likelihood of spread of the bacterium to
healthy plants of susceptible crops. The strategy is a complex one, given
that sharpshooters can acquire the bacterial vector, _Xylella fastidiosa_,
from any of several susceptible crops. The strategy will not eradicate the
vector but it should reduce the incidence of new infections. We can only
hope that there will be considerable success using this form of biological
control. - Mod.DH
