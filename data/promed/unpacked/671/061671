With the [ebolavirus] issue appearing to be over, health authorities
are battling at least one, maybe 2 different outbreaks [of hepatitis
E] in Karamoja.

The Ministry of Health yesterday [7 Jun 2011] confirmed an outbreak
of the viral liver disease where cases had been confirmed in Kaabong,
Moroto, and Kotido districts of the Karamoja sub-region of Uganda.

According to Kaabong district health officer Dr James Kisambu, a
total of 908 cases of hepatitis E had been reported in the affected
districts and were admitted at Kaabong Hospital.

Medical teams have been dispatched to the region to provide support,
and samples were taken from several suspected cases for testing at the
Uganda Virus Research Institute in Entebbe.

In addition to the outbreak above, New Vision reports that the
ministry was also investigating reports of a suspected outbreak of
yellow fever in Karamoja.

The clinical course of hepatitis E is similar to that of hepatitis A,
with no chronic form of the disease. Jaundice, fever, loss of
appetite, and lethargy are common symptoms.

People get infected primarily through the fecal-oral route, usually
through contaminated water or food. There have been several cases of
hepatitis E infection in France due to eating raw figatellu [a fresh
sausage], which is made from pig liver.

Much like hepatitis A, the fatality rate is low, with the exception
of pregnant women, where it can reach 20 percent among those infected
in the 3rd trimester. Liver failure is a frequent outcome with
pregnant women.

Hepatitis E is found endemically in countries that have inadequate
environmental sanitation. It is most frequently seen in Asia, Africa,
Central America, and the Middle East.

[Outbreaks of hepatitis E virus infection have been reported in
Karamoja region since early last year (2010) (see ProMED EAFR report 20100227.205783). The outbreaks at the time were attributed to
inappropriate disposal of faecal matter in the region and inadequate
access to safe water. The resurgence of these cases in the region is
an indication that the underlying risk factors have not been
addressed, and, therefore, a decisive response is still pending.

This report also mentions the possibility of a yellow fever outbreak
in the region. Clinically, yellow fever and acute viral hepatitis are
almost indistinguishable. However, the epidemiological investigations
commissioned by the national authorities should be able to determine
whether there is another outbreak in the region in addition to that of
hepatitis E virus.

It is, however, unlikely that up to 908 cases are admitted in
hospital, as the disease is largely a mild infection except in
pregnant women infected in the 3rd trimester; hence, during outbreaks,
most patients will not require admission.

[Outbreaks of hepatitis E virus infections are usually due to fecal
contamination of water rather than of food stuffs, which would more
likely result in more isolated cases. Proper disposal of fecal matter
is a challenge in situations where facilities and local customs do not
support it. Public health education is needed. - Mod.TY]
