Fumes from oil used in sewing machines caused 7 workers at a garment
factory in the capital's Russey Keo district to faint yesterday [28
Nov
2011] afternoon, a union leader and company representative said.

Hai Soveth, factory president of the Free Trade Union of Workers of
Cambodia, said 7 female workers at a facility run by Su Tong Fang
Group
Ying Kan were sent to Calmette Hospital yesterday [28 Nov 2011]
evening
after they fainted from the fumes.

About 900 workers were sent home at about 4:00 pm to avoid a repeat
of
the mass fainting incidents that hit other factories, Hai Soveth
said.

A 27-year-old woman, said she felt dizzy and weak in the knees and
that
her chest tightened before she began vomiting from the fumes.

"My health was weak and when I smelled oil it made me dizzy and I
vomited," she said from the hospital. "My friends carried me out and
sent me to the hospital," she said, adding that this was the 1st time
this had happened at the factory.

San Chhinh, an administrative officer at the factory, said the
workers
who fainted had recovered.

They fainted because the factory had switched the oil it used for
sewing
machines, she said, adding and that it would go back to the oil it
had
used before. "Most workers will be back on the job today," she said.

Yi Kanitha, deputy director of the occupational health department at
the
Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training, said he was unaware of
yesterday's [28 Nov 2011] fainting incident a the factory.

Female workers were rushed to hospital in a 2nd mass fainting
yesterday
[29 Nov 2011] at Su Tong Fang Ying Kam garment factory in Russey Keo
district, unionists said.

About 17 female workers became overwhelmed with diesel fumes from
their
sewing machines and were rushed to Calmette Hospital, where 7 of
their
co-workers are still being treated after Monday's [28 Nov 2011] mass
fainting, Ben Sreyleak of the Free Trade Union said.

"Seven of the workers who fainted [on 29 Nov 2011] are very serious
because they have heart-disease," Ben Sreyleak said.

Despite another mass fainting, one day after 900 workers were sent
home
on Monday [28 Nov 2011] to avoid repeated mass faintings, production
at
the Su Tong Fang Ying Kam garment factory continued yesterday [29 Nov
2011].

Ministry of Labour health department director Pok Vanthat said he and
many other experts, investigated Su Tong Fang Ying Kam yesterday [29
Nov
2011] after the mass fainting.

"I am still unclear about the causes of fainting, but according to
our
research, the main problem is the factory ventilation system," Pok
Vanthat said.

[The newswires above report 2 mass fainting incidents in female
workers
at Su Tong Fang Ying Kam garment factory in Russey Keo district,
Phnom
Penh. The 1st mass faintings occurred in 7 workers on 28 Nov 2011,
with
symptoms of dizziness, breathing difficulty and vomiting. The 2nd
incident occurred in 17 workers on 29 Nov 2011. Of these 17 workers,
7
people are in serious condition.

The newswire mentions that diesel fumes from sewing machines caused
the
workers to faint. It should be noted that the factory had switched
the
oil used for sewing machines before the 1st incident. However, it is
not
clear whether there was a switch in brand of lubricating oil vs
accidental use of fuel oil. The authority has not confirmed the
causes
of the incidents yet.

Diesel oil is a commonly used fuel. The type and severity of symptoms
vary depending on the amount of chemical involved and the nature of
the
exposure. Fuel oil poisoning occurs when someone swallows, breathes
in,
or touches fuel oil. The poisonous ingredients are hydrocarbons
(alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics), see
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002895.htm.

PRO/MBDS would greatly appreciate further information from
knowledgeable
sources regarding the results of the investigation on these mass
fainting incidents at Su Tong Fang Ying Kam garment factory,
Cambodia.
