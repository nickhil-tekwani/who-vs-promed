Plague - Madagascar
-------------------
The Ministry of Health of Madagascar has notified WHO of an outbreak of plague. The 1st case was identified on 17 Aug 2015 in a rural township in Moramanga district [Alaotra-Mangoro region, Toamasina province]. The case passed away on 19 Aug 2015. As of 30 Aug 2015, 14 cases, including 10 deaths, were reported. All confirmed cases are of the pneumonic form. Since 27 Aug 2015, no new cases have been reported from the affected or neighboring districts.

Public health response
----------------------
The national task force has been activated to manage the outbreak. With support from partners -- including WHO and the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar -- the government of Madagascar is implementing thorough public health measures, including active case and contact finding, provision of chemoprophylaxis, case and contact management, enhanced epidemiologic surveillance, infection prevention and control (house disinfection), vector control activities, social mobilization, coordination and resource mobilization.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. In urban areas, such as Antananarivo, the surveillance of epidemic risk indicators is highly recommended for the implementation of preventive vector control activities.

Background
----------
Plague is a bacterial disease caused by _Yersinia pestis_, which primarily affects wild rodents. It is spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which produces the characteristic plague bubo (a swelling of the lymph node). If the bacteria reach the lungs, the patient develops pneumonia (pneumonic plague), which is then transmissible from person to person through infected droplets spread by coughing. If diagnosed early, bubonic plague can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Pneumonic plague, on the other hand, is one of the most deadly infectious diseases; patients can die 24 hours after infection. The mortality rate depends on how soon treatment is started, but is always very high.

The current outbreak follows another plague outbreak that occurred in Madagascar between 2014 and 2015, with a peak in November 2014 when over 335 cases and 79 deaths were reported.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, which in Madagascar is carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages.

The following paragraph of this posting is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627662/pdf/9452403.pdf:

Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) [pop. 22.92 million, 2013] has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med 1997; 337(10): 677-80; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear if this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread.

Moramanga (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moramanga) is a city in Madagascar between the capital city Antananarivo and the east coast. The name Mora-manga literally means "easy to beautify". The city of Moramanga has an important place in the history of Madagascar. It was in Moramanga, on the night of 29 Mar 1947 that the Malagasy Uprising against French colonial rule started. Moramanga is also the capital city of the Bezanozano people (one of the 18 Ethnic groups of Madagascar). Moramanga is in the Alaotra-Mangoro region.
