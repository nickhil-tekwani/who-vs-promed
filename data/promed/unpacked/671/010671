Introduction
------------
A novel rabies virus was identified after death in a man who had immigrated
from Oaxaca, Mexico, to California, USA. [This case was described in
ProMED-mail post Rabies, human - USA (CA) ex Mexico; Archive number
20080324.1112.] Despite the patient's history of exposure to domestic and
wild carnivores, molecular and phylogenetic characterizations suggested
that the virus originated from insectivorous bats. Enhanced surveillance is
needed to elucidate likely reservoirs.

Conclusions
-----------
In 2008, a Mexican immigrant with a history of fox bite died in California
of infection with a rabies virus variant most closely associated with
rabies viruses associated with insectivorous bats (_Tadarida brasiliensis_).

Both the molecular and phylogenetic characterizations of this rabies virus
suggest that this is a new lineage. Although the primary reservoir or most
likely origin of this rabies virus was determined to be an insectivorous
bat (unknown species), the history of carnivore exposure suggests that a
secondary transmitter (vector) could have been involved in the transmission
chain, as has been reported in other cases. One cannot, however, rule out
the possibility that the unknown reservoir species of this new rabies virus
lineage is, in fact, a different bat species (which could have been
involved in the primary transmission after an unnoticed or cryptic
exposure) or a terrestrial carnivore (e.g., the biting fox).

The establishment of an insectivorous bat-derived rabies virus variant in a
terrestrial reservoir (i.e., striped skunk) in northern Arizona has been
described. Enhanced epidemiologic surveillance and intensified research to
characterize rabies virus variants and their reservoirs in the region are
needed to resolve this intriguing discovery.

as is known, all rabies virus variants so far encountered can be controlled
by "classical" rabies virus vaccine administered pre- or post-exposure. -
