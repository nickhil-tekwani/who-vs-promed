Dozens of cases of illness, fatigue and intestinal infections arrived at Daraa Governmental Hospital and the Red Crescent during the past few days, most of them residents of the Al-Sabil neighborhood, and the affected included entire families and their ages vary between 7 and 45 years.

Media sources quoted the official of the medical point in the Red Crescent, Sana Abu Saifan, as saying that the total number of cases amounted to 90, noting that "the data shared by them is that the cases that recover are due to infection again, and there are cases from non-Al-Sabil neighborhood and are visiting the neighborhood. The cases are treated for the first 3 days intravenously with flagellin [metronidazole?] and spasma [an anti-inflammatory?], bowel cleansing and anti-emetics.

The director of the Water Corporation in Daraa, Muhammad Al-Masalma, spoke of complaints received from some residents about the mixing of sewage water with drinking water, so that water samples were taken and indicated that "there are mixtures in some buildings in the Corniche Al-Sabil area in the Al-Shuhada Buildings area." He added that "the source of pollution is an old sewage line that has several blockages, and immediate measures were taken, represented by cutting off the main water line feeding the neighborhood and working to provide citizens with water through the establishment's tanks. Water sterilization pills were also distributed to be placed in water tanks pending the treatment of a problem."

The people of Daraa feared that the scope of pollution would expand from Al-Sabil neighborhood and move to the rest of the neighborhoods if the main source of pollution was not addressed quickly, and this was confirmed by the head of Daraa City Council, Amin Al-Omari, about the discovery of a sewage leak point in the expansion area west of Panorama near Hara.
