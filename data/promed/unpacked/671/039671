A national news story that a virus is attacking vineyards, with Gisborne
and Hawke's Bay hardest hit, is sensationalist and not a correct picture,
says Gisborne's wine industry.
However, the virus is a huge headache for the multimillion- dollar wine
industry.
New Zealand Winegrowers' science and innovations manager Philip Manson said
leaf roll virus three [a.k.a.leafroll virus 3 - Mod.JAD], spread by mealy
bugs, was not a new disease but did impact hugely on vineyards.
''We are not talking about an epidemic that is spreading like wildfire
through the district. It's a disease that we are well aware of and need to
manage. What we are seeing is rates of spread in New Zealand that we have
not seen in other countries."
It was a disease that needed to be watched, particularly in the Gisborne
and northern growing areas where the warmer weather allowed the vector
mealy bug to survive and move the virus from vine to vine, he said.
The nursery industry was working hard to make sure high-quality virus-free
vines were coming through and it was up to growers to make sure they pulled
out affected vines and managed the mealy bug.
The Dominion newspaper reported this morning that growers were being forced
to pull out whole vineyards. No one in the industry is aware of any
vineyards in this region being pulled out for this reason.
Pernod Ricard's Gisborne vineyard manager Warwick Bruce said the company
had an ongoing programme to replace vines affected by the virus and advised
its growers about management of the virus and bug control. About 10 to 15
hectares of the company's 380 hectares were pulled out and replaced every
year after being affected by the virus.
Riversun marketing manager Robbie Greenslade said the leaf roll virus was
not a new problem for the industry and was just a newly recognised problem
by growers.
"Leaf roll 3 is by far the most commercially-significant virus within New
Zealand and it does devastate vineyards."
Over a period of time wine quality and wine quantity was reduced. The virus
affected both reds and whites but visible signs of the virus were far more
difficult to see in the white varieties, she said.
In South African vineyards there had been an incredible spread of the virus
and people in the industry wanted to make sure that did not happen here.
[Greenslade continued,] "There is definitely an issue with the virus and
with the mealy bug, which is a vector for the virus. The whole national
vineyard needs to look at how it is managing the virus and the bug."
Riversun, a Gisborne-based leading plant provider for the industry, has
vigorously tested its source material for a number of years to ensure the
vines provided to growers are delivered free of the virus. It also offers a
testing programme, through its subsidiary Linnaeus, for vineyards all over
New Zealand.
Growers needed to check their vineyards for the virus and, if they had not
done so already, establish a programme to eradicate affected vines and
control the mealy bug, which carried the virus, she said.
When planting new material, growers should ensure plant material was
certified free from leaf roll 1 and 3.

[The crop plant grapevine, _Vitis vinifera_, develops symptoms of the
disease leafroll when infected by grapevine leafroll virus 3 (family:
Closteroviridae, genus: Closterovirus). It is transmitted by the insect
vector mealybug (_Planococcus spp_). There are several other
closteroviruses associated with leafroll and other symptoms of virus
disease in grapevine in addition to grapevine leafroll virus 3.
Leafroll of grapevines occurs worldwide in all grape-growing areas.
According to the first link listed below, Germany suffered an 80 percent
leafroll infection in 1936. In Nuriootpa, Southern Australia, natural
spreading of leafroll symptoms in Pinot noir clone material was observed.
In 1993, 6 percent of vines displayed leafroll symptoms, which escalated to
21 and 36 percent in 1994 and 1995, respectively. In France some vineyards
are reported to be 80 percent infected with leafroll.
The incidence of leafroll infection over recent years in New Zealand has
increased rapidly. The virus is now causing concern in New Zealand with
possible rapid spread on the North Island. The article chosen from several
in early June 2006 points out that the virus is not new and may simply be
catching the attention of some growers for the 1st time. Management is by
testing of existing groves for the virus, the use of clean (virus-tested)
planting stock when replanting or establishing new vineyards, and by vector
control. Despite the attempt to minimize alarm, it is clear from the
article that the presence and spread of the virus is leading to systematic
and accelerated replanting of some vineyards in New Zealand.
