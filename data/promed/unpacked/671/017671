[1] Rapid tests

The United States leads the world in COVID-19 deaths but lags behind many countries -- both large and small -- in testing capacity. That could soon change. At the end of August [2020], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency-use approval to a new credit-card-sized testing device for the coronavirus that costs USD 5, gives results in 15 minutes, and doesn't require a laboratory or a machine for processing. The United States is spending USD 760 million on 150 million of these tests from healthcare company Abbott Laboratories, headquartered in Abbott Park, Illinois, which plans to ramp up production to 50 million per month in October [2020].

The tests detect specific proteins -- known as antigens -- on the surface of the virus and can identify people who are at the peak of infection, when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. Proponents argue that this could be a game changer. Antigen tests could help to keep the pandemic at bay because they can be rolled out in vast numbers and can spot those who are at greatest risk of spreading the disease. These tests are also a key element in the testing strategies of other countries, such as India and Italy.

Antigen assays are much faster and cheaper than the gold-standard tests that detect viral RNA using a technique called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). But antigen tests aren't as sensitive as the PCR versions, which can pick up minuscule amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19.

This difference raises some concerns among specialists, who worry that antigen tests will miss infectious people and result in outbreaks in countries that have largely controlled coronavirus transmission. Others view the lower sensitivity as an attribute, because some people who receive positive PCR test results are infected, but are no longer able to spread the virus to others. So antigen tests could shift the focus to identifying the most infectious people.

At present, antigen tests are administered by trained professionals, but some companies are developing versions that are simple enough to be used at home -- similar to pregnancy tests. "Making the tests faster, cheaper, easier is definitely the goal -- and I think the antigen test is the way to get there," says Martin Burke, a chemist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who is co-developing rapid tests, including antigen-based assays. "This is by no means the perfect solution, it's just the fastest thing we could get going now," he says.

Which tests tell whether someone is infectious?
Although the PCR method can test whether someone is infectious, it also detects people who have the virus but are not likely to spread it. Antigen-based testing, by contrast, could help to rapidly identify people who have high levels of virus -- those who are most likely to be infectious to others -- and isolate them from the community, says Marion Koopmans, a virologist at the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. "The question is, what is the safe limit? Because the moment you get that wrong, the whole idea implodes," she says. It's still unclear what viral load is the threshold below which a person is no longer contagious, says Koopmans, who is working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to determine a standard to validate rapid tests. "It would be very worrying if everyone does that on their own, using different criteria," she says.

Viral load peaks early in SARS-CoV-2 infections and then gradually declines, with tiny amounts of virus RNA staying in someone's nose or throat for weeks or possibly months. And although there are not enough data to equate different viral levels with how infectious people are, there is evidence that individuals are unlikely to spread the virus about 8-10 days after showing symptoms.

The FDA, however, has authorized antigen-based tests only for people who have had symptoms for 12 days or fewer. Tests must be prescribed by a physician and administered by a health-care professional. Some researchers worry that there won't be enough antigen tests available to greatly expand their use. "Rapid tests right now are for the happy few," Koopmans says. "If we want to take these assays responsibly forward, we should talk about whether they can be produced to levels that would make them globally available."

Rapid tests on the order of pregnancy tests could be a boon to controlling the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus if everyone did it and followed through appropriately, that is, self-isolating if positive but that would be dependent on individual will. It would be no different from choosing to wear a mask to protect others in the population. For those who are concerned about not putting others at risk, the rapid test determining who is infectious would be highly valuable. It also could be valuable in situations like school environments, prisons, and nursing homes, but for individual use by the population, it is not clear how many individuals would test themselves and act upon a positive result correctly if asymptomatic, in the current environment, as least in the USA. Another concern is the loss of data in following the curve of the case counts. Individuals could be encouraged to report results to their local health departments, but that procedure would need to be worked out. There is much to be taken into consideration, but it would be helpful to have a field trial with a control and test region. - Mod.LK]

[Mod.LK is right on target with concerns re: widespread, unmonitored use of these tests. Given the experiences in the USA with the politicization of the NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions such as wearing masks in public venues, maintaining social distancing of 2 meters) the concerns re: individuals self-isolating without being under guidance if found to have high antigen loads is very risky, to say the least. That being said, the use of these tests in many of the institutional settings has potential high merit to avoid the outbreaks that have been associated with these settings. The use with professional caretakers for high risk populations is also a potential benefit, permitting screening on a daily basis at a relatively low cost, and reducing the risk of introducing the virus into those settings. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Europe: COVID-19 surge
Date: Thu 17 Sep 2020 16.09 BST
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/17/covid-in-europe-who-warns-of-alarming-spread-across-continent


The World Health Organization has warned of "alarming" transmission rates of COVID-19 in Europe, saying weekly reported cases were now higher than during the pandemic's peak, and "a very serious situation" was unfolding across the continent.

As France's health minister warned of a "worrying rise" in intensive care admissions in some parts of the country and authorities from Madrid to Dublin weighed their next steps, the WHO's regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, said last week's 7-day tally of new cases on the continent was 305 054, against 264 675 in the week of [30 Mar 2020].

More than half of European countries had reported increases of 10 percentage points or more during the past fortnight, Kluge said on Thursday [17 Sep 2020] -- while in 7, new infections had more than doubled over the same 14-day period.

"In the spring and early summer [2020], we saw the impact of strict lockdown measures," he said. "Our efforts, our sacrifices, paid off. In June [2020], cases hit an all-time low. These September [2020] case numbers should serve as a wake-up call for all of us." While the surge in infections partly reflected more comprehensive testing, he said, it also showed "alarming rates of transmission across the region", particularly among 25 to 49-year-olds, who make up the largest proportion of new cases. The continent had so far lost 226 524 lives to COVID-19, Kluge said, with a "monumental impact on mental health, economies, livelihoods, and society." Fatigue was setting in and needed "to be understood and addressed where it puts us at risk."

Reinforcing the WHO's concerns, the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) said the 14-day case notification rate for the region had risen for more than 50 days and its projections showed "potential for a larger upsurge of cases" later in the year [2020]. The EU agency said more testing was "not the only reason for the increase," which it blamed on "the relaxation of hygiene and physical distancing measures," saying the rise was a powerful reminder that "the pandemic is not over." The ECDC said recent evidence from scientific research had confirmed that physical distancing of 1 metre [3 ft] or more "ensures a 5-fold reduction in the transmission risk, with every extra metre of distance giving twice the protective effect."

Governments around Europe are urgently considering reintroducing tougher measures in an attempt to slow the virus's renewed rapid spread, and several have already done so.

In France, which this week introduced new rules in Marseille and Bordeaux including limiting gatherings to 10, outlawing standing at bars, and banning drinking on the street, health minister Olivier Veran demanded regional prefects in Lyon and Nice present plans for new distancing laws to the government by the weekend [19-20 Sep 2020]. "The epidemic is once more very active in the country," Veran said, adding that 5 in every 100 tests were now positive compared with 1 in every 100 at the start of the summer and ICU admissions in some parts of the country were a concern. Gatherings of friends and family were a "major source of infections", he said, and hygiene and physical distancing measures "must be observed more than ever." However, according to Le Monde, President Emmanuel Macron is reluctant to take more drastic steps, having decided the country must learn to "live with the virus" -- while protecting its most vulnerable -- unless the surge in cases is mirrored by a parallel surge in hospital and intensive care admissions, which is not yet the case nationally. "He considers France is in a position to control the virus for the moment," an adviser told the newspaper, denying the government was now pursuing a strategy aimed at achieving herd immunity. "We are at the point we were in February [2020]."

In Spain, where the 14-day cumulative total of cases per 100 000 people stands at 287, the highest in Europe, the health minister, Salvador Illa, on Thursday [17 Sep 2020] called on the Madrid regional government "to do whatever needs to be done". Spain had logged a total of 614 360 COVID-19 cases by Wednesday [16 Sep 2020], up almost 11 200 on the previous day. Over the past fortnight, 120 657 new infections have been diagnosed, 1/3 of them in the capital and its region, while 366 people have died across Spain from COVID-19 in the past 7 days, 124 of them in Madrid. The regional government of the Madrid president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, which said it was looking at bringing in lockdowns of specific areas and limits on movement this weekend [19-20 Sep 2020], has been criticised for its slow reaction to re-emergence of the virus. On Thursday [17 Sep 2020] it appeared to perform a U-turn, saying the word "lockdown" made people nervous and it needed to send "a message of calm." Spanish media said the regional government was planning to reopen the enormous field hospital set up at the height of the previous peak in Madrid's main conference centre.

In Austria, the chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said private indoor gatherings would be limited to 10 people from Monday [21 Sep 2020], orders at bars and restaurants would be limited to customers who were seated and face masks would be required at markets, in churches and while moving around restaurants.

Fears of a new lockdown mounted in Athens, with the number of fatalities in Greece rising to 322 on Thursday [17 Sep 2020] and 2/3 of intensive care beds in the greater Athens region of Attica, home to more than half of the country's population, now full. "If this situation continues, especially in Attica, we will undoubtedly have a lockdown, there is no doubt about it," Nikolaos Sypsas, an infectious disease expert and a member of the scientific committee advising the government, said on Thursday [17 Sep 2020].

The Irish government has signalled it could tighten restrictions on Dublin this weekend [19-20 Sep 2020], including limiting restaurants to take-outs.

The ECDC said in a technical update on Thursday [17 Sep 2020] that not all countries that had recorded an increased number of confirmed cases in August and September [2020] had also observed "an associated increase in rates of hospitalisation or mortality." The agency said its projections showed "potential for a larger upsurge of cases later in the year [2020]" in countries that had lifted most restrictions, and also more cases in countries that have rapidly increased testing. In some of these countries, this would be accompanied by "increased hospital use and deaths as a result of higher rates of community transmission," the ECDC said. Those that had kept measures more constant over time might expect to see hospitalisation rates and deaths remain "broadly consistent", it said.

[The Guardian article above has some interesting tables and graphs worth looking at. While the hospitalization rates are not following the increased trends for confirmed cases, observations over the course of the past few months in the countries with resurgences, there was a greater time lag between the increased cases and the mortality, with increases in mortality starting to rise beginning approximately 6 weeks following the noted increase in confirmed cases. If you look closely at the country graphs, at about 6 weeks following the onset of increased cases, there is the beginning of an increase in hospitalizations. One of the explanations has been the lower average age of cases in the more recent surges, with affected age groups predominantly in the less than 40-year-old group, an age group with a lower incidence of co-morbidities and lower incidence of severe disease. The increase was somewhat expected as the summer vacations began and NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions) were relaxed by the population.

[3] China: eyeglasses and COVID-19 cases
Date: Wed 16 Sep 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/well/live/does-wearing-glasses-protect-you-from-coronavirus.html


When researchers in China were analyzing hospital data of patients with COVID-19, they noticed an odd trend: very few of the sick patients regularly wore glasses. In one hospital in Suizhou, China, 276 patients were admitted over a 47 day period, but only 16 patients -- less than 6 percent -- had myopia or nearsightedness that required them to wear glasses for more than 8 hours a day. By comparison, more than 30 percent of similarly aged people in the region needed glasses for nearsightedness, earlier research had shown.

Given that the rate of nearsightedness appeared to be so much higher in the general population than in the COVID-19 ward, the scientists wondered: Could wearing glasses protect a person from becoming infected with coronavirus? "Wearing of eyeglasses is common among Chinese individuals of all ages," wrote the study authors. "However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan in December 2019, we observed that few patients with eyeglasses were admitted in the hospital ward." The observation "could be preliminary evidence that daily wearers of eyeglasses are less susceptible to COVID-19," the authors speculated.

Experts say it's too soon to draw conclusions from the research -- or recommend that people start wearing eye protection in addition to masks in hopes of lowering their risk for infection. It may be that eyeglasses act as a partial barrier, protecting eyes from the splatter of a cough or sneeze. Another explanation for the finding could be that people who wear glasses are less likely to rub their eyes with contaminated hands. A 2015 report on face touching found that over the course of an hour, students watching a lecture touched their eyes, nose, or mouth, on average, about 10 times, though the researchers did not look into whether wearing glasses made a difference.

The current study, published in JAMA Ophthalmology [see reference below], was accompanied by a commentary from Dr Lisa Maragakis, an infectious disease specialist and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who urged caution in interpreting the results. The study was small, involving fewer than 300 cases of COVID-19, a tiny fraction of the nearly 30 million reported cases of coronavirus infection around the world. Another concern is that the data on nearsightedness in the comparison group were gleaned from a study that took place decades earlier.

And Dr Maragakis noted that any number of factors could confound the data, and it may be that wearing glasses is simply associated with another variable that affects risk for COVID-19. For example, it could be that people who wear glasses tend to be older, and more careful and more likely to stay home during a viral outbreak, than those who do not wear glasses. Or perhaps people who can afford glasses are less likely to contract the virus for other reasons, like having the means to live in less crowded spaces.

"It's one study," Dr Maragakis said. "It does have some biological plausibility, given that in health care facilities, we use eye protection," such as face shields or goggles. "But what remains to be investigated is whether eye protection in a public setting would add any protection over and above masks and physical distancing. I think it's still unclear."

Healthcare workers wear protective equipment over their eyes to protect them from droplets that can fly from coughs and sneezes, as well as aerosolized particles that form when patients undergo medical procedures, such as intubation. But for the vast majority of people, that extra level of protection probably isn't needed if a person is wearing a mask and keeping physical distance in public spaces. There's also the possibility of introducing risk by wearing glasses -- some people might touch their faces more when they put on glasses, rather than less, noted Dr Maragakis.

That said, more study is needed to see if the trend holds up in other study populations, said Dr Thomas Steinemann, a spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and professor of ophthalmology at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. "I think it's provocative, and it's extremely interesting," Dr Steinemann said.

But Dr Steinemann noted that the study shouldn't cause worry among people who don't wear glasses. "It probably can't hurt to wear glasses, but does everybody need to do that? Probably not," he said. "I think you have to consider the practicality of wearing eye protection or a face shield. People in certain occupations, first responders, caregivers for someone who is ill, those are people who should maybe take special notice."

The findings also raise interesting questions about how often the eyes might be the entry portal for the virus. It's long been established that viruses and other germs can enter the body through facial mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, and mouth. But the nose seems to be a main entry point for coronavirus because it has a high number of receptors that create a friendly environment in which the virus can replicate and move down the respiratory tract.

But doctors are seeing a small percentage of patients with eye symptoms, including conjunctivitis or pink eye, which suggests the virus may also be entering the body through the eyes. Although eye symptoms are less common than other symptoms like cough or fever, various studies have reported that eye complaints can be a sign of COVID-19 infection. Last month [August 2020], researchers reported a study of 216 children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan. Among those patients, 49 children, or nearly 23 percent of the cases, had eye symptoms, including conjunctival discharge, eye rubbing, and conjunctival congestion. In addition to pink eye, itchy eyes, excessive tearing, blurred vision, and feeling like something is in the eye have all been described by patients with COVID-19.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Key points
-----------
"Question. What is the association between the daily wear of eyeglasses and susceptibility to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

"Findings. In this cohort of 276 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Suizhou, China, the proportion of daily wearers of eyeglasses was lower than that of the local population (5.8% vs 31.5%).

"Meaning. These findings suggest that daily wearers of eyeglasses may be less likely to be infected with COVID-19.

"Abstract
---------
"Importance. The proportion of daily wearers of eyeglasses among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is small, and the association between daily wear of eyeglasses and COVID-19 susceptibility has not been reported.

"Objective. To study the association between the daily wearing of eyeglasses and the susceptibility to COVID-19.

"Design, setting, and participants. This cohort study enrolled all inpatients with COVID-19 in Suizhou Zengdu Hospital, Suizhou, China, a designated hospital for COVID-19 treatment in the area, from [27 Jan to 13 Mar 2020]. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the 5th edition of Chinese COVID-19 diagnostic guidelines. The proportion of persons with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province was based on data from a previous study.

"Exposures. Daily wearing of eyeglasses for more than 8 hours.

"Main outcomes and measures. The main outcomes were the proportions of daily wearers of eyeglasses among patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and among the local population. Data on exposure history, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases, duration of wearing glasses, and myopia status and the proportion of people with myopia who wore eyeglasses in Hubei province were collected. People who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day were defined as long-term wearers.

Results. A total of 276 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Of these, 155 (56.2%) were male, and the median age was 51 (interquartile range, 41-58) years. All those who wore glasses for more than 8 hours a day had myopia and included 16 of 276 patients (5.8%; 95% CI, 3.04%-8.55%). The proportion of people with myopia in Hubei province, based on a previous study, was 31.5%, which was much higher than the proportion of patients with COVID-19 who had myopia in this sample.

"Conclusions and relevance. In this cohort study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Suizhou, China, the proportion of inpatients with COVID-19 who wore glasses for extended daily periods (longer than 8 h/d) was smaller than that in the general population, suggesting that daily wearers of eyeglasses may be less susceptible to COVID-19."

A very provocative theory being raised here. Yes, the sample population is small and this is an observational study... but it warrants further investigation. Eyeglasses may well be another easy NPI to reduce the risk of transmission, the equivalent of easily available "everyman/woman goggles." - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (96 793), followed by the USA (46 295) and Brazil (35 757) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 57.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 5378 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (16-17 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (12 701), Spain (11 291), France (10 593), Colombia (7568), and Russia (5762), and 32 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 5.5%.
