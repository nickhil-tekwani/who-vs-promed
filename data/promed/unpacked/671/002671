Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Big Pine Key, Big Pine Kay, Florida
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Jul 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Key deer: _Odocoileus virginianus clavium_ (Cervidae)/ - / 1 / - / - / 0
Affected population: Key deer from a wildlife refuge in Big Pine Key, Florida. All of the potentially affected animals are from the same Key, Big Pine Key.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Animal health and wildlife officials from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the State of Florida are investigating and responding to a confirmed detection of New World screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) in a wild deer from a wildlife refuge in one of Florida's keys known as Big Pine Key. Big Pine Key, is part of the Florida Keys which are a coral cay archipelago (group of islands) located off the southern coast of Florida. This is the first local detection of New World screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) in the United States in more than 30 years. Response activities include fly trapping, sterile fly release to prevent reproduction, and enhanced surveillance to look for additional cases. The goal is to limit the infestation from spreading to any new area and eradicate the New World screwworm flies from the affected Key. There have been no human or livestock cases. Big Pine Key, Florida is located a large distance away from any livestock areas.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; control of vectors; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (wound treatment and killing of larvae)
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results

[The New World Screwworm (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_, Diptera: Caliphoridae) is a neotropical parasite that affects wildlife, livestock, and occasionally humans. Starting in 1957 in Florida, an eradication program was begun using the 'sterile insect technique', culminating in the eradication of the fly in North America to the Darian Gap in south Panama where a containment effort is ongoing. This finding is bad news and an immediate response is required. - Mod.PMB]
