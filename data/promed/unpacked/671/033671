Northern provinces contain PRRS-infected pigs
---------------
The Porcine Reproductive & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) has attacked
pigs in 4 northern provinces of Hai Duong, Bac Ninh, Bac Giang and
Thai Binh, said an official of the Veterinary Department.
PRRS disease has just appeared in 4 provinces, not 9 as previously
reported, said Hoang Van Nam, Deputy Director of the Veterinary
Department under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development at
a meeting of the National steering board for bird flu control on [17
Apr 2007]. Pigs with PRRS in Hanoi, Thanh Hoa, Son La and Bac Kan
provinces are transported from the 4 above provinces and they are
culled all. Mr. Nam said that as the disease occurred in small areas,
farmers and local veterinary agencies didn't pay much attention
resulted in the spreading of this disease.
To prevent and control a PRRS epidemic in the above provinces, local
veterinary agencies have decontaminated and instructed farmers to use
anti-epidemic measures. PRRS is listed among dangerous contagious
diseases in the world. It appeared for the 1st time in 1987. This
disease was reported in Vietnam in 1997.
