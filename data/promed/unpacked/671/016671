California: Human and Animal Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
California's 1st probable case of locally acquired West Nile virus
infection in 2003 has turned up in a Riverside County man who might have
been infected while working near the Santa Ana River, health officials said
on Thu 9 Oct 2003. Birds infected with West Nile virus have been found in
Temecula, Sun City, and Rialto, the first discovered in San Bernardino County.
The discovery of the mosquito-borne virus in humans was not unexpected.
West Nile virus had been found previously in birds and mosquitoes in the
Coachella Valley, the city of Riverside and in Los Angeles County. State
health officials said they had expected someone would fall ill from the
virus next year, if not this fall. The 32-year-old Moreno Valley
construction worker developed viral meningitis at the end of September,
said Riverside County Health Director Dr. Gary Feldman. Preliminary tests
later indicated that the meningitis resulted from West Nile virus
infection. The state Department of Health Services is performing additional
tests to confirm the finding. Riverside County health officials also are
checking on a co-worker of the infected man who fell ill about the same
time but did not seek care, Feldman said. It is possible other people
already have been infected but might not have gotten sick enough to notice,
Feldman said.
West Nile virus first appeared in North America in 1999 in New York City.
It has spread to nearly every state in the nation. California has had
several West Nile infections in people, but virtually all of them
contracted the disease while traveling in other states. One case remains a
mystery: A Los Angeles County woman developed West Nile virus infection
during 2002 and said she had not been out of the state. State health
officials are baffled how she could have fallen ill when no other infected
humans, animals or insects in the state had been found [at that time].
Health officials believe that the woman could have been infected by a
mosquito that hitchhiked in an airplane or other vehicle, or that West Nile
virus reached California last year but wasn't detected until this summer,
said Vicki Kramer, chief of the state's vector-borne disease section.
Mosquitoes collected in the Imperial Valley in mid-July recently tested
positive for West Nile, the earliest detection in California, Kramer said.
Test results released on Thu 9 Oct 2003 confirmed that a blackbird in Sun
City and crows collected in Temecula and Rialto have the virus, said Ken
Linthicum, a supervising biologist with the state health department. San
Bernardino County vector control workers will knock on doors today to check
for mosquito-breeding pools within a mile of where the infected bird was
found, said Dr. Thomas Prendergast, the county's health director. 5 dead
birds, mostly crows, found in Riverside near the same location as an
infected sparrow are being analyzed at a San Bernardino laboratory, said
Jared Dever, spokesman with the Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control
District. Results should be available next week, he said. Cooling weather
may soon bring an end to the mosquito season in western Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, both Feldman and Prendergast noted.

Michigan: 2 Cases of Infection Detected through Blood donations
---------------------------------------------------
2 new cases of the West Nile virus infection in humans have been identified
in Michigan, bringing the state's total number in 2003 to 3, state health
officials said on Mon 13 Oct 2003. The disease was found in 2 Wayne County
women through blood donations, the Michigan Department of Community Health
officials said. The donations never entered the state's general supply, the
department said, and the women, ages 30 and 50, have recovered. The women
gave blood in mid-September and developed West Nile symptoms shortly
thereafter, Health Department spokesman T.J. Bucholz said.
The Red Cross tests donations for the virus, he said. The first human case
this year was found in a 90-year-old Berkley woman, who died on 4 Sep 2003.
She had been admitted to an Oakland County hospital on 17 Aug 2003.
West Nile can be transmitted from infected birds to humans by mosquitoes.
Most people infected either have no flu-like symptoms or develop only mild
ones. Cool weather in the state has helped reduce the number of mosquitoes
this year, and the infection rate has been much lower. Experts said the
virus appears to be moving west. In 2002, Michigan had the nation's
2nd-highest number of West Nile virus, cases in humans: 644 cases,
including 51 deaths, [whereas as of Wed 15 Oct 2003 the number of cases and
deaths confirmed by CDC-ArboNET in 2003 are 4 and 2 respectively. - Mod.CP].
As of 10 Oct 2003, there have been 6657 human cases of West Nile and 139
deaths in the United States reported to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention this year. Many of the cases are west of the
Mississippi River, in Colorado, South Dakota, and Nebraska.

Indiana: 2nd Death from West Nile Virus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A 2nd Hoosier apparently has died of West Nile virus infection this year,
and the number of cases in the state has jumped by 13 [listed as probable
cases] to a total of 30, state health officials reported on Fri 10 Oct 2003.
Although the new cases announced on Friday mark a significant increase in
this year's total of West Nile cases in Indiana, the number of cases still
lags significantly behind 2002, when there were 293 cases in the state.
State health officials counted 11 deaths last year, including 2 in Marion
County, but county health officials believe a 3rd death was the result of a
West Nile virus infection.
The death announced on Friday involved a person in Lake County, according
to the Indiana State Department of Health. This year's 1st suspected West
Nile virus death, reported in September, involved a person in Allen County.
This year's Indiana cases have involved people ranging in age from younger
than 1 to 85 years.

Arizona: Pigeons Test West Nile Virus-positive in Pima County
--------------------------------------------------
County and state officials have identified the 1st equine case of West Nile
virus in Pima County. The 11-year-old thoroughbred was euthanized 26 Sep
2003, the day it developed symptoms, according to a news release from the
Pima County Health Department.
The Health Department and the Arizona Department of Agriculture, which
confirmed the case yesterday, are testing 7 other horses for the
virus. The infected horse was stabled in the same area where 2 pigeons
tested positive for the illness, the news release said. The pigeons died 29
Sep 2003. That same week, the county reported its 1st case in a bird, a crow.

[As of Wed 15 Oct 2003, in the USA, only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska,
Nevada, and Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus
infection of any animal species (apart from travel-related human cases)
since the appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past few weeks have been
414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, 646, and now 450; it is clear that the outbreak
is beginning to wane. The 3 western/midwestern states of Colorado,
Nebraska, and South Dakota have accounted for 60.5 percent (4208/6957) of
the total number of confirmed human cases and 45 percent of fatalities in
2003. - Mod.CP]
