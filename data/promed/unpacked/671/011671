Multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Adelaide infections linked to pre-cut melon
-----------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health, and regulatory officials in several states, and the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Adelaide infections. Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of 7 Jun 2018, 60 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Adelaide have been reported from 5 states.

State / Case count
Illinois / 6
Indiana / 11
Michigan / 32
Missouri / 10
Ohio / 1
Total / 60

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 30 Apr 2018, to 28 May 2018. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 97, with a median age of 67. 65 per cent are female. Out of 47 people with information available, 31 (66 per cent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses that [have] occurred after 20 May 2018, might not yet have been reported as it takes an average of 2 to 4 weeks between a person becoming ill and the illness being reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and preliminary traceback evidence indicates that pre-cut melon supplied by the Caito Foods, LLC of Indianapolis, Indiana is a likely source of this multistate outbreak. In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. 25 (64 per cent) of 39 people interviewed reported eating pre-cut melon purchased from grocery stores, including cantaloupe, watermelon, or a fruit salad mix with melon. An additional 7 people reported consuming melons but did not specify if it was pre-cut.

Information collected from stores where ill people shopped indicates that Caito Foods, LLC supplied pre-cut melon to these stores. On 8 Jun 2018, Caito Foods, LLC recalled fresh cut watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and fresh-cut fruit medley products containing one of these melons produced at the Caito Foods facility in Indianapolis, Indiana.

CDC will provide updates when more information is available

[It seems as if different types of melons are involved in this outbreak. Many of the outbreaks associated with melons that grow on the ground, such as watermelon and cantaloupe, are related to contamination of the rind while growing and subsequent contamination of the edible part by cutting through the rind. That the same strain of _S._ Adelaide has been linked to different melons suggests, unless the melons were initially contaminated by the same source of soiled irrigation water, that transfer of the pathogen to the edible part of the melon occurred after harvesting. - Mod.LL
