Since 2010, a new emerging citrus decline disease has been observed in Iran. This disease is currently widespread in the Southern part of Kerman province where it is causing the death of approximately 10 per cent of cultivated citrus trees. The disease has been observed on sweet orange (_Citrus sinensis_), grapefruit (_C. paradisi_), and mandarin (_C. reticulata_) plants grafted on Bakraee, a local citrus variety frequently used as a rootstock. Early symptoms include pale green leaves, no production of new sprouts, and general retardation of growth. Late symptoms include tree decline along with reduction and decay of the root system.

To determine the possible causes of this new decline disease, leaf and root samples were collected in March 2017 in Southern Kerman, from 9 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic citrus trees. Molecular tests revealed the presence of mixed infections with phytoplasmas and liberibacter species in symptomatic samples. Liberibacter species were identified exclusively in roots, while phytoplasmas were found in both roots and leaves. Further tests showed that liberibacter strains could be attributed to '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus' (EPPO A1 List) and that phytoplasma strains could be attributed to '_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma aurantifolia'. Further investigations are needed to better understand the etiology and epidemiology of this new citrus decline, as well as to determine its potential impact on citrus production.

[_Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas) causes Asian greening (huanglongbing, HLB), one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. Symptoms include leaf mottling, misshapen fruits, stunting and eventual death of trees. It is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), as well as by grafting, with plant material and possibly by seed. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum and vector control.

_Ca._ Phytoplasma aurantifolia (16SrII taxonomic group) causes witches' broom disease of lime (WBDL). WBDL is a devastating disease and has so far been reported from Oman (with over 98 per cent of lime trees infected), Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan and India. Symptoms may include abnormal chlorotic shoot proliferations, followed by dieback of affected branches and eventual death of the tree within a few years. The pathogen is transmitted by grafting, but an insect vector is also suspected. Disease management of phytoplasmas is difficult and generally includes vector control, removal of sources of inoculum and use of certified clean planting material.

(For more information on both diseases see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives and links below.)

Coinfections of other phytoplasmas with CaLas have been reported previously (examples via the links below). The report above is the first time this particular combination has been identified. In total, 3 liberibacter (CaLas as well as the related _Ca._ L. americanus and africanus) and at least 3 phytoplasma (including SrII, SrIX, SrI) species have been reported to cause similar symptoms in citrus. Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.
