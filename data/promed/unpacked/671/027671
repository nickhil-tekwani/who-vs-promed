SERIDA (Regional Service for Agri-Food Research and Development) has issued
an alert for halo blight of beans. The bacterial disease has been emerging
rapidly in recent years, and in Asturias it affects especially farm-grown
broad beans. The disease is most common in western regions where the
largest areas of broad beans are cultivated.

The main route of spread is considered to be contaminated seed. In a field,
one infected seed can cause a serious outbreak since the disease is spread
quickly by splashing rain or by irrigation.

[Halo blight (or grease spot) of beans is caused by the bacterium
_Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _phaseolicola_. It affects a range of legumes,
including species of _Phaseolus_ (common, French, runner, Lima beans),
_Vigna_ (cowpea, mung bean), peas, and soybean. While broad bean (_Vicia
faba_; also called faba bean, horse bean, Windsor bean, field bean, winter
bean) is not listed as a common host, according to the original news
release by SERIDA (see link below) this is the pathogen referred to above.
No information is provided whether there may be a distinct strain affecting
broad beans.

Symptoms of halo blight may include water soaked leaf spots which develop
into brown necrotic spots with a yellow halo, water soaked ("greasy") and
later necrotic spots on pods, defoliation, and stem cankers which may kill
the plant. Seeds may be shrivelled, but heavily contaminated seeds may also
appear healthy. The disease is favoured by humid conditions.

The pathogen overwinters mainly on seed, but also on undecomposed plant
debris. It is seed transmitted and also spread by water (rain, irrigation),
wind, mechanical means (including animal and human activities), plant
material and equipment. Disease management may include cultural practices,
crop rotation, phytosanitation to prevent spread, and use of certified
clean seed. Chemical control (copper compounds, antibiotics) may be
effective, but resistant strains have emerged for some of the pathovars.
Varieties with different levels of resistance are available, at least for
some of the _Phaseolus_ hosts.

Over 40 different pathovars of _P. syringae_, grouped into several races,
are known. The pathogens can affect a wide variety of plants, and new
diseases are emerging frequently. Symptoms may include leaf specks,
blights, and cankers on crops such as tomato, maize, mango, soybean,
citrus, sweet chestnut and stone fruit.
