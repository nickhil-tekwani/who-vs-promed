State wildlife officials in Fairbanks [Alaska] are warning residents to be on the lookout for sick snowshoe hares that might be carrying tularemia.

Tests confirmed that a snowshoe hare in the Fairbanks area died of tularemia last week [week of 10 Jun 2013] and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game [ADFG] has received multiple reports of sick hares, wildlife veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen said in a news release Wednesday [19 Jun 2013].

Tularemia is a bacterial disease that typically affects hares, beavers, and muskrats. Predators and scavengers, including dogs and cats, that bite into a sick or dead hare can become infected. People who handle infected hares can also contract the disease.

The disease also can be spread by ticks found on hares and water contaminated with a dead animal.

"Hares die of this infection every spring and summer in the Interior," Beckmen said.

A local resident brought a sick hare with many ticks to a Fairbanks veterinary clinic last week. Tests conducted by a diagnostic lab in Colorado confirmed the presence of the bacterium that causes tularemia. Tularemia can be fatal in humans if an infected person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics. However, human cases in Alaska are rare and only one case about every 2 years is reported. The most common symptoms in humans include skin ulcers, swollen and painful lymph glands, inflamed eyes, sore throat, mouth sores, fever, flu-like illness, diarrhea, or pneumonia.

More commonly, dogs or cats are infected with the disease after they've encountered a sick or infected hare. Pets that become infected may show fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and swollen lymph glands. Infected animals can be treated with antibiotics but it's important to do so quickly, Beckmen said, because tularemia can be contracted through the bite of an infected pet.

Beckmen encouraged anyone who sees a sick hare to contact ADFG at 459-7206 to report it. Signs that a hare is infected include lack of fear of people, lethargy, and sudden death.

People who need to touch a dead hare can protect themselves by using gloves or a plastic bag and washing their hands afterward. Dead hares should be double bagged and disposed in the trash or where pets and scavengers cannot get to them.

People are also advised not to drink untreated water from areas where there are beavers and muskrats.

[The causative bacterium, _Francisella tularensis_ , is a non sporulating, Gram negative coccobacillus that is antigenically related to _Brucella_ spp. It is a facultative intracellular parasite that is killed rapidly by heat and proper disinfection but survives for weeks or months in a moist environment. It is fastidious in growth but can be cultured readily. There are 2 types of organisms based on their biochemistry and virulence. Type A has been found predominantly in North America and is more virulent; in people, the mortality rate may be 5-7 percent if untreated. Type B is less virulent and is most commonly isolated from aquatic animals and water-associated infections in North America and Eurasia. Both types have been isolated from arthropod vectors.

In domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (such as, cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people. Bites from cats may transmit the disease to people.

The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals including hares and rabbits, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

People may develop different clinical signs of the disease depending on how they are exposed to tularemia. Possible symptoms include skin ulcers, red and inflamed eyes, a sore throat, mouth sores, and swollen and painful lymph glands, diarrhea, and/or pneumonia. If the bacteria are inhaled, signs can include abrupt onset of headache, fever, chills, a dry cough, muscle aches, joint pain, and progressive weakness. People with pneumonia may already have difficulty breathing, which may be made worse, and can develop chest pain, bloody sputum, and respiratory failure. Tularemia can be fatal if the person is not treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia.

Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels; however, tetracycline and chloramphenicol have been associated with relapses in people. Early treatment should prevent death. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Use of a vaccine previously available for people at high risk of infection (such as, laboratory personnel) is currently under review. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
