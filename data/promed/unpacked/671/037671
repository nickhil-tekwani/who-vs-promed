Melioidosis is an often fatal infectious disease caused by the soil bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. Incidence rates are increasing in regions of Southeast Asia and northern Australia to which it is endemic, and cases are increasing from the tropics worldwide (1). Little is known about the epidemiology of melioidosis in the Indian Ocean region and Africa, where only sporadic cases are reported (2-5). We report 2 melioidosis cases in residents of the city of Mahajanga, the capital of the Mahajanga Province of Madagascar. These cases were identified within an ongoing project to document melioidosis in Madagascar conducted by the Pasteur Institute in Antananarivo. Mahajanga, a favorite tourist destination in Madagascar, is located on the country's northwestern coast on the Mozambique Channel (15 degrees 43 minutes S, 46 degrees 18 minutes E), 550 km [about 342 miles] from Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. Its population is 200 000 persons.

Case-patient 1 was a 52-year-old male rural rice farmer, who had diabetes. He was admitted to Androva University Hospital in Mahajanga in July 2012 with systemic sepsis, from which he died 3 days later despite treatment with ceftriaxone. Chest radiographs showed opacity in the lower left lung and pleural effusion. Abdominal ultrasound showed hepatomegaly and splenomegaly with small hypoechogenic lesions in the spleen consistent with abscesses. Culture media used to recover organisms from the blood were Ashdownagar supplemented with gentamicin 4 mg/L (6), chocolate agar, and blood agar incubated for 24 h at 37 degrees C after inoculation. A blood culture (Hemoline Performance Diphasique, bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) taken the day after admission was positive for _B. pseudomallei_; _B. pseudomallei_ was suspected 8 days later on the basis of a biochemical phenotype (82 percent identity) using API20NE, 1154576 (bioMerieux).

Case-patient 2 was a 45-year-old male rice, sugar cane, and tobacco farmer, who had diabetes. He was admitted to Androva University Hospital in May 2013 with a recurrent fever and a history of furunculosis for several months. A week after admission, his condition deteriorated; he had progressive sepsis and hepatic failure despite therapy with ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and gentamicin. Ultrasound of the abdomen showed hepatomegaly with a multinodular appearance and splenomegaly. 4 blood samples were cultured on different days during his illness. Gram-negative colonies showed an API20NE biochemical profile of 1156576, suggesting _B. pseudomallei_ (99 percent identity). After melioidosis was presumptively diagnosed, the patient was immediately treated with ceftazidime but he died 24 hours later, 2 weeks after admission.

DNA extracted from the presumptive _B. pseudomallei_ isolates was positive by real-time PCR (7). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed as previously described (8). MLST demonstrated 2 novel allele combinations of 4, 12, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1 for case-patient 1 and 4, 12, 34, 1, 5, 2, 1 for case-patient 2. Sequences were submitted to the MLST database (http://bpseudomallei.mlst.net) and have been assigned the sequence types (ST) 1053 and 1054, respectively.

Conclusions
-----------
The fatal outcome of these 2 case-patients reflects the reality of medical care prevailing in Madagascar and much of Africa, where hospital resources are limited and the capability for diagnosing melioidosis as part of routine laboratory practice does not exist. During 1936-2012, _B. pseudomallei_ was isolated on rare occasions from Madagascar. In 1936, the Whitmore bacillus was isolated from a submaxillary node of a slaughtered pig by G. Girard, who was working at the Pasteur Institute in Madagascar. This was the 1st time this bacterium was identified in Africa (9). In 1982, M. Galimand and A. Dodin, working in the Whitmore bacillus laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, published a review of the distribution of _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_ worldwide (10) and reported that in 1977 this bacterium was found in the soil of a zoo and pig farm in Antananarivo. In 2004, a French patient coming from Madagascar was diagnosed in La Reunion with melioidosis (11). He lived in Mahajanga city, but 25 years earlier had lived in Viet Nam, where melioidosis is endemic. In 2005, melioidosis was diagnosed in a 2nd French patient in La Reunion that was also attributed to infection in Madagascar; this person lived in Antananarivo, but disease onset occurred during a stay in Mahajanga (12). In 2013, melioidosis was diagnosed in Brussels in a 3rd French patient living in Belgium who had returned from Mahajanga (13). His history did not reveal travel to any other melioidosis-endemic areas, and his infection was likely to have been acquired in Mahajanga.

Mahajanga has a tropical savanna climate; the rainy season is mostly from December to April. The 2 cases reported here occurred at the end of the rainy season; onset of all 3 published cases in French visitors occurred during March (2004, 2005, 2013). Before the 2 cases reported here from Madagascar, the only confirmed autochthonous case of melioidosis from Africa of which we were aware was in a 16-month-old boy from a remote village in rural Malawi who sought care in March 2011 (3). That case was also able to be diagnosed because of enhanced laboratory facilities associated with research support. In Mauritius, the 1st autochthonous confirmed case of melioidosis was diagnosed in 2004 (4).

Genotyping of the 2 _B. pseudomallei_ strains reported here showed novel STs for both. Furthermore, the MLST result from the 3rd French case-patient recently reported (13) demonstrated another novel allelic profile, 4, 1, 3, 2, 5, 2, 1, which has been designated ST1043. ST1043 is a single locus variant of ST1053 from case-patient 1 and ST1054 from case-patient 2 is a single locus variant of ST319, which is represented only by a single _B. pseudomallei_ isolate cultured from the 2004 Mauritius case-patient (4). The _B. pseudomallei_ isolate cultured from the recently reported Spanish traveler to Africa was ST879 (2), which is very divergent from STs 1043, 1053, and 1054, and suggests that her infection might have been acquired in 1 of the 14 West African countries she traveled through, rather than in Madagascar, which she also visited.

Although these genotype data are consistent with the findings recently reported from Africa that suggested a possible recent ancestor for strains from Malawi and Kenya, an alternative hypothesis is that the diversity and novel STs seen in Madagascar might represent more ancient origins for _B. pseudomallei_ in Africa. Phylogeographic reconstruction of _B. pseudomallei_ genomes has supported an Australian origin for _B. pseudomallei_, with a possible single introduction event into Southeast Asia, possibly during the last ice age when low sea levels created land bridges between what are now islands in the Malay Archipelago (14). Nevertheless, studies by Pearson et al. focused on strains from Australia and Southeast Asia and included few strains from the rest of the world. Without detracting from that hypothesis of spread from Australia to Southeast Asia, we suggest that a prior hypothesis of more ancient origins of _B. pseudomallei_ (15) also could explain the novel and diverse genotypes of _B. pseudomallei_ in Africa and in the Americas (1). Ongoing whole-genome sequencing of multiple isolates from diverse locations should resolve the origins and global dispersal patterns of _B. pseudomallei_.

In summary, 2 fatal cases of melioidosis in farmers who had diabetes confirm that melioidosis is endemic in Madagascar. Difficulties with diagnosis and treatment of melioidosis in less developed countries, such as Madagascar, highlight the need for support for improved laboratory services and for further collaborative studies to elucidate the epidemiology of melioidosis in regions such as Africa where its presence is suspected but where data are very limited.

[Infection due to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ (melioidosis) is primarily endemic in focal areas of South East Asia and northern Australia. _B. pseudomallei_ is deemed to be a category B biowarfare agent. It is primarily an infection of humans with underlying diseases such as alcoholism, malnutrition, cirrhosis, and immunosuppression, but can also affect healthy individuals, as in this report. In animal models, higher inocula can cause more serious infection in immunocompetent individuals. Melioidosis is not a zoonosis per se since although animals can and are infected, transmission does not occur from animal to human, rather both are infected similarly.

Dance (1), at a time when the organism had _Pseudomonas_ as its genus, discussed the epidemiology of melioidosis outside of the classically endemic areas. The following are the sections regarding Africa and Europe with the citation numbers removed:

"Africa
-------
The possibility of the existence of melioidosis in Africa was 1st raised in 1936 by Girard, who isolated a strain of _P. pseudomallei_ from the hemorrhagic submaxillary lymph node of a pig in Madagascar.... In 1969, melioidosis was reported in a goat in Chad. Then, in 1972, Ferry isolated _P. pseudomallei_ from a number of pigs in an abattoir in Niamey, Niger. These animals had been brought from neighboring Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), and Dodin and Ferry were able to isolate the organism from soil samples taken along the route that the pigs had followed. They also demonstrated seropositivity in over 10 percent of serum samples from villagers in Upper Volta. At about this time, Frazier found serological evidence that melioidosis might exist in Uganda, while Mayer, as cited by Larionov, also reported the occurrence of human melioidosis in Uganda.... Further evidence of melioidosis in Africa was provided by Bremmelgard, et al., who reported a case of human melioidosis possibly acquired in Kenya, and by Wall, et al., in The Gambia, the latter patient originating from Sierra Leone."

"Europe
-------
The most extraordinary extension of the boundaries of melioidosis took place in France in the mid-1970s ... an epizootic of melioidosis among animals in a Paris zoo was revealed. The outbreak subsequently spread to other zoos in Paris and equestrian clubs throughout France and beyond, probably by the transport of infected animals and contaminated manure.... Possibly, infected horses from Iran imported the disease, or perhaps the index case was a panda donated to France by Mao-Tse Tung in 1973....

"The isolation of _P. pseudomallei_ from horses in Spain has also been reported, as have several possible cases of human melioidosis in Berlin in 1947."

Although risk for occupational exposure to _B. pseudomallei_ in clinical laboratories exists, laboratory-acquired infections are rare. Laboratory exposures that have resulted in the most recent cases of infection involved aerosols, alone or in combination with exposure to nonintact skin (2). In one study, 3 cases of asymptomatic seroconversion were reported among laboratorians in an area where melioidosis is endemic, making difficult a determination of whether infection resulted from occupational or environmental exposure (3). CDC recommends that clinical specimens suspected of containing _B. pseudomallei_ be manipulated using biosafety level (BSL)-2 containment practices, equipment, and facilities (4). Sniffing culture plates is an unsafe laboratory procedure and should be prohibited. Manipulations of an isolate that might result in aerosol or droplet exposure or contact with nonintact skin should be conducted using BSL-3 containment practices, equipment, and facilities. In addition, improved communication between physicians and laboratorians might reduce the risks to laboratorians. Laboratory workers with high-risk exposures can be offered postexposure prophylaxis with doxycycline (2 mg/kg up to 100 mg orally, twice daily) or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (8 plus 40 mg/kg, up to 320 plus 1600 mg orally, twice daily) (5), but the optimum duration of treatment and its efficacy have not been defined clearly by human studies.

The readers are referred to a book chapter on melioidosis, aimed to its potential as a biowarfare agent (6).
