Secretary of state for the environment, Hilary Benn, today [1 Nov 2007]
announced that DEFRA is to issue a tender for a bluetongue vaccine bank.
DEFRA will tender for between 10 and 20 million doses, subject to an
assessment of the anticipated demand. Discussions on this are currently
under way with the industry.

No suitable vaccine is currently available for the strain of bluetongue
circulating in England (serotype 8). Several companies have vaccines in
development, however, and these are expected to be available from next
summer [2008].

In keeping with the principles set out in the Bluetongue Control Strategy,
which was developed in partnership with the farming industry, livestock
keepers will be offered the opportunity to purchase vaccine from the bank.

Hilary Benn said: "Whilst we are at the early stages of this outbreak, it
is sensible for us to plan ahead and tender for a vaccine bank, given the
potential benefits vaccination could provide in managing this disease
should it reappear next year [2008]. We hope this tendering process will
reassure the farming industry that we are committed to having a vaccine
supply ready as soon as vaccine becomes available. We will have a vaccine
bank that farmers will be able to purchase from, and I am sure the benefits
of vaccination will make real economic sense to many farmers."

Further discussions are under way with scientific experts on bluetongue,
representatives of the farming industry, and others on how a vaccination
program could work. Discussions are also continuing on possible approaches
to vaccination with the European Commission and other member states
affected by bluetongue.

As of 16:30 pm on 31 Oct 2007, there were 60 confirmed premises affected by
bluetongue.
