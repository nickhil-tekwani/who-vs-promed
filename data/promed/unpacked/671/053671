State animal health officials say 15 beef cattle have been euthanized
in southeastern Indiana after testing positive for bovine
tuberculosis.

The State Board of Animal Health said Friday [16 Sep 2011] it recently
completed its bovine tuberculosis testing campaign for all livestock
herds linked to a herd in Dearborn County, where one cow was found
during slaughter in December [2010] to have the disease. That cow was
Indiana's 1st such case of the disease in more than 3 decades.

Tuberculosis causes severe coughing, fatigue, emaciation and
debilitation in cattle.

All 15 of the cattle that tested positive for tuberculosis were
associated with the herd the infected cow came from.

47 free-ranging deer near the herd were also tested, but none tested
positive for the illness. Testing will continue during the fall deer
hunting season.

[The primary cause of tuberculosis in cattle is the bacteria
_Mycobacterium bovis_ (_M. bovis_). This bacterium is in the same
family with Johnes Disease and Leprosy. Adult cattle are usually
infected by inhaling invisible droplets containing the bacteria into
their lungs, while pre-weaned calves are more often infected by
drinking contaminated milk. The route of entry will ultimately
determine the clinical signs of the disease.

Since the bacterium is usually inhaled into the lungs in adult cows,
the most common clinical signs are related to pulmonary tuberculosis.
Once the bacteria enter the lungs, they begin to multiply and
generally spread to the lymph nodes near the lungs. At this primary
site of infection, the lesions can remain quietly inactive or develop
further depending on the ability of the cow to fight off the
infection. When the immune system of the cow is fully activated, the
infection may remain limited to the lungs and could go undetected for
the productive life of the cow. If the infection over-powers the body
defenses, the bacteria may be carried to other locations in the body
in the lymph or blood circulation. New areas of infection often occur
in the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen and the lymph nodes associated
with these organs. In cases allowed to progress over an extended
period of time, lesions may be present in the uterus or mammary
gland.

When calves are exposed to the tuberculosis bacteria in the milk, the
most common lesions are noted in the lymph nodes at the junction of
the neck and head around the throat. The main sign may be swelling of
these nodes. The primary lesions in calves, however, are most
frequently located in the lymph nodes along the intestinal tract.

Other species of _Mycobacterium_ may complicate the diagnosis of
tuberculosis in cattle caused by _M. bovis_, but cattle are resistant
to these infections, and they rarely cause infections with clinical
signs. _Mycobacterium avium_, causing infection by ingestion and
lesions in the intestinal tract of adult cows, and _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_, the main cause of human tuberculosis, are 2 of these
species. They cause the cattle to be sensitive to tuberculin testing
and give false positive reactions when tests are being conducted to
find cows with _M. bovis_ infections. These other bacteria are more
important as causes of infection in swine, sheep, goats and humans.

Live, infected cattle are diagnosed as being infected with _M. bovis_
with the tuberculin test. The appropriate tuberculin is purified
protein derivative (PPD), as it is specific and not costly to produce.
In the US, the tuberculin is injected into the caudal fold of the tail
near the tail head by a federally accredited veterinarian. A 0.1 ml
dose of PPD is injected intradermally. Infected cows will have an
allergic type reaction to the PPD at the injection site. The test is
read in 72 hours by palpating the injection site for the allergic
swelling. When sufficient swelling is found to indicate infection with
mycobacteria, follow-up testing is usually performed by state
officials to determine that the swelling is due to _M. bovis_ and not
a different type of mycobacterium.

Nationwide, there is active surveillance at slaughter plants. State
and federal meat inspectors check the lymph glands and other organs of
each cow for signs of tuberculosis. When any signs suspicious of
tuberculosis are found, tissues are collected and sent to the National
Veterinary Services Laboratories for confirmation. If bovine
tuberculosis is confirmed, trace-back studies are performed to find
the herd of origin. The most effective means of control in a
tuberculosis herd is to depopulate the entire herd and compensate the
owners. Otherwise, the herd will be quarantined and tested repeatedly
until all evidence of infection is eliminated.

As testing continues, all of Indiana is likely holding its breath.
Will they loose their tuberculosis free status? It will take more
cases than this, which seem to all be linked to the index cow. Loss of
the state's standing would be a blow to the producers, as it costs
extra for testing prior to sale or shipment.

The state and federal veterinary forces in Indiana will be busy doing
their testing of all animals moving into or out of this herd as well
as continuing to test neighboring herds. This press release indicates
they will be testing hunter-killed deer as well.

Tuberculosis is a slow, insidious disease that can lurk for quite a
while before rearing its head. Unfortunately, the best tests, as noted
above, do not always detect this disease in its earliest stages.

Science has been hard at work trying to develop a better test for this
disease but has not yet succeeded.
