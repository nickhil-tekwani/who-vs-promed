The Health Directorate General (DGS) of Portugal announced on [Mon 6 Nov 2017], the deaths of 2 people following a [legionellosis] outbreak in Lisbon.

The outbreak occurred at Sao Francisco Xavier Hospital, and caused the death of a 77-year-old man and a 70-year-old woman. 26 other people were diagnosed with the same infection.

The outbreak that broke out at Sao Francisco Xavier Hospital was detected on [31 Oct 2017]. It was determined to have originated in the facility's water distribution system, which has since been subjected to chemical and thermal treatments to remove the bacteria [_Legionella_].

The Portuguese government said the situation was under control, but refused to rule out the possibility of other cases. Because of the incubation time of the bacteria, some infections may indeed be delayed.

In 2014, a [legionellosis] outbreak in Vila Franca de Xira, east of Lisbon, infected 375 people and killed 12 of them.

[The news report above updates the prior ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis - Portugal: (LI) nosocomial, RFI 20171107.5428417) by reporting 2 of the 28 cases were fatal and that the hospital's water distribution system, the suspected source, has been remediated to remove _Legionella_.

We are not told what _Legionella_ species was isolated from the cases, whether the genotypes of the clinical isolates matched each other, which would establish a common source outbreak, or whether the species and genotype of the isolate from the suspected environmental source matched the genotype of the clinical isolates, which would establish the transmission pathway. More information in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
