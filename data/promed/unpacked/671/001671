A Queensland, Australia, shrimp farm has been ordered to place movement controls on its shrimp after test results confirmed a case of white spot disease (WSD).

The order came in from the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Jim Thompson, chief biosecurity officer of Biosecurity Queensland, said samples from the farm were sent to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong and he had received confirmation of positive results for WSD.

"WSD is a viral infection that affects all crustaceans," said Thompson. "Australia is considered free of the virus and this is the 1st confirmed case we've had in an aquaculture setting."

"Infected prawns [shrimp] do not pose any human health risk, and there is no suggestion that any product currently on the market is in any way affected." "Industry has been notified and Biosecurity Queensland is on site working closely with the farm operators to ensure the necessary biosecurity processes are followed, including completely destocking the site."

In addition, all movement of water from the farm has been stopped while the affected ponds are treated to minimize any risk of spread, he said.

"As part of our ongoing investigation into the possible source of the infection, we are conducting surveillance on other similar operations in the area." The case appears to be an isolated one, and will have no impact on the supplies of shrimp for the holiday season, he added.

Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Bill Byrne said he had authorized the response after being briefed on the test results.

Biosecurity Queensland is asking shrimp farmers to monitor their stock and report any concerns.

[The following information is quoted from the Australian Government's "National pest & disease outbreaks" website available at, http://www.outbreak.gov.au/current-responses-to-outbreaks/white-spot-disease:

"White spot disease, which is a highly contagious viral disease of prawns, has been detected on a prawn farm south of Brisbane, in South East Queensland. White spot disease is caused by a virus known as white spot syndrome virus. The disease, and the virus that causes it were both exotic to Australia, and pose a significant threat to the Australia's crustacean industries.

"The disease causes prawn mortality but does not pose a threat to human health or food safety. Prawns from this farm will not enter any domestic or international markets, nor will they be processed for human consumption.

"Officers from the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have attended the farm and put in place enhanced biosecurity measures and movement controls.

"Disease signs were first noticed by the farmer on 22 Nov 2016. Queensland's Biosecurity Sciences Laboratory detected white spot syndrome virus on [30 Nov 2016]. Samples were also sent to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, and it confirmed white spot disease on 1 December. [See ProMED-mail posting 20161202.4670306. - Mod.CRD]

"It is not yet known how the disease got onto the farm but the potential source of the disease is being investigated. At this stage there is no indication that the disease has spread beyond this particular farm.

"The national Aquatic Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases has met and agreed on response activities moving forward, with the aim of eradicating the disease from the farm. National response arrangements are in place to respond to white spot disease, including AQUAVETPLAN which sets out agreed destruction, disposal and decontamination activities.

"The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries will also conduct surveillance to determine the extent of the disease". - Mod.CRD
