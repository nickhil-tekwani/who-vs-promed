[New outbreaks in this region are not too common over the last few
years in the countries immediately surrounding Slovakia. However,
further south is a different story -- a few examples will suffice to
paint the picture. Romania had 52 new outbreaks in 2002 and Bulgaria
had 32. Serbia and Montenegro had 52 new outbreaks in 2002 and 128
in 2001. Bosnia and Herzegovina had 90 in 2002 and 52 in 2001.
Croatia, on the other hand, had one new outbreak in 2002 and none in
2001. In Slovakia itself, there were 48, and 40 new outbreaks over
the last 2 years reported to OIE.
As far as the source of the outbreak goes, many European outbreaks
have been caused by contact with wild boars, and there is some
indication of this in the report above. - Mod.PC]
