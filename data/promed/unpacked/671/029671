RE: Al Jazeera, Artemisinin resistant malaria found in Mae Sot [edited]
<http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia-pacific/2010/04/201041814045995.html>

The report of Al Jazira on the Emergence of
artemisinin resistance on the Thai Myanmar border is not factual.

In the interview I explained that we have
observed an increase in the parasite clearance
time following treatment with an artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT).

Before 2001 less than 5 percent of patients
treated with ACT remained positive after 3 days;
this proportion is now 20 percent. The day 63 PCR
adjusted parasitological efficacy of the ACT
(mefloquine plus artesunate) remains above 95
percent; (see report: Carrara VI, Zwang J, Ashley
EA, Price RN, Stepniewska K, et al. (2009)
Changes in the Treatment Responses to
Artesunate-Mefloquine on the Northwestern Border
of Thailand during 13 Years of Continuous
Deployment. PLoS ONE 4(2): e4551.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0004551)
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0004551>.

This delayed parasite clearance is much less
pronounced than that observed in Western Cambodia
and does not imply resistance to artemisinin.
Other mechanisms such as host related factors could explain the observation.
