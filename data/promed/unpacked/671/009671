Health officials in the Republic of Cyprus have confirmed that 2 human cases of avian influenza have been detected on the island for the 1st time, as bird flu sweeps through a number of countries.

According to the Veterinary Services Department of the Agriculture Ministry, 2 cases of bird flu have been detected in 2 locations in Famagusta district.

While the specific strain of influenza has been detected in birds in the past on the island, this was the 1st time humans were known to have been infected in Cyprus.

Local medical expert Petros Karayiannis said infection takes place when humans are in direct contact with contaminated birds, adding that the disease is not transferred when people consume poultry.

The 2 infection locations, described as private waterfowl collections, were immediately placed under restriction and the owners of the poultry farms were instructed to take strict biosecurity measures to prevent the virus from spreading.

An official who spoke on state radio Monday morning [28 Nov 2022] said avian influenza resembles common flu, adding people handling poultry are at a higher risk of getting infected and in some cases bird flu can be more severe for humans.

Bird flu, also called avian flu, is a strain of influenza that infects mostly wild water birds but can infect domestic birds and other animals.

Avian influenza is usually transported from one country to another through migratory birds, the press release said.

A number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan have been experiencing outbreaks recently while first human cases were reported in a number of countries over the last two years.

People do not need to worry about catching bird flu as doing so is extremely rare, a state expert said on Monday [28 Nov 2022] after 2 incidents of the disease were found at the weekend.

It is rare for humans to become infected with avian flu or to infect each other with it, and most people don't need to worry about getting sick from this particular virus, Linos Hadjihannas said, speaking to CyBC radio.

No cases in humans of avian flu have ever been reported in Cyprus, Hadjihannas added.

Infected birds have been found, he said, including recently at 2 aquatic bird collections in Famagusta.

Assistant Director of State Veterinary Services Yiannos Ioannou said that authorities were not concerned over the identification of cases of bird flu in the private bird collections in Famagusta, as these birds were not to be bought or sold. The birds will be euthanised on Tuesday [29 Nov 2022], he said.

Additionally, an epidemiological sampling will be undertaken by state services in a 3 km radius [1.86 mi] around the location where the infected birds were kept to track any spread of the disease.

All the relevant authorities have been informed and protocols are in place, Hadjihannsa said for managing cases detected in poultry farms as well as in populations of birds kept as pets.

Those handling infected birds are the ones possibly at risk of catching the virus, however, this too is rare. The illness manifests similarly to the H1N1 flu virus, and, like flu, severity of symptoms depends on the infected person's age and state of health.

Hadjihannas recommended getting vaccinated for flu as it partially protects against avian flu as well.

According to the NHS website, it is not possible to catch bird flu through eating fully cooked poultry or eggs, even in areas with an outbreak of bird flu.

[The reports above do not specify the subtype information of the 'bird flu' cases. However, what is clear is that this is the 1st time human cases of avian influenza have been identified in the country. The mode of disease transmission to the birds in the perimeter fenced farm locations that remain open from above, is possibly other endemic birds that were in the Paralimni lake region that flew over or may have entered/ transferred droppings etc. - Mod.UBA]

CHP closely monitors human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) in Mainland
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [30 Nov 2022] closely monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) in the Mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The case involves a 38-year-old woman who lived in Qinzhou, Guangxi, and who had exposure to live domestic poultry before onset. She developed symptoms on 22 Sep 2022 and was admitted for treatment on 25 Sep 2022. She passed away on 18 Oct 2022. From 2005 to date [30 Nov 2022], 54 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) have been reported by Mainland health authorities. "All novel influenza A infections, including H5N1, are notifiable infectious diseases in Hong Kong," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Travellers to the Mainland or other affected areas must avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms. They should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry when visiting relatives and friends. They should also avoid purchasing live or freshly slaughtered poultry, and avoid touching poultry/birds or their droppings. They should strictly observe personal and hand hygiene when visiting any place with live poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases. It is essential to tell the doctor if they have seen any live poultry during travel, which may imply possible exposure to contaminated environments. This will enable the doctor to assess the possibility of avian influenza and arrange necessary investigations and appropriate treatment in a timely manner.

While local surveillance, prevention and control measures are in place, the CHP will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments.

The public should maintain strict personal, hand, food and environmental hygiene and take heed of the advice below when handling poultry:
- Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings
- When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs
- Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done
- Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing
- Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

The public may visit the CHP's pages [https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/index.html] for more information: the avian influenza page, the weekly Avian Influenza Report, global statistics and affected areas of avian influenza, the Facebook Page and the YouTube Channel.

China confirms new case of human infection with bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has been recorded in China.

The Hong Kong health authorities announced this on Wednesday [30 Nov 2022], citing information received from colleagues in mainland China.

The infection was confirmed in a 38-year-old resident of the city of Qingzhou in southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. She had contact with poultry. The patient died in the hospital, reports SalamNews with reference to TASS.

Since 2005, 54 cases of human infection with the H5N1 virus strain have been reported in China.

[It must be noted that this is the 1st fatal human H5N1 case reported in 2022, anywhere in the world. The last fatal human case on ProMED was from Nepal back in 2019, and there haven't been significant numbers/deaths from human H5N1 from China since circa 2007. (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0002985)

The overall public health risk from currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface has not changed, and the likelihood of sustained human-to-human transmission of these viruses remains low. Human infections with viruses of animal origin are expected at the human-animal interface wherever these viruses circulate in animals.

All human infections caused by a new influenza subtype are required to be reported under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).

This includes any influenza A virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect a human and its haemagglutinin gene (or protein) is not a mutated form of those, i.e. A(H1) or A(H3), circulating widely in the human population. Information from these notifications is critical to inform risk assessments for influenza at the human-animal interface. - Mod.UBA
