MUMPS - CANADA (BRITISH COLUMBIA)
*********************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Mon, 17 Nov 1997 10:21:31 -0800
From: James Chin, MD, MPH, CDPC-mail and Canada Communicable Disease
Report:23(22),
November 15, 1997.

Mumps, an acute viral disease caused by mumps virus (family
_Paramyxoviridae_, genus _Rubulavirus_), is defined for surveillance
purposes as an illness characterized by fever and tender, self-limited
swelling of the salivary gland(s), lasting about 2 days without other
apparent cause.
In January and February 1997, an unexpected number of cases of mumps were
reported to the Vancouver/Richmond Health Board (V/RHB). An investigation
was initiated with the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC).
Between 1 January 1997 and 31 March 1997, a total of 83 cases of mumps were
reported via the BC Communicable Disease Surveillance System.
A universal combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) immunization program
was introduced in BC in 1981 for children aged >12 months.
Initial case follow-ups by the V/RHB suggested that public social events
were risk factors for acquiring mumps in the young adult age group. A
case-control study was initiated to examine this hypothesis and to further
explore the outcomes of mumps illness. Vaccine effectiveness, ascertained
by self-reported immunization status, was estimated to be 80% (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 29% to 96%).
Eighty-eight percent (45/51) of the cases reported being in the Greater
Vancouver area during the exposure period. Among the 47 matched
case-control pairs, contact with a person with mumps was significantly
associated with illness (odds ratio = 13, 95% CI = 1.95 to 552). Sixteen
of the 40 cases aged 17 to 40 years, and one of the nine cases aged <17
years reported attending a "rave" party during the exposure period.
"Raves" are very large gatherings of teenagers and young adults who listen
and dance to electronic music in warehouse type venues. Of the risk
factors examined, exposure to rave parties was the most strongly associated
with illness (odds ratio = 17, 95% CI = 2.7 to 710). All "rave" attendees
reported sharing drinks and dancing in close proximity to others.
Attending educational institutions, having contact with >50 persons per day
at work, being a health-care professional, attending dance clubs, bars, or
other social events, and playing group sports were not associated with
illness.
The increased incidence rates in this outbreak suggest that the 1957 to
1980 birth cohorts were most at risk. These incompletely vaccinated birth
cohorts sustain an adult population susceptible to outbreaks of mumps in
the future. This investigation highlights, as previously described, the
high proportion of extra-salivary symptoms of mumps experienced by an adult
population.
This is the second communicable disease outbreak reported to be associated
with "rave" parties in Canada, the first being a 1996 meningitis outbreak
in Quebec. These social events, characterized by close contact and sharing
of drinks, should be considered as a risk factor for mumps and other
illnesses transmissible by person-to-person droplet spread.
In response to the outbreak and this investigation, the V/RHB released a
public notice about "raves" as a risk factor for acquiring mumps and a
reminder about MMR vaccinations.
