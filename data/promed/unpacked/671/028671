In the 1st 6 months of this year [2018], Alagoas reported 63 cases of leishmaniasis, also known as kala-azar in humans, a number 30 percent higher than what was reported during the entire year 2017. The disease is serious and can lead to death if not treated correctly.

According to the State Secretary of Health (Sesau), there were 48 cases reported during the entire year 2017.

The largest part of the reported cases of the disease in humans in the recent months was concentrated in the Alagoan Sertao. The cities with the most number of cases of kala-azar are: Estrela de Alagoas (11), Palmeira dos Indios (8), Girau do Ponciano (5), and Santana do Ipanema (4).

In the same period, there was also an increase in reports of infected dogs, the principle host of visceral leishmaniasis. From January to December 2017, there were 69 cases of canine kala-azar. Notably, in the 1st semester of 2018, the cases reached 350.

In general, transmission occurs through the sandfly that bites a dog infected with the protozoa _Leishmania chagasi_ and is the vector of the disease. In this manner the insects infect humans and other animals.

Noteworthy, Sesau informed that the municipal health agents should strengthen case finding in both humans and dogs. He also said that when the disease is identified in dogs, they should be sent for tests, and treatment. When the result is known and the disease is confirmed, and if treatment is unsuccessful, the animal should be euthanized.

The secretary also explained that infected people should begin treatment at the health facilities closest to them and to complement this with treatment/assessment at the Helvio Auto School Hospital, the state reference hospital.

Veterinarian Edson Moura explained that the treatment of animals with leishmaniasis was authorized by a 2013 decision of the Federal Superior Tribunal (STF). There is a medication used in the treatment which is non-curative, but it kills the parasite on the skin of the animal, preventing the vector from transmitting the disease to others. And it is important to know that all of mammals are hosts of leishmaniasis, but as our immunity is better than that of dogs, the disease manifests itself more in them," affirmed the veterinarian.

He concluded saying that the euthanasia of the animals will not decrease the incidence of the disease. "There are many written articles related to this. The dog serves as a sentinel for the society. If there are many cases of the disease in animals, especially in dogs, the health secretariat should be notified to review how to implement vector control. This is the question."

Sesau also reinforced the monitoring of municipalities with the highest number of cases and ensured that it will enable the teams to confirm the diagnosis faster and avoid underreporting.

[Northeast Brazil is the main endemic region for leishmaniasis of Brazil. A recent study of the epidemiology of _Leishmania_ in humans and dogs in Alagoas state found that 9.9 percent of investigated dogs were seropositive (Rocha MAN et al. Epidemiological aspects of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in State of Alagoas, Northeast, Brazil. Braz J Biol. 2018; 78(4): 609-14. doi: 10.1590/1519-6984.166622; http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1519-69842018005004101).

The study by Reis et al (Reis LLD et al. Changes in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil from 2001 to 2014. Rev Soc Brasil Med Trop 2017; 50(5): 638-45. doi: 10.1590/0037-8682-0243-2017; http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0037-86822017000500638) provides good maps of the endemicity per 100 000 population. - Mod.EP
