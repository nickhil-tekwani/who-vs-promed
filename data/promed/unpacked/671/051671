A comment on the current Ebola virus outbreak in Uganda
-----------------------------------------------
There is much understandable but sometimes inaccurate commentary in
the reports on recent Ebola virus outbreaks on ProMED. One error
concerns the amount of gross hemorrhage in previous epidemics with
both the Zaire and Sudan species of the agent. Despite lay reports of
major bleeds from nose, other orifices and eyes, the amount of blood
lost externally in the syndrome has never been significant. Indeed,
this fact frequently produces difficulty in making a probable
clinical diagnosis in the early phase of febrile illness.

I do not think that the putative clinical differences cited in the
current Uganda outbreak should be used in any way to give support to
the notion of a new viral species. Moderator caution regarding that
question is rightly expressed. What could be significant is the
possible mortality rate described. When diagnostic capability is
established in the region, it will be important to seek samples from
those putatively recovered, once the work of confirming active cases
settles down.
