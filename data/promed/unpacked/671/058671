Chikungunya spreads in West Lombok
----------------------------------
Chikungunya epidemic has struck at least 2 subdistricts in West Lombok
regency in the past week, infecting and paralyzing dozens of residents in
the area.
Thamrin Hijaz, a senior official at the West Lombok Health Office, said on
Wednesday that 48 people in Gunung Sari subdistrict and 55 others in the
neighboring subdistrict of Belencong had been infected with the virus. "The
disease is not lethal. Infected people may see their health improve in 2-3
days, but it could be as long as 10 days before there is any improvement.
All depends on the patient's stamina," said Thamrin.
Chikungunya, like dengue fever, is contracted through a mosquito bite and
is characterized by an extremely high fever, but differs in its symptom of
severe joint pain (arthralgia) that lasts for up to a week. The disease was
first recognized in epidemic form in East Africa in 1952, while in
Indonesia, the disease was first reported in 1973 in Samarinda, East
Kalimantan. Its name comes from the Swahili word chikungunya, which means
"that which contorts or bends up", referring to the contorted posture of
patients afflicted with the disease's predominant symptom of arthralgia.

[Chikungunya fever is similar yet basically distinct from dengue fever in
terms of the causal agents. Briefly, both diseases are mosquitoborne viral
infections with high febrile reactions and joint pains. ProMED-mail reviews
in the commentaries (such as "Chikungunya - Comoros (Ngazidja)
20050405.0986" and many others) remind readers that human infections of
chikungunya are acquired through the bite of infected _Stegomyia aegypti_
(formerly known as _Aedes aegypti_) mosquitoes, and epidemics are sustained
by human-mosquito-human transmission. The epidemic cycle is thus similar to
those of dengue and urban yellow fever.
Since 1954, the virus has been implicated as the cause of epidemics in
Asian countries including the Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam,
India, Burma, and Sri Lanka. Epidemics of chikungunya were documented in
the Philippines in 1954, 1956, and 1968. Serosurveys suggest that there was
virus activity in the central and southern part of the archipelago.
Chikungunya virus has been isolated from humans and mosquitoes in eastern,
southern, western, and central Africa and in south eastern Asia, where it
has been responsible for hundreds to thousands of cases of illness.
Chikungunya fever is characterized by sudden onset of chills and fever,
headache, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, and rash. Compared with dengue,
chikungunya is distinguished by a briefer incubation period and febrile
episode, by persistent arthralgia in some cases, and by the absence of
fatalities. However, similarities between clinical appearances of the 2
diseases probably account for misclassification and some underreporting of
chikungunya fever in areas with endemic dengue; therefore, laboratory
confirmation of reported cases is important. The IgM-capture ELISA used for
diagnosis of these patients is especially useful in this regard. For a more
detailed description please see also: MMWR 1986; 35(36): 573-4, Sep 12. -
