Suspected Case of Murray Valley Encephalitis in Northern Territory
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Widespread Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus activity has heightened
concerns for the safety of Northern Territory (NT) residents and visitors.
Recent reports of MVE virus activity throughout the Kimberley and Pilbara
regions of Western Australia, the entire Northern Territory, Western
Queensland and Western NSW have raised the need for widespread community
and health care provider awareness. Risk of acquiring the illness now
extends across much of northern Australia.
There has been one documented case of MVE in a child in Queensland. Today,
the Centre for Disease Control received notification of a suspected case of
MVE in a 49-year-old resident of Alice Springs. We expect confirmation
within the next 48 hours.
MVE is a potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease. Symptoms of MVE include
severe headache, neck stiffness, high fevers, seizures (especially in young
children) and in some cases progression to delirium and coma. People
experiencing these symptoms should seek medical attention at once.
Due to exceptionally high numbers of the transmitting mosquitoes, the areas
most at risk presently are the regions of Victoria River, Barkly and Alice
Springs. Recent sentinel chicken studies have demonstrated evidence of MVE
[virus infection in both Tennant Creek and Alice Springs. MVE virus
activity has also been detected in the Top End and therefore all NT
residents are urged to take precautions against mosquito bites. Ongoing
rains and current climatic conditions mean that the risk will extend for at
least the next 2 months.
The Centre for Disease Control continues to urge people to be aware of the
widespread MVE virus activity. People planning bush or camping trips are
especially warned to avoid areas of surface water where mosquito breeding
is likely. Residents and travellers are urged to take appropriate actions
to protect themselves from mosquito bites. Of concern are the approaching
school holidays. At a time when many individuals, community and school
groups may be planning travel to areas with elevated risk, Territory Health
Services advise that people should be fully prepared to take all measures
to avoid mosquito bites before travel. People living in the region are
urged to avoid being outside when mosquitoes are active. This is
particularly after sundown and through the early evening, but the
mosquitoes will bite throughout the night. People most at risk are babies,
young children and newcomers to the region via employment or travel.
However, anyone can potentially contract the disease.
Every effort is always made to control mosquitoes and mosquito breeding
sites around major towns, but the area is so large and breeding sites so
extensive or inaccessible that effective mosquito control is not always
possible. People need to respect the potential disease threats, take
precautions to avoid mosquito bites and especially take responsibility for
protecting babies and young children. There is no specific treatment or
vaccine available and commitment by all residents and travellers throughout
the NT to personal mosquito bite protection is needed.
