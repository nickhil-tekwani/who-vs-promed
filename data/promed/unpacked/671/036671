Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease surveillance in the UK: 10th Annual Report
--------------------------------------------------------------------
[N.B. Variant CJD is abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail]
10th Annual Report: Section 1 - Summary
The national surveillance programme for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in
the UK was initiated in May 1990. In 1999, the National CJD Surveillance
Unit (NCJDSU) became a WHO Collaborative Centre for Reference and Research
on the Surveillance and Epidemiology of Human Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathies (TSEs). In September 2001 the National Care Team was
formed, comprising 2 care co-ordinators, a neurologist (part-time), and a
secretary. The National Care Team is based within the NCJDSU and was formed
in response to concerns regarding the care of CJD patients.
The information provided in this tenth report continues to provide evidence
of a high level of case ascertainment. Detailed clinical and
epidemiological information has been obtained for the great majority of
patients and the case-control study for CJD has been extended for variant
CJD, with up to 4 community controls studied in addition to the hospital
controls. The post mortem rate for patients with suspected CJD is high,
although there is recent evidence that the autopsy rates have declined, in
line with autopsy rates in the UK generally following the Alder Hey Inquiry.
In 1990-2001 mortality rates from sporadic CJD in England, Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland were, respectively, 0.77, 0.85, 1.03 and
0.52/million/year. The difference between the rates in each country is not
statistically significant (p>0.2). These rates are comparable to those
observed in other countries in Europe and elsewhere in the world, including
countries which are free of BSE. There was some variation in the observed
mortality rates between the different regions within the UK but this
variation is not statistically significant (p>0.2). The highest and lowest
mortality rates from sporadic CJD were observed in the South West (SMR=129)
and East and West Midlands regions of England (both SMR=83).
Up to 31 Dec 2001, there have been 104 deaths from definite or probable
variant CJD (vCJD) in the UK. Of these, 89 were confirmed
neuropathologically with one additional case awaiting neuropathological
confirmation. The clinical, neuropathological and epidemiological features
of all these cases of vCJD are remarkably uniform and consistent with our
previous descriptions. Analysis of the incidence of vCJD onsets and deaths
from Jan 1994 to Dec 2001 shows evidence of an annual increase of around 20
percent for both onsets and deaths but, because of the considerable
uncertainties over the incubation period for vCJD, continuing surveillance
will be required to establish whether this trend is sustained in future years.
Risk factors for the development of vCJD include age, residence in the UK
and methionine homozygosity at codon 129 of the prion protein gene; 98
cases of vCJD with available genetic analysis have all been methionine
homozygotes. The analyses in this report do not provide conclusive evidence
of an increased risk of vCJD associated with past surgery, previous blood
transfusion, occupation, or a range of dietary factors. However, the power
of the case-control study, from which these results are derived, is limited
by the relatively small number of cases and controls.
Cases of vCJD are reported to have consumed products potentially containing
mechanically recovered meat (such as sausages and burgers) more frequently
than community controls. However, care should be taken in interpreting this
result, as there is considerable scope for recall bias with respect to
dietary history. The incidence of vCJD across the UK continues to show a
"North-South" divide, with a higher incidence being maintained in the North
of the UK. The underlying reason for this finding is not clear and further
investigations are required to investigate the possible aetiology. The only
statistically significant cluster of vCJD cases in the UK is in
Leicestershire; geographically associated cases of vCJD are subject to
detailed investigation, which involves the NCJDSU, colleagues at CDSC and
local public health physicians.
The activities of the NCJDSU are strengthened by collaboration in other
surveillance projects, including the Transfusion Medicine Epidemiology
Review and the study of Progressive Intellectual and Neurological
Deterioration in Children. The collaboration of our colleagues in these
projects is greatly appreciated. The success of the project continues to
depend on the extraordinary level of co-operation from the neuroscience
community and other medical and paramedical staff throughout the UK. We are
particularly grateful to the relatives of patients for their help with this
study.

figures and tables.

CJD cases "will increase"
--------------------------
Cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, the human form of mad cow
disease, are set to increase by about 20 percent each year, experts have
predicted. But scientists at the National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh stress numbers will still be very small. In their latest report
(see above), they said the "north-south divide", where the incidence is
higher in Scotland and northern England, will continue. The report
predicted there would be 32 deaths from vCJD, the human form of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), this year.
The report said: "The upward trend in vCJD cases continues to be
statistically significant with an increase of 21 percent per year for
onsets and 23 percent per year for deaths. "The incidence of vCJD across
the UK continues to show a north-south divide, with a higher incidence
being maintained in the north of the UK." But scientists stress the number
of cases is small, and say the only "statistically significant cluster" of
vCJD cases occurred in Leicestershire. There, health officials suggested
meat preparation techniques used by local butchers in the 1980s could have
led to cross-contamination of muscle meat with brain tissue.
But Professor Peter Smith, chairman of SEAC, the Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee, told BBC News Online: "They are the best estimates at
the rate at which cases have been going up. But there is quite a lot of
uncertainty." Professor Smith added: "When vCJD was first described, people
felt that, because so many people could potentially have eaten infected
meat, that there could have been an epidemic of tens of thousands. But as
time has gone on, that has looked far less likely."
