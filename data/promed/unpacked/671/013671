Russia Reports Case of Newcastle Virus Near Ukraine
---------------------------------------------------
Russia has reported an outbreak of the highly contagious poultry virus,
Newcastle disease, among chickens in a southern region near Ukraine,
Interfax news agency said on Friday.
Officials in the regional administration in Bryansk declined to confirm the
report. Russia is a major poultry importer.
The virus is fatal for fowl but harmless to humans.
Interfax said 650 chickens had already died from the disease on private
farms. The disease is different to avian flu, the virus that has recently
devastated poultry in several Asian countries, but it can also wipe out
entire flocks.
Vaccination and other measures to fend off the outbreak are under way, Ivan
Vasilenko, a regional epidemiological official, told Interfax.
The disease may have come from migratory birds such as pigeons, presumably
from Ukraine, "where the situation with this disease has been quite
alarming," Vasilenko said.
An official in Ukraine's veterinarian inspectorate told Reuters in Kiev
that there was no Newcastle disease in Ukraine.
In March 2004, Belgium reported an outbreak of the disease among pet
pigeons in the northwest of the country.
The disease affects the birds' respiratory, nervous and digestive systems.
It spreads mainly via direct contact between healthy birds and the bodily
discharges of infected birds.

[The last outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) in Ukraine was reported to the
OIE in 1992. Russia reported 2 outbreaks in 2003, one in the Lipetsk region
(May), the other one (in a monthly -- October -- report) in the Belgorodsk
region; both adjacent to the Ukrainian border.
Not all pigeon variant viruses (PPMV-1) show virulence for chickens, but
some have caused serious outbreaks. The OIE definition for reporting an
outbreak of ND is:
"Newcastle disease is defined as an infection of birds caused by a virus of
avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1) that meets one of the following
criteria for virulence:
a) The virus has an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old
chicks (_Gallus gallus_) of 0.7 or greater.
or
b) Multiple basic amino acids have been demonstrated in the virus (either
directly or by deduction) at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and
phenylalanine at residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F1 protein.
The term 'multiple basic amino acids' refers to at least 3 arginine or
lysine residues between residues 113 and 116. Failure to demonstrate the
characteristic pattern of amino acid residues as described above would
require characterisation of the isolated virus by an ICPI test.
In this definition, amino acid residues are numbered from the N-terminus of
the amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the F0
gene, 113-116 corresponds to residues -4 to -1 from the cleavage site."
