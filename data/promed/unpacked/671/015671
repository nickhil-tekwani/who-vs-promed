A Lowndes County mosquito pool has tested positive for EEE, or eastern equine encephalitis [virus], according to the South Health District. The South Health District said this is the 1st positive pool testing notification of 2021. The health district also said that Georgians should take precautions to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses.

"Taking the necessary steps to protect yourself and your family from mosquito bites is the best defense we have against mosquito-borne illnesses," said Kenneth Lowery, district epidemiologist. "While we do see mosquito-borne illnesses in our district every year, that does not mean that we should become complacent about taking precautions."

The health district said most mosquito-borne illnesses are transmitted to humans and animals from a bite of an infected mosquito. The South Health District gave the following tips to prevent mosquito bites:

- Use insect repellent containing DEET, picardin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing.
- Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits.
- Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out.
- Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flowerpots, buckets, barrels, wading pools, and other containers. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out.
- Be sure to use repellent and wear protective clothing from dusk to dawn or consider indoor activities during these times due to peak mosquito biting hours.

[Finding an eastern equine encephalitis virus-positive mosquito pool in Georgia is not surprising. The virus is endemic along the east coast of the USA, including Georgia. There was an equine and a human case in Georgia in 2019. People should heed the advice offered by the South Health District for avoiding mosquito bites. A commercial vaccine is available for equine animals but not for humans. Owners of equine animals should vaccinate their animals. - Mod.TY
