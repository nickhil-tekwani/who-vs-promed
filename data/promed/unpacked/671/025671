[As of today's [31 Dec 2016] report, there have been a total of 1522 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 632 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012, with a reported case-fatality rate of 41.5%. These reports include approximately 87 asymptomatic infections identified through contact tracing and reported by the Saudi MOH (according to a spreadsheet of cases I have been maintaining).

During this year (2016), there have been a total of: 239 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia, including 80 deaths, bringing the reported case-fatality rate for 2016 to 33.5% , more in keeping with the global tally maintained by WHO of 1864 cases including 659 deaths reported to WHO from 27 countries, since September 2012, for a global case fatality rate due to MERS-CoV infection of 35.4% (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/).

Note that the global data on numbers of cases reported to WHO include cases and deaths reported by Saudi Arabia through 13 Dec 2016. Since 13 Dec 2016, there have been an additional 14 cases and 7 deaths confirmed and reported on the Saudi MOH website, bringing the global total of confirmed MERS-CoV infections to 1878 including 666 deaths, with Saudi Arabia accounting for 81% of the reported cases. A map showing the geographic locations worldwide where cases have been reported can be found at the WHO URL provided earlier in this paragraph. In addition, the same URL link has an epidemic curve of reported cases of MERS-CoV.

Looking at monthly reporting of cases in Saudi Arabia during 2016, the months with peak numbers of reports include March (55 cases), June (46 cases), December (31 cases), November (20 cases) and February (20 Cases). February, March and June 2016 involved major nosocomial transmission, but November and December 2016 were primarily primary cases with minimal secondary cases (2 asymptomatic healthcare workers identified through contact tracing, and 2 household contacts, one of whom was asymptomatic and identified through contact tracing). Other months reported 14 cases per month (October and April 2016), 12 cases (July 2016), 8 cases (August and September 2016), 7 cases and 4 cases (May 2016).

Based on earlier years experiences, it appears as though nosocomial transmission in Saudi Arabia has been markedly reduced, suggesting major improvements in infection control activities as well as increased awareness of MERS-CoV infection so that more cases are being identified earlier on in their presentation to the health sector.

Maps showing the locations of reported cases can be found at the source URLs provided for each case, and can be found on a daily basis on the source URL provided at the beginning of this report.
