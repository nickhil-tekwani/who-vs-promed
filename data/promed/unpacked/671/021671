[Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal disease of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus Lagovirus). http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf.

RHD is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. Outbreaks have also been reported from domesticated rabbits in the Middle East and the Americas. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf

There is no indication that the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus infects humans. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf
