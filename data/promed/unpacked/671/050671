Cockle imports from Thailand have been suspended in Hong Kong because a
sixth person came down with cholera yesterday after eating the shellfish, a
health official said. All six contracted the disease in the past two weeks
after eating uncooked or undercooked cockles imported from Thailand, said
John Tam, a health department spokesman. Mr. Tam said seafood wholesalers
have voluntarily suspended cockle imports from Thailand since the
government issued a cholera alert last week. He said the government will
not seek to ban the imports, but will heighten surveillance on Thai cockles
in the future.
The cholera outbreak has raised concerns because it comes months before the
summer cholera season.
