Bovine tuberculosis found in 2 dairy herds
--------------------------------
Tuberculosis has been found in 2 dairy herds in Roosevelt County,
New Mexico Cattle Growers Association president Phil Bidegain said.
The detection of bovine tuberculosis means the state will be
reclassified from its tuberculosis free status under the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's tuberculosis rule developed in 2000.

"While this reclassification will have virtually no impact on
consumers of beef and milk in New Mexico or elsewhere, it will have
tremendous impact on livestock producers in the state," Bidegain, of
Tucumcari, said. "New Mexico is the 4th state to fall under the
federal tuberculosis rule. It has already been detected in Michigan,
Texas and California," Bidegain said.

The drop in status will require beef and dairy cattle owners
transporting cattle out of New Mexico to test for tuberculosis.
Ranchers would have to give each animal an injection [tuberculine
test] and put them in a chute to read the test 3 days later. All
infected animals in a herd must be killed.

A lack of large animal veterinarians in the state could also make
testing difficult, Bidegain said.

Under the USDA tuberculosis rule, the state must now develop a
plan on how it will regain its tuberculosis free status.

Texas ranchers have said more restrictions should be placed on
Mexican herds entering the United States after the discovery of
tuberculosis in dairy cows in Pecos County and beef cattle in
Fayette County last year [2002]. Although the government required
all breeder herds in Texas to be tested, it waived the requirement for
feeder cattle. Ranchers in Texas have said the best way to wipe out
the disease is by controlling high-risk animals, including dairy herds
and cattle from Mexico and other places where bovine tuberculosis
is prevalent.

Bidegain said the state may opt to regionalize, which means only
livestock in a designated region must be tested. The rest of the state
would be allowed to move cattle under the current system. But he
warns that the plan development and approval period could take up
to 2 years.

[Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial disease caused by the
acid-fast, slow-growing rod-shaped _Mycobacterium bovis_;
transmission to humans constitutes a public health problem.

Aerosol exposure to _M. bovis_ is considered to be the most
frequent route of infection of cattle, but infection by ingestion of
contaminated material also occurs. Characteristic tuberculous
lesions occur most frequently in the lungs and the retropharyngeal,
bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes. Lesions can also be found
in the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, on serous membranes,
and in other organs. - Mod.AS]
