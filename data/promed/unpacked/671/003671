Our balcony in Lewes attracts a lot of birds, especially greenfinches. In the past week we have found 2 greenfinches dead on my balcony.

We had thought that several of them had looked rather odd. They were all puffed up as if against the cold, yet it was summer. We thought they must be due to moulting, but no. They were suffering from trichomoniasis, a disease caused by a microscopic parasite. I contacted the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). They informed me that since 2005 there have been outbreaks during the late summer and autumn.

They have been studied by the Garden Bird Health Initiative, of which the RSPB is part. Greenfinch populations have been recorded dropping by a 3rd, and chaffinch populations by a 5th in those parts of the country that suffer the most serious outbreaks.

Other finches and house sparrows are also susceptible. Trichomoniasis cannot be passed on to humans.

The trichomonad parasite lives in the bird's digestive tract. It progressively blocks the bird's throat, making it unable to swallow food. The bird dies from starvation.

Birds with the disease show signs of general illness, for example lethargy and fluffed-up plumage, but affected birds may also drool saliva, regurgitate food, have difficulty in swallowing, or show laboured breathing.

Finches are frequently seen to have matted, wet plumage around the face and beak, and uneaten food in and around the beak. In some cases, swelling of the neck may be seen from a distance.

What to do if you spot the symptoms -- the RSPB recommends you temporarily stop putting out food, and leave bird baths dry until sick or dead birds are no longer found in the garden.

This is to discourage birds from congregating together, which may increase the potential for the disease to spread between individuals.

Everyone can help generally by ensuring they regularly clean feeders, bird baths and feeding surfaces.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes), which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis [inflammation of the crop in fowl]. Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite infrequently infects other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.
