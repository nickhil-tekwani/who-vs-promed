The News Office of China's Ministry of Agriculture announced on 2 Apr
2010 that type O bovine FMD has occurred in Xinzhou City, Shanxi
Province. The outbreak has now been brought under control.

On 25 Mar 2010, the Animal Health Inspection Station of Xinxing Gorge
Highway in Xinjiang's Hami District, intercepted 18 sick cattle from
Xinfu District of Xinzhou City in Shanxi Province. No cattle had died.
On 1 Apr 2010, the National FMD Reference Laboratory confirmed type O
bovine FMD.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver

[China submitted the information above to the OIE in its follow-up
report No 3, on 1 Apr 2010, available -- with map -- at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9102>.

The following information, pertaining to the affected population, is
included in the said follow-up report:

"On 25 Mar 2010, 18 cattle, shipped from Xinfu district (Xinzhou city,
Shanxi province), were found to show FMD clinical signs in a routine
inspection carried out by inspectors of Xingxingxia Highway Animal
Health Supervision and Inspection Station, which is located in Hami
prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. 98 cattle were destroyed
immediately including the 18 infected cattle and urgent inspections
were conducted by related veterinary departments of Shanxi province
and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region according to the related law and
regulations. No other cases were found."

This is the 4th FMDV-O outbreak reported from China since the start of
this event on 22 Feb 2010, and the 1st one found in cattle; the 3
previous outbreaks involved swine. FMD virus serotype O is generally
known to be a fast-spreading (invasive) virus, affecting multiple
animal species (bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine). Since the infected
animals were, reportedly, in transit and not yet unloaded to contact
local animals, the Chinese authorities attribute this outbreak to the
province of origin, namely Shanxi, and not to the territory where the
consignment was intercepted, namely the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region. If no cases have been detected in Shanxi, the question remains
where and when have the transported animals been infected? The virus
may be more widely spread throughout China, to be discovered and
reported.

Another FMDV serotype (A) has been spreading in China since early
2009, so far, reportedly affecting only bovines. There was also a
single report on serotype Asia 1 in bovines -- see ProMED posts
referenced below.- Mod.AS]
