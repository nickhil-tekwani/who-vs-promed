WHO COMMUNICABLE DISEASE NEWS, 21 MARCH 1996
============================================
Disease outbreaks reported
(page updated when new information becomes available)

21 March:

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
The UK has analyzed cases of CJD that have occurred in 10 adults below 42
years of age during the past year. The disease in these cases differs from
classical CJD in several respects:
- early age (CJD is usually a disease of older people)
- differences in pathological changes in the brain
- absence of any hereditary factors (which are involved in typical
CJD)

There is no direct evidence of a link between these cases and
bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE). However, in the absence of any
apparent cause, the most likely explanation at present is that these
cases are linked to exposure to BSE before control measures were
instituted in the UK in 1989. The measures now in force in the UK are
considered to have minimized any possible risk from eating beef.

No similar pattern of disease has been recognized in humans in any
other country although BSE has also occurred in animals in Ireland,
France, Portugal, and Switzerland. Precautions have been taken in
these countries to avoid any possible risk to people from beef
consumption.

WHO recommends that national health authorities be notified if any
unusual occurrence of CJD is recognized in any other country.


19 March:

Cerebrospinal meningitis
Over 38 000 cases and over 5 000 deaths caused by cerebrospinal
meningitis have been reported in 11 countries in the African Region
since the beginning of the year. Most of these have been reported in
association with outbreaks in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and
Nigeria. According to the most update received from the WHO Regional
Office the following number of cases (deaths) had been reported:
Benin: 362 (46); Burkina Faso: 9 532 (859); Cameroon: 5 (1); Central
African Republic: 155 (22); Chad: 244 (19); Ghana:18 (0); Mali: 787
(158); Niger: 5 529 (584); Nigeria: 20 982 (3 634); Tanzania: 99(8);
