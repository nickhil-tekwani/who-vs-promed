BSE - Possibility of blood-borne transmission
---------------------------------------------
The human version of mad-cow disease can be spread by blood transfusion,
according to preliminary research published today in the medical journal
Lancet. These early findings place a question mark over the safety of blood
transfusions, as the agent can be transmitted even before a blood donor
shows any symptoms of the disease, the researchers suggest. [New variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob [nvCJD disease is caused by the same agent as mad-cow
disease, in which a mutant form of a protein called the prion proliferates,
causing sponge-like holes to form in the brain. Eating beef contaminated by
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), as mad-cow disease is called, is an
identified path of catching new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. But
until now, data have been unclear or contested as to whether it can also be
passed on in blood transfusions. Scientists at the Institute for Animal
Health in Edinburgh say they fed a breed of British sheep a sample of brain
from cattle infected with BSE. Sheep were chosen as they harbor the
infectious agent in tissues other than the brain and spinal cord, as do
humans. Blood was taken from 19 infected sheep before any symptoms were
apparent, and was transfused into healthy sheep imported from New Zealand.
After 610 days, one of the transfused sheep began to show signs of the
disease. All the others are healthy at present, although most are at an
earlier stage after transfusion than the affected sheep. While
acknowledging that their study still had several years to run and so far
only one animal had fallen sick, the scientists said this early finding was
"sufficiently important" to announce right now. "This report suggests that
blood donated by nvCJD-infected human beings may represent a risk of spread
of nvCJD infection among the population of the UK," they said.
It should now be possible to identify which cells were infected and develop
a diagnostic test for nvCJD based on a blood sample, they said. That would
also help to test the effectiveness of a 2-year-old British policy which
seeks to eliminate the likeliest source of nvCJD transmission by stripping
out white blood cells from blood donations.
Meanwhile, researchers from France's National Centre of Scientific Research
reported today that nvCJD could be promoted [sic by normal prions as well
as abnormal ones. 3 types of non-mutant prions played a role in a complex
"cascade" of enzyme signals that govern brain-cell functions, they said in
work published in the US weekly Science. This discovery could ultimately
throw up possible treatments for nvCJD by designing drugs that block or
alter the signalling process.

[The paper entitled, Transmission of BSE by blood transfusion in sheep by F
Houston, J D Foster, Angela Chong, N Hunter, C J Bostock, is published in
the 16 Sep 2000 issue of Lancet(the Lancet 2000; 356: 999 -1000). The
authors state that it is well known that new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (nvCJD) is caused by the same strain of agent that causes bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle. Their experiment involved
transfusing blood from 19 UK Cheviot sheep fed with 5 g BSE-affected cattle
brain into Cheviot sheep from a scrapie-free flock of New Zealand-derived
animals. Houston et al. found clinical signs and pathology characteristic
of BSE in one recipient of blood taken from a BSE infected animal.
Immunocytochemistry on tissues taken from the transfused animal showed
widespread PrPSC deposition throughout the brain and the periphery. This
finding suggests that blood donated by symptom-free nvCJD-infected human
beings could transmit infection to recipients of blood transfusions.
Although these observations are consistent with previous reports in
experimentally infected rodents, they are very preliminary and appear to
lack an appropriate control experiment.
The final tantalizingly brief paragraph of this report describes unrelated
work, of perhaps greater significance in the longer term, revealing new
aspects of the propagation of prions. -Mod.CP
