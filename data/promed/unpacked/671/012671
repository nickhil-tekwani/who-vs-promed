A diagnosis of Hendra virus (HeV; equine morbillivirus) in a horse has been
confirmed by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. The diagnosis is
based on histology, immuno-peroxidase and PCR [polymerase chain reaction
testing of formalised lung tissue, and electron microscopy.
The case involves an adult, thoroughbred mare kept for polocrosse [a sport.
The mare
died early on 18 January 1999 after an illness lasting 24 hours. Clinical
signs included anorexia, depression, gait abnormality, ataxia and facial
edema. At death large quantities of froth flowed from the nostrils. This
froth was described as yellow in color. The appearance of the sclera
suggested some jaundice.
The horse was one of two kept on a 1.5 hectare paddock within the
residential area of a beachside community near Cairns. The second horse was
sampled on 8 February 1999 and has tested negative for HeV by ELISA
[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Both horses occupied the paddock
continuously for the past two months with no reported horse movement onto
or away from the paddock.
Previous research has shown that HeV antibody can occur in flying foxes,
large bats of the genus _Pteropus_. The paddock contains trees that are
occasionally visited by spectacled flying foxes.
This is the first evidence of this disease in a horse since the virus was
first recognised in September 1994. In October 1995, a human case occurred
and traceback showed contact in August 1994 with two horses that were
subsequently shown to be infected. In 1995 an extensive retrospective study
of laboratory records and stored specimens did not detect any other cases.
Intensive surveillance has been maintained in Queensland since that time
and horses with suspicious signs followed up for HeV exclusion.
>From the history of these horses and the disease's epidemiological pattern
it seems clear that infection of this mare has not originated from another
horse, nor has any lateral spread occurred to other horses. It seems likely
that spread has occurred in this case from a natural host, probably a
flying fox. Such an occurrence is a very rare event, with only three known
foci of infection ever having been recorded.

[I wonder if we will be hearing more about human cases from those in
contact with this mare - Mod.TG
[This virus continues to fascinate. Little or no disease in horses; none
or rare transmission from horse to horse; the unfortunate and rare
transmission from horse to human; no transmission between humans. This
virus must be barely hanging on in nature (flying foxes) but somehow
maintained between flying foxes. Are there any experimental transmission
data with flying foxes? Early studies of rabies in bats might serve as
models for such studies. Rick Steece and I were fortunate enough to
isolate a strain of rabies virus from fetal bat tissues ( Steece, R. and
C.H. Calisher. Isolation of rabies virus from fetal tissues of _Tadarida
braziliensis_. J. Wildl. Dis. 25:329-334, 1989); someone might look at
fetal flying fox tissues and perhaps get lucky. - Mod CHC
