Rift Valley fever in Yemen - Update 2
-------------------------------------
As of 2 Oct 2000, 321 suspected cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) with 32
deaths have been reported in the Yemen. The epicentre of the outbreak is in
Wadi Mawr, El-Zuhrah district in Hodeidah Governorate.
A total of 8 teams of physicians and veterinarians are conducting active
surveillance in the outbreak area. The mean age of affected patients is
36.5 years (range 2 months to 90 years). Confirmed cases of disease have
been detected in villages throughout Wadi Mawr. Laboratory capability has
been established to detect IgM and IgG class antibody to RVF [virus. Of 59
persons who met the suspect case definition, 29 (51%) had anti-RVF [virus
IgM antibody. Results of surveys in animals from the outbreak area and
adjacent Wadis will be available in the next few days. Surveillance for
disease in animals has detected considerable morbidity and mortality in
sheep, goats and cattle (most of which has been reported in Wadi Mawr).
Surveillance in humans and animals is ongoing in these sites to determine
the extent of possible transmission. Surveillance data in humans and
animals is being used to define high-risk areas which are being targeted
for vector control. This outbreak has occurred at the same time as the
outbreak of RVF in Saudi Arabia. WHO advises that persons can travel freely
to and from both the Yemen and Saudi Arabia. Persons travelling within the
affected districts should wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and should
use mosquito repellent and bed-nets, and avoid contact with sick livestock.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is suspected, but RVF virus has not been isolated
yet in the Yemen. Since the last official statement from the Yemen, the
number of suspected cases has risen from 134 to 321, whereas the number of
deaths has risen only by 1 from 31 to 32. This brings the case:fatality
ratio (321/32) well below that (223/53) recorded so far in the concurrent
outbreak across the border in Saudi Arabia, suggesting that the extent of
the outbreak in Saudi Arabia is being under-reported. -Mod.CP.
