To offer some clarity regarding the recent reports of encephalitis
outbreaks in Uttar Pradesh (UP), Assam, and Nagaland, we would like to
share information we have gathered through our collaboration with the
Government of India.

Since January 2009, UP has recorded 665 acute encephalitis syndrome (AES)
cases. Samples were collected and tested for all cases, and 34 cases and 4
deaths were laboratory-confirmed as Japanese encephalitis (JE) All 4 deaths
occurred in unvaccinated children, 2 children among the surviving cases had
received JE vaccine. The National Institute of Virology continues to
investigate the cause(s) of other AES cases.

From 2006-2008, JE vaccination campaigns for children 1-15 years of age
were held in 27 districts in UP. This year [2009], campaigns in UP were
held in May in 7 additional districts: Allahabad, Pratapgarh, Fatehpur,
Kanpur (urban), Ghazipur, Jaunpur, and Shahjahanpur. The reported coverage
for the 2009 campaigns was 84.6 per cent.

In Assam, according to the Government of India, 109 AES cases were reported
from July-August 2009. Of these, 33 were JE cases, of which 10 adults and 5
children (all unvaccinated) died. Non-JE AES samples are being tested at
the Regional Medical Research Center to determine other etiologies, and
results are expected soon.

A total of 6 districts of upper Assam were covered in JE vaccination
campaigns held in 2006-2008, targeting children 1-15 years of age
(Dibrugarh, Jorhat, Tinsukia, Sivsagar, Golaghat, and Dhemaji). This year
[2009], campaigns were held in May in Lakhimpur (upper Assam), Sonitpur
(middle Assam), and Kamrup (lower Assam), with an overall reported coverage
of 74 per cent.

Nagaland was not included in the national government's initial plan to
target high-risk districts throughout the country. However, given the
recent outbreak situation, the Government of India is considering whether
to include additional states, such as Nagaland, Manipur, and Uttaranchal
for next year's [2010] JE vaccination campaigns.

[ProMED-mail thanks Deborah Phillips for this report, confirming Japanese
encephalitis (JE) virus as the etiologic agent responsible for some of the
AES cases, and providing information about the status of the Indian
government's JE vaccination campaign in this area. ProMED awaits with
interest information on the etiological agent responsible for the remaining
AES cases.
