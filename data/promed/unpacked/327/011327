Ukraine's first case of anthrax in a human this year has been reported in
the southern village of Maksymivka. The 37-year-old man, now hospitalized,
helped a neighbor kill and process the meat of a cow that had fallen ill.
Symptoms of the disease appeared two days later. Several other exposed
people were hospitalized to receive prophylactic treatment.
There is concern about additional cases because the meat from the
slaughtered cow was sold to a meat trader. Inspectors from epidemiologic
stations in the region have been dispatched to local markets, and village
animals are being vaccinated.
