About 2,500 cases of cholera have been admitted to hospitals in Nyanza
Province. Of these 140 (5. 6%) have died. Most patients died within the
first six hours of arrival in the health service and it is likely that more
deaths occurred among patients on their way to hospital. The first case in
the current outbreak was detected on 25 June 1997 in Nyatike Division.
Migori District, and then spread to Rachuonyo, Suba, Homa Bay and Kisumu
District of Nyuanza province and currently to Molo in Nakuru.
Following the recommendations issued by the Ministry of Health and WHO in a
joint meeting, the government allocated funds for the purchase of drugs and
for activities to monitor the situation and limit the spread of the
disease. The strategies aim at preventing deaths by improved early case
detection and case management in health care facilities. Health education
and surveillance through contact tracing is [being] implemented by
environmental health officers who also distribute oral rehydration salts in
the affected communities.
The Ministry of Health considers the situation unstable in all affected
five districts. The major contributing factors to this outbreak remain
poor sanitation, lack of safe water and socio-cultural factors.
