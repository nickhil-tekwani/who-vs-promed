Members of the public have been advised not to collect or eat any
shellfish, oysters and abalone on the West Coast of South Africa
(north of Cape Point) until further notice from the Department of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism. This comes after fisheries control
inspectors found dead perlemoen caught up in shallow waters at
Melkbosstrand, north of Cape Town, on Saturday [5 Apr 2008].

The department has received the results of tests carried out on
samples that were taken over the weekend and low levels of toxins of
Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) were detected in the abalone. The
department is continuously monitoring the situation.

"We continue to recommend that the public do not collect and/or eat
any shellfish, especially mussels, oysters and abalone, on the West
Coast (north of Cape Point) until further advised," says the department.

Marine and Coastal Management spokesperson Maryke Brand told BuaNews
that so far no incidences of people falling ill because of shellfish
have been reported. She warned that consumption of the affected
shellfish can be fatal especially when a doctor is not consulted on
time. "At the moment, we advised people to stop collecting shellfish
until we are certain that it is safe to do so," she said.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning is caused by harmful algal blooms of a
specific dinoflagellate, Aleandrium cantella, which occurs when toxic
phytoplankton that are typically taken up from the water by shellfish
such as mussels and oysters, then accumulate the algal toxins to
levels that are potentially dangerous to humans and other consumers.

The 1st symptoms of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) are a
tingling, stinging or burning sensation of the lips, tongue and
fingertips within 30 minutes of eating poisonous shellfish. Numbness
of the arms, legs and neck follows. If these symptoms are
experienced, a doctor should be consulted immediately.

Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin,
it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it
causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.

PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
on both the east and west coasts of the United States. Produced by
several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP
toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their
accumulation in filter-feeding shellfish, but they also move through
the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and
even birds and marine mammals.

_Alexandrium_ sp. is one of many members of this genera. Some members
may not be toxic. However, generally, the genera is found in costal
waters high in nitrogen content. These organisms produce a
neurotoxin, like many of the organisms capable of causing Paralytic
Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). The neurotoxin is considered fatal for
humans consuming contaminated shellfish and may be dangerous to
humans and animals who swim in waters that are "blooming" with the
organism. Ocean spray containing the organism may also cause
illnesses, including rashes and eye irritation in people. Some
species of this genera are capable of causing "red tide" that may be
visible for long distances along a coast line.

Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life.

Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from
affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide
poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for several days.

Previously, the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
Karenia was chosen in honor of Dr. Karen Steidinger, a prominent red
tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St.
Petersburg, Florida. - Mod.TG]
