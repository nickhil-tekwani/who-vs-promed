Background data on trichinellosis in Canada
-------------------------------------------
Trichinellosis was first reported in Canada during the 1870s. The incidence
in the North West and Yukon territories (11 per 100 000 during the 1980s)
is 100-fold that of other regions. The first walrus-related outbreak was
reported in 1982. Such outbreaks have been reported as far south as
Inukjuak (Hudson Bay) to as far north as Saluit, notably in Nunavik
(northern Quebec), and Nunavut.
From 1982 to 1999, 11 outbreaks (86 cases) were reported among the Inuit:
9 from walrus meat, one from arctic fox (_Alpoex lagopus_) meat, and one
from polar bear meat. From 1980 to 1999, the incidence of reported cases in
Canada varied from 0 to 61 per year. No infested swine were identified
through national surveillance during 1985 to 1990 (with the exception of an
isolated outbreak in Nova Scotia). No infested wild boar were identified in
1994; 0 infested swine in 1997.
Prevalence surveys:
24-61 per cent of polar bear (_Ursus maritimus_); 1-4 per cent of walrus
(_Odobenus rosmarus_); 33 per cent of red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_) and
wolves (_Canis lupus_); up to 36 per cent of arctic foxes (_Alopex lagopus_).
Arctic outbreaks are ascribed to _Trichinella nativa_ (more resistant to
freezing than _T. spiralis_).
Notable outbreaks:
1974 - an outbreak (29 cases, 2 fatal) was caused by infested bear meat.
1987 - an outbreak (42 cases) related to walrus meat was reported in the
arctic region [note, not included in official figures above].
1993 - an outbreak of 538 cases in France was traced to the meat of a
single horse imported from Canada.
1993 - an outbreak (24 cases) in Ontario was caused by tainted wild boar meat.
1997 - outbreaks (29 cases and 7 cases) were reported among the Inuit.
1999 - an outbreak (62 cases) related to walrus meat was reported among
Inuit on the east coast of Baffin Island (Arctic region) -- the
northernmost outbreak to date.
2000 - an outbreak (78 cases) of _T. nativa_ infection in Saskatchewan
followed consumption of bear meat.
2005 - an outbreak (9 cases) of _T. nativa_ infection among French hunters
in Quebec was caused by contaminated bear meat. Eight additional cases were
reported among persons in France who shared imported meat.
