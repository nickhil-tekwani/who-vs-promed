[1] Masks

As the highly contagious omicron coronavirus variant continues to spread, some experts say it's past time to reconsider your face mask options -- especially if you're still wearing the cloth variety.

"Cloth masks are little more than facial decorations. There's no place for them in light of omicron," said CNN Medical Analyst Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, on CNN Newsroom Tuesday [21 Dec 2021].

"This is what scientists and public health officials have been saying for months, many months, in fact," Wen added in a separate phone interview.

"We need to be wearing at least a 3-ply surgical mask," she said, which is also known as a disposable mask and can be found at most drugstores and some grocery and retail stores. "You can wear a cloth mask on top of that, but do not just wear a cloth mask alone."

Ideally, in crowded places, "you should be wearing a KN95 or N95 mask," which can be as inexpensive as a few dollars each, Wen added. By having a better fit and certain materials -- such as polypropylene fibers -- acting as both mechanical and electrostatic barriers, these masks better prevent tiny particles from getting into your nose or mouth and must be fitted to your face to function properly.

Changing guidance
-----------------
During the 1st several months of the pandemic, health experts discouraged the general public from buying N95 masks, since medical professionals were facing a shortage of personal protection equipment. But it has "been many months since supply of N95s (has been) an issue," Wen said.

Yet the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's most recent guidance on selecting, properly wearing, cleaning, and storing face masks recommended people avoid N95 masks and instead choose masks with 2 or more layers of washable, breathable fabric -- which Wen called "a major mistake."

"If we're going to go as far as to say that masks are required -- when we don't come from a mask-wearing culture and people don't like wearing masks -- at least recommend that they wear the most effective mask," Wen said.

Other countries, including Germany and Austria, have "switched their standard to say that a face covering in public must be at least a medical-grade surgical mask" in certain settings, she added. CNN reached out to the CDC about its recommendations regarding N95s and cloth masks and is still awaiting comment.

Another factor driving change in mask recommendations is a better understanding of COVID-19 and how it spreads, said Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. "It's taken longer for people to appreciate the nature of airborne infection -- that this isn't necessarily a hybrid infection, say with influenza, where it can both be spread by droplets, inhaled a little bit, on surfaces and infect that way," he said. "It appears ... the primary driver of (coronavirus) infection is shared air."

Cloth masks -- encouraged earlier in the pandemic -- can filter large droplets, while more effective masks, such as N95s, can filter both large droplets and the smaller aerosols or particles potentially laden with airborne virus if infected people are present, Bromage said. A cloth face covering also has 75% inward and outward leakage, which the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists defines as the "percentage of particles entering the facepiece" and the "percentage of particles exhaled by a source exiting the facepiece," respectively.

Properly fitted N95 respirators that are approved by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health can filter up to 95% of particles in the air, according to the CDC. Surgical or disposable masks are around 5%-10% less effective than N95 respirators, Bromage said, depending on their ASTM International categorization -- with types 1, 2, and 3 ranking just surgical masks from least to most effective.

Why the omicron variant has been so successful at quickly infecting many people is "unknown at the moment," but it only underscores the role quality masks can play, Bromage said.

"If it is less virus needed, or if it is a person who's infected is putting more virus out, then the role of a mask in this is if we can cut down the amount that you're actually breathing in, you get more time," he added. "If you needed 1000 viral particles to infect you and you're wearing something that cuts 50% of things down, it's now going to take twice as long to get to that 1000. If you're wearing one that is 90% efficient, it's going to take at least 10 times as long before you get infected when you're around somebody (who is infected)."

"We need to be promoting better high-quality masks everywhere because right now a single-layer cloth mask just isn't cutting it against omicron," said former US Surgeon General Dr Jerome Adams Thursday [23 Dec 2021] on CNN's AC360. "We need more testing. We need better masking. That's how we get through this."

Swapping out your cloth masks
-----------------------------
The National Institute for Occupational Health & Safety [NIOSH] has a list of approved N95 respirators, which can be found at some home improvement stores, retailers, and drugstores. These masks should have a cup, flat fold, or duckbill shape; 2 straps that go around your head; an adjustable wire nose bridge; and appropriate markings indicating NIOSH approval, the CDC says.

The agency also has resources for determining whether an N95 respirator is counterfeit, and for properly putting it on, taking it off, and performing a respirator seal check.

The difference between N95 and KN95 respirators is where the mask is certified, according to Oklahoma's state health department. The US certifies N95s, while China approves KN95s. About 60% of KN95 respirators in the US are counterfeit and don't meet NIOSH requirements, the CDC says. The CDC has a list of signs a KN95 respirator hasn't been approved by NIOSH.

"If they're made to the standard and certified by the appropriate boards in their country like NIOSH here, they all do basically the same thing," Bromage said. "But there is a ton of knockoffs that are not certified in the KN95 side of things, that may meet the standards but they're not certified to meet it. And there are others that clearly don't."

These experts' recommendation to wear better masks isn't a suggestion to trash your cloth masks or go "maskless" when you don't have a medical-grade mask available.

In studies of various face masks, cloth masks with multiple layers and higher thread counts "have demonstrated superior performance compared to single layers of cloth with lower thread counts," but are still less effective than medical-grade masks, according to the CDC. Wearing a cloth mask over a medical procedure mask, as Wen suggested, can better protect you and others by improving fit and therefore filtration capacity, the CDC says.

"If all you have is a cloth mask, it's still better than nothing," Wen said. "But you are not well-protected, and you should know that you're not well-protected. And so if you're going to a crowded indoor setting and all you have is a cloth mask, don't go."

If you're unable to buy medical-grade masks for whatever reason, go to locations that are requiring masks and providing them for free -- such as some train stations, grocery stores, or businesses -- and ask for a surgical mask, Wen suggested.

[2] Booster dose
Date: Fri 24 Dec 2021
Source: Business Insider [edited]
https://www.businessinsider.com/how-long-does-booster-protection-omicron-covid-last-study-2021-12


Booster shots protect against symptomatic omicron infection for about 10 weeks, study finds -- which could mean more doses for some in 2022
- Booster protection against symptomatic COVID-19 caused by omicron lasts about 10 weeks, data shows.
- It may mean 4th doses in 2022 -- depending on whether protection holds against severe COVID-19.
- Immunocompromised Americans can already get an extra shot.

Booster protection against symptomatic illness caused by the omicron variant dropped by up to 25% within 10 weeks, new real-world data found -- though it's not yet clear whether everyone may need further doses in 2022 [https://www.businessinsider.com/early-research-shows-omicrons-impact-on-covid-19-shots-2021-12].

The UK Health Security Agency [UKHSA] said protection against symptomatic COVID-19 caused by the variant dropped from 70% to 45% after a Pfizer booster for those initially vaccinated with the shot developed by Pfizer with BioNTech.

In the same analysis published on Thursday [23 Nov 2021], the agency found the effectiveness of Moderna's booster paired with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine held at 70% to 75% for up to 9 weeks, though not many people in the study received this regimen, which could affect the accuracy of the finding [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1043807/technical-briefing-33.pdf].

For those fully vaccinated with AstraZeneca's vaccine, booster effectiveness dropped from 60% to 35% with a Pfizer booster and to 45% with a Moderna booster after 10 weeks, the UKHSA said.

Eric Topol, the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, tweeted on Thursday [24 Nov] that the UK findings were a "replication" of what had been seen in Israel. [https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1474137700986863638]

On Wednesday [22 Nov 2021], Israel became the 1st country to announce 4th doses to try to bolster immunity against omicron for those most susceptible to COVID-19, including people older than 60 and health workers.

But other countries, such as the UK, are holding tight for more data on how well existing regimens work and the safety and effectiveness of additional doses.

In the US, most immunocompromised people can already get a 4th dose from 6 months after the 3rd. Those who got Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine initially aren't recommended more than 2 doses, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html#considerations-covid19-vax-immunocopromised].

Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunization at UKHSA, told The Independent that the UK wouldn't rush into changing its policy on vaccination until it had clarity on whether the protection against severe disease was affected by omicron [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/omicron-protection-booster-delta-vaccine-b1981576.html].

The agency said it would be a few weeks before booster protection against severe COVID-19 caused by omicron could be estimated because there hadn't been many people getting sick from it. "However, based on experience with previous variants, this is likely to be substantially higher than the estimates against symptomatic disease," it said.

Adam Finn, a member of the group of experts who advise the UK government, told LBC radio on Friday [24 Dec 221] that the committee would provide recommendations "at some point in the New Year [2022]"

"We do need to see how things go through this wave and beyond. I think there may well be people who received their boosters early who are in the older, more vulnerable age groups who may need a further jab -- that has not been decided yet," he said.

To get to the figures, the UK researchers compared the vaccination rates in people who had tested positive for omicron on a lab test with those who tested negative between [27 Nov 2021] -- when the 1st omicron cases were detected in the UK -- and [17 Dec 2021]. People with foreign travel were excluded from the analysis.

In the meantime, the experts said the priority to tackle omicron was still to vaccinate people who weren't vaccinated and get boosters into as many people as possible.

[3] Voice problems (dysphonia)
Date: Wed 22 Dec 2021
Source: Fox News [edited]
https://www.foxnews.com/health/residual-voice-problems-found-post-covid-patients


After the initial phase of COVID-19, some patients are experiencing problems with their voice, health experts told Fox News. These voice issues include hoarseness, quality of voice, and a condition called vocal fatigue, which can have an impact on a person's quality of life, speech professionals told Fox News.

"If a patient is feeling fatigued after using their voice, they may tend to not want to communicate as often as usual. They may withdraw from social activities as speaking becomes taxing and no longer pleasurable. A patient may not be able to perform their regular duties in their workplace as speaking is too difficult," Catherine Crowley, PhD, CCC-SLP, who is the Chair of the Communication Sciences and Disorders School of Health Professions and Nursing at LIU Post in Brookville, NY, told Fox News during an interview.

Crowley, who is a speech pathologist and also an assistant Professor at LIU -Post, told Fox News that some patients are presenting with complaints of vocal fatigue and difficulty speaking (dysphonia), following a COVID-19 infection.

According to health experts, vocal fatigue symptoms may include the feeling of a raspy, strained, or breathy quality in a patient's voice. Some post-COVID patients may also complain of discomfort when speaking and experience a loss of range or pitch and breaks in their voice, speech pathologists explained to Fox News.

Crowley also commented on a recently published report in the Journal of Voice where a group of Italian researchers looked at 160 individuals who were infected with COVID-19. The researchers found that nearly 44 percent of the patients presented with self-evaluated mild to moderate dysphonia following COVID-19 despite not requiring hospitalization. The study also found that nearly 27 percent of those individuals reported vocal fatigue.

Crowley was not part of the study but told Fox News, "Keep in mind that these patients did not require intubation for the treatment of COVID-19. It would be assumed that you may see a higher prevalence of dysphonia following intubation with a correlation between duration of intubation and severity of the dysphonia."

Crowley explained to Fox News that if a patient was incubated during their treatment of COVID-19, they may run the risk of dysphonia because the intubation may affect the vocal folds.

"Endotracheal intubation may result in compromised vocal fold closure, which in turn would result in a dysphonia. It is also known that prolonged intubation can result in a swallowing disorder called, dysphagia; which has also been found to be a risk factor of COVID-19," Crowley told Fox News.

Crowley also warned that vocal fatigue can occur in individuals recovering from COVID-19 infections who were not intubated. She told Fox News that this might occur because of compromised respiratory status, overall fatigue, and other underlying medical issues that occur after being infected with the novel coronavirus.

Dr Ashutosh Kacker is a professor of clinical otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian Hospital-Cornell campus in New York City. Kacker told Fox News that "Voice changes can happen in patients with COVID-19 which include inflammation of the voice box from the virus itself and coughing, viral injury to the vagus nerve (the nerve which controls the voice box), and as a consequence of being on a ventilator with a breathing tube which can potentially damage the vocal cords or from a tracheotomy (surgical airway)."

Kacker is hopeful that Post COVID-19 infection voice issues will be less prevalent as we learn more about this virus. "The more serious voice issues were more common in the initial waves of COVID-19 and are less common now as we have understood the management of serious COVID-19 better." The ENT (ear, nose, and throat specialist) specialist told Fox News that laryngitis is still the more common presentation and typically gets better in most patients within the 10-14-day period.

However, for the population of patients that do experience voice issues post COVID-19, speech pathologists have now incorporated ways to treat patients with vocal fatigue and dysphonia.

"Sometimes vocal fatigue is related to excessive laryngeal tension and poor breathing mechanics," Crowley explained to Fox News and added, "Sometimes therapy will focus on laryngeal muscle relaxation exercises. Diaphragmatic breathing patterns may also be targeted in therapy."

The LIU professor told Fox News that patients with dysphonia or vocal fatigue should maintain adequate vocal hygiene and said this may include eliminating yelling or whispering, strong hydration, and avoiding or minimizing the use of caffeine, alcohol, and smoking. Crowley is currently engaged in a study at LIU-Post addressing vocal fatigue in post-COVID-19 patients.

Health experts recommend that anyone experiencing voice issues should seek an examination by an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT) to evaluate their vocal cords.

[Mt Sinai researchers are studying the mechanism behind the voice problems. "Until now, the lower respiratory tract was thought to be the primary target for COVID-19 -- studies have shown the virus enters the cells by attaching to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) -- but the upper airway and lower respiratory tract are inextricably linked. The cells being attacked are also present in the upper respiratory tract.

"While post-mortem studies of COVID-19 patients have focused primarily on the lower respiratory tract, physicians are beginning to study tissue samples in the upper airway taken from tracheal resections. Additional studies are also looking at intubation tube size and its effect on post-COVID-19 complications."

[In the past 24 hours, 11 countries including France (104 611), Italy (54 761), the USA (40 458), Germany (17 248), Russia (24 946), Turkey (20 470), Viet Nam (15 586), South Africa (14 828), Ireland (13 765), the Netherlands (12 564), and Poland (10 789), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 4082 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 23 Dec 2021 to late 24 Dec 2021). Overall case reporting was lower, possibly on account of the Christmas and holiday season.

A total of 53 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 53 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 1 from the South East Asia region, and 5 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 18.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 36.1 % increase in daily reported cases and 12.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 279.83 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.41 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
