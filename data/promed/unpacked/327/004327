The Norwegian Food Safety Authority cancels the general advice to limit close contact between dogs. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Veterinary Institute now receive few reports of dogs with bloody diarrhea from veterinarians. It is also clear that not all cases of illness can be linked to each other.

Many of the reported cases are from some counties in Eastern Norway, where the density of dogs is also high. The Veterinary Institute and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority believe that more dogs in this area would become ill if this had been an illness that effectively infected dogs. This is true even if dog owners have complied with the Food Safety Authority's advice for now. The information we received also shows that in most cases where one sick dog lives with other dogs, only one dog has become ill.

The Veterinary Institute believes it is unlikely that there is one specific common denominator among all the registered cases of dogs with bloody diarrhea. It is emphasized that the development of disease is probably what is called multifactorial, which means that the development of the disease is due to several coinciding factors. Some of the cases may also have other causes and may not be part of what we perceive as an outbreak.

So far, the bacterium _Providencia alcalifaciens_ has been detected in about 50 of the dogs who have fallen ill with bloody diarrhea. The bacterium has also been detected in some healthy dogs, but in smaller quantities.

Some of the samples from sick dogs are examined further to see if there is a relationship between the bacterial strains, i.e., whether the _Providencia_ bacteria are almost identical. This is done using a method called whole-genome sequencing.

The Veterinary Institute and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority continue to work on studies of the pathogenic properties of the bacteria and systematically search for possible sources.

In parallel with this, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority reviews and follows up the information from the ongoing survey to see if there are common features such as age, breed, feeding, contact with other dogs, areas and the like.

Some dog owners with sick or dead dogs have taken care of samples of what the dog has eaten for the past 14 days. These can still be saved so that you can take samples of them if necessary. Feed is one of many possibilities that are still being investigated.

[The number and locations of the dead dogs, since the previous update of 24 Sep 2019 (20190924.6692112), have not changed. - Mod.AS]

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has received information about a dog that died in Sweden, after traveling in Norway. The dog was neither Norwegian nor Swedish and died due to chronic illness. It has not been linked to the cases in Norway [see comment].

[A Swedish media source (GT - Western Sweden Evening) reported on Thu 26 Sep 2019 that among the dead dogs in Norway there was one native to Sweden, which had died with similar symptoms. The case was reported by a Swedish veterinarian, who said that the dog had visited Norway, returned home and then suffered bloody diarrhea and died. However, this case has eventually been found by Norway's Food Safety Authority as not linked to the cases in Norway and that the dog suffered a chronic illness. GT presented the reassuring view of the Swedish veterinary establishment, as expressed by Karl Stahl, a state epidemiologist at the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA): "We have seen that the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has written about a case of a dog resident in Sweden. That information does not change our assessment of the risk for Swedish dogs. The assessment remains that the situation described in Norway does not entail an increased risk of disease outbreaks in Swedish dogs" (https://www.expressen.se/gt/farre-nya-fall-av-norsk-hundsjuka/).

ProMED-mail will continue following the event, which seems to have peaked, anticipating its termination followed by a summary of the findings and, if possible, conclusions. - Mod.AS
