Flora Foods of Pompano Beach, Florida, is recalling its 25 oz. jars
of "Cerignola Olives" (UPC 0-20038-00693-5) because they have the
potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a
bacterium that can cause life-threatening illness or death. Consumers
are warned not to use the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.
Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the
following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double vision, and
[difficulty] speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing,
weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension, and constipation may
also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should
seek immediate medical attention.
The recalled "Cerignola" olives were distributed in Florida, Georgia,
and upstate New York in retail stores. The product comes in a 25 oz.
clear glass jar with "LOT #G080" stamped on the label.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing found
that the product had been underprocessed. Distribution of the product
has been suspended as FDA and the company continue their
investigation as to the source of the problem.
Consumers who have purchased 25 oz. jars of "Cerignola" olives are
urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.
Consumers with questions may contact the company at 954-785-3100.

[The Bella di Cerignola (or commonly just "Cerignola") olive is
cultivated in the Apulia region in the southeastern corner of Italy,
at the 'heel of the boot', and is cured in brine and vinegar. Its
crunchy texture and mild flavor make it an excellent choice for an
appetizer or snack.
Similar recalls occurred with the same brand of olives in November
2005
<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/corpaffr/recarapp/2005/20051108e.shtml>,
and in December 2006 (ProMED-mail posting Botulism, olives - Canada
(ON) ex Italy: recall 20061205.3430).
Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food. - Mod.LL]
