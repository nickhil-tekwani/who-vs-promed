Bacterial rot of lettuce caused by _Pseudomonas cichorii_ in Turkey

for publication 3 Jun 2003.
In the winter of 2002, a severe disease indicating bacterial rot was
observed on leaves of lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_ cv. Tasna) grown in 4
commercial fields in the province of Mersin (Tarsus) in the eastern
Mediterranean region of Turkey. Disease incidence was estimated at 25-30
percent.
Initial symptoms were small (1-2 mm in diameter), shiny, dark brown spots
scattered on the blades, petioles, and particularly along the veins of
leaves underneath the second or third head leaves. Numerous lesions
enlarged and coalesced, causing moist, greenish or yellowish to black
areas, but no soft rot was observed on the infected plants in advanced
stages of the disease. These symptoms were consistent with those of
bacterial rot described by Hikichi et al. (1996).
A fluorescent, gram-negative bacterium was consistently isolated from
diseased tissues onto King's B medium (King et al., 1954). 8 representative
strains isolated were oxidase, catalase, levan, and pectolytic positive,
and arginine dihydrolase negative. They all produced positive
hypersensitive reactions on tobacco (_Nicotiana tabacum_ cv. Samsun). Fatty
acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis identified the strains as _Pseudomonas
cichorii_ (Swingle) Stapp with similarity indices ranging from 86 to 98
percent (Janse et al., 1992).
Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on 5-week-old lettuce (cv.
Tasna) and tomato (cv. H-2274) plants sprayed with bacterial suspensions
containing 100 million CFU/ml of sterile water. Inoculated and
sterile-water-sprayed control plants were maintained in a growth chamber
for 8 days at 25 deg C and 70 percent [humidity?]. Lesions similar to those
observed in the field developed on the inoculated plants within 5-7 days.
No symptoms developed on control plants. The bacterium was reisolated from
inoculated plants and identified as _P. cichorii_.
This is the first report of the occurrence and outbreak of a bacterial rot
disease caused by this bacterium on lettuce grown in Turkey. It is not
proven, but is speculated that contaminated seeds and/or transplants may
have been the source of introduction of the pathogen to this region.

[According to plant pathologists at the University of Massachusetts,
several syndromes (bacterial leaf spot, bud blight, and stem canker, ) are
caused by _Pseudomonas cichorii_. The bacterium has a wide geographic
distribution and, in addition to lettuce, infects cabbage, clover, tomato,
tobacco, celery, cauliflower, and various foliage plants. The disease in
lettuce is particularly damaging at higher elevations in Japan. - Mod.DH]
