A new exotic disease of rice was confirmed by the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA). It is black smut (_Tilletia horrida_) and was found in 5 farms in the department of Sucre. It has also been found in some rice mills in other departments, including Cesar, Meta, Huila and Tolima. This means that the disease has already spread throughout the country.

According to Carlos Alberto Soto, ICA, this disease was not present in the country before, and, although its route of entry is unknown, it is likely to have entered with rice seed smuggled into the country. "The ICA is carrying out surveys to determine the actual distribution of the pathogen and the damage to rice producing areas in Colombia," he said.

The pathogen had already been declared a regulated pest subject to official surveillance.

[Black smut (also called kernel smut or bunt) of rice is caused by the fungus _Tilletia barclayana_ (synonym _T. horrida_). It is present in many rice growing areas. The fungus causes the endosperm of the rice grain to be replaced partially or completely by a black mass of spores. Up to 15 percent of the kernels may be infected on highly susceptible varieties, and yield losses of up to 25 percent have been reported when infected seed was used.

Symptoms usually become apparent at crop maturity when spores push through the glumes and may swell from the moisture of overnight dew. Spores may settle on other plant parts forming a characteristic black covering. Spores are spread with infected grain and plant material and by wind, infecting ovaries of flowers. They survive in the soil between crops and remain viable in stored grain for up to 3 years. They also survive passing through digestive tracts of domestic animals. Disease management includes preventative seed treatment, use of crop varieties with reduced susceptibility, and cultural techniques such as crop rotation and pathogen exclusion.

Related _Tilletia_ species cause karnal and dwarf bunt diseases of wheat; additional species occur on non-economic grass hosts. Both the rice and wheat pathogens are considered a quarantine risk as contaminants of harvested grain by many countries.

Claims of black smut contaminations of rice shipments to Colombia have led to trade disputes earlier, for example with Guyana and the US in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20090402.1268). Since the pathogen is already widely distributed in the country, it appears likely that it has been present for at least several years and is well established by now.
