[A female patient is feeling better, thank you, considering her brush with
bubonic plague. And she's learned a lesson: Don't touch wobbly mice. "Those
little drunken, wobbly mice would get into the house and you could get right
up to them and pick them up by their tails and drop them in the toilet," she
said Tuesday. "And they would die real fast. We found six of them over the
past six months," [she said from her St. Joseph Hospital bed.
[The woman, 43, who lives just north of Albuquerque, was confirmed late
Monday as suffering from the disease -- the first human plague case of the
year in New Mexico.
"She's in fine condition," said Dr. David Keller, chief of the infectious
disease epidemiology program at the state Department of Health. Keller said
the department is trying to determine how [she got the plague. The patient
found the last wobbly mouse around Christmas. "I actually saw it and it ran
behind a cabinet. Then one of the dogs was scratching at something, and the
mouse had died at the foot of the pedestal table," she said. [The woman
used a paper towel to pick up the mouse and tossed it in the garbage, then
washed her hands with antibacterial soap. She became ill Friday. "I noticed
that I had a swollen lymph node, then it quickly went downhill from there.
The chills. Lower back pain like you can get with the flu," she said. On
Saturday, she went to see a doctor, who immediately ordered her hospitalized.
Plague is typically thought to be a summertime disease, but can strike
year-round. The last human plague death in the state was in 1994 an
8-year-old northern New Mexico boy. Bubonic plague is a bacterial disease,
generally transmitted to humans from the bites of fleas infected by dead or
dying rodents. Most people lapse into illness within seven days after
exposure. Symptoms include chills and fever; painful, swollen lymph nodes in
the groin, armpit or neck; and sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea.
The state Department of Health recommends that pets and people keep away
from sick or dead rodents, keep children from playing near rodent nests or
burrows and clean areas near houses where rodents could live. [The woman
said construction is still being done on her house, so it's easy for mice
and other critters to get in. But she won't ever again try to get rid of
rodents on her own. "The state is coming out," she said. "I think they're
going to exterminate around the house."

[The report indicates that the family had been finding dead and "wobbly"
mice with poor swimming ability over a six months period, that is from the
normal summer season. And that the house was being remodelled in some major
but drawn out manner, indicates that there was probably more than adequate
rodent harborage under and around the house. One's only question is then
why did it take until Christmas for the _Yersinia_ to spread from the
rodents to the human occupants. Possibly, because of colder weather
bringing even more mice to join the pre-existing and infected domestic
population. - MHJ
