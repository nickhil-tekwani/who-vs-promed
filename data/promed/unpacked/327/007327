[2] Case control study
Date: Wed 4 Nov 2015
From: Helen Branswell <helen.branswell@statnews.com> [edited]


A case control study is one of the 1st tools disease detectives reach for when they need to solve a new mystery. These studies lay the groundwork for understanding a new malady and identifying what is making people sick when outbreaks occur.

And yet, inexplicably, there has never been a case control study published about Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, a disease that 1st cropped up more than 3 years ago, until now, that is. The 1st MERS case control study has finally been published.

Researchers from Saudi Arabia, aided by scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], reported this week that people who had direct and indirect contact with camels were more likely to develop the often-fatal lung disease than people who didn't have contact with dromedaries.

Milking a camel appeared to increase a person's risk of getting sick, according to the study, which will be published in the January [2016] issue of the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. CDC posted it online on Tue [3 Nov 2015].

But drinking unpasteurized camel milk or camel urine -- believed to have medicinal qualities by some in the Middle East -- did not seem to increase the risk of catching MERS, at least for people in this study. The study, however, was small and in all likelihood not the final word on MERS risks.

The researchers studied 30 people they were confident were "primary" cases, people who had not contracted MERS from another person but caught it instead from an animal or environmental source. The goal was to determine the source.

Here's how it was done: researchers asked people who caught MERS scads [lots] of questions, what they did, where they went, what they ate, what kind of animal contact they had. The same questions were put to "controls", people of similar ages, health-status and who lived near the cases, but who did not contract MERS.

If cases and controls ate dates, dates weren't a problem. But if cases kept camels as pets and controls did not, that's a clue.

Of the 30 cases in the study, 17 were either dead or too sick to speak, so the researchers interviewed a family member instead. The researchers acknowledge that might affect the reliability of the information they were able to collect on more than half of their cases.

When case control studies are conducted at the start of an outbreak, they generally illuminate facts that have not yet come into view. In the case of this study, most of the clues it provides have already been unearthed through other means.

Why the study wasn't conducted earlier is not clear. The World Health Organization and others urged, pleaded, cajoled, and eventually criticized MERS-affected countries -- especially Saudi Arabia, which has reported more than 85 per cent of MERS cases -- for not doing this fundamental research.

International scientists offered assistance. WHO provided a template Saudi researchers could follow. And the community of public health experts concerned about MERS waited and waited.

This likely isn't the study they would have hoped for. A larger study involving cases from Qatar, Jordan, and other countries that record MERS cases would have been more helpful, said Peter Ben Embarek, WHO's technical lead for MERS. Likewise, at this point, more specific questions about camel interactions would have been useful, he suggested. "We need a better understanding," he said.

Still, it's a start. And Ben Embarek said it may help quiet the chorus of camel defenders who refuse to believe these animals -- much beloved on the Arabian Peninsula -- are playing a role in the spread of MERS.

Abstract
"Risk factors for primary Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) illness in humans are incompletely understood. We identified all primary MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during March-November 2014 by excluding those with history of exposure to other cases of MERS-CoV or acute respiratory illness of unknown cause or exposure to healthcare settings within 14 days before illness onset. Using a case-control design, we assessed differences in underlying medical conditions and environmental exposures among primary case-patients and 2-4 controls matched by age, sex, and neighborhood. Using multivariable analysis, we found that direct exposure to dromedary camels during the 2 weeks before illness onset, as well as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and smoking, were each independently associated with MERS-CoV illness. Further investigation is needed to better understand animal-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV."

Discussion
"By carefully identifying persons with primary MERS-CoV infections and systematically comparing their characteristics to age- and sex-matched neighborhood controls, our study supports a link between exposure to dromedaries and human MERS-CoV illness, as well as host risk factors (that is, diabetes, heart disease, and smoking). Exposure to bats, goats, horses, sheep, or the products of these animals were not associated with MERS CoV illness in our study. The role of an animal reservoir in the transmission of MERS-CoV to humans has been actively considered since the first reported cases in 2012. Our investigation was designed to broadly assess the possible routes and modes of transmission of MERS-CoV and to determine the risk associated with exposure to different animal species and general environmental factors.

"In our study, direct contact with dromedaries in the 2 weeks before illness onset was associated with MERS-CoV illness. The proportions reporting direct contact with dromedaries was limited among both case-patients and controls (33 per cent vs. 15 per cent). Among specific direct exposures that we investigated, only milking dromedaries was significantly associated with illness. However, we noted a significant association when considering together all reported activities that involve direct dromedary exposure. When we controlled for underlying conditions, direct exposure to dromedaries (whether in the previous 2 weeks or in the previous 6 months) remained an independent risk factor for MERS-CoV illness. Additionally, living in the same household with persons who reported working on or visiting a farm where dromedaries were kept was a risk factor for illness; although the numbers were small, the highest risks were associated with other relatives and domestic helpers. Indirect contact with dromedaries might explain primary MERS-CoV illness in case-patients without direct dromedary contact and should be further explored. Other potential explanations of MERS-CoV illness in primary case-patients who did not have direct contact with dromedaries include unrecognized community exposure to patients with mild or subclinical MERS-CoV infection or exposure to other sources of primary MERS-CoV infection not ascertained in our study. A recent nationwide serosurvey from Saudi Arabia estimated that over 44 000 persons might be seropositive for MERS-CoV and might be the source of infection to patients with confirmed primary MERS-CoV illness but with no dromedary exposure (8). Although we found that direct and indirect dromedary exposure were significantly associated with MERS-CoV illness, our study had limited power to detect specific behaviors or practices associated with illness. Future studies should be designed to further explore this association.

"Case-patients in our study were significantly more likely than controls to report diabetes; this finding provides epidemiologic evidence of diabetes as a risk factor for MERS-CoV illness. Smoking and heart disease were also significantly associated with MERS-CoV illness. Of note was the overwhelming male preponderance in our study; only 1 of the 30 case-patients with primary infection was female. The fact that men in Saudi Arabia are much more likely than women to have contact with dromedaries might explain this observation. Previous studies have reported some male preponderance, but those findings were not as striking as our results, probably because MERS-CoV infections in most patients in other studies were healthcare associated and transmitted from human to human (2,4).

"Our study is subject to several limitations. 1st, the delay between illness and interview might have affected recall among study participants. 2nd, our study was a nationwide investigation that covered a large area, and interviews were conducted by different teams at different times. However, all interviewers received training designed to limit interview variability. 3rd, MERS-CoV is a highly lethal disease, and 17 of the 30 case-patients in our study were interviewed by proxy (that is, information was collected from a family member), which might have affected the reliability of the exposure information collected. 4th, choosing neighborhood controls could have resulted in an underestimation of certain risk factors because of possible similarities between case-patients and controls. However, the study still identified an association with dromedary exposure. 5th, the occurrence of primary MERS-CoV cases is a relatively rare event, limiting the number of cases available for inclusion in our study and the power to detect differences from controls. We applied stringent criteria for enrollment and attempted to exclude persons who might have acquired infection through human-to-human transmission, but the possibility of misclassification remains. However, inadvertent inclusion of secondary cases is likely to mean that the true risk associated with dromedary exposure was higher than we estimated. 6th, we did not investigate dromedary husbandry practices or ascertain whether dromedaries were infected with MERS-CoV. Additionally, the surveillance system in place in Saudi Arabia might be more likely to detect persons severely affected by MERS-CoV, who also might be more likely to have underlying conditions. This fact might have overstated the role of underlying conditions as a risk factor for disease. Finally, as in any study where a large number of parameters are tested, the expected type 1 error rate is 5 percent; therefore, one could anticipate that 1 in 20 significant results would incorrectly reject the null hypothesis.

"In conclusion, our findings represent an important initial step in understanding the risk factors for MERS-CoV infection, including zoonotic transmission. Control of MERS-CoV ultimately depends on the interruption of transmission to prevent primary MERS-CoV cases. Future longitudinal studies to assess specific human-dromedary interactions are needed to inform preventive measures."

This is a welcome study that identifies camels as a major risk factor for contracting MERS-CoV. These authors found no relationship of disease to exposure to bats, but the bat connection is nicely reviewed by Ian Mackay in the VDU [Virology Down Under] blog from Mon 2 Nov 2015 http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com/2015/11/mers-in-batswhat-have-we-actually-found.html. - Mod.LK
