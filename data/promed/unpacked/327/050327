Health Minister Datuk Seri S Subramaniam said 753 suspected leptospirosis infections with 126 confirmed cases were recorded since 1 Jan 2015 in the flood-hit states. He said there are also increases in other diseases such as acute gastroenteritis, other diarrheal diseases and upper respiratory tract infections among flood victims. Subramaniam also said that there are 20 confirmed melioidosis cases recorded at the flood affected places.

"We are increasing our public education and awareness, and public hygiene campaigns so that they (flood victims) drink only boiled water and eat well-cooked food.

"We want them to also take precautionary measures such as wearing boots and gloves when cleaning their premises," he told a press conference at the ministry [in Putrajaya].

Subramaniam said the ministry will continue to monitor the affected areas to prevent the diseases from spreading further.

The flooding in Malaysia occurred primarily in the [peninsular] northeastern states of Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang. Both leptospirosis and melioidosis occur more often in times of flooding. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis, however, melioidosis' reservoir is the soil.

Leptospirosis may occur sporadically or as large outbreaks during periods of flooding. Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by one of the many pathogenic serotypes of the spirochete _Leptospira_. It is transmitted to humans by exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes to water or wet soil (such as after flooding due to heavy rainfall) that has been contaminated by urine from asymptomatic, chronically infected animals, especially rodents. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris can provide a suitable habitat for rat infestation in
urban settings.

As a rule leptospirosis victims experience severe headaches and flu-like symptoms but the severe form, which is known as Weil's disease, causes jaundice and liver damage, and can be fatal, but it usually only affects 10 percent of leptospirosis victims. Leptospirosis is also known as canicola fever, canefield fever, Nanukayami fever, and 7-day fever. It is a bacterial disease that affects humans and a wide range of animals, including mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles but is relatively rare in humans. The infection is usually transmitted to humans when fresh water that has been contaminated by animal urine comes into contact with unhealed breaks in the skin, eyes, or with the mucous membranes.

It is most commonly carried by rats, mice, and voles but a wide range of other mammals including dogs, deer, rabbits, hedgehogs, cows, sheep, and even certain marine mammals are also able to carry and transmit the disease; dogs may pick it up by licking the urine of an infected animal from grass or soil, or drinking from an infected puddle. The infective bacteria are likely to be found on muddy riverbanks, ditches, gulleys, and muddy livestock rearing areas, which wild or farm mammals regularly traverse.

The cause of melioidosis, _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, exists as an environmental saprophyte living in soil and surface water in endemic areas (South East Asia and northern, tropical Australia), particularly in rice paddies. In endemic countries, the organism exists primarily in focal areas and is not equally distributed throughout the landscape. Sporadic cases have been reported to have been acquired in parts of Africa and the Americas. The organism may exist in a viable, non-cultivable state in the environment, interacting with other organisms, particularly protozoa, which might explain its adaptation to an intracellular niche. 2 outbreaks in Australia have also implicated potable water supplies rather than surface water as a potential source of the infection.

Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in the endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition such as diabetes (commonest risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption. Kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease.

Melioidosis may present at any age, but peaks in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

The most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright, red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, the lung, the liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80 to 95 per cent. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40 to 50 percent. - Mod.LL]
