At least 65 deaths have been reported in Yemen's western coastal
province of Hodeidah. The disease is thought to be chikungunya, though
some medical officers dispute it. Symptoms of chikungunya include
kidney failure, high temperature, diarrhea and vomiting [This is
inaccurate. The US CDC states that, "chikungunya virus infection can
cause a debilitating illness, most often characterized by fever,
headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash, and joint
pain. ... Additionally, some patients have reported incapacitating
joint pain, or arthritis which may last for weeks or months. ...
Fatalities related to chikungunya virus are rare."
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/Chikungunya/CH_SymptomsTreatment.html>).

Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh has formed a committee to
monitor the spread of the disease, and the country's authorities are
working hard to keep it in check.

Dr. Mohsen Al-Tobaiki, director of health in Jazan, said the Saudi
authorities have been following developments across the border. Dr.
Khaled Al-Mirghalani, spokesman for the Ministry of Health, and Dr.
Ziyad Mishmish, undersecretary for preventive medicine, were
unavailable for comment.

A number of medical and environmental experts in Jazan said there is
a possibility of the disease entering the kingdom through unregistered
migrants who do not carry health certificates proving they have taken
necessary vaccinations [No vaccine is available for chikungunya virus.
- Mod.TY]. They added that, at the moment, the border provinces in the
south of the kingdom are free from the disease.

According to Yemeni media, people in the Hodeidah area were shocked
at the loss of life. Arafat Maki, a local journalist who contracted
the illness, said the disease has caused panic in the area.

"Lots of people are thought to have died. The health facilities in
Hodeidah and hospitals are working overtime to cope with the influx of
patients," he said. The disease is locally known as Al-Mukarfess.

Dr. Abdul Hakim Al-Khohlaini, manager of the epidemiological
surveillance department at the Yemeni Ministry of Health, said that
samples sent to Cairo for tests showed that the disease is
chikungunya. He added that local doctors have also found other
diseases in the area. "45 per cent of the cases are chikungunya, 10
percent malaria, and the rest dengue fever," he said.

According to Al-Khohlaini, 61 people have died so far. "Some of the
dead are very old, and most of the cases haven't been verified by
laboratories," he said. "Saudi health officials called us and inquired
about the spread of a disease in the border provinces. We told them
that it is chikungunya and assured them that the disease is under
control and far away from the Saudi border," he said.

However, another medical source gave a different assessment of the
situation. Dr. Najeeb Molha, head of the Hodeidah doctors' syndicate
who is also working with disease-fighting teams, said the disease is
not chikungunya. "Chikungunya doesn't claim this high a number of
lives. Chikungunya sprang up in the area in the last 3 months of 2010
and does not exist anymore," he said.

Molha said the symptoms of the disease are fever, diarrhea, renal
failure and sudden increase in the number of white blood cells and
granulocytes. "To my knowledge, 65 people have died because of the
disease, and 250 people are in hospitals. I think it is a kind of
hemorrhagic fever. Our interference has helped in bringing down the
number of victims and lessening the panic," he said.

The director of Hodeidah's provincial health office refused to
comment on the matter, saying he is waiting for the minister of health
to complete his investigations.

Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease with symptoms similar to dengue
fever, occurs mainly in Africa, Asia and the Indian subcontinent.

[It is difficult to determine whether this outbreak is a totally new
one or a partial continuation of an outbreak reported in November 2010
(see ProMED-mail archive number 20101125.4246). The November 2010
outbreak reported low mortality and arthritis, much more compatible
with symptoms of chikungunya virus infections than the current report
above. The current outbreak may be one of mixed etiologies, but the
fatalities are extremely unlikely to have been caused by chikungunya
virus infection. One wonders whether the cases diagnosed by the
laboratory in Egypt were fatal ones or just febrile patients.
Curiously, no mention is made of arthralgia in the current report,
which is a key feature of chikungunya virus infections, leading one to
wonder whether the laboratory diagnoses of chikungunya virus infection
were made on serological grounds and reflect past rather than current
infections. Further information would be appreciated.
