Following the occurrence of lethal encephalitis in 3 breeders of variegated squirrels (_Sciurus variegatoides_) in Saxony Anhalt from 2011 to 2013, comprehensive investigations on a possible infectious origin were carried out at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine (BNITM). At first, no leads could be found regarding the cause of the disease. The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) on the isle of Riems then investigated samples of a variegated squirrel from the holdings of one of the deceased breeders. It was only the genetic analysis of organ samples of the squirrel that provided sequence information which pointed to the presence of a novel Bornavirus. Subsequent molecular, biological, and immunohistological tests also provided evidence for its presence in brain samples of the deceased patients. Based on the currently available information, the new virus is clearly different from all previously known Bornaviruses. At the moment, it is not known whether these are isolated cases.

It cannot be ruled out that the diseases of the 3 patients could have been caused by transmission of the novel Bornavirus from infected animals. The transmission path so far is unknown; bites and scratches appear to be a likely means of acquiring infection. Test methods for virus detection were developed and validated at the FLI and are available for further analyses. BNITM, FLI, and Robert Koch Institute are cooperating with veterinary and health authorities at federal and state levels to further clarify the situation. The FLI on the isle of Riems carries out tests on the occurrence of this virus in animals. In addition, persons keeping variegated squirrels are screened for possible other cases of infection. The BNITM in Hamburg carries out analogous analyses in spinal fluid of patients with encephalitis of unknown origin. Until more data become available, as a preventive measure, direct contact with variegated squirrels should be avoided. If a variegated squirrel develops disease or dies of unknown causes, the owner should inform the veterinarian, who, if necessary, can then initiate further investigations.

In connection with the FLI's and the BNITM's discovery of this new, possibly zoonotic Bornavirus, it still needs to be clarified whether the virus was imported with infected squirrels or whether the squirrel was infected by another animal species.

Three cases of fatal encephalitis in breeders of variegated squirrels in Germany are possibly linked to a newly identified type of Bornavirus, a zoonotic pathogen which can affect various animal species and possibly cause psychiatric disorders in humans. All infected persons bred variegated squirrels, a type of tree squirrel common to Central America that can be kept as an exotic pet. A Bornavirus strain different from all currently known Bornaviruses so far was found in the patients and in a squirrel belonging to one of the patients.

The cases are still under investigation, and there is no proof yet of a direct relationship between the presence of the Bornavirus and the encephalitis, hence, a zoonotic infection with Bornavirus has not been confirmed.

However, there could be a higher risk of exposure to infection for variegated squirrel breeders, their family members, and the owners of variegated squirrel pets. At present, such risk cannot be assessed because of the low number of cases reported, the lack of information about the new virus, its transmission and connection to the infection in variegated squirrels.

It is advised that direct contact with living or dead variegated squirrels should be avoided as a precautionary measure, the ECDC risk assessment concluded.

[Borna disease virus (BDV) is known as a veterinary pathogen that, in addition to ungulates and carnivores, also infects humans at least occasionally and has its suspected host among small wild mammals. Animal Borna disease (BD) has classically been described as a chronic, progressive meningoencephalomyelitis, causing both neurological and behavioural symptoms in horses and sheep. During recent decades, milder manifestations and a wider host range have also been seen. In humans, numerous neuropsychiatric entities have been reported to be associated with potential markers of BDV infection, but the evidence remains inconclusive, and the true prevalence and causative role are questionable.

The above information, and the following (edited) chapter "Ecology and epidemiology", are summarised from a comprehensive review (ref 1), where the deleted references can be found.

"Ecology and epidemiology
1. Geographical distribution
Signs of BDV infection, including antibodies, antigen, RNA and/or virus itself, have been reported from animals in many continents. The highest clinical incidence of BD in animals manifesting neurological BDV infection verified by virus isolation is restricted to central Europe. In other countries (in Europe, Asia, USA, Australia), the possible activity of the virus has been demonstrated by antibody, RNA and/or antigen findings; see map in the referenced review (ref 1). Although it seems probable that not all BDV reports are reproducible, the virus or its close relative is distributed widely. Whether some of the findings are in fact caused by ABVs, endogenized Bornavirus genes, or as-yet-unknown Bornaviruses remains to be shown.

2. Species diversity
BDV has long been known to infect and cause disease in horses. Later, natural infections with BDV or a BDV-like agent were also verified in humans, various herbivores (sheep, goat, cow, deer, llama, alpaca, rabbit, pygmy hippopotamus) as well as dog, cat, monkey, sloth, lynx and, recently, the shrew. Evidence also exists of infections in ostrich, fox, mallard and jackdaw, wild voles, macaque and raccoon. In addition, this neurotropic virus experimentally infects tree shrew, rhesus monkey, chicken, rat, mouse, hamster, Mongolian gerbil, guinea pig and bank vole. Despite the wide possible host range, the incidence of BD in species other than horses and sheep appears low. As a sporadic and relatively poorly known disease, BD commonly seems to escape diagnosis.

3. Human BD?
As BDV infects a wide variety of animal species with a predilection for the limbic system, and occasionally induces persistent emotional, cognitive and behavioural alterations in experimental animals, including primates and their ancestors, tree shrews (_Tupaia glis_), the question has arisen of whether the virus could also be a human pathogen and cause neuropsychiatric disorders. The 1st evidence of human infections was reported in 1985: 0.43-12.5 per cent of patients with diverse psychiatric disorders had BDV antibodies in serum, whereas the seroprevalence in the control group was 0.5 per cent. The seropositive patients were diagnosed to have a primary major depressive disorder. The majority of later studies have also reported higher BDV marker prevalence in some patient groups than in controls -- that is, in unspecified psychiatric inpatients, neurotic, personality adjustment and mood-disorder patients, schizophrenics and patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. However, signs of infection are not present in all patient groups, and control or comparison groups also sometimes harbour signs of BDV infection. Furthermore, despite the association of detected BDV markers with some psychiatric diseases in numerous (but not all) studies, conclusions on the causal relationships are impossible to draw. The situation is even more complicated by the facts that no consensus exists on the method that should be used for BDV diagnosis and that, based on sequence identity, many PCR results and even virus isolation from human peripheral blood cells have been suspected to have arisen from contamination by a control strain. A recent (2012) study using extremely tight criteria for BDV positivity found neither BDV RNA nor verifiable BDV antibodies in the blood samples of Californian psychiatric patients.

Despite the controversies, there are researchers who consider that the existence of potential "human BD" has been demonstrated and is common. Especially controversial, however, are their findings based on the triple-ELISA method. In addition, other serological BDV methods also have been suspected to produce unspecific results; this suspicion seems to be commoner for BDV than for other viral infections. Nonetheless, a very few human BDV infections have been carefully documented with a combination of reproducible and controlled methods. This suggests that BDV can indeed infect humans, but the frequency of human infections, the role of endogenized Bornaviral genes and, most importantly, the existence of potential human BD are still questionable."

ECDC rapid risk assessment of the new Borna virus, published on 25 Feb 2015, is available at http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/new-bornavirus-strain-detected-EU-rapid-risk-assessment.pdf.

The rodent variegated squirrel (_Sciurus variegatoides_) is a tree squirrel in the genus _Sciurus_ endemic to Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, southern Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama). There are 14 sub-species. The variegated squirrel can be kept as an exotic pet; a picture is at http://www.naturephoto-cz.com/variegated-squirrel-photo-7388.html.

The following information has been provided by the ECDC. Borna disease virus (BDV) infections were 1st described in the 18th century and were named after the town of Borna, near Leipzig, Germany, where an epizootic condition was described in 1885 among military horses, monkeys, and ostriches. BDV related avian Bornaviruses (ABV) have been recently described in psittacine birds, Canada geese, trumpeter and mute swans, and canary birds.

Animal BDV infections have been described in central Europe, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and the United States of America. In 2000 in Austria, Nowotny and colleagues described a new subtype of BDV isolated from a horse that was euthanized due to severe and incurable neurological disease. The new subtype differed from the reference strains by more than 15 per cent and was difficult to detect by standard reverse transcriptase PCR protocols. This indicated that the genome of BDV is far more variable than previously assumed and that naturally occurring subtypes may escape detection by currently used diagnostic assays.

In animals, BDV infection may lead to an acute or sub-acute disease with meningo-encephalitis or mild manifestations with alteration or impairment of nerve-cell functions. The specific disease syndromes depend on many host factors including the species, breed, age, and immunological status of the animal at the time of infection. In classical Borna disease, paralysis is common, and death occurs within 5 weeks in the majority of animals. Recovery is possible with life-long altered behaviour. Avian Bornaviruses are the causative agents of pro-ventricular dilatation disease, a fatal neurological disease considered to be a major threat to psittacine bird populations. Small wild animals are the most probable vectors and reservoirs of BDV infection, although the epidemiology is not fully understood. Arthropods and birds have also been investigated as possible BDV reservoirs.

The first evidence of possible human infections with Bornaviruses resulted from a study published in 1985 showing that patients with major depressive psychiatric disorders had a higher Bornavirus-related seroprevalence as compared with the control groups. The majority of later studies also reported the higher seroprevalence or other BDV markers in patients presenting with diverse psychiatric disorders. However, it was not possible to infer the causal relationship between BDV infection and psychiatric disorder because of the occasional presence of the infectious markers in control patient groups, proven viral contamination of laboratory samples, and the disagreement on diagnostic methods for BDV. However, very few studies that employed a combination of reproducible and controlled methods suggest that BDV infection in humans is possible. Nevertheless, the frequency of human infections, the role of endogenised Bornavirus genes, and the existence of potential human BD are still uncertain.

Taxonomically, Borna disease viruses are classified as negative-strand RNA viruses. This classification been complicated by the detection of endogenous sequences - Mod.CP
