1st Report of the Root-Knot Nematode _Meloidogyne ethiopica_ on
Tomato in Slovenia.
S. Sirca and G. Urek, Agricultural Institute of Slovenia, Hacquetova
17, 1001 Ljubjana, Slovenia; and G. Karssen, Plant Protection
Service, Geertjesweg 15, 6700 HC Wageningen, the Netherlands. Plant
Dis. 88:680, 2004; published on-line as D-2004-0407-01N, 2004.
Accepted for publication 21 Jan 2004.
The root-knot nematode _Meloidogyne ethiopica_ Whitehead originally
described from Tanzania is also distributed in South Africa,
Zimbabwe, and Ethiopia (3). Although this species is a relatively
unknown root-knot nematode, _M. ethiopica_ parasitizes several
economically important crops, such as tomato, cowpea, bean, cabbage,
pepper, pumpkin, tobacco, lettuce, and soybean (4).
This species can be morphologically confused with _M. incognita_
(Kofoid & White), and therefore is probably easily overlooked (1).
Recently, characteristic esterase isozyme patterns were described for
this species, which provide a more reliable identification (2).
In October 2003, _Lycopersicum esculentum_ cv. Belle plants with
large root-galls were observed in a greenhouse at Dornberk, Slovenia,
which were identified as an unknown root-knot nematode within the _M.
incognita_ group. Subsequent sampling revealed infestation of all
tomato plants within this greenhouse with obvious aboveground
symptoms of stunting and wilting. Additional morphological and
isozyme studies identified this root-knot nematode as _M. ethiopica_.
The identification was based on female, male, and 2nd-stage juvenile
morphology and malate dehydrogenase and esterase isozyme phenotypes
from young egg-laying females isolated from 20 tomato plants and
compared with a culture of _M. ethiopica_ from Africa.
To our knowledge, this is not only the 1st report of _M. ethiopica_
in Slovenia, but also the 1st report of this species in Europe.

[Root knot nematodes cause crop yield reductions by interfering with
nutrient flow in the xylem. Infected plants are less vigorous than
healthy plants and are susceptible to wilting at high temperatures.
Disease management utilizes several strategies: weed control because
they are often hosts; resistant host cultivars; rotation with
resistant varieties and non-host crops; and soil fumigation using
broad-spectrum fumigants to reduce fungi and nematode populations.
