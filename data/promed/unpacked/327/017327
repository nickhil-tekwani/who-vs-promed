South Korea's cattle ranchers and pig farmers want the government to
destroy more animals to contain the deadly Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) of
livestock, the National Livestock Cooperatives Federation (NLCF) said on
Wednesday.
"Farmers believe the situation warrants drastic action by the government,"
said NLCF chairman Shin Koo-bum.
"They want (the government) to destroy more livestock in areas where
outbreaks occurred in order to contain the contagion instead of purchasing
the animals."
Shin said the government should destroy all livestock within a 3-km (2
mile) radius of the outbreaks versus the current 500-meter radius.
The proposal would also help reduce a possible glut of meat on the local
market when the outbreak of FMD is over, Shin said.
The disease scare has brought what farmers hoped would be a $400 million
pork export industry this year to a screeching halt.
Authorities announced the first suspected outbreak of FMD on March 27, and
later confirmed it, prompting Japan, Korea's main pork market, as well as
other countries to suspend imports of pork, beef and dairy products from
Korea.
The government offered to buy pigs destined for export markets and later
made the same offer for healthy pigs in areas affected by outbreaks, but
few farmers took it up, saying the price was too low.
"If the government releases the meat it buys on the market later, while
exports are still impossible, domestic meat prices will tumble, which will
affect farmers," Shin said.
Agriculture Ministry officials have said it is not realistic to slaughter
tens of thousands of healthy cattle and pigs although the government
understands the farmers' desire to eradicate the disease and resume pork
exports.
"What if there is another FMD outbreak next year, after destroying a bunch
of healthy animals?" a ministry official said.
As of Tuesday, Korean authorities had destroyed 2223 animals at or near the
areas where FMD outbreaks have been reported. The fatal and highly
contagious disease affects animals with split hooves.
"We can judge exactly how much damage has been done when the FMD is
completely eradicated," Shin said.
"Damages, however, might be as much as those on Taiwan," he said, taking
into account the bans on pork exports, reduction of local meat consumption
and bearish meat prices.
An outbreak of FMD in Taiwan in 1997 forced authorities to slaughter a
quarter of the island's 14 million pigs and decimated what had been a $1.55
billion-a-year pork export industry.
The agriculture ministry said cattle at a total of 15 farms along the
western coast have been infected so far.
