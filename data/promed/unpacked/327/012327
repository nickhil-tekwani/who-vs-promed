The 1st death caused by H5N1 bird flu in Viet Nam in 2014 has been reported in southern Binh Phuc province, the country's Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry of Health announced late Monday [20 Jan 2014].

The victim, a man aged 52, was hospitalized on 11 Jan 2014 due to symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient was later confirmed infected with the virus, said the announcement, adding that his lung was damaged quickly. He died on 18 Jan 2014, the 1st death in Viet Nam in 2014 after 9 months without any H5N1 bird flu cases reported in humans.

The department recommended that local people should not eat sick, dead, or unknown-origin poultry. When poultry are detected sick or dead, local authorities should be informed immediately.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.

Viet Nam's health officials on 20 Jan 2014 confirmed a 1st H5N1 avian flu death in the southern province of Binh Phuoc, the 1st in 2014.

The 52-year-old man, living in Binh Minh commune, Bu Dang district, was hospitalised on 11 Jan 2014, showing flu-like symptoms such as fever, coughing, and breathing difficulties. The patient was moved to Binh Phuoc provincial General Hospital 6 days later, yet his health continued deteriorating quickly. He was then brought to HCM City Hospital for Tropical Diseases on 18 Jan 2014 for emergency treatment, but he died on the same day. His blood sample tested positive for the deadly virulent strain A/H5N1. He was said to have slaughtered ducks and eaten duck meat. Epidemiological examinations show that a number of chickens raised by the patient's family and neighbours died of unknown causes.

The Preventive Medicine Department directed the Binh Phuoc provincial Department of Health to conduct epidemiological tests and intensify measures against a possible outbreak of bird flu in the locality. The HCM City Pasteur Institute was required to fan out to the affected commune to help with prevention.
