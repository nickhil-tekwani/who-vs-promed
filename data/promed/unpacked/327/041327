Update on the situation of _Synchytrium endobioticum_ in Georgia
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Potato wart disease caused by _Synchytrium endobioticum_ (EPPO A2 List) was 1st detected on potato in home gardens in 2009-2013 in Khulo district. In 2016-2018, more outbreaks were detected in different home gardens in northern Georgia.

Isolates of _S. endobioticum_ were tested to identify the pathotype. The pathotype found in Georgia is not known in Europe. This pathotype resembles pathotype 38, which was detected in the non‚ÄêEuropean part of Turkey.

[Potato wart disease (PW) is caused by the fungus _Synchytrium endobioticum_, which is considered one of the most important pathogens of the crop. It is endemic in Europe and has also been reported from a number of locations in the Americas, Australasia and Africa. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some solanaceous weeds.

On infected tubers, "eyes" develop into characteristic warty, cauliflower-like swellings. If infected early, the whole tuber can be replaced by a warty proliferation. Warts darken with age and eventually rot and disintegrate. Plant vigour is reduced, both quantity and quality of harvested tubers are severely affected. Diagnosis requires laboratory confirmation, as similar symptoms can be caused by other pathogens. The fungus goes through cycles of proliferation and re-infection as long as cool, wet conditions prevail and is, therefore, less damaging in warm, light, well drained soils.

The disease is spread with soil (for example on farm tools), by infected seed tubers and also in manure from animals fed on infected potatoes. The fungus can survive in soil for up to 40 years in the absence of a host. Disease management is based on pathogen exclusion by quarantine regulations and the control of local pathogen spread. Fungicides are ineffective, but some experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to kill resting sporangia (see link below).

There are several pathotypes defined by their virulence on different host cultivars. Potato varieties resistant to a number of them have been developed, but new pathogen strains are emerging, compromising the efficacy of host plant resistance.

In Georgia, recently an import ban of potatoes from Turkey was imposed (ProMED-mail post 20180327.5712463) to prevent introductions of the pathogen from there. However, from the analysis of pathotypes reported above as originating in Turkey, that seems to have been too late. In Turkey, potato wart was reported for the 1st time in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050406.0990).
