[This immediate notification answered the request for information in posting 20160112.3930530. The event published in that posting referred to low pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1.

According to the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs' (DEFRA) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency's (APHA) "Guidance on Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)": "On 13 Jan 2016 the Scottish authorities confirmed a case of low severity (H5N1) avian influenza (bird flu) [http://tinyurl.com/ho84zux] on a poultry breeding farm in Dunfermline. The restrictions imposed on [10 Jan 2016] remain in place as part of the robust procedures for dealing swiftly with avian influenza." See information at https://www.gov.uk/avian-influenza-bird-flu. - Mod.CRD

According to the OIE notification, the poultry flock involved includes approximately 40 000 housed 57-week-old broiler breeder hens. Not a single 'case' observed; what led the owner and/or authorities to suspect avian influenza? was the flock tested within an active surveillance plan? Obviously, the lack of clinical cases is indicative of an extremely mild virus strain. There are prescribed criteria/tests to determine the pathogenicity rate of avian influenza strains. The results of such tests are, reportedly, pending. - Mod.AS
