Heavy rains continued to pound Ivory Coast's cocoa growing regions
last week [week of 28 Jun 2010] bringing disease, but a sunny spell
at the end raised hopes for bean quality. Farmers reported worrying
signs of black pod disease flourishing which they feared would damage
more pods.

Last year's [2009] paltry crop was the worst for 5 years. The 2010
rainy season has been unusually heavy, swelling pods and boosting
supply. But the rains have also washed away key supply routes and
triggered ominous signs of black pod and swollen shoot disease. Black
clouds have blotted out the sun needed for beans to grow large and be
dried when harvested.

Farmers are worried about black pod. In coastal regions of San Pedro
and Sassandra, farmers said abundant rains were facilitating the
spread of the black pod disease, with some trying to fight it with
chemicals. "Black pod disease is back and we are treating 9000
hectares in our cooperative," said a cooperative manager in San Pedro.

In the western regions of Gagnoa and Soubre the weather was adequate.
In the centre west Daloa region, farmers said they had received
enough sun to enable them to dry beans properly. There were similar
sunnier conditions in the southern regions of Tiassale and Aboisso.

[Black pod
----------
Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal
disease affecting cocoa worldwide. In Africa, the fungus-like
pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated
with it, but 2 additional species are found in the Americas. _P.
palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses as
high as 95 percent in very humid climates, with every pod affected.
It is estimated to kill up to 10 percent of trees annually through
stem cankers. Pods progressively turn a dark brown. Losses are most
severe when pods are infected during the two months prior to ripening.

Black pod is spread by insects, mechanical means, plant debris,
water, and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur
in plantations with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci
simultaneously. Genetic resistance is generally low in commercial
cocoa cultivars. Disease management is difficult and needs an
integrated approach, including cultural techniques, phytosanitary
measures, and targeted fungicide use.

Swollen shoot
-------------
Swollen shoot disease of cocoa is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot
virus_ (CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) and can lead to severe crop losses.
CSSV is thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African
forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains from severe
effects on shoots and roots to no symptoms at all. The virus is
spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may
also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed
transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean plant
material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected
trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and
native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Breeding programmes for
virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties have been initiated.

In Cote d'Ivoire, a project to fight swollen shoot (ProMED-mail post
20080302.0860) was launched, however, doubts have been cast on CSSV
field resistance of the new varieties for replanting. Black pod was a
concern in 2009 in different regions of the country (ProMED-mail post
20090521.1896) with Gagnoa and Soubre being worst affected.
