The Instituto Nacional de Higiene Rafael Rangel has reported a new
epizootic of suspected yellow fever (YF) [in monkeys] in epidemiologic week
No. 3, 2005 in the State of Apure [a border state with Colombia in western
Venezuela]. This epizootic has been ongoing since December 2004.
This epizootic, occurred in the El Porvenir Ranch, Bruzual parish, in Mu�
municipality, which has a reported vaccination coverage of 182 percent
[from administrative data] and has been intensifying vaccination activities
[thus reducing the risk of human infection. � Mod.JW].
The surrounding municipalities have the following vaccination coverages:
Paez 160 percent, Romulo Gallegos 114 percent, and Achaguas 137 percent. In
the State of Barinas (border state with Apure), municipalities have the
following vaccination coverages: Pedraza 81 percent, Barinas 61 percent,
Obispos 72 percent, and Sosa 158 percent. Mass vaccination is being carried
out and the real vaccination coverage is being checked.

[Administrative figures are estimated by using the number of doses of
vaccine administered as the numerator, and estimations of the target
population as the denominator. Reasons for observed vaccination coverages
greater than 100 percent include, among others, underestimation of the
target population, inclusion of people from geographic areas not included
in the denominator (such as neighboring municipalities), and errors in
tabulations, for this reason, when knowledge of true vaccination coverages
is necessary (such as this situation), a vaccination coverage survey of the
population is conducted. - Mod.MPP/JW]
