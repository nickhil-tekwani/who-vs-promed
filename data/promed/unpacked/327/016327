European vaccine advisors today [29 May 2020] recommended the approval of Johnson & Johnson's 2-dose Ebola vaccine, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said today.

The European Commission gives final approval, but it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory committee. The vaccine, the 2nd to be approved for Ebola, was introduced for use in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in November 2019 as part of a clinical trial. The vaccine's 2 doses are given 8 weeks apart.

No new cases have been reported in the DRC's outbreak since officials reported a cluster of 7 cases recently in Beni, meaning the total stands at 3463, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update yesterday [28 May 2020]. So far, no definitive source in the cluster has been found. The outbreak will be considered over if no new cases are reported before 25 Jun 2020.

[Original report from European Medicines Society 29 May 2020: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/new-vaccine-prevention-ebola-virus-disease-recommended-approval-european-union.

There are a number of Ebola vaccines that have either been approved or are in development. The 1st vaccine to be approved in the United States was rVSV-ZEBOV in December 2019. VSV-EBOV or rVSV-ZEBOV, sold under the brand name Ervebo, is a vaccine based on the vesicular stomatitis virus, which was genetically modified to express a surface glycoprotein of Zaire Ebola virus. In November 2019, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization. The WHO prequalification came fewer than 48 hours later, making it the fastest vaccine prequalification process ever conducted by WHO. In December 2019, it was approved for medical use in the United States. It had been used extensively in the Kivu Ebola epidemic under a compassionate use protocol.

The Johnson & Johnson's [Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson] 2-dose Ebola vaccine is the 2nd now to have been approved. This vaccine is a 2-dose vaccine -- Adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein/MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) -- see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_vaccine for references.

Janssen's investigational Ebola vaccine regimen is specifically designed to support preventive vaccination in countries that are at risk of Ebola outbreaks, as well as for other at-risk groups such as healthcare workers, Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) lab workers, military deployed from other countries, airport staff and visitors to high-risk countries. Janssen is collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO) on vaccine pre-qualification to broaden access of its investigational Ebola vaccine regimen to those most in need and enable registration in African countries; European Commission (EC) approval of this regimen may help accelerate this process.

28 May 2020. Update
[WHO. Disease outbreak news (abridged, edited)]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/28-May-2020-ebola-drc/en/

From 20-26 May 2020, no new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Since the resurgence of the outbreak on 10 Apr 2020, there have been a number of Ebola vaccines to prevent Ebola that are either approved or in development. The 1st vaccine to be approved in the United States was rVSV-ZEBOV in December 2019. It had been used extensively in Kivu Ebola epidemic under a compassionate use protocol. Seven confirmed cases have been reported from Kasanga, Malepe and Kanzulinzuli Health Areas in Beni Health Zone. Investigations into the origin of the last cluster of cases in Beni Health Zone are ongoing. To date, no definitive source of infection has been identified.

From 20-26 May 2020, an average of 2715 alerts were reported per day, of which 2709 (over 99%) were investigated within 24 hours. Of these, an average of 404 alerts were validated as suspected cases each day, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule-out EVD. In the past 2 weeks, there was a slight decrease in overall and validated alerts in Beni Health Zone. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided from 8 laboratories. From 18-24 May 2020, 3065 samples were tested including 2313 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 331 swabs from community deaths; and 421 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, laboratory activities increased by 7% compared to the previous week.

On 22 May 2020, 2 historic probable cases reported in Mabalako and Lubero Health Zones were validated from people who had onset of symptoms in March 2019 and July 2019. As of 26 May 2020, a total of 3463 EVD cases, including 3317 confirmed and 146 probable cases have been reported. Of these, 2280 people died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) and 1171 survived. Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 57% (n=1970) were female, 29% (n=1002) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers.

On 14 May 2020, the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo began the 42-day countdown to the declaration of the end of the EVD outbreak. Given the long duration and large magnitude of this outbreak and the fact that the virus is present in animal reservoirs in the region, there is a risk of re-emergence of the virus in the period leading up to, and beyond, the declaration of the end of the outbreak. It is crucial to maintain a strong and robust surveillance system in order to detect, isolate, test and treat new suspected cases as early as possible and to break possible chains of transmission. Continued coordination and communication among partners, authorities and affected communities along with EVD survivor advocacy remain essential in this outbreak response.

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 22 May 2020:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 3463, of which 3317 are confirmed and 145 probable. In total, there were 2280 deaths (2134 confirmed and 145 probable) and 1171 (cured persons, or survivors);
- 395 suspected cases under investigation;
- 1 new case confirmed validated in North Kivu in Mabalako;
- no new deaths of confirmed cases;
- Since the resurgence of the Ebola epidemic in Beni on 10 April 2020, 7 confirmed cases have been registered, of which 4 died, 2 were healed and one escaped.
- Further research has been done on the confirmed case from 16 Apr 2020 hidden in the community, 36 days after notification and 40 days after the start of symptoms.

DRC reported +1 probable cases [23 May 2020]. No word when the case occurred, but I don't think it can be recent because it was at Mabalako and there hasn't been a case there in nearly 4 months. Also, report says there hasn't been a new case in 25 days.]

[2] Research: impact of COVID-19

McDonald Helen I, et al. Early impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and physical distancing measures on routine childhood vaccinations in England, January to April 2020. Euro Surveill. 2020;25(19):pii=2000848. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.19.2000848

Using electronic health records, we assessed the early impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on routine childhood vaccination in England by 26 Apr 2020. Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination counts fell from February 2020, and in the 3 weeks after introduction of physical distancing measures were 19.8% lower (95% confidence interval: 20.7 to 18.9) than the same period in 2019, before improving in mid-April 2020. A gradual decline in hexavalent vaccination counts throughout 2020 was not accentuated by physical distancing.

Childhood vaccination coverage in the United Kingdom (UK) is routinely monitored quarterly, but more timely monitoring is required during the disruption of a pandemic. We analysed electronic patient records from primary care to describe changes in delivery of 1st doses of hexavalent vaccine (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b and hepatitis B) and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine as part of the routine childhood vaccination programme in England during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak until 26 Apr 2020 (weeks 1 to 17).

Two key milestones in the routine childhood immunisation programme delivered in primary care are 1st universal vaccinations at the age of 8 weeks, which include the hexavalent vaccine, and vaccinations at the age of 1 year, which include the 1st dose of MMR vaccine.

Discussion
MMR vaccination started falling in 2020 before introduction of physical distancing measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. In the 1st 3 weeks of physical distancing, MMR vaccination counts were 19.8% lower (95% CI: 20.7 to 18.9) than for the same period in 2019. There was a general decrease in hexavalent vaccinations delivered in 2020 compared with 2019, but no evidence of an increase in the rate of decline with the introduction of physical distancing measures. Counts of both vaccinations increased in weeks 16 and 17, despite physical distancing measures remaining in place.

One plausible explanation is that COVID-19 messaging about staying home initially overwhelmed the message that the immunisation programme was to remain operating as usual. In England, this appears to have affected MMR vaccination more than primary infant vaccinations, and qualitative work is underway to explore the reasons for this. The message to continue routine immunisation programmes became more visible when the Joint Committee for Immunisation and Vaccination published a statement in week 16, on 17 Apr. The relative increase in week 16 of 2020 compared with 2019 could partly be attributed to a low vaccination count in 2019 because of school holidays; a similar decrease was seen in the same week in 2018 and 2017. This effect may have been less relevant in 2020 when schools were closed from week 13, and it was not possible to go on holidays because of the lockdown. However, a percent increase was also observed in week 17 for both vaccinations. This is promising for an early recovery in vaccination delivery following the encouragement to continue vaccinating but will need monitoring to ensure it is sustained.

Our findings are consistent with reports of decreased vaccine counts in other high-income countries. In particular, in the United States, routine paediatric vaccine counts decreased after a national emergency was declared on 13 Mar 2020 and have recovered somewhat for measles-containing vaccinations to children younger than 2 years, which the authors suggest could reflect promotion of childhood vaccinations in the context of the pandemic for this age-group.

National physical distancing guidance is being applied across all regions, but the impact of the pandemic and physical distancing may vary by region, either as a result of a varying burden of disease (reducing healthcare capacity or preventing attendance), behavioural change (including physical distancing measures) or local initiatives to enable vaccination to continue. The greatest percent decrease in MMR vaccination in weeks 13 to 15 was seen in London, which had a high burden of COVID-19, but decreases in MMR vaccination were seen across all regions in this period, including regions with a low incidence of COVID-19 infection, suggesting that the changes were not solely due to COVID-19 infection burden. SystmOne use varies regionally but it is unlikely that software system choice would result in vaccination counts being unrepresentative within regions.
