On [Tue 24 May 2016], 5 veterinary teams started a vaccination campaign against lumpy skin disease [LSD] in Wadi Al-Jadid [New Valley] governorate, in anticipation of the possible entry of infected smuggled cattle from neighboring governorates.

Dr Boulis Shawki, director general of preventive veterinary medicine of the governorate, said the vaccination is performed in 5 veterinary departments of the 5 administrative subdivisions of the governorate, to immunize their cattle population. He added that both veterinarians and technicians are involved in the vaccination campaign.

[According to published history, lumpy skin disease was recognized for the 1st time in Egypt as a clinical disease of cattle in May 1988 in the Suez governorate, suspected to have arrived at the local quarantine station with cattle imported from Africa. The disease spread locally in the summer of 1988 and apparently overwintered with little or no manifestation of clinical disease, reappearing in the summer of 1989 and, in a period of 5 to 6 months, spreading to 22 of the 26 governorates of Egypt. A rapid reaction to the problem led to the vaccination of nearly 2 million cattle with a sheep pox vaccine. Morbidity in this epizootic was low, reportedly 2 per cent of the whole cattle population (of about 3 million cattle). About 1500 died.

The disease has become endemic and mass vaccinations of cattle have been applied annually since then, covering about 1.5-3.0 million vaccinations per year, estimated to exceed 50 per cent of Egypt's cattle population and in some years reaching higher coverage. Buffaloes (about 2.3 million in Egypt) have not been included in the vaccination. The number of officially reported cattle vaccinations since 1996 are as follows (in millions, rounded): 1996 (1.5); 1997 (1.6); 1998 (2.1): 1999 (1.9); 2000 (not available); 2001 2.3); 2002 (1.7); 2003 (2.3); 2004 (2.1);2006 (1.3); 2007 (3.0); 2008 (0.7); 2009 (1.2); 2010 (2.0); 2011 (2.3); 2012 (1.9); 2013 (1.2); 2014 (1.5).

Exacerbations of lumpy skin disease have been reported in 1990, 2006, 2014. A steady rise in the incidence of clinical lumpy skin disease has been observed in Egypt since 2012. According to the annual reports to the OIE, the number of recorded outbreaks of clinical lumpy skin disease been as follows: 2011 (0), 2012 (2), 2013 (7), 2014 (43), 2015 (January to June, 33).

The following request for information, published by Mod.AB in ProMED-mail's regional network MENA (Middle East North Africa), posting no. 20160524.4242515, is herewith joined:

"The source report states that a vaccination campaign was launched in Wadi Al-Jadid governorate to immunize its cattle population and protect it from possible incursion of the disease from another governorate. However, no information is given on the prevalence of LSD in various Egyptian governorates or the target population that will be undergoing vaccination. Likewise, the nature of the vaccine is not disclosed. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources."

We would also appreciate information on Egypt's experience regarding lumpy skin disease in buffaloes. According to OIE's lumpy skin disease data, domestic Asian buffalo are included among the species susceptible to the lumpy skin disease virus (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/LUMPY_SKIN_DISEASE_FINAL.pdf). - Mod.AS
