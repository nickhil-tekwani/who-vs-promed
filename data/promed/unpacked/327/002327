Typhoid hits hundreds in Tajikistan
------------------------------------
Some 600 people, including children, have fallen ill in an outbreak of
typhoid fever during the past month in the capital of land-locked
Tajikistan in Central Asia. At least 1 person has died as a result of the
outbreak, which officials several weeks ago said had affected 300 people in
Dushanbe.
The spread of the disease has been blamed on untreated drinking water piped
to the half million inhabitants of Dushanbe from a nearby mountain river,
the Varzob.
Many of Dushanbe's hospitals and clinics are full to overflowing, and the
number of sick may well exceed the official figure. The authorities set up
a special task force to halt the spread of the outbreak, sending 1000
medical staff around the city to warn inhabitants not to drink tap water
and closing off water supplies in schools and kindergartens.
The last major epidemic of typhoid fever in Tajikistan broke out in 1997,
when more than 17 000 people fell ill and dozens died.
