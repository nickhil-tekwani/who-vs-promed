Jamileth Marina, Director of the Tonosi Hospital, said that the patient is stable at home. The patient is a young 32-year-old resident of Cacao de Tonosi.

[Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo virus. As noted in the comment for the previously posted Los Santos cases (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150204.3140834), Choclo virus is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. There were 75 cases of presumed Choclo virus infection last year (2014), and case numbers have begun to mount again this year (2015). Elimination of trash and food sources that attract and harbor the rodent reservoir, as well as careful cleanup practices to avoid production of aerosolized virus-contaminated materials, such as rodent excreta, will help to prevent exposure and infection. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents are found in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
