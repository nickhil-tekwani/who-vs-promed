Authorities were alerted to the disease after a 44-year-old man from Hechi, Guangxi [Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region] passed away on 27 Oct 2018. The man developed symptoms of avian influenza on 18 Oct 2018 and was hospitalised 3 days later.

When questioned about his illness in hospital, the man denied that he had contact with live poultry before the onset of the symptoms.

This is the 2nd human case in as many months in Guangxi after a 42-year-old man became infected with H5N6 avian influenza after handling poultry.

The Centre for Health Protection has advised travellers heading to mainland China and other affected areas to avoid visiting wet markets, live poultry markets or farms.

The firm also advised consumers not to purchase live or freshly slaughtered poultry and said they should be alert to the presence of backyard poultry.

Travellers returning from affected areas should consult a doctor promptly if symptoms develop, and inform the doctor of their travel history for prompt diagnosis and treatment of potential diseases.

The Centre for Health Protection said it would be working closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments in the infected areas.

From 2014 to date, 22 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N6) have been reported by China's mainland health authorities.

[2] Hong Kong: H7N9 transmission alert

Hong Kong's health minister promised the government would stay alert over any possible outbreak of bird flu in the city as new research in Japan confirmed the H7N9 virus could be transmitted via respiratory droplets. Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Siu-chee on [Sun 4 Nov 2018] said the government had done a lot in the prevention and surveillance of bird flu at local farms and markets selling live poultry.

"We will continue to communicate with international organisations and health organisations to understand more about avian flu and the risks," she said. Her remarks followed a report that University of Tokyo researchers had confirmed the H7N9 bird flu virus could be transmitted via respiratory droplets.

Researchers placed a healthy ferret and one infected with the virus in separate cages 7 cm apart. 4 days later, they found the healthy ferret was infected. Droplets containing the virus were found 80 cm from the sick animal.

H7N9 is a subtype of the influenza virus which has been detected in birds in the past. It was first seen in people in 2013 in China. Most patients infected become severely ill.

Most of those infected had reported recent exposure to live poultry or potentially contaminated environments, especially markets where live birds were sold, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said.

The virus does not appear to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported.
As of 27 Oct 2018, there had been 1567 human cases of H7N9 reported globally since March 2013. Hong Kong had 21 cases, all imported.

University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said research by Chinese scientists in 2013 obtained similar findings to the Japanese study.

"This is not something new. That bird flu can be transmitted via respiratory droplets is widely accepted in medical circles." Citing the WHO's surveillance programme, Ho said the risk of a large outbreak remained low.

"But I am not suggesting people take it lightly," Ho said. "It is no laughing matter if a person gets bird flu. People should avoid going to markets where live poultry is sold and keep good personal hygiene and wash their hands."

[One of the key prerequisites for a non-human influenza virus to become pandemic is its transmissibility and fitness to spread from one human to the next. The potential for transmission of avian-origin influenza viruses directly to mammalian hosts and subsequently between human hosts is evaluated using murine (mouse) and ferret models. The findings of the study above on ferrets indicate that the H7N9 virus can be transmitted with distances as little as 7 cm between infected and contact animals.

Based on the data available thus far, A/H7N9 influenza virus does not appear to transmit easily from person to person, and sustained human-to-human transmission has not been reported. It is imperative that public advisories and communications highlight the risk for exposure to infected poultry as well as confirmed human cases of A/H7N9 avian influenza. - Mod.UBA]
