The Agriculture Ministry announced Friday [22 Jul 2016] that it is following up on a suspected outbreak of cowpox that was found in bovine in North Lebanon's Akkar. The ministry's Animal Resources Directorate said that it sent a team of veterinarians to assess the epidemic in the area by examining the cows, taking samples, and sending them to the labs. The team also checked on the origin of the affected cattle and gave farmers instructions on how to manage the issue. This comes as the "recent illegal movement of animals from Syrian areas near the Lebanese border has increased," a ministry statement said. "Lebanon has been officially declared free of this disease for more than 2 years after the Agriculture Ministry was able to control it following the 1st cases in 2013." The statement added that there was little cause for alarm. The virus is not highly contagious and requires direct contact with the infected animals to contract.

["Cowpox" is most probably a misnomer. The disease referred to should read lumpy skin disease (LSD). For a picture of an infected cow in Akkar, published in the Lebanese web-site "lebaneseinfo.com" on Sat, 23 Jul 2016 (in Arabic), see http://tinyurl.com/gst2bm7.

Lebanon reported an event of LSD which started 28 Nov 2012, caused -- reportedly -- a total of 34 outbreaks and was declared, according to a final report submitted 30 Jan 2014, "resolved" as of 18 Mar 2013.

For the location of Akkar, in North Lebanon adjacent to the Syrian border, see map at http://tinyurl.com/zf5ugdz. Confirmation of the diagnosis and its official notification are anticipated.

LSD is a Capripoxvirus.

Cowpox is an Orthopoxvirus, and is not an OIE-reportable disease. It is a mild, eruptive, zoonotic disease of dairy cows, restricted to udder and teats. It is currently less common than in the past, distributed widely in Europe, western parts of the former Soviet Union, and adjacent areas of Northern and Central Asia, with an increasing number of reports originating from Europe. Genome sequence analyses have revealed considerable diversity among isolates of cowpox virus. - Mod.AS
