Studies identify genetic markers for drug-resistant malaria
-----------------------------------------------------------
Two papers published last week [week of 3 Nov 2016] in The Lancet Infectious Diseases describe the identification of molecular markers associated with drug resistance in _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria.

The 2 papers were genome-wide association studies of Cambodian strains of _P. falciparum_ that were looking to find molecular markers for resistance to piperaquine, a drug that is used in artemisinin combination therapies. As malaria in the Greater Mekong subregion becomes increasingly resistant to artemisinin and the partner drugs that are used to treat the _P. falciparum_ parasite -- which accounts for most malaria cases and deaths -- molecular markers are urgently needed to help public health officials monitor the spread of resistance and recommend alternative treatments.

In addition to Cambodia, artemisinin resistance has been detected in Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

In one study [1], led by researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, investigators compared the complete genomes of 297 parasites isolated from Cambodian malaria patients to a reference malaria parasite genome and identified 2 genetic markers -- amplifications of the exo-E425G and plasmepsin 2 and 3 genes -- associated with the parasites' ability to resist piperaquine. The researchers believe that the amplification of the plasmepsin 2 and 3 genes may play a functional role in enabling parasites to resist piperaquine.

In the other study [2], researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia did a gene-wide association study on 31 malaria strains to define the resistant in-vitro phenotype. They found that an increased plasmepsin 2 gene copy number was strongly associated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine treatment failure.

"The converging results of these studies make plasmepsin 2-3 amplification a robust marker for piperaquine resistance in the region," an accompanying commentary notes [3]. "_P. falciparum_ transfected with multicopy plasmepsin 2-3 will be an invaluable tool to explore underlying resistance mechanisms."

Information about the distribution of these drug resistance markers, a press release from NIAID [4] explains, is being used by officials in Cambodia and neighboring countries to determine the spread of piperaquine resistance and help guide treatment approaches.

[The findings of the 2 studies are important because they open up for easy and rapid tests to detect resistance against piperaquine. Malaria in Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar is showing decreased susceptibility to the artemisinins which are combined with piperaquine. If the malaria parasite is resistant to piperaquine the combination will essentially be a monotherapy with artemisinins and that will facilitate development of resistance and also result in treatment failure. - Mod.EP]
