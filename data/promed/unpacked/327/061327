On 16 Aug 2006, 7 cases of acute intestinal infection were reported
to the Riga branch of the State Public Health Agency. All 7 patients
(3 Latvians and 4 Norwegians) had eaten at restaurant X in Riga 3
days before developing symptoms of acute diarrhea. One of the initial
cases was in a person who worked at the restaurant.
An epidemiological investigation was begun immediately in order to
determine the extent and cause of the outbreak and to identify risk
factors for infection using a retrospective cohort study. Information
about the outbreak was released to the media, inviting people who had
eaten at restaurant X to come forward for interview; 7 people who had
eaten at restaurant X responded to the media information, of which 4
had developed gastrointestinal symptoms.
A total of 48 people who had eaten at restaurant X between 11 and 17
Aug 2006 were interviewed (face to face or by telephone), including
restaurant workers and 17 tourists from Norway.
The following information was collected:
- Food items eaten at restaurant X by cases and by people who did not
become ill, and the times at which they were eaten and other relevant
information. All reported food items were compared with menus
supplied by restaurant X.
- Clinical and microbiological data relating to patients, including:
clinical signs; date and time of onset of symptoms; date that medical
attention was sought; date of admission to hospital, outcome of
microbiological investigations.
- Practices that may have facilitated the outbreak such as: risky
food preparation (mayonnaise prepared from raw eggs at restaurant X),
unhygienic product storage, exceeding shelf life, and other
violations of food handling hygiene requirements. 4 food specimens
and 18 surface swabs were microbiologically tested;
- Food-specific attack rates to identify possible vehicles of transmission.
The outbreak lasted from 12 to 17 Aug 2006 and peaked on 16 Aug 2006
[for figure, see original URL. - Mod.LL]; 23 cases were identified,
which were in adults aged between 19 and 60 years; 15 patients (65
percent) were female. The patients reported symptoms which included
diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever vomiting, headache, and nausea. The
mean duration of illness was 5 days; 15 patients, including 8
restaurant workers, were admitted to hospital. All recovered.
Stool specimens from 32 people, including 21 restaurant workers, were
microbiologically tested, and specimens from 16 people, including 8
restaurant workers, tested positive for _S. [enterica_ serotype]
Enteritidis. Of 48 people interviewed, 23 met the criteria for being
a probable or confirmed outbreak case (attack rate = 48 percent). No
secondary cases were detected among family members or other people
linked with cases that had been exposed via food from restaurant X.
Illness onset dates ranged from 12 to 17 Aug 2006. Stool specimens
from 32 people, including 21 restaurant workers, were
microbiologically tested. A total of 16 cases tested positive for
serotype Enteritidis var Jena, of which 8 were in workers at the
restaurant; 3 cases were also reported to be positive for norovirus
antigen (taking into account the circulation of norovirus in the
city, this fact was not considered for analysis, because norovirus
antigen is often detected in clinically healthy persons).
The analysis of food exposures revealed the salads with mayonnaise
prepared at restaurant X as the only food exposures that could cause
the illness, because 100 percent of those who reported having eaten
the salads fell ill:
- tuna salad (RR: 3.1; 95 percent CI 1.11-2.47; P value 0.02)
- bean salad (RR: 2.4; 95 percent CI 0.90-2.19; P value 0.15)
- Caesar salad (RR: 2.1; 95 percent CI 0.73-2.12; P value 0.44)
The following factors are considered to have facilitated the
occurrence of the outbreak: risky food preparation (mayonnaise
prepared from raw eggs), incorrect product storage, expired shelf
life, and other violations of hygiene requirements of commercial food
preparation.
Conclusions and measures:
The retrospective cohort study concluded that the outbreak was caused
by eating or handling the tuna, bean and Caesar salads with
mayonnaise prepared from raw eggs at restaurant X. The local food
control authority was informed of the outbreak, and restaurant X was
closed for cleaning on 18 Aug 2006.

[This is a more complete description of the Latvian outbreak
previously posted in August. With 95 percent confidence limits not
overlapping 1.0 and a p value less than 0.05, the tuna salad
statistically seems to be the most relevant vehicle.
