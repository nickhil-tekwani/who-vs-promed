The disease described by Dr B.O. Olugasa of the Dept of Vet Public Health
and Preventive Medicine, University of Ibadan, may be identical to a
disease that caused a series of mortalities in a nucleus pig farm in
Bingerville and other farms in the region, Cote d'Ivoire in 1992-1993. We
suspected Encephalomyocarditis Virus (EMCV) as the cause of the disease and
we confirmed it by virus isolation and serology. Evidence of virus
circulation was also detected in rodents. Only 6 of 34 sera collected in
the _Rattus rattus_ species trapped in Daloa area were found positive with
titre higher than 80; all sera collected in other species were found
negative with a titre lower than 10.

[The results of the lab work-ups on these dead pigs
a) Giemsa staining of blood samples showed rod-shaped organisms with
central, subterminal, and terminal darker spots within. About 106 such
bacilli were counted in a typical field under x100 magnification objective
lens. Blood cells show characteristics of septicemia.
b) Postmortem shows enlarged spleen and friable swollen lymph nodes.
[Yves Leforban's comments were passed to Tayo Babalobi for comment:
The link to EMCV is interesting and raises the possibility of the
outbreak's being related to a case of sudden mortality of a mangabey monkey
with similar symptoms as the pigs' that occurred at the zoological garden
of the University of Ibadan in June 2001. I was on duty on 6 May 2001 at the
zoo, when my attention was called to an adult mangabey monkey that was
weak, anorexic, and bleeding from the nose and mouth. Since it was with
another mangabey monkey in its cage, it was assumed they must have attacked
one another, although the attendants stated they do not usually fight.
While [we were trying to lure its mate into a side enclosure so that the
sick monkey could be restrained for closer examination, the sick monkey, in
attempting to jump to a height of about one meter, slumped and died, with
unclotted blood flowing from its mouth and nostrils.
Since there was no evidence of physical injury, we decided to send the
carcass for postmortem at the veterinary pathology department of the
University's veterinary faculty. The postmortem report showed severe
pulmonary haemorrhages and congestion, vegetative endocarditis,
degenerative myopathy, hepatic fibrositis, and haemorrhagic
gastroenteritis. The tentative diagnosis then was congestive heart failure
(of unknown cause). Microbiological examination demonstrated staphylococci
and _Listeria_ organisms.
In the previous month, there had been 3 sudden deaths in baby gorillas in
the same zoo. They were thought to be unrelated to the mangabey case, as
enteritis and impaction were shown [to be present, while _Yersinia_ and
coagulase-positive _Staphylococcus_ and _E.coli_ organisms were
demonstrated in one [baby gorilla subjected to [postmortem
microbiological examination.
Noting that the case in the mangabey monkey occurred just at the onset of
outbreak in the pigs, could there be a possible link between the two? Any
other information on definitive diagnosis will be appreciated.
