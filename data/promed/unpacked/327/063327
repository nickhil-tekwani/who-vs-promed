The following summarizes the available information relating to the outbreak
of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections and hemolytic uremic syndrome complications
resulting from contaminated drinking water in Walkerton, Ontario.
15 May 2000: Earliest date that health officials think the Walkerton
drinking water supply could have been contaminated.
16 May 2000: First child reported ill.
18 May 2000: First positive test for _E. coli_ contamination by Walkerton
Water Co.
21 May 2000: Health officials began testing of water because of
observations of increased hospital admissions.
26 May 2000: 5 fatalities and approximately 600 persons treated for related
symptoms.
28 May 2000: At 6:00 AM EDT, London Health Sciences Centre reports:
13 patients currently hospitalized
4 children and 1 adult currently in critical care units
5 patients undergoing treatment by dialysis
At the present time, the outbreak appears to be waning as a result of
official warnings to boil drinking water and adjustments at water treatment
facilities. No confirmation of the source of the contamination is
available as yet, but contamination of the water supply with animal feces
after a period of heavy rains and flooding is suspected.
