How interesting. Is there any info regarding the viability of a one
day (I assume) course of tetracycline as a prophylactic regimen
against cholera or are they just going to create another drug-
resistant strain of bacteria?

[Single dose doxycycline has been used to *treat* cholera, although
resistance to tetracyclines is a significant problem. Ciprofloxacin
(the prototype quinolone) has been used with success as well.
Reference: Lancet 1996 Aug 3;348(9023):296-300
Randomised controlled comparison of single-dose ciprofloxacin
and doxycycline for cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae O1 or O139.

Prophylaxis is a separate issue. Steve Berger has written that it
might be contemplated in certain situations, but is not advocated as
a general approach to prevention of cholera among travelers.
Single dose antibiotic prophylaxis has been used more generally to
prevent traveler's diarrhea which, of course, may have multiple
causes.
