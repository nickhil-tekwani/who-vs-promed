The death toll from an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the Netherlands
has risen to 16, the Dutch health ministry said at the weekend.
A preliminary investigation has traced the source of the outbreak to a
whirlpool bath at a flower show, the ministry has said.
In addition to the deaths, nearly 200 people are suffering from the disease
after exposure to the bacteria, the health ministry said.
