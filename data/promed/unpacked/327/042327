The number of children hospitalized with food poisoning rose to 75 on
Sat 18 Aug 2007 in the city of Blagodarny, Stavropol Territory. An
adult was hospitalized with the same diagnosis.
Another 48 children are being treated at home, visiting the
outpatient department. The total number of people, suffering from
food poisoning, has already reached 124 (including the adult),
Itar-Tass learned at the Stavropol branch of the Russian Ministry for
Emergencies.
Children became ill on Thu 17 Aug 2007. Each of them started
vomiting, had high temperature up to 39 deg C (102.2 deg F) and a
headache. According to doctors, the [condition of the hospitalized]
ranges from moderate to serious.
All affected children are from various city kindergartens. The adult
is a kindergarten cook.
It was established that the use of substandard foodstuffs was the
reason for the event. Investigation is now in progress to track down
the origin of outdated foods. It is quite probable that taking into
account the long hot spell that set in the Stavropol Territory, the
firm that purchased and distributed foods to pre-school children
establishments failed to store foodstuffs under proper conditions.

[An epidemic curve is needed (cases versus time) to assess if the
process was a one time exposure with or without secondary cases or a
continuous one. The etiology of the episode is not yet clear and is
likely to be viral or bacterial in origin. The illness in a single
chef could reflect another who ingested some of the implicated food
or the index case (if the chef was the one who prepared food, which
was then distributed to other schools.
