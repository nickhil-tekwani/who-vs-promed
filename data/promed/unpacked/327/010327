With the identification of two additional cases of Equine Infectious Anemia
(EIA) in the state, the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services is reminding horse owners of the importance of the Coggins test as
a means of preventing the spread of the disease.
The latest cases were found in Russell and Clark counties and bring to 3
the total number of occurrences of the disease in Virginia during 1999.
Earlier in the year, an EIA-positive horse was found in Carroll County.
EIA is a viral disease of horses for which there is no preventive vaccine
and no known cure. The Coggins test determines the presence of EIA through
an accurate and reliable blood test. Wide usage of the test during recent
years has reduced the incidence of this equine disease which is spread
mechanically from infected to healthy horses by biting flies or
contaminated instruments such as hypodermic needles.
"For the protection of your horse, the investment you have in it, and the
health of other horses, we strongly recommend owners test their own animals
for EIA and make sure horses coming in contact with yours have also been
tested," said Dr. Robert Whiting, the Department's Veterinary Program
Coordinator. "For instance, when choosing a boarding stable, select one
requiring Coggins tests for all animals at the facility. When you buy
horses, make sure they have been tested and found to be free of any
evidence of EIA before you complete the sale."
State regulations require that all horses participating in an event such as
a show, fair, race, meet or trail ride in Virginia must be accompanied by a
report of an official negative Coggins test conducted within the previous
12 months. Regulations also require in Virginia, all horses sold or
auctioned through a livestock market, except those sold for slaughter, must
be tested for EIA. For horses that come from out of state, Virginia
regulations require a negative Coggins test and a health certificate
accompany these horses when entering Virginia. It is in the Virginia
buyer's best interest to make sure these requirements are met in order to
protect their new investment and not introduce disease among other horses
they may own.
In one of the new cases, the horse had recently been in contact with more
than 250 other horses through participation in several trail rides. The
disease was found when the owner attempted to qualify the horse for a
subsequent ride. The other case was discovered when the horse was sold.
