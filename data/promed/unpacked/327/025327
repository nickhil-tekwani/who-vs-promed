BSE & V-CJD, POSSIBLE LINK

NEW POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN BSE AND V-CJD REPORTED
French government scientists reported on June 13 that they have found
the first experimental evidence of a possible link between bovine
spongiform encephalopathy and V-CJD.
The study, by the two neurologists Dr. Corinne Lasmezas and Dr.
Jean-Philippe Deslys, will be published in Nature. The result shows
striking similarities between brain lesions in monkeys injected with the
crushed brains of cows infected with BSE, and the new human form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, V-CJD.
The researchers have compared their results with British V-CJD cases. The
brain lesions were "very close, strikingly similar" and "a first
experimental argument for a causal link between the bovine illness and the
new form of CJD in the British patients", said Dr. Deslys. The lesions were
flower-shaped patches surrounded by cavities.

I have not seen the paper and nor has anyone else. It is due to be
published on 27 June.
If the press reports of the press conference called by the CEA in
Paris are correct, it is important new evidence that will need to be
evaluated for the possibility of a BSE/V-CJD link.
Meanwhile, the following copy of the Nature Press Release will be of
interest:-
NATURE PRESS RELEASE -- BSE IN MONKEYS
June 13/96
Following a press conference held in France this morning (13 June)
concerning new results on the transmission of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, Nature is issuing the following statement.
This statement refers to a paper reporting that, following inoculation
with BSE cattle-brain homogenate, macaque monkeys developed
pathological features in their brains similar to those exhibited by
human sufferers of a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD),
reported by R G Will and others in The Lancet earlier this year. The
authors of the paper are listed below.
While the paper was under consideration, we were informed that the
Commisariat a l'Energie Atomique, the institution associated with six
of the papers' co-authors, had arranged the press conference that was
held this morning in Paris, presenting a summary of the results. There
are a number of points arising from this that we wish to make.
The decision of the CEA to hold a press conference before publication
of the paper seems to us to be highly regrettable. As has happened
before in the BSE crisis, the public are being alerted to developments
of scientific and political significance before the essential
scientific facts have reached the public domain.
Second, having undertaken all our normal procedures for assessing and
revising the paper, we have decided that we should publish it. It will
appear in the issue of 27th June in our Scientific Correspondence
section. (We received the paper on 6 June 1996, and it was accepted on
12 June 1996). The fact that we are publishing these results as
Scientific Correspondence, and not as a Letter to Nature, is a
reflection of our judgement, based on referees' comments, that the
full significance of these observations has yet to be established,
though the observations themselves are of great interest.
Any questions relating to the content of this paper should be
addressed to the authors [listed below. MHJ].
