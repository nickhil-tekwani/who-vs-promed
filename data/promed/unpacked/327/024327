reported in November 2005 (see Disease Information 2005; 18[46]: 445, 18

[As a reminder, maps are almost always attached to the Office International
des Epizooties' World Animal Health Information Ddatabase (WAHID) reports
now. In this case it is a very instructive illustration because the disease
has spread to 5 sites in the southern part of the country, near the Persian
Gulf, over the past week. Note that the original outbreak at the Kuwait Zoo
occurred in the middle of January 2007.
In this case, vaccination of non-affected species was the control tactic
chosen by the zoo animal health authorities. Of course, managing an
outbreak at a zoo, particularly if endangered species are present, is a
complicated decision tree -- see moderator comments for ProMED-mail
posting: Avian influenza - Asia (28): Indonesia, zoo birds 20050919.2768.
It would be valuable to know what vaccine strain was used and whether
adequate protection was achieved over all zoo species in the collection.
This information is especially valuable since there is no indication of
quarantine for the zoo birds, so exposure to people would be an unfortunate
possibility should protective immunity not be fully realized. - Mod.PC]
