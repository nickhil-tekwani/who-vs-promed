Amid the raging debate over cow slaughter, Russia has banned buffalo meat imports from India after its observers found foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] virus in a consignment. According to sources, Russia had earlier this year [2015] decided to import buffalo meat from India following prolonged talks and inspection of meat processing units in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.

"The decision will hit at least 3 meat processing units in Aligarh, Barabanki, and Rampur in Uttar Pradesh and another unit in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. Russian inspectors found the virus in the meat during examination of consignments and immediately took the decision to stop import from these units," the sources said.

They added that the government has asked these units to ensure that such lapses do not recur.

The government has laid down standards for export of meat, which include standards for abattoir, processing plants, and for various meat products.

As per the existing policy, each export consignment is subjected to compulsory microbiological and other tests and a comprehensive pre-shipment inspection is issued by the government veterinarian.

India is the world's largest beef exporter -- which is actually buffalo meat, not cow meat. Meat of cow, oxen, and calf is prohibited under the foreign trade policy for export. The figure related to buffalo meat exports in the financial year 2014-15 shows growth of 10 per cent with total exports touching 29 282 crore [1 crore = 10 million].

But, the latest figure released by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) says buffalo meat exports between April-August 2015 have gone down by 8.82 per cent.

The APEDA, which comes under the Ministry of Commerce, says in April-August 2014-15, India exported 535 299 MTs [metric tons] of buffalo meat, earning 10 382 crore. However, this year during the same period, India's buffalo meat export was only 4,68,381 MTs, which earned the country a total of 9466 crore.

[FMD is endemic in India. OIE's International Animal Health Code addresses all official conditions for international trade in relation to Infection with FMD virus in its chapter 8.8, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_fmd.htm.

For the purposes of international trade in animals and their products, and according to resolution no. 18 endorsed by OIE's 83rd General Session of World Assembly (Paris, May 2015), India is recognised as one of 8 OIE member countries with the status "countries with endorsed official control programme for FMD." The other countries currently recognised as having this status are Algeria, Bolivia, China (People's Rep. of), Ecuador, Morocco, Namibia, and Venezuela.

According to article 8.8.22 of the said chapter, the following recommendations are stipulated for the veterinary requirements related to the import of fresh meat of cattle and water buffaloes (_Bubalus bubalis_) (excluding feet, head, and viscera) from "countries or zones where an official control programme exists":

"Veterinary authorities should require the presentation of an international veterinary certificate attesting that the entire consignment of meat:
1. comes from animals which:
a. have remained, for at least 3 months prior to slaughter, in a zone of the exporting country where cattle and water buffaloes are regularly vaccinated against FMD and where an official control programme is in operation;
b. have been vaccinated at least twice with the last vaccination not more than 6 months, unless protective immunity has been demonstrated for more than 6 months, and not less than one month prior to slaughter;
c. were kept for the past 30 days in an establishment, and that FMD has not occurred within a 10 kilometre [6.2 mi] radius of the establishment during that period, or the establishment is a quarantine station;
d. have been transported, in a vehicle which was cleansed and disinfected before the cattle and water buffaloes were loaded, directly from the establishment of origin or quarantine station to the approved slaughterhouse/abattoir without coming into contact with other animals which do not fulfill the required conditions for export;
e. have been slaughtered in an approved slaughterhouse/abattoir:
i. which is officially designated for export;
ii. in which no FMD has been detected during the period between the last disinfection carried out before slaughter and the shipment for export has been dispatched;
f. have been subjected to ante- and post-mortem inspections within 24 hours before and after slaughter with no evidence of FMD;

2. comes from deboned carcasses:
a. from which the major lymphatic nodes have been removed;
b. which, prior to deboning, have been submitted to maturation at a temperature greater than + 2 deg C [35.6 deg F] for a minimum period of 24 hours following slaughter and in which the pH value was less than 6.0 when tested in the middle of both the longissimus dorsi muscle"

The detailed procedure and conditions for a member country to get recognised as "a country with an OIE endorsed official control programme for FMD" are detailed in article 8.8.39. Before being discussed for final endorsement by the General Session, the applications and accompanying documentation of candidates are examined by OIE's specialist commissions. Recently, Tunisia's earlier recognition has been revoked following an outbreak of FMD.

The overall objective of an OIE endorsed official control programme for FMD is for countries to progressively improve the situation and eventually attain FMD free status. The official control programme should be applicable to the entire country even if certain measures are directed towards defined subpopulations only.

Member Countries may, on a voluntary basis, apply for endorsement of their official control programme for FMD when they have implemented measures in accordance with the said article 8.8.39.

India, ranked the world's leading beef exporter, is followed on the list by Brazil, Australia, USA, and New Zealand (see 2015 estimates, based upon USDA statistics, at http://www.indexmundi.com/agriculture/?commodity=beef-and-veal-meat&graph=exports). Australia, USA, and New Zealand have the status of "Member Countries recognised as FMD free where vaccination is not practiced." Brazil includes one "FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised" (State of Santa Catarina, recognised in February 2007), and 4 "FMD free zones where vaccination is practised."

The tests said to have been applied by the Russian authorities in consignment(s) of buffalo (boneless?) meat imported from India, and their reported positive results, if officially confirmed, may become of serious concern to India's beef exporters. Information on the said tests performed and of the FMD virus strain allegedly identified, are requested. - Mod.AS
