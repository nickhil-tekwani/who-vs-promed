["West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can affect birds, humans, and horses causing inapparent infection, mild febrile illness, meningitis, encephalitis, or death. West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the genus _Flavivirus_ in the family Flaviviridae. The arbovirus is maintained in nature by cycling through birds and mosquitoes; numerous avian and mosquito species support virus replication. For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans.

"The occurrence of disease in humans and animals along with bird and mosquito surveillance for WNV activity demonstrate that the virus range has dramatically expanded including North, Central, and South America as well as Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf)

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), noted between (Fri 14 and Thu 20 Sep 2018), EU Member States reported 186 human West Nile virus infections: Italy (92), Greece (32), Romania (33), Hungary (12), Croatia (11), Austria (2), Slovenia (2), and Bulgaria (2). This week, no human cases were reported by EU neighboring countries.

"In 6 areas, human cases were reported for the first time: Croatia (2), Slovenia (2), Italy (1), and Greece (1). All other human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons.

"This week, 25 deaths were reported by Italy (14), Romania (6), and Greece (5). In the same week, 12 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (6), Hungary (5), and Austria (1).

"In 2018, as of 20 Sep 2018, EU Member States have reported 1134 human cases: Italy (453), Greece (224), Romania (216), Hungary (167), Croatia (36), France (16), Austria (15), Bulgaria (4), and Slovenia (3). EU neighboring countries reported 370 human cases: Serbia (286), Israel (81), and Kosovo (3). To date, 115 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Italy (35), Serbia (29), Romania (25), Greece (24), Hungary (1), and Kosovo (1).

"During the current transmission season, 175 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (98), Hungary (63), Greece (9), France (2), Romania (2), and Austria (1).

"In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should defer for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of West Nile virus circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative."
