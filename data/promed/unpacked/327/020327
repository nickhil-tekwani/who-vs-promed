Mizoram Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Department officials today [8 Aug
2009] said that at least 1000 pigs have died of the fever in Lunglei,
Lawngtlai, and Kolasib districts.

The alert was sounded after a review of the situation at a high-level
meeting chaired by chief minister Manik Sarkar last night [7 Aug 2009]. The
sources said Sarkar instructed the officials to remain prepared to prevent
the outbreak of the disease.

"Seven observation centres have been set up at strategic entry points to
the state," director of preventive medicine R K Dhar said today [8 Aug 2009].
