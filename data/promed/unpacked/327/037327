The program presents clinical guidelines and procedures for the early
recognition, diagnosis, treatment, and reporting of anthrax exposure. A
panel of experts from the CDC provides an overview of clinical, laboratory
and public health preparedness for potential _Bacillus anthracis_
incidence. Sponsored by the American Hospital Assn., American Medical
Assn., Public Health Training Network, CDC, and the University of North
Carolina School of Public Health.
CDC PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS & RESPONSE

From: Phillip A. Brewer, MD <Phillip.Brewer@YALE.EDU>

My hospital set up a room and accessed the satellite link. The program was
fairly comprehensive with little information that isn't already available on
several websites. The salient points for me were:
1. One can use ciprofloxacin or doxycycline in adult or pediatric cases,
although the precautions of use in children must be considered.
Ciprofloxacin was not presented as having any superiority to doxycycline.
2. In the event of another outbreak with a need to administer PEP to large
numbers of people, the CDC can mobilize both medications and personnel and
have them onsite and ready to go in under 12 hours.
3. The program emphasized the importance of primary providers as sentinels
in uncovering new cases. They repeatedly praised the physician in Florida
who put two and two together and ordered an anthrax stain of the biopsy
from the index case and thus established the diagnosis. There would likely
have been more deaths otherwise. [We all owe Larry Bush a great vote of
thanks for his clinical acumen. - Mod.MHJ
4. Front-line clinicians should not order nasal swaps or serology on
suspected cases. Anthrax grows readily in usual culture media, in
particular sheep's blood agar, and most clinical labs can also stain biopsy
material for anthrax. Nasal swabs and serology should only be done by
public health personnel who are conducting mass screenings of possible
contacts of a confirmed case. This establishes a uniform screening standard
and database.
5. Contrary to instructions coming from some officials, suspicious material
should not be placed in a plastic bag. The person who is handling it should
tell anyone else nearby to stay clear. The material should immediately be
placed on a flat surface such as a desk or the floor. An inverted trash can
may be slowly placed over it to prevent further scattering. 911 and the
building manager should then be notified.
