We saw an occurrence in Norway (years ago, probably around 1995-1996)
at an abattoir where I was working as a vet in meat inspection where a
total of 6 cows were brought in showing non-specific signs of disease
like those described in this outbreak. It turned out they were dying
of botulism, the source of the toxin being in the silage (fermented
grass) they were fed. You sometimes get sources of nutrient for the
bacteria in with the grass, and the anaerobic conditions and
temperatures in the ensilage will allow _Clostridium botulinum_
growth.

It might be worth checking the feed.

[Dr Per Leines Lausund's commentary is welcomed.

Indeed, "passivity," if interpreted as paresis or paralysis, followed
by death after 2 days, as the cases were described in the cited
newswire, is reminiscent of botulism and deserves to be included in
the DD list.

The characteristic clinical sign of botulism is generalised flaccid
paralysis. Reduction in tongue tone is generally considered the most
characteristic sign (pull tongue out of side of mouth and let go; the
animal will not pull it back in cases of botulism).

In addition to ensilaged grass as a potential source of the toxin,
feeding with poultry manure has been incriminated as the source in
many outbreaks in cattle (see postings 20020618.4531, 20030701.1623, 20061208.3463).

It will be interesting to note whether this suggested diagnosis has
been included in the investigation hopefully undertaken in Nepal. -
