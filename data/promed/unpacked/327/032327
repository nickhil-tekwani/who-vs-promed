The Allegheny County Health Department is warning residents to avoid
contact with raccoons, other wildlife and stray dogs and cats because of a
growing rabies outbreak.
Two rabid animals found this week bring the total in the county so far this
year to 8, compared to just 1 reported by this time in 1999. The new cases
are a stray cat in Kilbuck and a raccoon in Troy Hill.
The earlier cases were all raccoons found in scattered areas of the county.
A 28-year-old man bitten by a cat is undergoing treatment with rabies
vaccine and is not expected to develop the disease. There was no human
exposure in the other new case, but a dog which fought with a raccoon was
given a booster shot and is under a 3-month quarantine.
Health officials say the incident involving the stray cat shows why it's
important not to touch a strange animal, especially a cat or a dog which
appears homeless. These animals are vulnerable to attack from rabid
raccoons and may carry the rabies virus, even when they look healthy.
The rabies virus is transmitted through a bite, scratch or opening in the
skin exposed to saliva from a rabies-infected animal. Wear rubber gloves
when handling your pet after it has been exposed, wash it thoroughly with
soap and water and call your veterinarian for treatment advice.
When a person is exposed to an animal's saliva, cleanse the area with soap
and water and seek medical attention.
Pet owners are advised to keep their dog or cat up to date with its rabies
shots. State law requires rabies shots at regular intervals, depending on
the age of the pet and the type of vaccine.
