Tonga measles outbreak situation report from government of Tonga as at 17 Jan 2020

1. Summary of Situation
Background

The outbreak of measles in Tonga began in early October 2019, following the return of a national youth team of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand. The index case developed measles while in New Zealand. Subsequently, a further 12 teammates developed laboratory-confirmed measles. The early outbreak involved mainly teenagers from associated schools on Tongatapu and Vava'u Islands. Since the initial 2 waves of the outbreak, cases were widely reported in all age groups but are now waning.

An interdisciplinary Ministry of Health epidemic task force (ETF) meets weekly to advise on management of the outbreak. In addition to routine outbreak response activities, a time-limited vaccination program targeting secondary school students and 6-11-month infants has been completed.

Note: Refer to earlier sit reps for further detail of the initial cases and response.

2. Current Situation
There is ongoing transmission on the Islands of Tongatapu and Vava'u; the last case onsets on Ha'apai, 'Eua, and Niuatoputapu islands were 14 Dec 2019, 8 Dec 2019, 14 Nov 2019, respectively [Table 1]. Since the last situation report, 6 new measles case-patients were reported in Tongatapu, and 3 cases were added retrospectively to the cumulative number of cases. They were 7 males and 2 females between the ages of 6 months and 19 years old.

As of 16 Jan 2020, 639 confirmed or suspected cases of measles have been identified in Tonga including 52 lab-confirmed cases. The majority, 561 (87.8%) cases, have occurred on Tongatapu, and 66 (10.3 %) have occurred on Vava'u Island. Case presentations have been reported to be mild with 20 hospitalisations and no death. The majority of the cases have been managed by home isolation, and all patients have been discharged. Given the duration of illness is typically less than 2 weeks, it is estimated that at least 99% of the 639 reported measles cases will have already recovered from their illnesses.

Figure 1 (see URL) shows the epidemic curve for the current outbreak in Tonga. Most of the cases (blue) were reported from the Island of Tongatapu.

Figure 2 demonstrates the breakdown of cases by gender. Consistent with early transmission through male boarding schools, most cases have been among males, with the proportion of cases among females increasing as the outbreak progressed. A total of 105 cases have occurred in children aged less than 5 years, while cases among adolescents and young people continue to form the majority of the cases in this outbreak (500 cases, 78%, occurring in people aged 10-24 years) (Table 2 and Figure 3).

[2] Samoa: measles death toll rising
Date: Thu 30 Jan 2020
Source: Kealaka'i [abridged, edited]
https://kealakai.byuh.edu/measles-death-toll-in-samoa-rising-due-to-anti-vaccination-sentiment-according-to-byuh-professors


Measles continues to spread like wildfire through Samoa, with about 50 cases being reported per day, according to the official Government of Samoa Twitter. The number of dead, as of 14 Dec [2019] is 72, with more than 5200 people sick. Most of the dead are children. BYU-Hawaii professors said much of the problem comes from low vaccination rates, caused by fear and misinformation being spread throughout the Pacific.

Colby Weeks, assistant professor of science, added, "There are thousands of people who are horribly sick and going to the hospitals, putting a massive strain on the healthcare system. This is imminently avoidable because of the healthcare system. Headlines always say deaths, but there is a lot more going on than those individuals. Pick the easiest route and get vaccinated."

Line Kruse, a special instructor, explained the situation is occurring all across Oceania, but it is worst in Samoa. "There is an epidemic in Samoa. There have also been measles reported by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in New Zealand, Australia, Tonga, and Fiji.

"It has been declared a state of emergency in the Kingdom of Tonga, the Republic of the Fiji Islands, and Samoa. Samoa, however, is the only country in Oceania, as of this entire year [2019], that has this many reported deaths."

Akanoa shared the death toll is so high in Samoa because their vaccination rate is much lower than the other Pacific Islands. "This is due to a lack of understanding with parents about how important it is to vaccinate your children. There are still people out there who don't believe in vaccination. With this outbreak, we know it is the only solution."

According to one NPR article, the vaccination rate dropped from 58% in 2018 to 31% in 2019. The situation has become urgent, and unvaccinated homes are being marked with red flags as part of a mass door-to-door vaccination campaign by the government.

"People also rely heavily on their faith," shared Akanoa. "When things like this happen, they have this really great faith Heavenly Father will not let anything worse happen. When children started dying, they finally realize that maybe God wants them to do something about it."

Kruse said, "The government of Samoa has gone through several series of responses to the measles epidemic. They started to mandate vaccinations, but as of 5 and 6 Dec [2019], they have shut down the government. They have shut down roads. They have shut down public gatherings."

One purpose of the government shutdown, said Akanoa, is because "all the government workers in the public sector are going out to help with vaccinations and to assist families."

The biggest argument of anti-vaccination supporters in Oceania, or anti-vaxxers, according to Kruse, is that vaccinations made in India, which is where most Oceanic countries get their vaccinations, are lower quality than European-made vaccines.

"The anti-vaxxers are trying to create this false narrative that [vaccines] from India are bad for you, which is very Eurocentric and downright racist ... It is reckless because there are no scientific journals that validate any deaths attributed to manufacture vaccines from India," she explained.

One anti-vaxxer on Twitter wrote, "Talking with friends. Most are pro-vax, but none of them want to harm their children with this Indian vaccine. People are really going to be hiding their children in the attic to protect them from the government." He attached a screenshot of a text saying, "I'd rather infect my kids with measles than inject them with those cheap Indian vaccines."

The anti-vaccination sentiment came right on the heels of a tragic mix-up in vaccines in Samoa in 2018, said both Akanoa and Kruse. The vaccine, which is supposed to be mixed with water, was combined with muscle relaxer by 2 nurses in Samoa, explained Kruse. Two young children were killed.

"Parents were afraid to take their kids to get the vaccination," shared Akanoa. "[Parents] hear horror stories and freak out."

According to Kruse, another unfortunate side effect of disasters like this is that charlatans, or people who use deception to obtain money from people, begin to appear. One such man, Fritz Alai'asa, showed up during the measles epidemic.

"A man has come into Samoa and set up shop," she shared. "Kangen water is what he had said is going to cure them. 'Pay me 10 tala [WST 10 / USD 3.68]. Bring your family,' he says. So, the family comes, and he gets this Kangen water, this alkaline water, and he sprinkles it on them."

Health officials in American Samoa say 3 more people have been confirmed to have contracted measles. Tests in Hawaii laboratories confirmed the disease in a 27-year-old woman and 2 boys, aged 12 years and 6 months, respectively.

The latest results raise the territory's confirmed measles cases to 15.

Despite mass vaccinations last month [December 2019], a doctor said there were still children seen at the hospital for other medical reasons who had not yet been vaccinated.

Health officials said they were continuing vaccinations throughout this week.

Joint WHO-UNICEF statement on Pacific measles situation as of 20 Jan 2020: effective outbreak response reduces the risk of measles spread in the Pacific
----------------------------------------------------------
In 2019, the Pacific saw the re-emergence of measles, with outbreaks declared in Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and American Samoa and cases reported in Kiribati. For Samoa, the country experienced a widescale measles outbreak that had significant impact upon the country's population and health system. The disease has cost lives, with infants and young children being most affected.

In response to the identification of measles in the region, many Pacific countries and areas have made serious efforts to close immunity gaps in their population and strengthen infectious disease prevention, surveillance, and response systems. These efforts align to the core public health capacities required by all countries under the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, and are critical to preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases, such as measles.

The governments of Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji have conducted vaccination campaigns aimed at closing immunity gaps in their populations to stop the transmission of the virus. These immunization activities are bringing the outbreaks under control. In Samoa, the mass immunization campaign, which targeted individuals aged 6 months to 60 years, achieved 95% vaccination coverage, the rate needed to prevent measles transmission in a population. Fiji and Tonga continue immunizing those most at risk of measles to meet the target of 95% and ensure that populations are protected. Other Pacific countries and areas have also conducted supplementary immunization activities to reduce the risk of potential measles outbreaks.

Due to the public health efforts of Pacific countries and areas, the risk of measles spreading in Samoa and in other Pacific Island countries and areas has notably reduced.

WHO, UNICEF, and other partners continue to work closely with Pacific health authorities to respond to new measles cases, strengthen their systems to ensure the rapid detection and response to cases, and increase and sustain high immunization coverage rates for all vaccine-preventable diseases.
Additionally, technical collaboration continues to ensure that all have strong health emergency management systems in place at all times.

WHO recommends that all individuals exercise standard health precautions when travelling abroad. In the Pacific, all individuals travelling between Pacific Island countries and areas, or to and from the Pacific, are strongly advised to ensure they are up to date with their vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to departing. Travelers should consult with their health provider about their immunization status and other health needs prior to departure.

Cases of suspected mumps rocketed in Lancashire last year [2019].

In 2019, 314 suspected cases were reported in the area to Public Health England (PHE). That's almost triple the 120 suspected cases in 2018.

It is also the highest number since comparable records began in 2011. The figures include 64 suspected cases in West Lancashire, 32 in Lancaster, 31 in Preston, and 30 in Blackpool.

The area also saw 30 suspected cases of measles last year [2019], the same number as in 2018. Doctors are required to report any suspected cases of certain infectious diseases to their local authority or local health protection team, although not all cases will be confirmed.

Since mid-2018, a massive measles outbreak has been ravaging through the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The outbreak has turned into the biggest measles outbreak of the past 10 years in DRC and the biggest currently active worldwide.

Over 310 000 people have been infected and more than 6000 have died over the past year alone; 3/4 of those who have died are children. All 26 provinces of the country have been affected by the outbreak.

MSF teams are working in various areas of DRC to participate to the response; at different times over the past 2 years, they have been active in patient care, vaccination campaigns to prevent the spread of the disease, and surveillance activities to identify new areas of the epidemic and start the intervention as early as possible.

Our teams have set up dedicated facilities such as the laboratory opened at the end of 2019 in Lumbubashi, southeastern DRC, in order to ensure a faster, more effective turnaround of lab analyses.

During the last year in the current measles outbreak in DRC:

- 310 000 people have been infected with measles
- 6000 people have died
- 75% of those who have died are children

[See video at URL: Tackling the world's biggest measles outbreak: MSF responds in Kongo Central; byline: Solen Mourlon/MSF]

An MSF team is currently working in the province of Kongo Central, one of the main hotspots of the epidemic today. Our response in this area began in December 2019 and has been targeting the health zones where the highest numbers of cases of measles have been reported.

The team is providing care for complicated cases in dedicated treatment centres, supporting local health centres to deal with non-complicated cases, contributing to surveillance, and facilitating transfers of patients to healthcare facilities.

Some of the main challenges we face are the complications linked with associated diseases (such as malaria or malnutrition), which increase the risk of mortality, and gaining access to remote, hard-to-reach areas.
