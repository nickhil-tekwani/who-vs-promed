About 8900 broiler ducks at 2 farms in Yunlin County's Dounan Township are to be culled, while a suspected H5N2 infection was reported at
farms in Tainan and Chiayi County on Monday [14 Sep 2015].

Ducks at the Yunlin farms on Monday were found to have contracted a new type of the highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu virus, the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said.

The bureau said that it would perform precautionary culls at the farms even though the animals were generally in good health.

The farms are unenclosed facilities within a 1km radius of a previously affected farm, but the ducks to be culled might have been exposed to the virus through interaction with migratory birds, the bureau said.

It is clear that the virus is still active in the areas, the bureau said, adding that it would conduct disinfection operations and take samples from all facilities within a 1km radius of all affected farms.

Operators who refuse inspections face a fine of between NTD 30 000 and NTD 150 000 (USD 915 and USD 4575), while those who fail to report irregular deaths of fowls face a maximum fine of NTD 1 million [USD 30 800], it said.

Ducks are a carrier of the virus, but show few symptoms and have a low mortality rate, the bureau said, adding that while the native H5N2 viruses only infects chickens, not waterfowl, the new H5N2 viruses are more powerful strains that can infect geese and ducks.

Separately, a farm in Tainan with about 1800 geese and a farm in Chiayi with about 1200 broiler ducks reported irregular deaths of hundreds of fowl to authorities on Monday, with tests done and the results given to the bureau for examination. A report on the results is expected today [Wed, 16 Sep 2015].

As of Monday, the Council of Agriculture had tested samples from 986 farms nationwide and confirmed bird flu infection at 953 farms, culling animals at all 953 facilities, the bureau said.

To control the spread of avian influenza, in June 2015 the council announced that affected farms could resume poultry operations only after the facility is renovated to an enclosed or non-open structure, with the rules to take effect in 2016.

[At present, 3 different HPAI serotypes are known to circulate on Taiwan's territory, namely H5N2 (2 separate events), H5N3, and H5N8. Their respective epizootics are considered by the OIE as "continuing." Their history and other details, with respect to each of the 3 serotypes involved, are laid out in the commentary to posting 20150827.3606508.

The 2 new outbreaks described in the current media report seem to belong to the major H5N2 epizootic which started in Taiwan in January 2015. As of 4 Sep 2015, 534 outbreaks have been reported in 33 follow-up reports. The following epidemiological commentary was submitted to the OIE during the intial stages of the epizootic:

"Abnormal mortalities in 4 goose farms in Yun-Lin County and an acute egg drop syndrome in a layer duck farm in Ping-Tung County were noticed early January 2015. Local disease control center staff went to these farms to conduct movement restrictions and clinical inspection and then sent dead geese and layer ducks samples to the National Laboratory for diagnosis. Specific RNA product of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N2 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza strain was confirmed by the National Laboratory based on sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. It is worth noting that H and N genes of these isolates are different from the H5N2 strains previously isolated in Taiwan. The homology of H5 between the isolates from these infected farms and the South Korea 2014 H5N8 strain is near 99 percent. The homology of N2 between the isolates from these infected farms and the China 2011 H5N2 strain is 96 percent. This H5N2 strain is obviously novel to Taiwan. All the geese and ducks on the infected farm will be culled. The actual number of culled geese and ducks will be available when stamping out will finish and be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after the stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months."

The new outbreaks are expected to be reported in the follow-up report. - Mod.AS
