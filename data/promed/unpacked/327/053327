*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Heifers were reported to be aborting in different kraals in the same extension area. Samples were collected for testing, and all the 6 animals returned positive results.

[According to the 6-monthly and annual reports (2016 and 2017) sent to the OIE, brucellosis caused by _B. abortus_ is reported as a disease present in certain zones in the country, but no quantitative information is available.

Although this current event occurred 2 months ago, and Botswana has communicated it as resolved, it would be important to learn whether all the susceptible animals were tested. As is mentioned in the epidemiological comments, the 6 animals that aborted were positive to the disease. However, it is not clear whether all the susceptible animals on the premises were tested. As is mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Manual: "The disease is usually asymptomatic in young animals and non-pregnant females. Following infection with _B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_, pregnant adult females develop a placentitis, usually resulting in abortion between the 5th and 9th months of pregnancy. Even in the absence of abortion, profuse excretion of the organism occurs in the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges. The mammary gland and associated lymph nodes may also be infected, and organisms may be excreted in the milk. Subsequent pregnancies are usually carried to term, but uterine and mammary infection recurs, with reduced numbers of organisms in afterbirth products and milk. In acute infections, the organism is present in most major body lymph nodes" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf.

It would also be important to know whether modified stamping out was or will be used as a control measure, given that this disease is pathogenic for humans.

"_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and all infected tissues, cultures, and potentially contaminated materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions" http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf. - Mod.CRD
