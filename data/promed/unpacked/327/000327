According to Taiwan's "China Times News Network," the first local Japanese encephalitis case in Taiwan this year [2022] occurred in Tainan. Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control said on the 20 [Jun 2022] that the case is of a man in his 50s in Beimen District, Tainan City, who mostly lived at home and farmland on weekdays. He had no history of domestic or overseas travel. He started to have a fever on 7 Jun [2022] and developed lower limb weakness and changes in consciousness on 9 [Jun 2022] as well as other symptoms and was admitted to hospital. This is the 1st case of Japanese encephalitis in Taiwan this year [2022].

According to reports, Taiwan's deputy director of the CDC, Luo Yijun, stated that the man is in his 50s and had a fever and went to the clinic for medical treatment on 7 Jun [2022], but the symptoms were not relieved after using antipyretics. He was admitted to the emergency room on 9 [Jun 2022] and tested negative for the new coronavirus pneumonia. He suffered convulsions and coma on 19 [Jun 2022] and was admitted to the intensive care unit. On 15 [Jun 2022] he was suspected of having Japanese encephalitis and samples were sent for examination. The results were released on 18 [Jun 2022]. The follow-up epidemic investigation was completed, and the diagnosis was confirmed on 20 [Jun 2022]. He is currently hospitalized.

Luo Yijun pointed out that the main activities of the case were homes and farmland. One of the farmlands had a pig house 500 meters [550 yards] away, and there was an abandoned fish farm behind the pig house. A large number of vector mosquito larvae were collected, and it was concluded that the possibility of infection was high. Measures were taken to clean the environment and hang mosquito traps at the case's home and surrounding pig farms and to strengthen health education advocacy for the local people.

According to the report, Taiwan's CDC monitoring data show that Taiwan has a total of one confirmed case so far this year [2022], The cumulative number of cases in Taiwan from 2018 to 2021 are 37, 21, 21 and 28, respectively, with adults over 40 years old being most affected, but all age groups are at risk of infection. The public should still pay attention to mosquito prevention and not take it lightly.

It is reported that the epidemic season of Japanese encephalitis is from May to October every year in Taiwan, and the peak of the epidemic is from June to July. Taiwan's CDC stated that in Taiwan, the main vector mosquitoes are house mosquitoes and white-headed mosquitoes. They often breed in paddy fields, ponds and irrigation ditches, and the peak blood-feeding time is dusk and dawn. Most people infected with Japanese encephalitis virus have no obvious symptoms, and a few have headache, fever, or aseptic meningitis, paralysis, etc, or even coma or death.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis occur sporadically in Taiwan. The Japanese encephalitis (JE) transmission season in Taiwan is under way again this year (2022). More cases can be expected. The mosquito species _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ and other related _Culex_ species are efficient vectors of JE virus and breed in wet areas such as rice paddies. These culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult. JE is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is not stated whether the affected adult individual above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
