Unraveling the mystery of _Toxoplasma gondii_ in marine mammals
---------------------------------------------------------------
Researchers at California Polytechnic State University have discovered what
may be a clue to the mystery of why marine mammals around the world are
succumbing to a parasite that is typically only associated with cats. The
key may just be the lowly anchovy, according to research presented today at
the 108th General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology.

_Toxoplasma gondii_ is a protozoan parasite, which causes toxoplasmosis,
considered to be the 3rd leading cause of death attributed to foodborne
illness in the United States.

While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 20
per cent of the US population carries the parasite, the only known
reservoir of the infectious form of the parasite (the oocyst) are cats.
Over the past decade, toxoplasma infection has appeared in a variety of sea
mammals including beluga whales, dolphins, sea lions, and seals. It has
also become a major cause of death in sea otters living off the coast of
California.

It is estimated that about 17 per cent of sea otter deaths can be
attributed to toxoplasma.

While many believe fresh water runoff contaminated with cat feces is to
blame, there is no definitive science on the source of infection. The
question that drives our research is: how are marine mammals from the
Arctic Circle to Australia infected by a parasite that is spread primarily
through the consumption of infectious cat feces and infected meat?

Based on the global prevalence of _T. gondii_ infections, we hypothesize
that migratory filter feeders, specifically northern anchovies, are serving
to spread _T. gondii_ throughout the ocean, says Gloeta Massie, a graduate
student who conducted the research with associate professor Michael Black.
There is no previously published research on the ability of anchovies to
filter oocysts, that was the 1st step towards proving their hypothesis.
Massie and Black exposed northern anchovies to the parasite, and then,
using molecular techniques, tested for the presence of the parasite within
the fish.

They detected _T. gondii_ DNA in 66 per cent of the exposed fish. Now that
they have shown that anchovies can filter oocysts from the water, the next
step is to determine the infectivity of exposed anchovies to mammals.

Do our research findings mean that you should stop eating anchovy pizza?
No. _T. gondii_ oocysts are destroyed by high heat. Unfortunately, marine
mammals do not have the option of cooking their food before they eat it. As
anchovies are considered prey for practically every major predatory marine
fish, mammal, and bird, if the exposed anchovies harbor infectious oocysts,
this could present a possible transmission path of _T. gondii_ in the
marine environment, says Massie.

[It is not true as stated in the message that "only known reservoir of the
infectious form ... are cats." Cats are the main host and only cats and
other feline excrete oocysts in their feces. However, mammals and birds
infected with _T. gondii_ will harbor infective tissue cysts in their
muscles and brains for the rest of their lives, and carnivorous sea mammals
may get infected from eating carcasses floating in the water or eating
slaughterhouse waste dumped into the water.

The hypothesis that sea mammals are infected from cat feces floating in
water is quite hypothetical and requires that oocysts may survive in such
saline conditions and the feces may soon dissolve and free the oocysts.

As noted in the text, detecting DNA does not prove that herrings contain
live _T. gondii_ oocysts, but this could be tested quite easily by
inoculating _T. gondii_ mice with _T. gondii_ DNA containing anchovy. - Mod.EP]
