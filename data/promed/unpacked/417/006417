Vaccine drive after 4th rabies death
------------------------------------
The death of a 4th rabies victim in KwaZulu-Natal is likely to prompt more people to get their pets vaccinated, say Durban vets. "During June and July [2012], we saw a massive increase, far more than 200 percent, in the number of pets being brought in for the vaccination.

The SPCA [Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] had also held a free rabies clinic, which had been well supported, but only by residents of the surrounding suburbs, Govender said. He said this had prompted the SPCA to start outreach programmes. "We targeted libraries and schools, showing people what signs and symptoms to look out for, so they would not have to give up their animals."

He said that in the past 2 months his team had identified 2 other positive cases in Mariannhill, where the most recent victim, a 21-year-old person lived. The died at the weekend. "We found one on 1 Aug 2012 and the other on 18 Jul 2012," he said. The dogs were put down. He said some of the people who had come in to report suspected rabies cases misinterpreted the symptoms. "There are 2 kinds of rabies: one causes aggression, while the other is 'dumb,' meaning that the animal becomes meek and mild." He cautioned that aggression alone was not a sign of rabies -- a change of behaviour was a better indicator. So a dog that was normally aggressive should not be mistaken as rabid. He appealed to owners to check their dogs' vaccination documents and discuss rabies with their vets.

"One vaccination is not going to protect your dog. They need to be vaccinated every year." Dr Philip Parry, of the Windermere Vet Clinic in Morningside, said the 3 deaths earlier this year had raised awareness of rabies, and the 4th was likely to add to that trend. "We saw many people who had let their vaccinations lapse. They picked them up again, especially after the death of the Underberg 29-year-old farmer. So we haven't really seen new people seeking vaccinations for their pets."

He said that the deaths had been a "wake-up call" for many in the province. "Many people were quite shocked that you could contract the virus without being bitten [as in the 29-year-old farmer's case, where he contracted the virus when saliva from the dog made contact with an open wound]."

Dr Omashini Armoogum of the Montclair Animal Hospital said the hospital had also embarked on an awareness campaign, after hearing of people approaching other clinics wanting to put their pets to sleep, even if they were not necessarily rabid. "People don't know any better, so they need to be educated about the virus."

At the end of May [2012], a national daily newspaper came under fire from the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for a misleading report. The report said that pet owners needed to stay away from their newly vaccinated pets for one month, a claim the department called "scientifically inaccurate", because pets were not vaccinated with a live virus. "One cannot induce a rabies infection in a pet. Do parents stay away from their babies. for a month after they've been vaccinated against common children's diseases?" asked department spokesman, Steve Galane, at the time.

The 1st of this year's victims in KwaZulu-Natal was an 8-year-old child from Bergville, and the 2nd was a 52-year-old woman,a resident of Ngonyameni, outside Umlazi.

[Despite considerable efforts to increase awareness of the problem of canine rabies in KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa, human fatalities are still occurring. It may be that nothing short of compulsory canine vaccination will eradicate the danger.
