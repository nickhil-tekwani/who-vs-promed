The state Agriculture Department has sounded an alert on yellow rust on the wheat crop [and] has told officers to constitute special surveillance teams.

Signs of yellow rust had been spotted in certain areas in Ropar [Rupnagar] [and] later at 2 different spots in Hoshiarpur districts.

Punjab Director of Agriculture Gurdial Singh said that the patches were not more than 2x2 meters, but as any further spread of the disease could mean losses for farmers, the department was keeping an eye on it. He said yellow rust had so far affected only the HD-2967 variety of wheat and remedial measures had being initiated.

The Punjab Agriculture University had recently issued an advisory to the farmers.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge," providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Since about 2000, stripe rust strains with virulence to important resistance genes like Yr27 have emerged and spread rapidly across continents, causing major outbreaks. Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).
