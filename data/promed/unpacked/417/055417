UK Bluetongue vaccination roll out plan
---------------------------------------
Aim
---
The UK Bluetongue Vaccination Strategy has been agreed upon by industry
stakeholders using the overriding principle of facilitating the rapid
transfer of vaccine into animals as soon as it becomes available. The
vaccine roll-out plan also has to be flexible enough to take into account
the changing nature of the disease -- that is, moving zones, the various
levels of disease risk in the zones, and the timing and availability of the
vaccine.

Bearing these factors in mind, it is difficult to precisely predict the
situation we will be in once vaccine becomes available in England.
Therefore, the following text outlines the principles and considerations
that will be used in determining the roll-out of vaccine in England in
order to allow for revisions and flexibility in the plan as the situation
develops this year [2008].

Key principles and considerations
---------------------------------
Timing and availability of vaccine
----------------------------------
Roll-out of vaccine can primarily only be delivered as and when vaccine is
available. Intervet is contracted to provide the 22.5 million doses of
vaccine (20 million for use in England only, 2.5 million in Wales only),
and they will release the 1st doses to the UK in May 2008, subject to final
batch testing. They expect the May 2008 delivery to be 3 million doses but
are confident that they will exceed this commitment and hope that the
delivery in May 2008 will reach 5 million doses. The vaccine has to pass
rigorous control testing before it can be released for use. Intervet will
be in a position towards the end of April 2008 to provide updates every
week on the release of vaccine. The remainder of the doses are expected to
be received in June, July, and August 2008.

Depending on yields during the production process, it is possible that more
(or less) vaccine could be delivered before these dates. Therefore, the
plan is flexible in order to be prepared to roll-out vaccine earlier or
later if that is the case.

Administrative demarcation of vaccine roll-out
----------------------------------------------
Under EU law, vaccination can only be carried out in a Protection Zone;
however, roll-out of vaccine will be on a county by county basis. Given the
unpredictability of the disease situation, it is possible the current zones
may have expanded, or they may even be one single Restricted Zone covering
the whole of England by early summer 2008. This, therefore, offers an
unreliable means by which to demarcate vaccine availability now or later in
the year. Counties are easily recognisable and communicable boundary
markers by which livestock keepers and veterinarians can simply identify
when vaccine may be available or sold.

Decision making process and criteria for prioritising vaccine roll-out
--------------------------------------------
Given the medium/high risk that the disease situation and Restricted Zones
may change before vaccine becomes available, it is a risk to define the
vaccine roll-out plan for the whole year now purely based on the current
disease situation.

Therefore, a process for defining a priority list for counties to be
vaccinated will be used. The priority list will be regularly reviewed by
DEFRA, bluetongue experts, and the Core Industry Group in the period
leading up to the 1st vaccine becoming available and will continue to be
reviewed throughout the year. This will be based on epidemiological
evidence and veterinary risk at the time of each assessment, broadly using
the following criteria to aid the assessment.

1. Premises, local areas, or counties with the highest weight of infection
taking into account;
- premises, local areas, or counties with known circulating disease in 2007
- premises, local areas, or counties with known circulating disease in 2008
- epidemiological evidence indicating premises, local areas, or counties
with highest weights of infection
2. Counties at the highest risk of receiving infection
taking into account;
- which zone the county is in -- that is, PZ, SZ or Free Area (to assess
likelihood of disease risk from animal movements)
- geographical proximity to known infected premises
- meteorological data -- that is, likelihood of windborne incursion of
infected midges from infected areas of UK or EU.
- density of cattle and sheep population
3. Counties in the remainder Restricted Zone (PZ and SZ combined)
taking into account;
- geographical proximity to known infected premises
- meteorological data -- that is, likelihood of windborne incursion of
infected midges from infected areas of UK or EU.
- density of cattle and sheep population
4. Counties in the remaining areas of England
taking into account;
- geographical proximity to known infected premises
- meteorological data -- that is, likelihood of windborne incursion of
infected midges from infected areas of UK or EU.
- density of cattle and sheep population

A map outlining a rough approximation of the current priority areas is
available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/mapvacc-080401.pdf>.
This map is based on the current disease situation and therefore may change
before vaccine becomes available.

Physical roll-out of vaccine
----------------------------
Depending on the amount of vaccine available in the 1st batch, the number
of doses will be matched against the sheep and cattle populations (and
doses required) of the highest priority counties 1st, working down a list
of counties until no more vaccine is available in that batch. Once further
doses of vaccine become available, they will simply go to the next priority
county and so forth. Control of the supply of vaccine will be achieved
through legislation and licensing.

The intention is for 100 per cent of the vaccine to be purchased and used
by each county; however, it is possible this take-up rate will not be
achieved, and vaccine will be left unused. Therefore, the take-up levels
will be regularly reviewed for each county, and, pending these assessments,
any remaining vaccine stocks may be made available to the next priority
county or counties.

Purchase of vaccine
-------------------
All livestock keepers wishing to purchase vaccine should speak to their
private veterinarian for advice and to place an order.

German officials said Monday [31 Mar 2008] they were bulldozing through
plans to inoculate farm animals against bluetongue disease, which is common
in Mediterranean countries and has been spreading north.

The central state of Hesse has placed a binding order for 21 million
vaccination doses to be distributed to all 16 states without waiting for
federal regulatory approval for the substance. Hesse will pay about 17
million euros [USD 26.6 million] to the 3 manufacturers, the state
environment minister, Wilhelm Dietzel, said in Wiesbaden.

Federal agriculture official Gerd Mueller said in February 2008 that
Germany expected the vaccine for cattle, sheep and goats to win regulatory
approval in May 2008 after test animals had been observed for any ill effects.

The viral disease hit 20 479 animals last year [2007].

Bluetongue virus is transferred by midges. The disease is not dangerous to
humans, who can eat meat and milk from infected animals without risk, but
kills about 20 per cent of the animals it infects.

Berlin will now be pressed to pass an instant clearance for the vaccine in
May 2008 so that inoculations can proceed.

[The EU map showing the location of the restriction zones has been
prepared, as updated on 2 Apr 2008, is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_restrictedzones.jpg>.

As apparent from the map, the entire territories of Germany, the
Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg are colored red as BT restriction
zones, which are composed of the Protections zones (100 km) and
Surveillance zones (depth of at least 50 km extending beyond the limits of
the protection zone) around the infected farms. According to EU laws, BTV
vaccination can be carried out in protection zones. It seems that the above
countries will be able to cover their entire territories by the due
vaccination, while, in France, there are still areas in the south and north
west where vaccination is not allowed so far. Similarly, no vaccination is
allowed in large parts of the UK, such as Wales, Scotland, and Cornwall.
These areas include a dense population of sheep, the species most
vulnerable to BTV, a rather risky situation in territories into which the
BTV-8 may swiftly extend its spread during the coming summer [2008] months.

Information on BTV-8 vaccination plans (or otherwise) in other countries,
such as Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Italy, Spain, and Denmark, would
be appreciated.

Another issue to be dealt with is the species to be vaccinated: will goats
and camelids [llamas and camels] be included? The UK vaccination plan does
not address this issue. If remaining unvaccinated, goats may serve as
sentinels, enabling serological surveillance to follow the changing limits
of the infected zones. In traditionally BTV-infected regions, where sheep
only are vaccinated, the role of sentinels is played by bovines. In Europe,
however, bovines will be vaccinated. - Mod.AS]
