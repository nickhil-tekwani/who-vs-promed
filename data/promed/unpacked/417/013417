Cattle disease wreaks havoc for Patuakhali farmers
--------------------------------------------------
More than 200 buffaloes and cows died over the last several days, as
a cattle disease, locally called "tarka", broke out in different areas
of Charmontaj union under Galachipa upazila of Patuakhali district.

A resident of Char Bestin under Charmontaj union, said, "More than
200 buffaloes and cows died in the union and more than 500 others were
infected with the disease. We brought it to the notice of the doctor
posted at the Galachipa Livestock Department office, but they did not
visit the areas till Saturday," he alleged.

The worst affected areas are Char Bestin, Majher Char, Char Mandol,
and Char Rustam of the union. Every day the disease is spreading to
different other areas in the union, sources said.

Describing the symptoms of the disease, [another resident] of Char
Bestin said, "When one animal fell ill with the disease, at first it
could not walk, the temperature ran high and in 5 to 6 hours it died."
Judging from the symptoms, the doctor at the Galachipa Livestock
Department office confirmed it as tarka disease. He also advised [him]
to bring his sick animals to the upazila livestock office for
treatment, the farmer said.

[A farmer] of Majher Char said, "I had 52 buffaloes and about 100
cows. Of them, 14 buffaloes and 6 cows fell ill with the disease 8
days ago and 3 of the buffaloes died Saturday morning [30 Apr 2011]. I
went to the upazila livestock office 6 days ago and informed them of
the disease. When the doctor at the livestock office learnt about the
symptoms, he told me to bring the sick animals to his office. The
doctor has no idea about the inaccessible remote Char areas of the
upazila. I even offered to pay for his travel to the char area, but he
did not agree," [the man] alleged.

When contacted, Dr Humayun Kabir, officer of the upazila livestock
office, said, "We have sufficient medicines in our stock and I told
the farmers to bring their sick animals to my office. But they
informed me that they were not in a position to bring the animals to
the livestock office."

When asked why he did not go to the remote areas to treat the sick
animals, he said, "I have to take permission from the higher
authorities before leaving my office."

Laskar Tajul Islam, UNO [Upazila Nirbahi Officer/chief executive] of
Galachipa upazila, said, "I told him to go to the Char areas and treat
the animals. Even I warned him against failure to comply with the
decision. He later assured me that he would go there."

[An upazila is a small administrative area (sub-district) rather the
equivalent of a township and the immediate associated area.

The Department of Livestock Services [DLS] has communicated to us
that the news report of the large cattle die-off is not correct. The
district livestock office sent a team to Char Bestin and Majher Char
(remote islands 8 hours by boat from the subdistrict office) but did
not find large cattle die-offs, however, on one island they identified
5 calf deaths in the last 2 weeks (presumptive diagnosis bovine
ephemeral fever).

Dr Salah Uddin Khan [International Centre for Diarrheal Disease
Research, Bangladesh (ICCDR,B)] continues to gather information
relating to the reports.
