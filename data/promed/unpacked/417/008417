Mongolia has imposed a quarantine regime in 7 provinces for an indefinite period due to an outbreak of a highly contagious animal disease affecting sheep and goats. "As of today, the outbreak of highly infectious animal diseases is relatively calm in our country," said Khayangaa Bolorchuluun, minister of food, agriculture and light industry, while introducing the country's winter preparations during a meeting of the parliament session on Friday [18 Nov 2022]. Due to the outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR), also known as sheep and goat plague, a total of 22 locations in 15 soums (administrative subdivisions) of 7 provinces have been quarantined, said the minister.

The livestock sector is a main pillar of the Mongolian economy with around 70 million heads of livestock in the country with a population of around 3.4 million. Sheep and goats accounted for the majority of all livestock at the end of last year [2021], with 46.2% and 39.3%, respectively, according to the country's National Statistics Office.

[Mongolia's first peste des petits ruminants [PPR] outbreak occurred in the western region of Mongolia in sheep, goats, and yaks during September 2016 as an extension of PPR cases in China. The onset of the disease was met with rapid vaccination and restriction of livestock movement. The last outbreak in livestock was observed in 2017, but in January 2017 it was revealed that the disease spilled over into wild ungulates, including the critically endangered Mongolian saiga antelope (_Saiga tatarica_ Mongolica), which suffered large-scale mortality, as well as affecting Siberian ibex, goitered gazelle, and argali (wild sheep).

In August 2021, a PPR outbreak was identified in a mixed herd of sheep and goats in the Omnogovi province that borders the northern boundary of China (ProMED post 20210908.8654872). The event was declared resolved in October 2021. In April 2022, 3 outbreaks were reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH), one in Omnogovi and the others in different provinces. In all said events, the reported control measures included "quarantine and disinfection".

The sequencing of a recent Mongolian PPR strain showed closer identity with Chinese isolates than with isolates from Mongolia in 2016 from Lineage IV. This led the authors of a 2022 paper, from which some of the above information has been derived [ref], to suggest that the PPR virus still circulates in the region in a subclinical form in livestock or in wild ungulates that recognize no administrative boundaries during migration.

In 2017, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) and WOAH cooperatively launched a global PPR eradication programme (GEP), framed as a 15-year process running to 2030. The GEP is a multi-country, multi-stage process said to decrease epidemiological risk levels and increase prevention and control of PPR by first reducing its prevalence in the countries currently infected.

GEP's strategy is based upon a technical stepwise approach (stage 1 to stage 4). The affected countries have been grouped into 9 regions in which their progress is said to be assessed in regional roadmap meetings. Mongolia belongs to the group "Asia," which also includes China and southeast Asia (see at https://www.woah.org/en/disease/peste-des-petits-ruminants/#ui-id-4). In 2021, Mongolia was in the 1st stage of the roadmap, or "assessment".

Mass vaccination of small ruminants is a main measure on the road to control and, eventually, to eradicate PPR. Information from knowledgeable sources on the current vaccination coverage in Mongolia will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
