Researchers say _Streptococcus canus_, a virulent, gram positive
bacterium, is the culprit in the deaths of 6 greyhounds on the racetrack
curcuit in Florida last January [1999.
"This disease is like streptococcal infections in humans,"
says Brad Fenwick. "It just springs up and then disappears.
We really don't know why." Fenwick is a diplomate of the
American College of Veterinary Microbiologists, and a
pathologist at Kansas State University College of Veterinary
Medicine.
Fenwick and Dr. William Castleman of the University of Florida
College of Veterinary Medicine led the research into the cause
of the greyhound deaths at the prestigious Derby Lane Track
last January. The deaths sparked racetrack closing as far away
as New England.
Infected animals go from asymptomatic to dead within as little as
12 hours with massive lung hemorrhage. The disease has been
dubbed Canine Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (CSTSS)
because of the similarity of its symptoms to those of human Toxic
Shock Syndrome.
_S. canus_, a gram positive bacterium, does not respond to
antibiotics that target primarily gram negative bacteria. However,
some dogs treated quickly enough with clindamycin or penicillin-G
have recovered.
Dr. John F. Prescott of the Ontario Veterinary College in
Guelph [Canada was one of the researchers to name CSTSS
and identify _S. canus_ as the disease agent. (JAVMA, Vol. 209,
No. 8, October, 15, 1996).
"We were seeing as many as 1 or 2 cases a month," Prescott recalls.
"There were 2 categories. First, toxic shock where the dogs would die
very suddenly. Secondly, it could be associated with necrotizing fasciitis.
Sometimes there was overlap between the two."
Prescott says he saw the disease in dogs of all ages. Most were
healthy, but some might have had a mild infection. He says the
number of cases seen at Guelph has subsided in the last 2 years.
Both Fenwick and Prescott say CSTSS has probably been around
for a long time, but may have re-emerged as a result of changes in
antibiotic use. Prescott emphasizes subsequent research has shown
there is no "super bug". "We have no evidence that this is caused by a
single strain," Prescott says. "They were all different strains. We think
any _S. canus_ strain is capable of causing CSTSS."
