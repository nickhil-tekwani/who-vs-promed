Belgian authorities have identified the 1st case of rabies since the
country was declared rabies-free in 2001, the country's food agency
announced Thursday [25 Oct 2007].

A Labrador-cross dog, which lived in a family home in the southern
Brussels suburb of Beersel, was destroyed last Friday [19 Oct 2007]
after displaying symptoms of the disease which was subsequently
confirmed by laboratory testing, the federal agency for food chain safety said.

A 2nd dog which lived in the same house was also destroyed and tests
are pending.

A crisis meeting of scientists and public health experts was held
late Thursday [25 Oct 2007] and issued a series of precautionary measures.

Anyone who thinks they may have come in contact with the animal
should inform their doctor, they said.

All dogs in the area must be kept on leads even when they venture
further afield and owners are advised to vaccinate all dogs and cats
in the area as soon as possible, especially as the vaccine takes 3
weeks to work.

Belgium recorded its last case of rabies in 1999 and was declared
rabies-free 2 years later. The Belgian authorities stressed that the
infected animal had been illegally brought into the country from
Morocco recently.

The family involved have all been tested and vaccinated against
rabies and the food agency and other authorities are seeking to
contact anyone who may have come in contact with the dog, described
as looking like a black Labrador. "We can't say we will test every
fox, dog, or rat in the neighbourhood," Jooris told AFP. "But we have
set up a telephone number and we hope people will contact us if they
think they may have come into contact with the infected dog."

Rabies can be transmitted to humans through animal bites and is
nearly always fatal for those who have not been vaccinated. The
rabies virus infects the central nervous system. Symptoms include
fever and headache and can progress to partial paralysis,
hallucinations, and fear of water. Death usually occurs within days
of the symptoms appearing.

The World Health Organisation estimates that between 40 000 and 70
000 people die from rabies each year, with most in south and Southeast Asia.

[Belgium submitted an immediate notification on the case to the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health); it includes the following
background information:

"A 4-week-old dog imported by air from Morocco on 8 Jul 2007 by
private owners (pet dog). The 1st clinical signs were observed on 17
Oct 2007. A veterinary clinic in Brussels took charge of the case on
19 Oct 2007 and euthanized the animal on 20 Oct 2007. The body was
given to the Pasteur Institute on 20 Oct 2007 to establish the
diagnostics. On 22 Oct 2007, antigen detection by direct
immunofluorescence test showed positive results. On 24 Oct 2007,
virus was isolated on cell culture (neuroblastoma). Moreover, a 2nd
dog, which lived in the same family, was also euthanized, as a
preventive measure, and tested. The results are not yet known.
Epidemiological investigation is ongoing to make certain that no
other people or animals are at risk." See the notification and a map at

Belgium, similarly to all Western Europe, succeeded in eliminating
fox rabies from its territory, thanks to the methodical use of
anti-rabies vaccination of foxes. Similarly to its neighbours, it is
faced with 2 potential rabies risks: on one hand, the (rather slight)
risk from _Eptesicus serotinus_ bats which may harbour the EBLV-1
virus; and on the other hand, the risk from imported dog rabies, as
experienced in other west-European countries, mainly France, several
times. Though the European regulations require anti-rabies
vaccination for any transport of pets between rabies-free countries,
the fear is that illegal importation of young cats and dogs acquired
by travellers to rabies enzootic countries (mainly in North Africa)
continues. - Mod.AS]
