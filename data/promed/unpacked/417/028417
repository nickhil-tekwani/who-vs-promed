The Cayo and Stann Creek districts are under strict surveillance by
the Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA) after cattle in Cayo
and pigs in Stann Creek started showing signs of a disease called
vesicular stomatitis, known locally as sore mouth. There have been 3
reports from villages in the Cayo District and one report from the
Stann Creek District.

A BAHA Quarantine sign abuts a fence within which are 110 head of
cattle, 50 to 60 of them infected with what appears to be vesicular
stomatitis or sore mouth disease.

"At this time, we highly suspect vesicular stomatitis. We have the
farms under pre-quarantine, in other words, we are not allowing the
movement of pigs, horses, or cattle out of the affected farms."

Tell tale signs [of the disease] are abrasions on the gums, but there
are other signs. Dr. Miguel Depaz, Director Animal Health BAHA: "For
vesicular stomatitis, the clinical signs would be vesicles, and where
do you see the vesicles? They are on the lips, in the mouth, meaning
the pallet, the gum, the tongue. You could get vesicles on the tip of
the udder and just above the hoof, the coronary band; we refer to that
area as the coronary band; you could get vesicles there, and so the
animal would be salivating, the animal would have lameness. Those are
the signs that farmers should look for. If the farmer sees those
signs, they should call BAHA or the ministry of agriculture."

"It's transmitted by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are the vector of the
disease. In other words, you could control the disease by eliminating
breeding grounds of the mosquitoes. At this time we have identified
the affected districts to be Cayo and Stan Creek; hopefully, we will
not see it in the north. Nevertheless it's a zoonotic disease, meaning
that it can be transmitted from human to animal. The live animal can
transmit the disease to a human if the human is in close contact with
that animal. A human would have flu-like symptoms, in other words
headache and a fever, muscle aches. Vesicular stomatitis, if we
confirm it, should disappear in about 2 weeks; that's the period that
the disease would last. I am very sure that we will contain [the
disease] and, given the dynamics of the disease, in 2 weeks' time, the
disease on its own should disappear."

The village Chairman and an elder explained that it won't be in time
to save this community from major losses, particularly with their 600
pigs, 100 of which are coming up for slaughter in the next few days
but can't be slaughtered because of the quarantine, leading to losses
estimated to be in excess of USD 10 000 for this community of 50
families.

And while they worry about their livestock, BAHA is worrying about
the similarities between this endemic disease and a another far more
exotic and troublesome disease [i.e. foot and mouth disease -
Mod.TG].

[Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease which primarily affects
horses, cattle, and swine. The agent that causes vesicular stomatitis,
VSV, has a wide host range and can occasionally infect sheep and
goats. In affected livestock, VSV causes blister-like lesions to form
in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves,
and teats. These blisters swell and break, leaving raw tissue that is
so painful that infected animals generally refuse to eat and drink and
show signs of lameness. Severe weight loss usually follows, and in
dairy cows a severe drop in milk production commonly occurs. Affected
dairy cattle can appear to be normal and will continue to eat about
half of their feed intake.

VSV can be a zoonotic disease, causing flu-like symptoms in humans,
and on occasion cervical lymphadenopathy. People examining animals
suspected of having VSV should wear rubber gloves as well as
thoroughly wash their hands.
