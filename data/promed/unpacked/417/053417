Washington State: First Suspected Human Case of West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------------------
A Franklin County man is being evaluated for suspected West Nile virus
(WNV) infection, based on the results of preliminary tests. The man became
ill in mid-May [2003], was treated as an outpatient and is now recovering.
The state Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) are running more tests, but if confirmed this would be the
first human case of this mosquito-borne disease acquired in Washington state.
"Many people are concerned about West Nile virus; rightfully, this case
will create even more concern," said Benton-Franklin Health Officer Dr.
Larry Jecha. "We want to use this opportunity to stress the importance of
people protecting themselves from mosquito bites to prevent exposure to
West Nile virus and the importance of mosquito control districts to help
reduce the risk of mosquito transmitted disease. This virus can cause
serious illness, but most people who are infected have no symptoms or
develop only mild symptoms such as headache, fever and body aches."
WNV can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis
(inflammation of the spinal cord and lining of the brain). Commercial tests
for WNV are not specific, and can cross-react with other closely related
mosquitoes-borne viruses. Although the patient's preliminary test results
are positive for a mosquito borne-illness, confirmation of West Nile virus
infection by the CDC will take about 2 weeks.
The state Department of Health and local health departments are working
together on monitoring and testing dead birds to detect West Nile virus and
track the disease. Dead birds are often the first indicator that WNV has
moved into a new area, as occurred last fall in Washington. State and local
health agencies also provide education on mosquito bite prevention and
reducing preferred mosquito-breeding sites around homes. "Our West Nile
virus surveillance project detected the disease in 2 birds and 2 horses in
Washington last year, which told us the virus was here. The patient in
Franklin County is among several suspected cases of human WNV infection
being investigated in the United States," said Dr. Jo Hofmann, State
Epidemiologist for Communicable Disease for the Washington Department of
Health.

[It is noteworthy that this would be the first human case in the USA this
year, and the first human case from the state of Washington. This report
should be regarded with caution, however, since it is unusual for reports
of human cases to precede the detection of virus in wild birds, equines,
mosquitoes and sentinel flocks. A press release by the state has stated
that surveillance for dead birds began on 7 May 2003
<http://www.doh.wa.gov/Publicat/2003_News/03-082.htm>, and the current USGS
map indicates that wild birds from 17 counties in Washington state are
under test. - Mods.MPP/CP]
