Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has claimed 5 lives in the country since the beginning of the current Iranian calendar year (21 Mar [2020]), director of zoonotic diseases management office at the Ministry of Health has said.

Behzad Amiri said that over the past 5 months, 38 people have been diagnosed with the disease but were cured and survived death.

Last year, 119 persons were diagnosed with Crimean-Congo fever in the country, of whom 11 died, he regretted, adding, since the beginning of this year [2020], 38 people have been identified with Crimean-Congo fever, of whom 5 have lost their lives, unfortunately.

Mohammad Nabavi, deputy director for communicable diseases department of the Ministry of Health, said that some 10% of the people who are diagnosed with Crimean-Congo fever and receive proper medical care may die, while this number increases to 50% for the people who do not get any treatments.

According to the Health Ministry, some 100-150 cases of Crimean-Congo fever are annually reported in Iran.

According to the World Health Organization, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. CCHF outbreaks have a case-fatality rate of up to 40%.

The virus is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, family Nairoviridae, genus _Orthonairovirus_, is an RNA virus that commonly infects domestic livestock and wildlife; such an infection is not accompanied by specific clinical signs in animals. _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks are regarded as the main vectors in nature; humans are accidental hosts, and human infection is usually acquired via a tick bite or after contact with infected livestock, their blood, or other secretions (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15550268/). Up to 80% of CCHF cases are subclinical and seropositive.

On the basis of various studies conducted in Iran since 1972, virus circulation has been demonstrated in different regions of Iran. The 1st human clinical cases were confirmed in 1999 in western Iran after a nosocomial infection. Since then, the disease has been reported in different parts of Iran, and a surveillance system has been put in place with cases reported from almost all provinces in the country.

Disease outbreaks in humans continue to be a threat because livestock hosts, tick vectors, and the virus are found nationwide. Because of common borders with disease-endemic countries and the high frequency of travel and livestock transport, control of the disease in border areas should be more thorough and border quarantines should be improved along with strengthened animal and human surveillance. - Mod.UBA
