"We had managed to bring down the number of dengue cases from 106 cases in January [2014] and 154 cases in February [2014] to 33 cases in March [2014]."

He said from the total 293 cases in the 1st 3 months of this year [2014], Kuala Muda district recorded the highest number of dengue cases. "Kuala Muda district tops the list with 22 cases, followed by Kubang Pasu and Kota Star with 3 cases each.

[Normally, ProMED-mail does not report single cases of DHF, but this unique case was initially thought to be due to an Ebola virus infection. Reports of dengue cases in Africa generally, and Nigeria specifically, are relatively rare.
