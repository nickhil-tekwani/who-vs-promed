In Russia (Bashkortostan) a new case of bovine anthrax has been registered.
According to the press service of the state department of emergency
situations, the dangerous infection was discovered in a 14-month-old heifer
in one of the private farmsteads in the village of Zyak-Ishmetovo in the
Kuyurgazin district. The ill animal was killed and burnt. The [source] of
the infection has not been identified yet. The diagnosis has been
established by the district veterinary laboratory but has yet to be
confirmed at the republic's laboratory.
The group of specialists arrived on 26 Oct 2005 and conducted measures to
prevent spread of the infection. According to the veterinary department in
the Ministry of Agricultural Affairs, the chief personnel of the district
administration have introduced quarantine in the village of Zyak-Ishmetovo.
Vaccination will be conducted on the 760 cattle and 16 people that were in
contact with the infected animal.
This is the 2nd case in October 2005 registered in Russia (Bashkortostan).
On 12 Oct, anthrax was discovered in Gafuriyaskiy district. A female
resident of the village of Kovardi was infected with the cutaneous form of
infection from her own cow; she was under treatment in the local hospital.
The residents of the village and their animals were vaccinated, and the
area disinfected.
Cases of animal anthrax have been registered in Bashkortostan from time to
time, the last one in 1998

[During 1999-2004 in Russia 155 cases of anthrax were registered in humans,
including 16 in 2004. All had taken part in the slaughter of cattle,
butchering carcasses, and/or the transportation of meat.
Regarding anthrax in animals, in 2004, 3 outbreaks occurred in Russia with
a total of 9 animals affected. In 2003 there were 11 outbreaks and 18
animals affected. In Russia there are unreported cases, and frequently
cattle are not vaccinated prophylactically, which maintains the threat of
disease. In 2003, 125 048 persons were vaccinated against anthrax; in 2004,
114 390.
The widespread anthrax in Russia in the past and the repeated annual
outbreaks mean that there is a constant threat of anthrax in animals and
people. The above data are taken from the state report "About sanitary and
epidemiological situation in the Russian Federation in 2004"
<http://www.gsen.ru/doc/gosdoclad/report2004.pdf> )
- ProMED Russian Correspondents]
[There is, unfortunately, a long tradition of vaccinating humans against
anthrax in Russia. These annual figures starkly underline the failure of
the Russian veterinary services in controlling this disease, even if one
were to claim that the risk of infection is sometimes applied with a broad
public health brush.
Unless one is dealing with occupational industrial exposure to infected
hides or contaminated wool or hair, any human case of anthrax and any need
to vaccinate humans (outside of research laboratories) reflects a failure
of the veterinary profession wherever such a situation exists. - Mod.MHJ]
