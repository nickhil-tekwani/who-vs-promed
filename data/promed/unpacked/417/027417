A severe case of blowfly strike has been reported in Dorset in which 50 per cent of a lamb group have been hit by the disease, according to an interactive map chronicling the UK's 1st blowfly strikes of 2018. The interactive map, produced by Elanco Animal Health and NADIS (National Animal Disease Information Service), highlights areas hit with blowfly strike in real-time, aiming to deliver an immediate warning system for farmers, vets and industry professionals.

The 1st reported incidents were in Hampshire, before spreading across Devon, West Sussex, and Buckinghamshire. Latest reports are in northern England and some initial cases in Scotland. The NADIS and Elanco blowfly risk forecast suggests that weather conditions from southern England and Wales to the Midlands mean that flies are now active, and females are laying eggs that result in serious welfare and productivity issues.

Richard Wall, professor of zoology at Bristol University said the timing and severity of blowfly strike is strongly influenced by the weather. "This is a reminder to farmers that now is the time to act for early prevention. Delaying treatment not only costs the farm but risks the welfare and productivity of the flock. Strike can develop very quickly, with the 1st maggots appearing within 12 hours of eggs being laid. Don't get caught out," Mr Wall said.

Fiona Hutchings, technical Vet at Elanco said the costs of inaction when it comes to blowfly strike far outweigh the costs of protection.

Blowfly strike is a major economic concern for farmers with considerable prevention costs involved for all at-risk sheep. Sheep affected with blowfly strike have disrupted grazing patterns and rapidly lose weight especially if untreated for several days. Death occurs in neglected sheep.

[The term 'myiasis' is defined as the infestation of any part of the body with the larvae of dipterous flies of any kind.

In sheep there are 3 kinds of myiasis:
1. Infestation of the wool and skin with the larvae of several species of blowflies.
2. Infestation of wounds with larvae of screwworm flies (an OIE-listed disease).
3. Infestation of the nasal passages and frontal sinuses with the larvae of _Oestrus ovis_.

The condition referred to as "blowfly strike" in Britain and Australia occurs, in fact, in all sheep producing countries. In Britain, the important blowfly is _Lucilia sericata_. The condition for the fly strike are most favorable in fine wool sheep with wrinkled skin in the breech region. Body strike occurs when there is excessive moisture and matting of wool on the back and sides. Head strike occurs in horned rams with accumulation of dirt and grease in the wool around the base of the horns. 'Pizzle strike' is due to urinary soiling of the wool around the opening of the prepuce.

Prevention consists of correcting conditions which attract the flies, or the use of insecticides or repellents to repel or kill the flies or prevent the development of larvae (maggots) from eggs that may be deposited. In areas where blowfly strike is a serious problem, it can be reduced by the mass application of insecticides.

The NADIS blowfly alert is available at http://alerts.nadis.org.uk. It forecasts the level of strike risk for different regions of the UK, updated every 2 weeks through June and monthly through July to October. The forecasts are supported by on farm reporting of cases. - Mod.AS
