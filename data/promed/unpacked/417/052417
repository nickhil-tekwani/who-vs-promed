A superbug outbreak has been reported in the Italian region of Tuscany. Authorities in Tuscany, home to some of Italy's most visited tourist attractions, have stepped up hospital controls after a deadly outbreak of the New Delhi superbug.

The antibiotic-resistant killer has shown "significant diffusion in the northwestern area of Tuscany" since November 2018, infecting at least 75 people, local health authority ARS said. The bacterial disease is believed to have killed at least 31 people in 17 different hospitals since then, Italian media reported Thursday [12 Sep 2019].

More than 31 cases were reported in Pisa, home to the famous leaning tower.

Superbug NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1) sparked a global panic when it was found in the Indian capital in 2010 and showed resistance even to carbapenems, a group of antibiotics often reserved as a last line of defense.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in June [2019] issued a rapid risk assessment after a "large outbreak" of the New Delhi superbug in Tuscany. It warned of possible cross-border infections, "especially since the affected area is a major tourist destination." Tuscany's health authority said "the ability to resist antibiotics makes these bacteria dangerous, especially in vulnerable patients, already affected by serious pathologies or immunosuppressed." As a result, hospitals in the region have "stepped up procedures for the prevention and control of infections in health facilities," it said.

[blaNDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.) are members of a group of enzymes called carbapenemases that destroy carbapenem antibiotics, as well as most other beta-lactam antibiotics. Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that include ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases. Other resistance mechanisms, which include reduced affinity of penicillin-binding protein for carbapenems, increased efflux of the beta-lactam antibiotics, or decreased permeability of the outer membrane due to loss of outer membrane porin channels, may be combined with production of the carbapenemase. There are several distinct types of carbapenemase: KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases such as KPC-1, -2, -3, -4, etc.); OXA types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases); NDMs (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases such as NDM-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, etc.); IMP; and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamase).

Carbapenemases can be divided into either metallo-beta-lactamases that contain bound zinc ions in their active sites or serine carbapenemases that contain serine at the active site. NDM, IMP and VIM are metallo-beta-lactamases, and KPC and OXA are serine beta-lactamases.

Vaborbactam (marketed with the carbapenem antibiotic meropenem) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5655098/) and avibactam (marketed in combination with the 3rd-generation cephalosporin ceftazidime) inhibit the KPCs. Avibactam also inhibits some OXA carbapenemases. However, neither avibactam nor vaborbactam inhibits the metallo-carbapenemases.

Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on plasmids or other mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements can facilitate spread of resistance genes among organisms of the same species or even different bacterial species. Mobile genetic elements frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that these organisms have been susceptible only to toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline. - Mod.ML
