This report [of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease] is identified as a UK incident. The text confirms that this cluster of _Legionella_ infections occurred in London, Ontario, Canada -- so not really the UK. Please could you update.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Ellam for correcting the record that the location of this outbreak of Legionnaires' disease is London, Ontario, Canada, not London, England. ProMED-mail regrets the confusion that the posting on 28 Sep 2019 has caused.

London, with a population of 383 822 residents in 2016, is a city in southwestern Ontario, Canada, approximately 200 km (120 mi) from both Toronto and Detroit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London,_Ontario). A map showing the location of London, Ontario, Canada can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/London,+ON,+Canada. - Mod.ML
