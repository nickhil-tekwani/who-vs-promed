Update on the epidemic situation of new coronavirus pneumonia as of 24:00 on [21 Feb 2020]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At 04:00 on [21 Feb 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 397 new confirmed cases and 109 deaths (106 cases in Hubei; Hebei, Shanghai, and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, 1 case [each]); 1361 suspected cases were newly added.

On the same day, 2393 cases were cured and discharged, 26 441 were close contacts of medical observation, and 156 severe cases were reduced [? improved].

As of 24:00 on [21 Feb 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 53 284 confirmed cases (among which 11 477 were severe cases), a total of 20 659 discharged cases were cured, and a total of 2345 deaths were reported. A total of 76 288 confirmed cases have been reported, and 5365 suspected cases have been reported. A total of 618 915 close contacts were traced, and 113 564 close contacts were still in medical observation.

[According to the report above, there have now been a total of 76 288 cases of confirmed COVID-19 reported from China, representing an increase of 397 cases from the revised cumulative total in the past 24 hours, of which 366 (92.2%) were in Hubei. In addition, there were 109 deaths reported, of which 108 (99.1%) were in Hubei. There were no new cases reported from Hong Kong.

While there are fewer cases being reported on a daily basis in China, the number of cases and deaths reported from outside of China keeps increasing (see following sections below). It is definitely too soon to celebrate, as transmission outside of China increases.

[As mentioned previously, this website is constantly updated as new information comes in, so it is likely that when you read this post, the numbers will not match the linked numbers because they will have been updated since the post was prepared.

According to the data on the Johns Hopkins website, there are now a total of 1371 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from outside mainland China, representing an increase of 105 cases reported in the past 24 hours, with South Korea accounting for 73 of the newly reported cases (see section [5]B below). There were 13 newly reported positive PCR tests among the Diamond Princess population. A very challenging situation having countries in all global time zones reporting officially their case counts around the 24-hour clock. - Mod.MPP]

Iranian health officials reported (computer translated) an additional 13 COVID-19 cases and 2 deaths today [21 Feb 2020]. According to Dr. Kianoush Jahanpour, "Of the 13 cases, most are either residents of Qom or have had a history of traveling to Qom in recent days and weeks." Of the 13 newly identified cases, 7 are in Qom, 4 in Tehran, and 2 in Guila.

"Two of the newly identified cases have unfortunately also died," he noted. This brings the total COVID-19 cases in Iran to 18, including 4 fatalities.

Lastly he said, "Like the pattern seen in H1N1 flu, severe cases and deaths in COVID-19 appear to be more common in the elderly or with people [who have] underlying diseases or immune deficiencies. The pathogenicity of the virus does not necessarily exceed the H1N1 influenza."

COVID-19 update -- Iran reports 2 more deaths and 13 new cases
-------------------------------
World health officials said Friday [21 Feb 2020] that the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak in Iran, where health officials confirmed 18 new cases and 4 deaths in just 2 days, is "very worrisome."

The report on the additional deaths and confirmed cases comes as Iranians turned out to vote in nationwide parliamentary elections on Friday [21 Feb 2020]. Kianoush Jahanpour, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, says the newly detected cases are all linked with the city of Qom, where the 1st 2 elderly patients died on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020], according to the Associated Press.

A Chinese company has been building a solar power plant in Qom, and Minoo Mohraz, an Iranian health ministry official, said the virus "possibly came from Chinese workers who work in Qom and traveled to China." She did not elaborate.

According to CNBC News, the outbreak of the coronavirus in Iran has been linked to a case in Canada and another infection of a 45-year-old woman in Lebanon after those patients traveled to the Middle East nation.

"The cases that we see in the rest of the world, although the numbers are small, but not linked to Wuhan or China, it's very worrisome," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, said Friday [21 Feb 2020] at a news conference at the agency's headquarters in Geneva. "These dots are actually very concerning."

Tedros says world health officials still have a chance to contain the virus, but it's getting less likely by the day. "The window of opportunity is still there, but our window of opportunity is narrowing," he said. "We need to act quickly before it closes completely." He also cautioned: "This outbreak could still go in any direction."

The biggest threat from the virus is still its spread to countries with weaker health systems. As of now, there are no proven remedies for COVID-19; however, preliminary results from 2 clinical trials testing potential treatments for COVID-19 are expected in 3 weeks, Tedros said.

[Our thanks to Mary Marshall and ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka for submitting similar articles.

Unfortunately, I fear that many of the rumors about a much larger outbreak in Iran are turning out to be correct. There clearly is local transmission ongoing, at present seemingly focused on contact in Qom, a religious pilgrimage site for Shi'ites. The identification of the 2 travelers also provides circumstantial evidence that there is significant local transmission ongoing.

I can't help but wonder if the observed mentioned peak in influenza noted in yesterday's (Thu 20 Feb 2020) media report was mistakenly initially all attributed to influenza, perhaps without testing until something changed and triggered testing for the SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. I suspect we will be learning of more cases over the coming days. The apparent high case fatality ratio (4 out of 18, or 22.2%) may be a function of case definition chosen for testing and may drop back down after a wider net for testing is implemented. Any additional information on these cases would be appreciated.

Qom is located to the southwest of Tehran in central Iran, and Guila is to the northwest of both Qom and Tehran and is located on the Caspian Sea. A good map of Iran showing provinces can be found at https://www.mapsofworld.com/iran/iran-political-map.html.

In Lebanon, Health Minister Hamad Hassan on Friday [21 Feb 2020] reported the Mediterranean country's 1st case of the new virus. At a news conference in Beirut, he said the patient was a 45-year-old woman who arrived Thursday [20 Feb 2020] on a flight from Qom. He said the woman was in "good health," and the ministry was also following up on the cases of 2 other people suspected of having the illness.

The woman and 2 other suspected victims were quarantined at the Rafik Hariri government hospital in Beirut.

[This is the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19 reported by Lebanon, making Lebanon the 28th country worldwide to report laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. Both this case and the case reported yesterday (Thu 20 Feb 2020) in British Columbia, Canada, are associated with travel to Iran. Information on contact tracing in Iran would be of interest to try to identify the chains of transmission.

As mentioned above, I suspect we will learn of other cases with a history of travel to Qom, a major religious and educational center in Iran, with visitors from countries with Shi'ite populations as well as scholars interested in studying Shi'ia history, philosophy, and traditions.

One of the 11 Israelis who were flown home after being quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan has tested positive for the new virus that emerged in China late last year [2019], the 1st case to be reported inside Israel, the Health Ministry said Friday [21 Feb 2020].

The Israeli cruise ship passengers, who had all initially tested negative for the new coronavirus, arrived on a charter plane overnight. They were met by medics in protection suits and immediately taken to the Sheba Hospital near Tel Aviv, where they will be kept in quarantine.

Another 4 Israelis were hospitalized in Japan after testing positive for the virus.

[This is the 1st case reported from Israel, but one of at least 25 evacuees from the Diamond Princess who tested negative before leaving Japan, but upon return to their countries tested positive (USA - 18, Australia - 6). I suspect we will learn of additional evacuees retesting as positive in the coming days. One knows for other viruses (especially norovirus), cruise ships have been excellent incubators for fairly widespread transmission. It appears as though that is the case for this coronavirus. This is now the 30th country worldwide to report confirmed cases of COVID-19.

[6] Selected media reports of transmission outside of mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship: 13 new cases, more passengers leave

A total of 970 passengers have disembarked from the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Diamond Princess since a 2-week quarantine period ended 2 days ago [Wed 19 Feb 2020], the health ministry said Friday [21 Feb 2020]. The 3rd and final group of 253 passengers who tested negative for the coronavirus on the cruise ship in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo, have disembarked, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said. The 3-day process involved a group of 443 passengers who left on Wednesday [19 Feb 2020], followed by 274 passengers on Thursday [20 Feb 2020].

The ship arrived at the port carrying some 3700 passengers and crew. Those who tested positive were sent to medical facilities, of whom 2 Japanese passengers have died. Around 300 passengers and about a thousand crew members remain aboard the vessel, the ministry said.

Those still on the ship include over 100 passengers who had close contact with infected passengers by sharing rooms, and they will also disembark and move to a government-provided facility on Saturday [22 Feb 2020] for an extended quarantine, the ministry said, scrapping the original plan to make them stay another 14 days on the ship. The government will keep on board foreign passengers waiting for charter flights that will take them back to their home countries.

Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said at a press conference that 759 foreign nationals have already been evacuated by the United States, South Korea, Australia, Hong Kong, Israel, and Canada.

Britain, Italy, and Taiwan sent planes to repatriate citizens Friday [21 Feb 2020], while Indonesia and the Philippines plan to do so. "We will do everything we can to support foreign nationals," Motegi said.

There have been 634 confirmed cases of the virus from among those on the ship. Of them, an 87-year-old man and an 84-year-old woman died Thursday [20 Feb 2020] after being hospitalized; 33 passengers, all of them in their 40s through 80s, were listed in serious condition as of Friday [21 Feb 2020], and among them 18 have chronic diseases.

The total number of infections confirmed in Japan topped 730 on Friday [21 Feb 2020] with more new cases, including 2 brothers attending a primary school, reported in Hokkaido, and a preschool boy in Saitama Prefecture. The brothers' school in Nakafurano on Friday [21 Feb 2020] canceled all afternoon classes and sent home around 200 students following their diagnosis. Authorities in Hokkaido are investigating how the boys, neither of whom had been overseas lately, contracted the virus. The boy in Saitama Prefecture returned from Wuhan at the center of the virus outbreak to Japan on a government-chartered flight on [30 Jan 2020] with his father, who tested positive for the virus on [10 Feb 2020].

As part of efforts to prevent further spread of the new coronavirus in Japan, the health ministry said Friday [21 Feb 2020] it will encourage more companies to promote telework and staggered working hours. The ministry will make the request through the Japan Business Federation and other lobbies. It will also ask firms to enable employees with fever or other symptoms to take off work [with] ease. "We need the understanding of companies to keep the virus from spreading," Kato said at a press conference.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said 48 additional cases were compiled between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., lifting the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients in the nation to 204. The authorities had reported 52 new cases earlier in the day.

The KCDC said all but 2 of the 48 latest cases are related with the Daegu branch of a religious sect where "super-spreading" of the virus was suspected of having occurred. After a member of the sect was diagnosed with the disease on Tuesday [18 Feb 2020], 143 other members of the branch were also confirmed to be infected.

The 2 other cases, which are not associated with the religious group, were reported in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

The number of cases at Cheongdo Daenam Hospital near Daegu, where the nation's 1st death linked to the virus occurred, remained at 16, while the number of novel coronavirus patients in Daegu and North Gyeongsang Province rose to 153.

Meanwhile, the nation's 19th confirmed patient, a 37-year-old South Korean man, was released from quarantine, bringing the total of number of those fully recovering from the virus to 17.

More than 16 000 people have been tested for the virus so far, and over 3000 of them are awaiting results.

[Cases continue to be confirmed in Daegu related to the Church. As mentioned previously, this church has recently built a church in Wuhan and may well be the location of transmission, with the 1st identified case having a history of travel to Wuhan prior to onset of illness. An epidemic curve would be interesting to see as well as information on the epidemiologic investigation findings.

A Reuter's newswire was just submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-southkorea-cases/south-korea-reports-142-additional-coronavirus-cases-brings-total-to-346-kcdc-idUSKBN20G02F) stating that "South Korea reported 142 additional confirmed cases of the coronavirus, bringing the nation's total to 346, according to Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the new cases, 91 have been traced to a hospital in Cheongdo County, which was designated as one of the "special care zones" by the government." So the tally of cases in South Korea keeps growing.

Italian health officials reported at least 16 COVID-19 cases today, with 14 people infected with the coronavirus in Lombardy, while another 2 other cases have been identified in Veneto.

In the Lombardy region, a 38-year-old man fell ill with the virus after meeting someone who returned from China in late January [2020]. Five doctors and nurses and several patients were infected at the hospital in Codogno where he was treated.

Three other people, who all visited the same cafe in the Lombardy region, also tested positive for the virus.

President Fontana and Minister Speranza signed an order with very precise measures concerning the area in which people who have been identified as positive live and move. The municipalities are Codogno, Castiglione d'Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Maleo, Fombio, Bertonico, Castelgerundo, Terranova dei Passerini, Somaglia and San Fiorano.

Councilor Gallera then thanked the "health system for the work done continuously since yesterday [Thu 20 Feb 2020] evening, which has managed to identify links and links."

President Fontana stressed that "the regional coordination table is always open; we are ready to react to any eventuality. We have taken steps that should not be understood as something that can be frightening but as something that can block the epidemic."

The 1st European to succumb to the coronavirus has died in Italy, just hours after 10 towns were locked down following a flurry of new cases. A 78-year-old Italian from the Veneto region who had tested positive for the virus died in the hospital, where he had recovered some 10 days earlier for an unrelated health issue, Italy's health minister said. [He] was a retired bricklayer and one of 2 with the disease in the region, while 15 other people were discovered to have caught the virus in Lombardy, which took immediate measures to isolate affected areas.

Five doctors and 10 other people tested positive for the virus in Lombardy after apparently frequenting the same bar and group of friends, with 2 other cases in Veneto, authorities said at a press conference. Over 50 000 people have been asked to stay at home in the areas concerned, while all public activities such as carnival celebrations, church masses, and sporting events have been banned for up to a week.

[A major increase in cases reported today in Italy along with the 1st death of a European in Europe. The addition of these 16 newly confirmed cases brings the total of cases reported in Italy to 19. Are we seeing more transmission through super-spreaders? The major increase in South Korea, the major increase in Italy, and the large number of infected individuals on a cruise ship theoretically having the virus introduced by a single individual from Hong Kong? Of concern is the mention that 5 of the cases in Lombardy were in physicians who may well have transmitted the virus to patients under their care.

Lombardy is in the north central of the country, with Veneto on its western border in the northwest of the country. A good map of Italy showing provinces is available at http://ontheworldmap.com/italy/italy-provinces-map.html. - Mod.MPP]

[7] WHO situation report 32 (as of 21 Feb 2020*)
Date: Fri 21 Feb 2020

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. CET.

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
- Through the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN), national food safety authorities are seeking more information on the potential for persistence of SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, on foods traded internationally as well as the potential role of food in the transmission of the virus. Currently, there are investigations conducted to evaluate the viability and survival time of SARS-CoV-2. As a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk, or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.

Subject in Focus: food-related considerations
The new COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. The most likely ecological reservoirs for SARS-CoV-2 are bats, but it is believed that the virus jumped the species barrier to humans from another intermediate animal host. This intermediate animal host could be a domestic food animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal that has not yet been identified.

WHO continues to collaborate with experts, member states, and other partners to identify gaps and research priorities for the control of COVID-19 and to provide advice to countries and individuals on prevention measures. National food safety authorities have been following this event with the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) secretariat to seek more information on the potential for persistence of the virus on foods traded internationally and the potential role of food in the transmission of the virus. Experiences from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) show that transmission through food consumption did not occur. To date, there have not been any reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. However, concerns were expressed about the potential for these viruses to persist on raw foods of animal origin.

Currently, there are investigations conducted to evaluate the viability and survival time of SARS-CoV-2. In general, coronaviruses are very stable in a frozen state, according to studies of other coronaviruses, which have shown survival for up to 2 years at -20 deg C [-4 deg F]. Studies conducted on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV indicate that these viruses can persist on different surfaces for up to a few days depending on a combination of parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light. For example, at refrigeration temperature (4 deg C [39 deg F]), MERS-CoV can remain viable for up to 72 hours. Current evidence on other coronavirus strains shows that while coronaviruses appear to be stable at low and freezing temperatures for a certain period, food hygiene and good food safety practices can prevent their transmission through food. Specifically, coronaviruses are thermolabile, which means that they are susceptible to normal cooking temperatures (70 deg C [158 deg F]). Therefore, as a general rule, the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk, or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods.

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are susceptible to the most common cleaning and disinfection protocols, and there is no indication so far that SARS-Cov-2 behaves differently.

[The number of countries reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 with transmission occurring outside China remains at 15 (Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Viet Nam, Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, USA, France, Germany, Spain, UK, UAE, Egypt, and Iran). Although with the recent transmission in Italy, this number will go up to 16 countries by tomorrow [Sat 22 Feb 2020]. Note also that with the media reports above, these data will most likely change in tomorrow's update. There has also been local transmission noted on the cruise ship quarantined in Japan, 1st identified in a quarantine officer, but continued transmission of the coronavirus has been occurring on the ship.

Please note that publications presented in these updates that come from bioRxiv are pre-peer review manuscripts, and final publications may be significantly different.

Also, it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
