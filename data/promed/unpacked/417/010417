Ebola in Uganda - update
------------------------
As of Wed 28 Nov 2012, the Ministry of Health in Uganda reported 7 cases (6 confirmed, 1 probable) with Ebola haemorrhagic fever [Ebola virus disease] in the Luwero and Kampala districts. Of these cases, 4 died. [WHO Note: The total number of cases reported on 23 Nov 2012 was 10 (6 confirmed, 4 probable) Probable cases that tested negative for Ebola have been classified as Non-Cases and excluded from the case counts.]

Field teams continue to investigate cases alerted to them from the communities. The major challenge faced in some communities is the belief that witch-craft and not Ebola [virus] was the cause of deaths, despite ongoing intensive awareness campaigns. Social mobilization teams are working closely with traditional healers and religious leaders to raise awareness on prevention and control of the disease.

The WHO and partners, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the Uganda Red Cross (URCS), African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) and Plan Uganda continue to support the national authorities in the response to the outbreak. Through the WHO, an expert on infection prevention and control has been deployed to the field.

With respect to this event, the WHO does not recommend that any travel or trade restriction be applied to Uganda.

[This update does not report any new confirmed cases in this outbreak since the previous WHO update dated 23 Nov 2012, and reproduced as ProMED-mail post: Ebola virus disease - Uganda (29): (LO) WHO update 20121123.1422071. This new update reports that 3 of the 4 probable cases identified in the previous update have not been confirmed, and the case count returns to 7 (6 confirmed and one probable). It appears that the outbreak in the Luwero and Kampala districts, for the moment, has been contained.

The locations of the Luwero and Kampala Districts can be found in the map of the Districts of Uganda (no. 48 and 29, in the Central Region) at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda.
