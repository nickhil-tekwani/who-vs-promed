Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] has been diagnosed in a western Umatilla County [Oregon] resident. Dr. John Hitzman, who is the county's public health director, is reminding residents to take precautions to prevent exposure to the virus in enclosed areas where mice are nesting.

"Hantavirus [infections cause] a rare but serious disease spread by rodents," Hitzman said. "This disease can frequently become fatal, but there are steps you can take to reduce your exposure."

The person infected contracted the illness through direct contact with mouse droppings, has been hospitalized and is now recovering, according to Umatilla County Public Health Director Meghan DeBolt. The syndrome was diagnosed around Christmas [late December 2015], and it's the 1st case of HPS in the county.

The virus can be present in the urine, droppings or saliva of wild field mice. Since HPS was 1st identified in 1993, there have been 21 cases in Oregon and 588 nationally. About 2/3rds of Oregon's cases were contracted through direct contact with rodents or rodent droppings. The others were caused through indirect exposure while camping or farming.

The illness starts 1-6 weeks after exposure and symptoms include headache, fever, and muscle aches. That rapidly progresses to severe difficulty in breathing and, in some cases, death.

DeBolt says the most important thing people can do when dealing with areas where contamination by mice is possible is to wear a mask and plastic gloves. The area should be sprayed with a 10 percent bleach solution, and people should wait at least 15 minutes after spraying to clean the area.

Other steps to prevent exposure include keeping food in tightly sealed containers, removing stacked wood, rubbish piles and discarded items from around homes, and sealing any holes where rodents can enter. After dealing with such areas or with dead rodents, wash your hands thoroughly. Contact a [pest- or rodent-control] professional if there are large numbers of rodents in a building.

[The hantavirus responsible for this case was not specified but undoubtedly is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in the western USA, including Oregon. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious, as indicated by the 4 HPS [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] deaths in Colorado last year (2015) and 3 New Mexico fatalities in 2014. The public needs to be aware of the circumstances that lead to risk of virus transmission. This is particularly important during spring and summer, when cabins and other outbuildings that have been closed for several months are reopened and cleaned out, raising dust that may be contaminated with virus from deer mice hosts. Previous posts this year indicate that increased precipitation due to El Nino climate effects may have an effect on mouse habitat, with increased exposure of humans in the region due to related increases in populations of Sin Nombre hantavirus-infected mice (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160116.3942572).
