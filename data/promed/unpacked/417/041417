Russia: outbreak of rotavirus infection in Khabarovsk
-----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of rotavirus infection has been reported among small children
in Khabarovsk. Since Mon 1 Jan 2007, over 170 children under the age of 5
have been admitted to hospitals. This is a number twice as great as usual
at this time of year. Local physicians believe that the virus was spread by
[contaminated] apples and mandarins. These fruits were available in
abundance during New Year celebrations. Health care professionals warned
people not to give these fruits to children. Vladimir Ott, the senior
public health official in the Khabarovsk area, stated that a special
message has been delivered to children's institutions instructing them to
avoid donation of fruits as gifts when planning New Year celebrations. This
advice has been followed and supervised by epidemiologists. The majority of
the patients requiring hospital care were under the age of 5.

[The association of rotavirus infection with specific fruits is unusual and
must be presumed to be the result of direct fecal contamination of produce
or a consequence of washing in fecal-contaminated water. - Mod.CP]

Russia: outbreak of rotavirus infection in Krasnoyarsk
------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of rotavirus infection has been recorded in Zelenogorsk. In the
past week, more than 40 people have been affected. All kindergarten and
healthcare facilities have received appropriate instructions, including
preventive messages. Local epidemiologists consider the outbreak to be
foodborne and state that it mainly affects children under 2 years of age
and the elderly. Often, rotavirus infection is a precursor to an outbreak
of influenza.

[In the past 2 months, there has been a seasonal increase of rotavirus
morbidity in the Moscow, Svedlovsk, Orlovskaya, and Khabarovsk regions, in
the Republic of Karelia, and in the Yamalo-Nenetsk autonomous district.
Sporadic cases were detected also during the summer [2006] but, as a rule,
this is an infection associated with cold weather. Rotavirus infection is
spread by fecal-oral transmission and by contamination of food and water.
Currently, after initial problems, at least one vaccine has completed
clinical trials and is available for control of rotavirus infection in
children.
The Khabarovsk region of Russia is in far eastern Siberia. It is bordered
on the east by the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan (East Sea), on the
south by the Primorye Territory, and on the south west by China. The
Khabarovsk region covers a total area of about 824 600 sq km, and it has a
coastline of about 2500 km, which includes the coastline of the Shantar
Islands in the Sea of Okhotsk. The total population is 1 500 000.
Zelenogorsk is a town in the Krasnoyarsk region. The Krasnoyarsk region is
in the East Siberian part of Russia, in the very center of the Eurasian
continent. Its total area is 2 340 000 sq km, or 13.6 per cent of the
territory of Russia. Its territory stretches from the Arctic Ocean to the
mountain regions of southern Siberia, almost 3000 km. More than 3 million
people live in the Krasnoyarsk Territory (2 per cent of Russia's total
population). The Krasnoyarsk region has borders with the Republic of Tyva
in the south, with the Kemerovo region in the south west, and with the
Republics of Khakassia and Kemerovo, the Tomsk region, Khanty-Mansiyskiy,
and Yamalo-Nenezkiy autonomic districts in the west, with the Tymen region
in the north west and with the Irkutsk region in the east. - Mod.NP
