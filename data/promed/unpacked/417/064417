[re: ProMED-mail Tick-borne encephalitis - Sweden 20100620.2072]
----------------------------------------------------------------
Recent reports highlight the fact that Sweden has the highest rate of
tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in Scandinavia, exceeding even those of
Russia in 2008 (1,2). See graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/TBE-Sweden.png>.

The following background data on TBE in Sweden have been abstracted
from the Gideon Database.

Time and place
--------------
- Disease rates peak during July to August.
- Natural foci are found throughout the southern and middle parts of
Sweden up to the counties of Varmland and Dalarna and further north
along the Baltic sea.
- Cases are identified on the Stockholm archipelago, the middle and
eastern parts of Lake Malaren close to Stockholm, the coastal area of
the Baltic sea from Stockholm further south to the city of Kalmar and
the islands of Oland and Gotland.
- Highest incidence is found on the East Coast, (particularly on the
Stockholm archipelago), the eastern region of Lake Malaren and the
Gotland Island region.
- The 1st cases in Skane were reported in 2001. 6 cases were reported
in the region to 2006.
- 65.3 percent of cases reported during 1992 to 1996 were acquired in
Stockholm, 15.2 percent in Sodermanland, 6 percent from Ostergotland
or Gotland, and 4.9 percent from other countries (primarily Finland).
- 402 cases of TBE were registered during 1955 to 1993, with a
case/fatality rate of 0.5 percent. During this period, the disease
rate in Stockholm County was 3.4 per 100 000 per year.
- 71 percent of cases in 2001 were reported from Stockholm, Uppsala,
and Sodermanland.
- 56 percent of cases in 2003 were from Stockholm, 15 percent from
Sodermanland, and 6 percent from Uppsala.
- In 2007, TBE virus was the most common agent of viral meningitis in
Sweden, accounting for 37.4 percent of cases.

The male/female ratio among TBE patients is 2.1/1; and the median
patient age is 41.5 years.

Exported cases
--------------
- Tickborne encephalitis was documented in a Swedish national in
England (1991 publication).
- An American traveler acquired tickborne encephalitis in Sweden in 2006.

Prevalence surveys
------------------
- 21 percent of adult aseptic meningitis in Northern Stockholm (1999 and 2004).

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 4 percent to 22 percent in endemic areas, and 5 percent Stockholm
- 3.5 percent on the island of Asp (Southeast Sweden) in 1991; 12
percent in 2002
- 0.8 percent of persons in northeastern Skane are seropositive.

Tickborne encephalitis virus has been identified in _Ixodes ricinus_
found on migrating passerine birds.
