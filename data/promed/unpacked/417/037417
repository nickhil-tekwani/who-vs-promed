There is a high risk of an outbreak of the devastating fungal disease known as black pod in cocoa crops in West Africa, according to agricultural weather consultancy Climate42. A higher-than-average risk is forecast everywhere except for northern Cameroon. A lower cocoa production in Africa is expected in the 2021/22 season.

Wetter-than-normal conditions allowed the fungus to survive in plantations during the shorter dry season and accelerated the spread of the disease. Continuing wet conditions would pose a serious threat to the late crop because infected pods will stay on the trees longer, allowing for further pathogen spread. Farmers should check their crops constantly to detect possible outbreaks early and apply control measures.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal disease affecting cocoa worldwide. In Africa, the fungus-like pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated with it, but 2 additional species are found in the Americas. _P. palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses as high as 95% in very humid climates, with every pod affected. Pods progressively turn dark brown. Losses are most severe when pods are infected during the 2 months prior to ripening. The disease also causes stem cankers, which are estimated to kill up to 10% of trees annually.

Black pod is spread by insect activity, mechanical means, plant debris, water, and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations, with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci simultaneously. Genetic resistance is generally low in commercial cocoa cultivars. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach including cultural techniques, phytosanitary measures, and targeted fungicide use.

To prevent problems with rain wash-off of foliar fungicides, trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be an effective alternative. However, like chemical sprays, they need to be repeated whenever protection is required. Similar methods are being used in the control of _P. cinnamomi_ diseases in some tree species, for example jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in Australia. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
