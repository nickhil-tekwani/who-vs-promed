Slaughtered: --

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: the owner of the pig farm located in
Waryong-myun found FMD suspicious clinical signs in the herds and
reported the incident to the local veterinary service on 26 Nov 2010.
The local veterinary service conducted tests on the same day using
the penside test kit and the results were negative. On 28 Nov 2010,
the owner of the same farm noticed blisters and ulcers in his herds
and similar signs in the adjacent pig farm, and reported the incident
to the National Veterinary Research & Quarantine Service (NVRQS). The
NVRQS received samples from the 2 farms in question, and confirmed
FMD positive using both antigen detection ELISA and RT-PCR tests on
29 Nov 2010. The serotype will be confirmed pending further testing.
Various disease control measures have been implemented in those farms
including movement restrictions, disinfection, stamping-out, and
epidemiological investigation has been started.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside
the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of
affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Research & Quarantine
Service (national laboratory)
Species: swine
Test: antigen (Ag) detection ELISA
Test date: 29 Nov 2010
Result: positive

Species: swine
Test: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Test date: 29 Nov 2010
Result: positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[There are a couple of noteworthy items in this OIE notification of
FMD in South Korea. First, they have not indicated that the exposed
pigs on either farm have been slaughtered yet. I suspect this a fast
moving situation and the exposed pigs will be destroyed quickly as
that is the only choice consistent with a stamping out policy, which
is what is indicated in this report.

Second, the fact that the penside test was negative on 26 Nov 2010
highlights the fact that the control of an explosive disease like
foot-and-mouth disease depends on the coordinated action of many
individuals and the appropriate use of technical tools. Each entity
must do its job and do it well. In this case, it appears as if the
penside test was likely a false negative test. Hopefully, the
coordinated actions of an alert farmer noticing and reporting
clinical sign of FMD, good laboratory back up with ELISA and RT-PCR
tests at the National Veterinary Research & Quarantine Service
(NVRQS) Laboratories, and quarantines imposed by NVRQS will prevent
further spread of this outbreak.

It is indeed unfortunate that previous efforts to eradicate the
disease and regain the ability to export have taken a step backwards.
ProMED-mail will look forward to further updates to confirm slaughter
of exposed pigs and find out the serotype involved to ascertain if
this outbreak is another one associated with FMDV serotype O -
topotype SEA, strain Mya-98, which has caused so many problems this
year (2010) in the region. Mod.AS' comments from yesterday's posting
(Foot & mouth disease - S Korea (08): (KB) recurs, RFI 20101129.4296)
are copied below as they summarize the situation very nicely. - Mod.PC]

[South Korea suffered, earlier in 2010, 3 FMD events:

1. FMDV serotype A was recorded in Gyeonggi-do province on 2 Jan
2010, causing 7 outbreaks affecting cattle (6 locations) and deer
(one location). No swine were, reportedly, affected. The outbreak was
declared as resolved on 11 Mar 2010.

2. FMDV serotype O was recorded in the province/island
Incheon-Jikhalsi on 8 Apr 2010, causing 8 outbreaks affecting cattle,
swine, and goats. This outbreak was reportedly resolved on 7 Jun 2010.

3. FMDV serotype O was recorded in Chungcheongbuk-do province (1
outbreak) on 21 Apr 2010, spreading to the adjacent province of
Chungcheongnam-do (4 outbreaks), causing a total of 5 outbreaks
involving cattle, swine, and captive wild boars. This outbreak was
reportedly resolved on 19 Jun 2010.

The FMDV serotype O involved in 2 of the (geographically separated)
events above, has been designated to be topotype SEA, strain Mya-98.
The same strain was involved, during 2010, in outbreaks in Hong Kong
SAR, Japan, Mongolia, and Russia. In light of the current outbreak
affecting swine, it is likely to be caused by serotype O as well;
serotyping and genotyping are anticipated with interest, as well as
data on the possible origin of the virus and its route of introduction.
