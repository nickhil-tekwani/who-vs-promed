Over 900 Ill After China Vaccine, Officials Nabbed
-------------------------------------------
Nearly 1000 schoolchildren were rushed to hospital after being vaccinated
for encephalitis in northeast China, local officials said on Friday.
The students, aged between 7 and 16, suffered from fevers, nausea, vomiting
and, in a few cases, heart infections soon after being vaccinated in late
June [2002], a health official from the Heilongjiang province city of
Mishan told Reuters. Initial examinations found nothing wrong with the
vaccine, but samples have been sent to Beijing for further tests, she said
from the city near the Russian border.
"A total of 8300 students took the vaccine for [Japanese] encephalitis B
and now more than 900 are in hospital," she said. A doctor at a local
hospital said some of the students were seriously ill.
Police and prosecutors in the area said the director of the Mishan Epidemic
Prevention Station, which carried out the injections, and a deputy chief of
the city Education Bureau, had been arrested and charged with negligence. A
police officer in Mishan said outraged parents staged demonstrations. "They
massed in front of the city government building to protest and even blocked
some railway lines earlier this month, but now they have calmed down," he said.

[According to the Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, 2000 edition,
the Japanese encephalitis vaccines most widely used in China are live
attenuated and formalin inactivated vaccines made in primary hamster kidney
cells, whereas the vaccine commercially available in the USA and
recommended to travelers to endemic areas for extended visits is an
inactivated vaccine made in mouse brain. This does have side effects, and
also costs around US $450 for the series! However, I am not aware that
"heart infections" are among its side effects. - Mod.JW]
[Information on reported side effects of the various types of Japanese
encephalitis vaccines available can be found on the WHO website
(<http://www.who.int/vaccines-diseases/safety/infobank/japenc.shtml>). The
most common reactions were allergic reactions.
More information from official sources on this adverse event following
vaccinations would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
