FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - IRAQ: (AL-BASRA)

A local official in Basra Province, 600 km south of Baghdad, said on
7 Feb 2008 that there has been an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) in the province.

"As of 26 Jan 2009, our tests found that 1125 animals were infected
with the disease in the entire province, while some cases started to
appear in nearby provinces," Dr Mushtaq Abdul-Mahdi al-Hilfi, general
director of the province's veterinary hospital, said.

"But we do believe that the number of cases is higher than this;
probably slightly more than 50 percent of the province's nearly 120
000 livestock have been affected because many cases in remote areas
have gone unreported," al-Hilfi told IRIN.

So far, the FMD outbreak has killed about 80 young (less than 6
months old) cattle, buffalos, goats and sheep, al-Hilfi said.

He said that there are 5 types of the disease and that the available
vaccine, which is given to livestock every 6 months, can treat only 2
of them. Al-Hilfi added that infected animals are given antibiotics
and pain-killers until the disease type is determined.

"We have already sent samples to laboratories in London to determine
which type has hit Basra, and we are expecting to receive the results
and new vaccines within the coming few days," he added.

He explained that most cattle owners, especially those who live in
remote areas, have difficulties traveling to the city to report FMD
cases, and his teams are unable to reach them as his hospital has
only 2 old vehicles.

FMD causes sores, blisters and fever, and is deadly or debilitating
for livestock. It does not infect humans, but its appearance on farms
can have a major economic impact.

However, Dr Sabah Jassim, the general director of the Basra-based
Veterinary Company, which is affiliated with the Agriculture
Ministry, played down al-Hilfi's statements.

"It is an endemic disease in Iraq, and it is normal; it is a disease
like other diseases that hit animals. The Iraqi Agriculture Ministry
is adopting a scientific plan to deal with it," Jassim told IRIN
without elaborating. He blamed the cattle owners for not sending
their cattle for routine tests and vaccinations.

[In a previous posting on the suspected FMD spread in the Basra area,
dated 19 Jan 2009, the national veterinary service was cited as
announcing that "sufficient vaccine doses are available in most
veterinary hospitals across the country." It is of importance to note
which FMDV serotype has been identified in the current epizootic and
which serotypes are included in the vaccine applied in Iraq.

According to the information available on the website of the World
Reference Laboratory for FMD, Pirbright, FMD is endemic in Iraq, the
1st outbreaks on record being of serotypes A (1952), O (1957), SAT1
(1962), and Asia 1 (1975) and the most recent reports being of
serotypes A (2002), O (2000), SAT 1 (1962?) and Asia 1 (1975); see at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/irq.htm>.

The most recent animal health report was submitted by Iraq to the OIE
(World Organisation for Animal Health) in 2004.

A map of Iraq is available at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=99532&v=33.494,43.819,6>.

FMD has recently been suspected or confirmed in 3 additional Middle
Eastern countries, namely Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Israel. It will be
interesting to obtain their final observations as well as information
from other countries in the region, such as Iran, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey.

Official notification to the OIE has been submitted by Israel on 4
Feb 2009, when serotyping was "pending." We are informed that in the
meantime, the Israeli isolate has been identified as serotype O.

The disease is known to be seasonal in Israel; it will be interesting
to note whether similar seasonality is observed in other
Middle-Eastern countries. The background to the said seasonality has
not yet been elucidated, though in Israel, the suspected possible
involvement of wild boars has been discussed. - Mod.AS]
