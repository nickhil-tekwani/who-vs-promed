Representatives of Georgian National Food Agency revealed the fact of sale of health-hazardous products at Central Agricultural Market [Dezertirebi] in Tbilisi.

Due to this case, a section for meat sales closed at the market "Dezertirebi 2012", the Agency told to Trend on [Fri 23 Aug 2013].

The inspection was carried out after a citizen, who bought meat at this market, fell ill with anthrax. Currently he is undergoing hospital treatment.

The meat was sent to the laboratory for study.

The Agency has determined that the salesman purchased 15 kilos [33 lb] of meat at Navtlug market, and bypassing the laboratory and without the form no. 2, brought it to the market "Dezertirebi 2012." Individual entrepreneur GS, the renter of the section for meat sales was fined 1000 lari (USD 602 at 1.66 lari to the USD).

The meat sales stopped at the market [until disinfection work is completed].

[This is a too common event of careless marketing in Georgia and it demonstrates an unfortunate separation of the public health services from the veterinary services. It is the efficient functioning of the latter in livestock control, vaccination, and surveillance that results in zero human cases. Not the other way around. If you cannot stop livestock cases, you just continue to have more and more human cases. A butchered carcass results in 2-3 people exposed doing the skinning and butchering, then you have the dozens of people exposed in the market stalls selling and handling the contaminated meat, and even more clients buying the meat. Efficient livestock vaccination is the most cost effective means of reducing outbreaks and, when done right, it results in anthrax eradication ... a secondary benefit of proper control of this disease. - Mod.MHJ
