Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Contact with wild species.

Epidemiological comments: Cases in wild birds: Wakayama-City 1; A dead _Aix galericulata_ (Mandarin Duck) was collected on [3 Dec 2020] and tested against avian influenza virus. The Tottori University conducted RT-PCR and gene sequencing tests and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8. Yakage-Town 1; a dead _Falco peregrinus_ (Peregrine Falcon) was collected on [4 Dec 2020] and tested against avian influenza virus. The Tottori University conducted RT-PCR and gene sequencing tests and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8. Mitoyo-City 1; a dead _Buteo japonicus_ (Eastern buzzard) was collected on [8 Dec 2020] and tested against avian influenza virus. The Tottori University conducted RT-PCR and gene sequencing tests and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8. Izumi-City 1; a dead _Grus monachal_ (Hooded crane) was collected on [18 Dec 2020] and tested against avian influenza virus. The Kagoshima University conducted RT-PCR and gene sequencing tests and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N8. Enhanced monitoring of wild birds is ongoing within a 10km [approx. 0.6mi] radius around the sites.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

[Wild birds can normally carry AI viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick, which allow them to carry the viruses on long distances along their migration flyways.
