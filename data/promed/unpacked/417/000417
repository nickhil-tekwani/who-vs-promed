Darjeeling Hills is in the grip of an encephalitis outbreak characterised by high fever, headaches, and behaviour disturbances and personality changes, which lead to coma in extreme cases. Three deaths have been reported. In the last 24 hours, the Darjeeling Sadar Hospital has received around 100 patients with very high fever.

Cases of herpetic meningoencephalitis, a form of encephalitis caused by the herpes simplex Type 1, Type 2 virus, have been confirmed. The disease has a high mortality rate if not diagnosed quickly.

"Since many of the early symptoms are flu-like (headache, dizziness, vomiting), it is easy to misdiagnose the condition until it is too late. If there is a wrong diagnosis, the chances of death are as high as 70 per cent," said Dr Plaban Das, director, Darjeeling and Dooars Medical Association (DDMA).

The DDMA has had 3 deaths in the past 3 weeks. "These patients were brought to the DDMA in the coma stage. The 1st case was registered on 18 May [2013] when a 54-year-old man was admitted. He was in coma. We diagnosed him with herpectic meningoencephalitis and administered Acyclovir injection. The blood samples were sent to Delhi for confirmatory tests. The test results were positive. However, the patient responded to treatment and recovered. He has now been discharged," said Das.

Around 20 patients have been cured and discharged in the last 3 weeks. The dead include a 58-year-old from Jorebungalow who died on 13 Jun [2013] and a 73-year-old from Lebong who died 2 weeks ago. The 1st death registered was a 50-year-old about 2 weeks ago.

"Last year [2012], there was a similar outbreak in September 2012. The change in weather triggers a mutation in viral morphology, and as the human immunity system cannot counter this changed morphology, there is an outbreak," said Das. He has already notified the district magistrate, the chief medical officer of health [CMOH] and the chairman of the Darjeeling Municipality [There is no evidence that weather alters virus morphology or antigenicity. Weather can alter human behavior in a way that facilitates person-to-person transmission of viruses, however. - Mod.TY].

When contacted, chief medical officer of health Subir Bhowmik said: "We have large number of cases with symptoms of high fever. At this time, such outbreaks usually occur but are self limiting. Children are vulnerable. We have taken all necessary steps to counter this outbreak." However, the CMOH did not categorise the outbreak as herpectic meningoencephalitis.

[Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a life-threatening result of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the central nervous system (CNS). HSE is rare, but mortality rates can reach 70 per cent. Without therapy, a minority of individuals who survive return to normal function. Antiviral therapy is most effective when started early, necessitating prompt diagnosis.

It seems unusual that there has been a cluster of reported herpesvirus encephalitis cases seasonally this year (2013) and last (2012), raising questions about the etiology in all these cases as indicated by the local CMOH. ProMED-mail moderators DK and MPP noted that all age groups are susceptible to herpesvirus encephalitis, but the frequency of occurrence is low (perhaps one case per million population, see ProMED-mail archive no. 20061105.3179). The mention of the vulnerability of children to encephalitis in the report above suggests another viral etiology, such as Japanese encephalitis virus.
