A bird 'flu [avian influenza] outbreak on an Ontario turkey farm was caused by the same virus that has triggered outbreaks in British Columbia [BC] and 9 US states since late last year [2014], the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] announced yesterday [8 Apr 2015].

The culprit is a highly pathogenic H5N2 virus, said CFIA vice-president Paul Mayers, who noted Canada would inform the World Organization for Animal Health, known as the OIE, about the finding.

Under international regulations, countries must notify the OIE when they have outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird 'flu viruses because these can devastate poultry operations. OIE rules also allow countries to ban poultry imports from affected countries. Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Uruguay already have imposed trade sanctions as a result of the Ontario outbreak and Mayers said more may follow.

To date, 10 countries still have in place bans on poultry from Canada because of the BC outbreak, which began in December [2014]. Mayers said quarantines have been lifted on all the farms that were affected in that outbreak in the Fraser Valley.

But while it appears to be over, Canada had not yet been declared bird 'flu-free -- and now won't be until the Ontario outbreak is extinguished.

The outbreak is on an unidentified turkey farm near Woodstock, Ontario. Updated numbers for that operation released by CFIA indicate more than 10 000 birds have died so far.

The remaining 34 000 turkeys will be humanely euthanized in an effort to arrest spread of the virus, Mayers said.

The CFIA has quarantined that farm and 8 others, which are close by or are deemed at high risk of spread because of contact between the operations. But to date, the virus only has been detected on the one farm.

The virus is a new hybrid, containing the hemagglutinin gene -- the H in a 'flu virus' name -- from an H5N1 virus that has been decimating poultry flocks in Asia since late 2003.

The H5N2 virus has a neuraminidase (the N in a 'flu virus' name) that is found in wild birds in North America.

The arrival of a virus containing the Asian H5 gene -- first spotted in December [2014] -- was a surprise.

Years of wild bird surveillance suggested there was no mingling of 'flu viruses between the Eurasian bird flyways and those of the Americas.

"These highly-pathogenic viruses never crossed the big oceans before," said Dr Ruben Donis, associate director for policy evaluation and preparedness in the US Centers for Disease Control's influenza division.

"This kind of intercontinental transmission of highly-pathogenic viruses, this is unprecedented," he noted.

This H5N2 virus has not yet been seen to have infected people.

H5N1 viruses have; the World Health Organization says 784 people in 16 countries are known to have been infected since 2003 and 429 of them have died.

But all H5N1 viruses are not identical. They are a family of viruses.

And the branch this particular H5 belongs to has not often infected people in Asia, Donis noted.

[The continued spread of this virus in Canada and the US is concerning on many levels. One has to feel for producers who see so many of their animals, and their livelihood affected by this disease. Furthermore, this can have an impact on the consumer market as well.
