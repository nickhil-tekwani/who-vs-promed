Tuberculosis in cattle up 28 percent
------------------------------------
The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) among cattle has soared by 28
percent, according to the latest DEFRA statistics. Provisional
statistics show a 24 percent increase in the number of new TB
incidents in the 1st 9 months of 2008 compared to the same period in
2007. Combined with a decrease in the number of herds tested over the
same period, this equates to a provisional overall increase in the TB
incidence rate of 28 percent.

Monthly bovine TB figures were released by DEFRA on Wednesday (19 Nov
2008). They suggest some 47 564 tests will be carried out on herds
during 2008, resulting in 3379 new herd incidents. The statistics
prompted the Liberal Democrats to call on the government rethink its
policy on bovine TB and badger culling.

Lib Dem shadow DEFRA secretary Roger Williams said: "These figures
will be of major concern to livestock farmers. Not only has there
been an increase in the incidences of bovine TB but the number of
tests has decreased, which could be masking an even bigger problem."

A government-backed vaccine to combat bovine TB in cattle is unlikely
to be available until 2015.

Mr Williams said: "By the time the vaccine is available for
widespread use it may be too late for many livestock farmers. I urge
the government to rethink its policy."

[DEFRA's provisional bovine TB statistics for Great Britain from 1
Jan 2008 to 31 Aug 2008, as updated on 18 Nov 2008, are available in
6 pdf tables (Great Britain, West Region, North Region, East Region,
Wales, and Scotland) which are accessible at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/stats/latest.htm>.

According to the said tables, the total current number of cattle
herds registered in Great Britain is 87 909, of which 5129 herds
(5.83 percent) were under TB2 restrictions because of a TB incident
at some time during the said period. This is an unusually high
incidence for a west-European country. When viewing the separate
tables addressing each region, a relatively high incidence becomes
apparent in the West (17.94 percent), where the highest rates are
seen in Cornwall (21.24 percent) and Devon (20.78 percent). Wales is
also highly infected (10.97 percent), compared to the North (2.1
percent), East (2.03 percent) and Scotland (0.37 percent). The total
GB table presents also comparative 2007 data.

The Web site includes the following explanatory points related to the
interpretation of the bovine TB statistics:

1. Data are extracted from the Animal Health (formerly SVS) database
(via Vetnet / TB Data Warehouse) on the date specified in the
footnotes to the each table.
2. All data are provisional, subject to change as more data becomes available.
3. The data provided are broken down for each of the 5 former Animal
Health regions, as defined by the Animal Health database. Each region
is further broken down by the Animal Health Divisional Offices
(AHDOs) within that region.
4. In addition, county level data are provided for those counties of
England in areas with a higher than average incidence of bTB:
Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Avon, Wiltshire,
Hereford and Worcester, Shropshire, Derbyshire, Cheshire and Staffordshire.
5. Data for the former Animal Health Divisions of North Wales and
South Wales have also been broken down to county level.
6. A proportion of bTB incidents remain unclassified, awaiting the
results of culture tests which can take several months. Therefore the
number of confirmed incidents will currently be under-recorded. For
instance, 6.17 percent of new bTB incidents in January - August 2008
were unclassified when the data were extracted.
7. The number of bTB incidents depends on the number of tuberculin
and gamma interferon tests carried out and on the nature of the
testing regime at the time (as well as on the underlying prevalence
of the disease). During the 2001 FMD outbreak, tuberculin testing was
significantly reduced and necessarily targeted to higher risk herds;
e.g., those tested following routine inspection of animals at
slaughterhouses. At any time, the more herds you test, the more
likely you are to find bTB.
8. Any reactors, inconclusive reactors and direct contacts still
awaiting removal and slaughter on the date of the data download were
not included in the tables. These only show the number of reactors,
inconclusive reactors and direct contacts that had been slaughtered
as at the end of the reporting period.

The deplorably deteriorated bTB situation in the UK has already been
reflected in the introduction of infected animals into importing
farms, elsewhere (see postings 20080718.2186 and 20080909.2813). - Mod.AS]
