Even as local rabies clinics kick off in our area, Hampton County has seen its 1st confirmed case of rabies for 2021, and at least one person was potentially exposed to the dangerous virus.

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) reported this week a skunk found near Prince William Road and Pond Town Road in Brunson, South Carolina has tested positive for rabies. One person was potentially exposed and was referred to their healthcare provider, stated the DHEC release.

The person, a Hampton County man, was at a low risk for exposure and did not require treatment, a family member told The Guardian on Thursday [19 Aug 2021]. The family's dog was not exposed.

The skunk was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 13 Aug 2021, and was confirmed to have rabies on 16 Aug 2021.

DHEC advises the public to please report all animal bites, scratches, and exposures to potentially rabid animals to their agency.

"It is very important for you to seek medical attention if you have been exposed to a wild, stray, or domestic animal. The rabies virus is found in the saliva of infected animals and can be transmitted through a bite, scratch, broken skin, and the mucous membranes of your eyes, nose, or mouth. Immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader. "Contact your local Environmental Affairs office for further guidance."

If you believe you, someone you know, or pets have come into contact with this skunk [or any skunk - Mod.TG] or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Beaufort office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or on the after hours and on holidays number (Select Option 2).

This skunk is the 1st animal in Hampton County to test positive for rabies in 2021, according to DHEC. There have been 53 cases of rabid animals statewide this year. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year. In 2020, none of the 168 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Hampton County.

DHEC reminds citizens it is important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease.

Pets aged 12 weeks and older are required by state law to be vaccinated, and the Hampton Animal Hospital is doing its part locally to help make this easy and inexpensive for area residents with a series of low-cost clinics around the county which began 13 Aug 2020.

"Due to the coronavirus, we are limiting the number of clinics we will be offering this year," Nina Getridge of Hampton Animal Hospital said. "We are scheduling only our largest clinics, but hopefully we will get back on a regular schedule next year [2022]. We will be following COVID guidelines, and we suggest you wear a mask at these clinics to protect yourself, our staff, and others in the community."

Two of the rabies clinics happened last week, on 13 Aug 2021 at Hampton Animal Hospital and 14 Aug 2021 at Enterprise Bank. The remaining low-cost clinics, priced at USD 8 per rabies vaccination, [took place between 20 and 28 Aug 2021]

More about rabies
-----------------
Rabies is a virus (_Lyssavirus_) that can be transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body of a healthy person or animal. It infects cells in the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and, ultimately, death.

Any mammal has the ability to carry and transmit the disease to humans or pets. Rabies is transmitted when saliva or neural tissue of an infected animal is introduced into the body. Exposure can occur through a bite, scratch or contact with saliva to broken skin or mucous membranes such as the eyes or mouth.

In South Carolina, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and bats are the usual suspects when it comes to rabies infections, but pets and livestock can also be infected.

Report animal bites to DHEC
If you're bitten or scratched by a wild, stray or unvaccinated animal, care for the wound properly and contact your health care provider. The health care provider is required to report the incident to DHEC.

If your child is bitten and you do not seek medical treatment for the wound, you are required to contact your regional DHEC Environmental Health Services office to report the incident by the end of the following business day.

[2] USA (South Carolina): skunk, pig, human exposure

The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) confirmed a skunk found near Josh Nicole Drive and Ole Keowee Church Road in Six Mile, South Carolina, has tested positive for rabies. One person was exposed and has been referred to their healthcare provider. One pig was also exposed, and the public health veterinarian has been consulted.

The skunk was submitted to DHEC's laboratory for testing on 25 Aug 2021, and was confirmed to have rabies on 26 Aug 2021.

South Carolina law requires all dogs, cats, and ferrets be vaccinated against rabies and revaccinated at a frequency to provide continuous protection of the pet from rabies using a vaccine approved by the department and licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Similarly, species of livestock are susceptible to rabies; cattle and horses are the most frequently reported infected livestock species; therefore, all livestock with USDA approved rabies vaccinations should be vaccinated. Species for which licensed vaccines are not available (goat and swine), having frequent contact with humans, or are considered valuable, should also be vaccinated.

"Keeping your pets and livestock current on their rabies vaccination is a responsibility coming with owning an animal. It is one of the easiest and most effective ways you can protect yourself, your family, pets, and or livestock from this fatal disease. That is an investment worth making to provide yourself some peace of mind," said Terri McCollister, DHEC's Rabies Program Team Leader.

If you believe you or someone you know, or your pets have come into contact with this skunk [or any skunk - Mod.TG] or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs Greenville office during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday) or there is an after hours and on holidays number, select option 2 on the recording.

It is important to keep pets up to date on their rabies vaccination, as this is one of the easiest and most effective ways to protect against the disease. This skunk is the 1st animal in Pickens County to test positive for rabies in 2021. There have been 59 cases of rabid animals statewide this year. Since 2002, South Carolina has averaged approximately 148 positive cases a year. In 2020, 2 of the 168 confirmed rabies cases in South Carolina were in Pickens County.

[3] USA (North Carolina): dog, raccoon, exposure

https://eu.gastongazette.com/story/news/2021/08/24/raccoon-tests-positive-rabies-gaston-county/8249902002/


Gaston County [North Carolina] has reported its 5th case of rabies in 2021.

On [19 Aug 2021] Gaston County Police Animal Care and Enforcement answered a call at the 400 block of Woodlawn Avenue in Gastonia. The caller reported that a dog, who was reported to be a stray, had killed a raccoon in the backyard of the property.

The raccoon was tested for rabies at the State of North Carolina Virology lab, and on [23 Aug 2021] the raccoon specimen tested positive for rabies.

The family who brought the dog home had no vaccination records. Gaston County Animal Care and Enforcement scanned the animal for a microchip. They then reported back to the area where the family picked the animal up and completed an area canvass for a possible animal owner.

The owner nor the vaccination records were located. The dog was euthanized due to rabies exposure.

Animal Care and Enforcement completed a neighborhood canvas in the area of Woodlawn Avenue to notify the community of the positive rabies result and verify rabies vaccinations for family animals in the area.

Gaston County Animal Care and Enforcement also reported the incident to the Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services so they could complete a follow up investigation.

The Gaston County Police Department Animal Care and Enforcement Unit stressed the importance of having a valid rabies vaccination for all pet's health and safety as well as the health and safety of animal owners and the community.

[4] USA (North Carolina): raccoon, dog exposure
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021 11:58 AM EDT

https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article253715453.html


A crazed raccoon in a Ballantyne [Mecklenburg County] neighborhood exposed families' dogs to the potentially fatal disease, police said.

Residents of High Oaks Lane received an alert Tuesday night [24 Aug 2021] after the raccoon tested positive for the disease, according to the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department Animal Care & Control Division.

High Oaks Lane is south of Ballantyne Commons Parkway in south Charlotte.

The raccoon exposed at least 5 dogs in the neighborhood to rabies, division officials said in a news release.

No humans were believed to have been exposed, but anyone with concerns about potential exposure should call Carson Phillips at 980-314-9214 or Jose Peña at 980-314-9210, division officials said.

It was not immediately known if the south Charlotte dogs had their required vaccinations.

The raccoon was the 8th in Mecklenburg County to test positive for rabies this year [2021], according to Animal Care & Control data. 2 foxes also tested positive, agency data show.

Last year [2020], 9 raccoons, 2 bats, 2 foxes, a skunk, and a cat tested positive, officials said.

In 2019, 16 animals tested positive for rabies, including 8 raccoons, according to the division. In 2018, 14 tested positive, 10 of which were raccoons, officials said.

[5] USA (Illinois): bat, human exposure

Bat bites are on the rise in DuPage County, with the county health department saying at least 5 bats have tested positive for rabies recently.

As CBS 2's Jackie Kostek reported Tuesday night [24 Aug 2021], a total of 55 people were also told they should get treatment for potential exposure.

"It can happen so quickly," said [TT]. "You might not see it."

Taylor is setting off the alarm bells after her adult son was bit by a bat while mowing the lawn Sunday [22 Aug 2021]. "Something hit him in the back, and it was heavy," [TT] said. "He brushed it off and went back to his mowing -- and whatever it was came back and bit him."

[TT's] son didn't want to go on camera, but she said when he told her about the bite, she implored him to get to the hospital. "It's not worth taking a chance," [TT] said. " 'Oh, it probably wasn't.' 'No, just do it. Just do it.' "

[TT's] son did go to Northwestern Medicine's Central DuPage Hospital for treatment -- only to find the treatment had run out.

"Unfortunately, we actually had to pull resources from other hospitals because it depleted our supply of the immunoglobulin," said Dr Jeff Bohmer.

Bohmer is the chairman and medical director of the emergency department at Central DuPage. He said bats are most active this time of year, so it's not necessarily unusual to have patients in for bat exposures.

It was, however, unusual to see several families in just a couple of days.

"Usually it's fairly sporadic," Bohmer said.

The DuPage County Health Department said people need to be on alert, as again, 5 bats have tested positive for rabies so far this year [2021] and 55 people were potentially exposed.

While bats typically live in caves or densely forested areas, doctors say you're most likely to be exposed or bitten in your own home. Bats can fit through a hole the size of a dime.

"Obviously a bat bite, you'll know," Bohmer said. "That nighttime exposure when the person's sleeping is the issue."

While [TT's] son was bitten outside, Dr Bohmer said most exposures happen inside the home. People may not realize they've been exposed if it happens during sleep.

Dr Bohmer said if a bat is found in the home, you should seek medical attention. Treatments include the topical immunoglobulin and a vaccine, which Dr Bohmer said are nearly 100 percent effective.

As for [TT], she says when it comes to bats, it's pretty simple. [I think this means it is a simple decision to get medical treatment for bat bites. - Mod.TG]

[5] Bolivia: increased dog and cat cases, human
Date: Wed 25 Aug 2021 15:36 BOT

https://www.opinion.com.bo/articulo/cochabamba/casos-rabia-duplican-ciocbabamba-municipios-emergencia/20210825153618832520.html


Cases of canine and feline rabies doubled this year [2021] in Cochabamba compared to [the same period last year] and 4 municipalities declared an emergency.

This was confirmed by the head of the rabies program of the Departmental Health Service (SEDES), Ingrid Álvarez, who indicated that 20 cases were reported in 2020 and this year there are already 45 cases and 4 people who died.

Álvarez indicated that in Tarata, Arbieto, Cliza, and Sipe Sipe municipalities an emergency was declared due to the number of cases of canine-feline rabies, which means that each of these municipalities must strengthen prevention measures and guarantee vaccination for pets and for people.

The head of the Epidemiology Unit of the Departmental Health Service (SEDES), Rubén Castillo, explained that the canine and feline population in the department exceeds 600 000. He also announced that on [11 Sep 2021], a massive vaccination campaign for the animals would be carried out to complete or initiate vaccination schedules.

Meanwhile, Álvarez called on the Cochabamba families and urged the population to be more responsible and take their pets to be vaccinated in the health centers of Cercado, or if from other municipalities to go to family hospitals and health centers where they have the rabies vaccine.

There are a variety of animals mentioned in this report, indicating the extent to which rabies virus infects mammals.

This vast variety of animals can present danger to human beings. Our best method or protection is to build a barrier between ourselves and this disease by vaccinating the animals close to us. This includes our dogs, cats, horses, cattle, and yes, even pigs.

Only the article in [1] above mentioned establishing rabies clinics specifically for people to come out to. Often these clinics are underwritten by members of the communities and veterinarians often donate their time so the cost of the vaccine is minimum. This type of rabies drive was formerly more common in communities experiencing rabies in the immediate area. Perhaps it is an idea whose time has returned.

Rabies is fatal to any of our animals getting the disease unless they have a preventative vaccine onboard. There are both 1- and 3-year rabies vaccines. The counties and their level of rabies may determine how often they require the vaccine. ls, please be sure their vaccines are current.

The article from Bolivia reports 45 cases and 4 deaths so far this year (2021). Clearly, the number of both animal and human exposures is increasing in the country. Please be aware of animals when you are traveling in other countries. A bite from a rabid animal can happen anywhere. - Mod.TG]
