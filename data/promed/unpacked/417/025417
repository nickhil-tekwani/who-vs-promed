Brucellosis found in cattle in the Chuvash Republic for the 1st time in 40
years
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For the 1st time in 40 years, brucellosis has been revealed in cattle and
in small ruminants in Chuvashia. Infected animals have been detected in the
agricultural enterprises "Bakhcha," Krasnoarmeysky district and
"Turunovskiy," Cheboksary district.

All cattle and small ruminants in the 2 facilities, over 200, have been
eliminated: 51 cattle and one horse (conditionally healthy animal, which
did not show positive tests for brucellosis) have been slaughtered at the
"OAO Vurnarsky meat plant", while others have been recycled in the SUE
"Tsivilsky vetsanutilzavod" plant. Note that the positive reactions to
brucellosis were detected in 40 sheep and 2 cows.

Brucellosis in animals was recorded in March [2009], after a check-up in
February by experts of the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor). It was revealed that on 25
Dec 2008, 150 [infected?] sheep for breeding were transported with an
invalid veterinary certificate from the agricultural production plant
"Bakhcha" to "Turunovskiy." The veterinary certificate was "backdated,"
avoiding the prescribed quarantine period at the location of origin, which
involves diagnostic tests. In this connection, 149 sheep out of the 150
transported were put in quarantine, sampled, and positive brucellosis
reactors discovered. Chuvashia had been regarded free of brucellosis for
several decades and the "Turunovskiy" plant did not keep sheep before;
therefore, other routes of disease introduction could be regarded improbable.

As to the way the disease penetrated the "Bakhcha" enterprise, [the
epidemiological investigation] revealed that sheep were introduced in 2005
from 7 facilities in the Astrakhan, Yaroslavl, and Ivanovo regions with
severe violations of requirements of normative legal certificates of the
Russian Federation in the field of veterinary science.

[In view of the available information, particularly the involvement of
sheep, it may be assumed that the pathogen involved is _Brucella
melitensis_. Laboratory confirmation is anticipated, preferably with
information on the serovar (there are 3 _B. melitensis_ serovars). The
severe zoonotic nature of _B. melitensis_ calls for caution in handling of
the infected animals and premises. Other domestic animals, including dogs,
should be tested as well; the pathogen mainly infects sheep and goats, but
occasionally also cattle, camels, and dogs, and rarely horses and pigs.
Infections in sheep and goats can spill over into wild ruminants.

_B. melitensis_ is highly pathogenic for humans; this organism is
considered the most severe human pathogen in the genus. Occupational
exposure is seen in farmers, their family members, laboratory workers,
veterinarians, and others who contact infected animals or tissues. Aborted
foeti and vaginal secretions are particularly rich in infective material.
Brucellosis is one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections.
People who do not work with animals or tissues usually become infected by
ingesting unpasteurized dairy products.

The application of recycling of the culled cattle is interesting; it is
indicative of allowing the utilisation of cattle-derived meat and bone meal
in Russia. For which purposes?

Chuvashia is an autonomous republic of western Russia in the Volga River
valley; for its location, see the map at
