Tea farmers in eastern Nepal never had a yield this low. First, diseases such as leaf curl and black tip attacked the crops. Already struggling with rising pest infestations, then heavy rainfall across much of the country swept away a portion of the crop.

So far in 2020, Nepal has seen a 30-40% decline in its tea harvest compared with a year ago, according to the National Tea and Coffee Development Board (NTCDB). Short bursts of intense rainfall have become more common, water-logging fields and causing defects in the tea plants.

[Tea (_Camellia sinensis_) can be affected by a number of fungi, as well as some bacterial, nematode, and viral pathogens causing diseases of leaves, stems, and roots. The most important leaf disease in tea cultivation in Southeast Asia is blister blight (caused by the fungus _Exobasidium vexans_). However, it is not clear, which diseases or disorders may be referred to above as 'black tip' and 'leaf curl'.

High humidity, as described above, is conducive for the development of many pathogens, as well as for an increase in insect populations, including potential specific or unspecific pathogen vectors. Reliable diagnosis of any potential pathogens involved in problems on any crop is vital for establishing effective disease management strategies.
