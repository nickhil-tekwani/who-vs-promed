The News Office of the Ministry of Agriculture announced an outbreak
of imported Type O Foot & Mouth Disease [FMD] in Yuzhong County, Gansu.

On 14 Mar 2010, an outbreak of suspected FMD occurred in Heping
Township of Yuzhong County in Lanzhou City of Gansu Province. 206 hogs
were sick and 7 died. On 30 Mar 2010, the National FMD Reference
Laboratory confirmed Type O FMD virus.

After the outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture and Gansu Provincial
Government implemented emergency response plans and organized disease
response efforts. The area was sealed, and culling and disinfection
were carried out in accordance with the law. 1089 sick hogs and hogs
from the same herd were culled and safely disposed of, and the
outbreak has been brought under effective control.

[The above outbreak is the subject of an official Chinese notification
to the OIE, submitted 30 Mar 2010, available with map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9095>.

This is follow-up report No 2 concerning the FMDV serotype O outbreak
which, reportedly, started in China on 22 Feb 2010, thus far from 3
foci, including the current one. All 3 outbreaks affected swine farms.
While the 1st 2 outbreaks occurred in Guandong, the 3rd one is located
in Gansu, more than 2000 km northwest of Guandong. This, and the fact
that FMDV serotype O is generally known to be a fast-spreading
(invasive) virus, may be suggestive of a wider dissemination of this
virus than reported.

Another FMDV serotype (A) has been reported to be spreading in bovines
since early 2009. There was also a single report on serotype Asia 1 in
bovines -- see ProMED archives below. - Mod.AS]
