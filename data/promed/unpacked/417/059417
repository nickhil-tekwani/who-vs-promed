Brazil reports one non-fatal case of plague from Serrinha municipality,
Bahia State, with date of 2 Nov 2000.

[Bahia State is an endemic focus of plague, & sporadic cases have been
reported from there for years. WHO often labels reports such as these as
having no implications for international travel.
Plague is one of the 3 diseases -- the others are cholera & yellow fever --
which countries are obligated to report to WHO within 24 hours of even a
suspicion of a case. While a late report is better than none at all --
nobody wants to see countries suppressing identification of a case because
they are late reporting it -- it is of little use to public health. A
timely report would have alerted local physicians to consider plague as an
alternative diagnosis in febrile patients, and travel doctors in other
countries to consider plague in febrile tourists returning from travel in
Bahia, Brazil. We may now never know whether absence of reports of
subsequent cases from the same focus is due to delays in reporting, or lack
of recognition because there was no index of suspicion among physicians at
the time. - Mod.JW]
