Swine flu situation grave in 5 states
-------------------------------------
The swine flu [influenza A (H5N1)] situation continues to be serious
in the 4 southern states [Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra
Pradesh) and Maharashtra, which have reported 366 of the 370 H1N1
infections in the last week, official figures show.

Kerala remains the worst affected state with 222 confirmed reports of
swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1) virus infection]. A rise in
number of swine flu cases has been reported from all severely
affected states with Maharashtra reporting 72 cases, Karnataka 31,
Tamil Nadu 22, and Andhra Pradesh 19. During the last week [week of
28 Jun - 2 Jul 2010] 16 people have died due to this virus
[infection], with 10 of these being reported from Kerala, 4 from
Maharashtra and 2 from Andhra Pradesh.

"With the launch of our 1st indigenous swine flu vaccine, we are
definitely better prepared to handle the threat. We will be having 3
more vaccines soon," a health ministry official said. However when
asked about the growing number of infections in the southern part of
the country and the unpopularity of the vaccine, the official said
that lack of awareness was to be blamed. "There is lack of awareness
about the vaccine. Even though the stocks are there not many are
willing to take the vaccine," the official said.

A total of 3 cases of swine flu have also been reported from Gujarat,
while one case was reported from Uttar Pradesh last week. The
national capital has so far been more or less free from the virus
with only 3 minor cases being reported in over 2 months.

India's 1st indigenous swine flu vaccine was launched by Zydus Cadila
last month [June 2010]. The vaccine has however not proved to be
popular till now with people and even health professionals being
unaware and uncertain about its benefits and implications.

[It is likely that the distribution of pandemic (H1N1) influenza
cases in India is a reflection of the greater severity of the effects
of the monsoon season in the central and southern states of the
country.
