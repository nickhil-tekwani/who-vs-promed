[The following comment has been received in response to the ProMED-mail
posting:
CJD (new var.) - UK: update Oct 2002 20021007.5492
where it was observed by the moderator that the total number of definite or
probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) had increased by one since the previous
monthly report. This was not intended to suggest that the incidence of the
disease is in decline. The most recent quarterly analysis by N .J. Andrews
of the PHLS Statistics Unit (15 Jul 2002, URL below) concludes that: "The
distributions of disease onsets and deaths over time continue to show a
significant increase, with onsets increasing by 18 percent per year, and
deaths by 20 percent per year for 1994-2001. The estimated current rate of
onsets is 8.1 per quarter and deaths is 7.0 per quarter. There has been a
decrease in the delay from onset to diagnosis of about 5 percent per year
with the current delay estimated at 10 months." This report is accompanied
by graphical presentation of the data which should be consulted by anyone
unconvinced. <http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/cjdq34.htm> - Mod.CP]

Any assumptions about the vCJD 'epidemic' being on the wane should be
tempered for the time being. At the September 2002 meeting of SEAC [the UK
government's advisory committee on spongiform encephalopathies] it was
indicated that all of the affected persons who had been examined had been
found to be Met/Met [homozygotes] at codon 129 [of the prion protein gene].
Until it is known whether other groups [genotypes] are affected later or
not, it would be premature to base any 'it's on the way out' claims on the
current data.
