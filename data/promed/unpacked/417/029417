Dear Colleagues,

Thanks to the generosity of many ProMED subscribers, it has been another busy year for ProMED. We have posted over 3000 reports of infectious diseases. We have followed stories in depth, bringing our readers frequent updates on long-standing global health threats including dengue, measles and hantavirus and on newly discovered diseases like the novel coronavirus. We've provided context and scientific depth on babesiosis and botulism, rabies and scabies.

Because of your past generosity, ProMED has expanded its reach and enhanced the breadth of its coverage. ProMED-mail networks in Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America have increased the flow and timeliness of news and information from these regions. To bring this information to as wide an audience as possible, we make ProMED available in 5 languages. Today, thanks to the generosity our supporters, ProMED reaches a community of over 64 000 participants in every country at every level of government and non-government organizations and the general public. Thanks to those who contribute to ProMED financially, we have done a lot, but there is so much more that needs to be done.

I am writing to ask you to please support ProMED not only with your readership and words but with a monetary gift. Your support now will help ensure that ProMED continues to meet the information needs of the international infectious disease community. For those in the US, this is the last day to make a contribution that is deductible from your 2012 income taxes.

No other source provides the accurate, relevant, and timely infectious disease reporting that ProMED provides each day. Covering the entire One Health spectrum of human, animal, and crop plant diseases, ProMED brings you news and unique, expert interpretation that informs you about the disease and helps you understand how it might affect you, your family, your business, and your plans. No other source keeps you so well informed on topics you need and want to know about. No other source covers the topic of infectious diseases so broadly, deeply, and internationally. No other source provides it free of charge.

Except, of course, it is not free. We give access to it for free, but the level and quality of service ProMED provides you is expensive. ProMED has been widely recognized for the truthfulness and scope of its reporting and the depth of its commentary, but our expanded services have made your financial support even more important. Our year-end fundraising efforts pay for over 25 percent of ProMED's operating expenses. We really can't do it without you.

Best wishes for a happy and healthy New Year!
