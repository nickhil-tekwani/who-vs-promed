Two reports from the western US describe outbreaks of infection with
_Salmonella typhimurium_ definitive phage type (DT) 104 associated with the
consumption of Mexican-style soft cheese made with unpasteurised milk,
which arose early in 1997. In northern California the identification of an
outbreak of 31 cases infected with _S. typhimurium_ var Copenhagen,
resistant to five antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin,
sulphonamides, and tetracycline (ACSSuT)) and indistinguishable by pulsed
field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), prompted a case control study, which
identified a significant association with eating unpasteurised
Mexican-style cheese bought from small Hispanic markets. Enhanced
surveillance set up throughout California as a result of this outbreak
uncovered a second outbreak associated with the same vehicle but a
different strain of _S. typhimurium_ (DT 104b), with the same resistance
pattern. Most of the cases in this outbreak had bought cheese from street
vendors and, possibly because the outbreak had been identified through
enhanced surveillance and was therefore investigated at an earlier stage,
many had leftover cheese available for examination. _S. typhimurium_ DT
104b was isolated from cheese samples and raw milk. The authors note that
sale of raw milk within the state of California is permitted, but that
dairy farmers are allowed to give or sell milk (raw or pasteurised) only to
people with a license to do so. A statewide campaign was launched to
educate Hispanic consumers about the health risks of unpasteurised cheese.
At the same time, a fivefold increase in salmonellosis was observed among
the Hispanic population in Yakima County in Washington State. A study of 22
patients and 61 controls identified a strong association between illness
and consumption of Mexican-style soft cheese: both DT 104 and DT 104b were
isolated from patients, and over 90% of strains showed the same resistance
pattern (ACSSuT). Unpasteurised milk sampled from tankers that served local
dairies, including the implicated dairy, yielded multiresistant _S.
typhimurium_ DT 104 on two occasions, with a PFGE pattern like that of some
of the cases. Health educators instructed several grandmothers in Yakima
County on safer cheese production, using pasteurised milk and thermometers,
in order for them to teach the community.
