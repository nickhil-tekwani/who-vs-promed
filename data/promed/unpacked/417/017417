Chemoprophylaxis recommendations differ between developing and developed
countries. Chemoprophylaxis is effective in reducing secondary cases in
epidemiologically well-defined and limited situations in developed
countries (e.g. household contacts, day-care contacts, persons with
direct oral contact from kissing, mouth-to-mouth resuscitation).
Generally, for these very limited settings, prophylaxis is given after an
initial case in the US. This does not apply to general medical personnel
(i.e. emergency room personnel) without intimate respiratory contact.
In developing countries with ongoing epidemics, as is currently occurring
in West and Central Africa, chemoprophylaxis a limited role and generally
is not a useful public health intervention. The reason is that carriage
of epidemic strains is common under these circumstances and reinfection
or infection after chemoprophylaxis frequently occurs. Widespread
prophylaxis will only hope to increase drug-resistance rates for a
variety of infections and also increase drug-related toxicity.
For group A and C epidemics in developing countries, rapid mass
vaccination is required to reduce attack rates.
The vaccine has a limited duration of protection but short-term, high
efficacy rates in children and adults (even down to 1 year
of age) can be expected from the polysaccharide vaccine. Threshold
rates are being evaluated to discriminate
epidemic from endemic disease to guide vaccination programs (a rate
greater than 15 cases/100,000/week averaged over a two week period is
the standard). However, in the case where a clear epidemic is ongoing in
a region (as is the case for Chad, Nigeria and Burkina Faso), then
vaccination should be instituted immediately in any near-by
population in which new cases are starting to appear regardless of the
incidence rate.
Is the current West African pandemic known to be due to the group III-1
clonal complex or is it a new clone(s)?

That same CDR Review contains a report of a secondary case of meningococcal
disease occurring in a day nursery contact 16 days after apparently receiving
rifampin prophylaxis, in spite of a survey indicating 55/57 children and 10/10
staff were "thought to have complied fully with treatment." The case is
described as supporting the withdrawal of recommendations to give antibiotics
to nursery contacts of a case, who were felt to be a greater risk of serious
adverse drug reactions than of meningococcal disease. Canadian Guidelines for
Control of Meningococcal Disease (Canada Communicable Disease report Vol 20-3,
15 February 1994) continue to define child care and/or nursery school contacts
as close contacts meriting prophylaxis following a single case. I understand
that the U.S. CDC is currently working on guidelines. I doubt that there is
sufficient data from child care/nursery school cases currently to make a clear
choice between these two recommendations. I have observed that parental and
community anxiety need to be taken into consideration, and that these are
frequently driven by the outcome of the index case.
