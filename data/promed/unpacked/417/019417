FAO has called for broader cattle vaccination to keep lumpy skin disease [LSD] at bay in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, especially in areas where the risk is the highest.

In a position paper published today [25 Sep 2017, see commentary], FAO warned that even countries that have not been affected by LSD so far but are considered at risk need to carry out risk-based vaccination to avert the spread of the disease, which can have devastating consequences for farmers, particularly smallholders.

LSD is a cattle pox virus transmitted by biting insects that can be deadly for cattle but does not affect humans. The disease used to be confined to Africa only [see comment]. In 2013, it emerged in Turkey and then quickly spread through 9 countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

At the height of the disease's spread in Europe, countries hit by LSD registered up to 200 outbreaks, which have led to significant economic losses -- due to drops in milk production and reduced quality of skins -- and the death of up to around 15 percent of the affected herds.

"Although the outbreak in Europe was contained in April [2017] following mass vaccinations, we have seen the disease resurface in recent months in Albania, Greece and Macedonia. It's just another warning sign that the disease has not been fully contained yet and can keep spreading if we don't step up efforts to control it," said Ren Wang, FAO Assistant Director-General, Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department.

FAO urges governments across the regions at risk of lumpy skin disease to carry out vaccination campaigns, especially ahead of bug season, which usually starts in March, when infection rates are highest to prevent, control and eliminate the disease.

Preventive vaccination in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and northern Serbia, for example, would create a buffer zone and stop the disease from potentially spreading to neighbouring countries such as Hungary and Romania, which have been spared to date from the disease.

FAO warned that stamping out -- the proactive culling of all animals on an infected farm -- should be used as a last resort because stamping out can have a drastic impact on farmers' livelihoods, particularly those of smallholders. If stamping out is considered necessary, FAO recommends for this to be used only in the case of clinically affected cattle, when the infection is confirmed by an authorized laboratory, and animals should be humanely culled and appropriately disposed of as soon as possible.

FAO has already played an important role in reshaping countries' policies so that vaccination is used as a key measure to prevent LSD, and to minimize stamping out.

"Despite the progress made in combatting LSD, there are still some grey areas we need to focus on. For one, we need to understand better if LSD can also be transmitted from one animal to another via infected milk, for example, and if infected animals that do not show clinical signs could still spread the virus," said Ren Wang, Assistant Director-General, FAO Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department.

"There is also a need for better regional coordination and heightened surveillance to deal more effectively with the spread of the disease," added Ren Wang.

[As stated above, the current LSD event has been spreading in Eastern Europe and the Balkans since its emergence in Turkey in 2013. It may be assumed that at that time, the disease may have been also circulating in Turkey's southern neighbor, Syria, remaining undiagnosed or unreported due to the political situation.

LSD had been confined to Africa until 1989, though in 1984, some cases were recorded in Oman. In 1988, it penetrated Egypt for the 1st time, and the next year, in 1989, the 1st considerable event in Asia, namely in Egypt's northeastern neighbour Israel, was reported. The focus, one village with 17 dairy cattle holdings in southwest Israel, adjacent to the Gaza strip, was eliminated by stamping out (slaughter of all infected cattle as well as contacts). Ring vaccination with a sheep pox strain was carried out around the focus area, and the disease remained absent (Ref. 1) until its re-introduction in 2006. Scattered reports of LSD were seen in several Gulf states, most probably due to introductions by animals traded with East Africa: Kuwait (1991), UAE (2000), Bahrein (1993 and 2002-2003), and in the Middle East (Israel, 2006-2007, 2012).

FAO's current, useful position paper on LSD (Ref. 2, 16 pages), includes the following articles:
Summary; Transmission; Geographical Distribution; Analysis of incursion risk; Vaccines; Movement Control; Stamping Out; Carcass Disposal; Restocking; Vector Control; Laboratory support; Options for combining vaccination, movement control and stamping out; Areas of uncertainty; references.

The following excerpt has been selected, due to its significance, from the position paper's article "vaccines:"

"Vaccination remains the cornerstone of LSD control in Eurasia and Africa. In Israel, in 2013, vaccination proved effective in controlling LSD with only limited use of stamping out. All of the Balkan countries affected by LSD in 2016 used the Neethling vaccine, either obtained from EU reserves or directly sourced from 2 South African manufacturers. In the Russian Federation and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, modified stamping out was used in vaccinated herds, and only clinical cases were culled, whereas in Albania, stamping out is not applied in vaccinated herds. The EU Commission Implementing Decision 2016/2008 was established to allow preemptive vaccination, but it still requires Member States to cull all animals in an infected herd, even if the herd was vaccinated (Commission Implementing Decision, 2016). Unfortunately, trade penalties for countries vaccinating preemptively act as a disincentive to regional disease control and hence should be evaluated from a cost-benefit perspective. Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/2008 allows the movement of vaccinated animals, under specified conditions, and may reduce some of these drawbacks. It also provides rules for movement of products that are considered to risk transmitting LSD (dairy products, semen, ova and hides). A distinction is made between zones where animals have been vaccinated preventively in the absence of disease (free zones with vaccination) and zones where disease has been reported (infected zones). Milk and dairy products from free zones with vaccination are not restricted. There are exemptions, with specific conditions that should be consulted carefully, for moving consignments of vaccinated animals and risky products from free zones with vaccination and, with greater stringency, from infected zones. In all cases, there is a requirement for at least 28 days to elapse after vaccination."
