FCNA earmarks donation for canine leishmaniasis testing
--------------------------------------------------------
On 27 May 2000, Mrs. John Sprunt Hill, president of the Foxhound Club of
North America, announced that the FCNA had voted to donate $10,000 toward
testing foxhounds for canine leishmaniasis, the protozoan disease that's
forced the cancellation of all but one foxhound show this spring.
The medical authorities have said the chances of transmission at dog shows
are minuscule, but decided to take no chances. Leishmaniasis is not
indigenous to this country. "The disease is not easy to spread without the
vector," he continued. The vector for leishmaniasis is the sand fly
[_Lutzomyia_spp.. While there are species of sand fly in North America,
the disease is not prevalent.
No one yet knows how Millbrook Hunt (N.Y.) foxhounds contracted the
disease. Research has proven that ticks cannot be vectors.
Millbrook has been working closely with medical personnel from Walter Reed
Army Medical Research Center (D.C.), the CDC, and the New York State
Department of Health. Two tests are used for diagnosis. The first is a
blood test for titers in the blood. If a hound scores high, then a PCR test
is done which is a DNA-type test.
Millbrook is the only pack to publicly acknowledge that they have hounds
infected with the disease, although other packs have been infected.
Dogs belonging to servicemen returning from the Middle East have had cases.
Dr. Peter Schantz of the CDC said, "We have blood tests suggesting that the
infection exists in foxhounds in several states. In addition to New York,
positive results have been found in dogs in Virginia, Michigan, Maryland,
North Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee."

[To our knowledge leishmaniasis in dogs infected in these parts of the US
is something new. _Leishmania_ in tropical and subtropical areas of north
and South America is transmitted by _Lutzomyia_ sandflies, and it is
important to initiate studies of which vector is present in the area where
the dogs were infected. If the vector also occasionally feeds on humans,
there is a potential for human infections from the animal reservoir as is
seen in Southern Europe including France, Italy and Spain.
The fact that leishmaniasis in dogs has not been reported previously in the
area suggests a recent introduction. The report mentions that dogs kept by
servicemen returning from the Persian Gulf to the US are a likely source.
The Middle East is a highly endemic area for leishmaniasis, and this seems
a plausible route of introducing the infection to the US, which probably
could be substantiated by molecular typing of the isolated _Leishmania_ to
show whether the _Leishmania_ species isolated were related to the species
commonly found in the Americas or in the Middle East. - Mod.EP
