[With 85 suspected yellow fever (YF) cases during week 45, concern about continuation of an outbreak is real, even though there has been no new case confirmation by the Dakar Institute Pasteur Laboratory since 18 Oct 2018. It is reassuring to learn that the national mass YF vaccination campaign is progressing.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the source URL above.
