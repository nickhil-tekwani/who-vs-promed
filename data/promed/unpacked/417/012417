Tularemia, Ryazan region, Russia
--------------------------------
The town of Klepiki in the Ryazan region had 6 cases of tularemia in June
2005. Natural foci of tularemia exist in 11 districts and in the vicinities
of Ryazan, the Territorial Management of the Russian consumer supervision
of the Ryazan region reported.
As experts of the Russian consumer supervision of the Ryazan region noted,
individuals in the rural area fall ill with tularemia more often. Due to
the development of gardening companies and an increase in the number of
rodents, however, sporadic morbidity among the townspeople has also been
observed. Vaccination of the population is the most effective action for
preventing the disease.

[In 2004, 9 cases more than in 2003 had been reported in the region,
according to <http://www.regions.ru/article/any/id/1743004.html>. The
Ryazan region is located in the center of the European part of Russia, in
subtaiga (the area below the taiga, the subarctic coniferous forests
located south of the tundra in North America, northern Europe, and Asia)
and the forest-steppe zones. Forests occupy about 1/3 of the territories. -

Tularemia is a zoonotic category A bioterrorism agent that can be spread by
aerosolization but is not thought to be transmissible from person to
person. At present, no licensed tularemia vaccine is available in the USA.
However, the LVS vaccine (live vaccine strain) is available to military
personnel under an investigational new drug protocol held by the US Army
Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (1).
The vaccine is administered via scarification using multiple punctures of a
bifurcated needle. LVS is derived from strain 15 developed in the former
USSR and was obtained by the US military in 1956 (2). It is not well
standardized and contains 2 phenotypes of _ Francisella tularensis_, only
one of which seems immunogenic (3). However, in studies published in 1977,
the vaccine was shown to significantly reduce the incidence of typhoidal
tularemia in US government lab workers from 5.7 to 0.27 cases per at-risk
employee years (4). It did not reduce the incidence of the ulceroglandular
form, but the disease in vaccinees was reported to be milder.
