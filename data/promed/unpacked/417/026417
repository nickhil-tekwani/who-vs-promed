At 10:58 p.m. on 25 Mar 2018, the emergency communications center in Charles County received a call for multiple Denny's patrons exhibiting symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning after a gas leak occurred in the restaurant.

The building has been evacuated, and at least 5 people are being checked out by EMS crews for carbon monoxide poisoning. It is reported that the gas leak is coming from the grill area of the restaurant.

Motorists who may be bound for this area should expect delays, as multiple fire and rescue personnel are on the scene tending to the ill and attempting to secure the gas until the gas company can arrive.

[Carbon monoxide is a deadly odorless, colorless gas. Carbon monoxide is most often associated with the fumes from burning fuel in some type of engine, a car, a small engine, a boiler, a gas furnace, or, as in this case, a grill. Carbon monoxide [CO] can build up, particularly indoors, and be the source of a poisoning of multiple people.

In lower doses, a person may experience headaches or dizziness or faint. But in other instances, the high level can overcome a person with little or no warning. Furthermore, those with heart disease or lung disease may be at more risk of collapsing.

Generally, if provided fresh breathing air in a timely manner, the affected individual can recover. However, it doesn't take a long time of breathing high levels of CO to result in death. - Mod.TG
