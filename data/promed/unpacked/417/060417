[A previous occurrence of African swine fever (ASF) started in
December of 2007, included 65 outbreaks in total, and the final
report was issued in June 2009. Outbreaks occurred in wild swine,
commercial swine and back yard pigs. This recurrence, after massive
attempts to shoot wild swine, indicates that continuing problems may
continue to concern Russian animal health authorities. Georgia and
Armenia are the only other non-African country reporting African
swine fever since 2005.
