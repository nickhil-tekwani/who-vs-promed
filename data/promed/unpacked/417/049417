A bit more info - no reaction to a yellow fever vaccination since he didn't
have one.
<trips south of the border. I did, however, receive a tetanus booster in
November of 1997 after cutting myself on a rusty nail.>>

The symptoms seem fairly non-specific; I'll admit to favoring excessive
broad-ranging clinical diagnostics. If insurance would pay or you have
spare resources, a few other infectious disease rule-outs while checking
for heavy metal poisoning could be done, like:
-Giardiasis, other intestinal protozoa (O&P exam); some travel
-Toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, tissue parasites
-Hantavirus from rodent urine or feces; outdoors type, garage clean-up?
-Anisaka/Phoconema nematode gut helminths; from Sushi
-Fungal infections from nitrate-rich soils (e.g. bird/bat fecal
contamination), perhaps _Histoplasma_ (within wbc); _Coccidioides_,
_Pneumocystis_ (lung lavages)...
-Babesiosis or malaria (intraerythrocytic protists; blood smear stain)
-High-titer viruses (CMV, EBV, Herpes virus, parvovirus...)
-Obscure bacteria (_Chlamydia pneumoniae_, _Bartonella hensliae_)

All the physician readers of ProMED-mail will know this, but for the
benefit of others, I wish to comment on the following. "Due to a
transfusion in 1980 he is tested every few years for HIV, etc" ... There
may be other reasons for testing, but not a 1980 transfusion.

[Jim Alexander passed on the following information from Craig Carter &
Norman Ronald, Texas Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory:
Carter & Ronald are working on a computer based diagnostic program for
human infectious diseases (it doesn't address environmental problems like
lead which should still be ruled out). His program's results indicated
listeriosis as the highest probability and the presence of CNS symptoms
indicate an urgency to obtain proper treatment if listeriosis is the
etiologic agent.
Their addresses are: <cncarter@tvmdl.tamu.edu> and <n-ronald@tvmdl.tamu.edu>
[Thanks Craig & Norman. - Mod.MHJ
