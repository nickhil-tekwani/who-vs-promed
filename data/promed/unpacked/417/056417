The anthrax scare reported from the Delhi zoo after the death of a rhinoceros abated on Thursday [10 May 2012] as test reports cleared doubts over anthrax infection as the cause of death. The reports, submitted by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Bareilly and a private lab in Delhi, were negative for anthrax infection, officials said.

The zoo, however, will continue with precautionary measures enforced after the young rhino's death, till there's a final confirmation. "We had sent samples to 3 places. The 3rd report is still awaited. The other 2 reports have come back negative," RA Khan, curator of National Zoological Park, said on Thursday [10 May 2012].

Confirming this, zoo director AK Agnihotri said the final report [has yet] to be submitted by the National Centre for Disease Control [NCDC], formerly the National Institute of Communicable Diseases. "These tests are complicated ones, and we want to be a 100 per cent sure. Until a final confirmation is received, the precautions taken will remain in place," he said.

The 3.5-year-old male one-horned rhinoceros, named Junior Raja, died suddenly on 28 Apr 2012. [Veterinary] doctors who conducted the post-mortem examination recommended that the rhino's blood and food samples be tested for anthrax on the suspicion that the infection may have led to the death. Following the suggestion, samples were sent to IVRI, NCDC, and a private lab in Delhi.

As the tests were in progress, officials had closed entry of visitors to the rhino enclosure. The zoo premises were sanitised by spraying a concentrated disinfectant solution. These arrangements will remain in place for now, officials said.
