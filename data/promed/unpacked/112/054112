Additions to ProMED-mail's postings on Afghanistan livestock deaths
--------------------------------------------------
Further to ProMED-mail posting 20050417.1093, we have contacted colleagues
in Afghanistan. Our main contact is Dr Amir Daad Mohammad, who works for
the USAID-Chemonics/RAMP "Rebuilding Agricultural Market Program in
Afghanistan" as livestock specialist on a project implemented by the Dutch
Committee for Afghanistan. (Dr Daad has worked closely with FAO [Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations] for many years and is a
highly respected colleague). Dr Daad himself visited the north of
Afghanistan between 26 Mar to 6 Apr 2005; he observed many cases of FMD and
heard about PPR [Peste des Petits Ruminants] outbreaks in the territories
of most VFUs [veterinary field units]. He has very recently contacted the
responsible veterinarian in Badakhshan, who provided the following
information, which I paraphrase:
1. The current media-circulated information is inaccurate, probably based
upon a misunderstanding/misreporting, not derived from professional sources
and not certified by any veterinarian or government authorities.
2. There is only one veterinarian (DVM) serving in Badakhshan, and he
himself says there was an outbreak of PPR.
3. The report stated that there was an unknown disease in Badakhshan, but
VFUs in the northern provinces are reporting clinical signs of PPR in sheep
and goats, especially between Nov 2004 and Mar 2005, as well as -- very
recently -- clinical cases of FMD in cattle and sheep.
4. The 6000 deaths referred to in the report are actually a 10 month
cumulative figure of PPR mortality in sheep and goats, derived from the
records of the veterinary department.
5. The veterinary department in Kabul is aware of the outbreaks of PPR and
FMD in the north; subsequently, they have sent a group of veterinarians
along with FMD, PPR, enterotoxamia, and anthrax vaccines for a vaccination
campaign.
6. Nobody has yet collected samples for further investigation.
I would add that other stakeholders are organising an investigation into
the Badakshan area, and the outcome will surely clarify further what is
occurring.
Dr Daad further comments that PPR serosurveillance [ELISA] conducted by the
Afghanistan laboratory up to the end of 2002 (when it was based in
Islamabad, supported by FAO) indicated that PPR was widespread in
Afghanistan, having first been seen about 10 years ago. During 2000,
samples from FMD cases were collected and sent to Pirbright (the FAO World
Reference Laboratory for FMD) where Type Asia-1 virus was confirmed.
Another veterinary colleague, Dr Azizullah Osmani, similarly submitted
samples in 2003, in which Types O and A viruses were identified. At
present, VFUs are reporting FMD and PPR as endemic diseases in Afghanistan.
Although these contagious diseases are undoubtedly present, as Dr Daad and
others have commented, there are almost certainly other factors involved.
Livestock are emerging from an unusually harsh winter with very heavy snow
fall after prolonged drought and are in poor condition, feed is poor and
both internal and external parasites might reasonably be contributing
factors to the observed morbidity and mortality, while other intercurrent
diseases are possibly present.
Dr Daad confirms again that there is no suspicion of rinderpest.
Climatic and husbandry conditions in northern Afghanistan are similar to
those in Badakhshan, and if markedly increased disease incidence or
mortality are not reported from these provinces, it would be of interest to
know why not. Afghan veterinary authorities and NGOs dealing with animal
health could provide useful insight. Additionally, it would be useful to
know more precisely what livestock owners are requesting in the way of
remedies, vaccinations and assistance, if these are being sufficiently
provided by government, NGOs or others, and when the vaccination campaign
mentioned above is to begin.
There is considerable concern about the PPR virus spreading further north
into the Central Asian countries, while there are indications that this may
have already occurred in 2004.
The current information is being sent on behalf of many people within and
outside FAO who have contributed to developing an understanding of what has
been reported from Badakhshan. I would mention my colleagues David Ward,
Giancarlo Ferrari and Juan Lubroth in the FAO Animal Health Service. We are
grateful to Drs Amir Daad Mohammad and Dr Azizullah Osmani for their help.

[The above information, for which Dr Roeder and his colleagues are
gratefully acknowledged, is useful in somewhat reducing the concern, fueled
by the media, about possible emergence of panzootics such as rinderpest.
Their effort is especially commendable in view of the remoteness of the
region and the unstable political situation which seems still to prevail there.
But accurate information will not be available unless on-the-spot
veterinary investigations, supported by sampling and laboratory tests, are
carried out.
No official census of livestock has been carried out in Afghanistan since
1967. FAO's estimated figures for 1996 were 3.7 million cattle, 22 million
sheep and 8.9 million goats, for the entire Afghan territory (249 999 sq mi
or 647 497 sq km); it may be assumed that the numbers have increased since.
There being only one vet in a province spread over 17 011 sq mi (44 059 sq
km -- exceeding the size of Switzerland), with an animal population which
might be counted in 6 or rather 7 figures and animal health situation
which, at its best, is regarded as unsatisfactory, should concern the
international community. The plight of the local population (in Badakhshan,
at least 500 000) is one good reason; the risk of endangering the
neighbouring countries and beyond is another, serious one. This aspect is
underlined by Badhakshan's most distinctive geographic feature, namely the
Vakhan (Wakhan Corridor), a long narrow panhandle that passes between
Tajikistan in the north and Pakistan in the south, linking Afghanistan with
the Xinjiang region in China. - Mod.AS]
