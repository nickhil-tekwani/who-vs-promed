[1] Africa Mercy, charity hospital ship
Date: 8 Sep 2014
From: Thomas Farrell <farrell.thomas@att.net> [edited]


During the hospital ship discussion, there was no mention of Africa Mercy, an NGO modern facility that does medical work in Africa. I'm not sure whether it is readying to go.

[Africa Mercy is the world's largest charity hospital ship. The floating hospital includes 5 state-of-the-art operating rooms as well as intensive care and ward bed space for up to 82 patients https://www.mercyships.org/ships/africa-mercy/?__utma=1.365946213.1410271551.1410271551.1410271551.1&__utmb=1.4.10.1410271551&__utmc=1&__utmx=-&__utmz=1.1410271551.1.1.utmcsr=google|utmccn=(organic)|utmcmd=organic|utmctr=(not%20provided)&__utmv=-&__utmk=167606718. But it is not set up for infectious disease or isolation beds, and there are lots of crew members' children on board (with a school for them). - Mod.JW]

[2] USNS Hospital ships

The USNS Comfort is no longer treated as a 1000-bed unit, as it is too hard to reach the upper racks. All chemical [warfare] cases must be decontaminated before entering the hull. Except for smallpox, most bioweapons are not contagious person to person.

[Tom tells me they are 4-decker bunks. With vomit and excrement coming down from upper bunks and having to sponge down contaminated mattresses, it is impractical. So there are only 250 practical beds. And in the 3 weeks it would take the Comfort to get there, the bed shortage would have long passed 250 (currently almost 200 new cases in just one day according to the WHO). I can see no point in deploying, with its obligatory high upkeep support and security flotilla. - Mod.JW]

[3] Hospital ships for EVD outbreak
Date: 11 Sep 2014
From: Thad Zajdowicz <trzajdowicz@gmail.com> [edited]


Regarding the discussions on ProMED about dispatch of a Navy hospital ship to the EVD outbreak area, as a retired Navy ID physician, and obviously in no official capacity, I doubt their utility, except as sending a message that help is being sent. The ships are configured to treat primarily surgical cases, and there are, so far as I am aware, no isolation facilities aboard. Additionally, ventilation and air handling aboard ship are always interesting issues that don't lend themselves to such reconfiguration.

This said, the military does have assets that would undoubtedly be useful on the ground in the affected countries.

[4] Military medical aid
Date: 9 Sep 2014

Regarding the comment in ProMED-mail posting Ebola virus disease - West Africa (155): hospital ships, military medical ["Finally, a country has asked for military medical aid, and is welcoming it. - Mod.JW"], not everyone believes the military is a welcome addition to this fight, as they cause enormous damage elsewhere and have caused economic deprivation to programs that could have stopped this virus sooner.

If you are going to post comments in favor of the military, you owe equal time to criticisms of the military; otherwise, you are politicizing the list. There seems to be a complete absence of examination as to why the military is the only organization that can respond. The outcome will be:

1) The military will succeed (eventually) in containing EVD (or the virus will run out of infectives and give the appearance of the military succeeding);
2) There will be reinforcement of the belief that only the military can solve problems;
3) The military will get additional funding;
4) Alternatives will not be funded;
5) There will be another crisis somewhere else, and permanent solutions will not be undertaken because "now is not the time" to do so (but it is never the time to do so).

The money should go to the people on the ground and to pay for supplies manufactured at an at-cost price and bring manufacturing equipment to the ground and train the people to make more supplies. We can do this for a fraction of what the military will cost, do it peacefully, and create enormous goodwill. Yes, people will die, and likely more people than with a military operation, but probably not that many more, and down the road, a whole lot fewer people will die from secondary effects (like being bombed). The payoff is what we build long term.

So my point would be that if you want to report the news, do so without offering commentary, or offer links to alternative viewpoints to balance it.

[ProMED does not intend to start a discussion of the pros and cons of military support to the EVD struggle when the immediate need is for aid from whatever quarter is offered and acceptable. We have given time above to adverse criticism. What is needed now is constructive criticism. - Mod.JW]

[5] USA pleads lack of military expertise
Date: 9 Sep 2014

http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/official-us-response-to-ebola-hampered-by-lack-of-expertise-with-deadly-virus/2014/09/09/343e5cd8-385d-11e4-9c9f-ebb47272e40e_story.html


Despite President Obama's call for increased involvement of the U.S. military in the fight against the rapidly escalating EVD epidemic in West Africa, the USA is hamstrung by a lack of military medical personnel with expertise dealing with the deadly virus, a top official in charge of coordinating the U.S. response said on Tue [9 Sep 2014]. "There isn't an existing cadre of people who have experience in treating this epidemic other than the aid group Doctors Without Borders," said Nancy Lindborg of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

The Pentagon announced on Mon [8 Sep 2014] that it would set up a 25-bed field hospital in Liberia to help provide medical care for health workers responding to the epidemic, prompting criticism from international aid groups and global health advocates who said the action was paltry compared with the need in the hardest-hit countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Lindborg said on Tue [9 Sep 2014] that the hospital is intended to provide health care for foreign workers, not Liberians. The goal of the hospital is to "provide assurance that there will be quality health care available for health workers" who have or might volunteer to go to any of the affected countries, she said.

The World Health Organization has said the outbreak is "increasing exponentially" in Liberia. In Montserrado County alone -- where the capital, Monrovia, is located -- there is a need for 1000 treatment beds; only 240 exist.

The Defense Department has provided some equipment, supplies and staff in the region since the outbreak began months ago. But the expectation was that Obama's remarks on Sun [7 Sep 2014] would produce more substantive action and that the U.S. military, with its enormous logistical capacity, extensive air operations, and highly trained medical corps, could address gaps in the response quickly. But the USA does not have a workforce trained in the special protocols for EVD, Lindborg said. WHO is currently training 500 new workers in Liberia, and the U.S. government is supporting that effort, she said.

[This is not an excuse. If WHO can train 500 educationally disadvantaged Africans in a week, it should be possible to train at least 500 US college graduate military medical specialists in that time. - Mod.JW]

[The good news is that military medical and logistical aid has been requested by 2 of the affected countries and will be provided by the USA, UK and China. The bad news is that even if the USNS Comfort with its 250 practicable beds were to sail this week from the USA, during the 3 weeks it would take to reach West Africa, the estimated bed deficit will have far surpassed that. So it seems pointless to send hospital ships, whether military or civilian.

Therefore, large capacity field hospitals will be needed. The USA has announced that its 25-bed field hospital would cost USD 22 million to send to Liberia (including operating costs for how long?), so just imagine the cost of setting up several field hospitals, each with 10 times the capacity.

UIMIL (United Nations Mission in Liberia), as of 30 Jun 2014, had 6020 total uniformed personnel (including 4460 troops, 126 military observers, and 1434 police), 398 international civilian personnel, 860 local staff, and 288 UN Volunteers. It also has vehicles that could help right away with transporting patients, health workers and lab specimens.
