Mosquitoes Found With West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------
Insecticide spraying is planned in the New York City area this week after
health officials found mosquitoes carrying the potentially deadly West Nile
virus in the region for the first time this year.
State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello said the mosquitoes that tested
positive were from Westchester and Suffolk counties, outside the city. But
two birds with the disease have been found in New York City for the first
time this year, the State Health Department said Monday. Birds, like
humans, get the virus from mosquitoes. No human cases have been detected.
Last summer, in the first known appearance of the West Nile virus in the
Western Hemisphere, the disease killed seven people in the metropolitan
area, prompting New York City to undertake a massive campaign of aerial and
ground spraying. In the most serious cases, West Nile virus can cause an
infection resulting in encephalitis. Elderly people or those with weakened
immune systems are most at risk. Suffolk County planned to begin an
insecticide-spraying program Tuesday. Westchester County officials made no
immediate decision about spraying. City officials said hey planned to spray
from trucks late Wednesday night and early Thursday in the sections of
Staten Island where the two infected birds were found.

Increased Research Must be a Priority To Combat West Nile and Other
Vector-Borne Diseases
-------------------------------------------------------------------
"The detection of West Nile virus in _Aedes japonicus_ is worrisome because
this species of mosquito can bite humans and will do so during daylight
hours; this is different than the biting activity of _Culex_ mosquitoes,in
which the virus was found most frequently last year," stated Durland Fish,
Associate Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at
the Yale School of Medicine.
Dr. Fish is the editor-in-chief of a new journal, Vector-Borne and Zoonotic
Diseases, to be published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., (www.liebertpub.com).
The finding of West Nile virus in a new mosquito vector, _ Aedes
japonicus_, demonstrates the adaptability of this exotic virus when it is
introduced into a totally new environment. While local governments have
spent at least $30 million on surveillance; none of this money is used for
research, which is essential in order to ensure the effectiveness of both
surveillance and control, Dr. Fish explained. "To my knowledge the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), have not allocated any funding for research in
the United States on the West Nile virus. Funding for research must be at
least commensurate with funding of surveillance efforts. The finding of
this new [vector species demonstrates the difficulties in understanding,
predicting, and ultimately preventing human risk of West Nile virus
infection. Research is the key to understanding the ecological processes
that control the virus in nature and that research must be
multi-disciplinary,"

New Mosquito-Borne Virus Alert in New York Area
-----------------------------------------------
Faced with more evidence that a potentially lethal, mosquito-borne virus
had survived the winter, health authorities have ordered pesticide spraying
to kill the insects in the New York City area. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
Tuesday urged residents to be calm following the disclosure by health
officials Monday night that the brain-swelling [! West Nile virus - never
detected in the Western Hemisphere until it killed seven people and
sickened 62 others in the region last summer - had been found in mosquitoes
for the first time this year north and east of New York City.
They also said two dead crows infected with the virus had been found in the
city borough of Staten Island and they ordered ground-spraying on
Wednesday. Ground spraying of pesticides began east of New York City in
suburban Suffolk County on Long Island on Monday night and would continue
Tuesday night, officials said. So far this year, no people have been found
to have been infected with the West Nile virus, but months ago health
authorities began a "Fight the Bite" mosquito-awareness campaign in an
effort to keep down the mosquito population by attacking breeding sites.
The virus is spread to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito, which
itself had been infected by having bitten a bird that carried the virus. A
total of 32 mosquitoes and 25 birds with evidence of the virus have been
found in New York City and five suburban counties this year, including one
New Jersey county, officials said. "I think people should be calm about it
just the way people in the city had to last year," Giuliani said at his
daily briefing Tuesday. "They should see it as something that will protect
their health and they should see it as a better early warning system than
we had last year because nobody knew about West Nile Virus then."
The virus can cause potentially lethal brain diseases such as encephalitis
(inflammation of the brain), or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of
the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms of infection can include high fever,
headache and body aches, muscle weakness, loss of consciousness or rash.
U.S. health authorities still do not know how the virus, named after the
region in Uganda where it was first isolated in 1937, was introduced to the
New York region. It could have been from an infected bird that was imported
or an infected human returning from a country in Africa, southwestern Asia
[& Europe ? or the Middle East, where the virus is common.
The New York State Health Commissioner said in a statement that the
discovery of infected mosquitoes in suburban Westchester County north of
New York City was notable because the mosquitoes involved, _ Aedes
japonicus_, fed both day and night, whereas the infected mosquitoes
discovered in the region last year belonged to the species _Culex
pipiens_, which were most active only between dusk and dawn. Health
authorities advised people to try to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes by
wearing shoes and socks and long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outside
for long periods. They also advised applying mosquito repellent.
Aerial spraying and ground spraying of the insecticide malathion in New
York City and its suburbs was controversial last year, with
environmentalists, community activists and many residents challenging the
authorities' claims that it was not harmful to humans. In May, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it would review studies that
suggested malathion has the potential to cause cancer in humans, although
it said the chemical probably was safe.

NY Spraying To Kill West Nile virus
-----------------------------------
Health officials mobilized insecticide-spraying trucks Tuesday after an
encephalitis virus that killed seven people last year turned up again in
mosquitoes and birds across the New York City area. The spraying against
mosquitoes carrying the West Nile virus is being done only from trucks for
the time being. No plans for spraying from planes or helicopters have been
announced. State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello said Monday that the
virus had been found in mosquitoes collected in July in suburban
Westchester and Suffolk counties. Infected birds also have been found in
Westchester, Suffolk and Rockland counties and in New York City's Staten
Island.
Birds, like humans, get the virus from mosquitoes. No cases of the lethal
brain inflammation have been detected in people. But a human infection
"would be the next step we would expect to see," said Barbara Reynolds, a
spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Suffolk
County on Long Island, health officials planned evening spraying Tuesday at
the Fire Island beach resort and in the towns of Lindenhurst and West
Babylon. The county was also distributing free bug repellent. New York
City officials planned to spray late Wednesday night and early Thursday in
sections of Staten Island. Spraying was also scheduled for Thursday evening
in 14 Westchester County communities, including Chappaqua, where the
President and Hillary Clinton have a home.
Elderly people or those with weakened immune systems are most at risk from
encephalitis. Last summer, in the first known appearance of the West Nile
virus in the Western Hemisphere, the disease killed seven people and
infected 62 others in the metropolitan area, prompting New York City to
undertake a huge aerial and ground spraying campaign.

The novelty of West Nile virus in the New York vicinity - a legitimate
question
I have not researched this question, but I am hoping someone can provide an
answer. What is the evidence that West Nile virus is in fact new to this
region? Have comparative serologic studies been done on saved serum? The
Queens area for example, where more of the cases came from, may have a
higher density of mosquitoes; for certain there are a lot more in Queens
than in Manhattan. I find it hard to believe that close to 4-5 % of the
population in the "epicenter" area were infected in a single year. So how
long has it been going on?
As an infectious disease physician in New York City I know that 10-15 cases
of encephalitis over a spring-summer-fall period could have been present
each year without anyone realizing the cause was West Nile virus. Lets face
it, a patient with encephalitis is usually treated empirically with
acyclovir and few if any tests are usually requested (with the exception
of a PCR for herpesvirus), especially in an elderly population. So I'm
sure I am missing the important data that assures us of a new phenomenon.
Otherwise we are in for never ending cycles in this the City and
surrounding States of insecticide sprayings.
[Susceptible birds, especially our migrating species, are unlikely to
visit only sprayed areas, and consequently at least a low level of endemic
West Nile virus [can be expected to persist in this region for the
immediate future. (And what about the past?)

[It is important to reiterate that there have been no human cases of
encephalitis attributable to West Nile virus infection so far this year.
The efficiency of transmission of West Nile virus to birds and humans by
_Aedes japonicus_ is an unknown quantity at present. Dr. Clynes adds a
relevant clinical perspective to the current situation. - Mod.CP
