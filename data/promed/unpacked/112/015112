Indonesia: Chikungunya Spreads to West Timor and Central Sulawesi
-------------------------------------------------
The disease chikungunya, which first emerged in Bandung, West Java, in
December 2003, has spread to East Nusa Tenggara (West Timor) and Central
Sulawesi. Hundreds of people in Kupang, the capital of East Nusa Tenggara,
have been treated at hospitals and public health centers after contracting
the disease, whose symptoms are similar to dengue fever[caused by a
flavivirus], which is transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_.
Chikungunya [caused by an alphavirus], which is transmitted by the mosquito
_Aedes albopictus_, has been spreading across the country during this rainy
season, particularly in regions with high rainfall levels.
Frank Touw, head of the intensive care unit at the Kupang General Hospital,
said on Monday that chikungunya had spread to urban and rural areas in
Kupang regency since last week. "Though the disease is not fatal, those
affected will be physically weak for a fairly long time and it takes 3 to 5
days to recover," he said. Based on The Jakarta Post's monitoring of 5
hospitals and a number of health centers in Kupang, 50 to 100 chikungunya
patients have been admitted daily over the past few weeks.
Experts at Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital in Jakarta are investigating
the outbreak. The disease affected more than 100 people in Yogyakarta, but
its spread was stopped after the local administration launched an
integrated health program, including medical care for sufferers.
In Palu, Central Sulawesi, seven inmates of the city's Maesa Penitentiary
were found to have symptoms of chikungunya when they underwent medical
check-ups at a public health center recently. The head of the Singgani
public health center, Ema Sukmawati, said on Tuesday that the inmates first
showed symptoms of flu, including high fever, and then they experienced
body pains, focused in their legs. Her health center has established a team
to monitor the prison and to [confirm the diagnosis of] chikungunya.
Meanwhile, at least 62 people in 2 districts of Majalengka regency, West
Java, are suffering from chikungunya. In Jatiwangi district, 43 people are
being treated for the disease and 19 others are being treated in
Sumberjaya. Most of the patients are in the recuperation phase of the
disease, according to the Majalengka health office. Asep Suandi, head of
the health office, told the Post in Majalengka on Tuesday that the actual
number of cases might be higher because many people in the regency's other
districts had not reported to the health office after contracting the
illness. Earlier, chikungunya hit 3 villages in Klangenan district, Cirebon
regency, with no less than 94 people being admitted to health clinics in
the past one and a half months. Jarmadi Kusmayadi, head of the Cirebon
health office's disease monitoring section, said neither the provincial nor
the central governments had taken action to stop the spread of the disease
in the region.

[This report indicates that chikungunya, since its appearance in West Java
in December 2002, is rapidly spreading eastwards throughout the Indonesian
archipelago. Chikungunya is considered to be a relatively recent
introduction into Southeast Asia, and an increasing public health problem.
ProMED-mail is indebted to a correspondent, Richard W. Wilsnack, Ph.D.
<wilsnac@medicine.nodak.edu>, for compiling a list of recent publications
describing progress in the rapid diagnosis and characterization of the
disease. Those interested should communicate directly with Dr. Wilsnack.
Perhaps of most general interest are the results of a successful phase II
and immunogenicity trial of a live attenuated vaccine (Edelman R et al.,
"Phase II safety and immunogenicity study of live chikungunya virus vaccine
TSI-GSD-218," American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 62: 6, June
2000, 681-685), and completion of the sequencing of the genome of an
African isolate of Chikungunya virus (Khan AK et al., "Complete nucleotide
sequence of chikungunya virus and evidence for an internal polyadenylation
site," Journal of General Virology, 83: Pt 12, December 2002, pp.
3075-3084). The later paper confirms that Chikungunya virus and
O'nyong-nyong virus, another member of the genus _Alphavirus_ of similar
disease-producing potential but as yet still restricted to the African
continent, are related but clearly distinct viruses (and ranked accordingly
as distinct virus species by the ICTV). - Mod.CP]
