The Mexican government on Tuesday [4 Aug 2009] urged its citizens to combat
dengue fever, a mosquitoborne tropical virus infection that causes muscle
pain, internal bleeding, and death. Mexican health minister Jose Angel
Cordoba Villalobos urged the public to avoid standing water in abandoned
cars and garbage, which attracts mosquitoes, and to keep houses clean. He
also asked Mexicans to report to the health authorities immediately if they
show any symptoms of dengue.

The disease is threatening the lives of thousands of Mexicans. Some 8895
cases of dengue had been confirmed by Sunday [2 Aug 2009], compared with a
total of 10 400 cases registered last year [2008], Cordoba Villalobos told
local radio.

Many state authorities have issued virus alerts to local residents,
including Colima, Guanajuato, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Puebla, San Luis Potosi,
and the state of Mexico. Sanitary barriers were set up in Gorda mountain
range in Queretaro state. Residents of several other states have launched
yard and roof cleaning campaigns to combat the disease.

The Heath Ministry warned of another possible outbreak of dengue in 2
months, with the start of north eastern monsoon, thus, urging the public to
remain alert. Health Ministry spokesman WMD Wanninayake speaking to The
Nation yesterday [8 Aug 2009] said the number of dengue cases being
reported has declined recently.

"This reduction is due to the warm, dry weather and the successful dengue
prevention campaigns. However, deaths caused by dengue are still being
reported, but not in noticeably large numbers," he added. "According to the
latest reports from the Epidemiology Unit, a total of 227 deaths have
occurred due to dengue, out of which, the highest number (41) is reported
from Gampaha. The total number of cases reported so far is 21 745.

[Although 3 dengue cases hardly constitute a significant outbreak, both
dengue and many chikungunya cases have been reported from Gujarat state
since March 2009, and the 3 cases indicate that dengue virus continues to
be transmitted there.
