The outbreak of whooping cough in East Sepik province is stretching the
limited resources of a medical team sent to the affected areas, and there
are fears that the situation is on the verge of getting out of control.
According to the latest reports, the situation is worsening by the day, as
it sweeps through the Sepik plains into Angoram district.
The National reported last Wed 7 Jun 2006 that 16 children have already
died, and the toll is expected to rise further. Four new cases had been
detected at Pagwi station, while the medical team sent to help has just
about exhausted every available resource to prevent further spread, and the
death toll rising.
The work load on the whooping cough team has now been compounded, the
helicopter hired to ferry health workers and drugs into inaccessible areas
of central Sepik having been pulled back by the management of Niugini
Helicopters until payments are made.
An emergency provincial health task force meeting was held in Wewak to
decide the best methods of tackling the cough epidemic. They resolved to
immunize every child in the Sepik plains against the disease.
Health Minister Sir Peter Barter has ordered the Health Department to send
a team to investigate the situation. "The provincial team has been in the
area for the past few weeks immunizing children and are attempting to curb
the spread of the disease." Sir Peter said the situation seemed under
control, although "we are anxious to ensure it does not spread."
A health extension officer in East Sepik said they had immunization
programs in place, but "how can one access long stretches of savannah
grassland with tons of vaccines, especially on foot."

[Whooping cough (pertussis) causes a classical paroxysmal coughing period
during a single expiration preceding a "whoop" (a massive inspiration, with
air forced against a partially narrowing glottis), especially suggestive in
an un-immunized population. Most deaths seem to occur in young (especially
less than one year of age) unvaccinated children.
ProMED thanks Dr. Goto for pointing us to this pertussis outbreak. A map of
Papua New Guinea showing the location of East Sepik province can be found at
