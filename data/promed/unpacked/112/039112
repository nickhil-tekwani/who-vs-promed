The 27-year-old woman who died in the Katutura State Hospital on 24
Sep 2011 had liver failure and not a communicable disease. Similarly,
the 41-year-old man who died in the Roman Catholic Hospital on 27 Sep
2011 had no contagious disease and died of heart failure.

This was confirmed at a meeting at the Ministry of Health and Social
Services head office in Windhoek yesterday [3 Oct 2011]. The ministry,
the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention launched an investigation last week [week of 26
Sep 2011] after it was reported that people were allegedly dying of a
mysterious bleeding disease in the Hakahana area of Katutura.

Yesterday [3 Oct 2011], it was also revealed that only 2 patients died
and not 4 as had been reported earlier. It was further established
that the 2 deaths were unrelated. When the female patient was admitted
to hospital, she complained of headache and a body rash. She was also
found to be bleeding. After admission, her condition deteriorated and
she later died.

The 2nd patient collapsed on arrival at hospital and later died.
According to his death certificate, he died because of heart failure.

Dr Jack Vries of the health ministry said the probe showed that there
is no public health concern. On Friday [30 Sep 2011] already, Vries
had said the patients did not die of poisoning. This came after he
ruled out haemorrhagic fever -- like Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever,
Ebola fever, or Rift Valley fever -- as the cause of the deaths on
Thursday [29 Sep 2011].

Reports of a 'mysterious disease' causing the deaths of several people
in Windhoek's Hakahana residential area were yesterday [3 Oct 2011]
nipped in the bud. A local daily last week [week of 26 Sep 2011]
reported that 4 people died from a mysterious illness that caused a
strange rash and haemorrhaging through the nose, eyes, and other
openings of their bodies.

"There is no reason for any panic," announced Dr Jack Vries, the
chairperson of the National Health Emergency Management Committee,
after investigations showed that there were only 2 cases, instead of
the reported 4, and that the causes of deaths were completely
natural.

The Ministry of Health and Social Services, along with the World
Health Organisation and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, launched an investigation. A 27-year-old woman died of
liver failure, and a 41-year-old man died of heart failure. Vries
labeled the media reports as very irresponsible "and this is also
coming from the minister's mouth".

Neither the reporting journalist nor the family of the alleged victims
could indicate who the other 2 people were, or the hospital or
mortuary where the other 2 cases came from. "How can you write a front
page story stating 'mysterious disease kills 4 people', causing panic
and scaring people in that way? This is sensationalism and poor
reporting."

In both cases the investigation revealed that the causes of death were
not likely due to communicable disease of public health concern. The
deceased did not even have contact with or links to each other. "These
cases do not represent a presentation of a contagious disease as
speculated in the media," said Vries. He also stressed that in both
cases the family members are also fine and there are no complaints of
anyone being ill. "It is nothing infectious and is not spreading."

According to the investigation team rumors will not always be accurate
and therefore should be investigated to determine if it is of public
health concern. The woman was admitted to the Katatura Hospital on 24
Sep 2011 after she was found unresponsive by her family. Earlier that
day she also visited the hospital complaining about headache and a
body rash. After the clinic visit she stayed home from work until her
family found her and brought her to the hospital. She was bleeding
from the nose and mouth, while her health quickly deteriorated. The
investigation revealed that the cause of death was liver failure.

The man died of heart failure. He was admitted to the Roman Catholic
Hospital on 27 Sep 2011 after complaining that he was suffocating. The
family indicated that they saw mucous secretions from his mouth but no
sign of red blood in secretions or eyes. There were also no reports of
fever as is the case with viral infections. The patient died of
cardiac arrest while a further review by the investigation team
indicates a possible acute respiratory event such as pulmonary
embolism leading to cardiac arrest.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ronan Kelly for forwarding these 2 reports which
clarify the situation in Namibia. Clearly there has been no outbreak
of a transmissible haemorrhagic fever in Namibia, nor any other
communicable disease in Windhoek associated with these 2 cases.
