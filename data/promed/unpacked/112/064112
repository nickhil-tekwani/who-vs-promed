Re: ProMED Leptospirosis - Australia (02): (QL) 20210514.8360994
----------------------------------------------------------------
The 2 pictures in The Queensland Times of [13 May 2021], accompanying the article by Phoebe Looms, show only dead, respectively caged rats, and not mice, as the 2 legends incorrectly mention. The wild brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) and the black rat (_R. rattus_) are murid rodent species, distinctively different from all "mice" species, and can be the reservoir of up to 10 different zoonotic pathogens, particularly the now dominant wild brown rat. For example, the latter can excrete in its urine 2 bacteria, _Leptospira_ and _Bartonella_, but also 2 RNA viruses, _Seoul orthohantavirus_, and rat hepatitis E virus (HEV). The rat plague in Queensland was thus presumed to be linked exclusively to an outbreak of leptospirosis, with a reported 78 cases to date this year [2021], compared with only 41 cases at the same time last year [2020].

While leptospirosis is and remains indeed the most important zoonosis worldwide, particularly in (sub)tropical regions, orthohantavirus infection is however another rodent-borne global contender [1], being moreover the great imitator of leptospirosis in all clinical and laboratory aspects [1,2], except perhaps for a distinctive (but often missed), massive and often nephrotic-range proteinuria, with a self-limiting "flash-like" duration of 2-3 weeks after infection [3]. Moreover, since the rat is the same reservoir for both zoonotic pathogens, concomitant leptospiral & hantaviral infection can occur in the same patient [4], so that even in sero-confirmed leptospiral cases, screening for hantaviral coinfection remains mandatory since early treatment with antibiotics is only indicated for the former bacterial infection. In fact, the earliest reports of sero-confirmed and clinically documented human hantaviral infection in the New World and in the Indian subcontinent resulted, respectively, from such hantaviral screening in patients, originally suspected for leptospirosis in Recife, Brazil (1993), and in Chennai and Cochin, both in South-India (2006)[5,6]. Consequently, urban or localized outbreaks of sero-confirmed leptospirosis require best a "second screening" in our opinion to exclude or confirm orthohantavirus infections [7].

Hantavirus infection in humans is classically presented as resulting in two main clinical syndromes: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), caused by Old World and New World orthohantaviruses, respectively, although a considerable overlap often exists, which is still growing [1,2]. Like for leptospirosis, the clinical presentation of both syndromes can vary from subclinical, mild, to moderate and severe, depending not only on the causative viral agent itself but also on the human auto-immune response, consisting of a pro-inflammatory "cytokine storm". In this aspect, both zoonoses, like some other emerging zoonoses, including COVID-19, can present surprisingly similar symptoms, sometimes consisting of multiple organ disease (MOD), often with the lung and kidney as main target organs. Although many new hantaviruses were recently characterized in insectivores (bats, moles, and shrews) worldwide, only some rodent-borne hantavirus species have a proven pathogenic potential so far for humans, thus resulting in HFRS, HCPS, or increasingly mixed forms [1,8]. The most important hantaviral pathogens are _Hantaan orthohantavirus_ (HTNV) in the Far East, _Puumala orthohantavirus_ (PUUV) in Russia and Europe, _Dobrava orthohantavirus_ (DOBV) in Central-Europe, Russia, and the Balkans, and _Sin Nombre orthohantavirus_ (SNV) or _Andes orthohantavirus_ (ANDV), respectively, in North- and South-America. All these hantaviral pathogens have thus a well-defined geographical spread, due to the restricted biotope of their respective rodent reservoirs. The only noticeable exception however is _Seoul orthohantavirus_ (SEOV), carried and spread worldwide by wild rats [1,8,9], formerly likewise by SEOV-infected laboratory rats [10], and more recently also by infected pet and breeder rats [11]. Nevertheless, the extreme paucity of SEOV-HFRS cases reported in the West, Africa, and Australia contrasts starkly with the long-standing recognition of SEOV-HFRS cases in the Far East, particularly in China, even since the early 1980s [8]. The prevalence of SEOV-infected rats is similar in many parts of Asia to that found in Europe, the Americas, and Africa, and appears to have been fundamentally unchanged over decades.

After a 1986 World Health Organization (WHO)-sponsored screening study on 5 continents (including Australia) [12], it became clear that HFRS in non-endemic areas were often rat-induced, retrospectively meaning they were in fact mostly isolated SEOV-HFRS cases, being often milder, and with "atypical" symptoms involving the liver much more than the kidney, leading to missed or incorrect ("viral hepatitis") clinical diagnoses, instead of HFRS with, or even without, acute kidney injury (AKI)[8]. For this pioneer WHO screening with immunofluorescence assay (IFA), prototype murine HTNV-76-118 was still used, because of its high degree of cross-reacting with equally murine SEOV, hence the frequent finding of what was then prudently called "HTNV-like" infections [12]. All the screened countries had, and still have, the wild rat as the most important, if not unique, reservoir for pathogenic hantaviruses, particularly in urban surroundings. Indeed, as the ProMED moderator ML remarked correctly, inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for infestation by this commensal rodent par excellence.

Using this HTNV-IFA screening in Australia, high antibody prevalence rates were found in wild brown rats captured between 1981 and 1983, with 2/16 (13%) positive in Northern Territory, 2/12 (17%) in South Australia, 3/8 (38%) in Victoria, and 8/19 (42%) in Queensland, suggestive for a local presence of a known rodent SEOV reservoir [12]. Here again, as for the current 2021 rodent-borne outbreak, the clearly higher results for Queensland are noticeable. Until 2005 however, and despite these 1984 WHO findings, no typical HFRS cases had been reported from this continent, raising questions by P. Bi et al. why humans did not seem infected by hantaviruses in Australia, from the early 1980s through 2005 [13].

Conclusion
With increasingly sophisticated technology and enhanced clinical awareness, many specific hantaviruses are now recognized; however, SEOV remains the globally most widely distributed hantavirus, but paradoxically also the most underdiagnosed orthohantavirus infection. SEOV is maintained in nature among chronically infected brown rats, that are found in virtually every corner of the world, living in close association with humans, yet the incidence of SEOV-HFRS varies widely between Far-east Asia, where its pathogenic potential is well recognized, and the remainder of the world, where very few human cases have been documented, and none so far in Australia, nor in New Zealand. SEOV infections should be considered in patients presenting with a sudden febrile flu-like illness with myalgias and gastrointestinal complaints, associated with transient thrombocytopenia and (often massive, but equally rapidly transient) proteinuria, accompanied by self-resolving hepatitis, especially if a history of possible exposure to brown rats is elicited [1,2].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Jan Clement for his comments. Dr Clement makes the important point, as he has previously, that _Seoul hantavirus_, or SEOV, infection may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis, since serious, potentially life-threatening complications of leptospirosis that include renal failure, liver disease, and pneumonia can mimic the clinical manifestations of SEOV infection. The potential for misdiagnosis will not be resolved until routine laboratory tests are done to differentiate between them. Dr Clement also reminds us that more than one pathogen may be responsible for the disease outbreak that occurred since brown rats are the reservoir for both SEOV and _Leptospira_. - Mod.ML
