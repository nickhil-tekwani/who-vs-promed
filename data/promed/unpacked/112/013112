Croatia's prime minister on Tuesday accepted the health minister's
resignation over the deaths of 23 dialysis patients, but said products
made by a US company were most likely to blame. Government officials
blamed filters or dialyzers produced by Baxter International Inc., of
Chicago, for the deaths.
In accusing the US firm, Croatian officials said that all 23 patients
who died were treated with the Baxter-made filters and that others
survived when their filters were replaced with other brands.
Health experts participating in the investigation said last week that
a suspicious "substance" was found on Baxter filters, but that it
could not be immediately identified. Dialyzers filter waste from the
blood before it is returned to kidney patients.
While calling the accusations premature, Baxter last week issued a
worldwide recall of the type of filters used in Croatia.
The same type was used in Spain, where 10 kidney patients died over a
relatively short period last summer and in Texas, where 2 kidney
patients died 16 Oct 2001 and 2 were hospitalized with complications.
The US Food and Drug Administration has also opened an investigation
into the deaths,
along with Spanish authorities.
Baxter expressed willingness to cooperate and has established an
independent panel of experts to look at the cases.

[In addition to the previously reported deaths in Croatia and Spain,
this article mentions 2 deaths and 2 additional illnesses that
occurred in dialysis patients in Texas. Rather than rely upon press
releases, we would very much appreciate information from official
sources on the "suspicious substance" found on the filters. - Mod.MPP
