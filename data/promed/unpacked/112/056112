The Collier Mosquito Control District found 2 mosquito species in their traps that are new to Collier County. Scientists collected the invasive _Aedes scapularis_ and _Aedes tortilis_. This increases the number of known mosquito species in Collier County to 48.

The _Aedes scapularis_ is a potential threat because it is capable of transmitting yellow fever and Venezuelan equine encephalitis [viruses].

The district will continue to closely monitor their collection of mosquitos each week and will be keeping an eye out for this species.

They are encouraging everyone to be proactive by wearing repellant and pouring out standing water.

[The discovery of _Aedes scapularis_ in Collier County, Florida, is not a surprise. An 18 Dec 2020 report in Entomolgy Today stated that _Aedes scapularis_ "has a wide range, from Texas to parts of South America and throughout much of the Caribbean. In 1945, 3 specimens of larval _Ae. scapularis_ were found in Monroe County, Florida, in the Middle Florida Keys, but _Ae. scapularis_ has not been seen in Florida since then, until now.

"A new study published in November [2020] in the Journal of Medical Entomology by Lawrence Reeves, Ph.D., of the University of Florida and colleagues from UF, the Broward Mosquito Control Section, and the Miami-Dade Mosquito Control Division reports that _Ae. scapularis_ is now established in mainland Florida in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. This has potential significance for public health in the region."

Although new to Collier County, _Aedes tortilis_ is native to southern Florida and not known to carry viruses, so the discovery of _Aedes scapularis_ is of more significant public health importance. - Mod.TY
