The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is launching an emergency mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever from 20 Jun 2013, following laboratory confirmation of 6 cases in the country on 6 Jun 2013.

The mass vaccination campaign aims to cover at least 503 426 people in the 3 affected health zones of Lubao, Kamana and Ludimbi-Lukula [Kasai-Oriental province], where cases have been confirmed.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the 6 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported from 3 health zones: Lubao (4 cases), Kamana (1 case) and Ludimbi-Lukula (1 case). They were identified through the national surveillance program for yellow fever. The laboratory confirmation was done by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever.

Preliminary outbreak investigation revealed that the index case is a 16-year-old boy from Kisengua village in the Lubao Health Zone who became ill on 1 Mar 2013. The outbreak investigation team has also identified 51 suspected cases including 19 deaths, in the 3 health zones. Serum samples have been taken from 13 patients and are being analyzed in the Institute National of Biomedical Research (INRB).

According to the CDC, yellow fever virus is found in tropical and subtropical areas in South America and Africa. The virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito.

Illness ranges in severity from a self-limited febrile illness to severe liver disease with bleeding. Yellow fever disease is diagnosed based on symptoms, physical findings, laboratory testing, and travel history, including the possibility of exposure to infected mosquitoes.

There is no specific treatment for yellow fever; care is based on symptoms. Steps to prevent yellow fever virus infection include using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and getting vaccinated.

[The 6 cases are the same ones reported in the 14 Jun 2013 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20130616.1775298). The new information in the above report is that these cases have been laboratory confirmed as yellow fever (YF) by the WHO reference laboratory, the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal. Another important piece of new information in the above report is the occurrence of the 51 suspected cases including 19 deaths, indicating that the outbreak is likely to be much more extensive than originally reported if these cases are indeed YF ones. That makes the initiation of the vaccination campaign urgent.
