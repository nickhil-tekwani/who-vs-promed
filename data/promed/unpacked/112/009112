Authorities quarantined 2 cattle herds after detecting anthrax
--------------------------------------------------
Veterinarians said the discovery was expected, because recent heavy rains
were likely to stir up dormant anthrax spores. Beth Carlson, a North Dakota
deputy state veterinarian, said Wednesday the herds were located in the
Sheyenne River valley in Ransom County, in southeastern North Dakota. Their
owners and precise locations were not disclosed.
The suspected cases were confirmed at a North Dakota State University
veterinary lab, Carlson said. "Anthrax is reported almost every year in
North Dakota," she said. "With the amount of rainfall we have received,
this is certainly not surprising news."

[Anthrax has an infrequent but regular appearance in eastern North Dakota
along the border with Minnesota. Its frequency in this region is probably
inversely proportional to the annual vaccine usage by the potentially
affected ranchers, i.e., in relation to the perceived threat. Get a few
years without cases and animals don't get vaccinated. Unfortunately
awareness falls off as well, and outbreaks then become bigger than they
need to be. Further details have been requested from the veterinary
authorities in the state. - Mod.MHJ]
