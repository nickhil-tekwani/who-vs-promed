Grain affected by pink mould had a fungus called fusarium head blight
[FHB], the Department of Agriculture and Food [DAF] said yesterday
[12 Jan 2009]. Grain handler CBH said that though the fungus had been
found in some samples of pink-stained wheat and barley, toxins
produced by the fungus had not. It said that pink-stained grain would
be handled separately and would remain classified as low-grade
feedstock, a move by CBH in response to the 1st round of government
laboratory testing which seemed to indicate the grain did not have
FHB. It said Agriculture Department tests were continuing.

The Agriculture Department, which has set up a help website, said the
problem with pink mould had arisen because of the exceptionally wet
end to the growing season. Farmers have reported feeding pink-stained
grain to their livestock without ill effects, raising hopes that
toxicology tests will prove negative.

Tests of samples to date have shown a number of causes of pink
staining in grain. These include individual samples, which contain
yeast, physiological damage, and fusarium. These results are not
unexpected due to the unusual seasonal conditions that have occurred.

Fusarium head blight [FHB] been detected on the grain samples.
Further tests have now confirmed the fungi associated with fusarium
head blight. _Fusarium avenaceum_, _Fusarium acuminatum_, _Fusarium
compactum_ and _Fusarium crookwellense_ have been detected in 3
barley samples and one wheat sample. No _Fusarium graminearum_, most
commonly associated with FHB toxins, has been found to date.

FHB is not common in cereal crops in Western Australia. It was
previously detected on the south coast in 2004 in wheat and barley
grain and summer crop residues. The department will continue to test
grain samples provided by CBH for _Fusarium_ species to monitor the
situation and determine how the grain can best be marketed.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB) of small-grain crops can be caused by
several related fungal pathogens. These were originally placed in the
genus _Fusarium_, but some species have since been re-classified
including the above _F. graminearum_, _F. acuminatum_ and _F.
avenaceum_ (all now genus _Gibberella_).

FHB is favoured by humid conditions during flowering and early stages
of kernel development. It results in yield losses, reduces the grade
of harvested grain and, if toxins are produced, these can affect
stock. Disease management includes fungicides and crop varieties with
reduced susceptibility. For more information on FHB please see
previous ProMED-mail post no. 20080708.2073 and links below.

Initially, FHB was ruled out as the problem in WA. In the recent
tests, besides the yeasts and FHB pathogens mentioned above, bacteria
(_Pseudomonas_ and _Xanthomonas_ species; DAFWA personal
communication) have also been detected in some of the pink-stained grain.
