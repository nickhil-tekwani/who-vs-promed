Report date: 9 May 2018
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: O
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (4)
Outbreak 1: Kiambu, Kiambu
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Aug 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 274 / 18 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak 2: Kabitet, Nandi
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Jan 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 60 / 14 / 0 / 0 / 0

Outbreak cluster 3: Kathonzweni, Makueni (2 outbreaks)
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jan 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 8 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 4
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 342 / 24 / 0 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 7.02 / 00 / 00 / 00
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: illegal movement of animals, contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering, fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.), airborne spread
Epidemiological comments: although the disease has been historically present in the country, a new variant of serotype O was detected: topotype EA2. Further vaccine matching studies by virus neutralization test revealed this finding.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone quarantine; screening; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); disinfecting; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Foot and Mouth Disease Laboratory, Embakasi (local laboratory) / Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 26 Jan 2018 /Positive
Foot and Mouth Disease Laboratory, Embakasi (local laboratory) / Cattle / real-time PCR / 26 Jan 2018 /Positive
The Pirbright Institute (OIE reference laboratory) / Cattle / virus sequencing / 26 Jan 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The following information on Kenya can be found in the January-March, 2018 European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) monthly report "Global Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation."

January monthly report; see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/Jan_GMR_2018.pdf:
"The FMD National Reference Laboratory, Embakasi, Kenya detected during January 2018 FMDV serotypes A (1 sample), O (17 samples), and SAT 1 (1 sample) and FMDV genome (3 samples) in the 23 bovine samples tested. O/EA-2 (3 samples) and SAT 1/I/unnamed (1 sample) were detected among the seven bovine samples collected between November 2016-2017 that were submitted to the WRLFMD for genotyping. Most closely related virus not pertaining to the country for O/EA-2 is represented by UGA/3/2004 with a seq id of at least 91.5 percent, while for SAT 1/I/unnamed, the field virus not pertaining to the country is represented by T155/71 isolated in Tanzania with a seq id [sequence identity] of 89.8 percent."

February monthly report; see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/February2018.pdf:
"As for the previous country, the FMD National Reference Laboratory, Embakasi, Kenya detected during February 2018, FMDV serotypes O in seven samples and SAT 1 in one sample out of the 18 cattle samples tested. The field viruses O/KEN 4 and 6/2017 that were genotyped as O/EA-2 obtained good matching results in the VMSD [vaccine matching strain differentiation] tests conducted with vaccine strains O 3039, O Manisa, and O TUR5/09".

March monthly report; see http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd_new/docs/March_GMR_2018.pdf:
"During the reporting month, the FMD National Reference Laboratory, Embakasi, Kenya detected FMDV serotype O using antigen ELISA in the cattle samples collected from 2 outbreaks that occurred at Kericho and at Narok. Although, clinical cases were observed on the respective farms, with the 1st farm reporting 2 affected animals of the 8 present and the 2nd farm, 7 affected animals of the 30 present, deaths were not registered. The location of the 2 outbreaks from which the samples were collected are represented in Map 15. The laboratory staff was involved in the field in the investigation of FMD outbreaks in Narok in collaboration with the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) with whom it has on-going collaborations, and in providing advice to the local community for the containment of FMD. The Reference Laboratory was also involved in the training of field staff on good sampling procedures for FMDV and in studies of FMD circulating viruses". - Mod.CRD
