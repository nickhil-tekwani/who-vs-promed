According to the Councilor for Agriculture of the Piedmont Region, Marco Protopapa, there is an increase in cases of African swine fever [ASF] in Liguria, particularly in the area around the A7 motorway, so checks will be concentrated in the areas close to this artery. He also mentioned 2 other cases discovered in the Ligurian territory for which the results of the analysis are awaited.

These days the commissioner is participating in numerous technical discussions on the disease which so far, in Piedmont alone, has killed 7 wild boars. The region, together with the prefecture, is organizing a monitoring service in the municipalities around the A7 to identify any other wild boar carcasses and submit them for analysis. The checks, which will not be the only ones in the area, will be carried out by the hunters at the head of the teams indicated by the ATC [Territorial Management Area] together with the provincial hunting guards and the forest police.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for his submission.

The introduction of ASF to Northern Italy presents a long leap of the ASF genotype 2 virus from affected countries. A possible route of introduction is by infected animal products introduced by travellers along the A7 motorway and consumed by wild boar. The closest infected territories, at present, are eastern Germany and Poland, but the source could be any infected country. A map of the world displaying the presence of ASF as of 7 Dec 2022 by administrative divisions is available in OIE's "ASF situation report 3" published 12 Jan 2022 (https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2022/01/asf-situation-report-3.pdf).

The said situation report includes the following summary of the updated global situation (abridged):

"The epidemiological situation of ASF continued to deteriorate in 2020-2022. Since January 2020, 6 countries have reported ASF as a 1st occurrence in the country, while 12 countries reported its spread to new zones.

"As observed in Europe and in some regions of Asia, the transmission of ASF seems to depend largely on the wild boar population density and their interaction with low-biosecurity pig production systems. The good knowledge and management of the wild boar population and good coordination among the Veterinary Services, wildlife and forestry authorities are required to successfully prevent and control ASF."

The ASF (genotype 2) panzootic started in 2007, initially in the Caucasus region of Georgia. From there, the virus gradually spread to neighboring countries, eventually penetrating the European Union in 2014, affecting wild boars and domestic pig farms. Two countries in Europe have managed to eradicate the disease: Belgium (event resolved in March 2020) and Czech Republic (event resolved in April 2018).

ASF serotype 1 arrived in the south of Sardinia in 1978, probably due to administration of introduced contaminated swill from southwest Africa. ASF virus genotype 1 was the last remnant of a large epidemical wave that affected Europe and America from the '50s to '90s. This virus is still circulating in an endemic area in the central-east part of the island and is not related to the new introduction in Italy's mainland.

The event is of grave concern to Italy's intensive pork industry as well as to neighbouring countries, in particular the threat posed by the wild boar population which does not recognize borders. - Mod.AS
