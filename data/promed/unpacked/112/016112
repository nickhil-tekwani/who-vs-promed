Out of 57 individuals, 13 have tested positive for Japanese encephalitis (JE) in [Nagaland] State, with reports of 2 dying till date due to the vector-borne disease.

Stating this, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) programme officer and Health & Family Welfare deputy director, Dr Neisakho Kere told Nagaland Post over telephone on [Wed 7 Aug 2019] that out of the 13 positive JE cases, 4 hailed from Assam and 9 from Nagaland, mainly from Dimapur and Mokokchung.

And out of the 2 deaths reported so far, one was from Dimapur and another from Mokokchung, while the rest had been discharged after treatment, he added.

Dr Kere claimed that the Health department had been able to contain the disease till date with various preventive measures. In this regard, he explained that as soon as a JE positive case was reported, health workers were sent to find out the history of where the person got infection and check whether the person had gone out of the State. Entomological teams were also being sent out for vector study and detect presence of _Culex_ mosquitoes, after which fogging was carried out in high risks areas, he added.

He said workers were also sent to control larvae cycle of mosquitoes mostly present in stagnant water.

Referring to introduction of larvivorous fish in paddy fields and other stagnant bodies to eat mosquito larvae, the deputy director said larvivorous fish was available under Urban Malaria Scheme at Dimapur chief medical officer's office and was distributed every month.

He claimed that many other preventive measures were being carried out to curb the disease.

Emphasising on the importance of community participation and cooperation that were vital to reduce source reduction, the deputy director appealed to the community to extend support as the department alone could not control JE, dengue or any other vector borne disease in Dimapur district. He explained that source reduction could be achieved by keeping the surroundings clean, removing objects that could collect stagnant water around homes and using mosquito repellents during the day and sleeping under LLIN [mosquito net impregnated with insecticide] bed nets at night.

[The number of JE cases continues to grow in Nagaland. On 19 Jul 2019 officials reported 30 suspected and 9 positive JE cases. The numbers are now 57 suspected cases and 13 positives, with 2 deaths. As noted in the previous post, it is not surprising that JE cases are occurring in Nagaland. It is adjacent to Assam state, where a JE outbreak with additional cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) are occurring. In these Nagaland reports, however, no AES cases are mentioned. Since this is still the JE virus transmission season it is likely that there will be more cases over the next 2 months. Although JE vaccine is available, neither this or previous reports say if there have been recent JE vaccination campaigns in the affected areas, or if any are planned. - Mod.TY

After having claimed 142 lives in Assam this year [2019], cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) are finally on the decline. According to the latest figures available with the National Health Mission (NHM), Assam, no fresh JE deaths and positive cases have been reported in the last 2 days

Though official said that the possibility of new JE cases persist till September, this year [2019], the decline in the number of deaths from the deadly viral disease in the 1st half of August itself has shown that the efforts and sincerity of the health officials have yielded a positive outcome. Alarmed over the JE menace, central teams visited Assam during 30 Jun-1 Jul [2019] and 8-10 Jul [2019] to review the situation and provide technical assistance to the state.

"June-July is the peak season for JE outbreak. Naturally, we were expecting that JE cases will come down from August. But this year [2019], eventually the administrative system took immediate measures after the JE menace set alarm bells ringing in the state this monsoon," said an NHM official.

While on an average, 25-35 fresh cases of JE were reported on a daily basis during the peak period in mid-July [2019], this week (from Sunday to Friday [4-9 Aug 2019]) a total of 13 JE-positive cases were reported on [Wed 7 Aug 2019] -- the highest number of deaths in a day in that period of time. From Sunday to Friday, a total of 4 JE death cases have been confirmed by NHM.

From January, a total of 606 JE-positive cases were reported from various parts of the state, while the death toll due to the viral disease has touched 142 in Assam.

Health experts say mosquito-borne diseases are usually prevalent in Assam mainly due to wet weather conditions and dense vegetation. But this year [2019], JE has spread out from the upper Assam region to across the state, with pig-rearing for earning livelihood gaining popularity across the state. Pigs and wild birds are the main carriers of the JE virus mainly during the monsoon season, when stagnant water creates conducive atmosphere for breeding of the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito -- the primary vector.

[Interestingly, no mention is made above of cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) whereas the previous report stated that according to the National Health Mission (NHM) 23 Jul 2019 report, a total of 222 deaths have occurred in the state since January [2019] due to JE and AES. The number of deaths due to JE alone in that earlier report is not given. Currently, the number of JE deaths has now increased to 142. The earlier NHM report further stated that the total number of JE/AES positive cases during this period was 1569. - Mod.TY]

As many as 54 children have died over the past few weeks due to the acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and over 130 have been hospitalised till now in Bihar's Muzaffarpur.

A total of 46 patients died at Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), while 8 succumbed at the private Kejriwal Hospital in Muzaffarpur.

Earlier on [Thu 8 Aug 2019], Civil Surgeon Shailesh Kumar Singh said, "47 children have died due to AES and 137 are admitted in hospitals with high fever and other symptoms of the infection. 137 people were admitted in SKMCH hospital out of whom 40 causalities were reported."

Apart from this, Singh had said: "41 people were admitted in Kejriwal Hospital where 7 causalities were reported, taking the death toll to 47."

Encephalitis is a viral infection which causes mild flu-like symptoms such as high fever, convulsions, and headaches.

Over the past few weeks, there have been at least 100 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] -- a neurological condition triggered by a biochemical imbalance in the body -- in the state of Bihar. In the city of Muzaffarpur, there are reports of at least 109 children that have died after "inflammation and infection" that targets the brain.

According to a CNN report, 2 hospitals in the region alone have more than 400 children complaining of fever, dizziness, and delirium have been admitted since the start of 2019. "Between 2008 and 2014, there have been more than 44 000 cases and nearly 6000 deaths from encephalitis in India, particularly in Uttar Pradesh [UP] and Bihar, according to a research paper published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research in 2017," the report reads.

However, there has been a lot of confusion and misinformation about the outbreak itself -- its cause, what makes children unusually vulnerable, and that strange connection to litchis [lychee], in news reports about the outbreak.

We spoke to Prof Dr Kishore Kumar, Chairman & Managing Director of Cloudnine Hospitals in Bangalore to clarify some of the piling misinformation about the outbreak in Bihar.

Considering the confusion and doubts as to what this outbreak really is, can you clarify?
What happened in Uttar Pradesh 2 years ago was an infection and that infection is a fairly extreme medical condition. However, the breakout that is happening in Bihar right now is something called acute encephalitis syndrome -- this is an "encephalopathy" not technically an infection, that is, "encephalitis".

An encephalopathy, simply put, is an umbrella term for a disease, damage, or malfunction in the brain, ranging in symptoms that are mild (like memory loss or subtle personality changes) to severe (like dementia, seizures, coma, or even death). In a case of acute encephalitis syndrome however, there is no bacterium or virus involved. An epidemic of AES would typically happen around mid-April to mid-June, at the start of monsoon and litchi season.

Just last year [2018], there was a study looking into what the issue is here. It's quite clear that while the infection itself (encephalitis) also affects UP, this particular outbreak isn't an infection -- it has to do with malnutrition and access to a lot of litchis.

So, if it's not an infection, what's causing it?
The vast majority of AES victims in Bihar were undernourished children, who didn't eat a meal at night before falling asleep. When people -- particularly children, who have considerably lower levels of body fat than adults -- sleep without eating dinner, their body depends on reserves of glycogen released by the liver, the organ in which fat is also broken down in our body. Glucose, which is the main currency of energy in the body, is stored in the form of glycogen in the liver. In undernourished kids more so than adults, these stores are low -- sometimes dangerously so.

When glycogen reserves are depleted in the liver, the body draws energy from less-ideal sources like muscle and connective tissue. This reaction -- which also takes place in the liver -- produces many products like ketones and amino acids that can be neurotoxic at above-average levels, that is, they can have damaging effects on the brain or peripheral nervous system if their levels are "high" in the bloodstream. We're seeing symptoms of this damage in the children in Bihar.

How are AES and litchis connected?
In undernourished people, the body turns to sources like lactate or proteins to produce glucose (the only natural energy currency powering normal brain function) in a process called gluconeogenesis. With litchis widely-farmed in UP, children may consume litchis in abundance simply because it is readily available in their farms and homes. There's a very simple reason AES affects undernourished children and not healthy ones. A series of studies from similar incidents of AES in the past by Jacob Jon, a senior paediatrician in Vellore, proves there's a link between an enzyme in litchis and instances of AES.

The enzyme methylenecyclopropylglycine (mercifully called 'MCPG') in litchis can trigger a stark overnight dip in sugar levels (a condition called hypoglycaemia) because it blocks a key enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis. In malnourished kids, this cut-off from sources of energy other than glycogen can cause fever, convulsions and at times, a loss of consciousness.

Health experts have attributed heat and humidity to the large number of AES cases as well. Is this possible?
Heat waves can contribute to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, but a glucose imbalance points to something else being the cause.

[As noted in comments on several previous posts, the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. As noted previously, some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption as noted above, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined and the etiologies mentioned ruled in or out, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY]
