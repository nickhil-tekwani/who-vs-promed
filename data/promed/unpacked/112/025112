Health officials are investigating an outbreak of food poisoning which
affected 80 guests at a 5-star hotel in Greater Manchester. Diners
reported dizziness and vomiting after attending a charity dinner at
The Lowry Hotel in Salford in October 2011. A spokeswoman for the
Health Protection Agency (HPA) said its investigation with Salford
City Council was ongoing. The Lowry Hotel said it was carrying out a
full and in-depth investigation with environmental health experts.

The HPA said the guests suffered from campylobacter, a bug which can
be caused by undercooked meat. Dr Rosemary McCann, a consultant with
the HPA's Greater Manchester unit, said: "Investigations are still
ongoing, including analysis of a questionnaire returned by guests.
Environmental health officers from Salford City Council are working
with the hotel."

General manager of The Lowry Hotel, Peter Kienast, said: "We are very
sorry to hear that a number of guests fell ill following a function at
our hotel in October. We are determined to get to the cause of the
issue and the detailed investigation is reviewing every stage of the
process from the food source itself to its delivery."

He added: "This is the 1st incident of its kind in The Lowry Hotel's
past 10 years. We are in contact with the organisers of the event and
assisting them with any needs they may have as the investigation
continues."

[Although fever and diarrhea are the most common symptoms associated
with campylobacteriosis, prominent vomiting and/or bloody diarrhea can
also occur. Additionally Guillain-Barre syndrome may occur as a
sequela to enteric campylobacteriosis. Undercooked chicken is a quite
common vehicle for the infection in man.

Regarding vomiting as a symptom, Gillespie and colleagues (Gillespie
IA, O'Brien SJ, Frost JA, et al: Investigating vomiting and/or bloody
diarrhoea in Campylobacter jejuni infection. J Med Microbiol.
2006;55: 741-746) suggested that an increased inoculum might account
for this as seen in the abstract:

"_Campylobacter jejuni_ infection frequently presents as acute
enteritis with diarrhea, malaise, fever and abdominal pain. Vomiting
and bloody diarrhea are reported less frequently. To investigate
potential host, micro-organism or environmental factors that might
explain the different clinical presentations, the features of
laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ cases presenting with
vomiting and/or bloody diarrhea were compared with cases who did not
report either clinical manifestation. Single variable analysis and
logistic regression were employed. Explanatory variables included
food, water and environmental risks. Cases who reported vomiting
and/or bloody diarrhea tended to suffer a longer illness and were more
likely to require hospital admission.

"Independent risks identified were being a child, female gender,
consumption of poultry other than chicken, pre-packed sandwiches and
sausages, and reported engineering work or problems with
drinking-water supply. A dose-response relationship with vomiting
and/or bloody diarrhea and increasing daily consumption of unboiled
tap water was observed also. Vomiting and/or bloody diarrhea
characterized the more severe end of the disease spectrum and might
relate to host susceptibility and/or infective dose. The role of
unboiled tap water as a potential source of _C. jejuni_ infection in
England and Wales requires further investigation." - Mod.LL]
