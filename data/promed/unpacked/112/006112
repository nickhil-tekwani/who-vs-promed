Vesicular Stomatitis (VS) in Texas Update
-----------------------------------------
Since the [17 Sep 2014] update, the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) received confirmation of one new case of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in horses. The premises is located 13 miles southeast of Bastrop in Bastrop County.

Of the 62 premises, 50 premises have been released. Seven counties have been released from quarantine: Jim Wells, Kinney, Nueces , San Patricio, Val Verde, Williamson, and Hidalgo counties.

The newly identified infected premises are currently under quarantine by the TAHC. Affected horses will be monitored by regulatory veterinarians while under quarantine. Premises are eligible for quarantine release 21 days after all lesions have healed.

Logan County [Colorado] has one location under active quarantine for vesicular stomatitis.

The latest update from the Colorado Department of Agriculture [CDA] on the statewide outbreak shows that 303 quarantines have been enacted since the livestock disease 1st hit Colorado this year [2014]; 177 of the quarantines have been released.

Logan County was listed as a newly affected county as of [10 Sep 2014] by the CDA, and that one quarantine is still in effect. Counties with the highest number of active quarantines include Larimer (48), Weld (24) and Boulder (20). Altogether, 10 Colorado counties have at least one quarantine still in effect.

While the number of new cases of VS continues to rise -- there were 6 new quarantine locations in the last week -- State Veterinarian Dr. Keith Roehr is hopeful that the spread of the disease is slowing.

"The good news is that the number of new cases are decreasing while the number of released quarantines are increasing; we believe that's a sign that we've hit the peak of this disease in Colorado for this year," he said in the CDA update.

VS is a virus that usually affects horses, mules, cattle, bison, sheep, goats, pigs, and camelids; human cases are possible but rare. The 2014 outbreak has affected mostly horses, cows have also tested positive in Larimer, Weld and Boulder counties.

The transmission of vesicular stomatitis, and the relative importance of the different transmission routes for each virus, is incompletely understood.

Insect vectors seem to introduce vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) into populations of domesticated animals. Important biological vectors include sand flies (_Lutzomyia_ sp.) and blackflies (family Simuliidae). Culicoides midges may also be biological vectors. Blackflies can transmit VSV-NJ to uninfected blackflies feeding at the same time on an uninfected host. Transovarial transmission has been demonstrated in sandflies and blackflies, and it may be possible in Culicoides. VSV has also been isolated from _Aedes_ mosquitoes, Chloropidae (eye gnats), and flies in the genus _Musca_ or family Anthomyiidae; these insects may act as mechanical vectors. In addition, grasshoppers (_Melanoplus sanguinipes_) can be infected experimentally, and cattle that ingest experimentally infected grasshoppers develop clinical signs. There is also some speculation that VSV could be a plant virus found in pastures, with animals at the end of an epidemiological chain.

Once it has been introduced into a herd, vesicular stomatitis can spread from animal to animal by direct contact. Broken skin or mucous membranes may facilitate entry of the virus. Infected animals shed VSV in vesicle material, saliva, and to a lesser extent, in nasal secretions. In experimentally infected horses, VSV has been found in the saliva of animals with or without oral lesions. Fecal shedding has been reported occasionally in experimentally infected swine, but it has not been seen in horses. VSV does not appear to be shed in milk. Animals can also be infected by exposure to contaminated fomites including food, water and milking machines. VSV in saliva can survive for 3-4 days on fomites; however, this virus is inactivated by sunlight, and does not remain viable for long periods in the environment except in cool, dark places. Experimental infection of livestock by aerosols has been demonstrated, but this route did not result in skin lesions in most species. VSV does not appear to cross the placenta or cause fetal seroconversion.

The reservoir and amplifying hosts for VSV are unknown. Viremia sufficient to infect insect vectors has not been reported in any domesticated or wild animal; however, insects could become infected by feeding on lesion material or contaminated secretions. Overwintering has been reported in some but not all outbreaks in the US.

Humans may be infected by contact with the lesions or secretions from infected animals, particularly vesicular fluid and saliva. Aerosol transmission occurs in laboratories. In addition, some people are probably infected through insect bites.

Because of the insect involvement, it is likely that a frost will kill off some of the insect vectors and decrease the outbreaks of this virus.
