An unknown disease has claimed around 70% of oranges in [parts of] East District. A local farmer [said] that flowering and fruiting of the oranges were excellent this [2020] season. However, the oranges were just about ready for plucking when the fruits started dropping, he said. Around 70-90% of the orange production has been lost. The farmers are presently collecting the fallen semi-ripe oranges. "We are burying our damaged oranges because it could infect our fruit-bearing trees. We do not want the disease to spread." The farmers of this area request the state government and horticulture department to visit for some support.

[The] horticulture secretary reported that the department would immediately dispatch a team [that] will conduct an investigation to understand why the fruits are falling before ripening and what kind of disease is causing it. "We had similar incidents in [the] past, but this time it looks like the dropping of fruits is on a large scale. We will try to find the chief cause and take appropriate action on a priority," [he] said. If there are any deficiencies like lack of soil nutrition or requirement of pest control, the department will extend all help to the farmers.

[Numerous diseases of citrus are being reported from the region, as well as multifactorial "dieback" complexes, which may also include additional environmental factors. It is not clear which specific problem is reported here. While disease management for most citrus pathogens includes clean planting stock and elimination of pathogen reservoirs, conclusive diagnosis of the pathogen(s) involved is needed to design effective management strategies.

It is thought that combinations of various pathogens may have contributed to the general decline of citrus health in the region due to accumulation of parasitic pathogens in old orchards over time. Extensive harvest failures have led to citrus replanting programmes (ProMED-mail post 20080130.0375), but these will only be of long term benefit if linked to an ongoing crop sanitation and monitoring programme to prevent re-introduction of pathogens, especially into orchards used as sources for propagating material.
