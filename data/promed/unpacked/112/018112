End of Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [Congo
DR] has on 16 Feb 2009 declared the end of the Ebola epidemic in the
Mweka and Luebo health zones in the Province of Kasai Occidental. The
last person to be infected by the virus died on 1 Jan 2009. This is
more than double the maximum incubation period (42 days) for Ebola
[haemorrhagic fever].

As of today [Tue 17 Feb 2009], the health authorities have reported a
total of 32 cases, including 15 deaths from Ebola. These 32 cases
include confirmed, probable, and suspect cases. During this outbreak,
Ebola virus [infection] was confirmed by laboratory tests at the
Institut National de Recherches Biologiques (INRB) in Kinshasa, the
Centre International de Recherches Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF)
in Gabon, and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases
(NICD), South Africa.

The WHO Country Office, Regional Office, and Headquarters supported
the MoH in Kinshasa and in the field at the location of the outbreak.
The international response to the outbreak also involved UNICEF, the
UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and the
World Food Programme (WFP), as well as support from Caritas
(Belgium), and the Congolese (DRC) Red Cross, together with partners
in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), including
the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) of the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC), CIRMF, and NICD, and Medecins Sans
Frontieres (Belgium).

[Disappointingly, this official statement from the WHO leaves
unresolved the precise status of the probable and, more
interestingly, the suspected cases (together more than half the total).
