New coronavirus, probably from dogs, infects people in Malaysia and Haiti
----------------------------------------
Early in 2017, a team of medical personnel, including doctors, nurses and volunteers, returned home to Florida after volunteering at a clinic in Haiti. Soon after their return, 20 members of the team began to feel a bit under the weather. "They had a slight fever and didn't feel 100% right," says virologist John Lednicky at the University of Florida. "But they weren't very sick."

At the time [2017], Zika virus was circulating in Haiti, and health officials were worried the travelers might have been infected, potentially importing the mosquitoborne illness to Florida. So officials took urine samples from each traveler. The standard PCR tests for Zika virus came back negative. But Lednicky wasn't satisfied. He had a hunch that the urine samples did contain a virus -- not Zika but something else.

So he took a little bit of the urine from 6 of the travelers and added it to a special solution of monkey cells. The goal was deceptively simple: to see if any viruses in the urine would infect the monkey cells, start replicating and grow to detectable levels. Then Lednicky could collect the virus's genes and identify it. "This is what we do in our lab," Lednicky says. "We cast a wide net. We try to isolate viruses. And oftentimes, when we do that, the unexpected happens."

"We found a coronavirus," he says. And not just any coronavirus, but one that many scientists believe may be a new human pathogen -- likely the 8th coronavirus known to cause disease in people. It turns out, this coronavirus in the Haiti travelers has cropped up previously, on the other side of the globe.

In May [2021], scientists at Duke University reported they had detected a nearly identical virus coronavirus in children at a Malaysian hospital. The researchers found the virus in the upper respiratory tract of 3% of the 301 patients they tested in 2017 and 2018.

The genetic sequence of the Malaysian virus suggested it likely originated in dogs and then jumped into people. "The majority of the genome was canine coronavirus," virologist Anastasia Vlasova told NPR in May [2021]. The researchers had no evidence that the virus could spread among people or that it was widespread around the world. "These human infections with ... canine coronaviruses appear to be isolated incidents which did not lead to extensive human transmission," virologist Vincent Racaniello wrote on the Virology Blog.

Some scientists also think doctors and researchers should start actively looking for this virus in patients. "I think that's important for several reasons," says virologist Linda Saif at Ohio State University, who has studied coronaviruses for about 40 years. "No. 1, this virus has been associated with a number of pneumonia cases in children, and No. 2, we really don't know if it can transmit from human to human," she adds. The fact that scientists detected the almost-identical viruses in both Haiti and Malaysia, at the same time, suggests the virus does spread among people, Saif says.

"There's a temporal sequence here. These 2 viruses -- which are very, very similar -- have been detected in a similar time frame but in widely separated regions of the world," she explains. That could happen if a nearly-identical virus was circulating in dogs in both Haiti and Malaysia and then jumped over to people in both countries during the same year. "I would be very surprised if that happened," Saif says. The 2nd hypothesis is that the virus is circulating in people, at low levels, in many parts of the world, under the radar. "That hypothesis is more likely," Saif says. If that hypothesis turns out to be true, this canine coronavirus will be the 8th coronavirus known to spread among humans.

On the surface, these new findings sound like horrible news. The last thing the world needs right now is another coronavirus -- one that may trigger pneumonia in children. But Jonna Mazet says it's actually good news because it means scientists have caught this virus before it has caused a big problem. "The very exciting part is that people are starting to do virus discovery and characterization, even when large groups of people aren't dying and or getting severely ill, which is how most virus discovery has happened in the past," says Mazet, who's an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis and the founding executive director of the One Health Institute there.

By finding this virus early, scientists now have time to study it, create tools to diagnose it and understand what it might take to stop it. Although it's not a cause for deep concern at this time, there's a risk the virus could evolve and become a bigger problem, Mazet says, as was likely the case with SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. "Almost certainly, SARS-CoV-2 was circulating for quite some time and making people either a tiny bit sick or not sick enough to be noticed," she says. If scientists had detected it at this stage, perhaps the world would have had time to develop a test for it, some promising treatments and even a preliminary vaccine. Perhaps the pandemic would have taken a much different -- perhaps less deadly course.

"We need to find these novel viruses well before they fully adapt to humans and become a pandemic problem," writes epidemiologist Gregory Gray, from the University of Texas Medical Branch, in an email to NPR. "Fortunately, today we have the tools to both detect and evaluate the risk of such novel viruses. We just need the political will and financial support to do so."

[Currently 7 coronaviruses are known to cause infections with disease in humans. Four are associated with mild upper respiratory symptoms consistent with the "common cold" (229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 [https://www.cdc.gov/]). The other 3 are associated with severe respiratory disease -- SARS-CoV-1 (2003), MERS-CoV (2012 to present) and SARS-CoV-2, the virus associated with COVID-19.

Vlasova and colleagues identified a novel alpha coronavirus in 8 (2.5%) of 301 children hospitalized with pneumonia in Sarawak, Malaysia, closely related to a canine coronavirus (ref 1) (see Mod. LK's comment on this paper in COVID-19 update (179): Singapore, canine coronavirus, saliva vs nasal swabs, WHO 20210522.8375930).

Lednicky and colleagues identified a novel coronavirus with 99.4% similarity with the recombinant canine coronavirus identified in Sarawak, Malaysia (ref 2) around the same time (2017], suggesting this novel coronavirus had been circulating "under the radar" in more than one geographic area, and suggesting this might parallel what happened with the SARS-CoV-2 virus before transmission significantly increased in Wuhan, China in late 2019.

The final paragraph of the NPR article concludes with a sobering statement from epidemiologist Gregory Gray: "We need to find these novel viruses well before they fully adapt to humans and become a pandemic problem. Fortunately, today we have the tools to both detect and evaluate the risk of such novel viruses. We just need the political will and financial support to do so." Have lessons been learned from our ongoing experience with COVID-19? Will there be the political will and financial support?

Dogs are known to suffer 2 disease entities caused by coronaviruses: canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV; an alphacoronavirus) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV; a betacoronavirus). Their main characteristics are the following (ref 3):

Virus : Primary Target Organ(s) / Primary Host Cell / Disease-Symptoms / Transmission

CECoV : GI tract / Enterocyte / Mild gastroenteritis and diarrhea; rarely, severe enteritis and systemic signs / Fecal-oral

CRCoV : Respiratory tract / Respiratory epithelia / Mild upper respiratory disease / Aerosol

It will be interesting to check if the novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus in humans, addressed in the above report, is identified in pets and if it causes clinical (enteric?) signs in such animals.
