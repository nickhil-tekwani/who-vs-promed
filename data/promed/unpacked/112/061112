[1] Case update
22 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation Democratic Republic of Congo, Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=8853a1b289

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 22 Jun 2018
- a total of 55 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 3 suspected;
- 3 new suspicious cases in Iboko;
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola virus disease since the beginning of the epidemic;
- the last confirmed case dates back to 6 Jun 2018;
- the last contact will be taken from the contact list on 27 Jun 2018.

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

In this 2nd episode of our program Update on the Riposte [response, English], we present how the Ministry of Health coordinated the entire response to the Ebola outbreak.

This program is broadcast in French and Lingala on the following national channels: RTNC, TV 50, CCTV, B-One, Lingala Easy, Molière, Antenna A, Siloe TV and Top Congo. [MM]

[The video describes how, under the leadership of the DRC MoH, the response has been coordinated. It includes 5 rules for prevention, which will be discussed in a future post. - Mod.LK]

[Although 3 new suspected cases are reported, no suspected cases have been confirmed as Ebola since 6 Jun 2018. As has been commented on in previous posts, it would be informative to know the etiology of these unconfirmed cases, or even whether they are being diagnosed.

There are only a few days left before the last of the contacts is cleared, which will be a noteworthy event. But it is still important that vigilance be maintained, since we know from the West African outbreak that sexual transmission can occur for a lengthy period of time following recovery. And, in addition, because of the remoteness of the DRC outbreak, there may be infected individuals who were missed.

- 23 Jun 2018. How Ebola Vaccines Have Helped to Usher in a New Era in the Outbreak Response

[excerpt:]
No new cases have been reported for 2 weeks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

When Ebola flared up in the Democratic Republic of the Congo last month [May 2018], a wave of international public health workers had just left the country, where they had been deployed to combat cholera. But less than 2 weeks after leaving, some were rushing back to help with the new crisis.

Alhassane Touré was among them. As the physician who quickly became the coordinator of the World Health Organization's efforts to roll out an experimental anti-Ebola inoculation in the DRC, he was needed on the ground. At home in Guinea, he had headed up a very successful Ebola vaccine effort 3 years earlier, helping to deploy an experimental shot after the West African crisis had already gripped the region. But this time around, his team had access not just to the experimental vaccine, but also to financial support that would allow them to offer the inoculation near the start of an Ebola outbreak and try to contain it relatively early. ...

With the help of DRC community health workers who fostered acceptance of the vaccine -- developed by New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant Merck -- Touré's team has vaccinated 1611, including 574 frontline health workers. Doctors Without Borders has also been offering the shot, and, in total, more than 3000 vaccines have been administered in the country. ...

Public health workers say they are far from declaring the outbreak over; that pronouncement typically comes one day after 2 21-day incubation periods pass with no new cases. Such a count begins after the confirmed recovery of the last ill patient or after the last Ebola-related burial. The most recent burial was on 10 Jun 2018, the WHO says, but the official count has not yet started because the organization is not sure that that was the last case. Ebola responders know a single missed case could reignite the chain of transmission, so they must remain vigilant for anyone with possible symptoms and check on the contacts of known Ebola patients. For now, case numbers remain relatively stable. There have been more than 60 probable or confirmed cases and 28 deaths.

With much of the focus now on careful surveillance, Touré's team is grappling with the difficulties of continuing to monitor the vaccinated individuals for the 3-week period following their shots, a key requirement for the team's real-time study on the experimental Merck vaccine. On 3 separate occasions -- on or close to days 3, 14 and 21 after vaccination -- health workers must meet with the inoculated person, ask questions about the individual's health status and check for a fever. But people are not always reachable in person or by phone. The electricity and cell phone coverage have been spottier than when the team worked in Guinea, Touré says. This has made communication and coordination incredibly difficult. There are other obstacles, too: the difficulty of reaching people in remote areas on difficult roads that are sometimes muddy and the need to tamp down the rumors and distrust that often plague responses to major outbreaks.

That means health care workers must return to remote sites again and again, traversing bad roads via motorbike or car for a face-to-face check-in. If they do not find the vaccinated person, team members keep trying for 30 days before they give up and note in their official records that the person was lost to follow-up, Touré explains.

Selecting whom to vaccinate in the 1st place hinges on reports from community health workers, the DRC's Ministry of Public Health and other involved parties. The WHO and Doctors Without Borders are vaccinating people who are either direct contacts of Ebola patients or "contacts of contacts," a rough categorization typically determined by geographic proximity. For example, it includes neighbors, extended family members and people who live with high-risk contacts.

Finding all those people can be difficult in DRC communities. Many do not have cell phones, and health workers' records may not include the correct addresses or even accurate spellings of names. People may also move or travel, which makes them difficult to track, says Jonathan Polonsky, a WHO epidemiologist and one of the coordinators of surveillance activities and contact tracing at Mbandaka.

One day, Polonsky says, his team received a list of 25 names of direct contacts of probable or confirmed Ebola cases whom community health workers had been unable to track down, so the list had been escalated to specialists like him. "We were going on very little. We didn't have an address in some cases, or sometimes we didn't even know the general area," he says.

It turned out, however, that through sheer persistence, some of those people were relatively easy to find: "In one case, the person just lived across the road from the address we had down," he says. After spending about an hour and a half going from street to street looking for one individual on the list based on his name and the fact that he was a doctor, Polonsky explained, the team was able to find him only after finally realizing his name had been spelled incorrectly. Some of the missing 25 -- fewer than 10 -- have not been found, out of roughly 300 people that Polonsky's team was tasked with locating in Mbandaka, he says. Even with the Ebola case numbers remaining steady in recent weeks, those are the people he continues to worry about.

Last weekend, after 5 weeks in the DRC, Polonsky was sent home to rest. Yet even now, he says he still thinks about those missing people and wonders whether they could be out there sick, or perhaps making others sick. "It's frustrating," he says. "It's always a nagging thought."

[It is not clear whether people who are high risk of being contacts are being vaccinated preemptively, such as taxi drivers. Vaccination of drivers who actually had contact with sick individuals while transporting them to the emergency clinics has been done, as discussed in ProMED-mail post Ebola update (23): Congo DR, cases, vacc. campaign targets, vaccine development 20180601.5834040, but it might be more efficient and safer to vaccinate such individuals to provide protective immunity before they are exposed, as is being done with health care providers. As long as records of who has received a vaccination are maintained, tracking drivers post-exposure would not be as urgent as it is when they are fully susceptible. - Mod.LK
