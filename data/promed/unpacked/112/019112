[Russia's official follow-up report to the OIE, dated 20 Aug 2005,
specified 6 affected areas: Altai Territory (5 affected districts), Tiumen
Region (3), Omsk Region (3), Kurgan Region (6), Chelyabinsk Region
(2) and Novosibirsk Region (4 affected districts). According to later
(media) reports, the republics of Kalmykia and Altai were added, when a
single duck shot by a huntger was reportedly found infected with a "H5"
influenza virus, without further detail. The Altai territory ("Krai") and
Altai republic are 2 different, though neighbouring, entities. The republic
is situated southeast of the krai (see map at
<http://www.oie.int/cartes/RUS050729.jpg>).
