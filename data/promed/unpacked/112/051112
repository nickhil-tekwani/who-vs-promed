TICKS IN MADAGASCAR?
====================
Date: Fri, 16 May 1997 14:34:45 -0400 (EDT)
From: REJunge@aol.com
I am a veterinarian working on diseases of lemurs in captivity and in
Madagascar. I recently heard the statement that there are no ticks in
Madagascar. There certainly are numerous reports of disease transmission
(malaria, arboviruses) via mosquitos, but I am not aware of any tick-borne
diseases, or of any reports of species of ticks found there.
Anyone knowledgable in Malagasy entomology?
