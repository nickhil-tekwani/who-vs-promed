Naturally acquired human _Plasmodium knowlesi_ infection, Singapore.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report a case of naturally acquired _Plasmodium knowlesi_ in
Singapore, a malaria-free country. Diagnosis was confirmed by PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] with validated species-specific primers.
In industrialized countries, free-ranging primates are a potential
source of _P. knowlesi_ human infection. _P. knowlesi_ infection is a
differential diagnosis of febrile illness acquired in Singapore.

area of Singapore (Lim Chu Kang, in northwestern Singapore) inhabited
by macaque monkeys , which are known to harbor the parasite. - Mod.JW]

Philippines. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. May 2008; 14(5)]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Five human cases of infection [4 fatal] with the simian malaria
parasite _Plasmodium knowlesi_ from Palawan, the Philippines were
confirmed by nested PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. This study
suggests that this zoonotic infection is found across a relatively
wide area in Palawan and documents autochthonous cases in the country.

Conclusion
----------
This report extends the geographic range of human _P. knowlesi_
infections from Thailand, Myanmar, peninsular Malaysia, and Malaysian
Borneo to Palawan Island in the Philippines. Although the parasite
has been isolated from local macaques in the Philippines in 1961 and
1978, this report documents autochthonous human cases in the country.
Major progress in malaria control has been achieved in many malarious
areas in the Philippines. However, _P. knowlesi_ forms a previously
unrecognized pool of infections that may be maintained in forested
areas through its presence in a simian reservoir, despite control
efforts in the human population. Current data suggest that human
knowlesi malaria is strictly a zoonotic disease. To confirm this
theory, further knowledge of the dynamics of human infection is needed.

Rahman HA, Conway DJ, Singh B: _Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in
humans is widely distributed and potentially life threatening. Clin
Infect Dis. 2008 Jan 15; 46: 165-71]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
Until recently, _Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in humans was
misdiagnosed as _Plasmodium malariae_ malaria. The objectives of the
present study were to determine the geographic distribution of _P.
knowlesi_ malaria in the human population in Malaysia and to
investigate 4 suspected fatal cases.

Methods
-------
Sensitive and specific nested polymerase chain reaction [PCR] was
used to identify all _Plasmodium_ species present in (1) blood
samples obtained from 960 patients with malaria who were hospitalized
in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, during 2001-2006; (2) 54 _P. malariae_
archival blood films from 15 districts in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo
(during 2003-2005), and 4 districts in Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia
(during 2004-2005); and (3) 4 patients whose suspected cause of death
was _P. knowlesi_ malaria. For the 4 latter cases, available clinical
and laboratory data were reviewed.

Results
-------
_P. knowlesi_ DNA was detected in 266 (27.7 percent) of 960 of the
samples from Sarawak hospitals, 41 (83.7 percent) of 49 from Sabah,
and all 5 from Pahang. Only _P. knowlesi_ DNA was detected in
archival blood films from the 4 patients who died. All were
hyperparasitemic and developed marked hepatorenal dysfunction.

Conclusions
-----------
Human infections with _P. knowlesi_, commonly misidentified as the
more benign _P. malariae_, are widely distributed across Malaysian
Borneo and extend to Peninsular Malaysia. Because _P. knowlesi_
replicates every 24 hours, rapid diagnosis and prompt effective
treatment are essential. In the absence of a specific routine
diagnostic test for _P. knowlesi_ malaria, we recommend that patients
who reside in or have traveled to Southeast Asia and who have
received a "_P. malariae_" hyperparasitemia diagnosis by microscopy
receive intensive management as appropriate for severe falciparum malaria.

[Ref: White, NJ: _Plasmodium knowlesi_: The fifth human malaria
parasite. Clin Infect Dis. 2008 Jan 15; 46: 172-3]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[The editorial highlights the following:

"Despite its simian preference, it is legitimate to claim _P.
knowlesi_ to be the 5th human malaria parasite. The studies of the
Kuching group, led by Balbir Singh and Janet Cox-Singh [Cox-Singh J
et al. _Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in humans is widely distributed
and potentially life threatening. Clin Infect Dis 2008; 46:165-71;
see [3] above], have changed this view radically. Investigating what
appeared initially to be an unusually high incidence of _Plasmodium
malariae_ infection, they have shown conclusively that P. knowlesi is
a major cause of malaria in Malaysia -- particularly on the island of
Borneo. _P. knowlesi_ has a daily (quotidian) cycle and, if
unchecked, can rapidly reach potentially lethal densities." - Mod.EP]

The case demonstrates that transmission of _P. knowlesi_ in Southeast
Asia is not new, and happened outside of Malaysia.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The study dissects the reactivity of different monoclonal antibodies
against _Plasmodium_ LDH [pLDH -- lactate dehydrogenase], and states:

"These data show that pLDH antibodies that detect _P. falciparum_ and
_P. vivax_ can also be used to detect and distinguish _P. knowlesi_.
The one major caveat is that a _P. knowlesi_ infection cannot be
distinguished from a mixed infection with both _P. vivax_ and _P.
falciparum_ in the blood."

[A rapid bench-top test like the antigen-capture assays using for
instance HRPII [histidine-rich protein II] proteins would be very
welcome. Diagnosis based on microscopy is unreliable and because of
it 24-hour life cycle, the infection may rapidly be life threatening. - Mod.EP]

[ProMED-mail usually does not publish already published material, but
the papers summarized here show that _P. knowlesi_ is much more
widespread in Southeast Asia than previously expected, even in areas
(Singapore) expected to be malaria free. The papers also indicate
that molecular typing of parasites needs to be introduced to be able
to distinguish _P. knowlesi_ from the 4 previously recognized human
malaria parasites. - Mod.EP]
