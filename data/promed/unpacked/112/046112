Two cases of the dreaded extreme [extensively] drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the world's most untreatable form of TB, have been detected in Pune district for the 1st time ever. While one patient is from the "peth" areas in Pune, the other is from Yamunanagar in Pimpri Chinchwad.

"These are the only 2 XDR-TB patients so far in Pune district, though as many as 46 similar cases have been detected in other places in the state in the last 2 years," S P Sabnis, joint director (TB), state public health department, told TOI on Friday [22 Mar 2013]. Of these 46 cases, Mumbai alone accounted for 42 cases.

Pune district has been continuously seeing cases of MDR-TB, with as many as 308 cases having been registered in Pune city, Pimpri Chinchwad and the rural areas.

India has 1/5th of the world's drug-resistant tuberculosis cases. TB has emerged as one of the most serious public health threats. With an estimated number of 66 000 multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases in 2011, India tops the chart in South-East Asia. The actual number of MDR-TB cases, which are extremely difficult to treat, could range from 55 000 to 77 000, though the overall prevalence is just above 2 per cent.

The South-East Asia region harbours 89 000 estimated MDR-TB cases (72 000-108 000) accounting for more than 1/4th of the world's estimated MDR-TB cases in 2011. India ranks 2nd after China," says the World Health Organisation's latest report. India is miles ahead of others in the region. The 2 worst figures after India come from Indonesia (6620) and Myanmar (5500). "We are not tackling MDR cases with seriousness, which is a mistake. Treating each MDR cases is 100 times more expensive than a regular TB case. The government needs to find MDR cases and treat them as quickly as possible," R Lakshminarayan, vice president (research) in the Public Health Foundation of India, who is not associated with the WHO report, told Deccan Herald.

Extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has been reported from 5 countries (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand) in the region. In December 2011, so called cases of "totally drug-resistant TB" that posed a big challenge to clinicians and public health authorities were reported in Mumbai.

As per the WHO estimates, prevalence and incidence rates of all forms of tuberculosis in India were respectively 249 and 181 per 100 000 population in 2011. As many as 24 persons (range is from a low of 15 to a high of 35) per 100 000 are killed by the bug. The spread and virulence of tuberculosis, particularly the resistant variety, compelled the central government to make TB a notifiable disease, which ensures reporting of TB cases from the private sector to the government programme and compulsory treatment. Patients jumping from one private doctor to another without completing the drug regimen contribute to a sharp increase in resistant TB cases.

[ProMED has previously posted reports on the problem India is having with MDR and XDR TB. MDR or multidrug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis that is caused by a strain of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin, 2 of the most effective drugs used to treat TB. XDR or extensively drug-resistant TB refers to tuberculosis caused by a subgroup of MDR-TB strains that are additionally resistant to any of the fluoroquinolone class of drugs (e.g., levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, or gatifloxacin) and any of the 3 injectable drugs used to treat tuberculosis (capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin).

1st line anti-TB drugs are: INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin; and 2nd line drugs are: amikacin, kanamycin, capreomycin, viomycin, fluoroquinolones, ethionamide, cycloserine, and para-aminosalicylic acid (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15971391). 3rd-line drugs include the macrolides (such as clarithromycin), clofazimine, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, linezolid, imipenem, high-dose isoniazid, and several new investigational drugs.

Referring to certain MDR strains from India as TDR-TB or totally drug resistant is problematic for several reasons. In January 2012, the WHO attempted to clarify the situation as follows (http://www.who.int/tb/challenges/mdr/tdrfaqs/en/index.html):

"The term "totally drug resistant" has not been clearly defined for tuberculosis. While the concept of "total drug resistance" is easily understood in general terms, in practice, in vitro drug susceptibility testing (DST) is technically challenging, and limitations on the use of results remain: conventional DST for the drugs that define MDR and XDR-TB has been thoroughly studied and consensus reached on appropriate methods, critical drug concentrations that define resistance, and reliability and reproducibility of testing. Data on the reproducibility and reliability of DST for the remaining SLDs [2nd-line drugs] are either much more limited or have not been established, or the methodology for testing does not exist.

"Most importantly, correlation of DST results with clinical response to treatment has not yet been adequately established. Thus, a strain of TB with in vitro DST results showing resistance could in fact, in the patient, be susceptible to these drugs. The prognostic relevance of in vitro resistance to drugs without an internationally accepted and standardised drug susceptibility test, therefore, remains unclear, and current WHO recommendations advise against the use of these results to guide treatment.

"Lastly, new drugs are under development, and their effectiveness against these "totally drug resistant" strains has not yet been reported.

"For these reasons, the term "totally drug resistant" tuberculosis is not yet recognised by the WHO. For now these cases are defined as extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), according to WHO definitions."

The number of XDR TB cases in India is likely unknown because anti-TB drug susceptibility tests are not being systematically performed for a variety of reasons (http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/growing-tuberculosis-threat?page=0,2): In 2010, only 5 percent of patients who needed drug susceptibility testing were screened, and only 2 percent of the estimated 99 000 patients with MDR-TB received 2nd-line drug treatment through the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP).

In a letter to the editor in the journal "Clinical Infectious Diseases" (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/11/24/cid.cir889.full), the authors say that patients, rather than seeking care in TB clinics where there is free treatment and drugs available under RNTCP, frequently seek help from private physicians who often mismanage their care: "A study that we conducted in Mumbai showed that only 5 of 106 private practitioners practicing in a crowded area called Dharavi [Dharavi, located in Mumbai, is one of the largest slums in the world] could prescribe a correct prescription for a hypothetical patient with MDR tuberculosis. The majority of prescriptions were inappropriate and would only have served to further amplify resistance, converting MDR tuberculosis to XDR tuberculosis and TDR tuberculosis."

Pune District in Maharashtra state of India had a population of 9 426 959 in 2011, making it the 4th most populous district in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune_district) and Pune city, the district headquarters, with a population of 3 115 431 in 2011, is the 9th largest metropolis in India, the 2nd largest in the state of Maharashtra after Mumbai (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune). Pune is 220 km (136.7 miles) southeast of Mumbai (http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/pocketmaps/mumbaipune.htm), where reports of problems with XDR TB were previously posted by ProMED-mail. Pimpri-Chinchwad, with population of 1 729 320, is a city in Pune district, located to the North-West of Pune on the Old Pune-Mumbai Highway. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimpri-Chinchwad). "Peth" is a term (from the Marathi language) for areas located within Pune City.
