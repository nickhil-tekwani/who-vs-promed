Bulgaria's Food Safety Agency has confirmed an outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] at an industrial farm in the village of Nikolovo in Bulgaria's Rousse [Ruse] province, 9 km [5.6 mi] from the border with Romania.

This is the 1st outbreak at an industrial farm, after cases of ASF [were] confirmed in various parts of Bulgaria in recent weeks at backyard holdings.

The agency said that the outbreak at the industrial farm, which holds 17 000 pigs, was confirmed by official laboratory tests.

The regional directorate of the Food Safety Agency in Rousse [Ruse] has issued an order banning the movement of pigs to and from the site. Checks have also been carried out on slaughterhouses to which pigs have been dispatched.

Meat and products derived from pigs from the farm are to be destroyed, the agency said.

The immediate culling of domestic pigs in a 3 km [2 mi] safety zone had been ordered.

In the 10 km [6 mi] monitoring zone, trading in and transporting of live pigs was forbidden.

[Un]authorised transportation and trade in domestic pigs would be penalised and the animals found to have been transported would be promptly and humanely killed, the agency said.

On [21 Jul 2019], inspections in Sofia's markets by the Food Safety Agency and the Sofia municipal inspectorate, were continuing. Checks were carried out at the market in Dolni Bogrov. A report by the Bulgarian National Television said that for several years, live pigs had not been sold at the market.

The market was not registered. While there were no live pigs, other breaches of regulations were found, such as non-compliance with regulations on the sale of eggs.

Inspectors repeated a warning to the public to be careful about food products in such places. The most commonly offered meat had not been tested for trichinosis, a parasite that can cause serious illness.

[For the location of Nikolovo in Ruse province of Bulgaria, see map at https://goo.gl/maps/AnN7oTuH5qTf8L4Q8. To view Bulgaria's ASF outbreaks since the beginning of 2019, please go to OIE's interactive ASF world map (data since 1 Jan 2019) at https://tinyurl.com/y58923jb; click on the Balkan area/Bulgaria, zoom in until the required resolution is obtained. By far, most of Bulgaria's ASF outbreaks are found within the oblasts (provinces) Pleven and Ruse, facing Romania. The map illustrates the severity of the ASF situation in several parts of Romania. Note the proximity of infected wild boars, in the provinces Teleorman and Calarasi, to the Bulgarian border.

The warning at the closure of the media report above is related to pork traded in open markets. Pig growers, particularly small-holders, may be driven to try getting their stock marketed the quickest, not necessarily through the formal channels, when facing a malady, before (and, in the worst scenario, after) its introduction. Such meat does not undergo veterinary inspection in official slaughterhouses (where the release of trichinae-infected pork is prevented). Illegal slaughter may lead to dissemination of infected pork, with lamentable consequences. - Mod.AS
