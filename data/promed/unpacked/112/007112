Officials from Gansu province in northwest China confirmed that 250
children from the province remain in hospital with excessive amounts
of lead in their blood, and a number of them are suffering from
severe lead poisoning.
Residents of Xinsi and Mouba villages were poisoned by a lead
smelting plant that continued to operate this summer after being told
to cease production, but has now been demolished.
Of those being treated in hospital, 4 are suffering from severe lead
poisoning, indicated by blood-lead levels above 450 milligrams of
lead per litre of blood. At least one child has lead levels of 619
milligrams. A total of 155 villagers were treated in hospital
suffering from mild lead poisoning, which is reached when blood
readings exceed 200 milligrams; 11 children had readings of 350
milligrams. The 88 other hospitalized villagers, including 8 adults,
have blood-lead levels that are considered excessive or above 100 milligrams.
Adults usually recover from mildly elevated lead levels but children
can suffer permanent impairment of their intelligence. People who
survive severe toxic lead levels are likely to suffer some permanent
brain damage.
The number of people reported hospitalized has risen by 79 since
Monday [11 Sep 2006], said Bao Fuzhen, head of the occupational
disease section of the Gansu provincial disease prevention and
control center. Bao said the 250 hospitalized children, all of whom
are under the age of 14, are being treated at both the Xijing
Hospital in the neighboring Shaanxi Province and at a local county
hospital. Regular examinations and clinical observation showed that
most of the patients are now in stable condition after being treated
with vitamin supplements.
The local hospital was unable to conduct blood tests to indicate lead
toxicity but has been urged to purchase the required medical devices.
A panel of experts from the Ministry of Health and the Gansu
provincial health department on Wednesday [13 Sep 2006] have
established a plan to provide more accessible blood tests for
villagers in the county.
Earlier figures provided by the Huixian county government show that
877 people from the villages have tested positive with excessive
amounts of lead in their blood. Their tests had to be conducted at
the Xijing Hospital in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, 300 kilometers away from Huixian County. Not all of those
with elevated lead levels have been hospitalized. The government of
the county has said it will provide subsidies to the villagers who
had to travel to Xi'an for tests.
The Huixian County Non-Ferrous Metal Smelting Co. Ltd. is being
blamed for causing the public health crisis and polluting the
environment. The soil within a radius of 400 meters around the
smelting plant has been polluted and the provincial environmental
protection bureau has ordered the smelter to be dismantled. The
former state-run plant was privatized in 1996 and produced about 5000
tons of lead a year. It failed to go through an environmental
assessment after its upgrade in 2004, and its waste disposal
equipment did not meet national standards. The factory continued to
operate secretly after being told to cease production earlier this year.
