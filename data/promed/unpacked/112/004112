[Mississippi] state health officials say the type of rabies confirmed earlier this week in a cat in Starkville came from a bat. This is the 1st rabies case confirmed in a land animal in Mississippi since 1961.

The cat is described as a small black and white kitten. Exposures to the rabid cat were 1st reported in downtown Starkville. The cat was then removed from the downtown area and dropped off in a remote area in the general vicinity of the Thad Cochran Research Park near the campus of Mississippi State University (MSU) where additional exposures occurred. [Who picked up the cat and removed it to another location? If it was stray and suspected to be rabid, why was it relocated? It sounds like suspicious activity and/or bites were not reported. - Mod.TG]

Further testing of the cat's brain tissue confirmed the cat was infected with rabies from a bat. Additionally, lab results of other animals found near the rabid cat were rabies-negative.

"We regularly identify bats with rabies in Mississippi, so these results tell us that the cat became infected after contact with an infected bat rather than contact with another animal," said Deputy State Epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers. "However, this serves as a reminder to never touch or handle bats, and if you do have exposure to a bat, contact your local healthcare provider and your provider can contact the Mississippi State Department of Health for consultation."

Rabies is a viral disease of mammals that is transmitted through the bite of an infected animal or through the contamination of a fresh wound with saliva from an infected animal. Rabies is completely preventable if post-exposure shots are administered after contact with a rabid animal.

Mississippians can help protect themselves against rabies by taking the following precautions:

- Do not handle or touch live or dead feral animals, animals you do not know, or wild animals such as raccoons, bats, skunks, foxes and coyotes that can carry rabies.

- If you see a dog or cat acting strangely, contact your local Animal Control officials.

- Vaccinate animals when your dog or cat has reached 3 months of age, 1 year later, and every 3 years thereafter (using a vaccine approved with 3 year immunity), as required by state law.

- A bat that is active by day, found in a place where bats are not usually seen, or that is unable to fly, and is easily approached, could have rabies and should be avoided.

- Wash any wound from an animal thoroughly with soap and water and seek medical attention immediately.

[This article does not tell us how many animals and people were exposed to this cat. It does not tell us if the people coming into contact with this cat required post-exposure prophylaxis.

This should be a warning to the local veterinarians and to the humane shelters to have rabies clinics to alert the public to this health threat. Dogs and cats should be vaccinated right way.

Likewise, horses and cattle should be vaccinated. While people may complain it is too costly to vaccinate cattle, with the high cost of cattle this is a cheap means of protection. Furthermore, most people have daily contact with their horses, and horses can get rabies, just as any mammal can. - Mod.TG
