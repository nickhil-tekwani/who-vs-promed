An additional horse has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, this month [May 2018] in Marion County.

The county has now had 5 total cases of EEE reported this year [2018], 4 involving horses and one an emu. All animals were unvaccinated for EEE.

Marion County remains under a mosquito-borne illness advisory due to the number of EEE cases identified locally. The risk of disease transmission from mosquitoes to humans through bites is increased.

EEE is a mosquito-borne virus 1st recognized in humans in 1938. It cycles between mosquitoes and birds in freshwater and swampy areas and is capable of infecting mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. The disease is 80 to 90 percent fatal in horses and emus and 30 to 45 percent fatal in humans.

Symptoms develop 3-10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito. The Sunshine State averages more than 60 reported cases of EEE in horses and 1-2 human cases annually.

"Residents and visitors should take preventive actions to avoid exposure to mosquitoes," said Mark Lander, of the Florida Department of Health in Marion County.

Lander recommends draining standing water around your home or property, covering your skin with clothing or repellent, and working with a veterinarian to have your horses vaccinated for EEE if they are not currently vaccinated.

Lander also suggested consulting a veterinarian or the University of Florida College of Large Animal Medicine for information on how to prevent EEE through vaccination in animals such as emus, alpacas and llamas.

The health department recommends draining standing water around homes and properties to stop mosquitoes from multiplying. They want to remind Central Florida residents that it only takes a bottle cap full of water standing still for one week to breed mosquitoes, so it's important to regularly check for and empty anything that could hold water.

Health department officials said garbage cans, buckets, pool or boat covers, tarps and flower pots all can hold excess water and should be emptied or cleared off weekly. Items such as old tires or litter should be disposed of so they don't collect water. And items like bird baths, pet bowls and water troughs should be emptied and scrubbed weekly, while plastic swimming pools should be emptied when not in use.

The department also recommends covering skin with clothing or repellent to further prevent mosquitoes from biting. For practical purposes, this means wearing shoes, socks, long sleeves and long, heavier material pants (such as denim as opposed to spandex or Lycra that's common in leggings).

Residents should cover doors and windows with screens to keep mosquitoes out of homes and repair any torn screening. They should use repellents that contain DEET, picardin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, para-methane-diol or IR3535 and apply the repellent to exposed skin or onto clothing, health department officials said.

Some repellents aren't suitable for children, so check before use and apply per directions. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, mosquito repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under 3 years old. DEET is not recommended on children younger than 2 months old. Use of mosquito nettings to protect children younger than 2 months old is recommended. For more information about repellents, see http://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents.

For residents who own animals such as emus or hunt wildlife, the health department recommends taking additional precautions. Emus infected with EEE virus can expose owners and other animals who are in direct contact with their waste, meat, organs, blood and bodily tissues. Contact a veterinarian or the Florida Department of Health in Marion County for information on how to safely handle potentially infected emus.

Some wildlife can also be infected with EEE or other mosquito-borne viruses. Do not harvest wild game that appears sick. And wear gloves when dressing or preparing meat from carcasses of game that appears healthy. Also, it is recommended to cook the meat well.

The health department is continuing to conduct statewide surveillance for mosquito-borne illnesses, including West Nile virus, EEE, St. Louis encephalitis, malaria, chikungunya and dengue. For more information and to learn more about EEE, visit http://www.floridahealth.gov.

[There is an effective vaccine for horses. If you have not vaccinated your horse, please do so. The vaccine is a 2-step vaccine, with the initial dose being administered and followed about 3 weeks later with a 2nd dose. The vaccine is combined with West Nile virus and often with tetanus. EEE immunity wanes somewhat quickly, and revaccination is needed approximately every 3-4 months in highly endemic areas, such as the Gulf of Mexico region or the eastern seaboard of the United States. - Mod.TG
