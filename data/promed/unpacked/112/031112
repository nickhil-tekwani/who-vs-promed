[3] Cholera - Philippines (South Cotabato Province)

The diarrhea outbreak in an upland community in T'boli town [South Cotabato, Soccsksargen region in Mindanao] that killed 2 children and affected 100 others in the last 2 weeks is now under control, health authorities said.

Dr Rogelio Aturdido, South Cotabato Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) chief, said no new cases of the disease have emerged from the affected areas in Barangay [the smallest administrative division in the Philippines] Basag in T'boli and local health workers are presently working on various interventions to prevent a similar outbreak in the area.

Aturdido said the cases of diarrhea in Barangay Basag were first reported on 24 May 2013 and continued until last week. He said 70 residents, mostly young children, were initially confirmed to have been infected with cholera, which was traced from contaminated water resources in the village. The T'boli Municipal Health Office later listed around 30 more affected residents during an outreach activity in the area, he said.

Aturdido said the IPHO's epidemiology and surveillance unit initially found traces of the cholera bacterium in samples taken from the village's drinking water sources.

He said residents mainly draw water for drinking and other household needs from a reservoir that turned out to have been contaminated due to some leaks on the steel pipes used for its water lines. Some residents also sourced their drinking water from contaminated wells, springs and other available water outlets, he added.
