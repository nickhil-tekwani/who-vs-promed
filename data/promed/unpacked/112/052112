The Missouri Departments of Agriculture [MDA], Conservation [MDC],
and Health and Senior Services [DHSS], and the US Department of
Agriculture [USDA] announced today [25 Feb 2010] that a captive
white-tailed deer in Linn County, Missouri has tested positive for
chronic wasting disease (CWD). CWD is a neurological disease found in
deer, elk and moose.

"There is no evidence that CWD poses a risk to domestic animals or
humans," said State Veterinarian Dr Taylor Woods. "We have protocols
in place to quickly and effectively handle these situations."

The animal that tested positive for CWD was a white-tailed deer
inspected as part of the State's CWD surveillance and testing
program. Preliminary tests were conducted by the USDA National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

Upon receiving the confirmed CWD positive, Missouri's departments of
Agriculture, Conservation and Health and Senior Services initiated
their CWD Contingency Plan. The plan was developed in 2002 by the
Cervid Health Committee, a task force comprised of veterinarians,
animal health officers, and conservation officers from USDA, MDA,
MDC, and DHSS working together to mitigate challenges associated with CWD.

CWD is transmitted by live animal to animal contact or soil to animal
contact. The disease was first recognized in 1967 in captive mule
deer in the Colorado Division of Wildlife captive wildlife research
facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. CWD has been documented in deer
and/or elk in Colorado, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota,
Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the Canadian Provinces
of Alberta and Saskatchewan. There has been no evidence that the
disease can be transmitted to humans.

"Missouri's proactive steps to put a testing protocol in place and
create a contingency plan years ago is proving beneficial. We are in
a solid position to follow pre-established steps to ensure Missouri's
valuable whitetail deer resource remains healthy and strong," said
Jason Sumners Missouri's Deer Biologist.

[This is the 1st case of CWD in Missouri. Kansas and Oklahoma already
have CWD cases in captive cervids.

While it is unfortunate for the cervid owner, one wonders how long
the deer had been on the premises and if this was a Missouri grown
deer or one that had been brought from elsewhere. It highlights the
need for accurate record keeping. Hopefully the herd owner will have
records regarding the deer. Most cervid owners in various states are
required to keep records of inventory, which animals are born on the
premises, which are bought or sold, and the individual the animal was
purchased or sold to. Those kinds of accurate records will assist the
state in their possible understanding of how the disease came to be
in their state. - Mod.TG]
