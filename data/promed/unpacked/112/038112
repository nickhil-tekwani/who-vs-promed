Risk of antibiotic resistant meningococcal infections in Hajj pilgrims
--------
Zumla A, Memish ZA

Editorial
---------
On 22 Jul [2019], Public Health England issued an important public health announcement, the unusual occurrence in the UK of 3 people with non-groupable meningococcal infections connected with recent travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia (1). Two presented with conjunctivitis just days after returning from a pilgrimage. The 3rd person, who was a close contact of one case but had not travelled to Mecca, developed invasive meningococcal disease (1). _Neisseria meningitidis_ isolates from all 3 individuals had the same phenotype (NG;NT;P1.15); they were resistant to ciprofloxacin and had only intermediate susceptibility to penicillin. Meningococcal conjunctivitis is known to carry a high risk of invasive disease (1-3) and requires immediate treatment, along with antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts.

Ciprofloxacin is the recommended chemoprophylaxis in both the UK and Saudi Arabia. The identification of resistant meningococcal conjunctivitis in people returning from Mecca highlights the urgent need to review currently recommended prophylactic measures for Hajj pilgrims, how best to prevent spread of _N. meningitidis_ between people attending mass gatherings, and how to protect contacts on return (4-6).

Over 2.2 million pilgrims (25â€‰000 from the UK) travelled from over 180 countries to Mecca, Saudi Arabia for the 2019 Hajj pilgrimage, which took place from 9 to 14 Aug [2019]. Pilgrims will make their way home over the next few weeks, and health services in destination countries need to be on heightened alert for imported pathogens with epidemic potential, including ciprofloxacillin [sic; ciprofloxacin-] resistant _N meningitidis_ (6). Continued global surveillance for meningococcal disease and antibiotic resistance, along with both epidemiological and molecular research, are essential to improve case detection, predict trends, and inform evolving prevention and control strategies (5).

The annual Hajj pilgrimage has been associated with repeated outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease. The largest occurred in 1974 (2673 cases), 1988 (1618 cases), 2000 (338 cases), and 2001 (316 cases) (7). Since 2001, the Saudi authorities have strictly enforced a visa requirement for pilgrims, mandating vaccination with a single dose quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine (A,C,W-135, and Y). Adherence is 98%, and no further major outbreaks have occurred (8).

However, meningococcal disease remains a priority public health threat at the Hajj because of the evolving nature of invasive disease, emergence of antibiotic resistance, diverse and varying geographical trends in serotypes other than A, C, W-135, and Y, fluctuations in incidence, and shifts in serogroups and genotypes which may increase epidemic potential (5).

Every year, the Saudi Ministry of Health updates immunisation and antibiotic prophylaxis requirements for pilgrims, and meningococcal vaccination remains compulsory (8). However, concerns have been raised about vaccine availability, and it has been suggested that adherence might have been compromised among pilgrims attending the 2019 Hajj (9). Furthermore, even vaccinated pilgrims remain susceptible to disease caused by serogroups B and X, which are not covered by the quadrivalent vaccine (10).

The high risk of meningococcal meningitis outbreaks, increasing incidence of serogroup B disease, and emergence of serogroup X in the African meningitis belt (5), from which a large number of pilgrims originate, are of particular concern. The Saudi Ministry of Health, therefore, mandates ciprofloxacin prophylaxis for pilgrims from meningitis belt countries (8). Over the past decade, 1.5 million doses of prophylactic ciprofloxacin have been administered to pilgrims at port of entry, and this has probably contributed to the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant _N meningitidis_ (11).

Authors of a recent large study of Hajj pilgrims (5) recommended reconsidering use of ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis and including serogroup B vaccines in pre-travel requirements since more than 60% of _N. meningitidis_ isolates from participants were B type. The current preventive measures for Hajj and other mass gatherings (12) require urgent review and should be regularly updated in accordance with changes in the epidemiology of meningococcal disease, including resistance, and the availability of new vaccines.

Meanwhile, as the 2.5 million pilgrims from the 2019 Hajj return home and an expected 7 million pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia for the Umrah mini pilgrimage over the next 12 months, questions remain about how best to protect them and their contacts from meningococcal disease. There is no room for complacency. Measures should include proactive clinical surveillance, education of 1st contact health professionals on the importance of taking a travel history, and a high index of suspicion for meningococcal infection among pilgrims who become ill on return. Public Health England has alerted NHS professionals of this need and provided management guidelines (13). Health authorities should do the same in all 180 home countries for Hajj pilgrims.

Ciprofloxacin-resistant cases of non-groupable meningococcal infection connected to recent travel to Mecca
-----------------------------------
Immunisation and Countermeasures Division, National Infection Service

Background and Interpretation:
Three non-groupable meningococcal isolates with ciprofloxacin resistance (which is highly unusual in the UK) have been identified in 2 cases of conjunctivitis and one case of invasive disease in England. Two of the cases developed symptoms within days of returning from Mecca; the 3rd case was in a member of the same local community as one of the other cases. All 3 isolates have identical phenotypes (NG;NT;P1.15) and intermediate penicillin susceptibility.

Meningococcal infection of the conjunctiva is considered an indication for public health action (i.e. treatment for the case and antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts) because of the high immediate risk of invasive disease. Vaccination is not usually indicated in cases or contacts of cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis due to the absence of ongoing risk.

Cases and outbreaks of meningococcal group A and group W infection associated with travel to Mecca as part of Hajj or Umrah have been observed in the past, most recently in 2000/2001 where over 40 serogroup W cases were observed in UK pilgrims and their contacts (1). Since then, all pilgrims have been required to have received MenACWY vaccine as part of the Hajj/Umrah visa. Approximate dates for the 2019 Hajj are 9 to 14 August [2019] (2), and, therefore, travel from the UK, together with the number of close contacts of pilgrims, is likely to increase over the next few weeks.

Infection due to non-groupable strains of meningococci is highly unusual in the UK, and such non-encapsulated strains rarely cause invasive disease (meningitis and/or septicaemia) in healthy individuals. Invasive disease caused by non-groupable meningococci may, therefore, indicate underlying immunodeficiency. In addition to inherited complement deficiencies, some medical conditions and treatments (in particular Eculizumab (Soliris; Alexion)), can lead to acquired or secondary complement deficiency, which can increase susceptibility to invasive meningococcal disease. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is recommended for close contacts of invasive meningococcal disease cases to eliminate established carriage from the close contact group, thereby reducing the likelihood of invasive disease and, importantly, onward transmission. Vaccination is not indicated following a case of non-groupable invasive meningococcal disease.

Please refer to UK guidance for further background information and public health advice (3).

Implications and recommendation for PHE Health Protection Teams
- Public Health action should not be delayed until antibiotic resistance testing results are available. Public Health management following reported cases of invasive meningococcal disease or conjunctival infection remains unchanged and in line with national guidelines (3).
- 1st line clinical treatment should continue to be 3rd generation cephalosporins (5), and cases treated with intravenous or intramuscular cephalosporins (for example ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) do not require antibiotic chemoprophylaxis (3). If the case (including conjunctivitis cases) has been treated with any other antibiotic, chemoprophylaxis should be offered.
- It is important that recent travel history, including place and dates of travel, are established for all cases of invasive meningococcal disease and meningococcal infection of the conjunctiva reported to PHE Health Protection Teams and that this information is recorded on HPZone.
- Features which may be consistent with the implicated strain include cases with recent travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia or with close links to recent pilgrims. Due to the high likelihood of ciprofloxacin resistance, rifampicin [rifampin] should be considered for 1st-line prophylaxis in close contacts of both invasive disease and conjunctivitis cases with these features. Rifampicin should also be offered for such cases not treated with cephalosporins. If ciprofloxacin has already been given, then HPTs should determine the antibiotic susceptibilities available from the NHS laboratory (4) and ensure the strain is referred to PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit, Manchester promptly. If the strain is confirmed as being due to a non-groupable meningococcus and/or if ciprofloxacin resistance is identified, close contacts of both invasive disease and conjunctivitis should receive prophylaxis with rifampicin.

For further advice, please contact the duty doctor at PHE Colindale (020 8200 4400) or the PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit (0161 276 6757).

The PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit and Immunisation Team will continue to monitor the situation in England and is actively liaising with international contacts and the Saudi authorities. The Immunisation Team will follow up any further cases of related invasive meningococcal disease that are reported in apparently healthy individuals to prompt appropriate referral for investigation of possible underlying immunodeficiency.

In line with national guidance, if invasive meningococcal disease or conjunctival infection are confirmed by a local diagnostic laboratory (including private laboratories), then the original sample, including extracts from PCRs, should be referred promptly to the PHE Meningococcal Reference Unit, Manchester to allow the capsular group to be confirmed or identified and for additional characterisation including whole genome sequencing and antibiotic resistance testing.

Lead public health microbiologists are requested to forward this briefing note to their local NHS laboratories/microbiologists who may be involved in the diagnosis and provision of advice on treatment of invasive meningococcal disease or meningococcal conjunctivitis.

[Invasive meningococcal disease (bacteremia and meningitis) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the nasopharynx and is spread person-to-person by respiratory droplets.

Household members and other close contacts who may be exposed to the index case's respiratory excretions have the highest documented risk for carriage and secondary invasive disease during the 1st 7 days after a case being detected. These contacts should receive antibiotic chemoprophylaxis as soon as possible to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and prevent secondary invasive disease.

Infection in the 3 individuals in the UK, linked to recent travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, was due to a non-groupable strain of _Neisseria meningitidis_ that is resistant to ciprofloxacin and has only intermediate susceptibility to penicillin.

Ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agent, had been an effective single-dose oral chemoprophylaxis agent. However, sporadic isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant meningococci began to appear in the Americas, Europe, Australia, China, and India. As a result, in 2008, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended ciprofloxacin should no longer be used for chemoprophylaxis of meningococcal disease in communities where ciprofloxacin-resistant strains have been identified (for example, selected US counties in North Dakota and Minnesota). Bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones is usually due to accumulation of point mutations in the genes (for example, gyrA and parC genes) encoding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, the targets for the fluoroquinolones.

Ceftriaxone and rifampin are alternative agents (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5707a2.htm). Azithromycin is also recommended in communities where ciprofloxacin resistance has been detected (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt08-mening.html).

Intermediate resistance to penicillin (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] 0.12 to 0.25 mcg/ml) has been infrequently reported due to decreased affinity of target penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin, and infection due to these strains has been reported to respond to penicillin therapy. Less commonly, high-level resistance to penicillin (MICs over 0.25 mcg/ml) has been reported due to production of a plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase production (https://jcm.asm.org/content/46/10/3208).

Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is commonest. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to protein. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens, because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

Infection due to non-groupable strains would not be expected to be prevented by vaccines in which the immunogenicity is based on a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide. The immunogenicity of these vaccines is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups or due to non-groupable strains that do not have the capsular polysaccharide present in the vaccine. - Mod.ML
