The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa has confirmed the diagnosis of cholera in a traveller returning from Zimbabwe. The patient developed abdominal cramps and diarrhea on 29 Sep 2018 (the day of her return to South Africa. She was admitted to a hospital in Tshwane (Gauteng province) on 1 Oct 2018, presenting with profuse watery diarrhea complicated by dehydration. Provincial and district health authorities responded swiftly, visiting the patient's household on 2 Oct 2018 to assess household contacts, conduct an environmental health assessment, and provide health information. Household surfaces were decontaminated and borehole and tap water samples collected for investigations. Household contacts are currently under surveillance. Cholera is typically transmitted through drinking water or food contaminated with cholera. However, cholera can also be transmitted following direct contact with infective material (such as stool or vomitus), and transmission within households is not uncommon. In this case, the risk for further spread in the community is negligible.

Further testing at NICD has confirmed that the isolate is a toxin-producing _Vibrio cholerae_ serotype Ogawa, and is multidrug resistant; it is resistant to most 1st-line antimicrobials including tetracycline, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin) but is susceptible to azithromycin. The mainstay of cholera treatment is fluid replacement; mild-to-moderate cases may be treated with oral rehydration fluid, but severe cases require hospitalisation and intravenous fluid administration. Antimicrobial treatment is recommended for patients with moderate to severe dehydration, as it reduces disease severity and the risk of further transmission; azithromycin is the antimicrobial of choice for this strain. The public are urged to drink water from safe water sources, ensure good hand hygiene before and after using the toilet, and before and after handling food. South African healthcare workers are advised to suspect cholera in any individual with acute onset of watery diarrhea.
