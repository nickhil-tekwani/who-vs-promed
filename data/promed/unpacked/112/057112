First Report of Pepper mottle virus in Tomato.
J. Th. J. Verhoeven, T. M. Willemen, and J. W. Roenhorst, Plant Protection
Service, Section Virology, P.O. Box 9102, 6700 HC Wageningen, the
Netherlands. Plant Dis. 86:186, 2002; published on-line as D-2001-1217-04N,
2001. Accepted for publication 3 Dec 2001.
In 2000, a breeding company submitted a tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_)
sample from Guatemala for diagnosis. The plants showed necrotic lesions on
leaves surrounded by some chlorosis, necrotic streaks on stems, and large
superficial necrotic lesions on fruits.
Mechanical inoculation of plant sap to different [indicator] plant species
[induced] symptoms ... in _Capsicum annuum_ 'Westlandse Grote Zoete',
_Lycopersicon esculentum_ 'Money-maker', [several _Nicotiana _ spp. and
_Physalis floridana_. ... Systemically infected leaves from _N.
occidentalis_-P1 were used for all further experiments.
Leaf dip preparations ... analyzed by [TEM] ... [showed] ... filamentous
virus particles typical of a potyvirus. [DAS-ELISA] ... tests for [several
potyviruses (A, V, Y, Tobacco etch and Wild potato mosaic) were negative
but] ... an antiserum (DSMZ As 0186) [to Pepper mottle potyvirus (PepMoV)]
...gave a positive reaction.
The nucleotide sequence of the complete 3´ nontranslated region (3NTR) and
the 3´ terminal part of the coat protein gene (3CPG) was determined using
... degenerate primers P9502/CPUP (1). The obtained nucleotide sequence
(approximately 700 bp) was deposited in GenBank under Accession No.
AF440801. It showed 93 to 94 percent 3NTR and 90 to 93 percent 3CPG
homolog[ies] with the 3 sequences of PepMoV from pepper already present in
GenBank.
Potato virus V and Potato virus Y [showed] up to 80 and 75 percent
homolog[ies] with the 3CPG and up to 53 and 48 percent homolog[ies] with
the 3NTR, respectively. [It was concluded] ... that the virus isolated from
the symptomatic tomato plants was PepMoV. Because of the relatively low
homologies with the pepper isolates of PepMoV, this tomato isolate [may] be
a separate strain of the virus.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of PepMoV in
tomato.

[Obviously there is no information on yield loss at this time. Do any of
our readers know anything about this virus disease in Guatamela? If so,
please let me know.
According to the VIDE data base, PepMoV was first reported in _Capsicum
annuum_ from Palm Beach County, Delray Beach, Florida, U.S.A. in 1972. Its
natural host range includes mottling and malformation of leaves (_C.
annuum_) and systemic mild mottle (_Solanaum_ spp.). The virus is
transmitted by several insect species (_Aphis gossypii_, _A. craccivora_
and _Myzus persicae_in a non-persistent manner. It is not transmitted by
contact between plants nor by seed. Its geographic range includes El
Salvador, India, and the USA (Florida, New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, and
California). PepMoV overwinters on weedy hosts such as silverleaf
nightshade (_Solanum elaeagnifolium_) and jimson weed (_Datura stramonium _).
Complete resistance to PepMoV is available in the pvr4 gene. Check out the
following paper in Genome 42(6):1111-1116 (1999): Development of a CAPS
marker for the Pvr4 locus: A tool for pyramiding potyvirus resistance genes
