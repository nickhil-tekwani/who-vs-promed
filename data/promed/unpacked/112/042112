Bovine tuberculosis, feline - UK
--------------------------------
Professor Danielle Gunn-Moore, who led the research team from Edinburgh University, said: "The potential incidence of feline mycobacteriosis is higher than previously thought. My biggest concern is this is spilling over from cattle and badgers into cats".

If bovine tuberculosis (TB) is turning up in cats, this is unlikely to be a new development, inasmuch as cats have inhabited dairy barns for centuries, and the numbers of British dairy barns, dairy cattle, and barn cats were all far higher several decades ago, before there were modern mega-dairies, before the milk output per milking cow approximately tripled from the norms of circa 1950, when both human and bovine TB were much more common, and before anyone was sterilizing either feral or pet cats.

Until relatively recently it was customary to give the 1st milk from cows' "freshening" to the barnyard cats and dogs, before the importance of saving colostrum was understood. Milk and cream offerings were commonly left for cats after every milking, to encourage them to stay in barns and hunt the rodents who infested every hayloft. Thus it is difficult to imagine that the cows carried any disease that could pass to cats but didn't.

Has anyone researched the incidence of bovine TB among cats before recent years?

[UK statistics of _Mycobacterium bovis_ in various species present the following data in relation to cats for the 15 years from 1997 to 2011 (respectively): 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 6, 13, 14, 15, 18, 26, 23, 18 (see at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130315143000/http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-landuselivestock-tb-other-otherspecies-121102.xls).

Regarding previous decades/husbandry methods/production systems: according to Van der Hoeden (Zoonoses, Elsevier Publishing Company 1964; Tuberculosis, p. 28, table V, "The percentage of incidence of tuberculosis among dogs and cats admitted to veterinary clinics"), the following data were presented:
Place / years / dogs / cats
Berlin / 1925 / 0.3 / 2
Paris / 1927 / 5.6 / 13.5
Stockholm / 1928-37 / 2.5 / 4.8
Utrecht / 1926-44 / 1.03 / 4.66
Amsterdam and Leiden / 1942-44 / 1.5 / 11
London / 1940 / 1 / 3.6
Liverpool / 1949 / 6.5 / 13

The recent recurrence of _M. bovis_ in UK's cats since 2004/5, as indicated by Defra's statistics and exhaustively analysed by Gunn-Moore et al, is indeed a cause for concern. - Mod.AS
