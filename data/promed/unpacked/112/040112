Genetic characterisation of the recent foot-and-mouth disease virus
subtype A/IRN/2005: Abstract (provisional)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Background
-------------
According to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, a new subtype of
FMDV serotype A was detected in Iran in 2005. This subtype was
designated A/IRN/2005, and rapidly spread throughout Iran and moved
westwards into Saudi Arabia and Turkey where it was initially
detected from August 2005 and subsequently caused major disease
problems in the spring of 2006. The same subtype reached Jordan in
2007. As part of an ongoing project we have also detected this
subtype in Pakistan with the 1st positive samples detected in April
2006. To characterise this subtype in detail, we have sequenced and
analysed the complete coding sequence of 3 subtype A/IRN/2005
isolates collected in Pakistan in 2006, the complete coding sequence
of one subtype A/IRN/2005 isolate collected during the 1st outbreak
in Turkey in 2005 and, in addition, the partial 1D coding sequence
derived from 4 epithelium samples and 34 swab-samples from Asian
buffaloes or cattle subsequently found to be infected with the
A/IRN/2005 subtype.

2. Results
------------
The phylogenies of the genome regions encoding for the structural
proteins displayed, with the exception of 1A, distinct,
serotype-specific clustering and an evolutionary relationship of the
A/IRN/2005 sublineage with the A22 sublineage. Potential
recombination events have been detected in parts of the genome region
coding for the non-structural proteins of FMDV. In addition, amino
acid substitutions have been detected in the deduced VP1 protein
sequence, potentially related to clinical or subclinical outcome of
FMD. Indications of differential susceptibility for developing a
subclinical course of disease between Asian buffaloes and cattle have
been detected. Furthermore, hitherto unknown insertions of 2 amino
acids before the 2nd start codon, as well as sublineage specific
amino acids have been detected in the genome region encoding for the
leader proteinase of A/IRN/2005 sublineage.

3. Conclusions
--------------------
Our findings indicate that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage has undergone 2
different paths of evolution for the structural and non-structural
genome regions. The structural genome regions have had their
evolutionary starting point in the A22 sublineage. It can be assumed
that, due to the quasispecies structure of FMDV populations and the
error-prone replication process, advantageous mutations in a changed
environment have been fixed and lead to the occurrence of the new
A/IRN/2005 sublineage. Together with this mechanism, recombination
within the non-structural genome regions, potentially modifying the
virulence of the virus, may be involved in the success of this new
sublineage. The possible origin of this recombinant virus may be a
co-infection with Asia1 and a serotype A precursor of the A/IRN/2005
sublineage potentially within Asian Buffaloes, as these appears to
relatively fairly become infected, but usually without developing
clinical disease and consequently showing not a strong acute
inflammatory immune response against a 2nd FMDV infection.

[This paper, currently available online as a pre-publication
abstract, was submitted to the Journal on 9 Oct 2007, accepted and
published (provisional abstract) on 15 Nov 2007. Fully formatted PDF
and HTML versions are in production. The authors are Joern Klein
(Denmark), Manzoor Hussain and Munir Ahmad (FAO, Pakistan), Preben
Normann (Denmark), Muhammad Afzal (Pakistan) and Soren Alexandersen
(Denmark, corresponding author).

The paper contributes to the understanding of the epidemiology of
FMDV subtype A/IRN/2005, currently spreading within the Middle East
and threatening Europe.

It further confirms the circulation of the said strain in Pakistan.
This should not surprise in view of Pakistan's shared borders with
Iran.

According to Pakistan's reports to the OIE, no outbreaks of FMD have
occurred there since 2005 and throughout 2007; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=disease_status_detail&selected_start_month=1&selected_start_year=2005&selected_end_month=12&selected_end_year=2007&date_submit=OK>.


While the absence of clinical cases in Asian Buffaloes (_Bubalus
bubalus_) may be related to the fact, discussed in the paper, that
their FMD infections may remain subclinical, infections in cattle,
and particularly dairy are expected to be clinically apparent and
demonstrable.

Furthermore, the Pakistan page on the website of the World Reference
laboratory for FMD (WRL FMD) includes details of more than 80 FMDV
strains (serotypes O, A and Asia1) sampled in Pakistan during the
years 2005 - 2007. Several of the 2006 isolates are designated
serotype A, on which the site says "FMDV isolates from this batch are
being sequenced at Lindholm, Denmark"; these are, probably, the
strains discussed in the above paper. See
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/pak.htm>.

Official reporting from Pakistan on the prevailing FMD situation may
be expected.

The authoritative views of the World reference laboratory for FMD at
Pirbright (WRL) and of the FAO European Commission for the Control of
FMD (EUFMD), in Rome, on vaccination against the Iranian FMDV subtype
A, can be read in posting 20070129.0380. - Mod.AS].

[The authors have reached the interesting conclusion that the origin
of the recombinant virus they have identified may be a consequence of
co-infection of susceptible animals (possibly Asian Buffaloes) with
Asia1 and a serotype A precursor of the A/IRN/2005 sublineage. These
recombinants retain infectivity but may not induce clinical disease
(in Asian buffalo at least) or induce an acute inflammatory immune
response against a second FMDV infection. Although some sequence
variation was evident in the structural protein region of the genomes
examined, recombination was not observed in this region of the genome
suggesting that these viruses retain the predominant antigenicity of
the A strain, and consequently an A-type vaccine might still have
some protective potential. - Mod.CP]
