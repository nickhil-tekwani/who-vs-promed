[1] Influenza, human: India WHO warning

WHO has said it is "carefully watching" the current swine flu outbreak in India. The toll in 2 months has crossed 1041, with cases breaching the 19 000 mark by Sat 28 Feb [2015].

Many parts of India including Mumbai are facing a shortage of laboratories for testing swine flu and isolation units. While the government has said that government hospitals are equipped for tests, in many cities people are being sent away to private labs charging a whopping Rs 5000 [USD 80] for the test.

A new strain of influenza virus responsible for 99.8 per cent of flu infections in the United States now could be responsible for some of the deaths in the recent swine flu outbreak in India, says a visiting scientist and director of the Atlanta Emory Vaccine Centre. The H3N2 virus is one of the 3 subtypes of swine flu, but labs in India are only looking for H1N1 strains. H2N2 is the other strain.

Dr Rafi Ahmed, who is leading an inter-governmental vaccine development programme of the Emory Centre and the New Delhi-based International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), called for studying the strains of the influenza virus in the current outbreak.

At least 20 deaths in Telangana could have been caused by other strains of swine flu, agree doctors. With similar symptoms to H1N1 infected cases, these patients who were sent home after showing negative results for H1N1 died within a few days.

A panic-driven rush for vaccines at drug stores is sending the stocks low. The trivalent influenza vaccine gives protection against H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B. The vaccine takes at least 2 weeks to develop immunity and provides about 60-80 per cent protection for about a year. Following consultations with experts, the Indian government has recommended vaccination only for health workers.

Meanwhile, the Indian health minister JP Nadda has urged the public not to panic, even as the number of deaths from swine flu crossed 900 in less than 2 months, while the number of infected cases stood at 16 000. Almost 51 deaths were reported in a single day.

Most of the deaths have been from complications arising from other diseases or disorders present in the patient. Patients have been coming into hospitals very late, further aggravating their condition, said a statement issued by the ministry. The drug oseltamivir remains effective for treatment, it said.

Virologists have recommended the use of N-95 face masks, which filter out over 95 per cent of small air droplets if worn correctly. But the masks should not be worn for more than 2 hours and need to be disposed of carefully. Washing hands thoroughly for a good 2 minutes using a soap solution has also been recommended as a way to reduce exposure risks.

35 fresh swine flu cases have been reported in the state of Telangana on a single day. According to the ministry, Rajasthan accounts for the highest number of deaths at 234, along with 4884 infections. Gujarat ranks 2nd at 231 deaths and 3527 infections. A rise in infections has been seen in Delhi, with 2571 cases.

The Ahmedabad district collector invoked the Criminal Procedure Code's Section 144 on Tue [24 Feb 2015], prohibiting mass gatherings without prior permission in a bid to check the spread of swine flu. Marriages and death processions have been exempted.

Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka and Punjab have reported some deaths too. The World Health Organization has said it was "carefully watching" the swine flu situation in India while ruling out signs of a large outbreak as yet. The outbreak is expected to subside as temperatures rise during the summer but will pick up when temperatures drop after the rains in July [2015].

[It appears that patients in India are being tested only for H1N1 and not the commoner seasonal influenza threat this season (2015), H3N2. ProMED-mail would welcome information on the influenza virus strains currently circulating in India.

Telangana is a state in the southern region of India with an area of 114 840 square km. It is the 12th largest state in India.
