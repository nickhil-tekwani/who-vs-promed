New Flare of FMD Discovered in SE Bulgaria
------------------------------------------
Over January and March 2011, Foot and mouth disease (FMD) was found
in sheep from various villages in the comparatively poor and sparsely
populated region.

Saturday [26 Mar 2011] it was announced that there are flares of the
disease in the villages of Goliamo Bukovo, Fakia and Momina Tsarkva
near the town of Sredets.

More than 350 animals in the 3 villages will have to be killed.

Poor SE Bulgaria Villagers to Protest FMD Measures
--------------------------------------------------
Villagers from Bulgaria's southeastern Strandzha region are calling a
protest Sunday [27 Mar 2011] against what appears to be the imminent
slaughter of some 7000 animals over fears of widespread FMD.

Saturday the latest flare of FMD was uncovered in the villages of
Goliamo Bukovo, Fakia and Momina Tsarkva near the town of Sredets.

Locals are calling a rally 9.30 am Saturday [26 Mar 2011] at the
veterinary unit near the village of Fakia. The villagers argue that
the massive killing of animals will leave them without one of their
central sources of livelihood.

They also fear that after what has happened people will not be
motivated to restore their herds and the already sparsely-populated
Strandzha region will be still further depopulated.

Locals further insisted that the state pay in full the reparations it
owes per killed animal. They also suggested an all-out vaccination
campaign to render an epidemic improbable.

[The alleged detection of FMD (clinical? positive serology?) in sheep
flocks within the affected area is in need of official confirmation or
otherwise. If confirmed, this may indicate continued circulation of
the virus and potential further spread within the susceptible,
unvaccinated population (large and small ruminants, swine).

FMD in sheep may, at times, be overlooked since the clinical signs
are less prominent than in cattle; in most cases, buccal lesions are
minimal or practically undetectable, the main clinical manifestation
being lameness and a short-lived temperature elevation. An important
disease sign is sudden mortality in neo-natals and days-to-weeks-old
offspring, in which typical cardiac lesions may be observed. Samples
for laboratory investigations are less easily obtainable; the most
suitable material for laboratory investigations in sheep is an
oesophagealÂ­pharyngeal (OP) sample, which can be collected by the
application of a probang cup. For details, refer to OIE's Manual at
<http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.05_FMD.pdf>
and to FAO's training manuals, such as
