Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Klosters, Klosters-Serneus, Prattigau/Davos, Graubunden
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Dec 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 21 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1
Affected population: The cow was slaughtered on 21 Dec 2020, and samples were taken for further analysis. Testing of animals in the holding of origin as well as in a 2nd holding, where the cow was kept within the last 6 weeks preceding the abortion, is ongoing. Both holdings have been placed under movement prohibition.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 5 / 0 / 0 / 5
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 9 Dec 2020, a 9 year old cow aborted, and blood samples were analysed in the frame of our routine screening program of abortions. The sample revealed a positive result for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) in the BoHV-1 ELISA on 11 Dec 2020. On 18 Dec 2020, the National Reference Laboratory, the Institute of Virology of the Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Zurich, confirmed the positive result by serum neutralisation test (SNT). At the moment, it is not possible to exclude BoHV-2 as the causative agent. In the frame of the epidemiological investigation, contacts with a number of holdings have been identified. As a preventive measure, these holdings have been placed under movement prohibition until either confirmation or exclusion of IBR as the causative agent.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institute of Virology of the Vetsuisse Faculty (VSF) (national laboratory) / cattle / seroneutralization test (SNT) / 18 Dec 2020 / positive

Future reporting
