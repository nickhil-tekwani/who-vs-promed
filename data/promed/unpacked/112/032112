I have read with interest the ProMED-mail posting concerning tuberculosis in
elephants. Do you have any information about tuberculosis in pets -
especially dogs? In Romania, tuberculosis is a prevalent disease in the
homeless, who usually bring a dog with them. This could be an interesting
field to study on.

[Considering the frequency that one sees homeless "street people" in the USA
and elsewhere with dogs, this is a wider question than just Romania. Does
anyone have any data on this hypothesis? We might widen it to domestic cats
and tubercular owners, in that cats are frequently held close to the face.
