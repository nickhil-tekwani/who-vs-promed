China: proposed ban on sale of civet cat meat in Guangdong
-----------------------------------------------
To prevent a winter return of the deadly SARS virus, a senior Chinese
health official will visit southern Guangdong province this month [October
2004] to map out measures such as banning civet cat from menus, a newspaper
said on Mon 18 Oct 2004. Initiatives to be hammered out by Vice Minister of
Health Wang Longde and provincial officials would include banning
restaurants from cooking and serving high-risk animals, such as civet cats,
Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po said.
Chinese health experts have concluded that the civet cat, considered a
delicacy in the south, was a primary source of last year's [2003] SARS
epidemic. Thousands of civets were killed in Guangdong province in January
[2004] because of fears they may carry a form of the virus that can jump to
humans. Guangdong would be the focus of Wang's move, and the measures for
civet cats there would not be extended to the whole country, the newspaper
said.
The civet is a small carnivorous mammal found in Asia and Africa. The brown
furry creature with a cat-like body, long tail, and weasel-like face has
long been coveted by those who believe its tender flesh will improve their
health and complexion. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) emerged in
Guangdong in November 2002 and was soon spread by travelers. The disease
eventually killed some 800 people around the world and infected about 8000.
A top Chinese health official warned, on Sat 16 Oct 2004, of the increased
risk of infectious diseases, such as SARS and avian influenza, jumping
across the border to Hong Kong in 2005, as more Chinese travel to the
southern city for work and play. Speaking after a 2-day meeting with health
officials from Hong Kong and Macau, Chinese Vice Minister for Health Huang
Jiefu stressed the need for surveillance and information sharing to control
the spread of infectious diseases.

[Civet cats and some other animals are undoubtedly susceptible to SARS
coronavirus infection, but the role of civet cats in the epidemiology of
the human disease of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) remains
unclear. Even assuming that civet cats were the source of the outbreak of
SARS beginning in South China in 2002/2003, banning the consumption of
civet cat meat in Guangdong province only can have limited success. These
animals are widespread in the wild and in captivity, hence contact between
humans and civet cats could occur anywhere in China and beyond.
Coronaviruses are spread mainly by respiratory routes, and cooked meat
would not be infectious. Banning of civet cat farming might be a more
effective measure. - Mod.CP]
