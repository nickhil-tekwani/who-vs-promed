Foot and mouth disease has been discovered in a goat herd in Moshav Netu'a
in Western Galilee. The disease is suspected to have spread into an
additional herd in Moshav Zarit. Following the detection of the disease,
the veterinary services have imposed quarantine upon the affected herd and
began vaccinations of the goats. Samples have been sent for laboratory
investigation at the veterinary institute.

What is new? (3 Jan 2007): Outbreak of FMD, Netu'a
--------------------------------------------------
Foot and Mouth Disease was detected in a herd of goats in late December
2006. The herd in Netu'a (Lebanon border) is a mixed breed (Saanen X
Mamber) milk herd which contains 280 mothers, 20 males and 220 kids. Ninety
of the kids died suddenly in this outbreak without any other clinical
signs. About 60 percent of the mothers show slight clinical symptoms
(superficial ulcers on the mammary gland). "Tiger hearts" have been seen in
the kids' post mortem [a grayish or yellowish streaking in the myocardium
indicating degeneration and necrosis; see
<http://www.vet.uga.edu/vpp/gray_book02/fad/fmd.php>].
See Immediate Notification Report to the OIE.

[For the location of Netu'a and Zarit see square 2 in the interactive map
at <http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html>. Zarit, where a 2nd
outbreak of the FMDV serotype O has reportedly been suspected, is situated
about 5 km northwest of Netu'a, and similarly on the Lebanese frontier.
Laboratory results of samples from Zarit are anticipated.
It will be of interest to obtain information on the current FMD situation
in Lebanon and in neighbouring Syria. - Mod.AS]
