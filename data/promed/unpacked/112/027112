Three cases of _E. coli_ infection since September 2014 have prompted the Clackamas County Health Department to begin testing all children and staff at a West Linn Montessori program for the potentially deadly bacteria.

In a Thursday (30 Oct 2014) letter to parents with children at Heart Centered Montessori, the department said it continues to investigate the source of the infections. Meanwhile, health officials recommended students and employees be tested for _E. coli_ and to avoid returning to school, swimming, and participating in group activities until test results are back.

The Montessori school serves children up to age 6 and was established in 2007, according to its website.

At least 2 of the 3 infections are of the most virulent type of _E. coli_, O157.H7, the letter to families said. A 4-year-old girl in Lincoln County died of the same bacterial strain in September 2014.

Clackamas County officials declined to provide further details about who was infected or their medical status. Officials at the school could not be reached.

"People often recover, but before they recover, then can be very ill and be hospitalized," said Jonathan Modie, a spokesperson for the Oregon Health Authority. Children can still carry the bacteria even if they don't show symptoms or only feel a little bit sick, the department wrote in a letter to parents of children attending the preschool.

[Montessori education (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education) is an educational approach developed by Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori and characterized by an emphasis on independence, freedom within limits, and respect for a child's natural psychological, physical, and social development.

At this point, it is not reported whether the 3 EHEC isolates are genetically related besides being acquired in the same school, although not necessarily in the same classroom. It is also important to know what the timeline of onset of illness was in the 3 cases and what potential contact there was between the cases, either directly or by eating the same foods. The incubation period of EHEC can be up to 10 days, longer than most other bacterial enteric pathogens, so the cases, even if related, could have occurred over as long as 20 days. - Mod.LL
