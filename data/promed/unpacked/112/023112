Bangladesh: US Experts Identify Virus of "Mysterious Disease" in Tangail
---------------------------------------------------
Medical experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta, USA, have identified the "mysterious disease" that has already
taken several lives in Tangail, an official handout said here yesterday
(Mon 24 Jan 2005). CDC experts found Nipah virus in the blood of patients.
The disease, which has claimed some lives in the district, created a panic
among the [local population].
Nipah virus is [named after] a place in Malaysia. According to medical
experts, Nipah virus is carried by bats. Anybody eating fruit contaminated
by bat excreta or in contact with bat excreta could contract Nipah virus
infection.
The handout said that after receiving notification of the death of one
person in Tangail, a medical team of experts from Institute of
Epidemiological Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) under the Health
Directorate rushed to the area to investigate on 11 Jan 2005. Later, on 16
Jan 2005, the Director General of Health Services visited the affected
area. The medical teams formed by the Tangail Civil Surgeon are also
working round-the-clock in the affected area.
The IEDCR experts have sent samples of blood, urine, [sputum] and CSF
(cerebrospinal fluid) to the CDC in Atlanta for further investigation. The
CDC experts disclosed their findings on 20 Jan 2005, saying that Nipah
virus was found in the blood samples. The handout said [urgent] steps have
been taken to [contain] the disease. The Tangail medical team and IEDCR
experts will continue their work.

Bangladesh: Virus Killing 5 Confirmed to be Nipah Virus
--------------------------------------------------
5 deaths in central Bangladesh have been confirmed to be caused by Nipah
virus, as more than 20 other patients have been reported to be suffering
from the viral infection since 5 Jan 2005. A release by the Directorate
General of Health Services (DGHS) on Tue 25 Jan 2005 confirmed the outbreak
of Nipah virus in the northern district of Tangail, adjacent to Dhaka.
According to the release, the health department one week ago sent the
samples of blood, human tissue, and urine from the infected patients to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA, USA. The
CDC on 20 Jan 2005 sent the results that show some samples are Nipah
virus-positive.
So far there have been 12 deaths from the infection in January with
flu-like symptoms including high fever and muscle pains, while many
villagers in the district have begun to flee their homes in panic. The DGHS
in the wake of the CDC report has taken immediate measures to further
investigate the mode of transmission and epidemiology of the virus.
Nipah virus draws its name from a Malaysian village where it was first
detected in 1999. The virus causes disease in animals and then in humans
through contact with infected animals. In a large outbreak of encephalitis
in Malaysia in 1999, the investigation identified Nipah virus as the causal
agent, and 105 out of 265 infected people died. The virus was also detected
in Bangladesh in January-February 2004, killing 18 people, mostly children.
According to World Health Organization data, no drug therapies have yet
been proven effective in treating Nipah virus infection. Treatment relies
on intensive supportive care. There is some evidence that early treatment
with the antiviral drug [ribavirin?] can reduce both the duration of fever
and the severity of disease. The efficacy of this treatment in curing the
disease or improving survival, however, is still uncertain.

Bangladesh: Rapid Response Teams to Prevent Spread of Nipha Virus
--------------------------------------------------
The government has appointed 'rapid response teams' in every district to
detect and prevent spread of Nipah virus infection About 11 people died due
to Nipah virus infection in the Tangail district during the past few days.
Earlier in 2004 about 24 people died [in an outbreak of Nipah virus
infection] in the Faridpur district. Experts say if the virus spreads man
to man, the attack may take epidemic proportions.
Director of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR) Mahmudur Rahman said, "We are working to prepare a set of
guidelines for people to prevent infection by the virus. We are going to
investigate the source of the virus. If we can detect the source it will be
very easy to prevent the disease," he said.
Quoting researchers from Atlanta [CDC], he also said the virus is spread by
bats. The virus can also spread from human to human, he added, [citing a]
BBC report.

Bangladesh: Tangail Deaths Caused by Nipah Virus
------------------------------------------------
Medical experts yesterday confirmed an outbreak of Nipah virus infection in
3 villages in Tangail, where 5 people died and 25 more were reported
suffering from viral infection since 5 Jan 2005.
The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) in a press release
yesterday confirmed the Nipah outbreak. It said samples of blood and tissue
from sick patients had been sent to the Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, GA, USA. The CDC on 20 Jan 2005 conveyed the
test report that shows one patient is Nipah virus-positive.
[Nipah virus] transmission from animal to human requires close contact with
contaminated tissue or body fluids from infected animals. The DGHS, in the
wake of the CDC report, has taken immediate measures to further investigate
the mode of transmission and epidemiology of the virus. It is also
collecting more samples to analyse suspected illness among other
neighbouring inhabitants in the affected villages in Habla union in Basail.
"We're very alarmed by the result and now have no doubts that the 'unknown'
viral attack in Tangail is a Nipah virus outbreak," said Prof Mahmudur
Rahman, director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR).
"The high mortality rate is more alarming in Bangladesh if we consider the
Nipah virus outbreaks in Goalanda in Faridpur and Meherpur a few of years
back," he added. The rate in Malaysia, where the virus was discovered or
suspected to have originated, was 39 percent, whereas in Faridpur it was 73
percent.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nipah virus was
discovered in 1999. It causes disease in animals and then in humans through
contact with infected animals. Certain species of fruit bats are currently
believed to have been the hosts of the virus. Antibodies to the virus have
been detected in pigs and other domestic and wild animals, according to the
WHO. However, the role of species other than pigs in transmitting Nipah
virus has not yet been determined. It is unlikely that the virus is easily
transmitted to man, although previous outbreak reports suggest Nipah virus
is transmitted from animals to humans more readily.
Despite frequent contact between fruit bats and humans, there is no
serological evidence of human infection from bat carriers. Pigs were the
apparent source of infection among most human cases in the Malaysian
outbreak, but other sources such as infected dogs and cats cannot be ruled
out, said a WHO release, which also said the incubation period of the virus
is between 4 and 18 days. In many cases the infection is mild or not
apparent (sub-clinical). In symptomatic cases, the onset is usually with
'influenza-like' symptoms, with high fever and muscle pains. The disease
may progress to inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) with drowsiness,
disorientation, convulsions, and coma. 50 percent of clinically apparent
cases die.
Between September 1998 and April 1999, there was a large outbreak of
encephalitis in Malaysia. During investigation, Nipah virus, a previously
unrecognised virus, was identified as the causal agent. As many as 265
people were infected and 105 of them died.
