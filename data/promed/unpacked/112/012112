[The information in this follow-up notification is more detailed than the
information provided in the previous, initial notification on PRRS in
China, dated 9 May 2007, which pertained to a single outbreak (in the
village Laosi, district Yuncheng, province Guangdong). The current
notification provides the names of 17 affected provinces, and partial data
on the scope of the disease: no number of affected holdings and villages,
and on their geographical locations.
While the reason for reporting is indicated as "change of epidemiology",
explained as "increased pathogenicity", and the reported apparent case
fatality rate exceeds 27 per cent, the manifestation of the disease is
described as "sub-clinical infection". This discrepancy is in need of
clarification.
In the previous ProMED-mail posting (archived 20070801.2486), we explained
why the Chinese porcine epizootic, reportedly spreading since mid 2006, was
titled "undiagnosed" while a Viet Nam porcine epizootic with similarities,
is titled PRRS (porcine reproductive & respiratory syndrome). The
commendable improvement of China's reporting will allow ProMED-mail to
relate to the Chinese porcine epizootic as a preliminarily diagnosed
disease entity, PRRS.
Complementary information, particularly pertaining to the missing data
mentioned above, would help. - Mod.AS]
