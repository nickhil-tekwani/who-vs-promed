From: Mike Cole <Michael.Cole@affa.gov.au>

Tests have proved negative for potato ring rot on suspect potatoes from
Tasmania. Property quarantine bans have been lifted. No other specific
causal agent was found for the internal tissue breakdown of the suspect
potatoes but it is thought it could be a combination of post harvest factors.
Suspect potatoes did not show strong symptoms for bacterial ring rot but
Western Australian Agriculture officials thought it prudent for further
investigation at the time upon the initial sighting of suspect potatoes
exhibiting internal tissue breakdown.
A press release can be seen in the September 4 Edition of The Examiner
newspaper from Launceston, Tasmania.

[It is gratifying to know that good scientific research led to a definitive
answer. Plant protection personnel in Tasmania and Queensland no doubt are
relieved. However, continued vigilance is warranted. -Mod.DH
