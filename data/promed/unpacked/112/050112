A child in the USA is thought to be part of an _E. coli_ outbreak linked to a farm in Iceland that has affected 21 people. A spokeswoman from Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) told Food Safety News it was aware of one case that is potentially linked to the outbreak in Iceland. "The person is a Maine resident who had diarrheal illness after travel to the tourist attraction in Iceland that has been linked to the outbreak. Maine CDC is investigating this case," said the spokeswoman.

Brittany Behm, from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said once the agency receives genetic data about the _E. coli_ outbreak strain it will monitor the PulseNet database to see if there are additional cases in the country.

A Shiga toxin-producing enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) O26: H11 outbreak has been linked to the tourist attraction Efstidalur II farm in Blaskogabyggd in the south of the country. There are 19 ill children aged between 5 months and 12 years old and 6 developed hemolytic uremic syndromes (HUS), a severe condition associated with _E. coli_ infections that causes kidney failure. One child needed peritoneal dialysis. Dates of illness onset are from 13 Jun 2019 to 10 Jul 2019. 7 are girls and 12 are boys but there is no connection between them.

The strongest epidemiological link is with consumption of ice cream but half of the children also petted calves. 2 adults are also part of the outbreak. One of these works at the farm and has been asymptomatic but did not work with food. The other person is a tourist thought to be from Sweden who came to Iceland on 5 Jul 2019. They visited [Efstidalur] on 8 Jul 2019 and fell ill on 11 Jul 2019. The patient consumed food, including ice cream, but did not report animal contact.

Previously, officials from the Directorate of Health urged anyone who visited the farm between 10 Jun 2019 and 4 Jul 2019, and developed diarrhea within 10 days, to contact a doctor and be tested for the bacterium. However, as the latest case has an illness onset date after 4 Jul 2019, the Directorate of Health reported measures put in place from that date had not stopped the risk of infection. General cleaning and disinfection have since taken place in the restaurant and adjacent rooms.

Bjorgvin Johannesson, one of the owners of the business which is run by 4 families, previously told Food Safety News ice cream production and contact with calves had been stopped while investigations continue into the incident. Testing of ice cream did not find the outbreak strain but samples were not from the same batch as the children had eaten. The _E. coli_ serotype that infected the children was detected in feces from calves.

[The scope of this EHEC outbreak has reached the USA in a tourist. It may be the case that some of those infected acquired the pathogen from locally made ice cream (?unpasteurized milk related) and others from direct or indirect livestock contact. - Mod.LL
