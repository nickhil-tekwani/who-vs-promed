Germany: 3rd Rabies Infected Transplant Patient Dies
---------------------------------------------------
A German who received a kidney and a pancreas from a woman infected with
rabies virus has died of the disease, doctors said today. The 45-year-old
man was the 3rd donor recipient to be killed by the disease after receiving
the infected organs earlier this year, despite treatment with the newest
rabies therapies, said Hans Deucker, spokesman for the University Clinic in
Marburg.
Last month [March 2005] a 70-year-old man who received the donor's other
kidney died, along with a 3rd patient who received a lung from the woman.
The 26-year-old donor showed no symptoms of rabies at the time of her
death, health officials have said. How she may have contracted rabies
remains unclear, but officials say she visited India in October 2004.
Although rare in developed countries, rabies kills thousands of people each
year in developing nations. Most human cases arise from dog bites, though
many animals can carry the disease.
Last May [2004], 4 people in the southern US died of rabies after receiving
infected lungs, kidneys and liver of a donor in the state of Arkansas who
carried the disease.

[Previously, the thread describing this occurrence with ensuing discussion
was cut on 25 Feb 2005. The above report records the unfortunate death of
the 3rd of the 3 recipients of organs from the rabies virus-infected donor,
and brings final closure to this incident. The pre-symptomatic rabies
virus-infected donor is thought to have contracted rabies virus infection
during a visit to India. - Mod.CP]
