Portales, [New Mexico] is at the center of another national salmonella outbreak after state health officials said on Mon 19 Aug 2013 that a Portales hatchery was linked to a strain of _Salmonella_ that has sickened hundreds across the country.

The Department of Health said the strain of _S._ Typhimurium that has infected more than 300 people in 37 states was found in a duck pen at Privett Hatchery on East Spruce in Portales, according to the department's press release. 19 of those cases were reported in New Mexico.

The investigation has linked this outbreak to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live baby poultry purchased from multiple feed stores. Privett Hatchery supplies baby chicks, ducklings and other live baby poultry to feed stores and mail order customers nationwide. The owner of Privett Hatchery was not available for comment, but the hatchery issued a statement on its website.

"Privett Hatchery, Inc. shares the concerns of the public in regard to recent reports of illnesses. We are working with authorities at the New Mexico Department of Agriculture and CDC as they continue their investigation into salmonella outbreaks, some of which may be linked to our hatchery," the statement said. "Our top priority is providing safe, healthy poultry to our customers. We will continue to work with our suppliers to ensure we can do so."

The press release said 60 percent of the cases are children aged 10 or younger, and no deaths have been reported, but at least 51 people have been hospitalized.

According to the hatchery's statement, expanded biosecurity precautions and ongoing counsel from an outside expert are included in its focus on disease prevention and the reduction of risks of salmonella in its flocks. "As always, we will focus on our responsibility to educate consumers on proper care and handling of the birds," the statement said.

State Public Health Veterinarian Paul Ettestad says the hatchery is most likely the source of the outbreak. But he says questions remain because federal officials have found that the people sickened with salmonellosis bought baby poultry at 113 feed store locations that were supplied by 18 mail order hatcheries in several states.

This is the 2nd national salmonella outbreak connected to a Portales-based company within a year. Sunland Inc., the nation's largest organic peanut butter processor, had its products linked to a salmonellosis outbreak that sickened 41 people in 20 states last fall [2012]. The company temporarily shut down its factory, revamped its sanitation process, and completed test production runs in April 2013 to reopen its plant.

[Outbreaks of salmonellosis continue to occur related to contact with live poultry, particularly chicks and ducklings. Similar to the use of rational kitchen hygiene, aggressive hand washing after contact with live fowl is vital in preventing infection. - Mod.LL
