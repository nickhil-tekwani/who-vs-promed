MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION BY MOSQUITOES
======================================
I have been intrigued for many years by speculation about Hepatitis B, HIV
and other viruses being transmitted "mechanically" by mosquitoes whose blood
meals have been interrupted. Has anyone ever looked at mosquito probosces
after feeding for traces of human blood? Mosquitoes are not pool feeders,
but insert their complex "mouthparts" by protruding them directly from
proboscis sheaths, through avascular host epidermis and into dermal
capillaries. On withdrawal, the reverse occurs, so it is extremely unlikely
that any blood would remain on the outside. Further, there is also a
considerable flow of mosquito saliva during feeding, which might wash out
the proboscis feeding channel after withdrawal. This is quite distinct from
the more messy feeding mechanisms of tabanids, stable fies, tsetses,
phlebotomines, simuliids, ceratopogonids etc., which, at least
theoretically, are more likely to be mechanical transmitters.
I look forward to responses.
