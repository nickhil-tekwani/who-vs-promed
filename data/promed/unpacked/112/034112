News of the response
Head of State visit to Beni
---------------------------
On Tue 16 Apr 2019, the President of the Republic, Felix Tshisekedi, visited the response teams during his trip to Beni. He visited the Ebola treatment center where he witnessed the release of a cured patient to whom he gave the clearance certificate. He spoke at length with various agents of the team who explained the functioning of the response, including patient care and mobile laboratories of the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB). He commended the health workers for their work in keeping the epidemic [confined to] only 2 provinces of the country, without reaching neighboring countries, and provided them with state support. In addition, he called on the population to work with the response teams and to respect preventive measures to quickly put an end the Ebola outbreak.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 101 249 people have been vaccinated [total numbers of people vaccinated in North Kivu, Ituri, Tshopo, and Haut-Uele provinces can be seen at the source URL above].

Weekly summary of epidemiological data
--------------------------------------
Week 15 (8-14 Apr 2019)
----------------------
- 7297 new alerts notified
There has been a clear increase in the number of alerts received over the last 5 weeks.
The vast majority of these alerts come from the community and health facilities. This indicates better community collaboration with the response teams. There has also been a decrease in violence against teams, including in areas of Katwa, Butembo, and Vuhovi, which until now have been difficult for health workers to access.
- 1933 suspected cases investigated and tested in the laboratory
- 110 new confirmed cases: Katwa is the main focus with 60 cases (54.5%).
A health zone has been removed from the list of zones that have notified at least one confirmed case in the last 21 days: Kayna [North Kivu]. A health zone is back in the list: Komanda [Ituri].
- As the graph [at the source URL] shows, the number of new confirmed cases notified weekly has increased significantly in the last 5 weeks as a result of targeted attacks against Katwa and Butembo ETCs.
- 83 deaths of confirmed cases: the main source of deaths is Katwa with 51 deaths, or 62.4% of the total number of new deaths during the week;
Of the 83 deaths, 49 were community deaths (59%) and 34 occurred in an ETC.
-24 new people cured: the number of recoveries discharged from ETCs each week continues to increase. We went from 19 new recoveries at week 14 to 24 new cures at week 15.

Good news that there is at least a temporary cessation of violence, allowing case contacts to be traced and vaccinations to be administered. The cessation of these efforts is what led to the current increase in case numbers. - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 14 Apr 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 1264, of which 1198 confirmed and 66 probable. In total, there were 814 deaths (748 confirmed and 66 probable) and 374 people cured;
- 231 suspected cases under investigation;
- 13 new confirmed cases, including 7 in Katwa, 2 in Mabalako, 1 in Mandima, 1 in Musienene, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Oicha;
- 11 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 6 community deaths -- 4 in Katwa and 2 in Mabalako; 5 deaths at ETCs -- 3 in Katwa and 2 in Butembo;
- 3 new recoveries, including 1 release from the Butembo ETC, 1 from the Beni ETC, and 1 from the Mabalako ETC;
- One Katwa health worker is among the new confirmed cases (community deaths). This is an unvaccinated nurse who was in contact with a confirmed patient. When she became ill, she hid and was cared for at home by her colleagues, from 4-13 Apr 2019. Following the deterioration of her clinical condition, she consulted a health center in Butembo where she died.
- The cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 89 (7% of all confirmed/probable cases) including 32 deaths.

News of the response
More than 100 000 vaccinated people
-----------------------------------
- This Sun 14 Apr 2019, the cap of 100 000 people vaccinated against Ebola in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri has been reached. Of these 100 000, 27 766 are front-line health workers, 26 328 are high-risk contacts for confirmed cases, and 46 376 are contacts.

- So far, the only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, after the approval of the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018. The strategy used, called [ring] vaccination, aims to create a circle of people immunized against the Ebola virus around a confirmed patient in order to break the chain of transmission.

- Preliminary results from a study by the National Institute for Biomedical Research (INRB) and the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the very high [efficacy] of the vaccine and vaccination belt to limit the spread of Ebola outbreak. Moreover, the significant increase in new cases confirmed in recent weeks, particularly in active households in Butembo and Katwa, is partly explained by the temporary cessation of vaccination activities in March following the rise in violence against the teams of the response. Because of the problems of violence and safety, 45 vaccination rings could not be opened around confirmed cases.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 100 470 people have been vaccinated.

#Ebola: [plus] 11 cases today & [plus] 11 deaths. Most of the activity is at Katwa-Butembo-Vuhovi, which are the areas that are fueling the outbreak at this point. 6 of the deaths are community deaths, which remains a huge problem. The outbreak totals are now 1251 cases & 803 deaths.

2. There is a little good news in today's @MinSanteRDC #Ebola update. The number of vaccine doses used rose by 812 from yesterday [15 Apr 2019]. That's a massive 1-day change & hopefully a sign more people are agreeing to be vaccinated. In total nearly 100 000 people have been vaccinated.]

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Mon 15 Apr 2019. Ebola cases climb by 44 as vaccine trial affirms high efficacy
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/04/ebola-cases-climb-44-vaccine-trial-affirms-high-efficacy
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

The pace of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak showed no sign of slowing over the weekend [13-14 Apr 2019], with another 20-case day, but with some good preliminary news about the efficacy of the vaccine, which officials hope to parlay into their pitches for community members to be vaccinated.

And in new developments today [15 Apr 2019], the country's health ministry reported 13 new cases and said the number of people vaccinated topped the 100 000 mark.

In its daily updates the DRC's health ministry reported 20 cases on [13 Apr 2019], 11 cases yesterday [14 Apr 2019], and 13 cases today [15 Apr 2019]. All are from the current hot spots, with Katwa by far the hardest hit, with 30 infections. The other cases were reported in Mandima (4), Beni (2), Vuhovi (2), Butembo (2), Mabalako (2), Musienene (1), and Oicha (1). Health officials are still investigating 231 suspected cases.

The gush of new infections pushes the DRC's Ebola total to 1264 cases, 1198 of them confirmed and 66 listed as probable.

The death toll from the disease also shot higher, with 42 more fatalities reported, including a stillborn baby in Beni whose mother died at the Ebola treatment center.

Also, one of the people who died is a health worker in Katwa, an unvaccinated nurse who had contact with a confirmed patient and hid at home when her symptoms began where she received care from her coworkers. Her infection lifts the number of infected health workers to 89, including 32 deaths.

Of the latest fatalities, 24 people died from their infections in the community and 18 died at Ebola treatment centers. The total deaths in outbreak have now topped 800, reaching 814.

The health ministry also shared new details in light of pushing past the 100 000 vaccination mark, noting that 27 766 of those immunized are frontline health workers, 26 328 are high-risk contacts of confirmed cases, and 46 376 are contacts.

Officials also said the surge in new cases in Butembo and Katwa is partly explained by the temporary pause in vaccination activities surrounding March violence against the treatment center. The vaccination hiatus prevented 45 vaccination rings from opening around confirmed cases.

Powerful vaccine impact, 97.5% efficacy
---------------------------------------
The DRC's health ministry on [Sat 13 May 2019] said preliminary results from the clinical trial under way alongside the ring vaccination in the outbreak region confirm earlier high efficacy observations seen in Guinea's outbreak in 2015. (See ProMED-mail Ebola update (37): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, WHO, vaccine 20190414.6421230).

Take-home messages from the findings are that evidence is increasing on the efficacy of the vaccine and that even those who may have already been exposed to the virus at the time of vaccination may have greater chances of survival. "This is a particularly important finding if we consider that there are no licensed treatments for Ebola, although investigational therapeutics are being used," the group wrote.

Situation update
----------------
This past week saw the continued rise in the number of Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a total of 110 new confirmed cases. Documented transmission, however, remains geographically confined, with the majority of recent cases reported from the health zones of Katwa, Mandima, Butembo, and Vuhovi. During the last 21 days (25 Mar-14 Apr 2019), 55 health areas within 11 health zones reported new cases; 38% of the 144 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2 -- available at the source URL above). During this period, a total of 238 confirmed and probable cases were reported from Katwa (119), Vuhovi (41), Mandima (27), Beni (20), Butembo (14), Oicha (7), Mabalako (5), Kalunguta (1), Masereka (1), Musienene (1), and Lubero (1).

As of 14 Apr 2019, a total of 1264 EVD cases, including 1198 confirmed and 66 probable cases, were reported. A total of 814 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 64%), including 748 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 1264 confirmed and probable cases with reported age and sex, 56% (712) were female, and 28% (355) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 89, including 32 deaths, with four new health workers confirmed in the last week; all from community health centres within hotspot areas.

On 12 Apr 2019, the WHO Director-General convened the International Health Regulation (IHR) Emergency Committee on the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The IHR Emergency Committee commended the efforts of frontline responders from the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, WHO, and partners to contain the outbreak in a complex and difficult setting. However, they expressed deep concern about the recent increase in transmission in specific areas and the potential risk of spread to neighbouring countries. The Emergency Committee also provided public health advice to accelerate case detection and contact follow up, to prevent nosocomial transmission and shorten the time between onset of disease and access to high standards of care and therapeutics, strengthen and broaden community acceptance, accelerate preparedness in neighbouring countries including vaccination of health care workers and front-line workers, and strengthen cross border collaboration, including mapping of population movements and understanding social networks.

At this time, the Emergency Committee does not believe that the ongoing Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

After the worst-ever week of new infections in one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history, there is growing concern that the Canadian-developed Ebola vaccine is still mistrusted by many of the most vulnerable people in the crisis zone.

More than 100 new cases of Ebola have been detected over the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, by far the largest number of weekly cases since the beginning of the outbreak last year [2018]. In total, more than 1250 people have been infected and more than 800 have died so far, making it the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history.

New data show that the experimental Ebola vaccine, developed at Winnipeg's microbiology laboratory, has been remarkably effective in preventing the virus. About 100 000 doses of the vaccine have been administered in the latest outbreak, and it has had a 97.5-per-cent protection rate among those who took it, the data released by the World Health Organization show.

But a "huge portion" of the Ebola infections are among those who refuse to take the vaccine, and nearly 10 per cent of those who could be exposed to the virus are refusing to take the vaccine, according to Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program.

"There have been, tragically, some refusals among even health workers to be vaccinated," Dr Ryan told a media briefing on [12 Apr 2019] in Geneva. "We have to get the message to communities that this vaccine is highly effective."

There is mounting concern that health workers and government officials have been unable to dispel the suspicion and fear among communities where Ebola is spreading, in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces of eastern Congo.

Because of mistrust of the medical system and the government, many people are refusing to seek treatment when they become ill, and many die without any treatment, which can further spread the virus. Over the past week, about 40 per cent of newly detected cases were among people who died in their communities before their virus was detected.

The mistrust is largely because of a decades-long history of neglect, poverty, armed conflict, and traumatization in the region. More than 20 armed groups are active in the 2 provinces. Much of the region was excluded from Congo's election in December because of the Ebola outbreak, adding to the sense of alienation and resentment. 5 Ebola treatment centres in the region have been attacked and damaged, and many health workers have been assaulted. Police and soldiers have been deployed to protect health workers or to compel people to comply with health measures, causing more mistrust and pushing some people into hiding when they become ill.

A survey in the region, published in the medical journal Lancet, found that nearly half of respondents believed that Ebola didn't exist or was invented to destabilize the region or to make money. People with those beliefs were far less likely to seek Ebola treatment. And about one-third of all respondents were unwilling to take the Ebola vaccine.

"More than 8 months into the outbreak, the situation is alarming," said a statement by Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). "It is clear that the outbreak is not under control."

MSF is calling for urgent changes. The Ebola response should be integrated into local health centres, allowing people to choose health care in their own communities, instead of requiring them to travel to a formal Ebola treatment centre, MSF said.

- Mon 1 Apr 2019. West Africa study
ref: Timothy JWS, Hall Y, Akoi-Bore J, et al. Early transmission and case fatality of Ebola virus at the index site of the 2013-16 west African Ebola outbreak: a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey. Lancet Infect Dis 2019; 19(4): 429438. doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30791-6; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309918307916?via%3Dihub [abridged, edited]

Summary
-------
Background. To date, epidemiological studies at the site of the 2013-16 west African Ebola outbreak in Meliandou, Guinea, have been restricted in their scope. We aimed to determine the occurrence of previously undocumented Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases and infections, and to reconstruct transmission events.

Findings. In addition to the 11 EVD deaths described previously, on the basis of clinical description and oral fluid testing, we found 2 probable EVD deaths and 8 previously unrecognised anti-Ebola virus IgG-positive survivors.

Interpretation. Ebola virus infection was more widespread in this spillover population than previously recognised (21 vs 11 cases). We show the first serological evidence of survivors in this population (eight anti-Ebola virus IgG seropositive) and report a case fatality lower than previously reported (55·6% vs 100% in adults). These data show the high community coverage achievable by using a non-invasive test and, by accurately documenting the beginnings of the west African Ebola virus outbreak, reveal important insight into transmission dynamics and risk factors that underpin Ebola virus spillover events.

ref: Richardson ET, Fallah MP. The genesis of the Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa. Lancet Infect Dis. 2019; 19(4): 348-9. doi:10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30055-6; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30055-6/fulltext [abridged, edited]

The 2013-16 Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa was purported to have begun in the Guinean village of Meliandou in December, 2013. Authorities recorded 11 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) at this "index site" (where the virus is believed to have first spilled over into the human population), with 100% case fatality. In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, JWS Timothy and colleagues present a brilliant piece of epidemiological sleuthing. By combining classic field investigations with an assay that can measure Ebola virus antibodies in oral fluid, the authors have improved our understanding of the early development of the outbreak in Meliandou. They show that there was almost double the number of individuals infected with Ebola virus (21 cases vs the 11 cases previously reported), and the case fatality was 55.66%.

Timothy and colleagues corroborate emerging evidence that suggest minimally symptomatic infections were common in the 2013-16 outbreak in west Africa and that a substantial portion of Ebola transmission events might have been undetected during the outbreak. Indeed, even WHO has admitted that the true toll of the epidemic "was certainly greater" than the 28 616 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of EVD that were reported.

Summary
-------
Background. The 2018 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur province, Democratic Republic of the Congo, began on [8 May 2018], and was declared over on [24 Jul 2018]; it resulted in 54 documented cases and 33 deaths. We did a retrospective genomic characterisation of the outbreak and assessed potential therapeutic agents and vaccine (medical countermeasures).

Findings. A targeted sequencing approach produced 16 near-complete genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of these genomes and 1011 genomes from GenBank revealed a distinct cluster, confirming a new Ebola virus variant, for which we propose the name "Tumba". This new variant appears to have evolved at a slower rate than other Ebola virus variants (0.69x10^-3 substitutions per site per year with "Tumba" vs 1.06x10^-3 substitutions per site per year without "Tumba"). We found few sequence mismatches in the assessed assay target regions and antigenic sites. We identified nine amino acid changes in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein, of which one resulted in reduced binding of the 13C6 antibody within the ZMapp cocktail.

Interpretation. Retrospectively, we show the feasibility of using genomics to rapidly characterise a new Ebola virus variant within the timeframe of an outbreak. Phylogenetic analysis provides further indications that these variants are evolving at differing rates. Rapid in-silico analyses can direct in-vitro experiments to quickly assess medical countermeasures.

Summary
-------
Background. The real-time generation of information about pathogen genomes has become a vital goal for transmission analysis and characterisation in rapid outbreak responses. In response to the recently established genomic capacity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we explored the real-time generation of genomic information at the start of the 2018 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu province.

Findings. The genomic information demonstrated that the EVD outbreak in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces was distinct from the 2018 EVD outbreak in Equateur province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Primer and probe mismatches to Ebola virus were identified in silico for all deployed diagnostic PCR assays, with the exception of the Cepheid GeneXpert GP assay.

Interpretation. The 1st 2 coding-complete genomes provided actionable information in real-time for the deployment of the rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein vaccine, available therapeutics, and sequence-based diagnostic assays. Based on the mutations identified in the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (GP 12) observed in all 48 genomes, deployed monoclonal antibody therapeutics (mAb114 and ZMapp) should be efficacious against the circulating Ebola virus variant. Rapid Ebola virus genomic characterisation should be included in routine EVD outbreak response procedures to ascertain efficacy of medical countermeasures.

The resurgence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Equateur province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2018, is an important reminder of the difficulties of predicting when and where the next outbreak will occur.

The subsequent July 2018 outbreak of EVD in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has affected about 1000 people and the outbreak has the highest case fatality rate (62%) for EVD to date. Conflict, insecurity, poverty, mistrust, poor health systems, and other factors have been implicated in sustaining the outbreak.

The response to the July 2018 EVD outbreak in North Kivu Province has highlighted the positive impact of lessons learnt during the 2013-16 EVD outbreak in west Africa.

These lessons included real-time genomic analysis of viruses and the use of different countermeasures during the outbreak response, strong collaborations between countries of the northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere and between countries within the southern hemisphere and rooted investment for research capacity building to address disease outbreaks, and timely and committed responses from WHO and other health development agencies.

- Tue 16 Apr 2019. The true meaning of leaving no one behind [communication and linguistic groups]
The Lancet Global Health, 2019; 7(5): e533. doi:10.1016/S2214-109X(19)30176-7 https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(19)30176-7/fulltext [abridged, edited]

With roughly 7000 living languages in the world, miscommunication is inevitable, but there are times and places when particular care should be taken to ensure that the message is clear and fully understood. Take the highly volatile situation of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for instance. Since the outbreak was declared in August 2018, there have been over 1000 confirmed and probable cases in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Because the trauma of conflict has compounded the impact of the outbreak on the population, community engagement and ownership of the response are particularly important in the DRC. Last month, Translators without Borders released the results of a rapid study evaluating the effectiveness of risk communication materials on Ebola used in North Kivu. The results are striking: they show that materials used for the response -- posters, brochures, and consent forms for the Ebola vaccine, some in French, some in standard or local Congolese Swahili -- are not fully understood. Basic vocabulary in French related to Ebola was not recognised in focus groups and half of the participants misinterpreted a poster inviting the sick to present to the nearest health centre as the complete opposite, that they would not be welcome there. Consent forms used for the Ebola vaccine were also generally misunderstood, as they contained words in standard Swahili, French, and English that were not known to the participants, raising further ethical issues. This study presents the epitome of where and when the basics of language should be better applied to reach "the furthest behind" in global health.
