A canine-origin human rabies outbreak has been reported in Santa Marta,
which led to 4 deaths, and it is the most severe outbreak in decades,
according to Dr. Alberto Rizo-Gil, Head of the Public Health Academy.
Normally, a single case would be enough to generate an epidemiological
alert. This is because of transmission features and the consideration that
rabies is a lethal disease in 100 percent of cases.
"This situation may indicate that public health measures that should be
applied in such events were absent", said Dr. Rizo-Gil.
The 4 deceased persons developed the disease as a consequence of being
bitten by rabid dogs during the period December 2006 through January 2007.
The Colombian National Institutes of Health confirmed 3 cases, after
analyzing biopsies taken from deceased persons, and they are about to
receive samples from a boy who died last Saturday [27 Jan 2007] with
typical symptoms of rabies.
Mr. Diaz stated that the last case of human rabies caused by dog bites
occurred in 2000. In 2003 there was a case of a boy who was bitten by a
wild skunk, and between May and July 2004, 14 cases were reported in Bajo
Baudo, caused by [vampire?] bat bites. It is worth mentioning that this
rabies virus [from bats] is of a different type from that transmitted by dogs.
According to reports from the Santa Marta Health Secretariat, these 4
persons were apparently bitten last September [2006]. The 1st victim died
on 5 Nov, the second 20 days later, and the 3rd died on 16 Jan 2007. As the
presence of the virus was suspected, health authorities began a massive
canine immunization campaign (22 463 dogs have been vaccinated to date).
One of the indicators from which alerts should be generated is the presence
of animal rabies. For the year 2005, the Magdalena Department had the
highest case toll in the country: 18 of 97 registered cases. Dr. Lenis
Urquijo, head of Public Health at the Social Welfare Ministry, said that
his institution has always provided necessary tools and support so that the
regions may implement every control and preventive measure for facing this
situation, "but ultimately the responsibility lies on the health Secretariats".
Human rabies transmitted by dogs is considered an unacceptable condition,
since it can be prevented with canine vaccination campaigns.
