Deadly disease found in alpacas
-------------------------------
Biosecurity Queensland has confirmed a number of cases of the deadly
melioidosis in alpacas around central Queensland.

The soil borne bacterial disease is primarily found in goats,
alpacas, and sheep, but can affect other animals like pigs and has
been known to kill humans.

Biosecurity Queensland vet Dr Rick Whittle says while there is no
vaccine for the disease, property owners need to remember farm hygiene
practices.

"I think it's extremely difficult to get treatment," he said. "I know
people are trying to treat individual animals and it's probably worth
trying to treat valuable animals. But I think the success rate is not
high, particularly if they are severely clinically affected."

[Whitmore's Disease or melioidosis, or even Nightcliff gardener's
disease is an infectious disease caused by _Burkholderia pseudomallei_
changed from _Pseudomonas pseudomallei_. Humans and animals become
infected through direct contact with a contaminated environment, which
may include water and soil. While transmission may occur to a human
through direct contact of a cut/abrasion or through mucus membranes
from an infected animal, it is rare.

Infections can occur by ingestion, by inhalation, or through wounds
and abrasions. All 3 routes are thought to occur in animals. Infected
animals can shed the organism in wound exudates and, depending on the
site of the infection, from other sources including nasal secretions,
milk, feces, and urine. Transplacental transmission has been reported
in goats, a pig, and a spider monkey. Nosocomial transmission was
reported in 4 cats at a veterinary hospital, possibly via
contamination of a multidose injectable solution. Vector-borne
transmission by mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) and rat fleas
(_Xenopsylla cheopsis_) has been reported, but the role of insect
bites remains uncertain.

Melioidosis is endemic in Southeast Asia, China, the Indian
subcontinent, and parts of Australia. It has also been reported from
the Caribbean, the Middle East, South America, Singapore, and Taiwan.
The situation in Africa is uncertain. Although isolated cases were
reported from some African countries in the past, melioidosis is not a
commonly reported disease in Africa. However, laboratory support is
absent or weak in some countries, and this disease may be
underdiagnosed.

There is some concern that this bacteria may used for biological
weapons, especially as it is similar to _Burkholderia mallei_ which
causes glanders and is transmitted from infected animals to humans.

A misdiagnosis may be fatal; the causative organism, _Burkholderia
pseudomallei_, is susceptible to a limited number of antibiotics. In
endemic areas, melioidosis is an important cause of illness and death
in humans and animals. It is also a serious concern in imported
animals. In 1975, a panda apparently introduced melioidosis to the
Paris Zoo, where it caused a severe outbreak. The epidemic spread to
other zoos in Paris and Mulhouse, and to equestrian clubs throughout
France. It decimated some zoo populations and caused at least 2 human
deaths.

In naturally acquired infections, the incubation period varies from
less than a day (after very high exposure) to several months or years.
Incubation periods of more than 2 months are common. A few cases have
remained subclinical for up to 29 years, and one infection apparently
became symptomatic after 62 years. Infections from aerosolized forms
in biological weapons are expected to have an incubation period of 10
to 14 days.

Acute localized infections sometimes occur at the site of
inoculation. In the skin, these infections appear as gray or white,
firm nodules and ulcers. The nodules may caseate, and are often
surrounded by inflammation. Regional lymphadenopathy and lymphangitis
may also be seen. Other forms of acute localized disease include
suppurative parotitis/parotid abscesses, destructive corneal ulcers
seen after corneal trauma, and cellulitis. Some infections may
resemble necrotizing fasciitis. Genitourinary infections often
manifest as prostatic abscesses. Localized infections can disseminate,
but systemic infections are not always preceded by localized signs.
Skin and subcutaneous infections can also result from the hematogenous
spread of the organisms from other sites.

Pulmonary disease is the most common form of melioidosis. It can
occur as either the primary syndrome or as a component of septicemia.
The symptoms usually include fever, coughing, pleuritic chest pain
and, in some cases, hemoptysis. Ulcerative lesions and nodules are
sometimes found in the nose, and the septum may perforate. Severe
weight loss may be seen. Pulmonary signs can develop suddenly, or may
occur gradually after a prodromal syndrome characterized by headache,
anorexia, and generalized myalgia. Complications include pneumothorax,
empyema, and pericarditis.

Untreated cases often progress to septicemia, the most serious form
of melioidosis. It is most common in people with pre-existing diseases
such as diabetes, cancer, and kidney failure. The onset is usually
acute, with fever, rigors, and other typical signs of sepsis. However,
in some patients septicemia may develop more gradually, with a
fluctuating fever often associated with severe weight loss. Common
symptoms of septicemic melioidosis include fever, severe headache,
disorientation, pharyngitis, upper abdominal pain, diarrhea, jaundice,
and notable muscle tenderness. Pulmonary signs including dyspnea are
common, and arthritis or meningitis may be seen. Some patients have a
disseminated pustular rash with regional lymphadenopathy, cellulitis,
or lymphangitis. Septic shock is common, and it is usually fatal once
it develops.

Chronic melioidosis is characterized by abscesses and suppurative
lesions, which can occur in a variety of organs. Although the liver,
spleen, skeletal muscle, and prostate gland are affected most often,
lesions can occur in any organ including the skin, lung, myocardium,
bone, joints, lymph nodes, and testes. Mycotic aneurysms are also
seen. Rarely, melioidosis can result in brain abscesses,
encephalomyelitis (often accompanied by flaccid paralysis), or
meningitis. Fever may or may not be present in chronic melioidosis.

Some infected patients remain asymptomatic for years. These chronic
carriers may eventually develop clinical disease, typically when they
become immunosuppressed from another condition.

Multiple drugs were generally used in the past, but some newer single
antibiotics are equally effective. Pulmonary resection or drainage of
abscesses is sometimes necessary. Relapses can occur after apparently
successful treatment, and lifelong monitoring is often recommended.

One may ask why it is more common in goats, sheep, camelids, and
pigs? They graze, snuffle, or root closer to the ground, indeed even
ingesting or inhaling soil particles which can carry the disease.
