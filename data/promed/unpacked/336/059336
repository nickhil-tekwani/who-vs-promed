One of 2 people confirmed by the Ministry of Health to have contracted avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection died in a hospital in southwest China's city of Guiyang Wednesday [13 Feb 2013] morning. The patient, a 21-year-old woman, died of multiple organ failure at the Guizhou Provincial People's Hospital at 9:41 [AM] on 13 Feb 2013.

The woman and the other patient, a 31-year-old man, are both Guiyang residents. They developed symptoms on 2 and 3 Feb 2013, respectively. Both of them tested positive for the H5N1 virus on Sunday [10 Feb 2013?], according to the Ministry. Epidemic control experts have not found any indication that the patients had close contact with birds, nor have they found any epidemiological connection between the two cases. People who have had close contact with the 2 patients have been put under medical observation. None have exhibited symptoms.

The human-transmissible form of avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is an acute respiratory infectious disease mainly caused by the deadly A/(H5N1) virus subtype. Main symptoms include high fever and pneumonia. Human infections of bird flu are usually caused by transmission from poultry to humans. There have been no reported cases of sustained human-to-human transmission.

[This report communicates the death of one of the 2 patients described in ProMED-mail post: "Avian influenza, human (05): China (GZ) 20130211.1538795." These 2 patients were not related or known to each other and had no reported contact with poultry. This report brings the total number of human cases of avian A(H5N1) virus infection to 45 and the number of fatalities to 29 since the 1st human cases were described in China in 2003.

According to CIDRAP News, earlier this week, the man was also reported to be in critical condition. "China's 2 new cases fit a pattern of infections without exposure to poultry, raising questions about possible surveillance gaps in poultry or problems with China's vaccination program," (http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/news/feb1313avian.html).
