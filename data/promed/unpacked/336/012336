One Marion County horse has been hospitalized after testing positive for the neurological form of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1), the Oregon Department of Agriculture reported [Thu 30 Apr 2015].

The horse, which has been treated at Oregon State University's (OSU) College of Veterinary Medicine's Large Animal Hospital, began showing acute neurologic signs on [Tue 8 Apr 2015] and was immediately referred to OSU. The positive EHV-1 diagnosis was made on [Wed 29 Apr 2015].

All horses at the Marion County property have been quarantined. The Oregon Department of Agriculture reports there is no indication at this time that the virus has spread to other horses beyond those being quarantined.

Preliminary epidemiological investigations are underway. In all, there are 20 horses at the Marion County stable. The stable owner and all horse owners have been very cooperative and supportive of the disease control actions taken.

The investigation shows that horses from the affected property have attended recent events held at the Linn County Fairgrounds in Albany on 16-19 Apr 2015, and the Oregon Equestrian Center in Eugene on 25-26 Apr 2015. While the risk to these horses appears to be low at this time, concerned horse owners are advised to contact their veterinarian.

EHV-1 is not transmissible to people, the virus is naturally occurring and widespread in the equine population, officials said. It is a common virus and may lie dormant for long periods of time and then re-activate during a period of stress, which can result in clinical disease.

EHV-1 can cause respiratory disease, abortions in pregnant mares, neurologic disease, and in severe cases death. The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact. The virus can also spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, and hands.

Clinical signs include fever, decreased coordination, nasal discharge, urine dribbling, loss of tail tone, hind limb weakness, leaning against a wall or fence to maintain balance, lethargy, and the inability to rise. While there is no cure, the signs of the disease may be treatable.

"The detection of neurologic EHV-1 is taken very seriously, and we are doing our best to notify equine veterinarians and horse owners," said State Veterinarian Dr Brad LeaMaster of ODA (Oregon Department of Agriculture). "We have had occurrences of the disease in Oregon in the past. I appreciate everyone's cooperation in dealing with the disease investigation and control process."

Concerned horse owners are strongly advised to contact their veterinarian if they have questions and for developing an appropriate prevention plan, including vaccination. Vaccination must go hand-in-hand with the use of best management practices.

Horse owners should practice basic every-day biosecurity to protect their horse(s) from being exposed to this virus as well as other highly contagious pathogens.

[The state of Oregon can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3336778,5700. Marion County in northern Oregon can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/oregon-county-map.gif.

This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well. Monitor temperatures of the horses at least twice daily to detect the earliest changes.
