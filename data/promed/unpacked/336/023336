Hepatitis A and Blueberries in New Zealand
----------------------------------------
In the first 5 months of 2002, 81 cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection
were notified in New Zealand [see; ProMED-mail post "Hepatitis A,
blueberries - New Zealand" referenced below. - Mod.CP]. This sharp increase
was investigated with descriptive and analytical epidemiology, virology,
product traceback, and an orchard investigation.
Consumption of raw blueberries was the only significant risk factor
(adjusted odds ratio 7.6; 95 percent confidence intervals 2.6-22.4).
Trace-back of product through retailers and wholesalers implicated a single
commercial orchard. HAV was detected in cases' feces and in blueberries from
the orchard. Sanitary audit of the orchard revealed multiple opportunities
for fecal contamination of product by pickers and the possibility of
contamination by sewage-contaminated groundwater. A child with confirmed
hepatitis A was in the orchard during harvest. Speculation [see; ProMED-mail
post "Hepatitis A, blueberries - New Zealand (02)" listed below] that
pickers urinated on picked fruit to increase the weight is unfounded.
Extensive food safety improvements in the berry fruit industry are underway.
The report on the investigation has been submitted for publication.
