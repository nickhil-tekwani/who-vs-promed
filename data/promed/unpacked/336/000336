Galapagos penguins(_Spheniscus mendiculus_) harbour malaria threat
------------------------------------------------------------------
Penguins and malaria are not 2 organisms you would normally associate
with each other, yet biologists have found the malaria parasite in an
endangered species of the black-and-white waddlers.

Iris Levin of the University of Missouri at St. Louis and her
colleagues took blood samples from 362 Galapagos penguins already
listed as being threatened with extinction on 9 islands in the
Galapagos archipelago.

All of the birds appeared healthy, but the tests revealed that 19 of
the penguins, 5 percent, carried the _Plasmodium_ parasite, which
causes malaria. The infected birds were spread across the
archipelago, suggesting the parasite is not restricted to one small
colony of penguins. Galapagos penguins move around the islands, so
the parasite is likely to spread further, say the researchers.

"_Plasmodium_ in Galapagos penguins is potentially disastrous for
this species," says Bruce Hofkin, a parasitologist at the University
of NewMexico in Albuquerque, who was not involved in the study. "Most
penguin species are very susceptible to _Plasmodium_ and avian
malaria is a real problem in zoos, where it is a major problems in
penguin exhibits."

Dangerous visitor
-----------------
The mosquitoes that can carry _Plasmodium_ arrived on the archipelago
in the 1980s, presumably on incoming boats or flights. Researchers
have been concerned that the parasite may take hold but had not found
any evidence of it until now.

Levin says that although the birds were healthy, there is still cause
for concern. The biologists point out that _Plasmodium_ has decimated
wild bird populations in Hawaii; that the strain they found is
closely related to a strain that causes avian malaria in captive
penguins; and that the Galapagos penguins are unlikely to have
encountered the malaria parasite before, making them vulnerable to it.

One other factor concerns them at least as much as all of the above
is the El Nino phenomenon. The reduction in fish numbers during El
Nino seasons can slash the penguin population in the Galapagos by up
to 80 percent. The researchers fear that this could trigger malaria
signs and deaths in infected birds.

Although the Galapagos penguin population has been on the rise since
the major El Nino event of 1997-1998, when the penguins are thought
to have been free of _Plasmodium_ (Marine Ornithology, vol 29, p 43),
it is still only half of what it was before.

Other research has suggested that stress can increase the death rate
among birds that have malaria. And computer models suggest El Nino
events may become slightly stronger with climate change. Put all this
together, say the researchers, and you get the picture of the
Galapagos penguins under attack from all sides.

[Penguin malaria, caused by _Plasmodium relictum_ & _P. elongatum_,
is characterized by the exoerythrocytic (EE) forms in many different
tissues and overall low-grade parasitemia. Either organism is capable
of causing rapidly fatal disease with barely detectable parasitemias
-- the EE stages are the key to understanding the pathology
(Fleischman et al. 1968. J Am Vet Med Assoc 153:928-935).

Chloroquine and primaquine can be used to effectively treat infected
birds (Stoskopf and Beier 1979. J Am Vet Med Assoc 175:944-947). The
epidemiology of infection and zoo management issues for Black-footed
penguins at the Baltimore Zoo is well documented and has been applied
to penguin malaria since the 1970s (Beier and Stoskopf 1980. J Zoo An
Med 11:99-105).

The _Plasmodium_ protozoan parasite has been detected in temperate
and sub-Antarctic species, including African _S. demersus_,
Yellow-eyed _Megadyptes antipodes_, Rockhopper _Eudyptes chrysocome_
and Chinstrap _Pygoscelis Antarctica_ Penguins (Clarke and Kerry
1993).

While this article does not tell us how they tested for the malarial
organism, it is likely that a PCR was used. While it is possible to
diagnoses the organism on blood smears, this may have been a
cumbersome technique for the number of animals that may have been
sampled.

_Culex_ sp and _Aedes_ sp are likely the vectors of the organism, but
this article is not specific on the disease vector. - Mod.TG]
