-------------------------------------------------------------------
Although less recognized than other forms of viral hepatitis, several
studies have suggested that hepatitis E virus infection is common in
the United States. [1,2]

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 21.0 percent of non-institutionalized Americans -- with highest
rates among US-born individuals, males, non-Hispanic whites, and
individuals residing in the Midwest and/or in metropolitan areas (1988 to 1994)
- 13.6 percent of destitute and 15 percent of homeless persons in Los
Angeles (2000)
- 2.1 percent of blood donors (1992 publication)
- 29.3 percent of patients with chronic liver disease (Cincinnati,
Ohio, 1995 to 2006)
- 23 percent to 26 percent of veterinarians treating swine, compared
to 18 percent of a control group of blood donors (1999)
- 0.9 percent of swine workers in North Carolina (2002 publication)
- 77 percent of wild rats in Maryland (1997)
- 73.5 percent of Norway rats in Baltimore (2005 to 2006)
