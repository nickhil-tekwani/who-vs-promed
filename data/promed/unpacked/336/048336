After the last summer's [2018] panic, streams on the Golan Heights have again been found contaminated. A total of 5 streams on the Golan Heights have been found contaminated according to tests conducted by the Ministry of Health (MOH). They are the Zaki stream, Yehudiya, Meshushim stream, the Majrasa estuary, and the El Al stream. The MOH is trying to calm the public, emphasizing that this is not a leptospirosis problem but other infections [see commentary].

In the streams where contamination was found, printed signs have been placed, presenting warnings against entering the water. However, following the extensive damage caused to tourism in the north last year [2018] due to the leptospirosis panic, it has been decided not to close the reserves at this stage, but to carry out further tests on Thursday [6 Jun 2019] and then decide whether to forbid entry to the water [see item 2].

According to the results of repeated tests conducted yesterday [6 Jun 2019] by the Ministry of Health in the Majrasa estuary on the Golan, this touristic swimming site has been found contaminated [in addition to 4 other sites found contaminated earlier this week]. The following 5 sites are closed to swimmers:

- Majrase (Majrase-Beteha Nature Reserve)
- Meshushim (Meshushim Nature Reserve)
- Yehudiya (Yehudia Nature Reserve)
- Zaki (Zakhi)
- El Al stream

[Israel suffered an epidemic of human leptospirosis in June-August 2018, linked to contaminated northern bathing/swimming water sites, in particular the Golan Heights. According to the Ministry of Health (epidemiology department), weekly epidemiological report no. 52 for 2018, the accumulated nationwide number of cases, during the year, was 500 (e.g., compared with 10 during 2017, 7 during 2016, and 7 during 2015). The (bilingual) reports are available at https://tinyurl.com/y6jdqv82. Several travel-associated cases were reported from the USA and Germany; there have probably been additional cases in other countries.

On top of the serious public health impact, which included complicated cases but no mortalities, the epidemic caused substantial financial losses by its deleterious effect upon tourism, one of the main income sources of the region.

The presumed chain of transmission implicated cattle and wild boar, shedding _Leptospira pomona_ bacteria, as the main source of the water contamination. The epidemic, and corresponding multiple challenges for risk assessment, risk management and risk communication, was addressed by an interministerial public health response team; see ProMED post 20180923.6047216 and the reference below.

It was hoped that during the subsequent rainy winter season (October 2018 to April 2019), the large quantities of rain water streaming through the water routes, combined with vaccination of the grazing cattle, would eliminate the environmental contamination. Several weeks into the 2019 dry season, this wishful prediction is unfortunately being challenged. The profile of the current contamination is yet to be fully clarified: Limited to fecal coli? _Leptospira_ excluded?

According to unofficial sources, Israel's government agreed to suggestions by the interministerial team to make a budget available for several prioritized activities to prevent continued contamination and disease. This should include enhanced cattle vaccination and the provision of watering facilities to keep animals away from the natural water bodies.

Epidemiological data, surveillance results, and vaccination statistics are essential for the team's discussions and decisions. Exercising transparency, namely, keeping the public informed by making the team's discussions, the budget's coverage, the epidemiological statistics (_L. pomona_ in animals), and activities publicly available, is expected to increase the chances of the project's goals being attained and prevent panic recurrence. - Mod.AS
