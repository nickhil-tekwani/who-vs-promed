In the western African state of Senegal, about 200 fishermen have contracted an unknown disease. According to the governor of the Senegal metropolitan region, Al Hassan Sall, it was initially known about 82 cases, but later this figure increased to at least 200 patients. The authorities believe that the source of the infection is the water in the sea. The center of distribution is located between the port cities of Rufisk and Mbour.

The incubation period of the disease is several days. The infection manifests itself as follows: the skin of the diseased is covered with ulcers that itch. According to the fishermen themselves, the parts of the body that have come into contact with the water in the ocean are most affected.

All infected were hospitalized. Local authorities are holding an urgent meeting about the incident. Representatives of the fishing industry were invited to attend. Based on [the meeting] results, further actions will be determined.

[It is not clear what this disease is. We have parasites that penetrate the skin from contaminated soil, like hookworms and strongyloides, and fresh water cercariae from duck schistosoma, but nothing to my knowledge in salt water. The only salt water nematode anisakis lives inside fish and may cause an intestinal infection when an infected fish is eaten.

If the incubation period had been longer, a possibility would be _Mycobacterium marinum_, but that is not seen in outbreaks, and, as with other mycobacteria, the incubation period is counted in weeks. - Mod.EP
