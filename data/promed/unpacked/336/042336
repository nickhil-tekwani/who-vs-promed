Measles of same genotype (D6) as seen in Ukraine
------------------
As of 12 Apr 2006, 660 cases of measles have been reported in the
federal state of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany [1]. The 1st cases
connected with this outbreak were notified in January [2]. The most
affected areas are the city of Duisburg (188 cases), Moenchengladbach
(76 cases), and the district of Wesel (101 cases). Other cities in
the state have registered more cases than in the same period in
previous years. In contrast to previous outbreaks, when mostly small
children were affected, half (49 percent) of the patients in this
outbreak (n=323) are aged between 10 and 19 years, and 18 percent are
patients aged over 20 years (n=116). Initial analysis of notification
data has shown that the overwhelming majority of the patients
(greater than 90 percent) have not been vaccinated. About 20 percent
of patients required hospital admission.
Initial laboratory results have shown that measles virus type D6 is
the main cause of this outbreak in Nordrhein-Westfalen; the same
genotype that has recently caused a large outbreak in the Ukraine
[3]. However, until now, no direct contact with any Ukrainian
patients by the patients in Nordrhein-Westfalen has been established.
Very recently, a 2nd genotype (D4) has been isolated from 2 patients.
Together with the regional authorities, the Robert Koch Institute is
undertaking an outbreak investigation to better estimate the extent
of the outbreak, and to establish a possible source of infection and
transmission routes. Immunisation record cards are being checked to
determine to what extent existing susceptibility has contributed to
the current measles outbreak.
As the outbreak and its investigation are not yet finished, all
results provided above are preliminary and might still change.

[It appears this is a major year for measles activity in Europe.
ProMED-mail has reported outbreaks in the Ukraine, Greece, and the UK
since the beginning of 2006 (see below). The genotypes currently
involved strongly suggest that the above outbreak in Germany is
related to the one in the Ukraine. Unfortunately, because we do not
know the genotypes involved in Greece or the UK, whether they might
also be associated with the Ukraine remains unknown.
In the end-of-year report on measles activity in the UK for 2005,
there was mention of a B3 genotype associated with measles activity
in a "travelling community"
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/pages/immunisation.htm#mmr_q42005>. The
most recent HPA report on measles activity in the UK (23 Mar 2006)
mentions involvement of the "travelling community", suggesting
perhaps that the B3 genotype is involved in the 2006 activity as well
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/archives/2006/cdr1206.pdf>.
In addition to the above-mentioned outbreaks, there has been renewed
measles virus circulation in Venezuela after 4 years without virus
activity (see below). The index case for the Venezuelan outbreak was
an airline pilot returning to Venezuela from Spain in February 2006.
Information on the genotype responsible for the outbreak in Venezuela
(ex Spain) was also unavailable to us, although as stated by Mod.CP
in ProMED-mail posting Measles - Venezuela 20060328.0944, "Recently
an unusually large outbreak of measles in the Khmelnizkiy region of
Ukraine was described in ProMED-mail (see references below). The D6
genotype of measles virus appeared to be associated with this
outbreak. Other sporadic cases of D6 genotype measles virus infection
were observed at the same time in both adjacent and more remote
countries and were considered to be imported cases: 2 cases in
Belarus, 9 cases in the Russian Federation, 2 cases in the United
States, and one case in Spain. If it is established that a D6
genotype measles virus is responsible for the Venezuelan outbreak,
this outbreak may also be linked to the Ukrainian outbreak since the
index case appears to be an airline pilot who contracted infection in
Spain."
In the past few years, we have been reminded very clearly that we
live in a global village with respect to disease transmission.
Recently there has been laboratory evidence of geographic spread of
the viruses causing a number of vaccine-preventible childhood
diseases. The re-introduction of polio into countries that had
interrupted transmission of the wild poliovirus has been traced to
continued transmission of the wild poliovirus in endemic countries
such as India and Nigeria (where vaccination was suspended for a
period of time, leading to an increase in local transmission, and
then international exportation of the wild poliovirus). The ongoing
mumps outbreak in the USA involves the same virus as the current
outbreak in the UK. And as reported above, the outbreak of measles
in Germany involves a virus that is currently circulating in the
Ukraine. - Mod.MPP]
