A dead crested myna found near Santa Monica Avenue in Yuen Long on 27 Apr 2012 has tested H5 positive, and more tests are underway, the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department announced today [2 May 2012].

The department has stepped up cleaning and disinfection at the venue. Its staff also inspected 4 farms within 3 km of where the carcass was found. There had been no abnormal deaths or avian flu symptoms among the chicken flocks.

The department has phoned poultry farmers and sent letters to farmers, pet bird shop owners and license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons to remind them to step up precautionary measures.
