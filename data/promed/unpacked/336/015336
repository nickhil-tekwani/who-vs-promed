Influenza update - 368 (based on data up to 10 May 2020)
--------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
------
- The current influenza surveillance data should be interpreted with caution, as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic might have influenced to varying extents health-seeking behaviours, staffing/routines in sentinel sites, as well as testing priorities and capacities in Member States. The various hygiene and physical distancing measures implemented by Member States to reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission might also have played a role in interrupting influenza virus transmission.
- Globally, influenza activity appeared to be at lower levels than expected for this time of the year. In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, a sharp decline of influenza activity was observed in recent weeks, while in the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, the influenza season has not started yet.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity was low overall. An overall increase in excess all-cause mortality was seen across the countries of the EuroMOMO [European Mortality Monitoring] network.
- In the Caribbean and Central American countries, no or low influenza detections were reported in most reporting countries. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) activity appeared to decrease in Jamaica.
- In tropical South American countries, influenza detections were low.
- In tropical Africa, there were no influenza virus detections reported in this period.
- In Southern Asia, influenza-like illness (ILI) and SARI activity was low in Bhutan and Nepal.
- In South East Asia, no influenza detections were reported.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at interseasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 62 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 27 Apr 2020 to 10 May 2020 (data as of 22 May 2020 04:54:52 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 176 833 specimens during that time period. A total of 149 specimens were positive for influenza viruses, of which 88 (59.1%) were typed as influenza A and 61 (40.9%) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 14 (73.7%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 5 (26.3%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 1 (100%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 0 (0%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

WHO encourages the testing of routine influenza surveillance samples from sentinel and non-sentinel sources for COVID-19 where resources are available and invites all countries/areas/territories to report this information (ideally indicating which data are from sentinel sites) to routine, established regional and global platforms (see the Operational considerations for COVID-19 surveillance using GISRS guidance at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/surveillance-and-case-definitions).

[According to the report above, only 149 of 176 833 specimens tested positive for influenza viruses; that is 0.084% positive samples, which is a very low percentage, even for this time of the year. It would be prudent to reflect on the data from the same epidemiological weeks in 2019: WHO Influenza update - 342 states, "...territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 29 Apr 2019 to 12 May 2019 (data as of 24 May 2020 03:41:52 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 80 173 specimens during that time period; 7693 were positive for influenza viruses." (https://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2019_05_27_update_GIP_surveillance/en/). This equals an influenza percentage of approximately 9.6%. The 2020 figure is way too low to be ignored.

This raises many important questions: Is influenza surveillance being impacted by the intense demands of the COVID-19 pandemic? Or more importantly, are the influenza circulation patterns being displaced by SARS-CoV-2? One way to get some answers would be to test the acute respiratory illness samples for influenza as well as for SARS-CoV-2 to understand the distribution of individual or co-infections. The next few reports may clarify this trend further. - Mod.UBA]
