H5N1 virus confirmed in Romania
---------------------------------------
Samples from chickens collected in Jurj Vasile (Romania) and analyzed at
the OIE Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza, Weybridge, UK have been
confirmed to contain Influenza A subtype H5N1.

As already expected by the OIE on Thursday (see OIE press release 13 Oct
2005 <http://www.oie.int/eng/press/en_051013.htm>), the analyses carried
out show a direct relationship with the avian influenza viruses detected
recently in central Asia and Turkey.
A 2nd Romanian outbreak has been reported to the OIE. It is located in
Maliuc County, 60 km from the 1st one reported in Ceamurlia-de-Josle.
With regard to Turkey, more information is currently being requested from
the Turkish authorities concerning a 2nd possible outbreak at the border
with Iran.
The active role of migratory birds carrying the Asian H5N1 influenza virus
under certain conditions to other parts of the world seems now to be more
likely.
Following the situation very closely, the OIE again gives a reminder of the
importance of eliminating the virus at the animal source, emphasizing the
need for early detection and rapid response mechanisms carried out by
Veterinary Services in countries at risk.
It is urgent to take the relevant measures to tackle avian influenza at its
animal source in order to prevent a possible human pandemic. Indeed, the
possibility of a human pandemic is directly linked to the quantity of the
H5N1 virus circulating among animals worldwide.

In the last few days, we have confirmed evidence of H5N1 in 2 countries,
Turkey and Romania. There appear to be unconfirmed indications of a 2nd
foci in each of these countries. Moreover, there is some information in
this OIE report that indicates that the 2nd outbreak in Turkey is close to
the border with Iran. Thus, the possibility is raised that the wild bird
die off in Iran will turn out to be due to H5N1 avian influenza because of
the close geographic location and proximity in timing. Finally, there
appear to be reports of avian influenza in Greece.
This flurry of reports should be treated with caution because of the
possibilities of over reaction and speculation that accompany any
unconfirmed report. However, the OIE confirmation is from World Reference
Laboratories, and we can rely on these. Put all this together, and it is
clear that something is happening in the swath of land surrounding the
Caspian and Black Seas. Today's OIE press release certainly speculates that
the migratory birds are a suspected means of spread.
As difficult as it is to deal with, we have to face the possibility of
avian influenza establishing a new major foci of infection in large parts
of Central Asia and Eurasia. Will we have the political will and resources
to control and eradicate these new incursions of the virus? Such was
clearly lacking in Southeast Asia, or we wouldn't be in this situation.
Unfortunately, if the scenario in Eurasia keeps developing, we will soon
come to another question: can we stamp H5N1 out, or do we "learn to live
with it," again? "Learning to live with it" appears not to have worked too
well the 1st time around, and it is always better to stamp out a small foci
of disease rather than control or eradicate a well-established one. - Mod.PC]
