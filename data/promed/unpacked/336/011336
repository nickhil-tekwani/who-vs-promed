At least 18 cattle have died of an unidentified bovine disease in the
past week in Erode district of Tamil Nadu, an official said Friday
[11 Jul 2008]. "About 18 cattle have died in and around
Sathyamangalam town since 4 Jul 2008. Preliminary examinations of the
blood and viscera after post mortem have revealed no contagious
disease," K. Periyasamy, joint director of the state animal husbandry
department, told IANS [Indo-Asian News Service].

"We have ordered further tests, since we suspect that contamination
of water bodies or meadows may have led to the deaths," Periyasamy added.

He ruled out the spread of mad cow disease in Sathyamanglam, about
350 km from state capital Chennai [Zoom in on the map at

"Our cows have no recourse to commercial feed made of crushed bones
and other inorganic materials, which cause mad cow disease," Periyasamy said.

Although officials said 18 cattle had died, local TV channels
reported that over 200 animals had died in the past fortnight.

The Cauvery and Bhavani rivers flowing through the region have been
polluted by toxic waste dumped by thousands of textile dyeing units,
despite the Madras High Court's repeated intervention on the basis of
petitions filed by environmentalists.

epidemiological, clinical and laboratory (including toxicological)
investigations will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
