[1] Cholera - Ghana (Greater Accra Region)

The number of cholera cases reported in the Greater Accra Region has increased from 3600 to 5000 with 45 deaths since July 2014, the Greater Accra Regional Health Director of the Ghana Health Service, Dr Linda Van Otoo, has said. Out of these numbers, the Accra metropolis alone recorded about 2500 cases with about 1000 cases reported in a week.

Dr Otoo made this known when the Minister of Health, Dr Kwaku Agyeman-Mensah, and his Deputy, Dr Victor Bampoe, accompanied by the Greater Accra Regional Minister, Nii Laryea Afotey-Agbo, the Director General of the Ghana Health Service, Dr Ebenezer Appiah Denkyira, and some other officials visited the La General Hospital in Accra Mon 18 Aug 2014.

The visit was for the minister to be abreast with how the hospital was handling the outbreak of cholera in the La community, as well as find ways of assisting health personnel to perform their duties diligently. As of the time of the visit, the hospital had recorded about 790 cholera cases since the 1st outbreak in July 2014.

Dr Otoo said over the years, the region had been recording very high numbers of cholera cases. She said in 2013, there was no case of cholera reported, adding that, "We had about 22 cases of diarrhoea with no deaths." Unfortunately, she said 2014 had come with its own woes, as the number of cases reported in the region was increasing.

Dr Otoo said records available showed that the disease was attacking the productive age groups, while some few cases of children and the aged had been reported. She said the disease attacked more males than females.

In his remarks, the Minister of Heath, Dr Kwaku Agyeman-Mensah, commended all hospital authorities for the efforts they put into alleviating the outbreak of cholera in the metropolis. He described the situation as sad, adding that the deaths could have been prevented if patients had reported to the hospitals early. "45 preventable deaths have been recorded, and this is sad because people are not paying attention to personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness," he said.

Dr Agyeman-Mensah said it was high time the sanitation by-laws were used to deal with those who flouted the laws in order to help reduce the number of people who got infected and died from cholera. He said the ministry would make available all resources that were needed to help curb the cholera epidemic, adding that, "We must all work together and make sure that what has happened is not repeated."

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Ashanti Region)

Ashanti Region has recorded its 1st cholera death, while 21 others are in critical condition since a renewed outbreak of the disease in parts of the country in recent months. Three districts in the region have recorded more than one case each since the beginning of this month [August 2014], health authorities said.

Public health officials warn that the situation could get worse if sanitation is not improved. This will be the worst cholera outbreak in the region in 4 years. It comes after the Greater Accra Region reported 47 deaths from over 4000 confirmed cases since the outbreak of the disease in June 2014.

Adansi South District, where the infection claimed one life, has recorded 5 cases, while the Kumasi metropolis leads with 7. A chunk of Kumasi's cases were recorded at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and the Kumasi South Hospital. The death occurred at Kokonteng, where many residents engage in open air defecation. The Komfo Anokye Hospital has treated 10 cases, including 5 Kumasi residents, while the others came from outside the city.

Authorities say conditions and factors that prompted the outbreak in Accra are prevalent in Kumasi and other parts of the region. They cite piled-up refuse, open defecation, and general unsanitary conditions as the causes.

[3] Cholera - China (Hong Kong)

The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced they were investigating a confirmed case of cholera this weekend. The case involved a 31-year-old man who has had diarrhea since 22 May 2014 after traveling to Shenzhen on 20 May 2014. He has developed on and off bowel symptoms since then and sought medical treatment from a private doctor on 13 Aug 2014.

Laboratory tests today [18 Aug 2014] showed that his stool specimen yielded _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 serotype Inaba. He is receiving isolation treatment at Princess Margaret Hospital and is now in stable condition. His travel, collateral, and home contacts have no cholera symptoms. The mainland health authority has been notified of the case. The CHP's investigation is underway.

[4] Diarrhea - Solomon Islands (Malaita Province)
Date: Thu 21 Aug 2014

http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/national/3550-diarrhoea-outbreak-reported-on-sikaiana


Sikai'ana, in the Malaita Outer Islands, is currently facing a diarrhea outbreak, with reports claiming that a child has already died as a result. Reports reaching the Solomon Star claimed that the diarrhea outbreak is taking its toll on the Malaita outer island of Sikai'ana, with many living in a state of panic, especially with the lack of medical assistance, which could result in many more casualties.

"Already, one child has died of diarrhoea on Sikai'ana, and we are scared many more may follow due to the lack of medical or health resources on the island," a villager from Sikai'ana told the Solomon Star. "We do not have any health post whatsoever, and there isn't any medical professional around also that can assist those who need medical attention. People, therefore, resort to home medication, mostly herbs and other natural or homemade fluids, to help children down with diarrhoea," the villager said.

He said that lack of clean drinking water is also another problem faced on the island and a cause of the outbreak.
