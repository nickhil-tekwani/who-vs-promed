For 25 years, [PM] has earned a living buying and selling monkeys, bats, and other animals popularly known as bush meat along the Congo River. Standing on the riverbank in Mbandaka, a city affected by the deadly new outbreak of the Ebola virus, the father of 5 said that for the 1st time he's worried he won't be able to support his family.

"Since Ebola was declared, business has decreased by almost half. It's really, really bad," the 47-year-old said, hanging his head.

Congo's latest Ebola outbreak declared in May [2018] has 38 confirmed cases, including 14 deaths. The discovery of a handful of Ebola cases among Mbandaka's more than 1 million residents also has hurt the economy, especially among traders of meat from wild animals.

The virus, which spreads through bodily fluids of those infected, has been known to jump from animals such as monkeys and bats to humans. In the West Africa outbreak 4 years ago that killed more than 11 000 people, it was widely suspected that the epidemic began when a 2-year-old boy in Guinea was infected by a bat.

Usually the wild animals are highly sought-after as popular sources of protein along with beef and pork, and cargo ships carrying the smoked meat arrive daily in the city, the trade hub for Congo's northwestern Equateur province. Meanwhile, bush meat markets still see locals bartering for the animals, both dead and alive. Prospective buyers pause at tables piled with monkey meat, picking up blackened chunks one by one for a closer look.

"Meat is very important for people here. It's one of the biggest industries in Mbandaka," said Matondo, a leader in the city's bush meat association.

Dr Pierre Rollin, an Ebola expert with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said if the meat is cooked, smoked, or dried it kills the virus. The people at greatest risk are hunters and butchers who process the meat, he said.

The World Health Organization has advised against trade and travel restrictions because of the current outbreak, which is mostly in remote areas.

Boats with bush meat continue to depart for the capital, Kinshasa, 600 kilometres (323 miles) downstream and for villages tucked deep in the rainforest up and down the river. Disease experts warned, however, that precautions are still necessary as monkeys and bats are sold live throughout the region.

Traders said demand has dwindled because of Ebola, with sales for many dropping from about 100 animals a day to about 20.

"Kinshasa and Brazzaville told us to stop sending monkeys and bats," said another trader in Mbandaka, [WT], who said his business has been cut in half in recent weeks. He was referring to buyers in the capital of the nearby Republic of Congo, which is across the river from Kinshasa.

Congo's health minister, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said there are no plans to ban sales of bush meat in the province since bush meat is not the primary way the Ebola virus spreads. Instead, the government is focusing on good hygiene practices such as hand-washing, he said.

Health officials are also tracking down anyone who had close contact with anyone infected by the virus, offering an experimental vaccine and promoting safe burials and other practices. Such health efforts can be challenging in communities where many people consider Ebola to be witchcraft. Others are skeptical that the disease exists, even though this is the Central African country's ninth outbreak.

One Mbandaka trader, [GL], said he's still shipping 100 wild animals to Kinshasa daily and said he won't stop eating them as they're his main source of food. "I don't see Ebola. It isn't here," he said.

In West Africa, where there had never been an outbreak before 2014, getting people to accept that Ebola was a real disease was key, said WHO's Jonathan Polonsky.

For those in Kinshasa, "Ebola is very far away," said Defede Mbale, immigration chief at the capital's port of Maluku.

Pointing to a poster of safe Ebola practices on his desk, he said the government has provided extra resources to patrol the river and take people's temperatures as they arrive by boats, checking for fevers.

He doesn't doubt the deadly virus exists, but Mbale said there's only so much that he's willing to change.

"We have our customs and they won't change because of Ebola," he said. "We'll eat all foods."

[Wildlife trade as a potential risk for pathogen translocation has been the focus of a large number of scientific reports and reviews. Legal and illegal movements of wildlife and wildlife products, including meat from wild animals ("bushmeat"), are a potential source of zoonotic diseases.

This article unveils another negative consequence of the emergence of an infectious disease like Ebola, which is the impact on local livelihoods and economies. - Mod.PMB]

[One organization exploring alternatives to wild animal meat ("bushmeat") in East Africa, which does not include the DRC but is nonetheless relevant, discusses its mission in http://www.bushmeatnetwork.org/alternatives.html. "Illegal bushmeat hunting in Africa is conducted for 2 primary purposes: food and livelihood. As the numbers of rural households increases over time ..., pressures for limited land and food increase. These pressures are compounded by climate change, which is predicted to reduce food and livelihood security over the coming century. One of the impacts will be increased reliance on natural resources, including wildlife, to satisfy demand." ...

This report acknowledges the complexity of the problem, and in response offers such alternatives as developing protein alternatives to bushmeat that could also serve as a source of sustainable income, and bringing more fish protein into the local markets to provide increased revenue through alternative means to hunting.

Conservation experts estimate that 5-6 M tons of wild animal meat are harvested in the Congo Basin each year. In the absence of a sizeable domestic meat industry the creation of which would carry its own environmental consequences -- hunting and trapping provide an important source of protein and rural food security (National Geographic).

Further, a report from the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) said a blanket ban on hunting would lead to "dire consequences" for the region's poor, 80 per cent of whom rely on wild animal meat as their only source of fat or protein. They report that replacing wild animal meat consumption in the Congo Basin with cattle would require converting up to 25 million hectares of land into pastures.

Overall, international trade in wild animal products has an estimated value of GBP 2 billion (about USD 2.65 billion). CIFOR said European countries are responsible in driving this demand and also in driving demand for other resources which indirectly cause an increase in the need for wild animal meat by relocating families to forest areas for logging, mining, and drilling.

Robert Nasi (Deputy Director General for Research ) said the "crackdown" advocated by some conservation organisations has led to confusion in many communities. Instead he said rules should be enforced to stop endangered animals being hunted and alternatives should be provided.

"Only if the local hunter is bestowed with some right to decide what, where and how he may hunt -- as well as the knowledge to understand the consequences of his decisions -- will he embrace his responsibility to hunt sustainably," he said.

What is not mentioned in the articles discussed here is risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens to hunters of wildlife, which is really the issue at hand in the origin of recent Ebola outbreaks. The hunting and butchering of wildlife, as well as transporting of live animals that may be shedding pathogens is the problem. As Pierre Rollin of the US CDC stated, it is not the actual eating of cooked wild animal meat. Public health interventions need to target the drivers that lead to hunting behavior in order to effect a change in behavior. That being said, the origin of the current DRC outbreak has not been confirmed to be due to hunting of wild animal meat, although that seems highly likely. - Mod.LK
