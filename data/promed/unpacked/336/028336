At a news conference held in Kano on [Wed 28 Mar 2018], the Commissioner of Health, Kabiru Gesto, revealed that the unknown disease responsible for the death of 8 persons is an outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis.

The government had initially dispatched a rapid response team to carry out an investigation. "The team reported that the 1st case was reported on [Thu 15 Mar 2018] in the area and the victims died instantly before reaching a health facility," he said. Getso gave further details saying that the patients had a high fever and convulsion as well as vomiting and was later confirmed to be cerebrospinal meningitis type A [_Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A?].

He said surveillance has been strengthened to fish out unreported cases and has also set up a special team to tackle the people identified with the disease. In addition, he said, the ministry has also embarked on massive mobilization of people affected with the disease because of its nature of being contagious.

[The exact location of the 8-person outbreak of meningitis type A [presumably _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A] is not specified in the news report from Kano, Nigeria. Kano is the state capital of Kano State in northwest Nigeria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano). Kano State is located between Katsina State, where ProMED-mail recently reported the deaths of 8 students from an undiagnosed illness and Jigawa State, where ProMED-mail also recently reported the deaths of 8 students from meningitis, the type not being specified at the time (see prior ProMED-mail post Meningitis, undiagnosed illness - Nigeria: (KT) fatal, schoolchildren, RFI 20180324.5707401.) It could be a previously unreported outbreak in Kano State, or perhaps it is referring to the outbreaks in neighboring Katsina or Jigawa States. More information is required concerning these outbreaks in northern Nigeria.
