Birds reportedly falling out of the sky and found dead in parts of the Eastern Cape have died of Avian Paramyxovirus and Newcastle diseases.

The Eastern Cape department of Rural Development and Agrarian Reform confirmed the test results on Tuesday [13 Apr 2021].

Hundreds of bird deaths have been reported in the Buffalo City Municipality since March [2021], which prompted Neville's Snake and Reptile Rescue to collect dead birds for testing at the SPCA. Wild birds found mysteriously dying in Gqeberha were also handed to state veterinarians for testing.

Testing and investigation included tracing of birds, collecting and conducting post mortems to identify the cause of bird deaths. Samples collected were sent to the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research (OVR) Laboratory for analysis.

On [7 Apr 2021], test results came back indicating the birds were positive for avian paramyxovirus or Newcastle disease.

Veterinarians specializing in birds have found a pattern in which wild doves seem to be highly susceptible to paramyxovirus in cycles of 4 years.

Avian paramyxovirus, commonly found in many countries, is reportedly a viral infection that can spread rapidly causing high rates of pigeon illness and death.

According to the report human infections are rare and might only occur in people who are in close contact with infected birds, causing flu- like symptoms.

Signs that a bird may have the diseases are lethargy, vomiting or regurgitation, green diarrhea, twisting of the neck, circling, head flicking, labored breathing and runny eyes. Sick birds can die within 3 days.

Newcastle disease is a viral infection of chickens (poultry) and other birds. It is reportedly a worldwide problem that causes acute respiratory disease.

Owners of domestic poultry are advised to use the registered Newcastle vaccine to prevent any more bird deaths. At this time contact between wild birds and domestic poultry should also be prevented at all costs.

[Avian paramyxovirus 1 (APMV-1; Fam. Paramyxoviridae) is the etiologic agent of Newcastle disease. APMV-1 strains maintained in pigeon populations have some antigenic differences from other APMV-1 isolates, and are sometimes called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), which was first reported in racing pigeons in Italy in 1981, and then it became pandemic.

Several Newcastle disease outbreaks in chickens have been attributed to PPMV-1, which makes it a real threat to the poultry industry. - Mod.PMB
