Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Marie-Claude Bibeau, announced a federal investment to support the Canadian Horticultural Council's (CHC) research into managing the potato early dying (PED) disease. The horticulture sector contributed additional [funds].

The purpose of the project is said to provide potato growers with the knowledge, tools, and technologies they need to manage PED, which results in premature aging [of potato vines], limiting potato yield by as much as 50 percent. The CHC will survey potato fields to determine the levels of PED and evaluate the control of PED through growers' cropping systems, best management practices, and control products.

[The terms potato early dying (PED), early maturity wilt or early vine death are confusingly being used to describe a set of symptoms (syndrome) due to both verticillium wilt and a disease complex (co-infection) of verticillium species with nematodes or other fungi. Tuber yield losses of up to 50 percent have been reported.

Verticillium wilts of potato and other solanaceous crops may be caused either by _Verticillium dahliae_ (Vd) or _V. albo-atrum_ (Vaa). The role of these fungi as the main cause depends on the area and climatic conditions, with Vaa more prevalent in cooler regions. Symptoms can be confused with other diseases or disorders and may include: chlorosis, necrosis, and wilting of foliage; internal discolouration and necrosis of stems; collapse, premature senescence, and early death of the whole plant. Symptoms and yield losses can increase considerably through synergistic interactions of Vd or Vaa with other pathogenic fungi (such as _Colletotrichum_ species) or some species of root-lesion nematodes (_Pratylenchus_ species).

All these pathogens can be spread with soil, contaminated equipment, and plant material (including seed tubers). They can survive without a host for many years and accumulate under continuous potato cropping. Consequently, PED gets more severe over time and yield losses increase. All plants in a potato field may die within a few weeks. Disease management of soil borne pathogens is difficult due to the long retention of infectivity of soils and because agrochemicals are generally not very effective against soil borne pathogens.

An integrated management approach is required for PED, including phytosanitation (exclusion), cultural measures (such as long crop rotation with non-host species) and use of crop cultivars with reduced sensitivity to the pathogens. However, no commercial potato cultivars completely resistant or tolerant to Vd are available. Furthermore, more research is needed on potential impact of control measures on soil microbiomes. For example, use of agrochemicals (such as soil fumigants) may reduce beneficial microbes and thus aggravate PED in subsequent crops. A combination of agrochemicals to reduce fungal and nematode numbers followed by measures to improve soil health (compost, green manures) may be considered.
