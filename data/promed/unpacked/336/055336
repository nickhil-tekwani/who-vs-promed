taken place earlier; when?! This is valid for the 3 countries. - Mod.AS]

Bluetongue: Commission Decision on precautionary measures backed by
Member States
-----------------------------------------------
A Commission Decision on protection measures to be taken against
bluetongue was backed by Member State veterinary experts in the
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health this afternoon
[21 Aug 2006]. The Decision was drawn up in response to the recent
outbreaks of this disease in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.
The 150-km surveillance zone is formally defined and listed in the
Annex of the Decision, covering most of the Netherlands and Belgium,
all of Luxembourg and areas in the German Lander of North Rhine
Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Hessen. Ruminants and
their semen, embryos and ova, produced after 1 May 2006, cannot be
moved out of the listed areas. Within the surveillance zone, certain
exemptions for transit and domestic slaughter apply, subject to
strict controls.
In addition to the movement ban and measures to be applied within the
defined 150-km zone, the Decision states that, if necessary, Member
States should also apply certain precautionary measures in other
parts of their territories, including additional examinations and controls.
Tests are still ongoing to determine the strain of the virus that
caused the bluetongue outbreaks, and the Commission is in close
contact with all Member States concerned. Spain and Italy are
providing expert assistance to the affected Member States. The
situation will be reviewed again by the Standing Committee next week.
The Commission will now formalize the decision as quickly as
possible, but Member States are invited to apply its provisions with
immediate effect. For more information, see:

[Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a member of the _Orbivirus_ genus of the
family _Reoviridae_. Within the genus, there are 14 serogroups. The
BT serogroup contains 24 serotypes. The former are differentiated by
immunological tests that detect viral proteins that are conserved
within each serogroup. Most serogroups appear to be immunologically
distinct, but there is considerable cross-reaction between members of
the BT and EHD serogroups. The serotype of individual viruses in each
serogroup is identified on the basis of neutralization tests.
Serotyping of the BTV strain(s) involved in the current BTV outbreak
is essential to enable the selection of the appropriate vaccine
needed urgently to minimize losses. Five serotypes have been
identified in southern Europe since 1998, namely BTV 1, 2, 4, 9, and
16. Preferably, homologous vaccines should be used. It will be
interesting to note whether the current strain is one of the 5. If
affirmative, appropriate vaccines are expected to be immediately
available. If, against expectations, the strain is found to differ
from the European strains, vaccine might be sought at the
Onderstepoort laboratory, which produces multivalent BTV vaccines.
The laboratory methods prescribed for the identification of the virus
are described in detail in chapter 2.1.9 of OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals, available on-line at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00032.htm>.
Phylogenetic tree analyses of BTV isolates based on the sequence of
RNA2 have been performed by the BT BBSRC reference laboratory at
Pirbright. Comparison of the 5 European Serotypes of BTV genome
segment 2 NT sequences, last updated 22 Jan 2004, is available at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/european-btv-seg-2.htm>.
