[Since August 2020, Russia has reported cases of HPAI subtype H5N8 in both poultry and wild birds. To date (5 Oct 2020), 50 outbreaks have been reported in poultry and 9 in wild birds. See event summaries and updated maps at:
- HPAI H5N8 in poultry: https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=35477
- HPAI H5N8 in wild bird:

For this new HPAI event from Russia, the neuraminidase has not yet been typed. It is highly likely that these new cases are caused by HPAI H5N8. Determining the subtype and strain of this virus is very important. - Mod.CRD
