From: Steve Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

I have no data per se...but an anecdote. During 1975 to 1976, we (NY VA
Hospital) were told of a patient with axillary lymphadenopathy and fever -
found to have tularemia. The man worked in the fur industry on 7th Avenue,
and thus created much excitement. As it turned out, he was also a hunter
(I believe muskrats) and had probably acquired the infection [outside the
city.

[Steve also suggested I contact various people in New York City but none of
them could provide data, which makes me think there are no data. John Marr
recalls tularemia activity in Suffolk County (Long Island) in the
mid-1970's in native Americans.
Until we receive hard facts on this subject, this string is cut. If you
have not read "Manhattan: A tropic isle?" by Harry Most, former President
of the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (AJTMH
17:333-354, 1969), I recommend it. - Mod.CHC
