[Classical swine fever (CSF)is an important disease of swine and seems to occur on a regular basis in Guatemala. There were no cases reported to OIE WAHID in 2005 but there was one outbreak of CSF in both 2007 and 2008. Again, in 2009 there were no outbreaks but in 2010 there was a single outbreak and 2011 saw a spike in outbreaks with 11 outbreaks occurring that year.

In Central America, only Belize and Costa Rica have consistently reported no cases to OIE WAHID database since 2005. So unfortunately, we can expect to see outbreaks of varying severity and expanse to occur on a regular basis. Given the losses often associated with CSF disease and the necessity to slaughter animals in order to effectively control spread of the disease within a location, the epidemiology of this disease in Central America should be given attention and progress in prevention strategies would be most helpful.
