The P&O ship Fair Princess failed to meet requirements to inform health or
quarantine authorities of an outbreak of illness on the ship before it
docked in Sydney on 25 May 1999.
The cruise ship, which is at the centre of a national typhoid alert, landed
knowing that 120 of the 900 passengers on board had been afflicted with
severe diarrhoea, abdominal cramping and vomiting, or a range of other
symptoms.
A spokesman for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service said last
night that all ships or aircraft entering Australia were required as part
of their clearance process to report any infectious diseases before they
landed. The service's requirements "refer to illnesses of an infectious
nature. You've got to work out whether gastroenteritis is considered an
infectious illness or not." The spokesman added: "We would have expected
there would have been notification. However, we're investigating the
matter."
P&O's senior general manager, Ms Sue Drinkwater, said that, at the time,
the company believed the symptoms were due to gastroenteritis, or food
poisoning, contracted on a visit by 153 passengers and crew to the Kokoda
Track.
But an on-board doctor who accompanied the Kokoda tour told the Herald last
night that the nature of the illness could not be established because there
was no pathology service on board. Dr Neal Finegan said that typhoid,
salmonellosis and _E. coli_ infection, as well as giardiasis and
cryptosporidiosis - the diseases involved in last year's Sydney water
contamination - were all possible candidates.
Three people were confirmed by the Federal health department yesterday as
having typhoid. The chair of the Communicable Diseases Network of Australia
New Zealand, Dr Graham Rouch, acknowledged that more cases were likely to
be diagnosed. Dr Rouch said the tour's doctor, Dr Finegan, was also
suspected of having the disease. So were at least three others who were on
board.
