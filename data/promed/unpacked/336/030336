KANGAR: Health officers at the Malaysian-Thai border checkpoint in
Padang Besar have been put on alert following reports that a rare
disease spread by rat urine has reportedly killed 22 people in
Thailand.
Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Shahidan Kassim said yesterday health
officers would monitor the situation.
"We will not allow anyone detected with the disease to enter the
country as it is contagious," he said after chairing a state exco
meeting.
Shahidan was commenting on a Bernama report on Tuesday that cases of
leptospirosis, spread by rat urine which killed 22 people in Thailand
last month, was on the rise in Singapore.
It takes about 10 days for the symptoms to show and within two weeks,
it can develop to jaundice, meningitis and kidney and liver complications.
Shahidan said initially, the disease might be construed as flu as the
symptoms included fever, chills, headache, muscle ache and cough.
There might also be rashes, neck stiffness and mental confusion, he
said, adding those with such symptoms should seek treatment
immediately.

[Good luck to them trying to control the entry of a disease that has
a 10 day incubation period & starts off looking like flu --
especially as it is endemic in Malaysian rats anyway. In fact the
only places free of lepto are the polar regions!
Note the mention of reports of cases in Singapore - Mod.JW
