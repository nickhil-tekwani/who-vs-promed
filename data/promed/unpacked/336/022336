In an update on the plague cluster in Ituri Province in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), UN officials report a total of 31 cases and 8 deaths since the beginning of 2019.

The 1st 5 cases were reported during week 10 in the Aungba health zone, which is in an endemic area. Two other cases were reported during week 13 (Aru health zone) and 14 (Aungba health zone). The latest cluster of cases was reported between week 39 (7 cases and 3 deaths) and 40 (14 cases) from Aru health zone in Ituri Province.

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium, _Yersinia pestis_. It is found in animals throughout the world, most commonly in rats but also in other rodents like ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, rabbits and voles. Fleas typically serve as the vector of plague.

People can also get infected through direct contact with an infected animal, through inhalation and, in the case of pneumonic plague, person to person.

_Y. pestis_is treatable with antimicrobials if started early enough.

There are 3 forms of human plague; bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. - Mod.LL
