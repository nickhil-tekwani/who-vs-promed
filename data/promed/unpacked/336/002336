Malaria, Dominican Republic: Update
-----------------------------------
As of 4 Feb 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has
received reports of 20 cases of malaria in travelers to resort areas of the
Dominican Republic.
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria has been confirmed in 4 patients from the
United States, 6 from Canada, and 10 from European countries, all of whom
had recently traveled to areas of the Dominican Republic where malaria had
not previously been reported. All returned home between 3 Nov 2004 and 2
Jan 2005.
CDC continues to recommend that all travelers to La Altagracia Province,
including the Punta Cana resort area, should take an antimalarial drug
(prophylaxis). In addition, an antimalarial drug is recommended for
travelers to rural areas throughout the country. Chloroquine is the
recommended drug for the Dominican Republic.
Antimalarial drugs taken correctly and consistently, along with other
measures to prevent mosquito bites, have been shown to be effective in
preventing malaria. Therefore, CDC does not discourage travel to
malaria-endemic countries. However, CDC has rescinded recommendations for
malaria prophylaxis for Duarte Province because no new cases have been
reported from the area in the last 2 months, the epidemiologic
investigation by the Ministry of Health of the Dominican Republic did not
reveal any new cases, and their surveillance system did not detect any
cases of malaria in the province in recent years.
Infection with the type of malaria found in the Dominican Republic, _P.
falciparum_, may rapidly result in a severe, life-threatening illness if
not promptly treated. The Ministry of Health in the Dominican Republic has
implemented malaria control measures, including intensified surveillance,
prompt case management, and intensive mosquito control activities.
Visit the CDC Health website for information on malaria risk and
prevention in the Dominican Republic.

[This report adds 3 new cases in returning tourists, one from the United
States and 2 from Europe. The risk therefore seems still to exist, and
single prophylaxis with chloroquine is still recommended. - Mod.EP]
