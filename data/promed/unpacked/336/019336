Children in Angus taken ill with _E. coli_
------------------------------------------
A number of children in Angus [Scotland] have been taken ill with suspected _Escherichia coli_ O157 [infection], health chiefs have confirmed. NHS [National Health Service] Tayside said the outbreak in the region is linked to Errington cheese. A 3 year old child died earlier in September 2016 after being infected with a strain of _E. coli_ O157 linked to Dunsyre Blue cheese in July 2016. A playgroup in Carnoustie had temporarily closed voluntarily while the incident is being investigated.

Parents of pupils attending a local primary school in the town have also been issued with a letter with advice from the board's health protection team. NHS Tayside consultant in public health medicine Dr Daniel Chandler states in the letter: "You may be aware that NHS Tayside and Angus Council are currently investigating cases of suspected and confirmed _E. coli_ O157 infection affecting children in the Angus area. Possible sources and routes of transmission are currently being investigated, and necessary control measures have been put in place to prevent further spread.

"Those affected continue to be monitored, and have received appropriate medical treatment and advice." NHS Tayside said the children affected by the bacterium were being monitored and had received medical treatment. Possible sources of the microbe and "routes of transmission" were being investigated with measures being put in place to prevent further spread. Parents have been advised to look out for symptoms including diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea and/or vomiting.

[This post says both that "NHS Tayside said the outbreak in the region is linked to Errington cheese" and "possible sources of the microbe and routes of transmission were being investigated". The statements seem to be contradictory. ProMED-mail awaits further confirmation that these new cases in Angus are genetically linked to the unpasteurized cheese-linked cases. - Mod.LL
