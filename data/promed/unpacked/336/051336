The UK Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF) tonight confirmed that 27 pigs found
with vesicles in an abattoir near Brentwood, Essex, have Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMS). A veterinary inspector from the State Veterinary Service,
undertaking routine inspections, raised the alarm after visiting the
abattoir on 19 Feb 2001. A movement restriction zone, 8km in diameter and
affecting all farm livestock, has been instituted around the abattoir. The
infected pigs are said to have arrived at the abattoir on 16 Feb 2001 from
farms in Buckinghamshire and the Isle of Wight. A movement restriction
zone, 8km in diameter, has also been placed around a farm at Great Horwood,
Buckinghamshire.
Vesicles (skin blisters) are a well-known symptom of FMD, but also Swine
Vesicular Disease (SVD). FMD can also affect cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.
The FMD virus produces blisters in the mouth area, sometimes causing
profuse salivation. Blisters (vesicles) can also appear on the feet and
result in lameness. Death is not usual, but affected animals cease gaining
weight and in dairy cattle milk production can fall. The last outbreak of
FMD in the United Kingdom was in 1981 and the most recent outbreak in the
European Union was in Greece in July 2000.
