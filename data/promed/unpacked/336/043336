The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has announced a new human
case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The case is a 21 month old
girl from the 6th of October Governorate, Kerdasa District, whose symptoms
began on 9 Jan 2009.

She was initially hospitalized on 10 Jan 2009 and is currently in a stable
condition. Infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus was diagnosed by
PCR at the Egyptian Central Public Health Laboratory and subsequently
confirmed by the US Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) laboratories.

Investigations into the source of her infection indicate a recent history
of contact with sick and dead poultry. Of the 52 cases confirmed to date in
Egypt, 23 have been fatal.

The 6th of October Governorate was carved out as an independent governorate
from Giza governorate by Presidential Decree No. 114 of 2008. Originally
designed by the state as a cooperative to alleviate crowdedness in major
cities, the 6th of October Governorate is located 38 km from Cairo. It is a
big industrial and residential city and the most important center of
university education in Egypt. - Mod.CP
