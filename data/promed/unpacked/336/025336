Turkey: 5 New Suspected Human Cases of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
5 additional people have tested positive for avian influenza in
preliminary lab tests in Turkey, the Health Ministry said on Monday
[9 Jan 2006]. The announcement raised to 15 the number of suspected
cases detected in Turkey since Wednesday [4 Jan 2006], including 3
deaths. It was not immediately clear whether the 5 new cases,
detected in 4 separate provinces, were the deadly H5N1 strain. Health
officials cautioned that the H5N1 strain so far has only been
confirmed in humans who were in close and prolonged contact with fowl
but said they were monitoring the virus for fear it could mutate into
a form easily transmissible among humans and spark a pandemic.
On Sunday [8 Jan 2006], officials reported 3 new cases in Ankara and
2 cases in the eastern city of Van, about 600 miles away. The cases
in Ankara include 2 brothers, aged 5 and 2, who tested positive for
H5N1 in preliminary tests by Turkish labs, along with a 65-year-old
man. They were the 1st suspected cases outside Van. The boys
apparently caught the virus while playing with gloves that their
father had used to handle 2 dead wild ducks outside Ankara, their
doctor Metin Dogan said. The boys did not appear sick despite testing
positive for the virus, Dogan said.
A 15-year-old girl and her 14-year-old brother from the eastern town
of Dogubayazit died of the disease last week [1st week January 2006],
the 1st humans outside East Asia to succumb to the deadly strain that
has apparently been spread by migratory birds. A 3rd sibling also was
believed to have died of bird flu, but the World Health Organization
has not confirmed the cause of death. A British laboratory,
meanwhile, confirmed the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus in a
5-year-old Turkish boy, while preliminary tests in Turkey detected
the strain in an 8-year-old girl. Both children are in intensive care
in Van. Another brother and sister in Van also were found to be
positive for H5N1 in preliminary tests, Health Ministry official
Turan Buzgan said.
Birds in Turkey, Romania, Russia and Croatia have recently tested
positive for H5N1, which killed 74 people in East Asia.

Turkey: New Human Cases Reported in Black Sea Provinces
-----------------------------------------------
The [H5N1 avian influenza] virus has been identified in 5 more people
across Turkey, a local health official said on Monday [9 Jan 2006],
while 21 people were being tested for the disease in Istanbul, the
country's largest city. Health Ministry official Turan Buzgan told
the state-run Anatolian news agency there were new human cases in the
Black Sea provinces of Kastamonu, Corum and Samsun and the eastern
province of Van.
The 1st case of the virus jumping from birds to humans outside China
and southeast Asia occurred last week [1st week January 2006] in
rural eastern Turkey, where 3 children from the same family died
after contracting the H5N1 strain. Turkey has now reported 12 people
as suffering from H5N1 avian influenza virus infection, in addition
to the 3 youngsters who died. However, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has confirmed only 4 cases in Turkey, including 2 deaths. The
WHO said other cases had not so far been verified by laboratory tests.
The children who died last week [1st week January 2006] almost
certainly caught the virus directly from chickens, officials say.
World health authorities worry that human exposure to the bird flu
virus could lead to the emergence of a mutation, allowing easier
transmission between humans and raising the prospect of a global pandemic.
Turkey said on Sunday [8 Jan 2006] that 3 people from villages in the
Ankara region had tested positive for the virus, the farthest west
that any case of avian influenza in humans has been reported, and the
latest stage in an apparent advance towards major economic centers in
Turkey and Europe.
4 children have also tested positive for the H5N1 strain in the city
of Van, about 800 km (500 miles) east of Ankara, the local
authorities said. 21 people in the Istanbul area are in hospital amid
fears they have bird flu, newspapers said on Monday [9 Jan 2006],
raising concern that the deadly disease has spread to Turkey's
commercial hub of 12 million people. If any of the tests are
positive, it would mark the 1st time that human cases of a disease
that originated in China and southeast Asia have been reported so far west.
Istanbul is about 400 km (250 miles) west of Ankara, Turkey's densely
populated commercial and tourism hub, and marks the gateway to
Europe. Health authorities expected to receive test results on the 21
people on Monday [9 Jan 2006], the Milliyet daily said. 14 of them
were from the same family. Istanbul municipality was planning a news
conference on Monday [9 Jan 2006]. Istanbul province deputy health
director Mehmet Bakar said initial tests on 2 dead chickens in the
Istanbul district of Kucukcekmece indicated they were infected by the
bird flu virus, the reports said. A 3rd test was being carried out to
determine the definitive diagnosis.
"The 21 people under suspicion (of having bird flu) have been kept in
hospital under observation. Samples have been taken from these people
and sent to the laboratory for examination," Bakar was quoted as
saying in Star newspaper. Officials were not immediately available to
confirm the reports.

5 in Turkey Infected with H5N1 Virus: Official
-----------------------------------------------
At least 5 people, 3 in Ankara and 2 in Van, have tested positive for
the potentially deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus and are
under treatment, a Turkish governor health official said on Sun 8 Jan
2006. Turan Buzgan, head of the health ministry's Basic Health
Services, told the Anatolia news agency that the 5 were among
specimens from 28 people tested so far at a government laboratory in
Ankara. This brought to 9 the total number of people infected with
H5N1, the most virulent form of the virus, since the outbreak began
last month [December 2005]; 2 of the 9 have died.
A health official in Corum, 240 km (150 miles) east of here, said
that a 5-year-old boy was also hospitalized with the bird flu, but
the chief physician of the hospital in nearby Cankiri, where the
child is being treated, denied this and said final test results had
not yet been received.
Ankara Governor Kemal Onal told Anatolia that 2 children and an adult
were hospitalized in the capital, and Buzgan identified the 2 at the
Van hospital in eastern Turkey as a 9-year-old girl and a 3-year-old
boy. He said both were from Dogubeyazit, near the border with Iran,
where 3 children from the same family died during the past week [1st
week January 2006]; tests were inconclusive concerning the death of a
3rd sibling.
The 2 children in Ankara are from the town of Beypazari, 100 km
(about 60 miles) northwest of the capital, where 2 wild ducks were
found dead from the bird flu in a reservoir 2 days ago.
