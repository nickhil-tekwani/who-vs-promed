- No new confirmed cases notified.
- No new deaths.
- 1 new person healed in Beni.

News of the response
Social mobilization
--------------------
- On Sat 22 Sep 2018, nearly 500 nurses from the health zones of Beni, Oicha, Mabalako, Masereka and Vuovu [North Kivu] marched in the city of Beni to show their support for the response to the epidemic of Ebola. They went to the town hall of the city of Beni where they held a conference on the prevention of intra-hospital contamination by Ebola virus disease. As a result of the large number of nurses who became infected and died of Ebola during this epidemic, nurses in the affected areas pledged to be more compliant with hospital infection prevention and control measures to avoid this kind of infection and tragedy in the future. In addition, they gave the Coordinator of the Riposte, Dr. Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, a letter of thanks to the Minister of Health for all the efforts made by them to quickly contain the epidemic.

Vaccination
-----------
- The vaccination of the 1st contacts of the confirmed case of Tchomia began this Sat 22 Sep 2018. So far, 56 contacts have already voluntarily registered with vaccination teams.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 11 109 people have been vaccinated, including 4014 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3536 in Beni [Norht Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 734 in Butembo [North Kivu], 573 in Katwa [North Kivu], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 164 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

The health zones of Butembo and Katwa are 2 neighboring areas in the town of Butembo. Given the regular movement of contacts in these areas, it is sometimes necessary to reclassify vaccinated contacts back to their original health area after verification of vaccination data. This explains why the cumulative number of people vaccinated in Butembo is lower than the cumulation reported in the previous bulletin. These contacts have been reclassified to Katwa.

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 20 Sep 2018:
- A total of 147 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 116 were confirmed and 31 were probable.
- Of the 116 confirmed, 68 died and 39 are cured.
- 11 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases including 3 in Beni and 1 in Tshomia (Ituri).
- 2 confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni and 1 in Tshomia (Ituri).

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- A new confirmed case has been reported in the Tshomia health zone, 50 km [31 mi] from Bunia, Ituri province. This case was a known contact of the 1st confirmed case reported in the district of Ndindi, in the city of Beni. It is around this community death that the pockets of resistance in this neighborhood crystallized. After the death and unsecured burial of this woman in Ndindi, some of her family members refused to cooperate with the response teams, resulting in several confirmed cases and deaths in the same family. When these people started to become symptomatic, they hid or fled to other health areas, including Mabalako, Masereka, Butembo, and Tshomia. Thus, all the 1st confirmed cases in these areas are direct contacts of the case of Ndindi district.
- In all these areas, the coordination sent intervention teams in the 1st 24-36 hours of the notification to quickly identify and vaccinate the contacts around these different cases. These rapid interventions are necessary to rapidly break the chain of transmission related to Ndindi's resistance.
- On Fri 21 Sep 2018, a joint team was deployed to the Tshomia health zone. This mixed team consisted of vaccinators, epidemiologists, psychologists, communicators, experts in infection prevention and control, an emergency physician, and a logistician.

Vaccination
-----------
- On Thu 20 Sep 2018, 4320 additional doses of vaccine arrived in Kinshasa.
- Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 10 944 people have been vaccinated, including 3980 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 3455 in Beni [North Kivu], 1632 in Mandima [Ituri], 844 in Butembo [North Kivu], 413 in Katwa [North Kivu], 270 in Masereka [North Kivu], 164 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu], and 65 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[This emphasizes several important points: the need for safe burials, the importance of vaccination of contacts, and the risk of spread from exposed unvaccinated individuals leaving the area. For these reasons, a single case can lead to a new cluster of cases in a previously clean area, even when the outbreak appears to be ostensibly under control. - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak status still active
Date: Sat 22 Sep 2018
Source: Xinhua News Agency [excerpted, edited]
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-09/22/c_137485012.htm


The World Health Organization (WHO) said Fri [21 Sep 2018] that the latest Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) remains active, with the cities of Beni and Butembo becoming the new hotspots.

Substantial progress has been made to limit the spread of the disease to new areas, and the situation at Mabalako health zone in Mangina, North Kivu province, is stabilizing, WHO said in a statement.

In the meantime, response teams continue to enhance activities to mitigate potential clusters in Beni and Butembo -- 2 large, populous cities in the province -- and prevent spread to other areas.

Significant risks for further spread of the disease still remain, the WHO warned. Continued challenges include contacts lost to follow-up, delayed recognition of Ebola in health centers, poor infection prevention and control in health centers, and reluctance among some cases to accept treatment in Ebola treatment centers.

The priority thus remains strengthening all components of the public health response in all affected areas, as well as continuing to enhance operational readiness and preparedness in the non-affected provinces and neighboring countries.

The WHO said that as of Tue [18 Sep 2018], it had deployed 209 experts in the DRC to support response activities. Among them are emergency coordinators, epidemiologists, laboratory experts, logisticians, clinical care specialists, communicators, and community engagement specialists.

Over 5000 Ebola contacts have been registered, of which 1983 remain under surveillance.

Meanwhile, 10 701 people have so far consented and been vaccinated, including 4008 healthcare or frontline workers, and 2362 children. The ring vaccination teams are currently active in 3 health areas in North Kivu and one in neighboring Ituri province.

As the latest Ebola outbreak is affecting northeastern provinces of the DRC, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan, the WHO emphasizes that national and regional spread remains high and that it is important for neighboring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities.

Although an overall decreasing trend in weekly case incidence continues, it has to be interpreted with caution, given the expected delays in case reporting and the ongoing detection of sporadic cases.

[3] Uganda
Date: Sat 22 Sep 2018
Uganda Radio Network [excerpted, edited]
https://ugandaradionetwork.com/story/bunyoro-on-tension-as-ebola-case-is-reported-in-tchoima-


Health officials in Bunyoro sub region have intensified their health surveillance network following the reported case of Ebola at the Tchomia landing site in Ituri Province on the shores of Lake Albert. The Tchomia landing site in Ituri is the closest landing site to some districts in Bunyoro.

On Fri [21 Sep 2018], Ituri province Vice Governor Keta Upar said in a statement that the latest Ebola case had been reported in Tchomia on the shores of Lake Albert.

Tchomia is one of the busiest fish markets in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo that attracts several Ugandan businessmen from the landing sites of Butiaba, Walukoba, Kijangi, Kaiso, Sebigoro, Nkondo, Ndaiga, Ntoroko, Kyehoro, and Fofo from the districts of Hoima, Buliisa, Kikuube, Ntoroko, and Kagadi to transact fish business in the market.

Ugandan businessmen cross to Tchomia Market on a weekly basis posing a big threat that the disease outbreak could easily be reported in Uganda if the movements of the businessmen are not regulated. Tchoima fish market operates every Thursday.

Dr Fredrick Byenume, the Hoima district Health Inspector, warns the public to be vigilant and report any suspicious cases to the nearby trained health personnel deployed along the shores of Lake Albert.

Byenume told URN on Saturday [22 Sep 2018] that the district is currently training 70 surveillance officers who are to be deployed along all the landing sites in the district to carry out surveillance services.

He says that next week the district health department will embark on training of case management personnel who will be equipped with all the necessary techniques of handling Ebola cases.

Dr James Olowo, the Kagadi District Health officer - DHO told URN that the district has deployed a team of health officers in all the landing sites that are currently doing surveillance and screening of Congolese Nationals entering the district. He says the district health department has also embarked on mass-sensitization of the public on how they could detect and report all Ebola cases.

Simon Agaba Kinene, the Buliisa LC5 Chairperson says since Buliisa is one of the districts that is at the border point with the DRC, the district leaders have teamed up with health officials to conduct mass-sensitization and screening of those entering the district from DRC through the Lake Albert waters. He also warns the people of Buliisa and Bunyoro at large to be conscious and immediately report any strange cases to trained health officials.

The situation has been tense at the Uganda-Congo border, with increased surveillance and sensitization drives, since 3 deaths were reported in the city of Butembo, 51 km from the Mpondwe border post. The post is a hub for Congolese mineral exports and imports from East African ports through Uganda.

The World Health Organization said earlier that it was aiding Uganda to set up the "ring vaccination" strategy being used in Congo in order to ensure that the deadly disease does not cross the borders.

[Uganda appears to be taking all the right measures to minimize this very high risk of Ebola being introduced and initiating an outbreak. It is good that the WHO is working with the country to apply the vaccination strategy that has been so successful in these recent outbreaks. - Mod.LK
