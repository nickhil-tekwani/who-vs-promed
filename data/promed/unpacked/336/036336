Amebic meningoencephalitis, primary - diagnostic methods
--------------------------------------------------------
We have been seeing [_Naegleria fowleri_] meningoencephalitis for the past 5-6 years particularly during the summer months.

In 2013 after an intensive campaign to ensure chlorination of piped water supply the number of cases declined significantly. However the number of cases has risen again this year [2014]. 6 of these cases were diagnosed at Aga Khan University Clinical Laboratory. Diagnosis was made on the basis of microscopy on wet preparation using un-centrifuged CSF and culture (with enflagellation) in all cases. Molecular testing was also used on 2 cases. All cases are routinely notified to the relevant Health Department.

In 2010 CSF samples were sent to CDC Atlanta for confirmation (Sadia Shakoor et al: Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis Caused by _Naegleria fowleri_, Karachi, Pakistan. Emerg Infect Dis. 2011; 17(2): 258-61; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3204751/).

[ProMED-mail thanks Rumina Hasan and Afia Zafar for the additional information. It would be good practice to confirm the microscopy with molecular methods. The important point is to maintain a high degree of suspicion for primary amoebic encephalitis. - Mod.EP
