1. In ProMED-mail Digest # 180 of 13 July, Professor Tuan-Gee Yap, quoting
the "journalist report" of 9.7.98, presents the case of a Polish
epidemiological study of diabetes type 1 as an example of evidence of
strong relationship between epidemic of enterovirus infections and
subsequent rise of diabetes incidence rates.
Authors of this study, results of which were published in 1987 in Diabetes,
36:106, stated however that:
"Reasons for the epidemic of IDDM are not known. Although enteroviral
epidemics preceded period of increased diabetes incidence by several
months, no direct evidence was available for cause-and-effect relationship"
(this is the quotation from the final version of paper approved for
publication, as I am not able to get now the reprint from Diabetes, 1987).
Perhaps it would be useful to have an opinion of Dr. M. Rewers, who was the
author of the paper and principle investigator of this study. Later he
worked for a few years with Dr. R. E. Laporte, University of Pittsburgh,
but I am not sure where in U.S. is he now.
2. In ProMED-mail Digest # 181 of 14 July, Professor Mc Laughlin discussed
the role of antigen exposure in the etiology of chronic diseases. In this
context I would like to reiterate, that enterovirus infection is probably
one of the factors in the complex etiology of diabetes type 1, but as of
today there is no convincing scientific justification behind the
statement, that "diabetes.....is caused by a virus".
