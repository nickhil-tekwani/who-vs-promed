Minister of Health Dr. Hubert Minnis confirmed yesterday [20 Apr
2010] that one reported case of dengue fever was discovered in New
Providence 2 weeks ago. The last time a case of the virus was
reported was in October 2003, when 2 cases were reported. Prior to
that, there was an outbreak in 1998 with 25 cases of dengue fever,
said Dr. Minnis.

"We've had one case of dengue fever that we've picked up which was in
the end of March [2010]. That individual is doing very well," said
the health minister. When asked why he was just speaking about the
case 2 weeks after the discovery, Dr. Minnis said officials were
working to obtain all the facts on the case.

Dr. Minnis said the ministry was particularly concerned in light of
the outbreaks of dengue fever and related deaths unfolding in the
Dominican Republic. According to the Dominican newspaper, Dominica
Today, to date there have been nearly 2000 cases of dengue fever
registered, and of that number 291 were the more extreme, hemorrhagic
form of the illness, which caused the deaths of at least 14 people.

"We want to be proactive and aggressive to ensure that we don't fall
into that type of category," said Dr. Minnis. "As a result of that we
have ... sent out medical alerts to all of the various physicians to
be on the lookout for those types of symptoms, and we've also
informed environmental health who are aggressively fogging the
various different areas, and in fact fogging the whole of New
Providence, especially since we've had quite a bit of rain recently
(Sunday) [18 Apr 2010], which can [contribute to] breeding grounds
for mosquitoes."

Dengue fever is not contagious, the health minister said. The disease
is spread when an infected mosquito bites another person. The health
minister also said residents should not be alarmed and advised that
all containers with stagnant water be closed up or the water
discarded. Director of Environmental Health Melony McKenzie said: "We
are going to start fogging areas where there is a need. Mostly, we're
concentrating on the larvacidal treatment." She was speaking to
measures to control mosquito populations, and in particular to target
the _Aedes agypti_ mosquito which causes the disease [transmits the viruses].

[It is not clear from this report if the dengue virus infection
mentioned was imported from another country or was acquired locally.
The health authorities in the Bahamas are wise to pursue an
aggressive vector control campaign early on.

This Friday [23 Apr 2010], the 4th dengue death was confirmed this
year in Aracatuba, 513 km [319 mi] from Sao Paulo [city]. The patient
was 35 years old and was admitted to the Santa Casa [Hospital] on 19
Apr 2010. More than 9000 [dengue] cases now have been registered in
the city. This Friday, 2 new deaths caused by dengue with
complications also were confirmed this afternoon [24 Apr 2010] by the
Secretariat of Health of Santos, on the Sao Paulo [state] coast. In
this city, the disease has already claimed 15 fatal victims.
According to the bulletin released this Friday, the city now has 2127
confirmed dengue cases tallied from 1 Jan [2010] - 23 Apr 2010. In
just one week, 266 new cases were confirmed, which represents an
increase of 14 percent. In the Santos lowlands region, there now are
9786 confirmed cases of the disease wit 29 deaths. At least 5 cities
of the region now have confirmed that they are experiencing a dengue epidemic.

The main victims of the dengue epidemic that hit Ribeirao Preto are
young people. Of the 12 223 confirmed cases of the infection as of
yesterday [21 Apr 2010], 4048 people (33 percent) were between 20-34
years of age. The 35-49 year age group are in 2nd place in the list
of infection, with 2772 cases (22.7 percent), according to the
municipal Secretariat of Health. "This age group (20-34 years) is
economically active, moves through various environments, so it is
easier to become infected."

The physician epidemiologist who is Coordinator of the Dengue Control
Program, Claudio Souza de Paula, says that younger individuals are
more susceptible to infection because of the social activities they
are involved in. A young woman of 30 years increased the list of
hospitalized in the Central Basic Health Unit (UBDSC) because of the
disease. Moreover, she is included in the 31 confirmed DHF cases --
the most serious type of the disease -- which has already killed 2
people in the city this year [2010]. Daily, 100 patients suspected of
having dengue arrive at the UBDSC, and on average 25 are confirmed.
"This is a high number that increases daily. We need independent
controls [for age] to see if they are younger individuals or not," he
said. From Tuesday [20 Apr 2010], when the Secretariat confirmed 11
904 000 [dengue virus] infections [transmitted] by _Aedes aegypti_,
until yesterday [21 Apr 2010] , there was an increase of 319 cases.
The Director of the Department of Health Surveillance of Ribeirao
reported that the department is evaluating the 12 223 cases
individually and monitoring the 55 hospital admissions in the city, she said.

<http://oglobo.globo.com/cidades/mat/2010/04/25/casos-de-dengue-crescem-428-em-alagoas-916426520.asp>


Just up to 19 Apr 2010, the reported dengue [cases] have increased
428 percent in relation to the same period last year [2009]. From the
1695 reported suspected cases in 2009, the indices jumped to 7264 as
of the 14th [epidemiological] week of 2010. And worse, DHF loomed by
1140 percent (more than 11 times) in the Helvio Auto Hospital, which
attends about 90 percent of the patients admitted [to hospital] in
Alagoas. The most serious cases, with risk of death, exploded by 850 percent.

Besides the [vector] mosquito infestation levels reaching record
highs, the new cases are multiplying with unprecedented speed, and
the disease is getting severe. Some 10 years ago, patients took
around 3 days to recover from dengue, but today there are cases of
people who spend 3 weeks to almost a month to go through the period
of convalescence. In 2 studies of the situation in the country, the
infectious disease physician Celso Tavare observes that each year
there is a trend and the virus gets stronger [more virulent] ("due to
mutations"), and the patients are more delicate, susceptible to
critical clinical pictures, mainly in those who have now contracted
the disease. The General Manager of the Helvio Auto Hospital, Luciano
Pacheco, added that Alagoas today is experiencing an epidemic within
endemic dengue that creeps unresolved for 25 years. Dengue is more
severe because it reached hyper-endemic transmission. Infectious
disease Professor of the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL) Tavares
explained that the circulation of 3 different types of [dengue] virus
intensifies the effects of the disease, hence the inflation of the
[case] statistics with risk of death.

This year [2010], the Helvio Auto Hospital attended to an increase of
500 percent of dengue patients, and [hospital] admissions increased
by 400 percent. "With each passing day, the patients are in a more
critical situation; this has us very worried," said the infectious
disease physician, remembering that the disease was considered benign
in the decade of the 1980s. "In 1986, there was the 1st outbreak in
the state. It was a fierce epidemic with thousands of cases because
there was no immunity, but the data of that era are not reliable.

The most cruel face of the major dengue epidemic recorded in Alagoas
shows in its new potential victims: children. Up to the past 10 days,
the National Notification System (SINAN) reported 91 confirmed cases
in patients aged 1-14 years. Of these, 16 had DHF, and there were 4
cases of dengue with complications. Of the 252 patients enumerated by
SINAN, more than 38 percent are infants and children. In the same
sample, the age groups 15-19 years have 35 confirmed cases (14
percent), 20-29 years have 51 patients (20 percent), 30-39 years, 33
cases (13 percent). The other ages account for 15 percent of recorded
[cases]. The data also show that children are more susceptible to
severe manifestations of the disease, with 46 percent of these cases.

[Stating that mutations are responsible for increasingly severe cases
in Alagoas is speculative. Relating genetic changes causally to
virulence is always a challenge. Several studies of the genetics of
South American dengue virus isolates have been published recently.
The summary of a 2007 article stated, "A total of 4 243 049 dengue
cases have been reported in Brazil between 1981 and 2006, including
5817 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome
(DHF/DSS) and a total of 338 fatal cases. Although all Brazilian
regions have been affected, the Northeast and Southeast regions have
registered the highest number of notifications. DENV-1 and DENV-4
were isolated for the 1st time in the Amazon region of Brazil in 1981
and 1982. The disease became a nationwide public health problem
following outbreaks of DENV-1 and DENV-2 in the state of Rio de
Janeiro in 1986 and 1990, respectively. The introduction of DENV-3 in
2000, also in the state of Rio de Janeiro, led to a severe epidemic
with 288 245 reported dengue cases, including 91 deaths. Virus
strains that were typed during the 2002 epidemic show that DENV-3 has
displaced other dengue virus serotypes and entered new areas, a
finding that warrants closer evaluation. Unusual clinical symptoms,
including central nervous system involvement, have been observed in
dengue patients in at least 3 regions of the country."

An unprecedented and worrying situation is experienced currently in
some areas of the country, especially in the Central department
[state or province equivalent], due to the simultaneous circulation
of dengue virus serotypes 1, 2 and 3, stated Dr. Eugenio Baez,
infectious disease physician and medical advisor to the
Administrative Council of the IPS [Instituto de Prevision Social -
Social Welfare Institute].

For decades, we have suffered outbreaks of dengue caused by [dengue
virus] serotype 1 and recently by [virus] serotype 3, the [health]
professional said. This year [2010], we add the confirmation of
dengue cases caused by [virus] serotype 2 in Concepcion and Amambay,
and in recent days in various localities in Central department and
neighborhoods in the capital.

[Dengue virus] serotype 2 has had minimal circulation previously, so
that most of the population that is exposed contracts the infection
caused by this virus serotype. On the other hand, [virus] serotype 2
is associated with more serious forms of the disease, especially in a
patient that already has had dengue caused by [virus] serotypes 1 or
3 previously, he cautioned.

The cases reported in Asuncion are presenting with peculiar
characteristics, particularly very high fever (39-40 C [102.2-104 F])
that is very difficult to control, important gastrointestinal
symptoms, mostly diarrhea, and a significant decline in the numbers
of blood platelets that dispose the patients to development of
hemorrhagic complications.

To this are added climatic conditions favorable for the reproduction
of the mosquito vector that transmits the virus and the elevated
rates of larval infestation in the majority of the neighborhoods in
Asuncion and cities in the Central department. Facing this situation
of high health risk for the citizens, more than ever, the necessity
is imposed on all citizens to commit to an intensive campaign for the
eradication of intra-domicile reservoirs of the mosquito vector that
are not affected by spatial fumigation carried out routinely by the
Ministry of Health, the [health] professional underscored.

The municipality has pointed the finger at the Mayor's Office and
called for a new strategy to tackle dengue fever after 94 new cases
were detected in Jeddah last week, bringing the total number of cases
in the 1st 15 weeks of 2010 to 363.

Reports show that despite intensified efforts by the mayoralty in
spraying the city and drafting in emergency teams, dengue has
continued to spread in the south Jeddah districts of Ghulail, Mada'in
Al-Fahd, and Al-Karantina. "The situation will continue as long as
the Misk Lake continues to rise and provide the perfect breeding
ground for dengue-bearing mosquitoes," Akhdar said. "I have
repeatedly voiced my concerns over the imminent public health danger
posed by the Misk Lake, but have had no response." Akhdar also
criticized delays in sewer works that, he said, had resulted in a
"notable increase in insects and rodents."

[This report reflects an unfortunate misconception about breeding
sites of dengue virus vectors -- _Aedes_ mosquitoes -- which in this
case are probably _Ae. aegypti_. This mosquito breeds in and
immediately around buildings, not in lakes or sewers. Vector control
requires surveillance and treatment to eliminate water catchments or
apply larvicides where the vectors are located. Fogging will provide
only temporary vector population reduction.

A 3rd Townsville resident is believed to have contracted dengue fever
after an outbreak was declared in the north Queensland city last
week. Queensland Health says it's awaiting test results on a 3rd
probable dengue fever case in the city after 2 people tested positive
for the virus last week [week of 11 Apr 2010]. The latest case is the
2nd from the suburb of North Ward, while the other recorded case was
at Deeragun. Authorities say the cases do not appear to be connected,
and the origin of the outbreak is still unknown.

The outbreak was declared last week, a month after the city was
declared free of the virus following a previous outbreak in December
[2009]. A spokesman said Dengue Action Response Teams are undertaking
yard inspections and setting traps to kill dengue mosquitoes in Townsville.

In Kuala Lumpur, 4 deaths due to dengue were reported from among the
1639 cases of the disease recorded so far this year [2010] in the
city, Kuala Lumpur City Hall Director of Health Dr Sallehuddin Abu
Bakar said on Sunday [25 Apr 2010]. He said the 1639 cases were
higher than the 1447 recorded for the corresponding period last year [2009].

Dr Sallehuddin appealed to the public to ensure that their homes and
surroundings were free of the potential breeding grounds of the
_Aedes_ mosquito, carrier of the dengue virus.

The places regarded as active breeding areas of the mosquito in Kuala
Lumpur included Cheras, Setapak, Kepong and Jalan Klang Lama, he told
reporters after closing the Communications for Behaviour Impact
(Combi) programme at a flats in Keramat Wangsa here. The 39
participants of the programme were entrusted with ensuring that the
area was free from dengue, besides disseminating information to the
residents on the harm caused by the _Aedes_ mosquito.
