An elk killed recently in the Shirley Mountains north west of Medicine Bow
has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). Bob Lanka, wildlife
management coordinator for the Game and Fish Department in Laramie, said
the discovery of the disease in the infected elk in Hunt Area 16 didn't
come as a surprise. He said animals in 2 other elk hunt areas immediately
to the east and south of Hunt Area 16 also had tested positive for the
disease.
Lanka also said the disease has already been discovered in a few deer there
and in elk in the Laramie area, just east of the Shirley Mountains.
A hunter had killed the elk on 21 Sep 2006 near the Prior Flats Campground.
The Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory detected the disease in the animal
on 29 Sep.
Terry Kreeger, supervisor of the Veterinary Services Branch of the game
department, said the elk killed in the Shirley Mountains could have
contracted the disease from other elk or from deer.
The disease was first detected in Wyoming in the south eastern part of the
state and is spreading in wildlife populations. "We know it (CWD) goes from
white [tail] deer to mule deer to elk," Kreeger said Monday. "Every
direction as far as we know."
The disease has been detected in 10 states and 2 Canadian provinces.
Researchers have found that the disease can spread among animals in both
saliva and blood. Infected animals show no signs for the first 1 to 3
years. But in the later stages of infection, the disease can cause animals
to become emaciated and display abnormal behavior.
Public health officials and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department have
recommended that hunters not shoot or eat animals that appear sick.
Officials say hunters should wear latex gloves as a routine precaution when
field-dressing animals. Hunters should also minimize the handling of brain
and spinal tissues, bone out meat when butchering, and wash their hands
afterward. Scientists say there's been no documented transmission of the
disease to humans from eating infected game animals, or from any other
route. "It's impossible to say with 100 per cent certainty that it will
never happen," Lanka said.
