From: Eleanor Kellon <kell@epix.net>

Dr. Eleanor Kellon poses the following two highly relevant questions.
[1
Does anyone know the total number of positive birds for 2000 nationwide
and/or by state? The Westchester County Health Department site states that
results on the 332 of 2254 dead birds submitted for testing are still
pending. How long does the submission process, gross pathological screening
and PCR testing protocol take? Does anyone have any idea whether 2254
reports of dead birds for one county is excessive? I have lived in rural or
semi-rural settings for the past 20 years but very, very rarely see a dead
bird.
[2
Does anyone have an opinion regarding the USDA's decision not to restrict
movement of horses from areas with an active West Nile virus problem (i.e.
ill/dead horses)? The literature states horses (and lemurs) have a moderate
viremia and may play an significant role in the epidemiology of West Nile
virus infection.

[Dr Kellon and ProMED-mail would welcome responses to these queries. An
unconfirmed report in the July 11 edition of USA Today (Byline Michelle
Healy <betterlife@usatoday.com>), based on statements attributed to Health
Officials in New York and New Jersey, indicated that 16 crows have now
tested positive for West Nile virus; 4 in New Jersey's Bergen County, and
the others in New York's Rockland, Westchester and Suffolk counties. These
positive tests have still to be confirmed officially. At the peak of the
outbreak last year, when there were 62 cases of encephalitis and 7 deaths
in the human population, the number of affected birds totalled thousands.
Dr Charles A. Nichter of Columbia and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital was quoted in
the New York Times of Jul 11 {Byline Eric Nagourney) as saying that
although there is no specific therapy for West Nile virus infection,
alerting physicians to the problems associated with the detection of West
Nile virus might facilitate treatment of patients and assist health
officials in gauging the probable extent of an incipient outbreak.
Presumably statistics are available from the dynamics of bird death during
1999outbreak to allow some provisional prediction ? So far no human cases
have been reported this year - Mod.CP
