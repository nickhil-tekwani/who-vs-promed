The death toll of months-long cholera in war-torn Yemen has risen to 605, with suspected cases exceeding 73 700, the World Health Organization [WHO] said [on Fri 2 Jun 2017]. "Cholera continues to spread in Yemen. Over 73 700 suspected cholera cases and 605 associated deaths have been reported in 19 governorates," WHO said on its official twitter account.

The death toll has rapidly increased 2 days after WHO put the figure at 532 and the number of suspected cases at 65 300 on [Wed 31 May 2017]. The deadly disease has been rapidly spreading across Yemen since [Thu 27 Apr 2017], WHO said. The organization warned that the health care system in Yemen is on the verge of collapse as many hospitals have shut down because of the ongoing conflict, saying only 45 per cent of Yemen's hospitals are operational, and they are facing a shortage of supplies and staff.

The impoverished Arab country in the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula has been locked in a civil war since 2015. The war pits Iranian-allied dominant Houthi movement, backed by forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, against their foe of Saudi-backed government of President Abd-Rabbo Mansour Hadi. The capital Sana'a and most of the northern provinces are under the control of Houthi rebels.

[2] Cholera vaccine comment
Date: Fri 2 Jun 2017
From: Timothy Herrick <timrage00@yahoo.com> [edited]

Reports on cholera have mentioned Dukoral but failed to mention Vaxchora which I believe is the same vaccine but licensed in the USA.

ProMED-mail thanks Timothy Herrick for his comment on cholera vaccine. I inadvertently left out the paragraph on the newest cholera vaccine, the 1st licensed in the USA, which is from the same reference - Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press):

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64).

"62. Freedman DO. Re-born in the USA: another cholera vaccine for travelers. Travel Med Infect Dis. 2016;14: 295-296.
63. Qadri F, Wierzba TF, Ali M, et al. Efficacy of a single dose, inactivated oral cholera vaccine in Bangladesh. N Engl J Med. 2016;374: 1723-1732.
64. Azman AS, Parker LA, Rumunu J, et al. Effectiveness of one dose of oral cholera vaccine in response to an outbreak: a case-cohort study. Lancet Global Health 2016;4: e856-e863."

This new vaccine is not the same as Dukoral or Shanchol as it is a live, attenuated biologic instead of inactivated and is suggested for one dose only immunization - Mod.LL
