[The July 2005 outbreak in pheasants, in Surrey, was caused by avian
paramyxovirus, serotype 1 lineage 5B; molecular sequencing showed a
virulent sequence. A similar virus strain was identified in a pheasant farm in
Loire-Atlantique, France, regarded as the source of infection. - Mod.AS]

Newcastle disease - latest
-----------------------------
Following the confirmation of Newcastle Disease (pigeon variant) in East
Lothian, the State Veterinary Service has completed slaughter on the
infected premises, and work on cleansing and disinfection has started.

In line with the EU requirement for a stamping out policy, approximately 14
000 birds, principally grey partridge [_Perdix perdix_], have been culled.

The premises contained a number of rare species of high conservation value.
Following a thorough veterinary risk assessment of the premises and
considering most carefully several factors, including their contribution to
global biodiversity, it has been possible to exempt a number of the rare
species subject to stringent biosecurity and containment conditions.

While the control and eradication of disease is paramount, this exemption
is a unique response to the international significance of the rare species
involved, a number of which are considered globally endangered. These
special arrangements have therefore been developed on the basis of
veterinary judgment and ornithological advice.

These birds will be vaccinated, tested and kept under quarantine conditions
for 60 days under strict biosecurity. They will also be subject to daily
veterinary supervision. These special arrangements will not endanger
disease control.

Restrictions on the movement of poultry and hatching eggs within the 3-km
Protection Zone and 10-km Surveillance Zone remain in place, and poultry
keepers continue to be reminded of the importance of good biosecurity and
vigilance for signs of disease. Any suspicion should be reported to the
State Veterinary Service immediately.

Restrictions will be lifted on the Protection Zone 21 days after the
completion of primary cleansing and disinfection, and the Surveillance Zone
will be lifted 9 days later. This is subject to inspection of poultry
holdings in these areas and no further incidence of disease.

Avian influenza was ruled out at early stage of this incident. Newcastle
disease does not present a significant risk to human health.

Background

Newcastle Disease PMV1 (Pigeon Variant) has been confirmed in partridge on
Fenton Barns Farm, Northern Berwick, East Lothian. The isolate has been
placed in Linage 4b and groups with current European and previous UK pigeon
isolates.

Pigeon PMV1 infection is known to exist widely in our feral pigeon
population. Spill over infection into commercial poultry flocks are
uncommon. In any case, Newcastle Disease vaccination is widely practiced in
the UK poultry industry and is a very effective preventative measure.

Newcastle Disease is principally spread by the oral/ fecal route. This
means that, if exceptional biosecurity is practiced in a farm situation
with suitable indoor containment facilities i.e. farm quarantine, it is
possible to prevent disease spreading from a limited number of housed
birds. While the epidemiology of Newcastle Disease in rare species of birds
is largely unknown, there is no reason to suggest that the disease is any
different to that seen in domestic birds. As a consequence, those diseased
birds which recover eliminate the virus and do not become carriers. If 60
days have elapsed with no clinical signs, and the birds are tested to
ensure that there is no virus present, they may be safely released from
farm quarantine.

The EU Newcastle Disease Directive requires the culling of poultry in an
infected flock on infected premises. EU legislation permits specific
derogations for rare species where this can be justified by veterinary risk
assessment.

The veterinary risk assessment suggests that whilst all birds on the
premises are likely to have been exposed to disease, the specific
biosecurity arrangement for the conserved rare birds will minimize the risk
of disease spread.

[Details of the vaccines used, the vaccination schemes (including
revaccinations and their timetable) applied in the various bird species
involved, and results of the anticipated post-vaccination serological
follow-up are of significant value for similar possible future disease
events elsewhere and will be welcomed.

Newcastle Disease PMV1 (Pigeon Variant) was also the virus involved in the
July 2005 outbreak in pheasants in Surrey.
