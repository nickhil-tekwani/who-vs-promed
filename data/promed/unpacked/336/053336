surveillance programme, Chungcheongnam-do Veterinary Research
Institute tested the samples (faeces and laryngo-pharyngeal swabs)
collected from ducks in the farm located in Changso-ri, Yesan-gun,
Chungcheongnam-do on 5 Oct 2010. Haemagglutination test results were
positive on 15 Oct 2010. The National Veterinary Research and

[South Korea last reported Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1)
in May 2008, which was on a fairly large scale encompassing 33
outbreaks. They had previously reported H5N1 on a smaller scale in
2006 and again in 2007. So it is critical that South Korea do
surveillance for HPAI in poultry and this surveillance has turned up
a Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza, H7N7.

This is not the 1st time an LPAI has been discovered in South Korea
with another H7N7 being reported in May 2010, an H5 being reported in
2009, and an H5N2 being reported in 2008 which are just a few
examples. Thus, the discovery of an LPAI is no surprise and in fact,
there have been over 50 new LPAI outbreaks between January and June
of 2010. LPAI usually only manifests with subclinical disease as
appears to be the case here. The importance of surveillance for HPAI
and the reporting of LPAI when discovered was emphasized by OIE
change in standards in 2005 to require the reporting of LPAIs over
and above the standard, high mortality HPAI outbreaks.
