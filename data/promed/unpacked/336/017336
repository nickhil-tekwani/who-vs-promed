Two Portuguese microbiologists took to Portugal a sample of an unknown
epidemic disease that is actually being observed in some children in
Luanda, with an aim to make a genetic study and identify the disease.
The information was given to Angop by the director of Luandaoes Pedriatic
Hospital, Luis Bernardino, mentioning that the illness can be caused by an
infectious agent that invades the arterial wall causing a paralyzation in
the blood.
The symptoms presented are hard nails and the paralyzation of some superior
or inferior members.
According to the pediatrician, at the moment 11 cases were registered in
the hospital, 2 of [whom] need amputation.
The official considered as "Worrying" the situation, because in most cases
the little ones contract the illness after being interned in the hospital,
that leads the parents to blame the doctors.
The affected children are isolated, since the illness can be contagious.
Luis Bernardino denied rumors that the children have died in the pediatric
hospital because of the illness, explaining that the causes of death were
similar to the symptoms of the unknown disease.
He defended that the Health Ministry need to and explain the disease.
Precautions taken, Luis Bernardino stated that the sanitary technics are
being advised to manipulate the vein the minimum possible, during serum
application.
Thirty four cases of the disease were registered in the same hospital, last
year.

[It is difficult to speculate what might be going on here other than
possible IV site septic thrombosis. This newswire is confusing mentioning
arterial wall involvement and then venous serum application. Hence, the
best way to handle this is to request further information from any
subscribers in either Angola or Portugal who may have some technical
information on this reported outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
