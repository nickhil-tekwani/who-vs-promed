I am somewhat surprised by the level of the Breteau Index (BI) mentioned in
the account from Brazil in the Dengue/DHF Update 2006 (13) 20060403.0999.
According to Ms. Rosalicia Maria Lundstedt, R.N., the highest tolerable
index for a municipality is 1.99 in order not to have dengue transmission.
According to the WHO definition, this index is the number of positive
containers (i.e. containing _Aedes aegypti_ larvae) per 100 premises
inspected. In this case the threshold given seems very low: in some
countries BIs higher than 100 are not exceptional.
I was wondering whether in this case they had interpreted the BI as the
number of positive containers per house inspected; however, if this was so,
the threshold seems far too high. Is there any explanation for this?
Another question. Besides _Aedes aegypti_, _Aedes albopictus_ is also
present in Brazil. Does it occur in the neighboring countries mentioned here?

[There are several larval indices that have been proposed to measure larval
populations of _Ae. aegypti_ in epidemiological studies on dengue/DHF and
yellow fever, but the following are the most widely used.
1) House or Premise Index. The percentage of houses, including
examinations of surrounding compounds, that have larvae of _Ae. aegypti_ in
at least some containers.
2) Container or Receptacle Index. The percentage of water-holding
containers that contain larvae of _Ae. aegypti_.
3) Breteau Index. The total number of containers with larvae of _Ae.
aegypti_ per 100 houses.
In 1973 WHO tried to simplify matters by correlating these various
indices; they introduced density figures (1-9) which corresponded to
ranges of the above 3 larval indices. For example, a density figure of 5,
representing a House index of 29-37, a Container index of 15-20 and a
Breteau index of 35-49, was in the case of yellow fever taken to indicate a
threat of urban transmission.
However, these density figures have rarely been used and the most widely
used index is the Breteau Index. But in a recent study in Brazil (Morato,
V. C. et al. (2005), 39; 553-558) while both the House and Breteau indices
were often zero or close to zero, the container index was sometimes as high
as 11 percent. The authors concluded that in their study the Container
index was the best indicator of _Ae. aegypti_ larval population size.
There are clearly difficulties in interpreting the various larval indices.
But I agree with Dr Guillaumot: that in the above-quoted Dengue/DHF Update
describing the dengue situation in Penapolis, Brazil, the Breteau indices
of 2.28 and 5.14 seem quite low. I was also surprised to learn that a
Breteau index of 1-3.9 is considered by Ms. Rosalicia Maria Lundstedt, RN,
as a dengue alert.
As regards _Aedes albopictus_, as Dr Guillaumot says, it is found in
Brazil, but it has also been reported from Argentina, Colombia, and Bolivia
as well as from several Central American countries.
We would welcome further clarification on the _Ae. aegypti_ larval indices
used in Penapolis, Brazil, and also whether _Ae. albopictus_ has been
recorded in other South American countries. - Mod.MS]
