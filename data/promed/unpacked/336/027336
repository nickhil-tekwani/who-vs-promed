KAMPALA, Uganda: The last known patient in Uganda stricken by the Ebola
virus was given a clean bill of health Tuesday and discharged from the
hospital. Dr. Sam Okware, head of the National Ebola Task Force, said the
elderly
woman had recovered from Ebola [infection after being hospitalized in the
northern
town of Gulu.
"We are really almost at the end of the epidemic," Okware said. He said
173 of 426 Ebola patients died and that health officials do not know of any
additional cases.
While in past Ebola outbreaks up to 90 percent of victims died, Ugandan
doctors and international health experts have been able to save 60 percent
of the patients by using aggressive rehydration therapy.
The Uganda outbreak of Ebola was first identified in October [2000 in
Gulu, 225 miles north of the capital, Kampala. Other cases were soon
discovered in 2 other districts.
The Ebola virus is spread by contact with body fluids. An outbreak is
considered over after 2 incubation periods [of 21 days each have passed
with no new cases reported.
"In Masindi district, no new case has been recorded over the past 41
days. Masindi is to be declared Ebola free tomorrow," Okware said. "For
Gulu, the countdown started on 14 Jan [2001 and if no new case is recorded
by 24
Feb [2001, it will also be declared Ebola free."
Ebola outbreaks are rare and no one knows where the virus lives when not
infecting humans.
