Dengue cases continue to climb and have now reached 98 934 cases or 135 per
cent higher than the same period last year [2009] covering the months of
January to 25 Sep [2010], the National Epidemiology Center (NEC) of the
Department of Health (DoH) reported on Monday [11 Oct 2010].

Last year [2009], there were only 42 075 nationwide. But health officials
are still optimistic that cases will decline in the coming weeks. A total
of 644 deaths were also registered within the same period [in 2010].

[2] Viet Nam

Despite a 6.3 per cent drop in the number of people infected with dengue
fever over the same period last year [2009], the disease has been growing
more complex in different areas since the beginning of this year [2010].
According to the Department for Preventive Health and the Environment, by
early October [2010], Viet Nam has had around 80 000 cases of dengue fever,
and 59 people have died of the disease, 9 per cent higher than last year's
[2009's] death toll.

As in previous years, dengue fever is often seen in southern provinces, but
the central and central highland regions have now become "hot spots" for
the disease. The number of infected people in some central and central
highland provinces is more than 21 600, up 168 per cent compared with the
same period of last year [2009].

It is worth noting that the number of patients with more serious problems
has increased sharply due to the widening circle of the disease; a dengue
fever epidemic broke out in the northern region last year [2009].

[The situation of the dengue epidemic in Viet Nam continues to be
complicated (see prior PRO/MBDS postings listed below). The reported number
in 9 months in 2010 for the country as a whole has decreased. However, it
has increased in the central and the highland central regions. Both the
number of deaths due to dengue and the number of serious problem in 2010
have increased compared with the same period in 2009.

These trends and differences might be due to the changes in the dengue
surveillance system -- that is, a better system might be detecting more
cases of dengue in highland central and central Viet Nam; severe cases or
deaths are easier to report than less severe cases. PRO/MBDS would
appreciate comments from a knowledgeable source on this moderator's assumption.

According to the WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO)
report, available at <http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/>, a
total of 12 868 cases and 12 deaths were reported in Viet Nam during 2010,
as of 15 Jun 2010. During 2009, a total of 105 370 cases and 87 deaths from
DF/DHF were reported in Viet Nam.

Health authorities say 13 people have been diagnosed with dengue fever in
Cairns in far north Queensland.

12 people from the inner city suburb of Parramatta Park have now been
diagnosed with the mosquitoborne illness. Another case has been confirmed
at nearby Cairns North. Teams of Queensland Health and council workers have
inspected and sprayed hundreds of properties in the inner city area.

Medical entomologist Joe Davis says the Paramatta Park residents are all
suffering from type 2 dengue [virus] fever, but the north Cairns resident
has a different [dengue virus] strain, type 1. "The good news is that we
don't have any more suspect or pending cases and no new onset of illness
since the treatment has been in effect, which is good news," he said.

[The 8 Oct 2010 edition of the New Scientist
(<http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827812.400-antidengue-mosquitoes-to-hit-australia-and-vietnam.html>
reported that mosquitoes infected with bacteria that stop them from
transmitting the dengue virus will be released into the wild next year.

Scott O'Neill of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia and
colleagues have found a fruit-fly bacterium called _Wolbachia_ that infects
_Aedes_ mosquitoes and makes them less able to carry the dengue virus. It
also halves their life span, which is crucial, as only older insects
transmit virus. _Wolbachia_ is passed on through the eggs of infected
females, so only descendants of the released mosquitoes will carry it,
O'Neill says. But dengue-free descendants should rapidly dominate, as
Wolbachia-infected females have a competitive advantage: they can reproduce
with infected or wild males, and wild females cannot. Infected mosquitoes
will be released in Australia and Viet Nam.

Success of this approach will rest on the _Wolbachia_-infected mosquitoes
being able to compete with or even out-compete uninfected individuals in
nature. The results of the field trials is awaited with considerable interest.

[4] Germany ex Croatia
Date: Fri 8 Oct 2010
From: Martin Haditsch <m_haditsch@syscomp.de> [edited]


This is to notify colleagues, especially those involved in travel medicine,
infectious diseases in general, and vector borne diseases in detail and
official bodies involved in public health, of the 1st case of dengue fever
acquired in Croatia*.

History: A 72 year old male from Thuringia/Germany fell sick after holidays
in southern Croatia (region Orebic, Korcula and Dubrovnik). He had
experienced mosquito but no tick bites and 2 stings by wasps as well. He
reported not to be vaccinated against yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis,
and TBE, and had not suffered West Nile fever or dengue fever previously.

One day after return (18 Aug 2010), for 3 days, he became febrile (39 C
[102 F]) with chills, headache, aching joints, pain in the eyes, and a
burning skin sensation. After a short period of improvement, he got another
attack of fever up to 38.8 C so he asked his general practitioner (GP) for
a visit. The patient presented with conjunctivitis and was suspected of
having an incipient pneumonia as well. A questionable erythema could not be
verified due to his tanned skin. Checks for meningitis, edema, and
hematuria were all negative and the ECG was normal. Due to his complaints,
including muscle and joint pain, fatigue and the fever charts, the visiting
doctor (Dr Monika Reichmann, a GP with special training in travel medicine)
included dengue in the serological check-up despite the fact that Croatia
up to now has not been included in the list of countries where dengue is
endemic.

Blood was tested on the 23 and 30 Aug [2010]. The serological tests done in
various laboratories (Labor Schottdorf MVZ GmbH, Augsburg, Labor An der
Salzbr Bocke MVZ GmbH, Ritschenhausen), including confirmation tests in the
Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, were negative for _Mycoplasma
pneumoniae_, Coxsackie virus, sandfly fevers (Naples, Sicily, Toscana),
West Nile virus, and legionella. In the 1st test, besides a leucopenia (3.1
g/L) and a thrombocytopenia (97 g/L), serology was positive for dengue
[virus] IgM and negative for dengue [virus] IgG. In addition, the dengue
antigen test revealed a positive result. Seven days later, dengue serology
showed the typical course of seroconversion (IgG and IgM positive).

Taking the clinical symptoms and all the test results (by ruling out most
of possible cross reactions in serology), this case seems to be the 1st
documented patient having acquired dengue fever in Croatia ever, and in
this part of Europe since the 1st quarter of the 20th century, respectively
(1927/28 last big dengue epidemic in Greece). This should lead to further
investigations on the patient and those family members who had joined him
during the holidays and who also had slight symptoms (but had not had a
blood check). This report should perhaps lead physicians to include dengue
in the differential diagnoses in similar situations, which may result in
the detection of further cases. Furthermore, health authorities in Croatia
should be encouraged to do epidemiological studies in the regional human
and mosquito populations.

* Of course the European Centre for Disease Control was notified as well
(Schmidt-Chanasit J, et al: Dengue virus infection in a traveller returning
from Croatia to Germany; sent 1st Oct 2010).

Kunstmann (Labor An der Salzbrucke MVZ GmbH, Ritschenhausen), Stefan Kopf
and Felix Stelter (Labor Schottdorf MVZ GmbH, Augsburg), Jonas
Schmidt-Chanasit and Stephan Gunther (Bernhard Nocht Institute, Hamburg),
Irene Schoneberg, Klaus Stark, and Christina Frank (Robert Koch-Institut,
Berlin), but most of all Monika Reichmann; without her sharp and critical
mind, this case would not have been detected.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Haditsch for sending in this interesting report. It
is essentially the same information that the authors published in
Eurosurveillance 2010; 15(40), 7 Oct (rapid communications).
(<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19677>).

With the invasion and establishment of _Aedes albopictus_ in southern
Europe's Mediterranean Basin, this species is the suspected dengue virus
vector in this case. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving any
additional information about dengue virus transmission in Croatia as it
becomes available. This is an outstanding example of a pathogen that turns
up in a country where it is not believed to be present. The clinician who
put dengue virus infection on the rule-out list was perceptive, indeed.
With ecological changes around the world and the movement of introduced
pathogen vectors, such as _Ae. albopictus_, we can expect future surprises.

Puerto Rican officials say heavy rains unleashed by a tropical storm could
worsen a dengue epidemic that has led to a record 26 deaths in the United
States Caribbean territory. Health secretary Lorenzo Gonzalez says that
nearly 900 cases of dengue have been reported in recent weeks, and he
worries that the number could increase. Roughly 12 000 cases have been
reported so far this year [2010]. In 1998, the virus killed 19 people and
sickened 17 000.

Of all the Departments of Honduras, only the Bay Islands, Comayagua, Copan,
La Paz, and Ocotepeque have reported no deaths from DHF. Although the onset
of the disease, considered hyper-endemic, seems to have slowed, victims are
still being reported. The weekend confirmed 2 more deaths, raising the
death total from the disease to 74 so far this year [2010].

Of the 74 dead, 44 lived in the capital. The total number of cases of DHF
is 2551; after last week, there were 129 new confirmed cases. 89 suspected
DHF cases were ruled out.

The past week, there were 1060 new cases of the classical dengue fever
type, bringing the total number of patients in 2010 to 64 228. Half of the
patients are registered in the Central District.

In June 2010, between [epidemiological] weeks 30-33, which was the apex of
the classic cases, up to 6000 patients a day were confirmed. According to
Health [National Health Surveillance], the numbers of people affected by
dengue continues to decline.

The state Secretariat of Health released a news bulletin about dengue cases
in Paraiba. According to Health Surveillance, this year [2010], 4391 cases
of the disease were confirmed for epidemiological weeks 1-39 (January-2 Oct
[2010]).

There has been a fivefold increase [of dengue] case numbers compared with
the same period last year [2009], when 722 cases were confirmed. In the
state capital, the increase reached 578 per cent, passing [last year's
(2009) cases] of 116 cases, reaching 786. Of the 4391 confirmed cases of
dengue, 4314 were classical dengue fever cases, 50 were dengue with
complications, 24 were DHF, and 3 were dengue shock syndrome [DSS]; 3
deaths were registered.

Last year [2009], there were 709 cases of classical dengue fever, 3 of
dengue with complications, 9 of DHF and one of DSS. There was one death.
