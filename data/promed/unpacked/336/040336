AMPHIBIAN DIE-OFFS & INFECTIOUS AGENTS

A perspectives article in the upcoming edition of the CDC journal "Emerging
Infectious Diseases" (EID) reviews two diseases causing amphibian mass
mortalities associated in some cases with population declines.
Amphibian populations declines have been noted on a global scale over the
past 2 decades. Many are probably due to habitat loss, although declines at
rain-forest sites in Central America and Australia have remained
unexplained. These include a number of extinctions, e.g. the golden toad of
Costa Rica and 2 species of gastric brooding frog in Australia.
Various causal hypotheses have been proposed, including UV-B (Ultraviolet
B) increases, pollution, global warming and disease. The EID article
reviews the role of a fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, identified in 1998
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA. 1998, Vol. 95: 9031-9036) as the cause of
amphibian mass mortality in Central America, Australia (including the near
extinction of _Taudactylus acutirostris_) and the USA, with the first
published reports of a number of recent outbreaks.
It suggests this pathogen has a heightened impact due to persistence in the
environment, some species are particularly susceptible due to their
specialized ecology, and the disease has been introduced into naive
populations of amphibians in pristine rainforest areas, although it may
occur as a natural parasite of other amphibians. The paper collates
published and unpublished data on ranaviruses (members of the Iridoviridae)
- the cause of recent mass die-offs of amphibians in the UK, USA and Canada
(see previous postings on ProMED-mail).
Outbreaks seem to be associated with habitats already affected by humans
(farmland, artificial ponds etc.), where population densities may be
particularly high. Some ranaviruses cause very high mortality rates in
experimental infections and, although the overall impact on amphibian
populations is still not known, some die-offs involve many hundreds of
individuals.
An integrated program of work is underway to investigate further outbreaks
of these two diseases, test hypotheses on the causes of their emergence and
assess the potential role of environmental factors in their emergence.
