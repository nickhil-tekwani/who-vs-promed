White-nose syndrome, a fungal disease that affects hibernating bats, has been confirmed in Nebraska. Several dozen dead bats were discovered during a recent survey of a mine in Cass County. The U.S. Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, confirmed the disease in 3 bats from the mine -- a little brown bat, a northern long-eared bat and a tri-colored bat.

Nebraska is the 30th state to confirm the presence of white-nose syndrome, which has killed more than 6 million bats since 2006. The disease also has been confirmed in 5 Canadian provinces. "Finding bats with white-nose syndrome in Nebraska emphasizes the need to develop and implement new tools to manage the spread and reduce the severity of the impacts of this devastating disease," said Jeremy Coleman, national white-nose syndrome coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

White-nose syndrome affects bats during hibernation, causing the animals to awaken more often and use up fat reserves they need to survive through winter. They may also emerge from hibernation too early and starve or freeze to death. Mortality rates for little brown and northern long-eared bats have exceeded 95 percent in some states.

Bats are crucial to a healthy ecosystem. They eat insects that can damage agricultural crops, saving U.S. farmers at least 3 billion USD annually in pest-control services. A total of 4 bat species known to use mines in Nebraska are susceptible to white-nose syndrome: little brown, big brown, tri-colored, and northern long-eared bats. Indiana and northern long-eared bats are protected under the Endangered Species Act.

White-nose syndrome is not known to pose a threat to humans, pets or livestock.
