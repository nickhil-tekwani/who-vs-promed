Updated risk areas for tick-borne encephalitis in Germany
---------------------------------------------------------
In its issue of 4 May 2009, the Epidemiologisches
Bulletin of the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI),
Germany, published an updated map of the risk
areas for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in
Germany. TBE risk areas are areas in which TBE is
endemic and where, in agreement with experts, a
risk exists for people exposed to ticks that
justify preventive measures. Such measures
include vaccination for locals exposed to ticks,
for tourists travelling to risk areas and people
with occupational exposure. The updated map shows
that there is a risk of contracting the TBE virus
through tick bites in the southern parts of
Germany, in particular in the states Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria,

The TBE risk map is based on cases mandatory
notification of TBE cases reported to the RKI in
the period from 2002 足 2008. In this period there
were 1917 TBE cases notified in total with the
annual number ranging from 238 to 546 cases and
288 cases notified in 2008. 5-year reporting
periods (2002 足 2006, 2003 足 2007, 2004 足 2008),
were used to generate 5 year TBE incidences at
the district level. To minimize the probability
of underestimating the risk of infection in a
particular district with increasing vaccination
coverage, the number of reported cases in the so
called district region, consisting of the
district in question plus the adjacent districts,
was created. A district was defined as a risk
area if the incidence in the district or the
district region was significantly (p-value
greater than 0.05) higher than 1 per 100 000 inhabitants over a 5 year period.

In 2008, 136 districts were classified as TBE
risk areas, 4 of them for the first time:

-- 42 districts in Baden-Wurttemberg (1 additional district);
-- 78 districts in Bavaria (3 additional districts);
-- 8 districts in Hesse (unchanged);
-- 7 districts in Thuringia (unchanged); and
-- 1 district in Rhineland-Palatinate (unchanged).

The accompanying report summarises the TBE risk
according to federal state as follows:

-- federal states with defined TBE risk areas:
Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate, Thuringia;
-- federal states with isolated cases of
autochtonous TBE, in which no district fulfils
the criteria of a TBE risk area: Brandenburg,
Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Lower Saxony North
Rhine-Westpfalia, Saarland, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt
-- federal states in which no TBE cases have
been diagnosed: Schleswig-Holstein, Hamburg, Bremen, Berlin.

Furthermore, it mentions that a slow but steady
extension of the TBE risk areas in the past years
is mainly limited to the southern federal states.

Surveillance and reporting of TBE cases are seen
as the most efficient and cost effective basis on
which to base preventive measures. However,
should the incidence of cases drop due to the
increase in vaccination, supplementary indicators
for the risk of capturing TBE may become
necessary in the future according to RKI. In this
context, data on vaccination coverage,
establishment of systematic surveillance of the
number of ticks, the ratio of ticks carrying the
TBE virus or the number of animals infected, become important.

Based on the above mentioned epidemiological
criteria, the German Standing Vaccination
Committee (STIKO) recommends TBE vaccination for
people who live in districts where the risk of
exposure to ticks is established. Vaccination
against TBE is recommended by the local health
authorities in Baden-Wurttemberg, regardless of
district (only 2 districts are not classified as risk areas).
