Campers contract malaria in far north Queensland
---------------------------------------------------------------
In Queensland's far north, 3 cases of malaria have been detected. It is the
first outbreak in the region since 1986.
The Tropical Public Health Unit says the particular strain is a non-life
threatening form of the mosquito-borne illness. Spokesman Dr Jeffery Hanna
says the source has been traced to a single camping area. "These 3 people
camped overnight earlier in the beach at Noah Beach, north of Mossman, and
we're sure that's where they picked it up," he said.
"The mosquito involved is not a mosquito that's found commonly around
built-up areas. It's not an urban mosquito, and for that reason we don't
believe it poses much of a public health threat to north Queensland."

Locally acquired _P.vivax_ malaria, North Queensland, Australia
-----------------------
The Queensland Health Tropical Public Health Unit in Cairns, Queensland,
Australia, is investigating 5 cases of _P.vivax_ malaria that were
apparently acquired whilst camping at a national park in Far North
Queensland in early October 2002. The 5 cases were in 3 different parties
of campers; they camped at Noah Beach, north of Cairns, between 3-12 Oct
2002. In the same party, 3 cases slept in the open; their accompanying 5
children slept in a tent and they remain well. Although there were reports
of considerable numbers of mosquitoes at the campsite at the time, none of
the 5 used mosquito repellants; their companions who used repellants remain
well.
A traveller who had been in Africa early in 2002, and who had confirmed
_Plasmodium.vivax_ following a trip to Indonesia in 2001, was at the Noah
Beach campsite for 4 nights in late September 2002. He was unwell during
this time, and was diagnosed as having _P.vivax_ (with gametocytes) the day
after leaving the campsite.
Given the current minimum ambient temperature in Far North Queensland, any
Anopheles mosquitoes that became infected after feeding on the traveller
would have been able to infect people at the campsite from about 8 Oct
2002. Trapping at the campsite on the evening of 31 Oct 2002 revealed
considerable densities of _An.farauti_ breeding in 2 creeks, one to the
north and the other to the south of the campsite. The northern creek was
the more prolific breeding site; 2 of the 3 parties camped at the northern
end of the campsite. Mosquito control measures, as appropriate, were
undertaken.
There were many other campers at Noah Beach at this time (i.e., the first 2
weeks of October 2002). Registration details provided by the campers reveal
that a considerable number were visitors from overseas. We would be
grateful for details of any other cases of _Plasmodium.vivax_ malaria that
were apparently acquired whilst camping at Noah Beach, Far North
Queensland, in early October.

Health authorities confirm two more malaria cases
-------------------------------------------------------
In far north Queensland 2 more cases of locally-acquired malaria have been
confirmed by health officials. Yesterday 3 cases were reported in the
first outbreak of the disease on Queensland's northern mainland since 1986.
Dr Jeffrey Hanna, from the Tropical Public Health Unit, says it is believed
all 5 patients caught the disease from mosquito bites while camping at a
beach near Mossman early last month.
Dr Hanna says there is little risk of malaria spreading into the wider
community."The mosquitos that were infectious earlier in October 2002 would
have died off by now just through natural attrition," he said."To have
another generation of cases we'd need some people living there to act as
reservoirs and because the nature of the campsite is people don't stay
there more than a couple of nights."

[This outbreak is very similar to the cases of malaria that occurred
recently in Virginia as cited below. In both cases the presumed source was
some one who was from or had traveled in a foreign country. In this case a
specific individual is suspected as the initial source, as he was ill with
subsequently diagnosed malaria. In the Virginia outbreak there was no
obvious initial source; however, travellers from _Plasmodium vivax_-endemic
countries may carry gametocytes in their blood for weeks and if immune may
be completely asymptomatic. An appropriate vector mosquito can transmit the
disease to others. - Mod.DK]
