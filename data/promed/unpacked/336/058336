With summer on the way, health experts are warning of a possible increase
in the number of malaria cases in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the south of
the country, as happened in 2002.
"We are concerned. I think that we will face malaria again this year
[2004]. We have got local contraction of malaria, our mosquitoes are
already infected, and this year again there will be problems," Nurbolot
Usenbayev, deputy head of the epidemiological department at the Kyrgyz
Health Ministry, told IRIN from the capital Bishkek on Thursday.
"We are trying to do something but the problem remains." Rossitza
Kurdova-Mintcheva, a World Health Organisation (WHO) consultant, told IRIN
from the southern city of Osh, where WHO maintains a field office to
coordinate efforts to fight malaria, that the situation with regard to
malaria this year would greatly depend on the measures taken, the weather
and mosquitoes. "There are a lot of factors impacting this process, but I
don't exclude the possibility that there could be an outbreak, because,
looking at present climatic conditions they are more favourable in
comparison to [2003], when there was a decrease of malaria morbidity in
Kyrgyzstan. The weather this year is warmer than last year," she said.
Their comments followed a statement on Tuesday by the Kyrgyz Health
Ministry, saying that, as of 25 May 2004, 15 cases of malaria had been
registered in the country, of which 13 were in the south. The ministry
blamed intensive migration and economic relations with several countries
with endemic malaria, the situation with malaria in neighbouring
Tajikistan, the unsatisfactory state of irrigation and drainage systems,
and an increase in rice plantations in the vicinity of settlements.
According to the Health Ministry, there were around 470 registered
indigenous cases of malaria in 2003, while in 2002 that figure stood at
some 2750. "Last year winter was cold and there was an early spring, so the
season was short, but this year it is already hot. And in May, the first
cases of malaria occurred," Usenbaev explained, adding that, according to
meteorologists, summer [2004] was expected to be hot and autumn last
longer, possibly prolonging the breeding season for mosquitoes -- vectors
of the disease from infected to healthy people.
"Those infected last year underwent radical treatment and were treated once
more in the spring. Therefore, mosquitoes should get infected [only] from
probable infected persons -- local citizens or foreigners coming from
malaria-endemic countries. That's why it is difficult to say whether there
will be an outbreak or not," Kurdova-Mintcheva added.
The Health Ministry said that all those patients, more than 400 people who
contracted malaria in 2003, had undergone preventive treatment in March
2004. There haven't been any new cases to date, the WHO official
maintained, adding that the 15 recent cases were from last year, either
with a longer incubation period or recurring cases of the disease.
But, according to Usenbayev, there could still be infected people --
carriers of the disease among the population -- and the disease could be
propagated by mosquitoes showing up this year. "But I think that they [new
cases] will appear soon and it wouldn't be a surprise, as malaria is an
endemic disease and it takes years to eradicate it," Kurdova-Mintcheva
said, adding that new cases may occur especially in Batken province's
Leylek and Ka-damjay districts, by malaria having come from Tajikistan.
"The epidemiological investigation showed that the indigenous malaria cases
in Batken were related to Tajik citizens who came from Tajikistan, while in
Kadamjay there were ethnic Kyrgyz people who came from Tajikistan as well
and settled in the region of Min-chinar, Ak-kalpak and Akturpak. They
became a source of infection," she said. Given a lack of resources, health
officials face challenges in averting the risk of malaria. The most serious
problem is a dire need of insecticides to control mosquitoes. "We lack
[funding for purchase of] insecticide, and we need at least 3 metric tons
of it every year to treat the mosquito breeding places. Now we don't have a
mere kilo of insecticides, and we are hoping for assistance from WHO.
Perhaps they will help us this year like they did last year," Usenbayev noted.
But according to the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which
has been sponsoring the WHO project on malaria in the country, Kyrgyzstan
was about to get a certain amount of insecticides in the forthcoming weeks.
But experts said the USAID programme on malaria was likely to be finalised
by June 2004, which could seriously affect the anti-malaria efforts in the
impoverished ex-Soviet republic.
Furthermore, most of the medical equipment in the country dates back to
Soviet times, making it difficult to conduct effective diagnostic tests.
Laboratory equipment, including microscopes, dyes and glass slides, was
urgently needed to conduct effective tests on detecting malaria, Usenbayev
noted, adding that insecticide sprayers were also needed.
The UK-based NGO Merlin is expected to provide a number of mosquito nets
and microscopes for the southern region of the country in an effort to
prevent malaria. Meanwhile, Sabyrjan Abdikarimov, head of the sanitary and
epidemiological department, urged the population to be on the alert and
avoid mosquitoes and consequent malaria by using various protective measures.

[ProMED is closely following the malaria situation in the previous Soviet
republics in Asia and commented extensively on the rise of malaria in
Kyrgyzistan in 21 Aug 2003 (Malaria, autochthonous - Kyrgysztan: RFI
20030821.2102). The present data indicate that many of the new cases are
imported from Tajikistan. The WHO Regional Office for Europe has published
a map of authochthonous malaria cases officially reported in 2002 in
Kyrgyzstan clearly showing a high number of cases in the southern provinces
bordering Tajikistan.
