The World Today - Wed 12 Nov 2003 12:23:05
------------------------------------------------
Queensland health officials are preparing for more cases of dengue fever,
following an outbreak in the Torres Strait; 2 Yam Island women are
critically ill in a Cairns hospital with symptoms of haemorrhagic fever, a
potentially fatal form of the disease. Health authorities are trying to
stop the outbreak from spreading to Thursday Island and the North
Queensland mainland before the wet season sets in.
Dr Jeffrey Hanna from the North Queensland Tropical Public Health Unit has
just returned from the Torres Strait. Yam Island has been cleansed of the
offending mosquito, but 18 people have tested positive for dengue and many
more people are awaiting results of blood tests. Australia hasn't seen
cases this severe for a century and health authorities are trying hard to
stop it spreading.
"Looking back historically, I'm not aware of any severe, any cases as
severe as these for perhaps 100 years in Australia," said Dr Hanna. "To
date in North Queensland, certainly in the last 10 years, we've had large
outbreaks but the cases have been relatively mild. But suddenly, on a small
island, we have seen 2 people who have had life-threatening critical
illness requiring intensive care management...
"The large outbreak we had in Cairns this year started in January [2003],
went through to July, over 450 confirmed cases, very mild cases
fortunately, and we know that started off with a traveller from Papua New
Guinea...That outbreak in Cairns was dengue Type 2. Once you've had one
strain you won't get that one again. So the people who have had this year's
outbreak, the 450-odd people who have had dengue in Cairns this year, they
had dengue type 2, and we also know that the Yam Island dengue is dengue
type 2.
"The risk really of it spreading to the mainland is probably not great
because most of the travel so far has been to Thursday Island. If it gets
established on Thursday Island that will increase the risk to the mainland,
because there's a larger population on Thursday Island, and of course they
move to, for example; Cairns, there's direct flights from the adjacent
island, the airport island of Horn Island to Cairns on a daily basis. So
that would increase the risk."

Dengue is back in the port city, already claiming one life and attacking
many more, after a major outbreak about 2 years ago. A young housewife died
of dengue at Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on Sunday, and 5
other dengue patients including a doctor are under treatment, hospital
sources said. A number of dengue patients were reported to be admitted to
private hospitals and clinics and many visited private medical
practitioners for treatment. Sultanul Alam said dengue spread with the
proliferation of Aedes mosquitoes following recent rains in the city.
Spraying of insecticides at breeding grounds for mosquitoes will be geared up.

At least 73 people have died of hemorrhagic dengue fever this year [2003],
according to the national epidemiology institute. Director Luis Lara said
that although the cases still need to be investigated in order to confirm
the cause of death, the mortality rate seemed high. He felt the number of
cases and consequent deaths to be "worrying, but not alarming," and advised
people to be watchful for symptoms, which include fever, aching head and
body, bleeding gums and nosebleeds, and blood in vomit. Anyone displaying
such symptoms should be hospitalized immediately, said Lara. He described
the situation as an outbreak rather than an epidemic.
This year [2003] 4430 cases of dengue fever have been reported in total --
twice as many as in 2002. The reported cases of hemorrhagic dengue have
also risen, from 78 last year to 189 so far in 2003.
