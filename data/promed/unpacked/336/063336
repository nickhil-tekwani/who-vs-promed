Holland America's Zuiderdam has been hit by an unusually large outbreak of
what appears to be norovirus [infection], the flu-like stomach bug that
causes diarrhea and vomiting. More than 12 per cent of passengers on board
the vessel -- 224 out of 1820 -- came down with the illness during a 17
night voyage that ended on Monday [10 Nov 2008], according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] in Atlanta. It's the 1st time this
year [2008] that an outbreak has surpassed 10 per cent of passengers on a
ship, a rare occurrence.

CDC says Holland America has sent additional staff to the Zuiderdam to help
clean and disinfect it. The line also delayed the ship's departure on
Monday [10 Nov 2008] to allow for extra cleaning. CDC officials boarded the
ship Monday, and CDC is now testing stool samples to determine whether the
outbreak is indeed norovirus.

Holland America has struggled with gastrointestinal illness this year
[2008] on its ships, with 6 outbreaks documented by CDC. Only 2 other lines
have had more than one outbreak: Norwegian Cruise Line (4) and Princess
Cruises (2). Three other lines -- Carnival, Regent Seven Seas, and American
Canadian Caribbean Line -- have each had a single outbreak. Holland America
also led the industry in gastrointestinal illnesses in 2007 with 5
outbreaks (tying with NCL) and in 2006 with 7 outbreaks, according to CDC
statistics.

Sometimes called the "24-hour flu", norovirus is the commonest cause of
stomach illness in the United States, accounting for around half of all
cases, according to CDC. It breaks out regularly in schools, nursing homes,
hospitals, offices, and other places where people congregate.

[This report is a reminder of the particular vulnerability of cruise ships
to outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis, almost always due to norovirus
infection. The prevalence of norovirus infection in the northern hemisphere
increases with the onset of winter, and the density of passengers on board
cruise ships favors the spread of the virus. Passengers contemplating a
winter cruise may take mild reassurance from the statement in this report
that it is rare for more than 10 per cent of passengers to be affected. -
