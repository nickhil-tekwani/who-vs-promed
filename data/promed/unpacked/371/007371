Re: ProMED-mail Rabies, rabbit - Thailand: (Bangkok), human exposure 20120805.1229375
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There is now a documented case of rabies in one male rabbit and a probable 2nd one that was not proven. The rabbits became rabid about 7 months after being purchased from a Sunday market in Bangkok; thus animals got infected at the home of the victims, not on the market. After the death of one, the other 2 became aggressive biting at least one owner. There was considerable delay in starting post exposure treatment since rabies in rabbits was not considered likely. This lead to much anxiety after the diagnosis was later laboratory proven in the 2nd animal.

There are many rats around there and also some cats.

The Bangkok post article [see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120805.1229375] stated that this was the 1st case of rabies in a rabbit reported in Thailand. Not quite correct. The Queen Saovabha Institute (Thai Red Cross Society) had another case some 10 years ago. A pet rabbit was observed having been attacked by a large rat and later died of laboratory proven rabies. There were no human exposures in this case, but the local health officers mounted a vigorous rat elimination effort in the district where the case occurred.

Rat rabies, the most likely origin of both cases, is extremely rare: only 2 proven rat rabies cases have been identified among tens of thousand suspect animals tested for rabies in Bangkok. All of these must be considered "spillovers" from dogs or cats and do not represent likely causes of new epidemics in a new species.

Interestingly, one day later, a swimmer in the United State was attacked and bitten by a beaver who was later found positive for rabies (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120805.1228835). Another unexpected spillover event that points out that strange things can happen.

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) is conducting random checks at pet shops out of concern for a possible outbreak of rabies among the seemingly harmless pets.

The concerns have been growing after infected rabbits recently came down with rabies at a Bangkok home and bit their owners.

According to the Thai Red Cross Society's Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute, more than 400 000 people across the country seek treatment for rabies each year, mostly because of cat or dog bites.

"We are investigating the source of the rabies infection in the rabbit," Deputy Bangkok Governor Malinee Sukvejvorakij said yesterday [6 Aug 2012]. She said the infected rabbits had bitten 5 people.

[SP] and her family had suffered from the rabbit bites. Yesterday [6 Aug 2012], they called on the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute to ask for further advice. "We have received anti-rabies vaccinations [details will be appreciated. - Mod.AS] but we have still developed low fevers. We are worried," she said. She said she could not understand how the rabbit kept at home could have been infected by rabies.

The institute's veterinarian Channarong Mitmoontak said that after the vaccination, [the woman] and her family members would certainly face no fatal threat.

The institute's assistant director, Dr Teerapong Tantawichien, advised bitten pet owners to clean their wounds immediately with soap and head for a doctor. "Now, rabies vaccines are available at all medical facilities," he said.

Livestock Development Department veterinarian Pranee Panichpong said it remained unclear what caused the rabies infection in the rabbit. There is a possibility the disease might have been spread from rabbits it was raised with or from a rat in the house. "In collaboration with the BMA, we will check whether other rats in the area are infected with rabies," she said.

Her advice to the public is that they should vaccinate their pets against rabies.
