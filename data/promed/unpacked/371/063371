[While this newswire comes from a Pakistani news source in Chaman Pakistan,
Spin Boldak is just across the border in Afghanistan. It is unclear if the
villages mentioned are all in Afghanistan or if some are in Pakistan as
well. While the newswire does not give clinical details on the
manifestations of the disease, there is the conclusion that this disease
outbreak is waterborne. It is unusual that the age group of the affected
mentioned here is the 30 to 40 year old age group. Clearly more
information on this outbreak would be appreciated to permit an adequate
assessment of what is going on. - Mod.MPP]
