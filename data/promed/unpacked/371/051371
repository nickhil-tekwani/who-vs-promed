RFI ON PARASITE NEW TO SALMON
I read in the 21 Feb. issue of Animal Pharm that Canadian researchers had
found a parasite new to the Atlantic salmon in Britsh Columbia in 1996.
The parasite is called Haemobaphes disphaerocephalus and this infection is
thought to be linked to the farming of Atlantic salmon in his alien ocean,
the Pacific.
Has anyone some more information about this parasite ? Protozoon ? Worm ? Any
picture available ? Normal host ?
