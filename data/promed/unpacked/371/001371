Powdery mildew alert
---------------------
Farmers in the Lower Great Southern intending to grow barley this
[2010] season have been urged to take action to protect their crop
after indications of the fungal disease powdery mildew. Barley
powdery mildew spores have been detected in a spore trap at the
Department of Agriculture and Food's Albany office.

Plant pathologist Kith Jayasena said as a result there was a risk of
early season powdery mildew infection in the region, which if left
unattended could cause yield losses of more than 20 percent. "The
initial detection has been confirmed by the appearance of visual
symptoms on susceptible indicator plants," he said. "Growers are
urged to treat susceptible barley varieties with either seed dressing
or in-furrow fungicides."

Dr Jayasena said the powdery mildew pathogen can survive in barley
regrowth and on barley stubble from the previous season. "Unprotected
new barley crops can be infected by airborne spores released from
infected barley stubbles or from infected barley regrowth," he said.

[Powdery mildew caused by the fungus _Blumeria graminis_ f. sp.
_hordei_ is one of the major diseases of barley. It affects leaves,
stems, and ears of both winter and spring varieties. Symptoms are
most common on leaves and include a white fluffy growth, chlorosis,
and loss of photosynthetic ability reducing plant vigour and seed
production. Masses of spores are produced leading to a 'powdery'
appearance. High levels of disease at an early growth stage can kill
out tillers. Many varieties show adult resistance and therefore
disease levels are generally lower later in the season.

The fungus overwinters primarily as mycelium on volunteer barley
plants and autumn-sown crops. Spores are spread by wind, water, and
mechanical means. Management strategies include cultural practices to
reduce inoculum (burying stubble, crop rotation, control of volunteer
barley), fungicides, use of clean seed, and use of resistant barley
varieties.

There are several other forms of the pathogen. The strains are
specific to individual crops and do not cross infect: f. sp _tritici_
affects wheat, f. sp _avenae_ affects oats, and f. sp _secalis_
affects rye.

Spore traps are used for determining identity and time of dispersal
of fungi. Spores can be identified by morphology to genus and
sometimes species. They can indicate the presence of a fungal
pathogen before disease is discovered in the field because symptoms
need time to develop and may initially be difficult to detect.
