I got a couple of emails from people who couldn't get information from the
Argentine website regarding the outbreak. The reason is that they have
updated the design; but the information is still there. Today (13 Sep 2003)
the way to get it was:
1. go to the web page (<http://www.senasa.gov.ar>).
2. There is a report titled CONFIRMAN FIEBRE AFTOSA EN TARTAGAL, PROVINCIA
DE SALTA
3. under that report there is a link titled "Ver informes de acciones
sanitarias..."
Click there and you will be directed to the reports. There you will find a
list of the reports in Spanish, English, and Russian.
