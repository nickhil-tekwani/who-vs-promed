Snails cause meningitis in Beijing
-----------------------------------
Eating raw or half-raw snails has led to almost 40 people in Beijing
coming down with meningitis, state media said on Monday [21 Aug
2006], and the same species is being blamed for destroying a huge
swath of rice crops. Around half of the victims had eaten a dish made
with the Amazonian snails at a chain of Sichuan restaurants, the
China Daily said. "The large, black snails are a hot-selling aquatic
product in big Chinese cities like Beijing," Xinhua news agency said,
adding that those falling sick had been infected by parasitic eel worms.
But the problem does not end there. "Amazonian snails ... are now
being blamed for killing crops on more than 160,000 hectares" (617 sq
miles) in the southwestern autonomous region of Guangxi Zhuang, Xinhua said.
"Farmers near 7 cities in Guangxi have reported an invasion of
Amazonian snails in their paddy fields. Agricultural experts said
rainy weather, brought by this summer's typhoons, created ideal
conditions for the snails."

Eating snails leads to meningitis in Beijing
----------------
At least 50 people have been diagnosed as suffering from a
parasite-caused meningitis after eating raw or half-raw snails at
Beijing restaurants.
It is the first time the so-called Guangzhou angiostrongylus
meningitis has been found in Beijing, according to the Beijing
Municipal Health Bureau's website.
It has warned people not to eat raw seafood, which may carry
parasites that threaten health.
The 1st case, involving a 34-year-old man, was found by the Beijing
Friendship Hospital in June [2006].
The patient suffered from unbearable headaches and nausea after
eating a dish called cold snail meat in [a local] restaurant.
The snail meat was from Amazonian snails Fushouluo in Chinese a
popular dish in Sichuan-style restaurants in Beijing
Doctors took samples from the restaurant and found the parasite in 2
of the snails.
By last Thursday [17 Aug 2006], 23 people had been found to suffer
from the meningitis in the capital's hospitals, said the bureau.
They had all eaten cold or spicy snail meat, from Amazonian snails,
at branches of the same restaurant.
According to the bureau, 5 of the 23 were in a serious condition, 3
had left hospital, and 2 were seemingly self-cured. No deaths have
been reported.
As it can take as long as a month after eating for symptoms to
appear, some diners may not link their headache with the snails, and
doctors may not be able to find the real reason for the illness.
After local media reported the news, the Beijing Friendship Hospital
received more than 90 people over the weekend, all worried they might
get the disease since they had eaten snail dishes in the past 2 months.
The hospital claimed 17 of them were suffering from meningitis. The
youngest patient was 13 years old, the Beijing Evening News reported yesterday.
Currently the [involved] restaurant is not selling the dish while
diners elsewhere are refusing to eat Amazonian snails.
According to the bureau, other seafood may also contain parasites but
the Amazonian snail can host more than others.

[It is not clear what "parasitic eel worms" refers to.
_Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ is known to cause eosinophilic
meningitis. The posting contains no details at all on how the
diagnosis was supported and why a parasitic cause of the meningitis
was suspected. Food borne infections are important, and ProMED will
be happy to publish any further details. - Mod.EP]
[A literature search on _Angiostrongylus cantonensis_ in China
revealed it was 1st identified in 1984. Most of the references
available are in the Chinese literature. Ref 1 gives a nice overview
of the problem with the conclusion that there is much more to be
learned about the epidemiology of the problem, but it does appear to
be an emerging disease on the Chinese mainland and is probably
grossly underreported/identified as a problem. In an outbreak in
Wenzhou (ref 3), the vehicle of transmission was ingestion of
undercooked _Ampullaria gigas_ ("apple snails") in a restaurant in
the city. In the above outbreak, the type of snail mentioned is
"Amazonian snails" and the Chinese name for the snail dish is given
"Fushouluo". More information on this outbreak would be very much appreciated.
