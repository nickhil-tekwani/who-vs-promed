Mystery disease claims 28 cattle
-----------------------------------
At least 28 cattle (official figure 19) have fallen prey to a mystery
disease in the Swara village of Kharar. Dairy farmers, the majority of whom
[can ill afford] to bear the loss, have been shocked by the impact of the
fatal syndrome, which has spread since January [2005].
Punjab Assembly former Deputy Speaker Bir Devinder Singh has ordered
re-vaccination of all animals in the village and deputed a team of senior
veterinarians, headed by Jalandhar zonal Animal Husbandry joint director
H.S. Sangha, to carry out clinical investigations for unveiling mystery
behind the killer disease. Singh has also assured compensation for losses
and a high-level probe to determine the responsibility of "negligent"
veterinarians. In addition, a 24-hour control room has also been set up to
monitor the follow-up action until the situation returns to normal.
Beginning 2 Jan 2005, the cattle started falling prey to the mystery
disease, with 5 cattle belonging to Gurmeet Singh dying mysteriously within
2 weeks. The villagers claimed that the trend continued to the present
date, claiming the lives of 28 cattle. However, only 19 deaths have been
confirmed by the Animal Husbandry Department, which has termed the deaths
sporadic while ruling out any epidemic.
The cause of death remains unknown, with postmortem examinations of 3
carcasses still pending.

[The denominator of the 19 or 28 dead bovines -- namely population size --
should be considered in evaluating the significance of this event. The
mention of re-vaccination may indicate a suspicion of infectious disease
against which vaccination is practiced in bovines in Punjab (FMD?).
Nonetheless, since the mortalities are spread over a period longer than 2
months, this does not seem a very alarming situation.
Information on clinical symptoms, age distribution of the affected animals,
vaccine applied, PM findings, and laboratory findings will be helpful. -
