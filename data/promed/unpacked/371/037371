Dropsy alert in Uttar Pradesh
-----------------------------
The Uttar Pradesh government has sounded an alert against what could be a
major outbreak of the deadly dropsy disease in the state. While officials
have confirmed 2 deaths due to dropsy, a disease caused by adulterated
mustard oil, the detection of over 100 cases in just one month has caused
alarm.
The administration's delay in taking action against oil traders, alleged to
be openly adulterating mustard with the toxic _Argemone mexicana_ seed, led
to a rise in dropsy cases, officials said. "We collected oil samples from
traders and tested them at a public laboratory, and 15 were found to be
adulterated," Lucknow district magistrate Aradhana Shukla said.
However, guilty traders removed their oil stocks overnight. "As of today
[19 Feb 2005], most of the big oil dealers are showing zero stocks of
mustard oil," said Radhey Shyam Gupta of the Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar
Mandal, the traders' council. He blamed the thriving "oil mafia" for
stealthily removing 25 000 15 kg mustard oil tins from the state capital
over the past 24 hours, since the district administration decided to crack
the whip.
It was only after the matter was raised in the state assembly on Friday
that health minister Jaiveer Singh on Saturday visited 32 dropsy patients
at 2 government hospitals in Lucknow. "All patients are receiving
appropriate treatment and are recovering fast," he said.
But residents of the worst affected slums in Rajajipuram alleged that some
of the patients with dropsy symptoms were not being admitted by hospitals.
"My daughter suddenly developed severe swelling in her lower limbs, but the
Balrampur hospital authorities initially said it was an insect bite. Only
later, when her condition worsened, and I approached a local politician,
did they admit her for dropsy," said the victim's father, a rickshaw puller
in Rajajipuram.
