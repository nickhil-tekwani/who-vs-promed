["_Mycobacterium avium_ subspecies _paratuberculosis_ (MAP) is an organism first observed by Johne & Frothingham in 1895. MAP causes paratuberculosis or Johne's disease, an intestinal granulomatous infection. Paratuberculosis is found most often among domestic ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, camelids, and buffaloes) as well as wild ruminants (cervids) and has a global distribution. The disease has also been reported in horses, pigs, rabbits, stoat, fox, and weasel. Under natural conditions, the disease in cattle spreads by ingestion of MAP from the contaminated environment. The disease persists after the introduction of infected animals. Infection can be spread vertically to the fetus and semen can be infected with the organism. The primary source of infection in calves is milk from infected cows or milk that is contaminated with the faeces of diseased cattle." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.15_PARATB.pdf)

"In cattle, the main symptoms of paratuberculosis are diarrhea and wasting. Most cases are seen in 2 to 6 year old animals. The initial symptoms can be subtle and may be limited to weight loss, decreased milk production or roughening of the hair coat. The diarrhea is usually thick, without blood, mucus, or epithelial debris, and may be intermittent at first. Tenesmus is not seen. As the disease progresses, the diarrhea becomes more constant and severe over weeks or months, and intermandibular or ventral edema may occur. The temperature and appetite are usually normal and animals are alert. Paratuberculosis is progressive; affected animals become increasingly emaciated and usually die as the result of dehydration and severe cachexia. The clinical signs are similar in other ruminants. In sheep and goats, the wool is often damaged and easily shed, and diarrhea is less common than in cattle. In captive deer, paratuberculosis can be rapidly progressive." (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/paratuberculosis.pdf)

"Paratuberculosis vaccines can cause severe local reactions including sloughing of tissues, chronic synovitis and tendonitis, if they are accidentally injected into humans. Some cases may require surgery. Limited data suggest that _M. avium_ subsp _paratuberculosis_ may be involved in Crohn's disease, a chronic enteritis of humans. Crohn's disease is characterized by periods of malaise, abdominal pain, chronic weight loss, and diarrhea, with remissions and relapses. The disease often begins between the ages of 16 and 25 years, and persists lifelong. There is no cure. The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown; however, it may be the result of several interacting factors including a genetic predisposition, an abnormal immune response, and environmental factors including responses to intestinal microorganisms. _M. avium_ subsp _paratuberculosis_ can be found in some patients; however, isolation is rare and studies to date have not been able to determine whether this organism has a causative role or is simply an "innocent bystander" that can grow in the inflamed intestinal wall." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/paratuberculosis.pdf
