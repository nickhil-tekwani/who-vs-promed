European consumers now have more cause for concern over what they put in
their mouths, as hundreds of cows in the Netherlands are reportedly infected
by a deadly disease that has symptoms similar to AIDS.
According to a report issued by the Netherlands Ministry of Agriculture, the
bovine immune deficiency [virus (BIV) disease first broke out in February
[1999, when authorities ordered the slaughter of 1500 cows at 12 Dutch
farms.
Six thousand Dutch cattle breeders have reported to state veterinarians
their animals have fallen ill with the disease which may have been caused by
expired inoculations performed in 1998.
The sickness represents no threat to dairy products, a spokesman for the
Netherlands Agriculture Ministry stressed.
The confederation of Dutch cattle-breeders believes the disease is not a new
development and maintains that it has to do with the inoculation against
other bovine illnesses. Meanwhile, the confederation has blocked large
quantities of beef destined for exportation to Greece.

Dutch authorities are investigating the outbreak of bovine immune deficiency
virus disease that has killed dairy cows at 12 Dutch farms, the Agriculture
Ministry said on Tuesday.
The disease, which surfaced about 3 weeks ago, manifests symptoms similar to
AIDS, stopping the production of white blood cells and antibodies, causing
cows to die from a combination of diseases to which they are normally
immune, a spokesman said.
The disease represents no threat to dairy products produced in the
Netherlands, he added. He added the symptoms have been seen in fewer than
100 cows.
However, Dutch farmers' association LTO Nederland said there was no evidence
of a new disease and said the symptoms and subsequent deaths of the cows on
the 12 farms was most likely related to vaccinations given for other cow
diseases.

[Bovine Immunodeficiency Syndrome or Bovine Immunodeficiency-like virus is
also known as BIV for Bovine Immunodeficiency Virus. This is a lentivius and
is as far removed from HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) as are the other
lentiviruses of animals. BIV has at least two primary pathologic effects on
the host system, a non-excitatory viral-type encephalitis and a depletion of
the lymphoid organs. (Comparative Immunology, Microbiology & Infectious
Disease, 19 (2): 117-131, 1996).
BIV disease usually follows a long course of years and may involve various
secondary disease processes. Cows and calves with BIV infection may be first
recognized by an increase in subcutaneos lymph nodes that are easily
palpated. With the onset of stresses or disease co-factors, such as calving
and lactation, shipment, minor injuries, etc, affected animals become dull
in behaviour, develop subcutaneous abscesses, become lame in one or more
feet due to laminitis, develop mastitis [inflammation of the udder, and may
succumb to conventional disease processes despite appropriate therapy.
Pasteurization of milk destroys the infectivity of BIV, therefore, there is
no public health risk associated with dairy products. Individuals with
potential exposure to this virus have not demonstrated any serological or
disease reactivity. Natural transmission has not been documented, but
probably occurs as with other lentiviruses which is through semen,
unpasteurized milk and blood.
BIV has been reported to cause three clinical syndromes including
lympoproliferation, encephalitis and immunodeficiency.
Jembrana disease virus is similar and causes an acute and sometimes fatal
infection in Bali cattle (_Bos javonicus-). The search for more information
on the Jembrana disease virus continues.

This is a difficult syndrome to track down. Some pathologists believe that
there are neurological problems and that this may be a real syndrome, but
all the evidence may not be in - Mod.TG
