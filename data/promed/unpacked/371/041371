The Phylogeny of Novel Paramyxovirus Pathogens
----------------------------------------------
Livestock Industries scientists Dr Linfa Wang and Dr Bryan Eaton have this
week published a review paper in Infectious Disease Review, describing
Hendra virus and [the other novel members of the family _Paramyxoviridae_
that have cropped up around the world since 1962. In total 15 new
paramyxoviruses have been discovered in the past 40 years in animal hosts
ranging from dolphins, seals, snakes, rats, bats, to horses and humans. Dr
Wang says that the Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL)of the
Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO)is now the
only institute in the world holding a collection of all major newly
discovered paramyxoviruses. He predicts the collection will grow over the
next decade. "It is almost inevitable that new viruses will be discovered.
This is a family of viruses where it is clear there are many more members
out there that we don't know about yet," he said.
"These new viruses are important, because some are causing threats to public
health, livestock production and trade, and many may also pose a risk to
wild animals where populations have already been reduced by environmental
destruction or other factors. AAHL's collection of paramyxoviruses and
further comparative research puts us in a strong position to help diagnose
and respond to the next emerging paramyxovirus," Dr Wang says. "The genomic
characterization of these new viruses has significantly expanded our
knowledge about paramyxovirus evolution. A new virus genus has been
established based on our recent studies, and several other viruses are yet
to be classified."
Retrospective analysis by the team has identified some intriguing patterns.
CSIRO scientists have now completed deciphering the genetic code of 2
viruses, one [Mapuera virus found in a Brazilian bat in 1979, and another
[porcine rubulavirus, formerly known as La Piedad-Michoacan-mexico virus
that caused a brain disease in Mexican pigs in 1984. As the genetic analysis
shows the 2 viruses are closely related, scientists believe the Mexican
virus may have jumped to pigs from bats, as is believed to have happened
with other newly emergent paramyxoviruses, Menangle virus in Australia in
1997, and Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999.
Of the 15 viruses that are under investigation 4 have recently emerged in
Australia, or were isolated in this country many years ago and have remained
uncharacterised. Mossman virus was first detected in Queensland in 1970, in
a rat. J virus was discovered 3 years later, also in Queensland, in wild
mice. Dr Bryan Eaton says the 2 paramyxoviruses are now being characterized
to better understand where they sit in the [paramyxovirus family tree.
"Already it is clear that they are novel members of the growing
paramyxovirus family. We also want to understand the disease-causing
potential of the viruses," he says.
The other 2 paramyxoviruses that have emerged in Australia are Hendra virus,
which killed 2 people and several horses in 1994, 1995 and 1999 in
Queensland, and Menangle virus, which caused stillborn piglets in a New
South Wales piggery. Two piggery workers suffered an influenza-like illness
and were believed to have been infected with Menangle virus in 1997. Both
Hendra virus and Menangle virus are believed to be carried by flying foxes
(fruit bats). A group of Queensland-based researchers proved the link
between bats and Hendra virus when they isolated the virus from these
animals, confirming other evidence such as some bats being found with
specific antibodies to the virus. The relevant State authorities
successfully contained outbreaks of the Hendra and Menangle viruses. The
Nipah virus outbreak in Malaysia was also successfully brought under control.
The Executive Committee of the International Committee for the Taxonomy of
Viruses has agreed to name the genus within the family _Paramyxoviridae_,
that contains the Hendra and Nipah viruses, the genus _Henipavirus_. The
genus _Henipavirus_ becomes the fourth genus within the subfamily
_Paramyxovirinae_ of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. The other genera within
the subfamily are _Rubulavirus_, _Morbillivirus_ and _Respirovirus_.

[The number of new paramyxoviruses discovered in recent years is noteworthy
and several have been associated with disease in humans, domestic livestock
and wild animals. The most recent to be discovered is the Human
metapneumovirus (subfamily _Pneumovirinae_) discovered in the Netherlands
this year, which may rank equal in importance with human respiratory
syncytial virus as a respiratory pathogen in infancy. - Mod.CP
