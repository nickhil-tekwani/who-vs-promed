Poison cake kills Iraqi children
----------------------------------
The UK government has flown antidote medicine to the Middle East
after some Iraqis became seriously ill from eating cakes laced with
the poison thallium. 2 of the victims, both children, died after
eating cake delivered to a military club in Baghdad. Others are being
treated in hospital in the Jordanian capital, Amman.

It is the 1st time the deadly toxin has been used since the downfall
of Saddam Hussein, whose regime used it to kill its opponents.

At least 2 of the poison victims, the secretary of the Iraqi air
force club and his daughter, are critically ill in Amman. They and
half-a-dozen other patients suffering from thallium poisoning were
flown from Baghdad to Amman as the necessary treatments and antidotes
were not available in Iraq.

Britain responded to a request for help from the World Health
Organization and medication was flown out.

Lethal poison
--------------
Thallium is a lethal poison much used by Saddam Hussein's regime
against its opponents. It has not surfaced since his overthrow. It is
an ideal assassin's tool, being tasteless and easy to administer, and
its effects take some time to appear. It then causes a lingering and
painful death. An antidote known as Prussian Blue can be effective if
taken quickly.

An investigation is under way in Baghdad, but the affair remains
shrouded in mystery. The manager of the air force club told the BBC
he believed it was carried out by conspirators with a grudge against
the club's administration.

In what appeared to be a goodwill gesture, a former official
delivered 2 cakes laced with thallium. They were taken home by 2
officials and eaten by their families, who all fell ill.

[This article does not give us an indication of time frames. How long
between ingestion and symptoms? If this was a short time frame, it
would certainly imply a large dose to create an acute disease
response. Without a time frame it is difficult to know what the early
clinical signs and symptoms were that lead the physicians to suspect
thallium or if this was diagnosed because of testing on the food stuffs.

Thallium is classified as a heavy metal but it is colorless, odorless
and tasteless.

Thallium was discovered in 1861 by Sir William Cookes who named the
new element "thallium" from the Greek "thallos", meaning "green twig"
in honor of the bright green spectral emission lines that identified
the element.

The element was at some time in the past used as a therapeutic
treatment for syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and ringworm. It was
even tried as a depilatory for excess hair. There were, however,
reports of poisoning and some deaths were also reported.
Consequently, its use was discontinued for the purposes noted above.

However, it did seem to have other uses where death was the desired
endpoint. It was employed successfully for killing rats, prairie
dogs, and other unwanted pests. Unintentional poisoning,
unfortunately, are still reported in other countries where thallium
is used as a rodenticide and ant killer.

Thallium has other uses such as in the manufacture of electronic
components, semiconductor materials, gamma radiation detection
equipment, optical lenses, green fireworks, imitation jewelry, low
temperature thermometers, and artist's paints, to name a few. In
trace amounts it has some medical uses, such as a contrast agent in
the visualization of cardiac function and tumors. Industrial uses may
lead to thallium exposure at smelters when there is maintenance and
cleaning of ducts and flues. Thallium may also be a contaminate of
cocaine, heroin, and herbal products. Criminal and unintentional
thallium poisonings are still reported, some resulting in deaths.

Thallium poisoning may occur via oral ingestion, inhalation of
contaminated dust, or dermal absorption. Thallium is rapidly
distributed to the blood and to well-perfused organs such as the
kidney, liver, and muscle. The lethal dose of thallium is
approximately 15-20 mg/kg; however, significant toxicity and death
may occur with smaller amounts. Thallium poisoning more commonly
occurs after oral ingestion. Thallium is rapidly distributed
intracellularly throughout all body tissues, with a large volume of
distribution estimated to be about 3.6 L/kg

The exact mechanism of pathophysiology is unknown, but there are some
known steps. Because of thallium's similarity in charge and ionic
radius to potassium, thallium is able to enter cells, inhibit
Na-K-ATPase, and interfere with energy production at essential steps
in glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. In
addition, thallium may interfere with formation of disulfide bonds
due to a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups. Furthermore, its
similarity to potassium allows it to accumulate in areas rich in
potassium, including muscular, hepatic, and nervous tissue. Its
accumulation in muscular tissue is the basis for the use of
radioactive thallium in cardiac imaging studies.

A further possible toxic mechanism of thallium is interference in
riboflavin homeostasis. Thallium forms insoluble complexes with
riboflavin resulting in its intracellular sequestration. Indeed,
deficiency of this vitamin results in dermatitis, alopecia, and
neuropathy, which are the hallmarks of thallium poisoning.

Thallium can be lethal to humans. The lethal dose for humans is 15-20
mg/kg (around 1 g for a 70-kg person). Nonfatal effects occur below
this dose. However, it is conceivable that even smaller doses can
still cause fatality (minimal reported dose was 8 mg/kg). In
addition, some of the treated patients survived exposure up to 28 mg/kg.

Acute thallium poisoning is primarily characterized by
gastrointestinal symptoms, while neurologic findings predominate with
chronic exposure. The neurologic manifestations tend to progress,
even despite decreasing blood thallium levels. Thallium toxicity is
characterized by a painful ascending peripheral neuropathy and
alopecia; this clinical manifestation presents 2-3 weeks after an
acute poisoning.

The definitive clinical diagnosis of thallium poisoning can only be
established by demonstrating elevated thallium levels. Thallium can
be recovered in the hair, nails, feces, saliva, blood, and urine.

A 24-hour urine thallium concentration is the standard toxicologic
method and is assayed by atomic absorption photospectrometry. The
normal level is less than 5 mcg/L. A urine spot test can deliver
faster results. However, it often gives false-positive results, and
it requires the use of 20 percent nitric acid, which can be dangerous
and is usually not readily available.

Because it is rapidly eliminated from the body, measurements of blood
thallium reflect only recent exposures. Thus, it is not generally
considered to be a reliable means of identifying or monitoring
exposure to thallium.

A CBC with differential can identify anemia, leukocytosis,
eosinophilia, and thrombocytopenia, which have all been reported in
cases of thallium exposure. Anemia most likely occurs secondary to GI
hemorrhage.

Electrolytes, calcium, glucose, BUN, creatinine, and LFTs should be
obtained. Thallium exposure can lead to electrolyte and glucose
abnormalities, hypocalcemia, and impair renal and hepatic dysfunction.

Prussian blue is a crystal blue lattice of potassium ferric
ferrocyanide and acts by forming a nonabsorbable complex with
thallium. This use as a chelator interrupts its enterohepatic
recirculation and increases its excretion.

In patients in whom Prussian blue cannot be obtained and thallium
poisoning is suspected, multidose activated charcoal may be
effective. Because thallium undergoes enterohepatic and enteroenteric
recirculation, repeated charcoal administration (0.25-0.5 g/kg q2-4h)
may enhance fecal elimination.

Forced diuresis with potassium loading was previously recommended to
increase the renal clearance of thallium, but this may exacerbate the
neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms and is no longer advised.

Chelating agents such as EDTA, dimercaprol, and D-penicillamine have
not been shown to be effective and should be avoided.

The usefulness of hemodialysis and hemoperfusion is controversial,
but they may be useful during early thallium poisoning before
extensive distribution within the body tissues has occurred.
