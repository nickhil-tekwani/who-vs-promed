Two new strains of downy mildew of spinach (_Peronospora farinosa_) have been named by the International Working Group on Peronospora in Spinach (IWGP). Isolate SP1924 which was found in Europe will be called race Pe 18. Isolate UA202001E, found in the USA, will be called race Pe 19. Several spinach varieties resistant to both are already available.

Both of the new races pose a considerable threat for spinach industries worldwide. The resistant varieties are an important resource. An integrated approach which includes resistant varieties, chemical control measures and plant hygiene practices is recommended to prevent new mildew strains with increased pathogenicity to evolve. Hygiene practices such as removal of crop debris and infected plants will also reduce the spread of the pathogen within crops.

IWGP monitors constantly the emergence of new strains of the pathogen that differ in virulence from known strains. The aim is communication between all interested parties about all host resistance breaking mildew strains that succeed to persist over several years, occur over wide areas and cause considerable economic effects.

[Downy mildew caused by _Peronospora farinosa_ (Pf; previously f.sp. _spinaciae_, _P. effusa_; also called blue mould) is often considered the most widespread and destructive disease of spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_, family Amaranthaceae) worldwide. The fungus is specific to spinach and a few weeds of the genus _Chenopodium_. Symptoms include spots on the upper leaf surfaces which can become necrotic and lead to leaf distortion, as well as "downy" growth on the leaf undersides. Infected plants are unmarketable; their taste is altered even when used as tinned food. Disease development is favoured by cool, humid conditions and mostly occurs in young plants.

The fungus survives between crops as spores in soil or mycelium on seeds. Spread within a crop may occur by mechanical means, wind, and splashing water. Disease management may include preventative fungicide applications, crop rotation, and cultural practices to minimise inoculum and reduce free moisture in the crop. Previously, cultivars with single-gene resistance to a given pathogen race were used. Since these cultivars are increasingly succumbing to new races emerging in Europe, the Americas, and Japan, breeding programmes for resistant crop cultivars have been set up in a number of countries.

Pf strains (races) are initially identified by their pathogenicity on suitably modified sets of differential spinach host cultivars (see links below), followed by molecular characterisation. There are currently no crop cultivars available that are simultaneously resistant to all known Pf races.
