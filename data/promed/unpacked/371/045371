Since our last report on the Japanese syphilis situation in mid-July 2021 [http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-syphilis-cases-top-3000/], the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo reported more than 1300 additional cases, including 100 cases in just the week ending 25 Aug [2021]. This brings the cumulative total to 4349 syphilis cases through the end of August [2021].

To date in 2021, the prefectures reporting the most cases include Tokyo (1433), Osaka (446), Aichi (218), Fukuoka (197), and Kanagawa (172).

Japan reported more than 5000 syphilis cases 3 years straight [http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-reports-more-than-5000-syphilis-cases-for-3rd-year-in-a-row-28736/] and 2 consecutive years with more than 6000 cases [http://outbreaknewstoday.com/syphilis-in-japan-2nd-year-reporting-more-than-6000-cases-28289/]. Prior to 2018, the last time Japan saw more than 6000 syphilis cases was 48 years ago.

Syphilis was rampant in Japan until shortly after the end of World War II, but the total reported cases declined to several hundred annually until 2011, when a rebound began.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can cause long-term complications if not treated correctly. Symptoms of syphilis in adults include a painless sore that will go away without treatment followed by a non-itchy body rash. If left untreated, syphilis can lead to damage through the body, including neurological and cardiovascular complications. Syphilis also increases the risk of HIV infection and, for women, can cause problems during pregnancy and for the newborn.

[Although not stated above, the number of cases of syphilis each year reported above are total cases, which include cases of primary and secondary syphilis, the most contagious forms of syphilis, latent ("asymptomatic") syphilis, tertiary ("late symptomatic") syphilis, and congenital syphilis (as shown in a table from Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) at https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif), with 4575 total cases in 2016, 5826 in 2017, and 7007 in 2018. In 2019 there were 6577 total cases (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/japan-reports-more-than-6500-syphilis-cases-in-2019/), and in 2020, 6923 cases. From the NIID table, in recent years, about 70% of the total cases each year in Japan are cases of primary and secondary syphilis.

The incidence of primary and secondary syphilis that initially involved mainly men who have sex with men has more recently involved women in their 20s and 30s. (See ProMED posts: Syphilis - Japan (02): rising incidence, heterosexual women & men, urban 20181202.6175741, and Syphilis - Japan: more cases, heterosexual women, congenital 20191127.6800502).

The increase in the incidence of syphilis in women of childbearing age has been associated with a rising incidence of congenital syphilis in Japan, according to data compiled by Japan's NIID (https://www.niid.go.jp/niid/images/iasr/2020/1/479tt01.gif), with 10 cases in 2014, 13 in 2015, 15 in 2016, 9 in 2017, 17 in 2018, and 17 cases reported by the 42nd week of 2019 (week ending 19 Oct 2019) (https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20191125/p2a/00m/0na/015000c).
