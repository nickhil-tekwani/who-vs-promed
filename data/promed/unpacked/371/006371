[ref: Y Martinez, et al. First report of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter
asiaticus associated with huanglongbing in Cuba. BSPP New Disease Reports,
vol 18]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus greening, also known as huanglongbing (HLB), is a destructive citrus
disease caused by an uncultured phloem-restricted bacterium of alpha
subdivision of proteobacteria for which 3 species, _Candidatus_
Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), _Ca._ L. africanus (Laf), and _Ca._ L.
americanus (Lam), have been characterized. Characteristic symptoms of HLB
appear both on fruit and on leaves as chlorosis and mottling, the latter
resembling zinc deficiency symptoms. In some cases a green colour develops
on fruit at the peduncular end. Recently characteristic HLB patterns of
mottling and asymmetric chlorosis have been observed in citrus production
areas throughout Cuba.

A total of 10 leaf samples were collected from 5 symptomatic and 5
symptomless trees. DNA was used in a simple PCR [polymerase chain reaction]
reaction for both _Ca._ L. africanus and _Ca._ L. asiaticus, allowing the
differentiation of these 2 strains. Amplicons of 703 basepairs
corresponding to _Ca._ L. asiaticus were obtained from 3 symptomatic
plants, and not from the symptomless plants. Two amplicons were sequenced.
The ribosomal protein sequences shared 100 per cent identity with each
other, and 99 per cent with those of the ribosomal protein and RNA
polymerase of _Ca._ Liberibacter asiaticus identified in Brazil and Asia,
including Japan, China, and India. The cloned amplicons from _Ca._ L.
asiaticus identified in Cuba were further used as probes to detect _Ca._ L.
asiaticus in 49/109 symptomatic plants randomly collected from HLB-affected
citrus fields by a dot-blot hybridization assay.

These results are the 1st record of HLB and the molecular identification of
the associated bacterium, _Ca._ L. asiaticus, in Cuba.

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, is one of the most damaging
diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In the Americas it is
caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_
Liberibacter asiaticus, which also occurs throughout much of Asia. However,
the species may comprise several different variants, even within a given
region. Its vector is the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it
is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission. The vector
is specific to _Citrus_ and close relatives and thus the disease is
confined to these crops. The other 2 species of _Ca._ L. (africanus and
americanus) may cause HLB in different areas. For more information on HLB
see links and previous posts listed below.

Dot-blot hybridisation assay is a molecular diagnostic method where plant
sap samples are 'dotted' onto a supportive membrane and labelled nucleotide
sequences of the pathogen are used as 'probes' to detect the presence of
similar sequences in the samples.
