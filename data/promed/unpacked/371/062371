The moderator stated: "[The article mentions the horse was euthanized but
does not tell us what happened to the sentinel chicken. In all likelihood
the chicken died of the disease as birds tend to be sensitive to the
encephalitis diseases. This includes such birds as emus and ostriches as
well."]

The chicken did not die from EEE. We have used sentinel chickens as an
effective early warning of arbovirus transmission in Florida for many
years. Chickens were chosen for this task because they do not become sick
or die upon infection and they do not build a viremia sufficient to infect
mosquitoes. They do, however, build antibody to the infecting viruses and
that antibody is our detection target. Sera are collected weekly and
submitted to the Florida Department of Health Bureau of Laboratories for
screening by HAI [hemagglutination-inhibition] for antibody to flaviviruses
and to alphaviruses. Reactive/positive sera are confirmed by IgM Elisa
and/or SN-PRNT [serum neutralization test-plaque reduction neutralization
test] to determine specific etiology. We have even had individual chickens
seroconvert in the same serum sample to both WN and to EEE, with no
apparent ill effect on the bird. In the 22 year period between 1988 and
2009, 49 231 birds (547 313 sera) have been tested in this program,
allowing Florida to effectively target active transmission areas with
activities for prevention of widespread epidemics.
