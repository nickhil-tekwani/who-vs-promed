Experts: Bird Flu Hits Dutch Poultry, No Human Risk
--------------------------------------------------
A highly contagious and fast-spreading bird influenza virus has
brought the poultry industry in the Netherlands, the largest exporter
of poultry in Europe, to a standstill, but the government has said
the virus poses no danger to humans.

To prevent the spread of the disease, authorities Monday began
isolating and destroying poultry in one of 17 farms suspected of
harboring the virus in the Eastern province of Gelderland, near the
German border.

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture said that authorities
were set to work throughout Monday night to destroy the poultry at 4
more farms.

Called the Klassieke Vogelpest in Holland, the bird flu is a highly
contagious viral infection that spreads very quickly through the air
and via infected manure carried on shoes or tires from farm to farm.
The virus is an H7 subtype of avian influenza, according to the
Ministry of Agriculture.

Both the Ministries of Health and Agriculture have said there is no
indication that the virus could spread to humans. A ministry Web site
press release said it is 100 percent safe to eat eggs.

"The avian influenza is 100 percent not dangerous to humans," Monique
Matze, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Agriculture, said in an
interview with Reuters Health. When asked if the elderly and persons
with compromised or weakened immune systems might be at greater risk,
she responded, "no, there is absolutely no danger."

Matze said that the virus could spread to other birds, including
turkeys, Guinea fowl, and pigeons, presenting further complications
for authorities. Part of the reason that infections spread so fast is
the high density of the animals in Holland.

There has been criticism of the government for responding too slowly
to the disease. Some farmers have been quoted in the media saying
they fear that the disease might now reach the German border.

"We have lots of regulations in place and a whole system of alerts
for disease that might be contagious," said Matze. "But you have to
sort out what sort of virus it is...you must have the correct
diagnosis."

Just a few weeks ago in Hong Kong, 2 members of the same family died
and a third became seriously ill with an avian flu virus. Health
authorities believe they contracted the disease via contact with
infected poultry on a relative's farm. Doctors confirmed that one
patient had contracted the virus H5N1 after visiting relatives who
keep chickens in China's southern Fujian province. His 9-year-old son
was also infected but recovered.

These were the first cases of bird flu passing to humans since an
outbreak in the territory killed 6 people in 1997, triggering
worldwide alarm.

"Given the conditions in the Netherlands I don't think there is any
risk of infection to humans," said Albert Osterhaus, a leading Dutch
virologist, in an interview with Reuters Health on Tue, 4 Mar 2003.

Osterhaus, an advisor to Health Ministry, said that the Netherlands
is experiencing an outbreak of the H7N7 strain of the bird virus. The
concern is that if a human does become infected with the bird virus
and a human flu virus at the same time, the viruses could "exchange
genetic material and create a new virus which could be fatal, which
then could lead to a pandemic," Osterhaus said.

Commission adopts control measures to contain avian influenza
outbreak in the Netherlands
-------------------------------------------------
Brussels: Following a suspected outbreak of avian influenza in the
Netherlands on 28 Feb 2003, the Commission adopted a Decision today
to reinforce the control measures already put in place by the Dutch
authorities. Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease
that can cause severe economic damage to the poultry industry.

Suspicion of an outbreak of avian influenza in the province of
Gelderland arose on the evening of 28 Feb 2003. The Dutch
authorities, in cooperation with the Commission services, immediately
put in place measures foreseen in Directive 92/40/EC. These measures
include a nationwide standstill for the transport of live poultry and
hatching eggs and a prohibition on dispatching any live poultry or
hatching eggs from the whole territory of the Netherlands.

The Commission Decision adopted today reinforces these measures by
defining them at the EU level. The Commission Decision specifies that
no live poultry and hatching eggs may be dispatched from the
Netherlands to other Member States or third countries. They may also
not be transported within the Netherlands. The Decision is addressed
to the Member States, and all Member States must amend the measures
they apply to trade so that they are in compliance with this
decision. In view of the specificity of poultry production, the Dutch
veterinary authority may authorise movements of day-old chicks and
poultry for immediate slaughter within the Netherlands as of 4 Mar
2003.

The measures contained in the Commission Decision are applicable
until 6 Mar 2003. However, the situation will be reviewed at the
meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
scheduled for 5 Mar 2003. This meeting includes representatives of
the Member States and the Commission. The urgent measures adopted by
the Commission could then be updated to take into account the
development of the situation.

The Commission will continue to work closely with the Dutch
authorities to ensure proper co-ordination within the EU.

[All 15 haemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes of
Influenza A viruses have been isolated from birds. 6 (H) subtypes
(H1, H2, H3, H5, H7 and H9) and 3 (N) subtypes (N1, N2 and N7) have
been isolated in the past, also from humans. In 1996, an influenza A
virus (A/England/268/96), subsequently identified by the
International Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza CVL, Weybridge
to be of subtype H7N7, was isolated from a 43-year-old housewife. She
was referred to a hospital in Oxford, UK, with a 1-day history of
right conjuctivitis. The possible source of infection was a piece of
straw which had entered her eye while she was cleaning out her duck
house. (Kurtz et al, Lancet, Vol 348, Sep 1996, 901-902). Influenza A
viruses of H7N7 subtype have been commonly isolated in surveillance
studies of waterfowl in Europe and other parts of the world. They
have also been identified in the past in horses and seals; see review
by D.J. Alexander and I.H. Brown in Rev. sci. tech. OIE, 2000,19 (1),
197 - 225.

The significance of the current highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) outbreak in the EU context may be illustrated by the past
reported incidence of the disease in the 15 member-countries, as
presented in OIE's data base "Handistatus II" (last year of
occurrence in parentheses): Austria (1946); Belgium (-); Denmark
(0000); Finland (0000); France (1948); Germany (0000); Greece (0000);
Ireland (1983); Italy ((04/2000); Luxembourg (1956); Netherlands
(0000); Portugal (0000); Spain (0000); Sweden (0000); UK (01/1992).
HPAI has been recorded in the past only in 4 out of the other 30
European countries, namely Albania (1973); Armenia (1985); Romania
(1942); and Switzerland (1930). - Mod.AS]
