Virus may affect kinnow production in Pakistan
----------------------------------------------
The country may not achieve its target of kinnow production and export
this year [2011] owing to a virus affecting some citrus producing
areas. Ring spots appear on the skin of kinnow due to the virus.

"This virus hits in orchards where an excellent yield is ready for
harvest," said Ahmad Jawad, Harvest Tradings. He said that a proper
analysis [of the economic damage] would come by the end of December
[2011] and if the virus hits on a vast scale it would hurt the export
target as well as domestic consumption. He estimated that product
prices may also shoot up.

[Ringspot disease due to _Indian citrus ringspot virus_ (ICRSV; genus
_Mandarivirus_) has been reported to cause yield losses of over 95
percent in kinnow mandarin (_Citrus nobilis_ x _C. deliciosa_ hybrid)
and can probably also affect other citrus crops. It also reduces fruit
quality in the remaining crop causing additional economic losses.
Symptoms may include ringspot patterns on leaves, leaf yellowing,
fruit mottling, reduction of the crown, stunting of trees, dieback of
branches, general decline, and loss of plant vigour. Leaf symptoms may
only be visible seasonally.

The virus appears to be spread mainly by grafting from infected mother
trees, which has led to a wide distribution in kinnow orchards, for
example, in northern India. The use of certified clean propagation
material is vital in disease management. Indexing methods based on
herbaceous indicator species have been developed to detect ICRSV
infected plants.

The name citrus ringspot virus is occasionally also being used for
_Citrus psorosis virus_ (genus _Ophiovirus_). Several other graft
transmissible citrus disorders of unknown aetiology are also referred
to as ringspot diseases.
