Influenza Update N 199
----------------------
Summary
-------
- Overall influenza activity in North America increased slightly over the past 3 weeks, but remained at low levels throughout the region.
- Countries from the WHO European Region continued to report low levels of influenza activity with only a few countries reporting sporadic influenza detections among samples from sentinel and non-sentinel sources.
- In northern Asia, influenza activity slightly increased in the north of China and Mongolia.
- Influenza transmission in southern Asia was low. In Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China, and in the south of China influenza detections decreased. In South East Asia, influenza activity decreased in Viet Nam, but increased in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic and Thailand. In this area, co-circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus was reported.
- In the Caribbean region of Central America and tropical South America, influenza A detections remained at low levels. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continued to predominate in certain countries, but the RSV activity largely remained within expected seasonal levels.
- The influenza season in the southern hemisphere is largely over.
- Additional and updated information on non-seasonal [avian] influenza viruses can be found at: http://who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/index.htm.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
Overall influenza activity in North America remained at low levels throughout the region. In Canada and the United States of America, influenza activity increased slightly over the past 3 weeks. In Mexico, influenza activity remained low after a period of 2 months (July-August 2013) with higher influenza activity, while reports of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and pneumonia decreased by 8.6 percent and 3.9 percent respectively from the last week in October 2013.

Europe
Low levels of influenza activity in the WHO European Region continued, with only a few countries reporting sporadic influenza detections among samples from sentinel and non-sentinel sources (1.2 percent influenza positivity was reported in the latest report). The number of hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) remained at an interseasonal level. None of the SARI cases tested so far was found positive for influenza virus.

Northern Africa and the Western and Central Asia region
Influenza activity was low in the Northern Africa and western and central Asia regions. In Azerbaijan and Georgia, influenza-like illness (ILI) activity increased since early September 2013. Sporadic influenza detections were reported in Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Israel and Jordan.

Northern Asia
Influenza activity in the northern region of Asia increased since early October 2013. In Mongolia, clinical respiratory illness activity had begun to increase from mid-August 2013, but ILI morbidity was still within the countrywide tolerance limits for this time of the year. Only one sample tested positive for influenza in this time period, therefore the increase in ILI morbidity was probably due to other respiratory viruses. In the north of China, influenza detections increased since early October 2013, with a influenza positivity rate of 0.8 percent reported last week. All 3 currently circulating seasonal influenza viruses were reported.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean and Central America was at low levels. Decreasing numbers of influenza A virus were detected, as influenza transmission had largely come to an end in the last few weeks in these countries. Among positive specimens, influenza B predominated in Cuba and the Dominican Republic, while influenza A predominated in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Jamaica. In Cuba, a decreasing trend was shown over the past 5 weeks. In Guatemala, the proportion of influenza cases decreased compared to data from the past 3 weeks, and in Honduras, the number of cases indicated that the influenza season had come to an end. However, in El Salvador, reported cases of influenza increased over the past week and were due to influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

In tropical South America, respiratory virus activity continued to decrease following a period of high influenza activity in July and August 2013.

In Venezuela, ARI and pneumonia levels were reported within the expected values for the time of year.

In Ecuador, the number of positive influenza samples steadily decreased following 2 observed peaks this year [2013], one ending in May 2013 due to influenza A(H3N2) and one ending in early September 2013 due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

In Peru, influenza activity seemed to have peaked in July 2013, and the season seems over now.

In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, the proportion of SARI-related hospitalizations remained elevated as compared to the data from the same period last year [2012], especially in the eastern part of the country reported from Santa Cruz and associated with co-circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 (which is already decreasing) and parainfluenza virus.

Brazil showed a continuing decline in the number of positive influenza samples since July 2013, illustrating the end of the influenza season.

Central African tropical region
-------------------------------
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana [W. Africa]and Kenya [E. Africa]reported influenza virus detections.

In Cote d'Ivoire, the number of influenza cases reported was similar to those reported over the past few months, but in the previous week, a transition from influenza B activity to influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was seen.

Ghana reported primarily influenza A(H3N2) in the past week, with a small number of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses.

Kenya reported influenza activity that was relatively high over the past 3 weeks comprised of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses.

Tropical Asia
-------------
Influenza transmission in southern Asia was low, with some sporadic influenza detections reported in Iran (Islamic Republic of) and Pakistan. A decrease in influenza associated hospital rates and ILI consultation rates was seen since early October 2013 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China. Influenza positivity declined below 5 percent in November 2013 in this region. In the south of China, influenza activity decreased since early October 2013, and in the latest report, an influenza positivity level of 7.6 percent was reported. Influenza A(H3N2) virus was the main virus subtype reported, but influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were also detected.

Overall, influenza transmission in South East Asia remained at a moderate level and was variable between countries. Since early September 2013, influenza activity increased in Lao People's Democratic Republic, due to greater influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) transmission. ILI activity decreased in Thailand from early September 2013, but appeared to be at a stable level below the baseline since early November 2013. Since early November 2013, influenza detections increased again, mainly due to increased influenza A(H3N2) transmission. In Viet Nam, a decrease was seen in the number of influenza positive ILI samples and the number of positive influenza samples since early-October 2013. Cambodia reported an increase in influenza activity since mid-September 2013, mainly due to increased influenza B transmission.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate countries of South America
In the temperate countries of South America, ARI activity was reported at expected levels for the time of year with the exception of continued high ILI activity in Paraguay. RSV continued to be the most common respiratory virus detected in Argentina, although it continued its decreasing trend since its peak in July 2013. In Chile, ILI activity remained low, and the number of reported influenza cases over the past 3 weeks indicated that influenza B has predominated. In Paraguay, the ILI consultation rate was higher than expected for the time of year and has been reported as elevated since September 2013. This increased ILI activity does not correlate with levels of influenza, as influenza virus detection decreased during that time period.

Temperate countries of Southern Africa
--------------------------------------
After a peak in influenza activity in South Africa due to influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 in June 2013, a small 2nd peak was observed in September and early October 2013 due to increased influenza A(H3N2), but data from the past 3 weeks showed that influenza B recently predominated.

Oceania, Melanesia and Polynesia
--------------------------------
Overall, in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, influenza activity decreased. In Australia and New Zealand, all indicators showed a downward trend, indicating that the end of the season is near.

The Southern hemisphere winter epidemic is now over, and the Northern hemisphere winter epidemic is only just beginning to develop. Respiratory syncytial virus is now a decreasing cause of influenza-like illness in both hemispheres.

No novel influenza viruses have so far made an appearance, and the new recommended northern hemisphere vaccine is likely to be effective.

The avian-derived H5N1 and H7N9 influenza viruses remain sporadic or absent with H7N9 restricted to South China. The expected winter outbreak of seasonal influenza in Southern China has yet to make its appearance. - Mod.CP]
