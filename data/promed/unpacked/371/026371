Legionnaire's disease closes Ford plant
---------------------------------------
A Ford Motor Co. plant that makes cast iron parts for engines manufactured
in North America was closed Thursday after a third case of Legionnaire's
disease was confirmed, health officials said.
Authorities investigated 10 cases of pneumonia among workers at the
Cleveland Casting Plant in the Brook Park complex, focusing on a cooling
tower after two subcontractors who were working on the tower both contracted
pneumonia.
Two Ford workers with Legionnaire's remained hospitalized in intensive
care.
A Ford employee who had worked near the tower died of pneumonia last
Friday adding to fears the tower was the source of the bacteria. A large
tank provided steam for the 48-year-old plant's heating system and the area
was clouded in mist.
Health officials were analyzing water samples taken Tuesday and plant
managers ordered the tank be disinfected.
"Now we've got some classical exposures. We've got several people working
in and around the cooling tower, which had been down for maintenance," Tim
Horgan, Cuyahoga County health commissioner told Thursday's Cleveland Plain
Dealer.
A Ford spokesman said the decision to close the plant was made after the
third case of Legionnaire's was confirmed. The plant has 2500 employees.
Legionnaire's disease, a form of bacterial pneumonia, was first recognized
in an outbreak at a convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia in
1976. Thirty-four people died.
The legionella bacteria can be found in air conditioning systems, water
fountains and showers but most people that inhale mist from contaminated
water do not develop serious illness. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention estimates there are about 18 000 cases of Legionnaire's a year
but many are reported as pneumonia or flu of undetermined origin.
