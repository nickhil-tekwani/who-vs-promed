Foam from the mouth, unconscious, did not wake up again. Postmortem report could not be confirmed. Rural in panic with many deaths.

The death of one after another due to an unknown illness in Amravati Murtajapur-Khargipur village of Nagram has put the entire area in a shock. In such a situation, there has been a rift between the villagers. At the same time, KGMU's team arrived in Amwa Muratjapur village on [Sun 17 Jun 2018] to find out the disease. Due to the post-mortem of the dead, there is confusion on the disease.

In fact, there are 4 children from Amravati Murtajapur-Kharagpur village. In the past 2 weeks, 2 children [in one family] died from sudden illness. According to [one parent], a 2-month-old baby girl had a high fever. There are small pests [?] in the body. Understand something like that, the baby girl died. 7 days after the death of the little girl, the 2nd daughter died. [She] also had fever and light grains [rash?] on the body for 3 days. People feared measles in [the] children, but experts believe that measles is not deadly in 3 days. If the fever lasts for about 7 days and the infection reaches the child's lung, then measles causes life to be in danger.

Such deaths have occurred in the village so far:
- On [5 Jun 2018, a 13-year-old boy] suddenly became feverish. Foam came out of his mouth, and diarrhea started. [He died on the way to KGMU.]
- A [4-year-old boy suddenly became feverish] on [12 Jun 2018]. He bled from his mouth and nose and died in a short while.
- [A 32-year-old man] on [13 Jun 2018 developed confusion, which increased.] He vomited several times and died.
- 7 days ago, a 2-month-old baby girl had a high fever. There are small pests [?] in the body. Foam came out of her mouth, shortly after [she died].
- [Her 3-year-old sister] developed fever. Foam came out of her mouth and after some time the mother-in-law got stuck [?].

A post-mortem was carried out on Wednesday night [13 Jun 2018]. The body was covered with blue. Doctors could not explain the cause of death in the post-mortem. The lung, brain, and heart have been repurposed [?]. However it became clear that the child was not snatched by a serpent or a poisonous animal. The reason for death in forensic investigation is clear. At the same time, [a parent?] refused to post her child's postmortem.

[Nagram is a town with a population of 9218 residents (in 2001) in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in the Lucknow district; Nagram, located 37 km (23 mi) from Lucknow city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagram), can be found on a map at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nagram,+Uttar+Pradesh+226303,+India.

Five people, 4 of whom were children, died within a several week period of time in Nagram. 2 children were from the same household. All children were febrile; shortly before dying, "foam" came out of the mouth in 3 children -- perhaps reflecting a seizure, and bleeding from nose and mouth occurred in 1 child. Skin rashes may have been present on several of the children.

There is insufficient information to speculate on the etiological agents responsible for these febrile cases. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML]
