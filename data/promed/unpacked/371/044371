The state health department is investigating 4 cases of _E. coli_ [O157] connected with the Georgia National Fair, the DPH [Department of Public Health] announced Thursday [28 Oct 2021].

The DPH and the North Central Health District (NCHD) are working with fair staff to determine how 4 Middle Georgians who attended the annual event earlier this month [October 2021] became infected with the bacterium. "We are hoping we don't see anymore cases, but we encourage anyone that feels like they may have been infected to contact their primary care physician," said NCHD spokesperson Michael Hokanson.

All confirmed cases are children who live in Middle Georgia. Out of the 4 cases, 3 have been hospitalized. Epidemiologists are asking people who visited the Georgia National Fair between Thursday [7 Oct 2021] and Sunday [17 Oct 2021], to complete an online survey, even if they did not become ill.

NCHD and DPH have identified 4 cases of Shiga-toxin producing _E. coli_ [reported as O157 elsewhere - Mod.LL]. The symptoms of _E. coli_ include stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting and mild fever. According to the state health department, symptoms usually appear between 3 and 4 days, but incubation can last up to 10 days before symptoms. ANCHD and DPH epidemiologists are working to determine what could have caused the outbreak by comparing activities between those who became sick and those who did not. It takes some people with a mild infection a week to recover, but young children, elderly adults and people with chronic medical conditions have a higher risk of a severe illness. There is no treatment for this infection, but supportive therapy and hydration is important for recovery.

[While the source of these EHEC infections could be a food served at the fair, petting zoos often found at fairs are well recognized to be a venue for transmission of this potentially lethal toxin-producing pathogen.

The CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/features/animalexhibits/) has offered this advice regarding human-livestock interactions:
"From watching calf roping at the rodeo to petting lambs at the county fair, there are many ways to explore the animal world this spring and summer [2015]. Exhibits such as petting zoos and fairs allow children of all ages to have the thrilling experience of coming face to face with animals. This interaction allows people to learn more about animals and helps to build an important human-animal bond.

"Unfortunately, many people become sick every year because of a visit to an animal exhibit. It is important to remember that animals sometimes carry germs that are harmful to humans. When people forget to wash their hands after petting an animal or bring food into an area where animals are being housed, they are at risk for becoming ill.

"If you are visiting an animal exhibit:
- Use hand-washing stations.
- Find out where hand-washing stations are located.
- Always wash your hands after petting animals or touching the animal enclosure, especially before eating and drinking.
- Running water and soap are best. Use hand gels if running water and soap are not available.

"Food and drinks:
- Keep food and drinks out of animal areas.
- Do not share your food with animals.
- Do not eat or drink raw (unpasteurized) dairy products.

"Children:
- Children younger than 5 years old need supervision.
- Never allow children to put their hands or objects (for example, pacifiers) in their mouths while interacting with animals.
- Hand washing should be supervised." - Mod.LL
