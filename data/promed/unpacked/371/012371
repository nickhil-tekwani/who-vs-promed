[Since the last MERS-CoV update (see MERS-CoV (14): Saudi Arabia, Oman, WHO 20150124.3114951), there have been an additional 3 cases confirmed in Saudi Arabia -- 2 from Riyadh and 1 from Hafoof in the Eastern Province. The cases all had a history of pre-existing co-morbidities. Two of the 3 cases had no history of high risk exposure, while one gave a history of animal exposure. In addition, there have been 3 reported recoveries during this period -- all 3 from Riyadh. Of the 3 recoveries, the 61-year-old expat male was most likely reported as confirmed on 6 Jan 2015, at which time he was noted to be in the ICU; and the 77-year-old Saudi male may have been the individual reported as confirmed on 22 Jan 2015, at which time he was noted to be in critical condition. Both of these individuals denied high risk exposures during the 14 days preceding onset of illness. I was unable to identify further information on the 84-year-old Saudi female. Maps showing the location within Saudi Arabia can be found at the source URLs.

Today's (30 Jan 2015) MMWR has a review of the MERS-CoV situation and can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6403a4.htm?s_cid=mm6403a4_w. The data presented are in keeping with the WHO reports -- giving a global tally of 956 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 351 deaths. The report highlights that 504 of the 956 cases (52.7 percent) occurred during the period March to May 2014; an additional 102 cases were reported to WHO during the period 1 Aug 2014 through 23 Jan 2015. Of these 102 cases, 97 (95.1 percent) occurred in individuals residing in Saudi Arabia, including 3 travel-associated cases reported by Austria, Turkey, and Jordan; of the remaining cases, 2 were in persons from Qatar, and 3 cases were in persons from Oman. - Mod.MPP]
