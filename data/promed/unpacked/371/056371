N.W.T. bison anthrax outbreak largest ever in territory
-------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax has killed about 340 bison northwest of Fort Providence, N.W.T., Canada.

Officials with the territory's Department of Environment and Natural Resources say the outbreak is the largest they've seen in the N.W.T. The last big outbreak in 1994 affected 172 animals [which was also in the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary but to the east of this epidemic around Lake Falaise. - MHJ]

The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has had to bring in staff from other regions and has also hired emergency firefighters from Fort Providence to help dispose of the carcasses.

Terry Armstrong, a wildlife biologist with ENR, is asking anyone who comes across dead bison to notify the department. "The focus right now is to finish the disposal of all carcasses that we find and to make sure those sites are decontaminated as best we can," he said. "What causes an outbreak and what causes it to taper off or end is not well understood, but it seems cooler weather and rain tend to help."

People are also advised not to approach or touch the carcasses. Anthrax bacteria are found naturally in soil in the region and when hot, dry weather follows a dry season, bison can inhale their spores and become infected.

[Anthrax outbreaks in the Wood Bison National Park, the MacKenzie Bison Sanctuary, and surrounding areas usually stop with the 1st frost in about the 3rd week of September -- which, unfortunately, is still some way off.

If you go to the news link you will see workers in white overalls and hoods. This is because working with and burning these carcasses is a very dirty job. And no one wants to see these overalls in their washing machine. Instead, these heavy-duty paper overalls get tossed straight into the fire consuming the latest carcass.
