Abstract
The emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) in addition to the autochthonous tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Europe causes rising concern for public and animal health. The first equine case of West Nile neuroinvasive disease in Austria was diagnosed in 2016. As a consequence, a cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted in 2017, including 348 equids from eastern Austria [the five eastern federal states, Vienna, Burgenland, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, and Styria]. Serum samples reactive by ELISA for either flavivirus immunoglobulin G or M were further analyzed with the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT-80) to identify the specific etiologic agent. Neutralizing antibody prevalences excluding vaccinated equids were found to be 5.3% for WNV, 15.5% for TBEV, 0% for USUV, and 1.2% for WNV from autochthonous origin. Additionally, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to detect WNV nucleic acid in horse sera and was found to be negative in all cases. Risk factor analysis did not identify any factors significantly associated with seropositivity.

[The following commentary addresses animal-health aspects of the mentioned zoonozes.

1. West Nile virus (WNV) became a globally emerging disease since its transatlantic spread (1999). For many avian species, WNV infection causes no overt signs while other birds, such as American crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_) and blue jays (_Cyanocitta cristata_), often succumb to fatal systemic illness. A serious disease has been reported from domestic geese. Among mammals, clinical disease is primarily exhibited in horses and humans. Few mild cases have been recorded in sheep and alpacas.

Clinical signs of WNV infection in horses arise from viral-induced encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Infections are dependent on mosquito transmission and are seasonal in temperate climates, peaking in the early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. Affected horses frequently demonstrate mild to severe ataxia. Signs can range from slight incoordination to recumbency. Some horses exhibit weakness, muscle fasciculation, and cranial nerve deficits. Fever is not a consistently recognised feature of the disease in horses. Other equids (donkeys, mules) may suffer a similar disease course. For additional information, including diagnostic techniques and requirements for animal vaccines, see OIE's mannual at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf.

2. Tick-borne encephalitis occurs in a patchy pattern in delimited geographic areas, termed microfoci or "hotspots." In these foci, it circulates between rodents and ticks and occasionally spills over to domestic animals and humans. The domestic animals known to potentially suffer a severe disease are dogs and horses. A milder course has been reported from sheep and goats; see upper row 'TEBV' in the figure available at https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/604910/fvets-07-604910-HTML/image_m/fvets-07-604910-g003.jpg (Figure 3 in Ref 1).

In dogs, severe, often fatal neurological manifestations due to encephalitis has been described, resembling TBE disease in humans. However, high seroprevalence rates in some areas indicate that only a small proportion of infected dogs develops disease, most infections remaining asymptomatic. Because dogs usually accompany their owners, they are regarded as valuable sentinels for human TBEV risk.

TBEV infections in horses are mostly asymptomatic. However, cases of encephalomyelitis with symptoms such as anorexia, ataxia, spasms, and epileptic seizures have been described. Mild neurologic deficits may persist after recovery.

Domestic ruminants develop viraemia upon TBEV infection, usually lasting a few days, but remain mostly asymptomatic. A few clinical cases of neurologic disease in small ruminants (sheep and goats) due to TBEV have been described. Possibly, clinical cases in these species are often overlooked or misinterpreted, e.g., as _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection, and may be more common than previously thought.

Dairy animals excrete TBEV in milk during the viraemic phase, potentially leading to human infection via raw milk products like unpasteurized milk or raw milk cheese. In goat milk, infective virus can be detected for up to 19 days post-infection. Such alimentary transmission often causes clusters of cases regarded as the 2nd most important route of human infection. The above and additional information on TBE in animals is available in Ref 1.

3. USUTU virus is, similar to WNV, a flavivirus; the 2 viruses have been shown in various countries to co-circulate and share a similar bird/mosquito cycle with animals as dead-end hosts. The virus has, so far, not been found to have a clinical effect in domestic animals (antibodies detected in horses and dogs). However, the virus is highly pathogenic for several wild bird species, especially blackbirds (_Turdus merula_) and great gray owls (_Strix nebulosa_).
