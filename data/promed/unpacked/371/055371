- The 22nd meeting of the Global Commission for Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication (GCC) took place in Geneva on 28-29 Jun 2022 chaired by Professor David Salisbury. The objective of the meeting was to review progress toward eradication of WPV, including the response to the outbreak of WPV1 in southern Africa and to review progress toward stopping and preventing outbreaks of cVPDV2 among others. The meeting report is now at https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/22nd-GCC-report-20220907.pdf.

- Following the isolation of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) from environmental samples in London, UK, in May 2022, further virological and epidemiological analysis confirms circulation of this strain. No cases of paralysis associated with this strain have been detected: virus has been isolated only from environmental (sewage) samples. It is important to note that since initial isolation of VDPV2 in May [2022], local and national public health authorities have already been operating on the assumption that this strain is circulating, and as such, this official classification at this time does not affect the operational response. London and UK public health authorities continue to implement a timely and appropriate response to this circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2), in order to rapidly interrupt its circulation, including by: continuing to intensify surveillance efforts (including for potential cases of paralysis), identifying population sub-groups/areas with potential immunity gaps, offering an additional dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) to all children (aged 1-9 years of age) across London, and proactively reaching out to communities with known immunity gaps to strengthen vaccination coverage.

[As observed last week and applicable to this week, poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, continues to be identified globally. Pakistan just reported 2 new cases in the past few days: 1 in North Waziristan and 1 in Lakki Marwat (see section [2] below for more details). Last week I commented on the lack of reporting of the cVDPV2 environmental samples in the US, UK, and Israel. This week's update has the official report coming from the UK.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa): WPV1 16th and 17th cases details
Date: Wed 7 Sep 2022
Source: Outbreak News today [abridged, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/pakistan-reports-two-more-children-with-polio-total-cases-now-17-59208/


Two more children have been paralyzed by the wild poliovirus in southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The affected children include a 16-year-old boy from Lakki Marwat and a 2-year-old boy from North Waziristan, making it the 2nd case from Lakki Marwat, the 15th case from North Waziristan, and the 16th and 17th cases, respectively, from Pakistan at large this year [2022].

Both children had onset of paralysis on 9 Aug [2022], the Pakistan's National Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health Islamabad confirmed on Wed 31 Aug [2022]. The teenage boy is suffering from weakness in his left leg, while the affected child in North Waziristan had generalized body weakness and passed away later on.

"These 2 more cases are both concerning and saddening. As we saw recently with the polio case in the US, that while children under 5 are most at risk of this virus, people of any age can contract polio," said Federal Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel. "It is crucial to understand that the only protection from polio is vaccination, and this reinforces the importance of routine immunization during childhood."

"Polio will keep haunting us until we interrupt transmission," said Federal Health Secretary Dr. Muhammad Fakhre Alam. "The case of the 16-year-old boy shows how robust Pakistan's virus detection network is, because it highlights that we can identify polio cases in children outside the usually expected age," he said.

National Emergency Operations Centre Coordinator Dr. Shahzad Baig expressed his concerns about the spread of wild poliovirus as millions of people in the country are displaced. "The scale of the current calamity is absolutely devastating. As part of the polio programme, our network of health workers is here to support in every way we can, but I am deeply concerned about the virus taking a foothold as millions of people leave their homes and look for refuge elsewhere."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Genetically linked vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 has been detected in environmental samples in 3 countries and in a case of paralytic poliomyelitis. Priya Venkatesan reports.

No country is free from the risk of disease, and until an infectious disease has been eradicated globally it remains a threat everywhere. This point has been highlighted recently by the detection of poliovirus in countries deemed polio-free such as the UK, the USA, and Israel.

In the UK, in June 2022, vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) was detected in several sewage samples from north and east London taken between February and May 2022 as part of routine surveillance. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) noted that it is normal for a few vaccine-like polioviruses to be detected each year in the UK through surveillance, usually from an individual vaccinated overseas with the oral live-attenuated Sabin poliovirus vaccine (OPV) who arrives in the UK and briefly sheds traces of the vaccine virus in their faeces. However, vaccine-derived polioviruses occur when excreted virus from an individual immunised with OPV spreads and mutates in underimmunised populations. Eventually, the virus can regain sufficient neurovirulence and transmissibility to cause paralytic poliomyelitis in an unvaccinated individual. UKHSA stated that detection of VDPV2 suggests that some spread of the virus has occurred between individuals in those areas of London and urged people to ensure they were up-to-date with their vaccines.

In the USA, in July 2022, following surveillance, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) reported a case of paralytic poliomyelitis in an unvaccinated individual in the area of Rockland County. Initial sequencing by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the case resulted from VDPV2. Subsequently, on [29 Jul 2022], the Global Polio Eradication Initiative confirmed that the VDPV2 isolated from the individual in Rockland County was genetically linked to the VDPV2 detected in the London (UK) environmental samples earlier in the year, as well as to 2 Sabin-like type 2 isolates collected from environmental samples in early June [2022] in both New York and Greater Jerusalem, Israel. The Global Polio Laboratory Network reported that stool samples obtained from the individual in New York with paralytic poliomyelitis yielded a VP1 sequence with 10 mutations from Sabin 2 that was genetically linked to the sewage sequences from New York (99.34% identity), and complete capsid sequences of the isolates from Israel, the USA, and the UK showed evidence of shared genetic ancestry (>99.0% identity). The VP1 sequences from sewage samples from all 3 countries and the VP1 sequence from the individual with paralytic poliomyelitis showed genetic linkage between the isolates.

Ananda S Bandyopadhyay (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA, USA) commented: "Further investigations -- both genetic and epidemiological -- are ongoing to determine [the] possible pattern of spread of the virus and potential risk associated with these various isolates detected from different locations around the world." He continued: "Persistently high immunisation coverage in all sub-populations is definitely the key to stop paralytic outbreaks. VDPV2 cases, which did increase markedly in 2020 partly because of the 4-month pause in polio campaigns [due to] COVID-19...have gradually decreased as immunisation campaigns have restarted. However, there are still issues such as sub-optimal outbreak responses...that have hindered progress against VDPV2s."

Arshad Quddus (Polio Eradication, WHO, Geneva, Switzerland) added: "While strong vaccination coverage is imperative for all vaccine-preventable diseases, polio eradication is a must so that we can withdraw the use of OPV, which is the only vaccine that has reliably stopped polio transmission within a community."

A strong surveillance system through environmental sampling is also key to detecting polio before the virus can cause harm, as in the UK earlier this year [2022]. Bandyopadhyay said: "The detection of VDPV2 samples in the environment in the UK is somewhat unusual, but it is also [a] testament to the UK's strong polio-surveillance system. They were able to detect these samples and mount a public health response before the virus could cause paralytic disease."

In the USA, after identifying the case of paralytic polio in Rockland County, the NYSDOH launched wastewater surveillance to assess signs of the virus. They reported on [2 Aug 2022] that poliovirus was detected in samples taken not only from Rockland County, but also in samples taken from 2 different locations in Orange County [and Sullivan County; see Poliomyelitis update (36): WPV1 AFP, ES cVDPV2 AFP, ES, USA cVDPV2 20220904.8705396]. NYSDOH has called for all unvaccinated New York residents to receive a polio vaccine as soon as possible.

Quddus commented: "Under-immunised communities -- like the one in which the case was detected -- remain at high risk of continued polio spread and must be protected by quickly improving vaccination coverage in general, but targeting the high-risk communities in particular. It is critical that all children anywhere are fully immunised and protected from any poliovirus."

[As a reminder, the definitions currently used to classify VDPVs follow:
"a) Vaccine-derived poliovirus (VDPV): OPV virus strains that are > 1% divergent (or >= 10 nt changes, for types 1 and 3) or > 0.6% divergent (>= 6 NT changes, for type 2) from the corresponding OPV strain in the complete VP1 genomic region.

"b) Circulating VDPV (cVDPV): VDPV isolates for which there is evidence of person-to-person transmission in the community. The following definition was used previously to classify a VDPV as 'circulating': 'genetically linked VDPVs isolated from at least 2 AFP cases.'

"To improve the sensitivity of surveillance in detecting circulating VDPVs, the following new 'cVDPV' definition should now be used: 'genetically linked VDPVs, isolated: i) from at least 2 individuals (not necessarily AFP cases), who are not direct (i.e., household) contacts, ii) from 1 individual and 1 or more environmental surveillance (ES) samples, or iii) from 2 or more ES samples if they were collected at more than 1 distinct ES collection site (no overlapping of catchment areas), or from 1 site if collection was more than 2 months apart.'"
(https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Reporting-and-Classification-of-VDPVs_Aug2016_EN.pdf)

I've included this news report/discussion to highlight the concerns expressed globally now that there has been importations of VDPVs and cVDPVs into countries outside of the LMICs, and the concern that is now being raised. Doing a media search on Google looking for polio reports one sees how many states in the USA are evaluating their vaccination coverages and are discussing starting environmental sampling for poliovirus, as are European countries in response to the UK and Israel's positive ESs linked to the USA ESs and AFP case. Maybe now there will be serious discussion and action taken to reassess the global vaccination programs. - Mod.MPP]
