International outbreak of _Salmonella_ Stourbridge infection
------------------------------------------------------------
On 12 Jun 2005, Swedish participants in Enter-net, the international
surveillance network for the enteric infections Salmonella and VTEC O157
initiated an urgent Enter-net enquiry after an excess number of
_Salmonella_ Stourbridge [_S. enterica_ serotype Stourbridge) infections
had been observed in Sweden in May 2005. Enter-net asked members to report
any increase in reported serotype Stourbridge infections, and any recent
isolation of this serotype from food in their own countries.
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>)
3 cases of _S._ Stourbridge in Sweden were reported in May 2005, all in the
Stockholm area. Previously, only 3 cases had been observed in Sweden since
the beginning of the 1990s. The May 2005 cases were 2 females (aged 13 and
50 years) and one man (66 years). So far, there is no known connection
between the cases.
The Enter-net request of 12 Jun 2005 has so far identified _S._ Stourbridge
infections in France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, and England and Wales.
Initial analysis has revealed:
Sweden
By 21 Jul 2005, 6 cases had been identified in the Stockholm area since 1
May 2005. The cases are in a girl and 3 women (aged 13, 34, 50, 62, and 72
years) and a man (aged 66 years). 4 patients have been interviewed and no
common exposure has yet been identified. One of the cases had eaten an
unpasteurised goat's cheese from France with the brand name Le petit fiance
des Pyrenees, and _S._ Stourbridge was isolated from the remains of this
cheese.
France
The cases and investigation in France are described in a separate report
this week [see below]
Switzerland
On 24 Jun 2005, Switzerland reported that 3 isolates had been identified in
Jun 2005, all near Geneva in the French-speaking western part of the
country. 2 isolates were from humans (2 men aged 46 and 30 years) and the
other was from unpasteurised goat's cheese. Serotype Stourbridge is
extremely rare in Switzerland: only 5 isolates have been identified since
Jan 2002; 2 in 2003 and 3 in Jun 2005.
The investigation by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health is still
ongoing, and the patients are being interviewed. The human isolates were
from a patient in Geneva who reported having eaten goat's cheese before
symptom onset, but the brand name of the cheese is not known; and from a
patient in Lonay. The food isolate was taken from a Cabri ariegeois cheese
that was sold at a shop in Geneva. PFGE typing is being carried out, and
the results will be compared with typing from France and Sweden.
Germany
On 11 and 12 Jul 2005, the German national reference laboratory for
Salmonella and Other Enteric Pathogens at Wernigerode reported to Enter-net
that 2 salmonella strains had been typed as _S._ Stourbridge in June and
July 2005, one from Bayern (Bavaria) and one from Nordrhein-Westfalen. On
12 July, Germany reported that 2 cases had been identified in Jun 2005, in
2 women in Fridolfing (southern Germany) and Koln (western Germany).
By 20 Jul 2005, 8 infections with _S._ Stourbridge have been reported to
the national surveillance system at the Robert Koch-Institut (RKI). One of
the cases is asymptomatic and for another case, no information on symptoms
are available. In the same period for 2001-2004, between 1 and 4 infections
with _S._ Stourbridge were reported. By 20 Jul 2005, only 1 of the 2 cases
for which strains had been diagnosed at the national reference laboratory
had been reported to the national surveillance system. Therefore, at least
9 people are known to have been infected with serotype Stourbridge in
Germany in 2005. France is mentioned as the probable country of infection
for 1 of the 4 infections that have been reported since mid-May 2005. This
case was in a woman who had visited the south of France and eaten goat
cheese, although she could not remember the brand of the cheese. The food
history of another recent case revealed that the patient had not eaten any
cheese in the days before symptom onset. Investigations are continuing.
Austria
On 14 Jul 2005, Austria reported that 3 cases had been identified since
mid-June 2005. The cases were a 13 month old baby girl, a 32 year old woman
and a 51 year old man.
Since mid-June, 5 cases of _S._ Stourbridge have been identified in
Austria. Investigations are continuing, and the patients are being
interviewed. One of the cases had eaten an unpasteurized goat's cheese from
France sold under the brand name Vacherin de chevre in the days before
symptom onset. A 2nd patient also mentioned consumption of French goat's
cheese as a possible source of infection, but he was not able to give
details about the brand or the supplier.
England and Wales
3 cases of _S._ Stourbridge infection have been reported in England and
Wales in 2005 as of 20 Jul 2005. This compares with an average annual
incidence of 3 cases based on the preceding 4 years (range 2 to 4 cases).
All 3 cases in 2005 were in women whose infections were confirmed in West
Midlands laboratories during Jun and Jul 2005. The women were 21, 57 and 62
years old and none had a known history of foreign travel.
Control measures
On 6 Jul 2005, the Swedish health authorities informed the health
authorities in other European countries, via the European Rapid Alert
System for Food and Feed (RASFF,
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/food/rapidalert/index_en.htm>) of the
isolation of serotype Stourbridge from the remains of a French cheese sold
under the name Le petit fiance des Pyrenees. An investigation of the
producer of this cheese was carried out by the French veterinary services.
It showed that the goat's cheese sold under the brand name Le petit fiance
des Pyrenees that has been incriminated in Sweden and the Cabri ariegeois
incriminated in Switzerland were made by the same producer.
In France, all batches of the goat's cheese brands Cabri ariegeois and Le
petit fiance des Pyrenees have been withdrawn. The producer of these 2
cheeses also makes a generic kind of goat's cheese known as a 'tomme', and
all 'tomme' cheese from this producer has been withdrawn. The producer had
been making all 3 of these cheeses from the unpasteurized milk of a single
herd of 260 goats. A warning for the public was disseminated by the
national press on 13 Jul 2005 and notices were posted at points of purchase.
In Switzerland, Cabri ariegeois cheese has been banned from sale. Le petit
fiance des Pyrenees cheese is not imported into Switzerland.
In Sweden, Le petit fiance des Pyrenees goat's cheese has been banned by
the environment and health protection administration in Stockolm and
Uppsala. The Livsmedelsverket, the Swedish national food administration,
has informed the public about the product on its website [2].
Background
_S. enterica_ Stourbridge is a very rare serotype, with a total of 80 cases
reported in Europe in the previous 6 years (for figure, see above URL).
This represents just 0.012 per cent (80 out of 671 777 cases) in the
Enter-net salmonella database. The annual number of cases range from 6
(2002) to 20 (2001), with the number of cases reported in 2003 and 2004
stable at 16 per year. The country isolating this serotype most often is
France, which has recognized 61 out of the 80 cases (76.25 per cent). In
2003, 1 case from England and Wales was associated with travel to France,
and in 2001 a case from Sweden was associated with travel to Lebanon.

Cases of _Salmonella_ Stourbridge infection in France, April-June 2005
---------------------------------------------------
Following the Enter-net request for information on recent cases of _S.
enterica_ serotype Stourbridge infection reported in Europe, the national
reference centre (CNR) for Salmonella at the Institut Pasteur in Paris has
so far identified 18 cases, and 16 of the patients have been interviewed.
This number is far higher than that usually observed in France (10 cases
per year). These 18 patients are resident in 13 different administrative
departments, with clusters in Ile de France (6 cases), Brittany (5 cases)
and Midi-Pyrenees (3 cases) (Figure 1, see above URL).
The 16 patients interviewed developed symptoms between 18 Apr and 22 Jun
2005 (Figure 2). 3 of the 6 cases detected since 30 May 2005 live in 3
contiguous administrative departments in the Midi-Pyrenees in southern
France (Figure 1). A 4th case living in Haute-Vienne had spent the 5 days
before symptom onset on holiday in Ariege (Midi-Pyrenees).
Case characteristics
Both sexes (6 males and 12 females) and all age groups (5 children aged
under 5 years, 2 children 5-14 years, 9 adults 15-64 years and 2 adults
over 65 years) were affected. The age range varied from 1 to 79 years
(median age: 55 years). Patients presented with diarrhea (16 cases, 100 per
cent, 3 of whom had bloody diarrhea), abdominal pain (12 cases, 75 per
cent), and fever (10 cases, 62 per cent). 2 cases were admitted to
hospital. 1 patient died from causes unrelated to salmonella infection; all
other cases have recovered.
Food investigation
The food consumption histories for 16 cases did not reveal any common food
item. The raw milk goat's cheese Le petit fiance des Pyrenees which was
incriminated in Sweden was consumed by 1 case living in Ariege. She ate
this cheese every day in the week preceding symptom onset on 22 Jun 2005. 3
of 4 other household members who also ate this cheese every day presented
with gastroenteritis at the same time, but did not provide stool samples,
and therefore cannot be confirmed to have had _S._ Stourbridge infection.
In the days before symptom onset (9 Jun 2005), another case ate a generic
type of cheese known as a 'tomme', made from goat's milk, that had been
bought while on holiday in Ariege, but of unknown provenance. The producer
who made the Le petit fiance des Pyrenees brand cheese (incriminated in
Sweden) and Cabri ariegeois (incriminated in Switzerland) also made goat's
milk 'tomme' cheese.
The questionnaires completed by the other 2 recent cases living in
Midi-Pyrenees did not show consumption of Le petit fiance des Pyrenees or
Cabri ariegeois or goat's milk 'tomme' cheese. One case reported eating
cheese from the Pyrenees, but did not give more details; another case
reported eating goat's cheese every day, but could not remember having
eaten cheese from Ariege.
The local veterinary services have isolated Salmonella from all 7 batches
of goat's cheese tested. The samples included Le petit fiance des Pyrenees
and Cabri ariegeois cheese, and a 'tomme' cheese from the same producer,
and the goat's milk used to make these cheese. _S._ Stourbridge has so far
been confirmed in 4 of the contaminated batches and serotyping results are
awaited for the other 3 batches. All these cheeses were made from the
unpasteurized milk of a single herd of 260 goats.
Control measures
----------------
In France, all batches of goat's cheese sold under the names Cabri
ariegeois, Le petit fiance des Pyrenees and goat's milk 'tomme; cheese
produced the manufacturer of Cabri ariegeois and Le petit fiance des
Pyrenees have been withdrawn. A warning for the public was disseminated by
the national press on 13 Jul 2005 and notices were posted at points of
purchase.
Conclusion
----------
Based on the information available so far, the excess of _S._ Stourbridge
infections observed by CNR in France since Apr 2005 was in 2 episodes. An
episode of cases in Apr and May 2005 occurred mainly in Brittany and Ile de
France, and investigation has not found a common source; in particular, the
cheeses Cabri ariegeois and Le petit fiance des Pyrenees which caused cases
in Sweden and Switzerland were not eaten by these French cases. The 2nd
episode of 4 cases involved patients living in or having spent time in
Midi-Pyrenees; the consumption of Le petit fiance des Pyrenees was found
for 1 case and the consumption of goat's milk 'tomme' cheese that may have
been produced by the same producer was probable for another case.
