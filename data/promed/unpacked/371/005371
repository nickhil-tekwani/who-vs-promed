What to know
- 73 children in New York state have been diagnosed with a recently identified illness associated with COVID-19 that some doctors are referring to as "pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome".
- Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday [8 May 2020] that a 5 year old boy in New York City died on Thursday [7 May 2020 from the condition, and Westchester officials confirmed that a 2nd death, last week, of a 7 year old boy, was under investigation.
- Doctors say in some cases, kids are taking up to 6 weeks after exposure to the virus to present with symptoms of this illness.

New York now has 73 cases of children presenting with a new pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome likely linked to COVID-19 -- and at least one child has died of the condition and a 2nd death is under investigation, officials said on Friday [8 May 2020]. Westchester officials [say] it may be too early to determine whether the 7 year old boy died from complications of COVID-19 or from other underlying medical issues.

The state issued an advisory notice on the syndrome and its potential association with COVID-19 in children on Wednesday [6 May 2020] afternoon. It was sent to all healthcare facilities, clinical labs and local health departments in the state to inform providers of the condition as well as to provide testing and reporting guidance. Any suspected cases of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome in people under the age of 21 must be reported to the State Department of Health.

As the advisory stated, "Though most children who get COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms, in the United Kingdom, a possible link has also been reported between pediatric COVID-19 and serious inflammatory disease. The inflammatory syndrome has features that overlap with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome and may occur days to weeks after acute COVID-19 illness. It can include persistent fever, abdominal symptoms, rash, and even cardiovascular symptoms requiring intensive care. Early recognition by pediatricians and referral to a specialist including to critical care is essential."

New York City issued its own health alert earlier this week (see section [3] below) after identifying more than a dozen children in city hospitals who have the rare illness. At least one expert believes there are sure to be more kids affected. The syndrome has been observed in 15 children who were hospitalized from [17 Apr 2020] to [1 May 2020] in the city, according to Demetre Daskalakis, the deputy commissioner of disease control with the New York City Health Department. While the full spectrum of the illness is not yet known, Daskalakis said, features of Kawasaki disease and toxic shock have been seen in patients between the ages of 2 and 15.

Doctors at a Long Island children's hospital have noticed that at least a dozen child patients with connections to COVID-19 over the past few weeks have gotten sick, all with the same. "We've seen more than 15.... We're seeing them every day that have required ICU admission every day," said Dr Steven Kernie, professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and chief of critical care medicine at New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. He said they are seeing one or 2 children every day with similar symptoms.

"What we're seeing is children who have had high fever -- over 102 or 103 -- for 3 to 4 days," Kernie added. "They tend to have a rash anywhere on their body, including the palms of their hands and soles of their feet. They may have abdominal distress. Their eyes may be very red. They look ill." He believes this is not a primary infection, but the child's immune response to exposures that took place weeks earlier. Four of the 15 children tested positive for COVID-19, and 6 tested positive for the coronavirus antibodies, signifying a previous infection.

The city's health department may only be recognizing severe cases at this point, but one doctor familiar with the illness believes there will be many more to come. "This is happening all through Europe," Dr Jane Newburger, director of the Kawasaki Program at Boston Children's Hospital, told NBC News. "It is definitely happening in various cities on the East Coast and in some parts of the Midwest." Newburger said the illness may come as a "post-immune reaction to COVID," meaning the body seemingly overcompensates and essentially keeps fighting a disease that is no longer attacking the body -- possibly even weeks after having contracted a virus like COVID-19.

New York City mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted on Tuesday [5 May 2020] afternoon about the cases found in the city, saying that while "we haven't seen any fatalities yet, but we are very concerned by what we're seeing. We're learning more every day about how COVID-19 affects the body. This is a ferocious disease." The mayor also said the city would require healthcare providers to report any cases of people under 21 being treated for these symptoms.

So what are the symptoms of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome? The NYC Health Department said that all 15 children had a fever, and more than half reported having rashes, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea. While it has been considered a direct symptom of COVID-19, less than half of the pediatric patients in the city displayed any shortness of breath.

Any child that shows symptoms relating to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible, as the health department said early recognition and a pediatrician's referral to a specialist are essential, including admission to critical care units if necessary. Beginning treatment quickly can help prevent end-organ damage and other long-term problems, Daskalakis said in the city's medical alert. Dr Newburger suggests that any parent who finds their child to have a high fever and "seems unwell" should call their pediatrician and seek medical attention.

Mount Sinai Hospital previously confirmed reports by NBC New York that they are seeing the new and unusual COVID-19-related illness in several pediatric patients, up from just 2 on [26 Apr 2020]. The hospital's chief of pediatric critical care issued a warning to parents to be on the lookout for certain symptoms. In a statement, Dr George Ofori, pediatric critical care director at Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital said, "Some of the cases that we are currently treating entered our care presenting with symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and a low-grade fever. Others presented first with a rash, conjunctivitis, and/or cracked lips."

Dr Ofori said some patients have developed heart problems and low blood pressure that led to shock. He explained that some had been diagnosed with COVID-19 2-3 weeks before these symptoms developed. "Whether the underlying condition is COVID-19 or the body's response to COVID-19 is not known at this time. While it is too early to definitively say what is causing this, we believe it is important to alert the public as to what we are seeing," he said.

A different source told NBC New York some of these children had no previous underlying health conditions.

The Mount Sinai statement came 2 days after Dr Ofori's counterpart at Cohen Children's Hospital on Long Island told the I-Team in an interview they've seen about a dozen critically ill pediatric patients in the past weeks with similar inflammatory symptoms. "We now have at least about 12 patients in our hospital that are presenting in a similar fashion, that we think have some relation to a [COVID-19] infection," said Dr James Schneider, director of pediatric critical care at Cohen Children's Hospital in Nassau. "It's something we're starting to see around the country."

Cohen is one of several local hospitals where pediatricians say they're concerned about recent hospitalizations of previously healthy children who have become critically ill with the same features, resembling toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, an autoimmune sickness that can be triggered by a viral infection and if not treated quickly, can cause life-threatening damage to the arteries and the heart.

[2] USA (multistate): 1st USA death

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/boy-5-dies-covid-19-linked-inflammatory-syndrome-n1203076


A 5 year old boy in New York has become the 1st child in the USA to die from a condition called pediatric multisymptom inflammatory syndrome that is believed to be linked to COVID-19.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo said during a briefing on Friday [8 May 2020] that the state department of health is investigating several related cases in children. "This would be really painful news and would open an entirely different chapter," Cuomo said. "This is an extremely rare and previously unknown presentation of COVID-19 in children," the Mount Sinai Health System said in a statement. "We extend our deepest condolences to the family in the wake of this tragedy."

Nationwide, nearly 100 children have been diagnosed with the newly identified syndrome. At least 8 states -- California, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington -- as well as Washington DC, have reported cases.

Pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome can mirror symptoms of other inflammatory illnesses, such as Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome.

New York health officials urged parents to seek immediate care if a child has:
- Prolonged fever (more than 5 days)
- Difficulty feeding (infants) or is too sick to drink fluids
- Severe abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting
- Change in skin color -- becoming pale, patchy and/or blue
- Trouble breathing or is breathing very quickly
- Racing heart or chest pain
- Decreased amount of frequency in urine
- Lethargy, irritability or confusion

Most concerning is that children can develop problems with heart function. The heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. The problem appears to be the result of a child's immune system going into overdrive after a COVID-19 infection.

Many, but not all, children with the condition have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. At a news conference with Westchester County, New York, officials on Friday [8 My 2020], doctors said some children don't develop symptoms until a month after exposure to the virus.

A 14-year-old boy in the UK has also died from the inflammatory syndrome. His and other such cases in Europe were detailed in a report published this week in The Lancet (see section [4] below).

Health advisory: pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
- Recently, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been reported as possibly linked with a pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome disease -- "pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome [PMIS] potentially associated with COVID-19".
- As of 5 May 2020, 64 suspected pediatric clinical cases compatible with multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19 have been reported in children in New York State hospitals, including New York City.
- Hospitals must immediately report cases of PMIS potentially associated with COVID-19 in patients who are under 21 years of age to the New York State Department of Health (NYS DOH) through the Health Emergency Response Data System (HERDS) application on the health commerce system (HCS) and perform a diagnostic and serological test to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or corresponding antibodies in the patient.

Advisory
- The purpose of this health advisory is to (1) ensure providers are aware of the PMIS potentially associated with COVID-19 and (2) provide guidance on reporting of cases to NYS DOH and testing of patients who present with this disease.
- Please note that while older adults are at risk for severe COVID-19 illness, children can still get sick with COVID-19, most often presenting with mild symptoms, but rarely becoming severely ill.
- In the UK and Europe, a possible link has been reported between COVID-19 and a serious inflammatory disease recently termed "pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19".
- As of 5 May 2020, 64 suspected pediatric clinical cases compatible with multisystem inflammatory syndrome have been reported in children in New York State hospitals, including New York City.
- This syndrome has features that overlap with Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Inflammatory markers may be elevated, and fever and abdominal symptoms may be prominent. Rash also may be present. Myocarditis and other cardiovascular changes may be seen.
Additionally, some patients have developed cardiogenic or vasogenic shock and required intensive care. This inflammatory syndrome may occur days to weeks after acute COVID-19 illness.
- The syndrome may include:

-- A child presenting with persistent fever, inflammation (for example, neutrophilia, elevated C-reactive protein and lymphopenia) and evidence of single or multiorgan dysfunction (shock, cardiac, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal or neurological disorder). This may include children meeting full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease.
-- Exclusion of any other microbial cause, including bacterial sepsis, staphylococcal or streptococcal shock syndromes, and infections associated with myocarditis such as enterovirus. Clinicians should not delay seeking expert advice while waiting for results of these investigations.

- Early recognition by pediatricians and prompt referral to an in-patient specialist, including to critical care, is essential.
- This syndrome should be considered by pediatricians and specialists, particularly when other microbial etiologies have not been identified.
- Pediatricians and specialists should elicit any recent history of illness with COVID-19 or close contact with individuals who are known to have COVID-19 in children presenting with symptoms that are compatible with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with COVID-19.
- The majority of patients who have presented with this syndrome have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or corresponding antibodies. Some tested positive on diagnostic, molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2; others were positive on serological testing for corresponding antibodies.

Reporting and testing
- Hospitals must immediately report cases of PMIS potentially associated with COVID-19 in patients who are under 21 years of age to NYS DOH through the Health Emergency Response Data System (HERDS) application on the health commerce system (HCS).
- Hospitals must perform a diagnostic and serological test to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or corresponding antibodies in patients who are under 21 year of age and present with symptoms compatible with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with COVID-19.

Riphagen S, Gomez X, Gonzalez-Martinez C, et al. Hyperinflammatory shock in children during COVID-19 pandemic. Lancet. Epub 7 May 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)31094-1


South Thames Retrieval Service in London, UK, provides paediatric intensive care support and retrieval to 2 million children in South East England. During a period of 10 days in mid-April 2020, we noted an unprecedented cluster of 8 children with hyperinflammatory shock, showing features similar to atypical Kawasaki disease, Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (1), or toxic shock syndrome (typical number is one or 2 children per week). This case cluster formed the basis of a national alert.

All children were previously fit and well. Six of the children were of Afro-Caribbean descent, and 5 of the children were boys. All children except one were well above the 75th centile for weight. Four children had known family exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Demographics, clinical findings, imaging findings, treatment, and outcome for this cluster of 8 children are shown in the Table [available at the source URL].

Clinical presentations were similar, with unrelenting fever (38-40 deg C), variable rash, conjunctivitis, peripheral oedema, and generalised extremity pain with significant gastrointestinal symptoms. All progressed to warm, vasoplegic shock, refractory to volume resuscitation and eventually requiring noradrenaline and milrinone for haemodynamic support. Most of the children had no significant respiratory involvement, although 7 of the children required mechanical ventilation for cardiovascular stabilisation. Other notable features (besides persistent fever and rash) included development of small pleural, pericardial, and ascitic effusions, suggestive of a diffuse inflammatory process.

All children tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal aspirates. Despite being critically unwell, with laboratory evidence of infection or inflammation (3) including elevated concentrations of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, ferritin, triglycerides, and D-dimers, no pathological organism was identified in 7 of the children. Adenovirus and enterovirus were isolated in one child.

Baseline electrocardiograms were nonspecific; however, a common echocardiographic finding was echo-bright coronary vessels [see Appendix at source URL], which progressed to giant coronary aneurysm in one patient within a week of discharge from paediatric intensive care (Appendix). One child developed arrhythmia with refractory shock, requiring extracorporeal life support, and died from a large cerebrovascular infarct. The myocardial involvement (2) in this syndrome is evidenced by very elevated cardiac enzymes during the course of illness.

All children were given intravenous immunoglobulin (2 g/kg) in the first 24 h, and antibiotic cover including ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Subsequently, 6 children have been given 50 mg/kg aspirin. All of the children were discharged from PICU after 4-6 days. Since discharge, 2 of the children have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (including the child who died, in whom SARS-CoV-2 was detected post mortem). All children are receiving ongoing surveillance for coronary abnormalities.

We suggest that this clinical picture represents a new phenomenon affecting previously asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome. The multifaceted nature of the disease course underlines the need for multispecialty input (intensive care, cardiology, infectious diseases, immunology, and rheumatology).

The intention of this correspondence is to bring this subset of children to the attention of the wider paediatric community and to optimise early recognition and management. As this Correspondence goes to press, one week after the initial submission, the Evelina London Children's Hospital paediatric intensive care unit has managed more than 20 children with similar clinical presentation, the first 10 of whom tested positive for antibody (including the original 8 children in the cohort described above).

[Since the 1st alert issued by the PICS (Paediatric Intensive Care Society, UK) on 27 Apr 2020, the pediatric health sector has switched into a "seek and ye shall find" mode, and cases are being found. In less than 2 weeks, at least 100 cases have been found combined in the USA and in Europe. While not all cases have laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is known that there is a false-negative rate for PCR testing and the array of serologic tests available has been released without guaranteed gold standard testing on all of the tests commercially available. In addition is the observation that a number of children present with symptoms 3-4 weeks after the acute infection when the viral infection per se has been cleared. Given the widespread transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in both the USA and Europe (especially the UK, Italy, Spain, and Germany), the association of this syndrome with the ongoing pandemic is not surprising. There is much to learn about the impact of this virus, especially on the pediatric population that we thought was spared. As I've said before, it's a very nasty virus and keeps coming up with new destructive manifestations. - Mod.MPP
