Health officials are working to determine how 4 people contracted legionnaire's disease while hospitalized last year [2021] at Phelps Health in Rolla [Missouri, USA], the state health department announced Tuesday [25 Jan 2022]. The 4 patients were hospitalized between May and December of last year [2021], the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said.

The health department said it is advising healthcare workers and the public who might have had contact with a water source at the hospital about the cases "out of an abundance of caution."

Legionnaire's disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by inhaling small water droplets containing _Legionella_ bacteria. It is generally not spread from person to person.

The health department is collaborating with Phelps Health to prevent additional infections and ensure early detection of cases, Dr George Turabelidze, state epidemiologist, said in a news release.

Phelps Health is also working with its water monitoring company for continued testing of its water system and is contacting providers about the possibility of _Legionella_ transmission. "At Phelps Health, the health and safety of our patients, visitors, and staff are our top priorities," Phelps Health President and CEO Jason Shenefield said. "We will continue collaborating with our partners to help investigate these cases."

[_Legionella_ are Gram-negative bacteria that embed in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of a building's plumbing system pipes and containers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop legionnaires' disease following aspiration of legionella-contaminated potable water, as well as following inhalation of a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources within the hospital that contain _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes JP, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ in hospital outbreaks, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume sterile water only until _Legionella_ are not detectable by culture of the hospital water (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/wmp/control-toolkit/routine-testing.html).

How the 4 cases of legionnaires' disease in hospitalized patients were determined to be linked is not stated. Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify a common source outbreak. It may be only that the 4 developed _Legionella_ pneumonia while hospitalized in the same facility or that in addition, genotyping of the clinical isolates was done and the genotypes of the clinical isolates "matched". A common source can then be confirmed if the genotype of the clinical isolates matches the genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from the hospital's water system. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Phelps Health includes a 242-bed hospital that serves a 6-county area, with its main campus and several clinics located in Rolla, Missouri (https://phelpshealth.org/about-phelps-health). The city of Rolla (pop., almost 20 000 residents in 2020); Rolla, the county seat of Phelps County, is located about midway between the cities of St Louis and Springfield, Missouri, along highway I-44 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolla,_Missouri).
