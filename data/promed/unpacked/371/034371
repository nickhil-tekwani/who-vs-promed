Negative tests for plum pox
---------------------------
A suspected incident of Plum pox potyvirus [PPV] has almost certainly been
ruled out in tests conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry
(MAF) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
Samples from a single non-commercial plum tree in the Waikato region were
extensively tested by MAF and sent to the USDA on 18 Mar 2003 for further
verification after initial results in New Zealand were negative. Several
assays including ELISA and PCR were used in the test protocol.
Plum pox is a notifiable disease under the Biosecurity Act 1993 in New
Zealand. 4 PPV strains are known. The disease is commonly spread by
grafting and by aphids and can devastate fruit-bearing varieties from the
Prunus family including peaches, apricots, plums, nectarines, almonds, and
cherries, reducing yield and rendering fruit unmarketable.

[The original newspaper report (18 Mar 2003, New Zealand Herald) indicated
that New Zealand's stonefruit crop is worth NZD 70 million (USD 37.8
million). Once established in New Zealand, the disease would be almost
impossible to contain, because PPV is efficiently transmitted by various
aphid species as well as by grafting. The nature of the suspected plum
pox-like disease remains unknown. Do any of our readers have information on
this aspect? - Mod.DH]
