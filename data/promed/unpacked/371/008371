Case Count Update
-----------------
Since the last update on 20 Nov 2015, 7 more ill people have been reported from California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1). 52 people infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O26 have been reported from 9 states. The majority of illnesses have been reported from Washington and Oregon during October 2015. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: California (3), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Minnesota (2), New York (1), Ohio (3), Oregon (13), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (27).

Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from 19 Oct 2015 to 13 Nov 2015. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 94, with a median age of 21. 59 percent of ill people are female. 20 (38 percent) people reported being hospitalized. There have been no reports of hemolytic uremic syndrome and no deaths.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them.

Investigation Update
--------------------
State and local public health officials continue to interview ill people to obtain information about foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week before their illness started. To date, 47 (90 percent) of 52 people interviewed reported eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant. Of the 3 most recent illnesses reported in November 2015, only 1 ill person, whose illness started on 10 Nov 2015, reported eating at Chipotle Mexican Grill in the week before their illness began. The investigation is still ongoing to identify common meal items or ingredients causing illness.

Investigators are also using whole genome sequencing, an advanced laboratory technique, to get more information about the DNA fingerprint of the EHEC O26 bacteria causing illness. To date, whole genome sequencing has been performed on EHEC O26 isolates from 21 ill people in Washington (16), California (2), Minnesota (2), and New York (1). All 21 isolates were highly related genetically to one another. This provides additional evidence that illnesses outside the Pacific Northwest are related to the illnesses in Oregon and Washington.

Updates will be provided when more information is available.

[The vehicle for transmission of the EHEC O26 is not clear as yet and it can be difficult to determine in Mexican restaurants epidemiologically since many of the usual suspects are stored, served and eaten together. That some of the new cases are not linked to the Chipotle restaurant chain may make it possible to identify the vehicle. - Mod.LL
