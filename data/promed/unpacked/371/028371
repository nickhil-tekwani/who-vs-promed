As Iran struggles with cholera, as of Tue 23 Aug 2005, 11 persons died and
819 others were infected, said the Director of Contagious Diseases
Directorate Dr. Mahmoud Suroush.
In press statements, Suroush said an Afghan [died from] cholera due to
negligence of seeking medical treatment, hiking the number of deaths to 11
since the bacterium's breakout in the beginning of August 2005.
As for the breakdown of the 819 infected persons, he said 186 were in
Tehran, 150 in Qum, 123 in Gulstan, 108 in Hamadan, 73 in Qazwin, 40 in
Gilan, 36 in Kashan, 19 in Asfahan, 19 in Zanjan, 15 in Kirmanshah, 15 in
Arak, 12 in Sari, 4 in Babil and Simnan, as well as 3 in Shahroud. Sistan,
Laristan, Mashhad and Zabul each had 2 cases, while Yazd, Kurdistan,
Azerbaijan and Bu Shahar each had a single case.
People, he said, are urged to ensure the cleanliness of vegetables and
drinking water, as well as not to eat any food from street vendors.

The total number of sick Dogubeyazit residents going to hospitals as a
result of a diarrhea epidemic, which has already led to 2 deaths, has
reached 1722. Local administrator Rauf Ulusoy said the number was
mistakenly announced as 4700 due to lack of a computerized system, and
assured that the genuine figure is 1722. "The main thing is that none of
the diarrhea cases are toxic. We have taken preventive measures at
hospitals and have enough medicine in stock," said Ulusoy.
According to a Dogan News Agency report, some people who had drunk tap
water from the city system checked into health centers with symptoms of
diarrhea, including vomiting, from 1-20 Aug 2005. Unfortunately, a
77-year-old and a 44-year-old both died despite intensive efforts by
hospital medical staff. "Of 46 people who were staying in hospitals
overnight, 20 have been discharged. Treatment continues for the others, 8
of whom are children. We transferred 3 patients to Igdyr, 2 to Van and one
to Erzurum. None of our current patients face a risk of death."
Ulusoy said the epidemic was caused by contaminated water and they will
deliver clean water to the people.
Dogubeyazit Mayor Mukaddes Kubilay claimed the water was not the only
problem. She said they treated the water with chlorine tablets after
chlorinating machines broke down. Kubilay pointed out that the diarrhea
struck a village where the city water is not used and added that one person
that died was from that particular village.

Faced with an alarming increase in cholera outbreaks in West Africa this
summer [2005], the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) has convened a regional meeting of UN agencies and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) working to arrest the spread of the disease.
The meeting, to be held early next week [final week August 2005] in Dakar,
Senegal will assess the scope of the outbreak and action to date and agree
on priority actions to enhance future response to the acute intestinal
infection caused by consuming contaminated food or water. It can quickly
cause severe dehydration leading to death, although a simple mix of water,
sugar and salts is enough to save many lives.
According to OCHA's regional office for West Africa, the total number of
cholera cases recorded in the sub-region in 2005 stands at 24 621. There
have been 401 deaths due to the disease in affected countries, including
Burkina Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and
Senegal.
The country hardest hit is Guinea-Bissau, where both the number of affected
persons and the number of deaths have nearly doubled in the last 2 weeks.
Some 110 new cases of cholera continue to be diagnosed daily. The
Government appealed for USD 104 000 in international assistance 2 weeks
ago. Donations of medicine have been received from France and Portugal, but
the need for additional assistance continues.

The cholera outbreak in the capital of Burkina Faso has left 6 dead and at
least 236 ill and has now spread to the west of Ouagadougou, according to
new figures reported by public radio. At the end of last week [3rd week
August 2005], the epidemic reached Koudougou, about 100 km (60 miles) west
of the capital, where at least 5 cases have been reported, according to the
radio.
Mobile health teams have scoured the city's affected neighborhoods to
disinfect the homes of the cholera victims. For several days, national
television has broadcast an awareness campaign on how to prevent the spread
of cholera and the need to take people suspected of having the disease to
the nearest health centers.

A cholera outbreak in a convoy of soldiers traveling with their families in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has killed at least 16 people
and infected hundreds, aid officials said on Fri 26 Aug 2005. Humanitarian
workers expressed concern that the convoy of about 3000 people had dealt
with the outbreak by dropping off hundreds of infected people in villages
along the way, exposing local residents to the risk of infection.
"So far, we are looking at 16 dead and over 300 infected," an aid worker
said of the convoy, traveling from the town of Goma in North Kivu province
to Bunia town in Ituri region.
Another official, Patrick Lavand'Homme, head of the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in North Kivu, said aid agencies in
the town of Beni, where the convoy had temporarily halted, were trying to
tackle the crisis.
"We are concerned about the cholera spreading. There are about 3000
soldiers and their families in the convoy," said Lavand'Homme. "The
conditions were terrible in the trucks and contamination happened very fast."
A UN official in Goma said local authorities in the town declared a cholera
epidemic there about 2 weeks ago [2nd week August 2005].
"It appears infected people were among the thousands of soldiers, women and
children that joined the 60-truck convoy," the U.N. official said.

A total of 805 people in Gulu have contracted cholera, which hit the
district early in 2005. 10 of them have died since the outbreak.
Gulu's Lacor Hospital epidemiologist Dr. Zebulon Yoti, however, said
cholera cases were declining in the district. He said Pabbo had the highest
number of cholera cases with 530 reported patients, followed by Atiak with
96, Lacor Hospital with 65, while Gulu Hospital had 58 cases and Amuru had 56.
Meanwhile, cholera cases in Kotido district are increasing. Cumulative
statistics from the health department put the figure at 153 cases, of which
123 are females. Kotido District Health Educator Michael Lochiyo
attributed the high infection rates among the women to their household
work, community service and child caring obligations.
The District Director for Health Services, Dr, Louis Okio Talamoe, told a
district technical and planning committee meeting on Wed 17 Aug 2005 that
all the sub-counties in Jie county had reported cholera cases. He said
Panyangara sub-county was the worst affected, but did not give figures.

Health officials and local leaders in Buliisa sub-county, Masindi district,
have suspended all social activities in the area following a cholera
outbreak, which has claimed one life. 17 other victims were over the
weekend [20-21 Aug 2005] admitted to Butiaba health unit. All the affected
are members of the fishing community in Butiaba on Lake Albert.
The deputy resident district commissioner, Hussein Kato Matanda, was, on
Sat 20 Aug 2005, forced to halt 2 wedding ceremonies in Buliisa in a bid to
minimize the chances of the disease spreading.
"We have apologized to the people who had organized the weddings and
explained to them the gravity of the problem. We are also planning to close
down all eating places which do not meet the minimum sanitation standards,"
Matanda said on Sun 21 Aug 2005 while addressing Butiaba parish residents.
The in-charge Buliisa health sub-district, Dr. Malo, said arrangements were
being made to take more nurses and doctors to Butiaba to help the
overwhelmed the workers there.
Matanda blamed the outbreak on the poor sanitary conditions in the fishing
community.

Cholera in West Africa 26 August 2005
------------------------
The current wave of cholera outbreaks started several weeks ago in West
Africa. So far, 31 259 cases and 517 deaths have been reported in 8
countries [see map at URL link above]. Seasonal factors, such as the rainy
season, along with population movements in the area contribute to this
unusually high incidence of cholera.
WHO, with international and national health partners, is providing
technical support to the ministries of health at the country and
sub-regional level. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance activities.
Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also been
dispatched to some of the countries.
Breakdown by country:
Burkina Faso: 295 cases including 8 deaths (case fatality rate -CFR 2.7
percent) have been reported in Ouagadougou town as of 22 Aug [2005],
affecting sectors of the town with precarious water and sanitation conditions.
Guinea: 571 cases including 32 deaths (CFR 5.6 percent) have been reported
between mid-July and 4 Aug [2005]. Control efforts are ongoing.
Guinea-Bissau: 9047 cases including 172 deaths (CFR 1.9 percent) occurred
between 6 Jun and 21 Aug [2005]in the country. The regions of Bissau and
Bimbo account for 83 percent of cases; cholera is now spreading to remote
areas with 10 regions out of 11 affected.
Liberia: 703 cases including 29 deaths (CFR 4.1 percent) have been reported
for the period from 1 to 21 Aug [2005], including Sinoe County.
Mali: 158 cases including 20 deaths (CFR 12.65 percent) have occurred
between 20 Jun and 24 Jul [2005]. The situation appears to be under
control, although cholera is an ongoing problem in Mali.
Mauritania: 497 cases including 10 deaths (CFR 2 percent) have been
reported in Nouakchott from 20 Jul to 10 Aug [2005]. The country reported a
total of 717 cases from early May to 12 Aug [2005] occurring in 4 regions (
Brakna, Guidimakha, Nouakchott, and Traza).
Niger: 125 cases including 15 deaths (CFR 12 percent) have been reported in
Bouza, Tahoua region with 3 districts affected between 13 Jul and 24 Aug
[2005]. Control measures are being put in place, although the risk of
waterborne diseases has been exacerbated by the current humanitarian situation.
Senegal: 19 863 case and 231 deaths (CFR 1.1 percent) have occurred during
the outbreak which began in January [2005] and peaked at the end of March
[2005]. Since mid- June [2005], an average of 400-500 new cases per week
have been reported, with 3541 cases reported during the last 2 months.

[10] Shigellosis, 2003-2004 - USA (IL)
Date: Fri 26 Aug 2005
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

During 2003-2004, the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH)
investigated an increase in reported _Shigella flexneri_ serotype 3
infections among adult males. This report summarizes the investigation into
those cases and underscores the potential for sexual transmission of
enteric infections among men who have sex with men (MSM).
Shigellosis is a reportable disease in Illinois. During 1995-2002, a total
of 95 cases of _S. flexneri_ serotype 3 infection in Chicago residents were
reported to CDPH (mean: 11.9 cases per year); 40 (42 percent) of these
cases occurred in males aged >18 years (Figure 1, for figures see above
URL). In contrast, 33 (85 percent) of 39 reported cases (mean: 19.5 cases
per year) occurred in adult males during 2003-2004. The mean annual number
of case reports among adult males increased from 5.0 to 16.5, whereas case
reports among women and children decreased from 6.9 to 3.0 during this
period. CDPH conducted an investigation to characterize these infections.
For this investigation, a case of _S. flexneri_ serotype 3 infection was
defined as one with onset of diarrhea during 2003-2004 in a male Chicago
resident aged >18 years, with accompanying isolation of _S. flexneri_
serotype 3 from stool culture. Health-care providers were asked to report
all Shigella infections among Chicago residents to CDPH and to send
Shigella isolates to the state public health laboratory for speciation.
Persons whose illness was consistent with the case definition were
interviewed with a standard case-investigation questionnaire, which
included the following questions: "With regard to sexual orientation, would
you describe yourself as 1) heterosexual, 2) homosexual, 3) bisexual, 4)
don't know, or 5) refused?" and "In the week prior to the onset of this
illness, do you remember engaging in a same-sex relationship?" Responses
were "yes," "no," or "don't know." Information about sexual activities and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status was not collected systematically.
Serotyping, antimicrobial-susceptibility testing, and pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) of available isolates were performed at the Illinois
Department of Public Health and CDC.
Illness onsets for 33 identified patients occurred throughout both years
(Figure 2). In all patients, clinical illness was limited to
gastroenteritis; 16 (48 percent) patients were hospitalized for treatment,
and all recovered without sequelae. Patients ranged in age from 20 to 56
years (median: 35 years); 24 (83 percent) of 29 patients for whom race was
ascertained were non-Hispanic white. 22 (88 percent) of 25 patients asked
to characterize their sexual orientation described themselves as MSM. No
other common food, water, daycare, or travel exposures or risk factors for
shigellosis were found. 14 isolates obtained from MSM were available for
additional testing. 12 (86 percent) were identified as _S. flexneri_
subtype 3a; the remaining 2 isolates were _S. flexneri_ subtype 3b. 7
closely related PFGE patterns were identified among the 11 _S. flexneri_
subtype 3a isolates subtyped by PFGE. 11 isolates were tested for
antimicrobial susceptibility; all were susceptible to ciprofloxacin and
resistant to ampicillin, and 9 (82 percent) were resistant to
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Shigella is the 3rd most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the
United States (1). The majority of Shigella infections in the USA are
caused by _S. sonnei_ and affect young children and their caretakers. _S.
flexneri_ causes approximately 18 percent of USA Shigella infections (1).
The national incidence of _S. flexneri_ infections decreased 64 percent
from 1989 to 2002 (1). However, a recent analysis indicated an increase in
Shigella infection among adult males (2). This increase is likely
attributable to outbreaks of shigellosis among MSM. Since the 1970s,
outbreaks of shigellosis attributable to _S. flexneri_, and more recently
_S. sonnei_, have been reported among MSM in major cities in North America
(3-5), Europe (6), and Australia (7).
The low inoculum required for Shigella infection (as few as 10-200
organisms) facilitates person-to-person transmission. Risk factors for
sexual transmission of Shigella have not been well characterized but likely
involve exposure to fecal material. In outbreaks among MSM, 50-90 percent
of participants reported oral-genital or oral-anal contact during the week
before diagnosis with Shigella infection (3,5). A case-control study of
shigellosis among MSM in Sydney, Australia, implicated exposure to a
commercial sex venue as the sole risk factor for illness (7). Although the
effect of HIV infection on risk for sexual transmission of Shigella is not
well understood, it might be associated with elevated risk for acquiring
shigellosis and with more severe disease (8).
Other enteric illnesses, such as those caused by hepatitis A, _Entamoeba
histolytica_, _Giardia lamblia_, Campylobacter, and Salmonella, also can be
transmitted sexually (4,9,10). Because feces can contain multiple
pathogens, polymicrobial infections can result from a single sexual
exposure (3,4). Outbreaks of sexually transmitted shigellosis might be
observed more frequently than outbreaks of other sexually transmissible
enteric organisms because the infectious dose is lower, the illness
produces symptoms that are more likely to bring patients to medical
attention, and laboratory diagnosis is simpler. More routine molecular
subtyping of Shigella by PFGE might also facilitate recognition of
epidemiologically-related shigellosis clusters.
To reduce the risk for sexually transmitted enteric infections, persons
with diarrhea should refrain from oral-anal, oral-genital, and anal-genital
contact while they are symptomatic. Because Shigella and other enteric
pathogens can be carried asymptomatically, persons who engage in sexual
contact that could expose them or their sex partners to fecal material
should wash their hands and anal-genital regions thoroughly with soap and
water before and after sexual activity. The use of condoms during
oral-genital or anal-genital contact, dental dams during oral-anal contact,
and gloves during digital-anal contact will help reduce the opportunities
for sexual transmission of Shigella and other pathogens. Clinicians should
request appropriate laboratory examinations, including stool culture for
patients with diarrhea who are MSM, and counsel patients about the risk for
infection with enteric pathogens during sexual activity that could expose
them to feces. Shigella isolates should be routinely serotyped and
molecularly subtyped by PFGE to assist in detection of outbreaks.
Investigations of shigellosis outbreaks and outbreaks of other enteric
diseases among MSM are needed to better characterize specific high-risk
behaviors for transmission, identify effective prevention measures, and
clarify the role of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy in the sexual
transmission of Shigella.
