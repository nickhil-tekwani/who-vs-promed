The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region is hoping to give the neo-natal
intensive care unit (NICU) at the Regina General Hospital a clean
bill of health following an outbreak of _Clostridium difficile_ by
Friday [Oct 16, 2008].

"A total of 9 babies tested positive for [_C. difficile_]. The 1st
case was identified on 2 Oct [2008]. Of those 9 babies, 5 have
completed their treatment and their symptoms have cleared,'' Jim
Slater, executive director of diagnostic services told reporters at a
news conference Wednesday [14 Oct 2008] at the hospital. The other 4
babies are in their final days of treatment and have been
symptom-free for over 48 hours, Slater said. "Initially 2 other
babies had symptoms of diarrhea but tested negative for _C.
difficile_ and last week [week of 6 Oct 2008] we had another baby
with symptoms of diarrhea but also tested negative for _C.
difficile_,'' he said.

All the cases are now symptom-free. While the hospital continues to
follow its infection control precautions, Slater said as of Wednesday
[14 Oct 2008] a large portion of the NICU will be reopened and the
babies taken out of isolation. "The outbreak is actually over but we
are going to continue those precautions for a couple more days,''
Slater said, explaining the unit has undergone a thorough cleaning.
The infected babies were isolated, but the NICU unit was not actually
closed to new admissions during the outbreak because newborns in the
NICU require very specialized care, he said.

This strain of _C. difficile_ is easily treated, he added, noting
none of the babies have been seriously ill or died from this
bacterial infection. This outbreak is not the same strain of the
bacterial infection identified as a factor in hundreds of deaths in
immune-compromised patients in Ontario hospitals over the past 2
years. The particular strain of _C. difficile_ in the Ontario
outbreak did not respond well to antibiotics, Slater told reporters.

"_C. difficile_ is quite common. It is not something that is rare and
unusual. One recent review cited anywhere from 15 to 63 percent of
newborns will actually be colonized with _C. difficile_ but they may
be asymptomatic. So _C. difficile_ is not that uncommon so it is very
difficult to actually find out where it came from.''

_C. difficile_, one of the most common infections found in hospitals
and long-term care facilities, causes diarrhea, fever, loss of
appetite, nausea, and cramps. The bacteria which cause the infection
is found in feces and can be spread if people touch items or surfaces
that are contaminated with [the bacterium or its] spores from fecal
matter and then touch their mouths or noses. It can also be spread
through hand contact as a result of improper handwashing.

Slater said the health region did not disclose the outbreak to the
general public initially because the NICU is not open to the public.
Visits to the unit are restricted to immediate family, who were
oriented to proper handwashing protocol and infection control procedures.

[_Clostridium difficile_ is an obligate anaerobic, gram-positive,
spore-forming bacillus which produces 2 toxins, A and B. Toxin A
causes fluid secretion and mucosal damage while toxin B has
cytopathic effects in tissue culture; both toxins are thought to play
a role in the pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated diarrhea,
pseudo-membranous colitis.

The epidemiology of _C. difficile_ infection in neonates and infants
is very different from that in older children and adults. Neonates
are more likely to carry toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains of _C.
difficile_ asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract after
even short stays in the hospital after birth, although longer
hospital stays are associated with higher rates of colonization. Up
to 70 percent of asymptomatic neonates are carriers of _C. difficile_
in the GI tract. The rate of colonization and the proportion of
colonized asymptomatic infants with detectable toxin decline within
the 1st years of life to adult levels in the community of less than 5 percent.

Although neonates are more frequent carriers of _C. difficile_, they
do not often develop pseudomembranous colitis. It has been proposed
that immature neonatal colonic flora permits _C. difficile_
colonization, and the infrequency of symptomatic disease despite high
colonization rates with toxigenic strains is thought to relate to the
immaturity of the toxin receptor sites on the intestinal mucosa,
which are not able to bind the toxins. Neutralizing effect of
maternal antibodies and immaturity of the neonatal immune system may
play additional roles. The source of _C. difficile_ in neonates is
believed to be either the mother's colon flora or the health care
environment (Kato H, et al: Application of Typing by Pulsed-Field Gel
Electrophoresis to the Study of _Clostridium difficile_ in a Neonatal
Intensive Care Unit. J Clin Microbiol. 1994; 32: 2067-70; available
at <http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/32/9/2067>). Day-care acquisition
of _C. difficile_ has been described in older children.

One wonders how the causal relationship of _C. difficile_ was
established in the etiology of gastrointestinal conditions in
neonates at Regina General Hospital, when viewed in the context of
the usual high colonization rate of this organism in asymptomatic
neonates. What was the isolation rate of _C. difficile_ in
asymptomatic neonates and the proportion of asymptomatic neonates
with detectable toxin in comparison to these rates in the symptomatic
neonates at Regina General Hospital? Were other causes of diarrheal
disease in neonates ruled out?

The illness in the neonates was said to be mild and the strain of _C.
difficile_ isolated from neonates in this outbreak was not ribotype
027, which is associated with more severe disease.

Regina is the capital of Saskatchewan, Canada. The city is the 2nd
largest with a population of 179 246 in the province (after
Saskatoon) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regina,_Saskatchewan>). It
