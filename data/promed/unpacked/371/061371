From what I read, the North America or Virginia opossum (_Didelphis
virginiana_) is native in the East, but was introduced to the West of the
Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains.
You can find details in JA Chapman & GA Feldhamer (ed) 1982 - Wild mammals
of North America. The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore and London.
A new edition has very recently been published.

Regarding consideration of Virginia opossums in California as a native
species, we do not consider wild pigs, purple loosestrife, European
starlings, or rock doves natives, and they have been here a long time.
Bullfrogs are native to Eastern North America, but not Western, hence are
consider non-native (and invasive) in California, where they have
significant deleterious effects on some native frogs and toads. They were
introduced for the benefit of the restaurant industry after the native
red-legged frog was seriously depleted. The opossum apparently was
introduced to the San Jose area in 1895 as a game animal, and has spread
from there.
Length of time is not the only consideration in determining whether an
animal should be considered native. The big question is how it got where it
is now. In North America, if an organism's range has been expanded through
direct human intervention since Europeans colonized the continent, the
organism is considered non-native in the expanded range area. There are
significant issues associated with many of the introductions, including
alteration and loss of habitat for native species and introduction of
pathogens.

The opossum is also considered to be a pest by some in Southern
California. As far as numbers are concerned, they represent the 3rd most
frequently impounded animal species (behind dogs and cats) by our
agency. In fact if memory serves, about 3500 opossums were picked up in
2003, from a total of over 32 000 impounds.
