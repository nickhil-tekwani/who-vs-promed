El Dorado County [California] Public Health is reminding residents and visitors to use precautions to prevent tickborne relapsing fever after receiving reports of 2 cases of the illness in the past 2 months. "Both cases of tickborne relapsing fever were reported in individuals who had stayed in cabins in the greater Tahoe area," said Heather Orchard, supervising public health nurse with county Public Health. "The individuals who became ill have since received treatment and recovered. The illness can be prevented by keeping rodents out of dwellings, not sleeping in any building where there is obvious rodent infestation, and taking a few other basic precautions."

Tickborne relapsing fever is a bacterial infection that can cause recurring bouts of fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and nausea. The bacteria are carried by soft ticks that feed on rodents such as squirrels, chipmunks, and mice. The ticks usually live in the nests of the rodents.

Rodents may sometimes build nests in the walls, attics, or other void spaces of cabins, houses, or other buildings. The ticks that carry the fever may leave those nests if the rodents have left or have been removed, and may seek out other mammals upon which to feed, including humans. The bite of a soft tick is painless and they attach to feed for only a few minutes. Soft ticks often feed at night; so many people are bitten while asleep and never realize it.

People can get tickborne relapsing fever when they are bitten by an infected soft tick. Most people are infected while visiting rural mountain areas, typically between 3000 and 9000 feet [914-2743 m] during the summer months. The infection is not transmitted from person to person.

According to Orchard, persons with tickborne relapsing fever may develop a sudden high fever (104-105 F [40-40.5 C]), chills, headache, and muscle ache about a week after being bitten by an infected tick. They may also have nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and a rash. These symptoms last 3-5 days and then quickly disappear. A few days later, the fever and other symptoms occur again. This cycle may continue for several weeks if not treated. "If you develop these symptoms, you should see your doctor right away. Tickborne relapsing fever is treated with antibiotics," said Orchard.

Tickborne relapsing fever is endemic in many areas of California, particularly mountainous areas, and is typically associated with rustic cabins.

The following precautions are advised to prevent tick-borne relapsing fever:
- keep rodents out of dwellings;
- remove rodent nesting materials such as newspapers, woodpiles, and other accumulated debris from in and around the home;
- store all food in well-sealed containers.

In addition to the above precautions, if staying in a mountain cabin, condominium, or other dwelling:
- inspect the inside and outside of the building for evidence of rodents (holes or gnaw marks in the walls, droppings, and/or nests);
- avoid sleeping on the floor or on a bed that touches a wall;
- change and wash all bedding before use.

[Relapsing fever (RF) is a bacterial infection caused by certain species of the spirochete _Borrelia_. These organisms are able to periodically change their surface protein molecules to evade the host's immune response, thus causing a relapsing illness. Following an incubation period of about 7 days, the illness is characterized by recurring episodes of high fever, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting, each episode lasting several days, followed by a several-day asymptomatic interval. There may be up to 3-4 recurrences. Complications may include involvement of the lungs (ARDS; acute respiratory distress syndrome), central nervous system, eyes, heart, and liver. The bacteremia is intense (more than 10 000 organisms per ml of blood) during febrile episodes, which allows detection of organisms on a Wright-Giemsa stained blood smear. Thick blood smears are more sensitive than thin smears. The typical peripheral blood smear can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/relapsing-fever/images/tbrf-smear.jpg.

There are 3 types of RF: As Dr Alan Barbour has pointed out in a prior ProMED-mail post (Hard tick-borne relapsing fever - USA (02): (MA) comment, correction 20150725.3535934), almost all _Borrelia_ species causing RF are transmitted by ticks, except for _B. recurrentis_, which is transmitted by the human louse. All the other known _Borrelia_ species are transmitted by either hard (ixodid) ticks, like _Ixodes scapularis_, or soft (argasid) ticks, usually species of the genus _Ornithodoros_. Hard tick RF is caused by _B. miyamotoi_. Soft tick RF in the United States can be caused by several species, including _B. hermsii_, _B. turicatae_, and _B. parkeri_; their distribution follows the geographic distribution of the tick vector. RF due to _B. hermsii_ occurs in the north western US at higher altitudes (1500 to 8000 feet)/457 to 2438 m; _B. turicatae_ occurs in Texas and Florida; and _B. parkeri_ in the north western US at lower altitudes.

Louseborne (LB) RF is caused by a single species, _B. recurrentis_, transmitted through abraded skin when the body louse is crushed during scratching. Louseborne RF is endemic in Ethiopia, Sudan, Eritrea, and Somalia. Outbreaks are found in developing regions affected by war and in refugee camps characterized by overcrowding and poor personal hygiene. Humans are the only host of _B. recurrentis_. While mammals and reptiles may serve as a reservoir for tick-borne _Borrelia_ species.

Treatment of RF consists of either a tetracycline (such as doxycycline), a macrolide (such as erythromycin), penicillin, or other beta-lactam antibiotics (such as ceftriaxone). Louseborne RF can be treated effectively with a single dose of the antibiotic (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/137/5/573), whereas treatment of tickborne RF requires 7-10 days to prevent relapse. When initiating antibiotic therapy, all patients should be observed for a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The reaction, caused by a massive release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and other cytokines, is manifest by a worsening of symptoms with rigors, tachycardia, sweating, hypotension, and high fever, occurs in over 50 per cent of cases.

El Dorado County, with a population of 181 058 in 2010, is located entirely in the Sierra Nevada in the US state of California and borders on the east Lake Tahoe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Dorado_County,_California). Lake Tahoe is a large alpine freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada, lying at an elevation of 6225 ft (1897 m), between California and Nevada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Tahoe).
