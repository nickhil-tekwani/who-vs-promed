Hemorrhagic diathesis in neonatal calves is a new and emerging disease
of young calves. The disease affects calves aged less than 4 weeks.
Clinical signs in calves include skin and intestinal bleeding as well
as petechiae on all mucosal membranes. The cause of this syndrome is
as of yet unknown. In this study, to the best of our knowledge, the
authors demonstrated the 1st case [in Poland] of hemorrhagic diathesis
in neonatal calves with hematological and histopathological diagnosis.
Clinical examinations demonstrated cutaneous bleeding. Hematological
examination showed thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. During necropsy
multiple generalized petechiae, ecchymoses or hemorrhages were
ascertained. Histopathology revealed a multifocal extravasation of red
blood cells (hemorrhage). Severe loss of hematopoietic tissue of the
bone marrow was the most prominent finding on histology. The BVD
antigen test was negative.

[Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP, popularly named "bleeding calf
disease," also neonatal haemorrhagic diathesis), was initially noticed
in early 2007 as a disease of unclear aetiology affecting calves under
4 weeks of age, characterised by thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and
multiple unexplained haemorrhages. Cases were reported in several
European countries, including Germany, France, Belgium, Great Britain
(England, Wales and Scotland), Netherlands, Italy and Ireland. Poland
has now been added.

We are informed that BNP has been identified also in New Zealand: the
1st country to be reported as affected outside Europe.

In early June 2010, Pfizer Animal Health (PAH) decided to voluntarily
stop further sales of PregSure BVD (inactivated, adjuvanted) vaccine,
pending further investigations into the BNP syndrome in calves. This
was done in view of accumulating circumstantial evidence on the
possible connection between the 2, though at that time, a causal
relationship between them was not established (see archived post 20100607.1896. For a detailed paper addressing the final establishment
of the vaccinal etiology, please refer to 20110601.1671. - Mod.AS]
