Cattle owners in East Darfur have made complaints about the emergence of a smallpox-like virus among their cattle. The state's veterinary departments have not yet been able to verify the complaints.

A number of cattle owners complained about what they called smallpox infections among livestock, sheep in particular, and pointed to the lack of medicine in the veterinary pharmacies in the state.

However, the East Darfur minister of animal resources, El Fadil Khalfiya, has denied the outbreak of such a disease among livestock.

On Mon 26 Nov 2018] he told Radio Dabanga that his ministry had not received any reports so far from the directors of veterinary departments or vets in the 9 localities of the state.

"There is a talk about the disease on social media, but there are no [official] reports so far," according to Khalfiya.

[A "smallpox-like" virus in cattle is most likely to be lumpy skin disease (LSD), caused by a capripoxvirus.

A "smallpox-like" virus in sheep is most likely to be sheep pox (SP), similarly caused by a capripoxvirus. The LSD and SP capripoxviruses are closely related, but clinical cross infection is not known to occur.

Both diseases are endemic in Sudan. According to Sudan's last annual report to the OIE, during 2017 10 new LSD outbreaks and 9 new SP outbreaks were recorded and (annual) mass vaccinations against both were applied.

Until further science-based diagnosis, from Sudan's official sources or from other professional sources, such as international agencies or non-governmental organizations becomes available, this event remains "undiagnosed". - Mod.AS
