The following background data on meningococcal meningitis in Australia were
extracted from the GIDEON software program:
- Bacterial meningitis was the eighth-ranked cause for infectious disease
mortality during 1979 to 1981, and the tenth-ranked during 1992 to 1994.
- Highest attack rates are recorded among children below age 5 years,
particularly in Aboriginal communities in central and northern Australia.
- The peak reporting year for 'meningitis' was 1942 (2,371 cases - group A
meningococcus predominant).
- Rates for meningococcal disease rise in June and peak in October.

- An epidemic of type A meningococcal disease during 1971 to 1973 affected
primarily Aboriginal communities. An additional outbreak of type A disease
was registered during 1987 to 1991 in central Australia. In other years,
type B has predominated.

- In 1994 type C meningococci predominated in New South Wales and North
Queensland and type B in Queensland. In 1996, type B accounted for 63% of
strains and type C for 29% However, types B and C each accounted for 44% of
isolates in the Northern Territory.
