Eight elephants have perished so far in the wake of the emergence of a strange disease that seems to affect only jumbos in the northern tourist circuit. Scientists at the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute (TAWIRI), based in Arusha, have taken up the case, saying the unidentified disease, as well as the death of large mammals, is the 1st to be experienced in Tanzania.

Wildlife officers are just as baffled. Mr Joseph Meng'oro, the deputy wildlife officer at the Ngorongoro District Council, where most of the deaths have been recorded, is worried that more deaths could be occurring without notice.

"The jumbos started to haemorrhage through their trunks and then collapsed and eventually died in Arash Ward, from the 20th of September this year [2018]. Later we traced 7 carcasses in different parts of Loliondo division," he said.

The 8th elephant was discovered near Manyara Ranch in Makuyuni Ward in Monduli district. Mr Fidelis ole Kashe, an officer with the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF), said the jumbo was spotted by villagers and was meandering in the area before it collapsed and died.

Samples of blood from the carcasses found in Loliondo were taken to the Tanzania Veterinary Laboratory Agency (TVLA) centre of Arusha, where chemists who conducted an analysis said no disease was detected.

The TVLA test report number, ARTR 2018/949, as approved by Mr Paul Sanka at the laboratory, indicated that the "microscopical examinations" samples using polychrome methylene blue stain were "negative of anthrax"; it seems many had suspected cases of anthrax.

According to, Meng'oro, they also checked the carcasses for any wound to indicate possible cases of poaching, but there was none.

However, the elephant that was found at Makuyuni had a spear wound on the back, but it was suspected that possibly some people used the weapon at the jumbo in self-defence after it meandered near their homesteads.

Some observers, however, propose that more tests should be conducted on the elephant remains, as it was possible that poachers could have resorted to using stealth poisonous chemicals to hunt down the jumbos for their ivories.

However, all 8 dead jumbos had their tusks intact. The chief conservator at Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Dr Freddy Manongi, said the incidences of jumbo death have not yet been experienced in the NCA.

Contacted by phone, the public relations manager for the Tanzania Wildlife Management Authority (TAWA), Twaha Twaibu, speaking from Morogoro, said his authority was following up the incidence with TAWIRI and may release a statement later.

[Anthrax outbreaks and single cases in wild elephants have been reported many times. However, microscopic exam of smears failed to find _Bacilus anthracis_. The causes underlying these deaths could be several, and there is need of thorough postmortem examination and other steps of an outbreak investigation to be able to speculate possible reasons. Information about this episode and the tests being carried out would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.PMB
