Residents in the Tajik capital confront typhoid outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------
When the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
recently announced a typhoid outbreak in Tajikistan, it was telling the
world what residents of the Tajik capital already knew. At least 500 people
have contracted typhoid in Dushanbe, according to media reports, with 3
reported fatalities. "Typhoid is raging in the capital of Tajikistan," said
a commentary published by the Asia-Plus news agency.
On 25 Jul 2003, the Russian newspaper Meditsinskaya Gazeta cited reliable
sources in reporting that a typhoid epidemic was raging in Tajikistan. The
article contained an implicit warning to Russians about the typhoid threat.
Following publication of the article, the Ministry of Health revealed that
1700 medical personnel were working to protect the population of Dushanbe
from the disease. Health officials also said the outbreak likely began in
the Bokhtar district 2 months ago, with contaminated water the suspected cause.
The last major outbreak of typhoid in Tajikistan -- which occurred in 1997
-- was blamed on a lack of clean drinking water. The outbreak sickened 8901
people and killed 95 over a 6-month period, according to the Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report [see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00054823.htm> for details of this
report - Mod.MPP]. Conditions have changed little since then. Most of the
city districts are short of water; and tap water often contains plenty of
sediment.

[As pointed out in prior ProMED-mail postings, the diagnosis of typhoid
fever is often made clinically; many other diseases including typhus,
typhoid's namesake, may be erroneously diagnosed as typhoid. - Mod.LL]
