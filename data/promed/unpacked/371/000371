A Viet Nam-produced pork liver paste has been ordered to be taken off shelves in Taiwan and banned from import over African swine fever (ASF) contamination fears.

The product was found to have been infected with the ASF virus on 9 Dec 2019, as part of a spot check targeting canned meat, processed foods, condiments, as well as sauce and broth-based products manufactured in risk areas, according to Council of Agriculture (COA) minister Chen Chi-chung.

Asian countries that have reported outbreaks of the pig epidemic include China, Mongolia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, the Philippines, North Korea, South Korea, East Timor, and Indonesia. Fresh ASF cases were reported in Indonesia on 17 Dec 2019, indicating the threat of the [ASF] has not yet diminished, said the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.

Border checks identified 212 contaminated samples between 1 Oct and 24 Dec 2019. Among the cases, 164 were from China and 48 from Viet Nam. Taiwan has imposed restrictions on the import of related pork products from Viet Nam.

An amendment to the Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Disease, proclaimed on 13 Dec 2019, stipulates that e-commerce businesses will be subject to a fine between NTD 30 000 (USD 996) and NTD 150 000 (USD 4981) for selling meat products in violation of animal quarantine measures.

[The fact that ASF is not pathogenic to humans should not lead to neglecting the prescribed elementary requirements to prevent its wide-scale and rapid dissemination. Introducing ASF-infected pork and its products into hitherto unaffected countries, and the uncontrolled movement of such products within infected countries, leads to further spread of this devastating pig disease, against which no vaccine is available to date. - Mod.AS
