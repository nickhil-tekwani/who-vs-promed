[The Lahij governorate is denoted by the number 15 on Yemen's administrative map (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen).

"Rabies is endemic in Yemen with a very high rabies-positive rate for animals involved in attacks, particularly for stray male dogs. Male children were most often involved in attacks by rabies-positive animals. The presence of food waste (particularly poultry carcasses) and school vacation periods were found to correlate significantly with increased risk for human exposure to rabies".

[2] Jordan (Madaba Governorate): dog-acquired human case

Medical interventions at Al-Nadim Governmental Hospital in Madaba did not save the life of a 7-year-old child after he was attacked by stray dogs in the Manja area, leaving a state of fear and anxiety over stray dogs prevalent in all regions of the governorate.

The child arrived at Al-Nadim Governmental Hospital 2 days ago [30 Mar 2022], according to a medical source, and was put on a ventilator in the intensive care unit, after being bitten by a dog in the neck and face area with lacerations in the blood vessels, and was in a poor condition and brain dead. He died within 3 hours.

It is noteworthy that stray dogs are spreading in the city of Madaba and its areas and between residential neighborhoods and their gardens, and they have become a threat to the lives of citizens, especially children.

MP Nassar Al-Haysah deplored the absence of practical solutions to the problem of the spread of stray dogs among residential neighborhoods, stressing the need to develop practical and radical solutions and protect citizens. Dogs are running around in the morning hours during the period when students leave their schools and in the evening hours, so it is unreasonable for the concerned government agencies to remain idle without finding a solution for them.

He stressed the importance of concerted efforts at the national level and government intervention to solve this issue, which threatens the lives of our children and terrorizes them, according to the regulations and laws as well as finding shelters for them per the international experiences in this field.

The Director of Madaba Health, Dr. Khalil Al-Rawahna, indicated that since the beginning of this year [2022], 305 dog bite cases have been recorded, all of which received medical care, noting that the cost of treatment and medicines amounts to 700 dinars [USD 846.27] per case, over a period of 3 months.

For his part, the mayor of Greater Madaba, Aref Al-Rawajeeh, stated that the phenomenon of stray dogs is a worrying matter, and the municipality is keen to reduce it, away from solutions like killing, especially since the law prohibits killing them by shooting or poisoning.

He added that the municipality is looking for a source of funding to establish a special center for dog care in line with animal welfare instructions, hoping that the municipality will succeed in its endeavor in this regard in cooperation with government agencies and funding agencies concerned with animal welfare.

["The main sources of rabies in Jordan are stray dogs and jackals. Jordan and Israel launched a joint effort to manage rabies in strays by using baits with the oral vaccination, distributing them by airplane at the border. This demonstrates how implementing control measures for zoonotic diseases can be an area for international cooperation". (McAlester J, Kanazawa Y (2022). Situating zoonotic diseases in peacebuilding and development theories: Prioritizing zoonoses in Jordan. PLoS ONE 17(3): e0265508; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265508). - Mod.AS

[3] India (Madhya Pradesh): dog, buffalo, public response

It was a routine day at Dabra health centre, some 45 km [28 mi] from Gwalior, on Thursday [24 Mar 2022] until people came in ones and twos and then scores, clamouring for rabies vaccines. As the crowd swelled to over 500 and vaccine vials dwindled, health staff scrambled to find out what had triggered the rush. What they learnt left them bemused.

"The buffalo died," was what they could hear over the din. "Its calf, too," said some. The medics eventually pieced together the sequence of events. A buffalo and its calf had died after being bitten by a rabid stray. Hundreds of people realized that the raita they had consumed at a religious ceremony the previous day was made from curd from the same buffalo's milk. Its milk had also been delivered to several houses that day.

"Nobody was concerned until they came to know from a farmer that the dog was rabid. This spread like a wildfire and people started running to the hospital," said a local resident.

"They panicked, thinking they would contract rabies from the milk and curd."

Medical officer of Dabra civil hospital, Dr Vijay Pathak, told TOI that around 1000 people wanted to take anti-rabies injections.

"Local leader Imarti Devi also called to inquire about this case and our arrangements. I told her that we have got WHO guidelines and rabies shots are not necessary in this case. Only some of them took the jabs," he said. Officers from the Gwalior Medical College and Infectious Disease Centre had to rush to Dabra to control the panic. The PHC ran out of anti-rabies stocks.

"Some people took the vaccine at the government hospital while others approached private facilities," said a local resident. Dabra block medical officer Dr Arvind Sharma said WHO had issued guidelines in 2018 that consumption of milk or even milk products from rabid animals doesn't transmit the disease.

Around 150 villagers were not convinced and were given anti-rabies shots, he said.

[India, unfortunately, remains at the top of the list of rabies-affected countries, though the actual statistics are debatable. The described incidence reflects the need for a continuous extension and public education concerning rabies, and zoonoses at large. - Mod.AS

The Ministry of Health updates that today [28 Mar 2022] a message was received about a cat infected with rabies in Moshav Safsufa in the upper Galilee. The family members who were exposed to him began to receive preventative treatment.

The Ministry of Health asks anyone who has been in contact or whose animals came into contact in the area of the incident with the infected animal or any stray animal, between 8 Mar 2022 and 22 Mar 2022, to urgently contact the health bureau nearest to their place of residence, to consider the need for preventive treatment.

Members of the public who come into contact with stray animals are also asked to arrive after work and during the weekend to the emergency room at the hospital. Parents of children are asked to find out from their children if they have been in contact with suspicious animals and to contact the Health Bureau urgently. Pet owners are asked to contact the official veterinarian to verify their vaccination status.

The Ministry of Health again reminds those who have been bitten or scratched by an animal, to immediately rinse the area with running water and soap, disinfect with disinfectants and approach the Health Bureau to check if preventive treatment against rabies is needed.

[The rabid cat is the 10th case in Israel since the start of 2022. A dynamic map of rabies in Israel, 2022, is available at https://bit.ly/3J5HVKn. Click the "legend" (red = cattle, pink = dog, aqua = jackal, yellow = cat). All cases have been recorded along the Lebanese border. On the said map, one can visit also Jordan's rabies-affected governorate, Madaba (identifiable when zooming in to the northeast of the Dead Sea, where "M.Nebo" can be seen).

Israel has been applying, for more than 2 decades, countrywide oral vaccination of wildlife (foxes and jackals). During this period, the number of cases in foxes has dramatically decreased; the impact on jackals was significant as well. In 2017-2018, rabies spread from northwestern Jordan into Israel's northeastern valleys, infecting primarily jackals, which, for reasons yet to be established, were not sufficiently protected, spreading the disease westwards as far as the Mediterranean coast. Intensified oral vaccination efforts contributed to the termination of the event (ProMED archive 20200606.7433999).

Israel's last human case dates back to May 2003; the victim was bitten by a rabid cat in the southern district. - Mod.AS
