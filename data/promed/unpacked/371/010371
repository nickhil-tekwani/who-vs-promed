With the continuing wet, warm, and humid conditions, specialist
agronomist John McCulloch of County Crops considers this year [2008]
to be a particularly high-pressure year for a number of diseases.
Advising growers in the North West, he says that he has seen more
sclerotinia this year than ever before. "I have seen a lot of it in
the usual crops such as lettuce, celery, carrots, and oilseed rape
[see recent ProMED-mail posts below] and also in some more unusual
crops such as calabrese [broccoli variety]. These high levels can be
put down to this year's terrible weather and high rainfall, which
have encouraged sclerotinia as well as other wet weather diseases
including ring spot (_Mycosphaerella brassicola_), white blister
(_Albugo candida_) and _Botrytis_," says John.

John advises growers to adopt an appropriate fungicide programme, but
with fungicide resistance and crop safety being top of mind. "This
means starting fungicides early. They can be mixed as part of a
resistance strategy and then followed by other fungicides with
different modes of action. Use fungicides only when necessary. It is
so important to minimise any resistance pressure on any one-fungicide
group. We already have resistance to metalaxyl in _Botrytis_,"
advises John. He points out that there are fewer and fewer effective
products from which to choose. "If the EU decides to limit this any
further, we could be in a very difficult situation. It is vital that
we retain the armoury of products that we have."

[The disease referred to is the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. It
is one of the most nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens with
around 400 known hosts and is present worldwide.

Symptoms vary on different hosts, for example: On celery the disease
is called pink rot because the rotted, watery area that develops on
mature celery is usually pinkish in color; the fungus attacks the
basal crown and petioles; plants appear to suddenly wilt and collapse
in the field. On lettuce, the disease is called lettuce drop; outer
leaves are infected first, then the fungus moves inward; leaves wilt
and fall from the head in succession; the heart may remain erect, but
becomes a wet, slimy mass. On beans, pods can become infected, while
on the plant and post harvest. On carrot, it causes severe root rot
and also affects the leaves. For disease description on oilseed rape
see previous reports. On some crops, the related species _S. minor_
can cause similar symptoms.

The pathogen is primarily soil-borne and has a complex disease cycle.
It can survive in soil as sclerotia and is also spread by infected
plant material, mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. Risk of crop
infection depends on the previous disease history of an area as well
as weather conditions. Disease management includes cultural practices
and fungicide applications.

The report above makes an important point on guarding against
build-up of fungicide resistances in pathogens of crops. New fungal
strains evolve frequently adapting to environmental pressure. Modern
crop monocultures provide ideal conditions for pathogens and
therefore for the emergence of new strains with increased virulence
and increased resistance traits.
