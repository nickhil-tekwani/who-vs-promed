Colleton County residents advised to stay away from wild animals;
vaccinate pets against rabies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A raccoon found in the Neck Area of Edisto Beach is Colleton County's
1st rabid animal of 2010, the SC Department of Health and
Environmental Control [DHEC] reported today [16 Dec 2010]. "2 dogs
killed the raccoon," said Tony Stephens supervisor of DHEC's Colleton
County Environmental Health Office. "Since both dogs are currently
vaccinated against rabies, they will be quarantined for 45 days."

Stephens said once the rabies virus reaches the brain, the disease is
fatal to humans and animals. According to Stephens, anyone bitten,
scratched, or otherwise exposed to the saliva of a rabid animal must
undergo immediate measures to stop the virus from reaching the brain.

"Avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild,"
Stephens said. "About 400 South Carolinians must undergo preventive
treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures from being
bitten or scratched by a rabid or suspected rabid animal. Wild
animals carry the disease most often, but domestic pets can contract
rabies as well.

"Therefore, to protect both the pets and their owners, residents
should make sure their pets are regularly vaccinated against the
disease. State law requires that all pets be vaccinated against rabies.

"If you think you have been exposed to the rabies virus through a
bite, scratch, or the saliva of a possibly infected animal,
immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water," he
said. "Then be sure to get medical attention and report the incident to DHEC."

Last year [2009], no rabid animals were confirmed in the county,
[but] there were 152 confirmed cases of rabies in animals in South
Carolina. So far this year [2010], there have been 103 confirmed
cases in animals in the state.

[A number of articles have been almost horror stories of people not
knowing what to do when confronted by a potential rabid animal. With
almost 400 people receiving preventative vaccines, the state of South
Carolina surely has a public outreach to assist people in getting
appropriate information about testing animals and protecting
themselves. But a key is to vaccinate our domestic pets and be wary
of situations that are out of the normal behavior for any animal. - Mod.TG]

[2] Rabies biologics - Michigan
Date: Sun 19 Dec 2010

<http://naturalunseenhazards.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/rabies-reports-from-michigan-and-virginia-and-an-inquiry-regarding-garccdc-global-availability-of-rabies-biologics-survey/>


Rabies remains a problem in the state, with 70 animals testing
positive in Michigan so far this year [2010]. Most cases of animal
rabies are reported in the Lower Peninsula, especially in the
southeast. Counties where humans and pets were exposed to the disease
but showed no risk and received adequate treatment last year [2009]
include Oakland, Kent, Genesee, Shiawassee, and Clinton, according to
the Department of Agriculture.

"The lower half of Michigan has the majority of people, so the
majority of human exposure is associated with the human population,"
said Tom Cooley, a Department of Natural Resources and Environment
[DNRE] biologist. There were 68 positive animal tests last year
[2009], 79 in 2007, and 47 in 2001. In 2009, a Northern Michigan man
died from a bat strain of rabies infection, and no human died from
rabies this year [2010], according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Before 2009, there had been no human deaths from the
disease since 1983. Bats are the most common source of human rabies
infection in the United States. "There is not really a way to control
rabies in bats," Cooley said. Skunks come in second but they account
for only a small percentage of cases. Even fewer instances involve
household pets, he said. Linda Benson, director of the Animal Control
Division in Monroe County, takes the disease seriously and cited a
situation where 2 bats in the county tested positive a couple years
ago. Cooley said DNRE tests for any strain of rabies. "We treat every
bite, scratch, or skin abrasion from an animal as a potential
positive for rabies," Benson said. "But the 2 bats really startled
us. It was really bizarre because we never had any before that."

Inquiry regarding GARC/CDC global availability of rabies biologics survey
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Travelers' Health Branch and Poxvirus and Rabies Branch of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia
and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control (GARC), are concerned
about the health issues facing international travelers and the global
availability of rabies biologics. We know that rabies vaccine (RV)
and/or rabies immune globulin (RIG) are not always available in
certain countries, and that globally, there are many different RVs
and RIG products available for use. Obtaining more accurate
information about the type and availability of RV and RIG is
essential if we are going to effectively provide advice to travelers
with rabies exposures.

To that end and in collaboration with GARC, we have created an online
survey to gather the relevant information about global availability
of rabies biologicals from professional associations, federal
agencies, and the private sector to be launched in February 2011. The
survey is geared towards healthcare practitioners and clinic
directors who are directly seeing patients.

We will be sending this out to rabies prevention networks including
AREB [Asian Rabies Expert Bureau], MEEREB [Middle East and Eastern
Europe Rabies Expert Bureau], AfroREB [Africa Rabies Expert Bureau],
SEARG [South East Africa Rabies Group], Rabies in Asia, and the
Association for Prevention of Rabies in India; however, we are
seeking input on additional relevant rabies networks or clinics that
may be relevant to participate. If you have suggestions for relevant
rabies networks or clinics that may be relevant to participate,
please contact Dr Emily Jentes or Dr Brett Petersen at
<RabiesSurvey@cdc.gov> with the name of the organization and a
primary contact name and email address. We can then follow up with
the relevant networks and clinics directly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

[3] Raccoon, canine exposure - North Carolina

13th rabies case identified in New Hanover County
-------------------------------------------------
A New Hanover County resident has been notified of a possible rabies
exposure after another rabid raccoon was found last week [week of 13
Dec 2010] . Animal Control Services confirmed the resident's dog
fought and killed the raccoon Thursday evening [16 Dec 2010]. The dog
was current on its rabies vaccination.

New Hanover County Animal Control Services authorities have reported
13 case of rabies so far this year [2010]. The latest incident
occurred on Pineknoll Road in the Murrayville area where the resident
handled his pet without protective gloves following the attack.

US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend
animals that are not current on their rabies vaccinations be
destroyed. Pets with up to date vaccinations should be re-boostered
within 5 days. Pets should never be handled without protective gloves
after being exposed to wildlife, due to the potential for carrying
residual saliva from the infected animal. All pets should be
vaccinated as a primary defense against the spread of rabies.

There are 3 primary routes of transmission of the rabies virus, which
is carried in the saliva of the infected animal: 1) the primary route
of transmission is through a bite which breaks the skin of the
victim, 2) salivary contact to an open, fresh wound, or, 3) salivary
contact to the mucous membranes of a potential victim.

When dealing with primary rabies vectors (raccoons, foxes, skunks,
and bats) or unknown animals, such as wildlife, it is recommended
that the animal be handled with protective gloves to prevent viral
transmission. People should stay away from any animal that they have
not been cleared to hold or pet, including owned dogs or cats, and
especially wildlife.

[4] Raccoon, canine exposure - North Carolina

Orange County Animal Services confirmed a positive test for rabies in
a raccoon. It's the county's 11th case of rabies this year [2010].

Officials say a household dog might have been exposed to the raccoon
last week [week of 13 Dec 2010] near Tadley Drive and Ridgecrest
Drive in Chapel Hill. A resident's dog encountered the raccoon during
a walk. The dog was vaccinated against rabies and will receive a
booster shot. Officials say they are still determining whether the
resident was exposed to the virus.

The number of rabies cases is down this year [2010] compared to the
last few decades. Almost 150 cases a year were reported in 1997 and
1998. There has been a steep decline since then. The most recent high
for Orange County was 27 confirmed cases in 2006.

[5] Skunk, human exposure - Pennsylvania

[Skunks are] not the most glamorous part of being a Wildlife
Conservation Officer (WCO) but it's an aspect that WCO Gerald Kapral
has been dealing with a lot this year [2010]. The skunk population
has exploded in Kapral's district, which covers central and eastern
Luzerne County. It's reached the point where Kapral responds to 2
skunk complaints a day, several times a week. This year [2010],
Kapral estimated, he has dealt with at least 100 skunks.

One of the skunk complaints that Kapral dealt with 3 weeks ago turned
out to be a bona-fide rabies case. It occurred in Kirby Park, where a
skunk began following an individual around the park during the day.
Obviously the animal wasn't right, and the individual was able to
shoo the skunk into a pet carrier, but not before being bit on the finger.

The person took the skunk home that night and the next day it was
found dead inside the pet carrier. The Pennsylvania Game Commission
was contacted, and the agency immediately tested it for rabies. The
test came back positive.

There's a good chance that the skunk in Kirby Park isn't the only one
that has rabies. When a population, such as skunks, gets as high as
it is right now, rabies and distemper can spread rapidly.

Dog tests positive for rabies near Bridgeville
----------------------------------------------
Humboldt County health officials are urging animal owners to make
sure their pets are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations after a
dog in the Bridgeville area tested positive for rabies.

As a precaution, 5 people who came in contact with the dog started
post-exposure treatment over the weekend [25-26 Dec 2010]. Treatment
costs more than USD 2000 and involves 4 visits to an emergency room
within a 2-week period. 4 other unvaccinated pets that had contact
with the dog were euthanized per California regulations.

A Dalton, Minnesota man was bitten by a coyote on Christmas Day [25
Dec 2010] while the man was out walking his puppy.

According to the Otter Tail County Sheriff's Office, the 48-year-old
victim was walking his puppy near the Dalton trailer court at about
9:45 p.m. when a coyote approached them and tried to attack the dog.
The puppy owner, also the victim, trying to protect his puppy stepped
between the 2 animals and fought the coyote off, but he received
puncture marks in both hands during the scuffle. The victim was taken
to Lake Region Hospital in Fergus Falls and given [post exposure
prophylaxis] rabies shots.

The coyote has not been found.

the winter been such that this may be the case? Or was the animal
truly rabid? Since the animal has not been found, this last question
is impossible to answer. - Mod.TG]

On 27 Dec 2010, a 6-week-old calf from Guernsey County was confirmed
rabid by the Ohio Department of Health Laboratory. The calf was
housed in a modern, closed feeder calf barn owned by a Nebraska firm
and locally managed, according to the Cambridge-Guernsey County
Health Department.

The calf came from a south central Pennsylvania farm and auction on
11 Nov 2010. It was shipped to Ohio with 142 other calves to the
Guernsey County operation. The calf was tethered, other than for a
brief period on 29 Dec 2010. The manager reported the calf first
showed illness on 18 Dec 2010 and a gastrointestinal illness was suspected.

On 23 Dec 2010 the calf died and an autopsy was performed. The
veterinarian observed no significant gross pathology. The signs
described by the caretakers raised his [the veterinarian's] concerns
about rabies, so the veterinarian personally delivered the head of
the animal to the Ohio Department of Agriculture, Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory on 23 Dec 2010. The brain was removed and sent
to ODH (Ohio Department of Health) Laboratory, where the calf tested
positive [for rabies] on 27 Dec 2010.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subsequently confirmed
that the calf was infected with the eastern raccoon rabies variant.
This strain is common in Pennsylvania and Eastern United States, but
had never been found in Guernsey County. The Cambridge-Guernsey
County Health Department interviewed caretakers and management about
potential human exposures to the calf. An exposure was considered to
be saliva into an open wound or mucous membrane that occurred up to
10 days prior to the calf's onset of illness. Although no one was
bitten, there were concerns that there was saliva exposed to chapped
and cracked hands, common during winter weather. Persons determined
to be at risk are under a physician's care for prophylactic treatment.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture quarantined the entire facility on
28 Dec 2010. The owners, under the supervision of the Ohio Department
of Agriculture, made the decision to euthanize approximately 68
calves -- all those with even a remote possibility of exposure to the
sick calf.

A skunk has tested positive for rabies in the Darlington Heights area
of Prince Edward County, according to a news release from the County.
Prince Edward County Animal Control and the Prince Edward County
Health Department confirmed the case of rabies on 5 Jan 2011.

"One dog was on a chain and one was in a pen and the skunk came up to
the dog and fought with the one on the chain and then it bit the
other one through the fence and the owner saw this happen and he shot
the skunk," Foster detailed.

In this incident occurring this past weekend [1-2 Jan 2011], Ray
Foster, Chief Animal Control Officer for Prince Edward County said
the 2 dogs had not been vaccinated against rabies. Foster picked the
skunk up and it was sent to the state lab on Monday [3 Jan 2011] and
it was confirmed Wednesday [5 Jan 2011]. The dogs, according to
Foster, had to be put down.

Botetourt Co. dairy farms under observation for rabies
------------------------------------------------------
The Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and Virginia Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) are asking livestock owners
to take more precautions for rabies, after noticing an increased
number of rabies cases in livestock in the Western part of the
Commonwealth. According to a VDACS news release and Bobby Parker, a
spokesman with the VDH, the VDH has placed dairy cows at 2 separate
Botetourt County dairies under observation for 6 months, due to
exposure to a rabid cat and another rabid wild animal. Parker said
neither case appears to be related, and so far no tests have come
back positive for the disease. Parker added that there is no danger
to the milk supply as long as the milk is pasteurized.

Dr. Julia Murphy, State Public Health Veterinarian with VDH, said in
the release, "Each year in Virginia, 8-10 cows and 1 or 2 horses are
confirmed with rabies," Dr. Murphy said, "and occasionally rabies is
confirmed in other livestock such as sheep."
