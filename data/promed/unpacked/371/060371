Influenza A H9N2 virus in Pet Parakeets
---------------------------------------
Scientists at the Japanese National Institute of Animal Health recently
diagnosed influenza A virus strains in some imported parakeets that died
after arriving in Japan. Masaji Mase and colleagues report that this is the
first time the H9N2 viruses have been discovered in pet birds; prior to this
incident only chickens and mice were known to be susceptible to these
viruses.
According to Terrence Tumpey from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) in
Athens, GA, H9N2 is not a threat to humans in its current form, only causing
mild symptoms. The USDA's concern is the virus's kinship to a cousin called
H5N1, which normally only infects chickens. But in 1997, H5N1 made an
alarming leap into humans, infecting 18 people in Hong Kong and killing 6.
In an effort to contain the virus outbreak, masses of chickens in the city's
open markets were destroyed. Tumpey says the more benign H9N2 virus could
become a critical threat to humans if it mutates or combines with the more
aggressive H5N1 strain. Mase and colleagues are calling for the
establishment of quarantine and surveillance precautions in any country that
deals in imported birds.
