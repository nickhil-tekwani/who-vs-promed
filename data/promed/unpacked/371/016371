3rd horse catches herpes at racetrack
----------------------------------------
A 3rd case of equine herpes was found this week at the Northville Downs,
according to the Michigan Department of Agriculture.
The infected horse since has been euthanized, and the barn containing the
stall used by Pam's Cadet is under quarantine until 4 Feb 2005.
The virus is not transmissible to humans or other animals but can be deadly
to horses, said state Agriculture Department spokesman Dominic Perrone.
The latest horse to get sick, Pam's Cadet, began to exhibit symptoms of the
disease last Friday. Testing at the Michigan Diagnostic Center for
Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University confirmed the
diagnosis.
Perrone said the virus' spread is not uncommon, but the fact that it hit a
2nd barn that was not adjacent to the site of the first outbreak is
alarming. "The fact that the virus went to a noncontiguous adjacent barn
is cause for concern," Perrone said. "Our investigation is focusing on the
fact that it was not a contiguous move. We are trying to find the link
between the 2 barns, anything that could have potentially spread the virus.
We are hoping to move those horses so that we can lock down that barn and
disinfect."
Infections occur through inhalation of aerosols, by direct contact with
another horse, or indirectly through contaminated equipment feed and
humans. Signs of the disease can be discovered as early as 2 to 5 days
after a horse has contracted the disease.
A separate barn at the Northville Downs racetrack was quarantined after 2
horses were found to have equine herpes. The 2 horses, which contracted the
disease last month, also have been euthanized. Other animals are being
given separate food and water sources as a precaution.
Northville Downs remains open for horse racing while the barns are under
the quarantine. Northville Downs officials did not return phone calls
seeking comment for this story.
