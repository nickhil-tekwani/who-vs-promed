State health officials say they're investigating the cause of an
illness that sickened more than 100 guests and staff members at the
Georgia Aquarium.

Georgia Division of Epidemiology officials tell WSB-TV that
_Cyclospora_ made the people sick. The Centers for Disease Control
says it's a parasite which causes an intestinal infection.

Guests at 3 catered events at the aquarium in late July [2011] had
week-long bouts of diarrhea a few days later. Health officials haven't
determined the source of the breakout, but said they're investigating
salad mix, fresh basil, and cherry tomatoes since those items were
served at all 3 events.

Wolfgang Puck Catering CEO Carl Schuster said his firm, which prepares
food at aquarium events, is awaiting reports from health officials. He
said the company adheres to the highest safety standards.
