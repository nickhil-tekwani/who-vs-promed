Russia: 1st Fatal Case of Tick-borne Encephalitis in the Sverdlovskaya Region
---------------------------------------------------
The 1st fatal case of tick-borne encephalitis of the year has been recorded
in the Sverdlovskaya Region. Every year there are several victims of this
infection in the central Urals.
According to the Regional Epidemiological Surveillance Centre, the man who
died was a resident of the village of Kedrovka, which is located in the
Berezovsky area. He was born in 1946 in the Urals and had never been
vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis.
He was bitten by ticks on 28 May 2004, however he did not seek medical
attention immediately. Several days later, he felt unwell and was admitted
to Berezovsky City Hospital. On 10 Jun 2004 his condition worsened and he
was transferred to the intensive care unit and required assisted
ventilation. Despite this he died on 14 Jun 2004.
The provisional assessment of local physicians is that he died as a result
of tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. However, this diagnosis has to
be confirmed by laboratory tests.
At the present time, several tens of people in the Sverdlovskaya Region are
receiving treatment for tick-borne encephalitis. However, none are
seriously ill. Nonetheless local health officials are advising the
population to seek medical treatment immediately if bitten by ticks.
The Regional Epidemiological Surveillance Centre is emphasizing that the
tick-borne encephalitis virus prevalent in that Urals is distinct from the
virus present in western Russia, and is responsible for more serious
disease and a higher frequency of death. The local heath specialists are
cooperating with virologists in Moscow in a large-scale study of the
molecular epidemiology of tick-borne encephalitis.

[Tick-borne encephalitis is caused by closely related but distinct
flaviviruses. 3 subtypes are recognised by the ICTV at present: A
far-eastern subtype, a Siberian subtype and a European subtype. The
Siberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and
is transmitted predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_, whereas the
European subtype causes central European encephalitis and is transmitted by
the tick _Ixodes ricinus_. The former causes the more serious disease, with
mortality that can reach 25 percent, whereas mortality in the case of the
latter seldom reaches 5 percent. Effective vaccines are available against
each subtype, but information on the extent of their application in disease
control is scarce.
In view of the fact that these viruses are enzootic/endemic within their
effective ranges and the diseases they cause are vaccine-preventable,
ProMED-mail will cease to post routine reports of outbreaks. However,
reports of tick-borne encephalitis of unusual extent or of particular
epidemiological significance will continue to be reported. - Mod.CP]
