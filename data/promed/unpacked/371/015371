Based on my brief visits to Manhattan, I wonder whether feral cats
might be cycling the raccoon strain back into the raccoon population.
In cats, the raccoon strain is known to be inapparent to the casual
observer.

If authorities are vaccine baiting with the baits we use in Canada for
raccoons, cats would be unlikely to take the bait, which has a
marshmallow-based attractant.

Based on the formula that I have developed since 1991 to estimate
feral cat populations, based on shelter intake and killing and kitten
adoption from the stray and feral population, the total New York City
feral cat population is probably about 36 000, mostly on Manhattan.

This is relatively low for a major metropolitan area, but the feral
cat density is greatly inhibited by the density of traffic and lack of
access for cats to much of the human habitat, that is, in high-rise
buildings.

This maybe could happen in some places, but I am skeptical that it
might be happening in Manhattan:

Firstly, there is no strain of rabies specific to cats, and cats are
not known to be a primary host or major vector of rabies. There are
far more cats at large than dogs, so with canine rabies officially
extinguished in the US, cats are found to be rabid more often, mostly
from tangling with raccoons, but they are seldom implicated in
transmission of cases.

Secondly, to my awareness the last known appearance of rabies among
cats in New York City was on Staten Island in June through August of
2006. Three rabid cats and 7 rabid raccoons turned up in the same
vicinity over a 5-month interval.

Thirdly, many and perhaps most feral cats in New York City have been
vaccinated and sterilized, and are under regular observation by
feeders. New York City has 3 of the oldest and largest feral cat
sterilization and vaccination projects in the US, and if any of the
cats they work with were rabid, alarms would soon sound.

Fourthly, I personally helped to trap, sterilize, vaccinate, and
return to their colonies 320 feral cats in northern Fairfield County,
Connecticut in 1991-1992 as part of a project that created a "rabies
barrier" of vaccinated feral cats between the raccoon population and
the owned but free-roaming cat population. The results of this project
were instrumental in popularizing neuter/return feral cat control
nationwide.

We were working in a raccoon rabies hot zone, and in fact, I picked up
3 confirmed rabid raccoons while trapping feral cats in the largest of
the 8 colonies we vaccinated and sterilized.

But we didn't find any rabid cats. Moreover, no rabid feral cats ever
were found in any of those colony areas. There was one rabid cat,
though: an unvaccinated pet cat, who got outside one night and fought
with a raccoon within a block of where I'd picked up one of the rabid
raccoons and about 6 feral cats.

What this experience suggested, basically, was that savvy feral cats
usually don't mess with raccoons, who are nest predators of kittens
and are big enough to knock a cat's eyeballs out with a swipe of the
paw, a type of injury we did see twice, in big toms who had obviously
engaged in boxing matches with raccoons that they lost, big time.
There were no bite wounds associated with those injuries.

Dim-witted, occasionally roaming pet cats do tangle with raccoons, and
are more likely to become infected by rabies.

Nationwide, there are about 6 to 7 million feral cats at large in
winter, and up to about 12-13 million in summer these days. This
compares to about 30 million free-roaming pet cats.

You'll see a lot of higher numbers thrown about, but those are
guesstimates from people who have not really done any serious
statistical research of the matter.

Additional comments from Bryan Kortis <brykort@cs.com> of Neighborhood
Cats, the largest of the many NYC feral cat sterilization and
vaccination projects:

"There are probably tens of thousands of free-roaming cats in NYC, but
the vast majority are in the outer boroughs, not Manhattan where TNR
[trap/neuter/release] efforts have been intensive over the past 10
years -- though even before that, most of the cats were in Brooklyn,
Queens, Staten Island, and Bronx.

"I believe there have been a few cases of cat rabies since then, but
they're rare. Biggest concern is on Staten Island where rabies has
apparently spiked in the raccoon population. The theory that cats are
re-cycling raccoon rabies is not borne out by any facts I'm aware of,
that's just sheer speculation with no empirical foundation.

"We're tracking about 9000 to 10 000 cats and many more have been
TNR'ed who we're not tracking. Estimates are 10 000 free-roaming cats
were spayed/neutered in 2009 alone. By no means, however, are most of
NYC's free-roaming cats sterilized and vaccinated based on the
ever-growing demand for our services and the lack of decline in cat
intake at city shelters over the past several years."

---
Regarding the numbers Kortis provides, if 18 000 of the estimated 36
000 NYC feral cats are sterilized and vaccinated, the fecundity and
brief life span of most feral cats would combine to produce about 10
000 cats in need of sterilization each and every year. There would not
be a slowdown until the number already sterilized within the surviving
population topped 25 000.

Of the 10 000 sterilized and vaccinated per year, from 6000 to 9000
would be replacing mortality among the 18 000 who were already
sterilized and vaccinated, so the net gain would be 1000 to 4000
sterilized and vaccinated cats in the population.

I can't be more precise about the mortality rate, because while feral
cat mortality runs very high in most places, longevity increases after
cats are sterilized (because they roam less), and NYC, though it does
have some coyotes, foxes, and other predators of cats, has far fewer
than most US communities. Probably NYC has lower feral cat mortality
than most places, but how much lower?

We're actually talking about the same territory regarding discussion
of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. Bryan, who lives there,
correctly cites the borough; when I wrote "mostly on Manhattan," I
meant the contiguous area of the city, exclusive of Staten Island, and
forgot about the rivers that separate Manhattan from those boroughs
that don't have "island" in their names.

[What an excellent discussion! ProMED-mail is grateful and
appreciative to Dr Baker, Mr Clifton, and Mr Kortis.

And what a perfect opportunity to remind pet owners to vaccinate their
pets. It may save their lives and even yours. Whether you have a dog,
or a cat, or some other pet, vaccination against rabies is critical
for their protection and is cheap insurance to protect your life.

Dr Baker brought up an interesting point regarding oral rabies bait.
One of the keys to successful oral rabies vaccination bait is
acceptance by the target species. Several flavors of bait exist
including fish, poultry, beef, cheese, and a mixture of flavors. While
I am not sure how the marshmallow bait came about, I know it was used
as a target for foxes, and the spillover was raccoon acceptance of the
bait.

While flavor is important in attracting the desired target, there is
also an odor effect on the individuals putting out the baits. Baits
are generally put out from an airplane with a hopper of sorts that
must be loaded with the bait. Imagine how fish bait smells on a hot
summer day in a plane! Of course the sweet smell of marshmallow after
a few hours in a plane may not be any more desirable, I am sure. Bait
flavors are selected on the basis of the desired target, not on the
comfort of the individuals loading the hopper of the plane. - Mod.TG]
