Rural anthrax (3 outbreaks) in the Province of Buenos Aires
----------------------------------------------------------
In the partido (county) of Carlos Casares there were 2 outbreaks in February and March 2019:
(1) The 1st was at an inn ("Tambo") where 7 Holland Argentino cows in a dairy herd died; they were diagnosed clinically and microbiologically confirmed by the isolation of _Bacillus anthracis_. The affected herd was partially vaccinated, and it is possible that the affected animals had not been vaccinated. The carcasses were soaked with 5% formalin and buried. The outbreak was reported to the provincial and national sanitary control agencies.

(2) The 2nd outbreak, also in Carlos Casares, was in a breeding herd neighbouring the previous herd, and where 2 cattle died from the same cause [and presumably similarly confirmed]. [The herd] was only partially vaccinated. It is in a high-risk zone for flooding, close to the Rio Salado, and ecologically suitable [high calcium levels, high pH] for the survival and maintenance of _B. anthracis_ spores.

(3) The 3rd outbreak occurred in the county of Olavarria, Recalde municipality, in May 2019. This is also in a low-lying area and a short distance from a local epidemic involving 8 outbreaks [4 Mar 2013 Anthrax - Argentina (03): (BA) bovine, human 20130304.1570248; starting in late February 2013]. The estancia [small farm] is dedicated to breeding cattle. Normally the cattle are well vaccinated, but there is a suspicion that it might have been incomplete, with a single death. The carcass was disposed of using the traditional "tapado controlado" method [see 13 Mar 2018 Anthrax, bovine - Argentina (02): (BS) alternative disposal of carcasses 20180313.5684083]. There were no human cases, and the outbreak was reported to the provincial and national sanitary control agencies.

[Olavarria is one of the major beef breeding districts in the country, and off and on has suffered repeated outbreaks. And in such an area of high risk, and high cost, it is very important to make sure that all livestock is regularly vaccinated, even when one has enjoyed a few years free of disease. Yet again, our thanks to Ramon for this update on Buenos Aires Province.
