Between January and April of this year [2013], 8 confirmed cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS] due to hantavirus [infections], in 3 departments, were reported by the Vice Minister of Health Martin Maturano.

Of this total number of cases, 4 occurred in Entre Rios and Villa Tunari in Cochabamba [department], where one death was registered; 3 cases were confirmed in Bermejo, Villamontes and Padcaya in Tarija [department]; and one [case] in Palos Blancos, La Paz [department].

"I instructed the epidemiological units constituted in the endemic municipalities to help with the state of this situation and immediately carry out appropriate actions, above all in [dealing with] the agent (mice) that permit transmission [of the virus]," said Maturano.

Rodents, especially deer mice or long-tail mice that inhabit rural areas, are carriers of the hantavirus [Vesper mice, not deer mice, are the reservoir rodents in this area. Deer mice are reservoir hosts in North America and do not occur in the Amazon basin in Bolivia. - Mod.TY]. An infected mouse has virus in its saliva, urine and feces and transmits it to humans via the respiratory route.

HPS is characterized by fever, myalgia (muscle pain), gastrointestinal symptoms and rapid deterioration of respiratory function with respiratory insufficiency. The mortality rate is nearly 50 per cent.

The Ministry of Health recommends ventilation of closed spaces for 30 minutes, spraying with water and bleach, maintaining the outside of houses free of grass and litter, taking care to keep food stuffs and water out of reach of the rodents, and closing any openings.

[The specific hantavirus involved in this or previous cases this year (2013) in Bolivia, or those in 2012, are not given.

In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases is Laguna Negra virus and its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_ (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg), the small vesper mouse and _C. callosus_ (https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg), the large vesper mouse. Other hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) that have been found in lowland Bolivia and can cause HPS include:
- Bermejo (_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_)

The New Mexico Health Department confirmed Friday [19 Apr 2013] that a 45-year-old McKinley County woman has contracted the 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] this year in the state.

The patient has been hospitalized at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, where she is listed as being in satisfactory condition, according to a press release from the state Health Department. The press release states that May 2013 will mark the 20th anniversary of the sometimes fatal disease's appearance [recognition] in the state.

In 1993, a massive investigation by public health officials from federal, state, and local agencies quickly discovered that a previously unknown hantavirus [named Sin Nombre virus Mod.TY] was the cause of the illnesses, and the deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] was mainly responsible for excreting the virus in its droppings and urine.

To protect yourself, avoid contact with mice and other rodents. Other important steps are:
- Air out closed-up buildings before entering.
- Seal up homes and cabins so mice can't enter.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and cough which progresses to respiratory distress. The symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after rodent exposure.

There is no treatment for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, however, chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early.

According to a press release, New Mexico had one case of a hantavirus [infection] last year [2012], which was fatal, in a 20-year-old woman from Rio Arriba County. In 2011, New Mexico had 5 cases; 3 were fatal including a 51-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 35-year-old man from Torrance County, and a 23-year-old man from McKinley County. New Mexico has had a total of 92 lab-confirmed hantavirus cases with 37 fatalities since the disease was discovered, the highest number of cases for any state in the nation. Nationally, since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports a total of 617 cases with a fatality rate of 35 per cent.

[This report [USA, New Mexico] does not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for this case, but is most likely Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_, which is widely distributed in North America and frequently invades houses, especially during cold, winter weather. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. It will be of interest to know the outcome of any laboratory tests done. The case fatality rate for Sin Nombre virus infections is 38-40 per cent, with a higher risk of death in those patients who seek medical attention late in the course of their disease.
