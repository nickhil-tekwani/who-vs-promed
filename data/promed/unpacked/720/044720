We would be pleased to hear from anyone (in Europe, especially) who
has recently diagnosed this genotype of rotavirus in either a research or
an outbreak setting. Marc.Widdowson@rivm.nl

Outbreak of infection with unusual rotavirus (G9P6) in the neonatal
ward of a Dutch hospital
-----------------------------
Thirty-eight cases of rotavirus diarrhoea in infants have occurred in
the neonatal and paediatric wards of a Dutch hospital since 10 Sep
1999 compared with 13 cases throughout 1998 in the whole hospital.
The cases were confirmed by latex agglutination and specimens from 17
cases at different stages of the outbreak have been shown to be rotavirus
genotype G9P6 on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel
electrophoresis at the National Institute of Public Health and
Environment (Rijksinstituut voor de Volksgezondheid en Milieu,
RIVM). This genotype (G9P6) has not been identified previously in the
Netherlands but has emerged in other parts of the world, causing illness
even in neonates (who are usually resistant) (1,2).
Thirty-one of the 38 cases had stayed for at least one day in one of the
4 rooms of the incubator section of a childrens ward. The incubator
section has 4 rooms. No particular room has been implicated, but
investigations are in progress. Ninety-five babies have been exposed to
this section since the outbreak began, giving an attack rate in the
incubator section of 33%. The other 7 cases arose in other areas of
the childrens wards, but all these cases had some connection with the
incubator section (for example, visiting mothers). In the incubator
section, infants are in closed or open incubators or in cots. None is
exclusively breast fed; most are also fed with either human milk
(obtained by pump) or formula milk, using a mixture of nasogastric
tubes, syringes, and bottles. Twenty-four cases were diagnosed or
became ill by 1 week of age; some as early as 2 days old. Another 12
cases were under 2 months of age, and 2 cases were over 2 months of
age. Males and females were affected equally.
The outbreak has been characterised by 3 clusters of 10 to 15 cases,
separated by as much as a month during which no symptomatic or
previously diagnosed infants were present. Transmission continued
despite hygiene measures and closing the wards for several days for
disinfection. One case developed symptoms 3 days after entering the
newly cleaned ward. It is not clear why the outbreak has occurred in
clusters and what the vehicle(s) of infection have been. The roles of
asymptomatic infections, possible carrier states in staff, and possible
lack of maternal antibodies to this rare genotype among babies are being
investigated.
