They died one after the other in a matter of minutes. Fifty cows killed by sorghum, a cereal. At least this is the hypothesis the experts of the zooprophylactic institute in charge of the analyses are working on. "I also asked the farmers in the area; no one remembers a similar fact by heart," assures the mayor of Sommariva del Bosco, Marco Pedussia.

The protagonist of this story is [GO], [age] 58, still upset by what has happened to him. "A disaster" -- he says -- "The vets have just arrived to collect the ear tags of the cows. The truck is already waiting to take them away," he says. With him is his grandson, who was also present on Saturday [6 Aug 2022] when one-third of their cattle died in a meadow.

The cows died intoxicated, suffocated by sorghum, a plant growing well in drought conditions but is toxic to cows. "The farm explained to us the 1st cut of the evening cereal was used to make hay, but the farmer was told he could now bring the animals," explains the mayor.

After 10 minutes of being in the field, however, the cows started shaking and falling to the ground. "You saw them gasping and dying," says the farmer. In a very short time, the camp was filled with people, the ASL veterinarians arrived, even the forest police and many of [GO]'s colleagues. Together they managed to drag away most of the livestock and save the animals by preventing them from eating the toxic cereal that, in young plants, can develop toxic substances, affecting the nervous system of the animals. Death occurs by asphyxiation.

The zooprophylactic institute is still carrying out tests on the material taken Saturday [6 Aug 2022] in Sommariva del Bosco to verify this is the cause of death of the animals. "I don't know what the cause is, I don't accuse anyone" -- says the farmer -- "I sowed the field. We wondered what to do with this drought, I researched and found cereal was also well suited to these climates. I had never used it, but the prospect of not having hay for the winter convinced me to give it a try. Now I feel like I've brought my animals to death," he says.

[GO] comes from a farming family; he has been grazing cows since he was 6. "I've already had a heart attack in my life; this story in moments brings me a 2nd [heart attack]" he confides. He is terrified and worried. "I am fond of my animals one by one, and I also think about the economic damage. It's huge."

By evening [8 Aug 2022] the carcasses will be removed; the veterinarian has been monitoring the health of the 30 cows which survived last Saturday [6 Aug 2022]. "Most are fine, but some still have some signs of intoxication."

[Plants in the genus _Sorghum_ may accumulate prussic acid. Prussic acid, hydrocyanic acid, and hydrogen cyanide are all terms relating to cyanide poisoning. The _Sorghum_ spp of plants and other common plants may accumulate large quantities of cyanogenic glycosides (a sugar compound with cyanide attached), which are located in the outer tissue or epidermal layer of the plant. Prussic acid is also higher in young plants than older ones, but it concentrates more in the leaves than the stems.

An enzyme resides in the inner or mesophyll leaf tissues. When an event stresses the plant, such as frost, drought, drought followed by rain and a sudden burst of growth, or trauma to the plant, the mesophyll portion of the plant or leaf releases the enzyme, which breaks down the cyanogenic glycosides releasing the cyanide compound and the sugar. The sugar makes the plant tasty and cyanide makes the plant deadly.

Sadly, this is not an uncommon event. Forages high in prussic acid may be used for hay if they are given adequate drying or curing time. The amount of time needed depends upon the level of the prussic acid in the environment as well as the ambient temperatures and humidity.

If the field is cured and baled, the regrowth of the plants may also be toxic for the reasons mentioned previously.

The forages may be tested for levels of prussic acid. Prussic acid dissipates after the plant is cut for hay, or otherwise sampled for testing. Veterinary diagnostic labs usually do the testing. Some locations may advocate for a field test, while others will encourage lab testing. Plants need to be sealed in a container, such as glass jar, or sealable bag and shipped overnight on ice, to arrive at the lab inside of 24 hours from cutting the original plant. Other individuals believe a field test is more accurate because the level of cyanide can drop quickly in cut plants. Check with your veterinary diagnostic lab on their particular requirements.

Times of drought, just after a frost, rapid growth after a rain, or regrowth of the plant following cutting are all times to be cautious with these plants.

What are signs of cyanide poisoning in cattle:
- Signs of cyanide poisoning can occur within 15 to 20 minutes, occasionally up to a few hours, after animals consume the toxic forage.
- More often, it is so acute the animals are found dead.
- Clinical signs, when noticed, occur in rapid succession:
*Excitement, rapid pulse and generalized muscle tremors occur initially, followed by rapid and labored breathing, staggering and collapse.
*Signs also may include salivation (drooling), lacrimation (runny eyes), and voiding of urine and feces.
*The mucous membranes are usually bright pink, and the venous blood will be a characteristic bright cherry red.

"Plants in the genus _Sorghum_ may also accumulate nitrates. Unlike prussic acid, which may dissipate when the plant is cut and dried, such as for hay, nitrates are always there.

"Depending upon which plant is in question, such as sorghum, it may accumulate nitrates as well as cyanide. A visual inspection of the plants will not allow someone to know if the forages are high in cyanide or nitrates.

"Johnsongrass, pearl millet, and sorghum/sudangrass are the forages most often found with high nitrate levels, but others can accumulate high nitrate under stressful conditions. Excessive fertilization with poultry litter or animal manure is a common cause of nitrate buildup in plants.

"Any stress on the plant which causes abrupt stoppage of growth can also contribute to nitrate buildup (drought, herbicide damage, even late afternoon wilting).

"Nitrates will persist in the grass when hayed. Prussic acid does not. If considering cutting for hay, consider a nitrate test first, especially if the field received heavy fertilization.

"Nitrates are higher in younger plants than in older plants. Higher concentrations are in the stem and lower third of the plant.

"Regrowth contains the most nitrates and prussic acid.

"What are the signs of nitrate poisoning in cattle? The most likely signs of nitrate poisoning are:
- Difficult and painful breathing
- Cyanotic membranes
- Rapid breathing
- Muscle tremors
- Weakness
- Low tolerance to exercise
- Incoordination
- Diarrhea
- Frequent urination
- Dark to chocolate-colored blood
- Collapse
- Milk production may also be reduced

"Nitrate poisoning may cause death within one-half hour to 4 hours after signs appear. Signs usually appear when methemoglobin reaches 30% to 40%, and death occurs when methemoglobin reaches 80% to 90%."

In this case, more information is needed to confirm a diagnosis. The forage could be tested to determine what killed the animals. If a necropsy was performed and appropriate testing of the tissues, a diagnosis may also be made.

While there are treatments for these animals, it is important to know if it was cyanide or prussic acid or if was from nitrate/nitrite poisoning. In either case, the treatment is specific and must be administered very quickly. - Mod.TG
