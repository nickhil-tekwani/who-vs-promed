The 1st case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has been recorded in
the Neftecumskiy region of Stavrapolskiy Krai. In all, 21 people have
been admitted to hospital for assessment. According to the
Rospotrebnadzor [Health Protection] administration, the number of
people experiencing bites by ticks increased 1.5-fold during the
course of the past week in the Stavropolskiy Krai. In total, 745
people, including 266 children, have sought medical care as a result
of tick bites.

A warm winter and an early spring have resulted in early awakening
and activation of the tick vectors of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic
fever. Tick infestation of humans and animals continues to increase
on account of the higher temperatures.

Last year [2008], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was registered in
most territories of South Federal Okrug, particularly in the Rostov,
Volgogradskiy and Astrakhan Oblasts and in the Stavropolskiy and
Krasnoyarsk Krais, and in Dagestan, Ingushetia and Chechnya. More
than 250 people became seriously ill, and 20 have died during the
past 10 years.

[During the last epidemic season, the Stavropolskiy Krai and Rostov
Oblast were the worst regions for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. 80
cases were recorded in the Stavropolskiy Krai in 2008, including 6
fatal outcomes; another 81 cases were recorded in the Rostov Oblast,
including 3 fatal cases. Benign weather conditions are favoring an
increase in the tick population during this year (2009) as well. - Mod.NP]
