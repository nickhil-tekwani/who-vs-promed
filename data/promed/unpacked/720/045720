A 2nd sample from a sheep farm in Dromoloxia has a high probability of
being tainted with foot and mouth disease [FMD]. The news has put a damper
on hopes that the sample would test negative, as it had in the 1st case a
week ago.

Last week, a herd of sheep from Dromolaxia in the Larnaca district had
initially tested positive in Cyprus, but subsequent tests at the European
Lab in the UK found no traces of the disease.

FMD is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cattle and
pigs. It can also infect deer, goats, sheep and other bovids with cloven
hooves.

Relief from the results of the 1st sample has now given way to renewed
concern, with the European Lab yesterday [3 Nov 2007] reporting back to
Cypriot authorities that there were strong indications of the 2nd batch
being contaminated. Late on Friday [2 Nov 2007] night, an upbeat
agriculture minister Fotis Fotiou said the 2nd sample should "logically"
also test negative. The bad news from the UK came just a few hours later.
The definitive results will be out tomorrow [Mon 5 Nov 2007].

Pending their announcement, the government has again quarantined the area
in a 3 km radius, with farmers urged to keep their livestock inside the
fences and authorities putting up signs warning of possible contamination.
Hunters are also advised to keep away from the affected area today [4 Nov
2007], the start of hunting season.

Fotiou said that, whatever the outcome of the lab tests, EU experts would
be arriving on the island for on-site inspections sometime next week. The
inspectors could also help explain why the previous tests in Cyprus and the
UK were different.
