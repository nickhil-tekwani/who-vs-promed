Tulare County Animal Services is working with several medical programs to contain an outbreak of the canine distemper virus (CDV) at its shelter.

According to animal services officials, CDV was found in dogs and a coyote that came into the shelter between 23 Oct 2019 and 28 Oct 2019. Several cases were discovered after the dogs were sent to partner rescues. Since then, 13 dogs at the shelter have tested positive for the virus.

CDV is a highly contagious disease that is most often spread through the bodily fluids of an infected animal. The virus is often fatal, and if dogs do survive, they are usually left with permanent damage to their nervous system.

"Several dogs with clinical signs came to the shelter from the community, so we believe the current disease is originating outside of the shelter in largely unvaccinated animal populations," notes Cassandra Heffington, TCAS Manager. "This means dogs are potentially being exposed prior to being vaccinated at the shelter, coming into the shelter and showing clinical signs while in the shelter, and passing the disease to other dogs in the shelter."

In response to the outbreak, TCAS has closed its dog kennels to the public and has halted the adoption of dogs from the shelter. It has also suspended acceptance of owner-surrendered dogs and is limiting its intake of stray dogs.

TCAS worked with UC Davis, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the San Francisco SPCA to address the issue. It would like to remind pet owners that vaccination is crucial in preventing canine distemper. The vaccination for CDV is very effective and requires 4-48 hours for the dog to begin to see full immunity.

[We don't normally post cases of canine distemper in shelters, because it is relatively common. However, this case is odd, as the article indicates the coyote was inside the shelter. I think it would be unlikely that the workers would not have recognized a coyote, whether it was a puppy or grown. If the coyote puppy or adult was not in the shelter, then one has to wonder whether the shelter has open runs and the coyote, perhaps infected, could have come up to the open runs and exposed other dogs. Nevertheless, the article says the coyote was in the shelter.

This article also indicates that there were other infected dogs coming into the shelter. It is unclear from this article whether the workers at the shelter did not realize on admission that the dogs were displaying signs of canine distemper virus.

Canine distemper is a contagious and serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems of puppies and dogs. The virus can also be found in wildlife such as foxes, wolves, coyotes, raccoons, skunks, mink and ferrets and has been reported in lions, tigers, leopards and other wild cats as well as seals.

Puppies and dogs most often become infected through airborne exposure (through sneezing or coughing) to the virus from an infected dog or wild animal. The virus can also be transmitted by shared food and water bowls and equipment. Infected dogs can shed the virus for months, and mother dogs can pass the virus through the placenta to their puppies.

Because canine distemper also impacts wildlife populations, contact between wild animals and domestic dogs can facilitate the spread of the virus. Canine distemper outbreaks in local raccoon populations can signal increased risk for pet dogs in the area.

All dogs are at risk, but puppies younger than 4 months old and dogs that have not been vaccinated against canine distemper are at increased risk of acquiring the disease.

Initially, infected dogs will develop watery to pus-like discharge from their eyes. They then develop fever, nasal discharge, coughing, lethargy, reduced appetite, and vomiting. As the virus attacks the nervous system, infected dogs develop circling behavior, head tilt, muscle twitches, convulsions with jaw chewing movements and salivation ("chewing gum fits"), seizures, and partial or complete paralysis. The virus may also cause the footpads to thicken and harden, leading to its nickname "hard pad disease."

In wildlife, infection with canine distemper closely resembles rabies. Distemper is often fatal, and dogs surviving usually have permanent, irreparable nervous system damage.

Veterinarians diagnose canine distemper through clinical appearance and laboratory testing. There is no cure for canine distemper infection. Treatment typically consists of supportive care and efforts to prevent secondary infections; control vomiting, diarrhea and neurologic symptoms; and combat dehydration through administration of fluids. Dogs infected with canine distemper [must] be separated from other dogs to minimize the risk of further infection.

Vaccination is crucial in preventing canine distemper.
- A series of vaccinations is administered to puppies to increase the likelihood of building immunity when the immune system has not yet fully matured.
- Avoid gaps in the immunization schedule and make sure distemper vaccinations are up to date.
- Avoid contact with infected animals and wildlife.
- Use caution when socializing puppies or unvaccinated dogs at parks, puppy classes, obedience classes, doggy day care and other places where dogs can congregate.
- Pet ferrets should be vaccinated against canine distemper using a USDA-approved ferret vaccine.
