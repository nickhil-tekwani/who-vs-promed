The Swedish Public Health Agency, or Folkhalsomyndigheten, reported today, 22 Jul 2021, 13 cases of the more serious form of _Vibrio_ infection, all in July 2021. The cases have been reported from the coastal areas in GÃ¶taland and Svealand and, as in previous years, mostly men have fallen ill and the majority of cases are older than 65 years.

_Vibrio_ bacteria can cause milder forms of illness such as ear infection or diarrhea if you happen to swallow water. The bacteria can not penetrate the skin but can cause infection if they come in contact with a wound and can then cause blood poisoning. It is mainly older people, often with weakened immune systems, who are affected. Infected wounds can become inflamed within 1-3 days. Symptoms may include pain from the wound, fever, and other general effects. It is important to get the right treatment quickly. It can be treated with antibacterials.

_Vibrio_ infection became notifiable in 2004 and a case was reported that year [2004]. It concerned a person who had bathed outdoors in a hot tub filled with water from the Baltic Sea and contracted a wound infection. Hot summers such as 2014 and 2018 see more cases of _Vibrio_ infections. In 2018, when the summer was extremely hot, the number of serious _Vibrio_ infections increased sharply in Sweden after swimming, especially in the Baltic Sea.

[Most of the cases are likely due to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ and _V. vulnificus_.

_V. parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera. It lives in brackish saltwater and causes gastrointestinal illness in humans. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever and chills. Usually, these symptoms begin within 24 hours of exposure. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts approximately 3 days. Severe disease is rare and occurs more commonly in persons with weakened immune systems.

Infections with this organism, which can be normal microflora in seawater, have been associated with the consumption of raw, improperly cooked, or cooked and recontaminated fish and shellfish. A correlation exists between the probability of infection and warmer months of the year. Improper refrigeration of seafood contaminated with this organism will allow its proliferation, which increases the possibility of infection.

ProMED covered a large 2005 outbreak in Chile. It was impressive in its size (more than 10 000 cases), continued to spread despite early recognition, and involved clams and mussels rather than the classical oyster vehicle.

_V. vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in saltwater, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with seawater harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc. followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the bloodstream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50%). Over 70% of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5508923/).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: (1) vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and (2) most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just develop gastroenteritis. The range of diseases due to these vibrios are involving more northern geographical areas as overall global warming takes effect.

The lands of Sweden (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lands_of_Sweden) are three traditional parts, each consisting of several provinces, in Sweden. The division into lands goes back to the foundation of modern Sweden, when Gotaland, the land of the Geats, merged with Svealand, the land of the Swedes, to form the country, while Norrland and A-sterland (the latter now Finland) were added later. The lands have no administrative function but are still seen by many Swedes as an important part of their identity. The areas in the south can be seen in a map at the above URL. - Mod.LL
