LEISHMANIASIS, TUBERCULOSIS - SYRIA (02): COMMENT

The moderator comment of ProMED-mail post "Leishmaniasis, tuberculosis - Syria 20121226.1470184" overlooks the reality that in much of the developing world, probably including Syria, street dogs ARE the primary rodent control entities, assisted by feral cats, scavenging birds, and miscellaneous other urban wildlife including street pigs and monkeys, neither of which inhabit Syria.

The role of street dogs in rodent control differs significantly from the roles of feral and domestic cats, hawks, owls, and other rodent predators, in that the dogs consume edible waste which would otherwise feed rodents, as well as hunting rodents themselves. Thus, against rats in particular, who often become too big and dangerous for most cats to attack, dogs do double duty.

Conversely, pigs and monkeys consume edible refuse but do not hunt rats and mice. (Monkeys may grab a rodent if they can, but do not go actively searching for them, unlike dogs, who will nose every wrapping in a pile in hopes a rodent will run out from under it, and will swiftly crunch in their jaws almost every rodent who bolts.)

Accordingly, in practically any developing world context, if you kill off the dogs before instituting reliable waste collection and disposal, you will get far more rodents, along with any diseases that the rodents may carry. In war zones in particular, dogs and other urban wildlife may be the only rodent control that exists, or is likely to, until the return of a stable peace.
