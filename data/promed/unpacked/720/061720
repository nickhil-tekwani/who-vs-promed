The resurgence of bird flu in Chuncheon, Gangwon Province is causing
concerns to health authorities as the H1N1 flu scare continues. A low
pathogenic bird-flu virus was found in excrement of migratory birds in
a reservoir in Chuncheon. Despite the low infectivity, health
authorities claim they cannot rule out danger to humans or mutation
and pledged to stay alert.

The worst-case scenario is that patients infected with the H1N1 virus
could additionally contract bird flu, leading to a mutation that gives
rise to a new super virus. "But that doesn't necessarily mean that a
new form of virus will be formed when the bird flu virus appears amid
the spread of H1N1 virus," a health official said. "But if that did
actually happen, the situation we've seen so far would be a mere
shadow of what lies ahead. That's why we have to take preventive
measures."

Disease prevention headquarters on Tuesday [10 Nov 2009] said it will
vaccinate some 40 000 fowl breeders from the 3rd week of this month
[November 2009] instead of December as originally planned.

[As part of the ongoing control measures for avian influenza in the
Republic of Korea, surveillance has been conducted since September
2008 in all duck farms. On 29 Dec 2008, faecal samples collected from
a duck farm were found to include a virus was identified as low
pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N2. The event was duly
reported to the OIE; all ducks in the affected farm were slaughtered.
The newswire above does not disclose the identity of the current
virus, identified -- in the framework of the ongoing surveillance --
in the excrements of migratory birds in a reservoir in Chuncheon. Such
information will be helpful.

According to OIE's International Animal Health Code, all
low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5 or H7 subtypes are
notifiable, hence termed "low pathogenic notifiable avian influenza"
(LPNAI). The pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses is defined
according to criteria which are detailed in the code: highly
pathogenic viruses are those which have an intravenous pathogenicity
index (IVPI) greater than 1.2 in 6-week-old chickens, or, as an
alternative, cause at least 75 percent mortality in 4-to 8-week-old
chickens infected intravenously. H5 and H7 viruses which do not have
an IVPI greater than 1.2 or cause less than 75 percent mortality in an
intravenous lethality test, should be sequenced to determine whether
multiple basic amino acids are present at the cleavage site of the
haemagglutinin molecule; if the amino acid motif is similar to that
observed for other highly pathogenic isolates, the isolate being
tested should be considered as highly pathogenic notifiable avian
influenza (HPNAI).

LPNAI are all influenza A viruses of H5 and H7 subtype that are not
HPNAI viruses. Further background on the laboratory diagnosis of avian
influenza is available at
