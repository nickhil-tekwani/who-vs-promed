------
The health authorities of the Ministry of Health were informed by the Prefectural Directorate of Health of N'Zerekore of the detection of suspected cases of Ebola with symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding in people who participated in the burial of a nurse from the Goueke health center. She died on 28 Jan 2021, and her burial took place on 1 Feb 2021 in Goueke. The 1st investigation carried out counted 7 cases, all over 25 years old (4 men and 3 women) including 3 cases of death (2 women and 1 man). All cases participated in the funeral of the nurse.

The 1st 3 samples sent to the laboratories of Gueckedou and Conakry were positive for Ebola.

Faced with this situation and in application of the international health regulations (IHR), the Guinean government declares an epidemic of Ebola virus disease in the prefecture of N'Zerekore, sub-prefecture of Gouecke.

A crisis meeting held on 14 Feb 2021 under the chairmanship of the Minister of Health, in the presence of technical and financial partners, international and national, at the ANSS recommended the following measures:

- Isolation of all suspected cases at CTEPI N'Zerekore and Conakry;
- Case investigation to clarify data, identify other suspected cases, and identify all contacts to be isolated;
- Sending of an emergency investigation mission from the central level in support of the local teams in Gouecke;
- Activation of the coordination and technical commissions of the response to Ebola;
- Activation of intersectoral coordination through the One Health platform;
- Supply of sensitization, prevention, diagnostic, and care inputs;
- Opening of a care center for cases detected in Gouecke;
- Acceleration of procurement of Ebola vaccines from WHO;
- Implementation of standard RSI procedures.

The government thanks the technical and financial partners who quickly came forward to express their commitment to the response to this new outbreak of Ebola.

The government reassures the population that all measures are being taken to stem this epidemic as quickly as possible. It invites the populations of the affected areas to respect hygiene and preventive measures and to report to the health authorities in the presence of suggestive signs (fever, diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding).

Three people died of Ebola, and another 5 tested positive for the virus in southeastern Guinea, the 1st possible resurgence of the disease there since the world's worst outbreak in 2013.

One of the victims in Guinea was a nurse who fell ill in late January 2021 and was buried on 1 Feb 2021, National Health Security Agency chief Sakoba Keita told local media.

"Among those who took part in the burial, 8 people showed symptoms: diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding," he said. "Three of them died, and 4 others are in hospital."

Keita said one patient "escaped" but had been found and hospitalised in the capital Conakry. He said the country was in the midst of an Ebola "epidemic situation."

Health Minister Remy Lamah said officials were "really concerned" about the deaths, the 1st since a 2013-2016 epidemic -- which began in Guinea -- left 11 300 dead across West Africa.

A 2nd round of tests is being carried out to confirm the latest Ebola diagnosis, and health workers are working to trace and isolate the contacts of the cases, state health agency ANSS said.

It said Guinea would contact the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international health agencies to acquire Ebola vaccines. The vaccines have greatly improved survival rates in recent years.

[The health minister, Remy Lamah, had earlier spoken of 4 deaths (see ProMED Ebola update (08): Congo DR (NK) Guinea 20210214.8189771). It is not clear why the new toll is lower, but likely due to the confusion of the start of the outbreak.

According to The Guardian [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/13/ebola-kills-four-in-guinea-in-1st-resurgence-of-disease-in-five-years]: "In Guinea's neighbour Liberia, the president, George Weah, put the country's health authorities on heightened alert on Sun 14 Feb 2021. Weah "has mandated the Liberian health authorities and related stakeholders in the sector to heighten the country's surveillance and preventative activities," his office said in a statement.

No cases of Ebola had been detected in Liberia so far, it added. "The president's instruction is intended to ensure Liberia acts proactively to avoid any epidemic situation, the kind Liberia witnessed in 2014."

Weah also told health authorities "to immediately engage communities in towns and villages bordering Guinea and increase anti-Ebola measures," the statement said. - Mod.LK]

Health authorities in Guinea today [14 Feb 2021] declared an outbreak of Ebola in the rural community of Goueke in N'Zerekore prefecture after 3 Ebola cases were confirmed by the national laboratory, marking the 1st time the disease has been reported in the country since an outbreak ended in 2016.

Initial investigations found that a nurse from the local health facility died on the 28 Jan 2021. Following her burial, 6 people who attended the funeral reported Ebola-like symptoms, and 2 of them have died, while the other 4 have been hospitalized.

Guinea was one of the 3 most-affected countries in the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola outbreak which was the largest since the virus was 1st discovered in 1976.

"It's a huge concern to see the resurgence of Ebola in Guinea, a country which has already suffered so much from the disease. However, banking on the expertise and experience built during the previous outbreak, health teams in Guinea are on the move to quickly trace the path of the virus and curb further infections," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. "WHO is supporting the authorities to set up testing, contact-tracing and treatment structures and to bring the overall response to full speed."

During the West African outbreak, WHO and partners supported Guinea to build up its capacity to respond to Ebola, and the country has developed crucial expertise. Guinean health workers played a key role in supporting the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) with its recent outbreaks, with teams of vaccinators helping to train health workers in the DRC.

WHO staff are already on the ground. In addition to surveillance, they will help with ramping up infection prevention and control of health facilities and other key locations and reaching out to communities to ensure they take a key role in the response. WHO is also supporting the country to procure the Ebola vaccine which has proven instrumental in controlling outbreaks in the DRC.

Samples of the confirmed cases have been sent to the Institut Pasteur in Senegal for a full genome sequencing to identify the strain of the Ebola virus.

With the epicentre of the current outbreak in a border area, WHO is already working with health authorities in Liberia and Sierra Leone to beef up community surveillance of cases in their border districts as well as strengthening their capacity to test for cases and conduct surveillance in health facilities. WHO is reaching out to Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal and other countries at risk in the sub-region.

During the West Africa Ebola outbreak there were 28 000 cases, including 11 000 deaths. The outbreak started in Guinea and then moved across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.

[It appears the infrastructure to test for Ebola has not been maintained at an operational level and needs to be quickly reinstituted. Alima cubes need to be put in place if not already there. Protective gear must be reallocated to protect health care workers. Vaccine is being brought into the country. It is unfortunate a supply of vaccine cannot be kept in storage in country, but likely that is a problem of resources to hold the vaccine safely and securely. Effective antivirals, which proved so helpful in the past outbreak, must be restocked if not already in country. In addition, it appears essential to refresh the population's knowledge of protective procedures such as frequent handwashing and proper burial practices. These practices will also help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Since the last Ebola virus disease outbreak was relatively recent, WHO and the country are prepared to respond rapidly, knowing the consequences full well of not doing so. - Mod.LK]

A 4th case of the Ebola virus disease was notified in the Katwa health zone, in the town of Butembo, North Kivu province; it is in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, reported this Sun 14 Feb 2021.

This is a nurse, who has been in contact with one of the 1st 3 cases. She is 22 years old, living in the Musienene health zone, according to the provincial health minister who spoke to 7SUR7.CD.

"Yes, we just registered a 4th case of Ebola. The patient is a nurse who showed symptoms a few days ago. She also has around 60 contacts who are already listed," said Eugene Nzanzu Syalita.

He announced the start of vaccination this week. More than 1200 doses of vaccines are already on site in Butembo as well as teams from the World Health Organization (WHO) to try to cut the chain of contamination.

The cumulative number of cases since the resurgence of the epidemic on 7 Feb 2021 in Biena (Lubero) is now 4 cases, including 2 deaths and 2 patients under treatment in the Katwa health zone in Butembo.

[The increase in cases appears very slow. This latest case is a contact of one of the original cases, thus the chain of transmission is known. This is a good sign that the response is effective. - Mod.LK
