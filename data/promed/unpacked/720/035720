A woman has been placed in home isolation in Suva after having developed measles after arriving into the country from the Philippines on the 9th of this month [February 2020]. This is the 1st case of the disease since 6 Jan [2020], and the Ministry of Health says the patient's husband and son have also been placed on home isolation.

The 35-year-old was well during a health screening at Nadi Airport but developed symptoms of measles the day after her arrival [10 Feb 2020].

The Ministry says that with the Philippines having an ongoing outbreak of measles, it is clear that she became infected with measles in the Philippines and not in Fiji.

The latest case brings to 28 the total number of cases for the outbreak that began on November 7th last year [2019].

Measles has reared its ugly head in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa again as 104 children have been diagnosed with the disease so far this year [2020], while 218 more suspect cases are under scrutiny.

These figures have been compiled from official data of the Health Department provided by different government hospitals, while the actual number of infected children may be much higher. According to the Health Department, a total of 13 229 measles cases were reported in KP in 2018, among which the virus was confirmed in 1515 children. As many as 20 children died of the disease that year [2018]. The last year [2019] saw marked improvement in measles cases as only 288 cases were reported with 3 deaths.

The administration of Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC) said 6 children died of measles in the hospital during the last 3 months. This year [2020], 46 confirmed cases of measles have been registered by the hospital. The emergence of 104 new measles cases during the last 1.5 months has left the health authorities and parents extremely concerned.

One man from the Razmak area of North Waziristan said, while talking to TNN, that his one-year-old daughter 1st had a cough and then a high fever. He said he admitted his daughter to Razmak Hospital, where she was diagnosed with measles and died 6 days after diagnosis despite proper treatment. He said that earlier his 2-year-old niece also died from the disease.

Dr Bilal, trainee registrar at HMC Peshawar, said the measles vaccine is 1st administered to children at the age of 9 months, which produces 70% resistance in the body against the disease. However, he said, a one-year-old child can contract measles if resistance in the body decreases.

Some parents said their children contracted measles despite [receiving the] vaccination. Dr Bilal said the wrong management of the vaccination, such as [improper] storage or administration, may render it ineffective. He said some parents don't administer to their children the 2nd measles vaccine, which is given at the age of 15 months and produces 90% resistance against the disease.

A resident of Charsadda said his 8-month-old son died of measles, as it could not be diagnosed timely.

Dr Bilal said an affected child has a high fever and rashes in the mouth. The body of the affected child is also covered by small red-colored pimples (rash). He said it is an RNA virus, and even doctors cannot diagnose it until the skin of the infected child turns red.

Dr Bilal said the virus becomes active in its season and mostly affects children below one year of age or those who did not get vaccine. He said children with continuous fever and runny nose and eyes must immediately consult a doctor, and such children must be kept separate from other children to avoid spread of the disease.

Abstract
------
In May 2018, measles was introduced in the Dubrovnik region by an adult who recently travelled to Kosovo*. Control measures and an outbreak investigation were implemented: 15 epidemiologically linked cases met the outbreak case definition of a visitor/resident of Dubrovnik-Neretva County with laboratory-confirmed measles and symptom onset beginning on 19 May [2018]. New cases were identified through hospitals and primary care physicians. Throat swabs, urine, and/or serum samples were collected from outbreak cases. RT-PCR detection of viral RNA and IgM/IgG was used to confirm infection. The median age of cases was 33 years, with one 8-month-old infant. Vaccination status was unknown for 9 cases, 3 were unvaccinated, one case had a history of one dose, and 2 cases reported receiving 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine.

There were 11 hospitalisations, and one person developed pneumonia.

Control teams undertook an extensive search of contacts and implemented a range of control measures. Despite the outbreak occurring at the beginning of the summer tourism season, it was contained and did not spread to neighbouring regions. With continuing measles transmission in Europe, even small outbreaks create a burden on the health system in countries that have eliminated measles and illustrate the importance of maintaining high immunisation coverage.

ReliefWeb epidemiological update - measles - 28 Feb 2020

Between 1 Jan and 22 Feb 2020, 6 countries have reported confirmed cases in the Region of the Americas: Argentina (45 cases, including 1 death), Brazil (338 cases, including 1 death), Canada (1 case), Chile (2 cases), the United States of America (5 cases), and Uruguay (2 cases).

In 2019, a total of 20 554 confirmed cases of measles, including 19 deaths, were reported in 14 countries and territories of the Region of the Americas (Ref. 1): Argentina (107 cases), the Bahamas (3 cases), Brazil (18 203 cases, including 15 deaths), Canada (113 cases), Chile (11 cases), Colombia (244 cases, including 1 death), Costa Rica (10 cases), Cuba (1 case), Curacao (1 case), Mexico (20 cases), Peru (2 cases), the United States of America (1282 cases), Uruguay (9 cases), and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (548 cases, including 3 deaths).

The following is a summary of the epidemiological situation of measles for countries that have reported confirmed measles cases in 2020.

In Argentina, a total of 107 confirmed measles cases had rash onset in 2019, and 45 confirmed cases had rash onset in 2020 (Figure 1).

The current epidemic outbreak began in epidemiological week (EW) 35 of 2019 and, as of EW 7 of 2020, there have been 145 confirmed measles cases reported, including one death. Of the 145 cases, 3 were imported from the United States and 4 were imported from Brazil; genotype and lineage are under investigation. For the 138 remaining cases, the origin could not be established, and they are part of the same outbreak.

With respect to the distribution of cases by place of residence, one case is a resident of Cordoba Province (with travel history to Brazil), 118 cases (81.4%) are residents of Buenos Aires Province (including 2 cases imported from the United States), and 26 cases (17.9%) are residents of the city of Buenos Aires (including 4 imported cases).

Among the 145 confirmed cases, 92 (63%) were unvaccinated, 14 (10%) were vaccinated with one dose, and 11 (8%) were vaccinated with 2 doses (Ref. 2). For 28 cases (19%), no information regarding vaccination status was available.

The highest incidence rates are all among children aged less than 5 years: under one-year-olds (4.06 cases per 100 000 population); one-year-olds (2.00 cases per 100 000 population); and 2-4-year-olds (0.80 cases per 100 000 population).

Genotype D8, lineage MVs/Gir Somnath.IND/42.16, has been identified in this outbreak.

Onset of rash for the most recent confirmed case was 16 Feb 2020.

Five people were infected with measles in Los Angeles County after being in contact with an infected international tourist, according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

LA Public Health accumulated a list of places that the infected patient visited between 26 Jan and 1 Feb [2020]. Doctors recommend that those who have been exposed to the measles virus to contact a doctor if they are experiencing symptoms and are not immunized.

In 2019, there were only 20 confirmed cases of measles in [Los Angeles County].

From 2000 to 2018, it has been estimated that 23 million deaths were prevented worldwide due to the vaccination. There is a very low chance of getting infected with measles, as most people are vaccinated at a young age. The Center of Disease Control recommends getting 2 doses of the measles vaccination, which is 97% effective against the virus.

If a person is unsure if they are up to date on their shots, it is suggested to find their vaccination record or record of immunization of measles immunity. If there is no record available, it is recommended to get the measles-mumps-rubella [MMR] vaccination. There are no negative repercussions if you get a 2nd dosage of this vaccine.

New and returning college students, healthcare workers, and international travelers are more susceptible to measles, and it is recommended that they get the vaccine.

The measles outbreak that affected more than 300 000 people, killing more than 6000, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) last year [2019] continues into 2020, albeit slowing.

Since the beginning of the year [2020], 20 475 measles cases and 252 deaths have been reported. The World Health Organization (WHO) says while the overall situation remains serious, the weekly incidence of cases and deaths has continued to reduce in the past 10 weeks.

Children under the age of 5 years remain the most affected in all provinces, accounting for 71% of all confirmed cases.

Reactive vaccination campaigns have reached 5 789 008 children aged 6-59 months in 179/261 health zones. In addition, 18 million children aged 6-59 months have been vaccinated in supplementary vaccination activities.

WHO [cautions against complacency] as multiple operational challenges confound the ongoing response: mobilization of resources, issues around provision of free medical care in affected areas, and communication issues.
