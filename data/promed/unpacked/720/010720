total of 33 outbreaks have been detected. Surveillance measures continue to
be implemented in the outbreaks region.
Disease measures have been adopted in order to contain the spread of the
disease. These include the following:
- Ban on 812 establishments.
- Ban on the municipalities of Eldorado, Mundo Novo, Japora and areas in
the municipalities of Iguatemi and Itaquirai situated within a 25-km radius
of the outbreaks.
- 14 permanently manned control posts and application of biosecurity
measures, with entry restricted to professionals and officials working on
the case.
- Clinical inspection of animals in the establishments under surveillance.
- Slaughter of 30 735 susceptible animals, currently in the final phase.
- Compensation payments totaling BRL 12 440 102 (approximately USD 5 354
000) have been paid to 252 producers whose herds were destroyed.
- Cleaning and disinfection; all establishments where depopulation is
complete are being maintained empty.
- Dispatch of a report to all Brazilian states and to the establishments
that received animals from any of the municipalities that were subsequently
placed under a ban on the animal movements that occurred during the 60 days
prior to notification of the 1st outbreak.
- Epidemiological investigation to establish the origin of the disease.
2. State of Parana:

[There is obviously a different set of disease control tactics in play in
the 2 Brazilian states. Mato Grosso do Sul's more aggressive approach will
likely yield better results. A considerable amount of legal wrangling may
contribute to the adoption of different tactics between Mato Grosso do Sul
and Parana; see references. However, such individualized approaches will
not do much to promote international acceptance of the adequacy of the
control measures. Regionalization is a well accepted and useful principle
in disease control and international trade, but this situation appears to
be one of individualization of disease control measures. - Mod.PC]
