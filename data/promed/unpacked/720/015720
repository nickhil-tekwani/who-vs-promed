FMD in Bulgaria: new outbreak, urgent fax
-----------------------------------------
Fax from Dr Damyan Iliev, CVO of the Bulgarian Food Safety Authority
(BVSA) 531-E/19.03.2011:

On 18 Mar 2011, clinical signs suggesting FMD were detected in the
Sedert municipality, at a distance of 42 km [26 mi] from the last
outbreak in Gramatikovo [Burgas]. Salivation and lesions up to 4-5
days old were observed on the mouth and feet. FMD was confirmed by the
National Reference Laboratory on 19 Mar 2011 (PCR positive, ELISA
antibody negative). The infected farm is located in the west part of
Strandja Mountain, municipality of Sedert, at a distance of 7 km [4.4
mi] from the Turkish border.

[Additional information in the fax had been included in the OIE
notification; see ProMED-mail 20110322.0900. - Mod.AS]

(Tables with quantitative data on the susceptible animals in the 2
villages in the 3-km [2 mi] protection zone and 7 villages in the
10-km [6 mi] surveillance zone are included).

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Bulgaria's faxes to the EC on the FMD events provide detailed
description of the observed clinical signs, additional to the
information included in the OIE official reports (see also item 2 in
ProMED-mail 20110120.0236). The appearance of clear, acute disease
signs in apparently unvaccinated, susceptible animals at a distance of
42 km (26 mi) from the closest previous Bulgarian outbreak, and the
proximity to the Turkish border, are supportive of Bulgaria's previous
suspicion on the Turkish origin of the virus and the possible
involvement of wildlife (boars); see also Mod MHJ commentary in
ProMED-mail 20110321.0888. Other scenarios (such as, introduction by
fomites/human traffic), though probably less plausible, remain to be
excluded.

The close relatedness of the Bulgarian strain to Turkish 2010
FMDV-serotype O strain 'PanAsia-2ANT-10' (topotype ME-SA), can be seen
in the WRLFMD genotyping report at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00009%20O%20Bulgaria%202011.pdf>.

The apparent continued circulation of the virus, more than 7 weeks
after the previous outbreak, is of concern. Has surveillance in
Turkish Thrace, particularly involving small ruminants and wild boars,
been undertaken? - Mod.AS]
