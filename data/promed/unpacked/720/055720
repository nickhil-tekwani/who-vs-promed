Bird flu continues to be feared, now affecting a chicken farm near the village Balabancik, Mudanya district, Bursa province.

Last month [May 2015] in Balikesir [province]'s Bandirma district, the bird flu appeared in some poultry farms in Edincik; this time in Bursa. It appeared at a chicken farm near Mudanya District's Balabancik Village. Due to illness with the death of an average of 1000-1500 animals per day in a few days, the Agriculture and Livestock Directorate was informed. Because of similarities to the avian flu, Provincial Directorate has culled 120 000 animals on the farm.

Bird flu has been suspected in 2 Syrian children presented to the Adiyaman Training and Research Hospital; the suspicion has not been confirmed by tests of their blood samples. The children belong to families working on poultry farms. The tests have been [done] in the reference laboratory in Ankara [Turkey].

[In case the media-reported new HPAI H5N1 outbreak is confirmed, Bursa -- its location -- is to become Turkey's 4th HPAI-affected province, following Kastamonu (where the outbreak reportedly started 24 Apr 2015), Balikesir (28 Apr 2015) and Manisa (14 May 2015). The 3 said outbreaks are presented in the interactive map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17641.

5 follow-up reports have been submitted so far to the OIE, the last one on 29 May 2015.

Adiyaman province, where human cases were suspected and not confirmed, is situated in south-central Turkey (map at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C4%B1yaman_Province#/media/File:Adiyaman_in_Turkey.svg). - Mod.AS

We wait for confirmation of etiology in lab tests. With the increase in deaths in poultry in Bursa, and the fact the children lived on a poultry farm, these cases fit the pattern of spillover of avian flu to humans, but needs laboratory testing for confirmation, which appears to be under way. - Mod.LK
