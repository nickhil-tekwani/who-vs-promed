[1] AstraZeneca vaccine trial resumes in UK
Date: Tue 15 Sep 2020 08:44 AM EDT

The Food and Drug Administration is weighing whether to follow British regulators in resuming a coronavirus vaccine trial that was halted when a participant suffered spinal cord damage, even as the National Institutes of Health has launched an investigation of the case. "The highest levels of NIH are very concerned," said Dr Avindra Nath, intramural clinical director and a leader of viral research at the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, an NIH division. "Everyone's hopes are on a vaccine, and if you have a major complication the whole thing could get derailed."

A great deal of uncertainty remains about what happened to the unnamed patient, to the frustration of those avidly following the progress of vaccine testing. AstraZeneca, which is running the global trial of the vaccine it produced with Oxford University, said the trial volunteer recovered from a severe inflammation of the spinal cord and is no longer hospitalized. AstraZeneca has not confirmed that the patient was afflicted with transverse myelitis, but Nath and another neurologist said they understood this to be the case. Transverse myelitis produces a set of symptoms involving inflammation along the spinal cord that can cause pain, muscle weakness, and paralysis. Britain's regulatory body, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, reviewed the case and has allowed the trial to resume in the United Kingdom.

AstraZeneca "need[s] to be more forthcoming with a potential complication of a vaccine which will eventually be given to millions of people," said Nath. "We would like to see how we can help, but the lack of information makes it difficult to do so." Any decision about whether to continue the trial is complex because it's difficult to assess the cause of a rare injury that occurs during a vaccine trial -- and because scientists and authorities have to weigh the risk of uncommon side effects against a vaccine that might curb the pandemic. "So many factors go into these decisions," Nath said. "I'm sure everything is on the table. The last thing you want to do is hurt healthy people."

The NIH has yet to get tissue or blood samples from the British patient, and its investigation is "in the planning stages," Nath said. US scientists could look at samples from other vaccinated patients to see whether any of the antibodies they generated in response to the coronavirus also attack brain or spinal cord tissue. Such studies might take a month or 2, he said. The FDA declined to comment on how long it would take before it decides whether to move forward.

Dr Jesse Goodman, a Georgetown University professor and physician who was chief scientist and lead vaccine regulator at the FDA during the Obama administration, said the agency will review the data and possibly consult with British regulators before allowing resumption of the US study, which had just begun when the injury was reported. 2 other coronavirus vaccines are also in late-stage trials in the US. If it determines the injury in the British trial was caused by the vaccine, the FDA could pause the trial. If it allows it to resume, regulators and scientists surely will be on the watch for similar symptoms in other trial participants.

A volunteer in an earlier phase of the AstraZeneca trial experienced a similar side effect, but investigators discovered she had multiple sclerosis that was unrelated to the vaccination, according to Dr Elliot Frohman, director of the Multiple Sclerosis & Neuroimmunology Center at the University of Texas.

Neurologists who study illnesses like transverse myelitis say they are rare -- occurring at a rate of perhaps 1 in 250 000 people -- and strike most often as a result of the body's immune response to a virus. Less frequently, such episodes have also been linked to vaccines. The precise cause of the disease is key to the decision by authorities whether to resume the trial. Sometimes an underlying medical condition is "unmasked" by a person's immune response to the vaccine, leading to illness, as happened with the MS patient. In that case, the trial might be continued without fear, because the illness was not specific to the vaccine.

More worrisome is a phenomenon called "molecular mimicry." In such cases, some small piece of the vaccine may be similar to tissue in the brain or spinal cord, resulting in an immune attack on that tissue in response to a vaccine component. Should that be the case, another occurrence of transverse myelitis would be likely if the trial resumed, said Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. A 2nd case would shut down the trial, he said.

If the AstraZeneca vaccine fails, the US government is supporting 6 other COVID vaccines in the hope at least one will succeed. The potential problems with the AstraZeneca vaccine show this to be a wise investment, [Dr Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security] said.

[See STAT News (https://www.statnews.com/2020/09/11/ethics-halting-vaccine-trial-pandemic-conversation-ruth-faden/) 11 Sep 2020. The ethics of pausing a vaccine trial in the midst of a pandemic: a conversation with Ruth Faden Byline: Patrick Skerrett @PJSkerrett, for a discussion on the ethics of vaccine trials.

In these politically charged times, and in the competitive environment surrounding this race to a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, it was noteworthy that AstraZeneca suspended its clinical trial after an adverse event. While it is not unusual for a pause to occur in large clinical trials, there is so much attention being focused on vaccine development during this pandemic, it is a difficult decision to stop.

But now the coronavirus vaccine trial has resumed in the UK with little explanation of what about the patient led to starting up again. This does not build confidence in the population who feel vaccine hesitancy. With 6 vaccines in trial in the US, another adverse event is likely to occur. It is important that all the groups in clinical trials display transparency. The public is watching closely, and it is imperative that trust be built. - Mod.LK]

[2] Where is transmission occurring?
Date: Tue 15 Sep 2020 9:25 AM EDT
Source: Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/09/15/covid-transmission-local-strategy/


An increasing number of documented novel coronavirus outbreaks have helped us understand when, where, how, and why this disease is spreading. At a wedding in Jordan in March [2020], the father of the bride, who had fever and cough a few days before the event, greeted his guests with hugs, cheek-kisses, and handshakes. In the process, he unknowingly infected 76 of the 360 attendees. In China, a Buddhist -- who was infected but had no symptoms at the time -- rode to a religious event with their congregation on a bus where the air was recirculated but not exchanged. Over 1/3 of the passengers on the bus were infected, though only one person sitting next to a window developed the disease, COVID-19. In a restaurant in China, 3 families sitting across from an air conditioner were infected, while others sitting to the side of it were not.

With transmission, the devil is often in the details. If the father at the wedding had been a guest rather than the host, would that outbreak have occurred? If the bus had better ventilation, would that outbreak have been averted? If the air conditioning in the restaurant had been off, might some of those families been spared infection? Understanding the granular details of each outbreak by conducting an "epidemiological autopsy" for all confirmed cases is critical to begin characterizing and categorizing where and why transmission is happening. This information can then, in real-time and on an ongoing basis, be used to adjust our strategy and refine our response.

We now know several ways to prevent COVID-19's spread, including wearing masks, physical distancing, testing and isolating people who may have been exposed or have symptoms, and avoiding settings that are indoors, poorly ventilated, or crowded. If most people did most of these things most of the time, we would have vastly fewer cases and probably enough reduction in transmission for the epidemic to die out.

But that is not what is happening. Transmission continues to plateau, wax, wane, and periodically resurge. Part of the reason is that officials and public health experts continue to lack enough real-time data on where, why, how, and to whom transmission is happening. Instead, we make assumptions based on a trickle of journal articles and media reports which, for all we know, may describe incidents that are the exception rather than representative of most of the virus's spread. And we're left repeating blanket messages to double down on the preventive measures we know work and sometimes speculatively suggest new ones -- such as having people talk less in public, wear better masks, or open more windows -- that should reduce the chance of transmission, but without knowing if these interventions address the actual reasons the virus is still spreading.

Investigating where and why each case happened would help to understand where the public health system's gaps are and what we need to do better or differently. Are most cases propagating from a few "superspreading" scenarios in places such as nursing homes and jails? Or are cases happening randomly in the community? Are cases in a town happening in a particular store, or just from a particular person? We also need to know how transmission is happening. Is it bad ventilation? Poor hygiene? Improper mask use? Lack of distancing? Do we need better masks? Or is there something else? There's also the question of who. Are cases mostly among essential workers? If so, which particular types of workers seem to be most affected?

The answers to these questions and others lead to dramatically different conclusions on the corrective actions needed to prevent further spread -- and they can change the strategy applied in each community. All epidemics are fundamentally local and driven by site-specific issues, such as types of essential work, transportation, and density of housing. The reasons transmission thrives in one area may be different from why it persists in another. And even in the same location, what drove the spread of the virus in, say, April [2020] may be very different from what is causing it now.

We used this approach effectively in the West African Ebola epidemic, which one of us worked to fight. Once blanket measures -- such as community engagement, promotion of preventive tactics, burying the dead safely, and contact tracing -- were in place, we analyzed every new infection to understand where and why it happened and then used that information to improve our response and push transmission rates down even more. For example, in one of the last places with Ebola cases, many new infections were caused by bodies of deceased Ebola-infected people not being buried safely. Our knee-jerk assumption was that communities that earlier in the epidemic had been resistant to changing the way they buried their dead were still reluctant. But when we looked closer, we realized that communities were, in fact, calling for assistance for safe burials, but the teams we organized as part of the response were reaching them many hours later. The problem wasn't convincing communities to follow safe burial practices; they were already on board. What we needed was more burial teams, with dedicated vehicles ready to respond promptly to calls. We set that up and immediately saw transmission decline further.

We need to use the same approach to counter COVID-19 and use this data to tighten gaps in our response and adjust our strategy. It can also help us guide messaging so the public understands how to avoid transmission. Most people want to do whatever it takes to protect themselves and their loved ones. Rather than just repeating slogans like "six feet apart" or "mask up," officials and public health experts should provide people with tangible examples of how transmission is happening that they can use to understand how to adjust their habits. Stories based on actual instances of transmission would probably stick more than numbers, charts, or generic slogans, and provide more accurate insights than the hearsay or exceptional outliers that end up filling the vacuum of information.

Insights on why transmission is persisting can underscore where different tactics may be needed. For example, if spread is mostly happening among essential workers, we then need to focus efforts on providing them with personal protective equipment, making it possible for them to stay home without losing income, or similar measures. If transmission is persisting among undocumented groups, we need to then consider how to engage them in ways that build trust and assure them that getting tested or seeking care will not cause problems related to their immigration status.

These data can help identify the subsets of the population who are most affected in each region or city and should be prioritized by health officials for further intervention. For example, if the rapid antigen tests now becoming available could be targeted to the groups or settings driving most new cases, they could help reduce transmission below the threshold of each infected person infecting one additional person needed to shrink the epidemic even potentially without deploying daily population-wide testing. This will also be important for eventual vaccine deployment. If transmission is primarily mediated by particular subsets of the population, "herd immunity" with vaccination will only work if sufficient coverage is achieved within these groups.

In recent weeks, some health departments have begun listing tallies of where cases likely occurred, but this data needs to go a step further and also try to discern why transmission happened despite attempts to reduce spread. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issues investigation reports, but these are typically published months later, only cover a few outbreaks, and they appear to be at risk of tampering by Trump administration officials.

Even if the final product isn't as exhaustive as the CDC's reports, this type of investigation needs to be done for every case in real-time so the results can immediately feed into location-specific adjustments in responding to the virus. Newly diagnosed people are already supposed to be interviewed in this manner as part of contact tracing efforts that have not been keeping pace with cases in some states. We need more people trained to carry out these investigations, and hospitals should also integrate them into the routine intake when COVID-19 patients are admitted.

Because the coronavirus spreads invisibly through the air, and often asymptomatically, it may not be possible to clearly establish the where and why in all cases. But for many, clear exposures can be identified, such as being at a crowded house party, working in a food-processing plant, or living with other people with confirmed infections. In aggregate, these investigations can paint a narrative of transmission in each area and what needs to happen to reduce it.

We are at a crucial juncture in responding to this epidemic as winter is approaching. While we need to redouble our efforts on all fronts, a clearer view of where and why COVID-19 is spreading would go a long way toward fighting the virus.

[In reading this I was trying to find phrases I could delete to shorten the article for this report but it is so well written and takes into account the realities of epidemic transmission that I decided to include the full piece. We need more information and more data to understand where transmission is occurring, but we also need more information to develop targeted messages for known high risk behavior populations. I read between the lines and what I also see is a call for bringing in the medical anthropologists to help find the messages that will get through to the various populations in the country. A key population in mind right now is the college students. They are at an age that is invincible, enjoys breaking rules that aren't life threatening, and it is party time between study and class times. So how do you convince them that breaking simple rules like mask wearing and social distancing is potentially life threatening? And other groups such as joggers and bikers... and then bar goers... - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 14 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept15_1600199290.pdf

- The Americas region reported 37.2% of daily case numbers and 41.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 14.9 million cases. The USA is dominant, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 13.3% of daily case numbers and 11.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.8 million. Countries not reporting to WHO today (15 Sep 2020) include Spain, Israel, Belgium, and Sweden. France is dominant, followed by Russia, Ukraine, the UK, Turkey, and Germany.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.9% of daily case numbers and 9.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.1 million cases. Iraq dominates, followed by Iran, Morocco, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority, the UAE, Tunisia, and Libya.

- The African region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 2.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. South Africa still dominates although daily case counts have fallen below 1000, followed by Algeria, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Uganda, and Zambia.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.3% of daily case numbers and 6.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.55 million cases. The Philippines dominate, followed by Japan, and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 38.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 28.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 5.5 million cases. India dominates followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Europe is experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period. Today, the Western Pacific reported more newly confirmed cases and deaths than the African region, and the South East Asia region reported more cases than the Americas region. Following the daily reports one sees a clear pattern that weekend artifact lasts through Mondays and Tuesdays and the high reporting days seem to be Thursdays and Fridays.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (91 120), followed by the USA (38 858), and Brazil (34 755) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 57.8% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6474 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (14-15 Sep 2020). The USA has now reported a total of 200 197 deaths due to COVID-19.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (11 892), Spain (9437), France (7852), Colombia (6698), and Russia (5529), and 30 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 7 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region and 6 are from the Americas region. Argentina reported the 4th highest daily cases globally today and Spain followed Argentina.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.0%.

Impression: Transmission continues globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission in many countries. Cases seem to be markedly decreasing in South Africa and Brazil, is this a prolonged weekend artifact or is this a real downward trend? - Mod.MPP]
