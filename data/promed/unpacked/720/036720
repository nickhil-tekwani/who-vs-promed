According to the World Health Organization, from January to 30 Sep 2022, a total of 9850 suspected measles cases, including 5806 confirmed and 56 deaths (CFR 0.6%) have been reported in Ethiopia.

A total of 16 districts (woredas) are currently experiencing confirmed measles outbreaks: Chilga; Anded; Gololcha; Gura Damole; Guchi; Babile; Deraa; Banat Semay; North Ari; Raaso; West Imey; Harawo; Jigjiga City; Gashamo; Gorabaqasa; and Afdem.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air by direct contact with infectious droplets or by airborne spread when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. The measles virus can live for up to 2 hours in an airspace after an infected person leaves an area.

People can spread measles up to 4 days before and 4 days after a rash.

Signs and symptoms of measles include maculopapular rash, high fever, a cough, runny nose, or red, watery eyes.

Measles can be severe in all age groups and can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia (infection of the lungs) and death. Several groups are more likely to suffer from measles complications, including children younger than five years of age, adults older than 20 years of age, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia or HIV infection.

[20 Sep 2022, Tigray: War in Tigray has led to "power outages that have disrupted vaccine cold chains, and the inability of people in rural areas to reach health facilities.

"A ceasefire between March and late August [2022] between Tigrayan and federal forces allowed in a trickle of medical aid, but humanitarian access has been suspended since fighting resumed, a U.N. commission of human rights experts said."

As a result:
- Only a trickle of aid entered Tigray during the ceasefire
- Vaccination rates fall from over 90% before the war to under 10% now
- Measles outbreaks were reported in 10 of 35 districts

Deadly diseases such as measles, tetanus, and whooping cough are on the rise in Ethiopia's Tigray region after vaccination rates plunged during the civil war that broke out nearly 2 years ago, doctors and regional health officials say.

The percentage of children in Tigray receiving routine vaccines has fallen below 10% this year, data from the Tigray Health Bureau shows, undoing years of government efforts to boost immunisation rates."

"Ethiopia's health minister Lia said 860 000 doses of measles vaccines were delivered to Tigray last December and additional doses were delivered on 2 Apr 2022.

"Another planned delivery is on hold at the instruction of the UN World Food Progamme, which coordinates humanitarian deliveries into Tigray, Lia said in a statement to Reuters."

Tigray is the 5th-largest by area, the 5th-most populous, and the 5th-most densely populated of the 11 regional states in Ethiopia. The war has created a dire situation jeopardizing the well-being of children. In addition to not being vaccinated against measles, children are also missing out on immunization against diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis B, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib). The vaccination rate for this pentavalent vaccine dropped from 99.3% in 2020 to 36% in 2021 and 7% this year (2022). There is a dangerous shortage of vaccines, medicines and equipment. The fighting makes it extremely difficult to get supplies into the areas that need them. A peaceful solution to the 2 year-long conflict must be found. - Mod.LK
