Veterinary inspectors in the Lyubomlskogo region, Volyn province [northwest Ukraine, bordering Poland; see http://tinyurl.com/d5es9m6] found viral diarrhea of unknown origin affecting cattle; this finding was reported by Peter Nikonchuk, Deputy Chief, State Veterinary Inspector, Lyubomlskogo district.

"This viral diarrhea is of unknown origin, affecting only cattle. Perhaps it is related to weather conditions. The disease broke out on the side of Pribuzhskoye district, and within a few days already has appeared on the opposite side of the region," said P. Nikonchuk.

As stated on the website of the State Veterinary and Phytosanitary Service of Ukraine, according to the Deputy Chief Inspector, the disease has already spread to other neighboring areas: Shatsky and Starovyzhivskom Turiysk. There is ongoing treatment of animals.

"The treatment is being carried out in those villages affected by the disease. The disease lasts 3 or 4 days, so far without recorded deaths of livestock," said P. Nikonchuk.

[The FluTrackers item included the following appreciated comment: "This disease could be anything, incl. Schmallenberg virus [SBV]."

SBV started in the Netherlands in the summer of 2011. Initially (September 2011), the Dutch Animal Health Service in Deventer published a news bulletin addressing: "Reports of cows with watery diarrhea, fever, and declined production." A varying percentage of the cows had watery diarrhea, fever to 41 C, and a substantial loss of production.

July is a month characterised by vectors (including culicoides) activity.

However, scattered cases of diarrhea in cattle can be caused by various agents, infectious and/or toxic, including feed contaminants (e.g. mycotoxins). Complementary information on the issue will be much appreciated, including age and breeds involved, geographic distribution, and any additional clinical and laboratory findings. - Mod.AS
