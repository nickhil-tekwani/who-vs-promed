Additional Measles Cases Confirmed on Maui and Kaua'i
-----------------------------------------------------
The [Hawaii] state Department of Health has confirmed 4 additional cases of measles on Maui and Kaua'i, bringing the total number of confirmed measles cases in these 2 separate clusters in Hawai'i to 7, and the total reported cases for the year [2014] to 9. "These additional cases are an example of how contagious this disease is and how quickly it can spread. However, we also want to reassure the public that the Department of Health (DOH) staff continue to work closely with healthcare providers and facilities as well as CDC's Honolulu Quarantine Station to identify and notify all persons who may have been exposed, to make sure they have appropriate monitoring or treatment as needed," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Y. Park.

"We are asking everyone to check their immunization status and contact their healthcare provider if they need to be vaccinated," said Ronald Balajadia, Immunization Branch chief in a statement. "Although not routinely recommended for children under 12 months of age, infants aged 6-11 months travelling internationally to areas with active measles transmission should be vaccinated. Talk to your child's doctor before you travel."

The state Department of Health says the symptoms of measles generally begin about 14 days (range 7 to 21 days) after a person is infected and may include the following: blotchy red rash; fever; cough; runny nose; red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis); and feeling run down, achy (malaise). Another characteristic symptom is Koplik's spots, which are not always present, but appear as tiny white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth.

Individuals who suspect they have measles should call their doctor right away and isolate themselves from others to help contain the spread of illness, health officials said.

Solomon Islands measles outbreak slowly being brought under control
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in the Solomon Islands say the country's measles outbreak is slowly coming under control. The Director of Maternal and Child Health, Dr Divinal Ogaoga, says the outbreak has been slowed by vaccinations, particularly in the capital Honiara.

"This is the result of the mass measles campaign that was carried out lately, And we have completed Honiara and now the provinces are close to finishing. Most provinces will probably finish at the end of this month [October 2014] but some of the provinces will continue until mid-November [2014]."

Davinal Ogaoga says the outbreak has claimed 7 lives and infected 4000 people since it began in June [2014].
