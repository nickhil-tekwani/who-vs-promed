The Health Commission of Ningxia has reported a confirmed bubonic plague case in capital Yinchuan, imported from North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The patient, a 55-year-old individual from Ordos, Inner Mongolia, is in critical condition at the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University in Yinchuan.

Related areas and organizations have initiated emergency protocols in accordance with laws and regulations and conducted strict classification and prevention and control measures on related areas and personnel. The Ningxia regional government initiated the level IV emergency response on plague prevention and control, demanding all efforts in rescuing the patient and the implementation of comprehensive prevention and control measures, so that the plague will not spread.

[Plague is caused by _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated or sometimes without having a preceding bubo, plague bacteria can invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. A quarantine would be required with contact tracing and even prophylactic antimicrobials if the index case or cases actually had plague pneumonia.

Plague is endemic in parts of China and Mongolia. Marmots such as the tarvaga, Tarbagan, or Mongolian marmot, _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot comes from French marmotte, from Latin _mures monti_ "mountain mouse."

While foodborne transmission of _Y. pestis_ has been described [see citation below], it is far more likely that the bubonic plague cases were acquired via the bites of infected fleas. - Mod.LL]

[Ningxia, officially the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is an autonomous region in the northwest of the People's Republic of China, bordered on the north by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; its provincial capital is Yinchuan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningxia). - Mod.ML
