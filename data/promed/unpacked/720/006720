S. Korea Downplays Disease Concern
-----------------------------------
Seoul: South Korea -- hit by a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak -- on Friday
sought to allay Japanese concerns about the possible spread of the
livestock illness during the World Cup soccer finals, which will be
co-hosted by the two countries.

"Japan's concerns seem groundless as the contaminated area is far from the
World Cup venues, and people are barred from entering the area," said Kang
Dae-jin, an official at the Agriculture Ministry in Seoul.

An outbreak of the deadly livestock disease last week killed hundreds of
pigs at two farms about 100 kilometers (60 miles) south of Seoul, the South
Korean capital.

On Thursday, Japan's Agriculture Ministry said it was concerned about the
possible spread of the disease during the 31 May-30 Jun soccer tournament.
Tens of thousands of soccer fans are expected to travel between the two
countries during the World Cup, raising worries in Japan that the disease
will be transmitted via food or tracked in on shoes.

South Korea's Agriculture Ministry said Friday it was investigating another
suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease in one pig at a farm two
kilometers(1.2 miles) from Ansung, where the outbreak of the disease was
first discovered last week. The World Cup cities nearest to Ansung are
Suwon, 40 kilometers (24 miles) to the north, and Daejeon, 80 kilometers
(50 miles) to the south.

The South Korean government has imposed restrictions on the transport of
livestock. It has slaughtered 11 965 pigs and 41 cows as a protective
measure, and two-thirds of the nation's 106 livestock markets have closed
to prevent the spread of the disease.

Foot-and-mouth disease spreads rapidly among cloven-hoofed animals such as
cows and pigs, but is not dangerous to humans. Infected animals suffer
blisters on their hooves and in their mouths.

Following the South Korean outbreak, Japan banned the import of pigs and
other livestock and now requires visitors who spent time near contaminated
South Korean farms to disinfect their shoes at ports of entry.

[The concerns of the Japanese authorities remind those of their
counterparts in the Republic of Ireland during the recent FMD outbreak in
the UK which was identified on 21 Feb 2001. On 28 Feb 2001, following the
information on a suspected FMD case in neighbouring Northern Ireland, the
Irish Minister of Agriculture, Mr Joe Walsh TD, published an "immediate
call to all sporting bodies to postpone events or where this is not
possible to ensure that protective measures are in place so that vehicles
and spectators undergo disinfection." Consequently, the Gaelic Athletic
Association (GAA) decided to postpone games over next week-end. Minister
Walsh expressed his appreciation of the decision. - Mod. AS]
