The Centre for Health Protection [CHP] of the Department of Health (DH) today confirmed an imported case of Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] and reminded people to take preventive measures against mosquito-transmitted diseases.

The case involved a 48-year-old man who lived in Chongqing. He developed fever and confusion in Chongqing on 2 Aug [2012]. He arrived in Hong Kong on 8 Aug [2012] and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of North District Hospital on the same day. Blood test results showed that he tested positive for the disease [virus or antibody], which is usually transmitted by the bite of infective [_Culex_] mosquitoes. The man died on 16 Aug [2012].

This is the 2nd case reported to the CHP this year. One case was reported in 2011. No cases were reported from 2008 to 2010.

[Eastern China is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). It is transmitted by several species of _Culex_ mosquitoes. Wild birds (especially ardeids) are the vertebrate hosts of JEV. Although Hong Kong is well within the geographic distribution of JE virus, this is clearly an imported case from Chongqing, some 1115 km (693 mi) distant from Hong Kong. ProMED-mail archive no. 20040623.1672 indicated that from 1992 to 2003, there have been 7 sporadic cases of JE reported in Hong Kong, including one local case in 1996, one imported case in 1997, one imported case in 2001, 2 imported cases in 2002, and one local case in 2003, 2004 and 2011.
