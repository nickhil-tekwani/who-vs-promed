A 51 year old woman, resident of the isolated Ayacara locality (80 kilometers [50 mi] north east of Chait√©n), became unwell and was diagnosed with a hantavirus. The health SEREMI [Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; regional health ministerial secretariat], of Los Lagos [region] stated that "A rapid test gave positive results. The progression of her respiratory failure was very rapid and led to acute respiratory insufficiency for which she had to be immediately transferred [from Puerto Montt] to the Tumaco Hospital," where she was connected to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) equipment.

The patient remains in a "very critical condition", receiving intensive treatment and connected to ECMO equipment said the Los Lagos Health SEREMI Carlos Becerra. Becerra announced that a team from the Zoonosis Unit of the Los Lagos SEREMI traveled to the place of the affected woman's residence to investigate the case.

[Severe cases of hantavirus infections occur in the Los Lagos region occasionally and in Chile every year. Earlier this year (16 Jan 2022) a health authority confirmed the death of a man who was rapid test positive for a hantavirus infection from Majllin in the Los Lagos region. The patient was also hospitalized in the Tamuco hospital (see Hantavirus - Americas (04): Chile (LG, NB) 20220121.8700987). Although not specified in these or previous reports from the regions, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur there every year. Andes virus can be transmitted directly person to person but only with very close physical proximity, usually within the family. However, unless specific laboratory tests are done, Seoul hantavirus cannot be ruled out.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
