[This has been an active year in the northern hemisphere for eastern
equine encephalitis in horses. EEE was also reported frequently by
Canada in 2008, with a total of 14 outbreaks. Reports from Central
and South America tend to be less frequent, as different viral
subtypes exist for different parts of the Americas. If you want to
understand how these differences in viral varieties play out
geographically and epidemiologically, I urge you to read Charlie
Calisher's cogent and incisive comments in our archive postings. See
