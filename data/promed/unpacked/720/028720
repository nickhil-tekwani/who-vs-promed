A shoreline veterinarian is putting out a warning after she said 2 dogs that she treats were rushed to animal hospitals in the last 5 days for likely ingesting marijuana.

John Bruno said he took his almost-2-year-old dog, Jodi, on her regular 3-mile walk in Old Saybrook and to his neighbor's house, which was nothing out of the ordinary. But Monday night [18 Feb 2019] he had to rush her to the Pieper Veterinary Madison's emergency center.

"She was very lethargic, and it was almost like [she was] having a seizure. It seemed like she had [suffered] a stroke, and it scared the daylights out of me," Bruno said.

Usually Jodi is an active dog.

"She was twitching, and she'd jump, and she was very nervous. The vet looked at her and said it could be something neurological, but 'I'm willing to bet, I'm 98% sure that she ingested marijuana,'" Bruno said.

Bruno had no idea where Jodi found it.

Pieper Veterinary marketing manager Jesse Ferguson confirmed the center did see a dog having ingested marijuana.

Jodi's regular vet, Dr. Kathy Clark of Clark Veterinary Hospital in Old Lyme, has the paperwork and has confirmed it as well.

Clark said 2 of her 4-legged canine patients were rushed to animal hospitals for likely marijuana ingestion over the past 5 days after being out for a walk. The other dog was walking in Niantic, Clark said.

"It's suggesting we are going to see more problems where marijuana's available fairly close," Clark said, adding she's seen more cases since medicinal marijuana was legalized in Connecticut.

Clark also said both young dogs had signs come on very quickly, and it's important to keep a closer eye on your pup.

"If they're really sniffing something under the bench, pull them out because there may be something in there they shouldn't be getting into," Clark said.

It's something Bruno is already aware of but said he's going to pay extra close attention to.

"It was painful just watching her trembling, having these tremors, just not being herself," he said.

Jodi is about 80% back to her normal behaviors.

Dr. Carol Himsel, an emergency and critical care doctor at Pieper Veterinary Madison, said about once a week their doctors do see cases of dogs ingesting marijuana. Before medicinal marijuana became legal in Connecticut, that number was around once a month, she said.

Signs for a dog could include sudden incoordination and stumbling, tremors, potential reaction to sounds and light, and dilated pupils; in addition, dogs often vomit because THC is powerful in dogs, according to Himsel.

The Pet Poison Helpline said in the last 6 years, Pet Poison Helpline experienced a 448% increase in marijuana cases. For more information, see https://www.petpoisonhelpline.com/pet-safety-tips/marijuana-toxicity-pets/.

[Although a pet could show signs of marijuana toxicity post-inhalation, the majority of cases usually are due to suspected or known oral ingestion. While dogs are more often involved in this toxicity, cats can also be poisoned with marijuana. A 2002 study of 250 cases of marijuana exposure showed dogs to be the primary cannabis consumption culprits (96%). Cats followed in a distant 2nd place (3%), and other species made up the smallest portion (1%) (ref 1).

Mild cases present with lethargy, altered response to visual or verbal stimuli, injected (blood-engorged) conjunctiva, and behavior changes.

More severe cases display ataxia, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, ptyalism, emesis, anorexia, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, and dysphoria (vocalization). Coma and death are also possible in severe cases.

Clinical signs can occur within minutes to hours and can last for hours to days, in part due to body-fat storage of the active ingredients in marijuana.

A 2004 study of 213 dogs with oral marijuana exposure showed neurologic signs (lethargy, ataxia, dilated pupils, etc.) in 99% of patients. Gastrointestinal signs, such as vomiting, were seen in 30% of patients (ref 2).

Although marijuana can have an anti-nausea effect, the volume consumed in proportion to the patient's body weight, other ingested ingredients, and the induced release of "feel-good" hormones like serotonin can cause vomiting.

Marijuana contains delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which causes the release of neurotransmitters acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain's frontal cortex and cerebellum. The increased release of these neurotransmitters leads to the various clinical manifestations.

Cannabis toxicity has a variety of differential diagnoses. Options include stimulants (ephedrine and ephedrine-like compounds, amphetamines, nicotine, and methylxanthines found in chocolate), opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, amitraz (such as that used in anti-parasitic collars), ivermectin (from heartworm preventives), bromethalin (rodenticides), ethylene glycol (antifreeze), and alcohol (ethanol from rotting fruit, bread dough, etc.).

The diagnosis, however, may not necessarily be confirmed by the owner, who may be completely unaware a pet was exposed to the drug.

Other owners are up front about their pets' ingestion of cannabis. Most are somewhat reluctant to share the truth, but ultimately concede under gentle, direct questioning, and for the good of their pet.

Besides the effects of THC, "edibles" can contain substances potentially adversely affecting a pet's health. These include carbohydrates, fat, proteins, and other ingredients, such as chocolates or alcohols. Vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, pancreatitis, and other clinical signs can ensue and lead to further complications.

Veterinarians are qualified to handle the effects of marijuana in pets, whether treating a toxicity, often brought on by the owner, or treating the animal therapeutically. Colorado State University has and is conducting some extremely beneficial studies to understand dosages in canines and uses for the therapy. This work will soon be reported and will give veterinarians a better understanding of using this drug therapeutically. As pointed out in the article, CBD [cannabidiol] seems to be more useful in pets than THC [tetrahydrocannabinol]. I would hope the FDA would not throw out a useful treatment, especially for some neurological conditions, just because people want to try and get their pets high. - Mod.TG
