Summary
-------
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Belgian cattle population after the 1st period of infection of the emerging Schmallenberg virus [SBV]. A total number of 11 635 cattle from 422 herds sampled between 2 Jan and 7 Mar 2012 were tested for the presence of SBV-specific antibodies using an ELISA kit.

Between-herd seroprevalence in cattle was estimated at 99.76 percent (95 percent CI: 98.34-99.97) and within-herd seroprevalence at 86.3 percent (95 percent CI: 84.75-87.71). An intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.3 (P less than 0.001) was found, indicating that the correlation between 2 animals within a herd with respect to their serological status was high. Those results corroborate the conclusion that the SBV was widespread in Belgium during winter 2011.

Seroprevalence was shown to be statistically associated to the animal's age (P less than 0.0001): with 64.9 percent (95 percent CI: 61.34-68.3) estimated for the 6-12 months of age, 86.79 percent (95 percent CI: 84.43-88.85) for the 12-24 months of age, and 94.4 percent (95 percent CI: 93.14-95.44) for the animals older than 24 months.

Based on the results of the described serological survey, we can conclude that after the 1st SBV episode, almost every Belgian cattle has already been in contact with the virus. In consequence, the vast majority of the host animals should have developed post infection protective immunity against the virus.

[Subscribers are referred to the full paper, which includes 2 maps and a histogram (subscription required). The following comment, from the discussion passage, merits attention:

"It is worth noticing that in the south eastern part of Belgium, the level of infection was relatively lower. Interestingly, the same pattern has been detected in the sheep population (Meroc et al, submitted). This underlines the need to keep watch over this area in the following months since this host population seems to be immunized to a slightly lesser extent than the rest of the population. This part of Belgium, called 'the Belgian Ardennes', is an upland region covered in dense forests. Landscape elements such as altitude and land cover have been showed in the past to influence the spatial distribution of other _Culicoides_-borne diseases such bluetongue".

It remains to be seen if the forecast of significantly reduced number, or absence, of congenitally malformed offspring in domestic ruminants in Belgium, during the coming months, materialises. If affirmed, vaccination becomes less essential. - Mod.AS

[Ref: Larska M, Polak MP, Grochowska M, et al: First report of Schmallenberg virus infection in cattle and midges in Poland. Transbound Emerg Dis. 2013 Jan; doi: 10.1111/tbed.12057]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Two outbreaks of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection that coincided with the introduction of 2 bulls imported from France into 2 herds located in West Pomerania and Silesia provinces in Poland are described in detail. The 1st SBV real-time RT-PCR-positive result was obtained during routine testing of one of the imported bulls. The 2nd bull and the affected farms were tracked by further investigation. Transmission of SBV into Polish cattle herds where the bulls were imported was confirmed by viral RNA detection in real-time RT-PCR, virus isolation followed by immunoperoxidase (IPX) staining and seroconversion. SBV RNA was detected also in _Culicoides obsoletus_ pools caught in a trap located 5 km [3.1 mi] from one of the outbreaks. Testing of nearly 900 samples collected prior to the 2 outbreaks from the same areas or provinces neighbouring with Germany where SBV cases had previously been detected gave negative results for the presence of SBV or specific antibodies. These cases are the 1st ones detected in cattle in Poland and provide evidence of recent transmission of the pathogen into the country and involvement of midge vectors.

[The following passage has been derived from the discussion chapter:

"None of parous culicoid pools was positive for SBV what could imply that the virus was not replicating yet in the insects. The possibility of transovarial transmission of the virus in the midges described for BTV [bluetongue virus] could explain SBV survival through the winter. However, despite none of the nulliparous pools being positive, the hypothesis of vertical passage in the insects should also be excluded at this stage of testing and will be investigated further.

Limited studies on the SBV incidence in _Culicoides_ spp. in Europe indicate that _C. obsoletus_ is possibly the key species of midges responsible for virus transmission in Europe. The other SBV vector, _C. dewulfi_, is rather rare in Poland.

The 2 French bulls in question as well as all other animals in the herds remained healthy during the observation period; however, the infection coincided with the breeding and the pregnancy period. As described previously for the related Akabane virus, the vulnerable gestation period for foetal infection in cattle starts around a month after conception and lasts until day 174 of pregnancy. Reproduction problems may be expected during the next calving season in the investigated herds. A relatively low proportion of cattle infected in these herds compared to the high seroprevalence in Western Europe and high virus loads in around 16 percent of cattle tested indicate the recent infection, which with the abundance of susceptible _Culicoides_ spp., has a great potential to be further transmitted. Spread of SBV should be expected during the autumn of 2012, because the virus has already penetrated the midge population to the distance of at least 5 km [3.1 mi] from the location of the possible index herd at the end of August 2012.

This is the 1st study on the appearance of SBV in cattle in Poland, based on virus detection, serological response and the presence of SBV in _Culicoides_ trapped in the region where affected animals were identified. The results presented in this study suggest that the transmission of SBV into 2 herds could have coincided with the introduction of the bulls purchased from France in that time period. However, there are insufficient data to establish the exact place and the time of SBV infection of the bulls. Further phylogenetic analysis may explain the source of the infections; however, the number of nucleotide sequences of European SBV isolates available in GenBank is still very limited."
