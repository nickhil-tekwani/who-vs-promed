The Mizoram Health Department will send dog ticks known
as_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_, collected from Mizoram's Thanzamasora
hamlet, to the laboratories of the National Centre for Disease Control
in New Delhi for tests, in view of the deaths of 6 villagers due to
Indian tick typhus.

According to an official statement here, the cause of death of the 6
people at Thanzamasora in Lunglei district during March 2011 was
declared as cerebral malaria, but it was found to be due to a rare
disease known as Indian tick typhus.

The statement said that the blood samples of some patients in
Tnazamasora, showing the same symptoms, were sent to the National
Centre for Disease Control, and the laboratory tests confirmed that
the disease was Indian tick typhus, transmitted by a particular tick
found in rodents and domestic dogs, caused by a bacterium known as
_Rickettsia conorii_.

The disease was detected in 1999 from a French tourist and also among
tea garden workers in Kerala in 2004, the statement added.

[The manifestations of illness in the cases and how many non-fatal
cases occurred are not stated.

The following is part of the case report of the French tourist
mentioned above with a discussion of the Indian tick typhus (ITT)
variant with the citations removed
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no5/parola_letter.htm):

Although ITT was clinically described at the beginning of the
century, the etiologic agent has never been isolated from patients in
India, nor has a case been diagnosed by strain-specific serologic
testing. A spotted fever group rickettsia was isolated in 1950 from a
brown dog tick, _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_, collected in India and
assumed to be the agent causing ITT. It was designated as _Rickettsia
conorii_, the agent of Mediterranean spotted fever , which occurs all
around the Mediterranean and is transmitted by the same tick species.
However, the disease as it appears in India differs from the common
description of Mediterranean spotted fever. The rash is frequently
purpuric, and an inoculation eschar at the bite site is rarely found,
as in this case. The disease as known in India is mild to moderately
severe, although our case may be considered severe.

Strain differences within the species _R. conorii_ may account for
differences in clinical presentation. Although different isolates of
_R. conorii_ can be distinguished antigenically, molecular taxonomic
methods demonstrated recently that these rickettsiae are closely
related and cluster together. Thus, the species is considered by many
as _R. conorii_, including 4 serovars: _R. conorii_ with 3 type
strains, Seven being the one most commonly identified in our
laboratory in isolates from France, Portugal, North Africa (D. Raoult,
unpub. data), Kenya, and Morocco (apparently a unique isolate); _R.
conorii_ Indian tick typhus; _R. conorii_ Astrakhan, and _R. conorii_
Israel.

The brown dog tick, _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ Latreille, is unusual
among ticks in that it can complete its entire life cycle indoors
(http://entomology.ifas.ufl.edu/creatures/urban/medical/brown_dog_tick.htm).
Because of this, it can establish populations in colder climates, and
has been found in much of the world. Many tick species can be carried
indoors on animals, but cannot complete their entire life cycle
inside. Although _R. sanguineus_ will feed on a wide variety of
mammals, dogs are the preferred host in the U.S. and appear to be
required to develop large infestations.

Infestations in houses can explode to very high levels quickly.
Typically, a few ticks are brought into the house or kennel, often on
a dog which has been away from home. The early stages of the
infestation, when only a few individuals are present, are often missed
completely. The 1st indication that the dog owner has that there is a
problem is when they start noticing ticks crawling up the walls or
curtains! - Mod.LL]
