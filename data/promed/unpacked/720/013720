A 14-year-old boy in Mubende district succumbed to a strange disease on Thursday [2 Aug 2018] following a severe headache and vomiting.

According to a press release from ministry of health, 16 suspected similar cases have been reported, with 8 deaths within Kibalinga sub-county.

"There were 7 picked for analysis at the Uganda Virus Research Institute, and 5 patients were isolated in Mubende hospital. Their condition is stable," reads the press release.

Samples sent to the laboratory have all tested negative for the known viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg and yellow fever.

National Health Laboratory Services also tested blood, carried out stool cultures, urine analyses, and other rapid tests, including for malaria and hepatitis B, which have all turned out negative.

Consequently, the Ministry of Health will send some samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborating laboratory in Atlanta, USA.

Nonetheless, the ministry has taken a number of measures to control the spread of the disease such as dispatching a surveillance team to conduct a search for cases and follow them up.

What is more, an isolation facility has been established in Mubende regional referral hospital for close monitoring of suspected cases, while 2 ambulances have been set aside to pick patients from the community. Community sensitization is also taking place.

[Apparently, health authorities consider these to be hemorrhagic fever cases because of the types of tests that have been done, with negative results, although the symptoms mentioned in the above report are of only severe headache and vomiting with no indication of hemorrhagic manifestations. The information provided is too non-specific to speculate on the etiological agent that might be involved.

There have been several instances of undiagnosed hemorrhagic disease in Uganda this year [2018].

ProMED would be interested in receiving additional information about the CDC test results, any other laboratory tests that might have been conducted locally, or details of symptoms and physical findings. - Mod.TY
