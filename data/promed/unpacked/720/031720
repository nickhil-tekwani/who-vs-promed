conorii_ Complex) Associated with Human Disease in Portugal. EID Vol5 No6

An edited abstract follows:
Mediterranean spotted fever is endemic in Portugal, where it is a
reportable disease with approximately 1000 new cases per year. _Rickettsia
conorii_ has been thought to be the only pathogenic rickettsia of the
spotted fever group in Portugal, as well as in the Western Mediterranean
area. Another rickettsia in this group, the Israeli spotted fever
rickettsia, which belongs to the _R. conorii_ complex, was isolated in 1974
from ticks and humans; however, its distribution appeared to be restricted
to Israel. We report 3 cases of rickettsiosis in Portugal caused by Israeli
spotted fever rickettsia.
Rickettsiae were isolated by the shell vial technique from the blood of the
3 patients. Sequences of polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-amplified
fragments of genes of the isolates show 100% similarity with the homologous
sequence of Israeli spotted fever rickettsia.
All 3 patients lived in semi-rural areas, along the River Tejo (Setubal
District). None had left Portugal during the previous year. These findings
indicate that the geographic distribution of Israeli spotted fever is wider
than had been thought and includes the Iberian Peninsula.
Because initial signs and symptoms are particularly uncharacteristic and
appropriate treatment may [therefore] be delayed, this rickettsia can cause
life-threatening disease.
