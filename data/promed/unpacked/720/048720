A virus that makes humans suffer colds is attributed to the death of chimpanzees in Uganda that were killed by a respiratory disease, a US study published [Wed 13 Dec 2017] showed.

Researchers from the US University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) did field studies and were surprised to find that a human "common cold" virus known as rhinovirus C had triggered an outbreak of a respiratory disease in a community of wild chimpanzees in Uganda's Kibale National Park [in western Uganda], which killed healthy chimpanzees.

"It was completely unknown that rhinovirus C could infect anything other than humans," said Tony Goldberg, a professor of the UW School of Veterinary Medicine and one of the senior authors of the study, which was published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases on [Wed 13 Dec 2017].

Goldberg, who has worked in Uganda for years tracking viruses in animals, cited the death of a 2-year-old chimp called Betty as an example, which was killed by the human virus in an outbreak in February 2013 that hit most of the chimpanzees in the community.

The sweeping epidemic killed 5 of the 56 chimpanzees, including Betty, in the community, with the oldest adult animal that fell victim being up to 57 years old, according to the study.

It said the virus was communicated to the apes through human activities, including human settlement expanding to ape habitats, tourism, and research, as well as when apes left the forests for foods.

Rhinovirus C, which has been affecting humans for several thousand years, was rarely found in chimpanzees in the wild in the past. It can cause severe symptoms in people, especially children.

The article states, "Rhinoviruses are antigenically diverse members of the family Picornaviridae, genus _Enterovirus_, that cause the common cold in humans. Rhinovirus C causes an estimated 50 percent of all human upper respiratory tract infections and most acute exacerbations of asthma in children. Epidemics of respiratory disease have been recorded in non-human ape populations across Africa, but the causes have often remained undiagnosed."

This research shows that rhinovirus C can infect non-human primates, and the lethal consequences observed suppose a concern for the conservation of apes. - Mod.PMB
