United States confirms anthrax in Chilean letter 29 Nov 2001
------------------------------------------------------------
[US federal health officials yesterday confirmed the presence of anthrax
in samples Chilean authorities said they had taken from a letter from
Florida. But the anthrax [bacilli were not of the strain that had killed 5
Americans, and were most likely to have originated in Chile, officials
said. In the search for a source, Chilean public health officials said they
had found no traces of anthrax in the offices and other environs of Dr
Antonio Banfi, the pediatrician in Santiago who received the letter 2 weeks
ago. They said they planned to provide American investigators with the
letter, a solicitation from a medical publishing company in Orlando,
Florida, for further analysis.
American law enforcement and health officials had expressed frustration in
recent days that they did not have the letter, but only bacteria grown by
Chilean officials from spores said to be taken from the letter. Because of
that, they said, it was possible that the anthrax came from laboratory
contamination. Chilean public health officials yesterday discounted the
possibility that the letter could have been contaminated in their laboratory.
The letter, carrying a subscription slip for a journal on infectious
disease, did not follow the pattern of the other known tainted mailings
received by 2 senators and Tom Brokaw of NBC News. Those letters were
postmarked in Trenton, had no real return addresses, and were written in
rough block letters. The letter in Chile was sent in a business envelope,
from an actual business, and the address was typed, rather than
handwritten. Also, unlike the others, the letter in Chile did not contain
powder. American and Chilean officials say, as they dig deeper, that
nothing quite adds up.
"There is no doubt about it, the anthrax is confirmed," said Jeanette Vega
Morales, director of the Institute of Public Health, the official Chilean
national disease laboratory that conducted the first tests. She said the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told her yesterday of their test
results.
Dr Banfi, a 56 year old pediatrician, said that on the afternoon of 13 Nov
he received a letter at his clinic that appeared suspicious because of the
strange combination of postal markings. Although the return address was
Orlando, the postmark was Zurich, Switzerland. In fact, the letter was sent
via DHL, which used a Swiss bulk mail shipper in New York and a Swiss
postmark. Dr Banfi said he put the letter unopened in a plastic bag, sealed
the bag with tape, and called the police. The bag was in police custody for
several hours before the police handed it over to the Institute of Public
Health. Ms Vega Morales said the letter was sealed when it arrived at her
offices, and it was immediately taken to a high security laboratory for
testing.
"There's no chance of contamination in the lab," Ms Vega Morales said. "And
we do not believe that the envelope was deliberately contaminated with
anthrax spores in Chile." Ms Morales said the laboratory was outfitted with
air filters and sanitized, compartmentalized work stations and staffed by
technicians who wore protective clothing. She said there had not been a
single accidental contamination in the laboratory where the tests were
performed since it was built in 1997, and that no case of anthrax had been
reported in Santiago since 1994.
No powder was found in the letter, but its insides were swabbed by
technicians reaching into a sanitized cabinet with protective gloves. The
specimen was stored and cultivated in a petri dish, tested positive for
anthrax, and then sent up to the United States for further testing. Ms
Morales said that the disease control centers had said that the strain of
anthrax found in Chile was similar to strains that had been found in
Turkey. She said no contamination had been found in Dr Banfi's office.
Dr Banfi is taking the drug Cipro as a precaution. He has undergone hours
of questioning by the Chilean police about his politics and potential
enemies, but has said that he has neither strong political views nor
enemies. "I'd prefer not to have the world's attention," he said. "I just
want to attend to the children in peace."

Suspected letter's origin
-------------------------------
BERN, Switzerland -- Swiss Federal Police Office said the letter was part
of a large mailing sent on behalf of a Florida company by the New York
branch of the Swiss Post Office. Swiss Post International Inc. provides
worldwide bulk mailing services for companies. Under United States rules,
letters sent within the country by international post offices must carry a
foreign postmark. The letter sent to Chile bore a postmark from Zurich,
Switzerland, but had no date -- typical of letters sent by the New York
branch, Swiss officials said.
On Tuesday, officials at Mosby Inc., a publisher of medical journals, told
the Orlando Sentinel that whoever mailed the letter listed their Orlando,
Florida, headquarters as the return address. Mosby is one of 3 publishing
imprints owned by Harcourt Health Sciences.
[Other reports had this as an ordinary posting under the circumstances of
international bulk mailing, but it was noted that the envelope had 2 naked
windows for the sender and receiver addresses, that is, there was no clear
plastic covering. Thus powder inside the envelope could have fallen out,
and contamination could occur from outside. - Mod.MHJ

[Whatever the reality, Chile does regularly report cases of human cutaneous
anthrax. And from personal experience, laboratory contamination can be
insidious unless there are regular weekly cleaning and disinfection and
surface checks. This thread is now cut. If anything emerges of importance,
it will be posted. - Mod.MHJ
