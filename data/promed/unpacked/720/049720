Fusarium Fruit Rot of Greenhouse Sweet Peppers in Canada.
R. Utkhede and S. Mathur, Pacific Agri-Food Research Centre, Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada, P.O. Box 1000, Agassiz, British Columbia, Canada V0M
1A0. Plant Dis. 87:100, 2003; published on-line as D-2002- 1106-01N, 2002.
Accepted for publication 30 Oct 2002.
In the summer of 2001, a fruit rot of orange sweet peppers (_Capsicum
annum_ L. cv. Sympathy MZ) was observed in commercial greenhouses in
British Columbia, Canada. Approximately 40 percent of fruits in the
commercial greenhouse were severely affected in 2001 and approximately 10
percent in 2002. The disease appeared on mature fruits at harvest time, and
affected fruits are considered culls.
The disease appeared as discolored soft patches or necrotic spots
predominantly at the calyx end and occasionally, anywhere on the mature
fruit at harvest time. Seeds and the surrounding area inside the fruits
were covered with fungal growth and orange-pink spore masses.
5 fungal isolations were made from the lesions. Infected tissues from the
edge of lesions were surface-sterilized in 1 percent hypochlorite for 2
min, blotted dry on sterile filter paper, and cultured on PDA. Plates were
incubated at 22 deg C for 7 days.
Single spore fungal colonies isolated from the tissues yielded only a
_Fusarium_ sp. which was consistently isolated from affected pepper fruits.
Morphology of the fungus was consistent with _Fusarium subglutinans_
(Wollenweber & Reinking) Nelson et al. according to Keith Seifert of
Eastern Cereal and Oilseed Research Centre, Ottawa, Canada. Molecular tests
are being developed to confirm the identification of the fungus.
To confirm pathogenicity, 10 flowers and developing fruits of sweet pepper
cv. Sympathy MZ grown in a greenhouse were inoculated with the pathogen.
For inoculation, 20 microliters of fungal spore suspension (1 million
spores/ml) was drop-inoculated on the wounded and unwounded surfaces of
fruits. Flowers were drop-inoculated in the middle of flowers without any
wounding. Controls were treated with 20 microliters of sterile water. The
experiment was repeated once.
Approximately 80 percent of inoculated fruits and flowers developed
symptoms on fruits similar to naturally infected fruits at maturity. Fruits
from control plants did not develop any disease. On PDA, a _Fusarium_
species identical to the original one was recovered from all inoculated
infected fruits. A preliminary study showed that this pathogen does not
infect other greenhouse crops such as tomato, cucumber, or lettuce.
Sweet pepper stem and fruit rot caused by _Fusarium solani_ has been
reported previously (1) but there is no report of fruit rot caused by a
_Fusarium subglutinans_-like species on greenhouse sweet peppers.

[The taxonomy of _F. subglutinans_ has been recently changed. The new name
is _Fusarium circinatum_. In addition to sweet pepper, the fungus infects
other major food crops (maize and mango) as well as others not monitored by
ProMED-Plant (including pineapple, which is severely affected in Brazil).
Many species of pine are susceptible to pitch canker caused by _F.
circinatum_. - Mod.DH]
