The SA [South Africa] Humans Rights Commission (SAHRC) will on [Thu 8 Nov 2018] conduct a site inspection of Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Coronationville, Johannesburg [Gauteng]. The inspection follows reports of 9 infants dying at the hospital due to a necrotising enterocolitis bacterial outbreak. The condition occurs mostly in premature newborns and affects their intestines.

When news of the outbreak first broke several months ago, it was reported that a probe by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases had failed to establish the origin of the disease.

Ahead of the SAHRC's visit to the hospital on [Thu 8 Nov 2018], TimesLIVE went in search of what people had said about the facility in recent weeks. In a recent social media post, one person tweeted that the Gauteng department of health should perform random visits to the hospital, especially in the evenings. "You really need to do late night shift random visits at Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital and see your nursing staff sleeping and watching soaps while women go through labour on their own and they do not care for anything except their sleep and soapies," wrote the concerned person.

[Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital is located in Coronationville, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahima_Moosa_Mother_and_Child_Hospital). There are 4 general wards of between 20-30 beds each and 2 neonatal wards with 35 beds and an additional 12 beds for "Kangaroo Mother Care" on the in-patient service; there is also a 6-bedded neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and a "high care area" within this unit that has another 4 beds (https://www.wits.ac.za/clinicalmed/departments/paediatrics/hospital-services/rahima-moosa-mother-and-child-hospital/). A map showing the location of Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital can be found at https://www.wits.ac.za/clinicalmed/departments/paediatrics/contact-us/rahima-moosa-mother-and-child-hospital/.

A news report one month ago said that "43 cases [of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) have occurred] between March and July [2018], of which 9 were fatal" and "the outbreak came under control in May [2018] up until the period of August [2018] (https://ewn.co.za/2018/09/30/9-infants-died-at-rahima-moosa-hospital-after-bacterial-outbreak)". Also, "The babies died over a 6-month period at the facility (https://ewn.co.za/2018/10/01/nec-disease-may-have-been-caused-by-underdevelopment-of-infants-guts)."

NEC is ischemic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa that mainly involves the terminal ileum and colon, although the entire gastrointestinal tract is affected in severe cases. Enteric microorganisms invade the bowel wall and produce gas that can dissect into the intestinal wall. Involvement varies from focal mucosal injury to full-thickness bowel necrosis and perforation. The etiology and pathogenesis of NEC remain uncertain.

NEC occurs in up to about 10 percent of usually formula-fed premature infants, especially those weighing less than 1500 g [3 lb, 5 oz] at birth, but is rare in full term infants. Most infants who develop NEC recover, but it can lead to overwhelming sepsis and death in the worst cases. In survivors scarring and narrowing of the bowel may develop and can lead to future intestinal obstruction or malabsorption.

Both sporadic cases and NICU outbreaks have occurred (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11421422). One NEC outbreak was attributed to _Enterobacter sakazakii_, a common contaminant of powdered milk formula (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC87717/). In another NEC outbreak, norovirus appeared to precipitate NEC in predisposed infants (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347608002825). Other viruses implicated in NEC outbreaks have included coronavirus, rotavirus and enterovirus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11421422), and other implicated microorganisms include: _Klebsiella_ (https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(74)80133-2/abstract); "uropathogenic" _E. coli_ (ProMED-mail post Necrotizing enterocolitis: uropathogenic _E. coli_ 20160318.4103727); a novel _Clostridium_ species (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/35/Supplement_1/S101/442896); and _C. difficile_ (http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/71/6/935).
