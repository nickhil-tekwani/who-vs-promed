Nipah encephalitis claimed one more life at Kushtia General Hospital
Sunday morning [13 Feb 2011], raising the death toll to 31. A man aged
30 of Shimulia village in Mirpur upazila of the district was admitted
to the general hospital with high fever Saturday afternoon, reports
our Kushtia correspondent. He died at about 10:00 am Sunday, Dr Taposh
Kumar Pal, resident medical officer of the hospital, said. Family
sources said Fulchand got the fever after he drank date juice on
Friday [11 Feb 2011].

It is the 1st case of Nipah virus encephalitis in Kushtia. 31 people
died from the disease in 7 districts -- Rangpur, Kurigram,
Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Gaibandha, Dinajpur and Kushtia -- since 31
Jan 2011.

[Date palm juice contaminated with Nipah virus is a frequent source
of human infection in Bangladesh, because virus carrying _Pteropus_
fruit bats drink it from the collecting pots on the tree). A low-cost
preventive measure, locally fabricated bamboo skirts around the date
juice collecting pots, has been an effective measure to prevent
contamination of the juice with Nipah virus from fruit bats. Nipah
virus infections in humans are severe, with case fatality rates of
40-75 percent. This report indicates that human Nipah virus infections
are occurring increasingly widely so far this year (2011), with cases
reported from 7 districts.
