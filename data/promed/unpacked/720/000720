Limit Egg Intake Warning as Traces of Toxin Found
-------------------------------------------------
Children and people with heart conditions were today being warned to limit
the number of eggs they eat after traces of a toxic drug were found in
around one in 10 tested.
Organic farming group the Soil Association issued the advice in light of
new [UK] Government figures which reveal 12 percent of eggs tested
contained residues of Lasalocid.
The antibiotic, which is used to treat parasitic stomach infections in
livestock, gets into laying hens and consequently eggs through batches of
chicken feed which have been contaminated by accident.
People with cardiac arrhythmia, children, and adults who eat 3 or 4 eggs a
day are most at risk from the drug, the association claims.
It says Lasalocid has been linked to increased heart and breathing
rates, paralysis and even death in poultry. It has also voiced concerns
that there may be a link between the consumption of contaminated eggs and
Sudden Adult Death Syndrome.
Richard Young, policy advisor at the Soil Association, claims current egg
testing methods are not thorough enough to weed out the majority of
contaminated eggs.
"In this country [UK] we eat 26 million eggs a day, and there are only about
250 sample egg tests, so the question is how many contaminated eggs slip
through the net?" he said. "If you're a consumer that gets the bad eggs,
you're not just going to get one bad egg. The whole batch that egg came
from is probably contaminated, so you're going to get a whole bad lot at
one time."
Consumers should be aware of the potential danger and limit their daily egg
intake, according to the association. Mr Young said: "We advise people to be
moderate in the way they eat eggs. Eat organic if you can and certainly give
organic eggs to children, and 2 eggs in one day would be the maximum you
should have."

[Lasalocid is a feed additive drug in the class of ionophores. It is a drug
for use in animals only, and there is no comparable drug or drug category
for humans.
However, rules of the European Union have banned lasalocid from being added
to feed that is given to laying hens. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate
(VMD) is responsible for enforcing this legislation within the UK.
Although this problem may have existed before, the maximum level of lasalocid
reported in eggs has risen significantly over the past year from 620
micrograms/kilogram in 2002 to 3450 in 2003. 2 of the 250 samples contained
levels above 3000 micrograms/kilogram.
According to the Food Safety Agency (FSA), the levels of lasalocid in eggs
do not raise any immediate health concerns for consumers. The FSA doesn't
recommend a limit on how many eggs should be eaten. However, babies under 6
months should not be fed eggs because of the potential risk of allergic
reactions.
Some eggs contain salmonella bacteria, which can cause serious illness,
especially among elderly people, babies, toddlers, pregnant women and
people who are already unwell. So that means you always need to be careful
how you use eggs, but particularly when you are preparing food for one of
these groups.
There are 3 main issues you should be aware of:
- avoiding the spread of bacteria
- cooking eggs properly
- storing eggs safely. - Mod.TG]
[The carboxylic ionophores are open-chained oxygenated heterocyclic
rings with a single terminal carboxyl group of moderate molecular weight
(200-2000). Ionophores form lipid-soluble complexes with polar cations
(K+, Na+, Ca ++ and Mg++), have a diverse antibacterial spectra and are
produced by fungi, predominantly _Streptomyces sp_.
These compounds are used as anticoccidial and growth promotant feed
additives. Lasalocid is used in broiler chickens (brand name Avatec) for
the prevention of coccidiosis caused by _Eimeria sp._ and in cattle
(brand name Bovatec) for improved feed efficiency and increased rate of
weight gain.
Clinical pathology of ionophore-induced toxicity includes elevated enzyme
levels of muscle origin such as aspartate transaminase (AST) and
creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Other serum enzymes that may be elevated
are lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase. Additonally,
there may be elevations in blood urea nitrogen and bilirubin. Serum calcium
and potassium levels may fall to life-threatening levels in horses.
Hemoconcentration may also occur.
The ionophores are generally safe at prescribed levels in intended species.
Certain management situations increase the possibility of toxicoses including
overdose, mixing errors, premix consumption, and misuse in non-target species
such as horses, adult turkeys, and dogs. Concurrent administration of other
drugs, including chloramphenicol, erythromycin, sulfonamides and cardiac
glycosides, can potentate ionophore toxicosis.
Calcium ionophores (Lasalocid is a divalent ionophore) clearly have
effects in human cells. Binding of calcium can produce the signs and
symptoms of hypocalcemia and can upregulate or downregulate cellular
functions based on the role of calcium in such processes. It is unclear
if the levels in the eggs would cause clinical or subclinical effects in
humans.
