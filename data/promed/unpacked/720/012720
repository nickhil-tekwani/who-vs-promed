[1] Case update
- 10 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation 9 Jun 2018, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=295edda0a4

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 9 Jun 2018:
- a total of 66 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 14 suspected;
- 3 new suspected cases, including 1 in Wangata and 2 in Iboko;
- In Itipo, in the health zone of Iboko, 8 suspected cases dating from 8 Jun 2018 were reported only this Sun 10 Jun 2018 because of communication problems in the area. Samples are being analyzed;
- 4 samples were negative;
- death of a confirmed case in Iboko [to date total of 28 deaths; 14 of them among the confirmed cases]

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
Since the launch of the vaccination on [21 May 2018], 2221 people have been vaccinated, including 713 in Mbandaka, 498 in Bikoro, 980 in Iboko, and 30 in Ingende.

The vaccination coverage (2221 people vaccinated) is impressive. It would be helpful to know if the 2nd phase of response ("expeditionary surveillance") also includes vaccination of the search team and of the individuals they encounter whom they feel are at high risk. Is there a mechanism to maintain the cold chain required for vaccine stability in these remote areas? As mentioned in the 9 Jun 2018 ProMED mail post (archive no. 20180609.5847441), very little information has been provided on this 2nd phase in the forested rural area where significant challenges must be overcome for success. It's not clear how many teams are part of this 2nd phase of response, and which groups are participating. It should be noted the epidemiological report above mentions communication problems, which may be huge not only because of the remoteness of the area, but also possibly because of the number of people involved and the lack of high tech communication equipment, in addition to the different dialects of the indigenous people. - Mod.LK

Additional questions raised on the "expeditionary surveillance" phase include:
- Will the teams be equipped with portable rapid diagnostic capabilities, to identify Ebola virus disease and distinguish it from other diseases?
- If they find another disease, how will they respond?
- Will confirmed cases be treated on site or transported to an ETU (Ebola treatment unit)?
- Will the traditional response of isolation be encouraged as a supplement to vaccination and/or as a plan B if vaccination is not possible?
- Will the teams collect samples from the dead to test on site or to bring back to a laboratory for testing? - Rapp.MM]

[2] Preparation for future outbreaks
- 10 Jun 2018. Natural reservoir in the Equatorial forest
[Actualite.cd, in French, machine trans., summ., edited]
https://actualite.cd/2018/06/10/oly-ilunga-ebola-a-un-reservoir-naturel-dans-la-foret-equatoriale-la-rdc-doit-sattendre-a-une-10e-epidemie-et-sy-preparer/

Oly Ilunga: "Ebola has a natural reservoir in the equatorial forest, the DRC must expect a 10th epidemic and prepare for it"

The Ebola virus has a natural reservoir located in the equatorial forest, so the country must expect to face a 10th epidemic and prepare for it, said Oly Ilunga, Minister of Health, during the press conference organized in Kinshasa on the occasion of the 1st response to the Ebola virus disease in Equateur province.

He argued that each outbreak offers an opportunity to improve the country's epidemiological surveillance system and the resilience of its health system.

"All the funds not used in this epidemic will be dedicated to the rehabilitation of the health facilities of the Province," he added.

[Clearly each successive outbreak informs countries so they are better prepared for the next outbreak. In this case, the DR Congo is taking important steps to better control future outbreaks of any disease, including making universal healthcare a reality and improving the country's epidemiological surveillance system. - Mod.LK]

[3] Research
- 10 Jun 2018. Doing Ebola research during an emergency

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
Equateur is different from other parts of the DRC. 40 percent of its population is Twa, an African Pygmy group that lives interdependently with agricultural Bantu-speaking populations, providing them with game [that is, bushmeat. - Rapp.MM] in exchange for farm products. The Twa population is already marginalized and vulnerable, and the research effort will face many issues related to language and culture, beginning with understanding and communicating perceptions of risk, vaccination, and treatment. ...

Conducting research alongside response is completely different from the usual setup of a research institution, Rebecca Grais [director of research at the MSF Epicenter in Paris] points out near the end of our conversation. It's not necessarily more complicated -- you just need to know how to do it. "When people say it is really hard -- just look at these roads! -- I think: this is Congo," she says. "This is only difficult if this is not what you do every day. Sometimes even in terms of making compromises, that's often used as an excuse: Oh well, the conflict is difficult, so we didn't do that. But I would make the counterargument, which is that you are dealing with the most vulnerable, so if anything, your degree of rigor must be very high."

"There are all these practical things," Grais says, "and you have the collision of all these different worlds at the same time: the humanitarian world, the research world, the North-South, different populations and languages." Grais is the director of research at the MSF Epicenter in Paris, an organization created in 1986 to provide epidemiologic expertise to support MSF operations ...

... [The] outbreak may offer the best scenario for learning more about the vaccine. The DRC has had -- and has controlled -- multiple Ebola outbreaks. The country has experienced public health teams and has had excellent collaborations with MSF and other international organizations for many years. The collaborators should be able to implement their plans, but some things are different this year that make doing so more challenging.

Grais notes that in addition to the rural outbreaks, "the other thing that makes this different is that there have been cases in Mbandaka, the capital of the Equateur province, with a population of about a million and connections to Kinshasa [the capital of DRC]. This changes the degree of difficulty."

Yet the ministry of health, MSF, and the Epicenter team started preparing for such an effort before the last DRC epidemic in the spring of 2017: they wrote protocols and submitted them to the national health authorities in DRC, worked closely and trained with the ministry of health, discussed and modified the plans to be sure the people involved on the ground understood and agreed to them. "The protocol isn't the part that is complicated here," Grais says. "The hard part is how do you make a series of quick judgment calls on the spot, keeping in mind the fact that you are a visitor and you want this information to be shared. That is the part that is tough."

It is, of course, impossible to run a randomized, placebo-controlled trial now. So MSF is running an open-label, single-group study to provide additional information on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. Everybody who consents to take part will be included, and participants will be followed for at least 42 days (twice what is often considered to be the maximum incubation period of Ebola virus disease), whether or not they choose to be vaccinated.

... [The] WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization recommended in April 2017 that "the rVSVDG-ZEBOV-GP vaccine be promptly deployed under the Expanded Access framework, with informed consent and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice" if an Ebola disease outbreak "occurred before the candidate vaccine is licensed."

Since the vaccine is not yet licensed, this is the only way to use it, according to Salama. One of the advantages is that liability is covered by the WHO. But the WHO approach differs in some details from the research approach MSF described to me 2 days earlier. Early or expanded access programs (EAPs), also called compassionate use programs, are in place to provide access to medicinal products that have not yet received regulatory approval. In a clinical trial setting, the primary intent is research, whereas in an EAP the intent is treatment. Such a program is therefore usually managed differently from a clinical trial in terms of both documentation and approval processes. But both MSF and the WHO are eager to see research integrated into the operational responses, because, as Salama says, "otherwise we simply will never learn" what the best approach is.

Salama believes the greatest challenges and risks involved in deploying the new vaccine are related to communication and logistics. "The communication has to be handled very carefully, since we are bringing in vaccine, but it is only going to very specific people," he says. "It is extremely important to get that right." And getting the logistics right is even harder. The Equateur province is in the middle of one of the densest forests on the planet, with no roads except some tracks that are passable only by motorcycle. It takes a huge logistical effort just to get people and equipment there, not to mention a vaccine that needs to be stored at -60 to -80 deg C [-76 to -112 deg F].

Close collaboration with the local government and mutual trust are other keys to success. Salama explains how essential it is that Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the DRC minister of health, is hands-on, engaged, effective, and very committed. "He was at the airport texting me at midnight 2 nights ago because he wanted to make sure he would personally go and receive the vaccine that we flew from Geneva to Kinshasa, to make sure it didn't get stopped in customs clearance processes and could be taken straight to the cold chain," Salama says. "It is a very delicate vaccine, and he didn't want anything to happen to it. He personally met the vaccine at the airport and cleared it through customs -- at a very odd hour of the night. It is that level of commitment that it takes. And we don't often see that type of commitment anywhere around the world."
