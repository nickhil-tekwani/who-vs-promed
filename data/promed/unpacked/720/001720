The Ohio State Health Department has reported that the percentage of
raccoons developing possible rabies immunity following a vaccine program is
remaining at about 30%. The results of the latest round of trapping during
the summer showed that 32% of 423 raccoons tested positive for rabies
antibodies.
The number of raccoons that have tested positive for rabies virus has
dropped to 19 in December 1998 from 59 in December 1997.
Officials have been air-dropping vaccine laden fish-meal cakes in eastern
Ohio since May 1997 in response to a raccoon rabies epidemic spreading from
Pennsylvania. More than one million vaccine laden baits have been dispensed
by helicopters and from specially equipped planes borrowed from the Ontario
Ministry of Health.
