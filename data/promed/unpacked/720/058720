UNEXPLAINED DEATHS, CANINES - USA (MULTISTATE) (04)

The rumors and misunderstanding continue; the fact is that this is not
influenza and very few dogs have died.
Best estimates are that on the tracks that have been involved, the
morbidity ranges between 60 and 80 percent, with a mortality of less than 1
percent and always due to secondary bacterial pneumonia. The few clusters
of deaths are due to a failure to recognize the seriousness of bacterial
pneumonia in greyhounds and to treat with the correct combination of
antibiotics. In fact, there are a number of tracks that have re-opened.
We have talked directly to tracks all over the country and I visited the
Dairyland Race Track on Sunday and Monday. They have more than 1100
dogs. The dogs cough but do not have elevated temperatures (essentially
rules out influenza). In fact, beyond coughing, the dogs are actually
quite healthy and recover fully in 8 to 12 days.
Out of over 800 coughing dogs over the past 2 weeks only about 10 have had
sudden high temperatures. These respond rapidly to antibiotics within 4
hours (again clearly not influenza). They have excellent records that
should be of value. The incubation period is about 4 days, with treatment
having little impact on the duration or frequency of coughing.

We have samples in the lab and should know more very soon. But by all
measures this a classic _Bordatella bronchiseptica_-induced kennel cough,
as is well described in the literature but not been seen by many. It is
very similar to an outbreak that took place in 1999. I suspect that we are
simply dealing have a new strain and/or a highly susceptible population.

[We appreciate Dr. Fenwick's response and the opportunity to post his
response regarding the situation with greyhounds. However, what Dr. Fenwick
is seeing may not be related to what Dr. Crawford reported; we have no way
of knowing that.
ProMED-mail makes reasonable efforts to verify what is posted. However,
with limited verification there appeared to be an usually high number of
mortalities from some type of respiratory disease. Armed with Dr.
Crawford's report, 17 media releases, and numerous telephone calls
reflecting a greyhound respiratory disease, it seemed appropriate to post.
However, as Dr. Fenwick points out, perhaps the severity of respiratory
illness in these canine athletes is not treated aggressively enough.
Perhaps it is not related to Dr. Crawford's report at all. - Mod.TG]

Please add the following to _Bordatella bronchiseptica_ as causes of kennel
cough, or infectious tracheobronchitis of dogs. The following viruses have
been implicated in the disease. Sometimes they merely damage the mucosa
and allow bacterial and mycoplasma infection.
CAV-2 (Canine AdenoVirus)
CPI (Canine ParaInfluenza virus)
Canine Distemper Virus
CAV-1
Canine Reoviruses type 1,2, or 3
Canine Herpesvirus
Other bacteria that may causes signs similar to those of _B. bronchiseptica
_ include Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, _E. coli_, Pasteurella, and Streptococcus
Though no influenza viruses are listed, there is a Parainfluenza virus.
