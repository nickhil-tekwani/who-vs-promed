Malaria downs 122 in South Cotabato
-----------------------------------
The provincial government of South Cotabato has intensified its operations
against an outbreak of malaria, which has reportedly afflicted at least 122
people in 5 municipalities over the last few weeks.
Arnold Giniseran, team leader of the provincial health office's malaria
control program, said they have quarantined several upland villages in the
municipalities of Lake Sebu, T'boli, Tantangan, Tupi, and Banga to prevent
the further spread of the mosquitoborne disease. Of the 5 municipalities,
barangays Ned and Halilan in Lake Sebu were hit hardest with at least 40
people already downed [this term implies ill rather than dead, as the next
paragraph shows. - Mod.SH] by malaria, Giniseran said. Other areas placed
under quarantine were barangays Kematu, Edwards, and Zigzag in T'boli;
Tacub and El Ulit in Tantangan; sitio Mambusong in barangay Cebuano, Tupi;
and sitio Lambukay in barangay Lamba, Banga.
"These case [numbers] are quite higher than the same period last year,"
said Giniseran, adding that no deaths have been reported. He said most of
those afflicted by malaria are from areas previously hit by the disease in
the past few years.
Some of the malaria cases were reportedly traced from communities in
Columbio and Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat where malaria is considered to be
more endemic than in South Cotabato.
Giniseran said they are currently conducting massive malaria eradication
activities in the affected areas. These include case finding and treatment,
particularly the collection of smears, treatment of symptomatic patients
and confirmation of positive cases, and distributing treated mosquito nets.
He said that houses of affected residents are sprayed with disinfectants.
"We also conduct massive information dissemination and capability building
training to rural health midwives and barangay health workers," Giniseran
added.
Last Monday, Dr Edgardo Sandig, provincial health officer, warned residents
[about] the resurgence of malaria due to the rainy season. He immediately
directed the intensification of health education among residents on
preventive measures against malaria, especially among communities in Lake
Sebu and T'boli, where an outbreak was monitored at this time in 2003. He
attributed the high incidence of malaria in Lake Sebu and T'boli to the
area's topography and high altitude, which he said are conducive for
mosquitoes to thrive.

[Malaria is endemic on Mindanao, but the areas reporting an increase in
transmission have previously been regarded as low risk areas. Overall there
has been little progress in malaria control in the Philippines over the
past 10 years. - Mod.EP]
