SARS In China: Tracking The Origin of the Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Where did SARS come from? The question is crucial for understanding whether
the disease will reemerge, but so far, there's lots of dissent with no
solid answers.

At Dongmen market, almost everything that's vaguely edible is for sale. The
cavernous 2-story concrete building in Shenzhen, close to the Hong Kong
border, houses hundreds of vendors selling live animals and seafood. Geese,
ducks, chickens, pigeons, doves, and wild birds are packed wing to wing in
metal cages stacked 2 and 3 high, their minders napping on top as they wait
for the next shopper. Nearby, rabbits are squashed in cages, and turtles
and crabs in huge metal tubs scramble over each other.

But the market has lost some of its legendary variety. Masked palm civets,
for one, are missing. Before the SARS virus erupted out of nowhere in
Guangdong last fall, eventually sweeping through Hong Kong, Beijing,
Taiwan, and Toronto and killing more than 800 people, these distinctive
catlike creatures were readily available at Dongmen and similar markets
across the province. Restaurateurs bought them for meat, said to be tasty
and fabled to strengthen the body against winter chills. Now, however, the
civets, raccoon dogs, and many of the other exotic species that are staples
of Guangdong's eclectic cuisine are gone. Asking about civets brings either
an amused chuckle or, occasionally, a glare and a dismissive wave of the hand.

Here at Dongmen, a research team from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) and
the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found the
most intriguing leads yet about the possible origins of SARS. 2 different
animal species on sale here were found to harbor the virus: civets and
raccoon dogs. Antibodies to the virus were detected in a Chinese ferret
badger. The government intervened, and since then, Shenzhen shopping has
not been the same.

If the virus does not have a reservoir or permanent hideout in animals, the
world can breathe a little more easily. But virologists suspect there is an
animal reservoir, an ecological niche in which the virus evolved and
continues to thrive. "Until we know what that source is and until steps
have been taken to neutralize the source, then clearly the potential [for
the virus to re-emerge] exists," says Meirion Evans, an epidemiologist at
the Communicable Disease Surveillance Center in Cardiff, U.K., who has been
working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to understand the SARS
outbreak. Despite the heightened awareness of the disease, "the experience
of SARS is that it doesn't take very long to break out of a local area and
go cross-border, if not global," Evans adds.

So far, however, the hunt for the reservoir is yielding more confusion than
clarity. Unlike the HKU-Shenzhen CDC investigators, a research team at the
China Agriculture University (CAU) in Beijing has been unable to find any
trace of the SARS virus in civets or dozens of other species it has
sampled. The Beijing scientists have questioned the earlier work and
criticized the group for not sharing its data; the Hong Kong group has
responded in kind. But emerging-disease experts say that both groups could
be right, and the apparent discrepancy shows just how tricky the hunt for
the reservoir will be.

A large, well-coordinated effort by multiple teams is needed to sort out
these questions and identify the reservoir, assert WHO officials, who last
week won permission from Chinese authorities to send in four teams of
experienced animal-virus hunters from the Netherlands, Australia, the
United States, and Japan. "Having no answers will not be good enough;
that's the clear message we're getting from our member states," says Henk
Bekedam, who leads WHO's Beijing office.

A WHO fact-finding mission in April 2003 picked up the first clues about
the origins of SARS. When the researchers were reviewing data on the
earliest cases of an unusual form of pneumonia that had appeared in
Guangdong between November 2002 and February of 2003, team member Evans was
struck by the fact that "a fairly high proportion" of early SARS patients
were classified as "food handlers," a category that includes everyone from
animal wholesalers through the supply chain to cooks. In May, Evans led a
second delegation that reviewed the data with Chinese epidemiologists and
found that 9 of 23 early patients worked in the food industry. People
living in the vicinity of markets were overrepresented as well. Evans also
learned that many restaurants in the province keep live animals on the
premises and slaughter them as needed, a practice that could expose
restaurant workers to virus-laden blood and excrement. Yet, there was no
evidence that the disease was spread by eating infected animals.
Speculation soon centered on Guangdong's palate for exotic fare.

By that time, several teams had fingered a previously unknown coronavirus
as the cause of SARS. Its novel RNA sequence suggested that, unlike
coronaviruses normally found in pigs, cattle, chickens, or humans, this
virus had probably evolved in isolation for a long time before making the
leap to humans. Realizing that the live animal markets provided fertile
grounds for animals and humans to swap infectious agents, Yi Guan, a
virologist and member of the HKU team that was among the first to identify
the virus, decided to investigate. With colleagues at the Shenzhen CDC, he
drove to the Dongmen market, just 15 minutes from the Hong Kong border. The
team sampled 25 animals, representing 8 exotic species.

Analyzing the samples back at their labs in Hong Kong, the researchers
isolated a coronavirus almost identical to the human SARS virus from all 6
masked palm civets and from a single raccoon dog. They also detected
antibodies to the virus, indicating prior exposure, in a Chinese ferret
badger. The 5 other species sampled, also tested by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR), proved negative. Underscoring the disease link, the
researchers found evidence of antibodies to the SARS virus in a number of
animal market workers, whereas previous studies had shown that antibodies
were not present in the wider population. Only one difference appeared in
the viral RNA isolated from the market animals: It was 29 nucleotides
longer than RNA isolated from humans. This has fueled speculation that the
virus may have become more adept at propagating in humans after losing a
piece of its genome. But the picture is complicated by the fact that
researchers at the Beijing Genomics Institute say they have found at least
2 humans who were infected with the longer variety. Researchers hope
further studies of each strain's characteristics -- including animal
experiments -- may clarify whether the minuscule difference really is
important.

As had become the norm among researchers working on the SARS frontline, the
HKU team on 23 May 2003 announced its findings at a press conference before
submitting the results for scientific review. Although the team emphasized
that the study simply indicated a link between the virus and the exotic
animal trade, press reports implied that civets were spreading the disease,
if not functioning as the hotly sought reservoir. Chinese authorities
immediately, although temporarily, banned hunting, selling, transporting,
and exporting all wild animals. They also quarantined all farm-raised
civets in Guangdong.

Then on 19 Jun 2003, a competing group at CAU held its own press conference
to announce results from its exhaustive search for the reservoir. The
researchers, led by the university's vice president, agronomist Sun Qixin,
had cast a wide net, sampling 54 wild and 11 domestic animal species from 6
provinces and Beijing. Using the PCR technique, they found not a trace of
the SARS virus -- an apparent contradiction to the findings of the
HKU-Shenzhen CDC team. Intrigued by Guan's report on infected animals, the
Beijing team had paid extra attention to the masked palm civet, buying 3 of
them in Guangdong and another 73 wild and farmed animals elsewhere. All
samples were negative. (The researchers claim that they isolated a
different coronavirus from the civets, but its sequence is only 77 percent
similar to that of the SARS virus.) Although the CAU researchers stop short
of saying Guan's findings are wrong, they sharply criticize his team
members for refusing to release additional details that might allow others
to verify their claims.

Guan says he will open access to the sequence data once his team's paper,
which he says is now under review at [the journal] Science, is accepted.
But the difficulty lies in interpreting those results. Guan declines to
discuss the details until the paper is published. But he emphasizes, "We
never claimed that civets were the animal reservoir, nor even that civets
were the source of the human infection." Guan says his findings simply
"open the door for further investigations" to trace the chain of
transmission back to the source.

Guan, Field, and Chen all agree that it's unlikely that civets are a
crucial part of the natural life cycle of the SARS virus. A more probable
scenario, they say, is that the civets picked up the virus from another
more exotic animal, perhaps in the markets or holding facilities, where
many different species are confined in close quarters. Or these particular
civets could have been infected in the wild before being brought to market.
Field notes that the Nipah virus, which killed more than 100 in an outbreak
in Malaysia in 1998 and 1999, was ultimately found to have traveled from
its reservoir, fruit bats, through pigs to humans. A similarly circuitous
transmission route is likely for the SARS virus.
