The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets has confirmed 5 new cases of equine West Nile virus.

In the 1st case, an unvaccinated, 19-year-old mare in Clinton County showed clinical signs including lethargy, unwillingness to move, muscle tremors, and ataxia. The mare was treated for several days, but was ultimately euthanized on 20 Sep 2017.

The 2nd case was in an unvaccinated 13-year-old mare in Livingston County. She was found in her stall with a swollen muzzle and signs consistent with being cast on 14 Sep 2017. The mare was uncoordinated and reluctant to move upon examination, but was still alive at the time of the report.

The 3rd case was in a 2-year-old colt with no vaccination history in St Lawrence County. He presented with hind end weakness, was hyper-responsive to stimuli, and had muscle tremors in the shoulders on 12 Sep 2017. The outcome of the case is unknown.

In the 4th case, an unvaccinated yearling filly in Erie County showed an onset of clinical signs on 15 Sep 2017. She progressed from off feed to a high fever and neurologic signs, including twitching of the head, uncoordinated walk, and tail held off to the side. Despite treatment, the horse continued to decline, went down on 21 Sep 2017, had seizures, and was euthanized the same day.

The 5th case was in a yearling filly in Genesee County with no vaccination history. She showed onset of clinical signs on 15 Sep 2017 that included leaning and unsteadiness. A veterinarian attended the filly on 16 Sep 2017. The owners elected euthanasia.

A local veterinarian announced [Tue 26 Sep 2017] that Pulaski County has its 1st confirmed case of the season of West Nile virus in a horse.

However, the good news is as of Tuesday afternoon [26 Sep 2017], there have been no confirmed cases in humans within Pulaski or indeed the entire Lake Cumberland District, according to Lake Cumberland District Health Department Medical Director Christine Weyman. Weyman said that within Kentucky there have been 5 reported West Nile cases for humans this year [2017].

The disease, which is spread through mosquitoes, can affect horses, humans and some other types of animals like chickens, said Dr Bruce Burkett of Somerset Animal Hospital.

Burkett reported that a horse exhibiting signs was brought into his office by its owner a couple of weeks ago. Test results from the state lab came back Tuesday morning [26 Sep 2017] confirming the disease.

"We now know that mosquitoes in Pulaski County are carrying West Nile virus in high enough concentrations to infect a horse," Burkett said.

The horse in question is a 2-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse from eastern Pulaski that has never been vaccinated against the disease, he said.

"The horse is doing fine. It's responding to treatment and is recovering," he said, but he added that many horses do not respond. Horses are susceptible to contracting West Nile.

While there is no vaccination for the disease in humans, there is for horses, and Burkett said he would encourage farmers to get their horses vaccinated.

When the disease first hit the US in 1999, Burkett said several Kentucky cases for horses were reported, but shortly afterwards owners began vaccinating their livestock.

In the past few years, the number of cases has dropped, and some farmers either didn't get the booster shots for their horses or didn't vaccinate them at all, meaning the number of cases may rise again.

But beyond horses, Burkett showed concern for Pulaski's human residents, urging residents to take precautions.

While the majority of people infected by the virus show no symptoms or very mild symptoms, less than 1 percent will develop more serious symptoms including neurologic illnesses like, encephalitis or meningitis, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

As Burkett points out, however, "If that 1 percent is one of your family members, that number doesn't matter."

Symptoms for severe cases include headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, seizures or paralysis.

For horses, signs of a serious West Nile infection include fever, weakness or paralysis of hind limbs, aimless wandering, seizures, hyperexcitability and coma.

For humans and horses alike, the best way to prevent contracting the disease is to take precautions against mosquitoes and eliminate their breeding grounds.

Burkett suggested removing or avoiding standing water and mowing tall grass. For people, he suggested wearing long sleeves and using mosquito repellent while outside.

He added that the problem mosquitos will be around throughout the fall, until the 1st "hard freeze," and that he expected more equine cases to pop up among unvaccinated animals.

Regardless of location, mosquitoes can and do carry diseases. It is imperative we protect our animals and ourselves. The West Nile virus vaccination for horses is usually combined with eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and tetanus vaccines. This one injection needs to be given twice, about 3-4 weeks apart. There are specific mosquito repellent sprays for horses. Please also remember to wear your own mosquito repellent. The disease in humans is not pleasant, I understand. - Mod.TG]
