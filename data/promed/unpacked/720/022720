[My apologies for the lengthy delay since the last update. While there have been a total of 10 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported during this period, there were 6 days during which there were no newly confirmed cases reported. With the addition of these newly confirmed cases and deaths, there have now been a total of 977 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 425 deaths, reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012. The case fatality rate continues to hover around 43.5 percent. More detailed information on individual cases and possible high risk exposures can now be found on the WHO updates (see section [2] below).

MOH Releases Weekly Report on Coronavirus, Recorded 7 Cases Last Week
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that cases of infection with the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) recorded decline during the last 3 weeks at a rate of 7 cases per week. In its weekly report about the latest development regarding the disease, MOH said that its labs have tested 1425 samples of the virus over the period from [21 Mar 2015 to 5 Apr 2015] (corresponding to 9-15 Jumada, 1436H), pointing out that 7 confirmed cases were recorded amid people aged between 39 and 80 years. They are distributed as follows: 3 cases in Jeddah and one case in each of Riyadh, Eastern Province, Tabuk and Al-Ahsa.

The MOH pointed out that about half of the cases recorded last week resulted from direct contacts with camels (2 cases), and community-acquired cases, while 2 cases only were recorded amongst health practitioners, and another case still under examination. Despite the significant decline in the recorded cases, MOH made clear that "we are still in the MERS-CoV season and we must not rush to reap the rewards," stressing that "preparations will remain in place, and that efforts must continue with the collaboration of all parties led by the community cooperation and the health practitioners who are the cornerstone in this regard." Regarding the complaints being handled by the Ministry of Agriculture teams, the Ministry highlighted that there are 2 complaints reported in Hafouf and Khafji.

Within the same vein, the MOH underscored that the Command and Control Center (CCC) keeps on its efforts around the clock by carrying out epidemiological surveillance tasks, making sure that all governmental and private health facilities are applying infection control measures as well as coordinating with the relevant government sectors, international health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), and consulting firms to follow up all developments regarding coronavirus.

In line with that, MOH is carrying on its efforts to raise the awareness of community members with the prevention ways against the infectious viruses, particularly the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as (We can stop it) awareness campaign is geared up to launch new activities in the malls and shopping centers of Jeddah and the Eastern region by the end of the current week. In addition to that short awareness video clips are currently displayed on the stadium screens during football games. The campaign also witnessed participation of volunteers who distributed about 40 000 awareness brochures on MERS-CoV to more than 12 000 persons at a number of Riyadh's malls and shopping centers.

It is worth mentioning that MOH's campaign is aiming at raising the awareness about the ways of prevention against infectious viruses through explaining the necessary health guidelines to be followed in during the day, in addition to distributing simple brochures and sterilizers to community members in the public places such as commercial complexes.

[The MOH weekly report summaries in sections [3] and [4] above are helpful to provide insight into nationalities of the expatriate cases and information on high risk exposures of the cases reported during the preceding week. For those of us maintaining a line listing of cases with individual case exposure histories, we miss the more detailed information previously provided on the MOH case report pages. The nationalities mentioned in the above report include Philippine, Yemeni, Sudanese, Pakistani and Bangladeshi. These cases serve as a reminder that the possibility of importation of MERS-CoV into other countries still exists, albeit experience to date has suggested that this is a very low occurrence. Of the 1082 reported cases of MERS-CoV infection evaluated on the ECDC rapid risk assessment on 8 Mar 2015, only 25 cases (2 percent) were reported in individuals outside of the Middle East, all of whom could be traced to either direct contact in the Middle East or contact with an individual who had been infected in the Middle East (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/MERS_update_08-Mar2014.pdf). - Mod.MPP]
