It is the 1st time since mid-January that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50 (1st report of more than 50 newly confirmed cases was on 18 Jan 2020 see Novel coronavirus (10): China (HU,GD,BJ) 20200119.6898567). In addition, 27 deaths were reported, all by Hubei province. Two new cases were reported from Hong Kong.

Of note is the increasing numbers of imported cases mentioned with 24 newly imported cases (17 in Gansu, 3 in Beijing, 3 in Shanghai and 1 in Guangdong), bringing the total number of imported cases to 60. It would be of interest to know where the importations were from.

C. Iran: 5823 cases, 145 deaths
Date: Sat 7 Mar 2020

Iran on Saturday [7 Mar 2020] reported 21 new deaths from the novel coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] and 1076 fresh cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the overall tolls to 145 dead and 5823 infected. "More than 16 000 people are currently hospitalized as suspect cases," Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference, adding that 1669 of confirmed cases had recovered from the illness.

Iran is battling one of the world's deadliest outbreaks of the disease outside China, where it originated. Iran's capital Tehran remains the worst-hit region in the country, with 1539 confirmed cases, though the situation is worsening in northern provinces. More than 300 of the new cases were reported in Mazandaran province, a top tourist destination north of Tehran on the Caspian sea. "Mazandaran is at the top of the list, as the necessary limitations [on domestic traveling] were not imposed," Jahanpour said. "Considering that a minority are not taking the situation seriously and risk their own and others' health, imposing limitations is now on the agenda."

Iran has closed schools and universities until early April [2020] in a bid to contain the virus, but upcoming holidays have prompted people to travel, especially to popular destinations in northern provinces, Jahanpour said Friday [6 Mar 2020]. Several provinces, including in the north and middle of the country, have said they will not provide any lodging to tourists in an effort to dissuade people from traveling.

[5] Cruise ships
A. The Grand Princess

The day when thousands of passengers and crew had once been scheduled to disembark from the Grand Princess cruise ship instead became another day of limbo [7 Mar 2020], with no word of where the stricken vessel might be heading next or when anyone aboard would be allowed to leave. With officials apparently still deciding where to dock the vessel with 21 people who have tested positive for coronavirus, the ship continued to circle idly in the open ocean dozens of miles west of San Francisco.

On Saturday [7 Mar 2020], cruise officials shed new light on how they believe the virus began its spread aboard the vessel across two journeys over the past several weeks. They identified a Placer County man who died on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] as the "index patient" who they believe brought the virus aboard.

The main recent activity aboard the vessel came late Friday night [6 Mar 2020], when the US Coast Guard delivered a load of supplies by helicopter to the ship. The Coast Guard also had to evacuate a sick passenger from the vessel who had fallen "critically ill", officials said Saturday [7 Mar 2020], though they stressed that the person needed medical attention for an ailment unrelated to COVID-19.

Back on land, public health officials were announcing a slew of new positive tests for the virus while disruptions to daily life kept mounting.

Speaking with cruise line industry officials at a briefing in Florida on Saturday [7 Mar 2020], Vice President Mike Pence reiterated a plan 1st announced on Friday [6 Mar 2020] to take the Grand Princess to a still-unspecified "non-commercial port", which Pence said was "being implemented this weekend". But Princess Cruises president Jan Schwartz said later in the day that the company is still waiting for officials to tell them where that port is, and said she did not know when a decision will be reached.

"We are hopeful that the federal, state and local authorities, and health experts, can quickly agree (on) a practical plan that prioritizes the health and welfare of all onboard Grand Princess and their home communities," Schwartz said during a conference call with reporters on Saturday [7 Mar 2020]. "We understand that discussions are ongoing with the various government authorities, and so we await a decision as to where we will be berthing the ship." In a message to passengers Saturday afternoon, the vessel's captain said that corporate officials from the cruise line were "urging the government to help us get our guests safely ashore as quickly as possible".

The ship's medical team was assessing its inventory of medications on board to fulfil "the most urgent requests" and looking into "sources to obtain the additional medication", according to a recording of the captain from a passenger. In his briefing, Pence also said that passengers and crew will be tested for the virus and "quarantined as appropriate".

But Grant Tarling, the chief medical officer for the Carnival Corporation, Princess' parent company, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has not told the company it will need to test everyone aboard, nor when that testing might happen. "We have not been told that officially by the CDC," Tarling said. In the meantime, cruise passengers were being confined to their rooms, with mask-wearing staff delivering them meals and forms they could use to request prescription medications they may be running low on as their time on the vessel stretches on, Schwartz said. The cruise line had given them access to more internet bandwidth and a bigger selection of movies, and had set up a confidential mental health hotline.

The ship's entertainment director also made an announcement to passengers, urging them to stay "active and moving". Several activities were planned, he said, including, on the stateroom TV, Tai Chi and "a 10-minute cabin Zumba!" "Please know that we are here for you," the entertainment director said. "We are all in this together. We will continue to keep you comfortable and occupied during this unforeseen situation."

Tarling said on Saturday [7 Mar 2020] that officials believe an elderly Placer County man who died from the virus on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] after returning home from a trip to Mexico on the cruise ship was the person who brought it aboard. "We believe his illness was probably community-acquired somewhere in California before he joined the ship," Tarling said, based on a timeline of when the man's symptoms started and the virus' incubation period. Tarling said the man sought treatment on the ship's onboard medical center during his cruise on [20 Feb 2020], near the end of the trip, complaining that he had been experiencing respiratory [symptoms] for "6 to 7" days. That timeline would mean the virus had been circulating in the state earlier than officials have previously thought. While the man was on the ship, Tarling said, investigators believe he may have passed the virus to 2 waiters who were consistently serving his table during meals. "We believe both the waiters that served that table may have been infected," Tarling said. Those crew members stayed on the ship for its next trip, the journey to Hawaii that was supposed to end Saturday [7 Mar 2020] , and have since tested positive for the virus.

Several other passengers who were on the 1st cruise have also tested positive for the virus after returning home.

About 46 people out of the roughly 3500 passengers and crew members were the first to receive tests. Tarling said those passengers and crew picked to be tested were those who had exhibited flu-like symptoms during the trip, and were believed to be at high risk. Pence said Friday [6 Mar 2020] that 19 crew members and 2 passengers had tested positive for coronavirus. Passengers said they learned the news of the 19 positive test results from Pence's press conference, which several found frustrating.

Long Beach city officials announced in the early afternoon that a passenger was taken to a hospital to be evaluated and tested for the coronavirus. While that was taking place, city officials said, the other travelers were being kept on board out of an "abundance of caution." The officials described the passenger as a woman. There was no official count of how many passengers were on board, but the ship can hold more than 4000 passengers. No time was provided for when the test result would be available.

A group of travelers who were expecting to enter the ship once the current passengers disembarked were left waiting as employees of the cruise line circulated among them, providing updates. The Panorama made its debut last year [2019] as the cruise line's 1st new ship on the West Coast in 20 years. It launched its 7-day Mexican Riviera service from Long Beach in December [2019], featuring trips to Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Cabo San Lucas.

[I suspect we will be hearing more reports such as this one, now that it has become apparent that cruise ships may be excellent incubation tanks for spreading the coronavirus. Early symptoms of COVID-19 can often be "written off" as due to jet lag and plane travel (extreme fatigue, dry cough) and people continue their travels unaware of the potential consequences to themselves and others. - Mod.MPP]

The United States is tracking a cruise ship that may have shared crew members with a ship carrying people who tested positive for COVID-19 Vice President Mike Pence said on Saturday [7 Mar 2020] "We are tracking at this point a ship that may have shared crew with the Diamond Princess or the Grand Princess and we've taken decisive action to hold until we do a full medical assessment of the crew on that ship," Pence said after a meeting with cruise line industry officials in Florida.

The vice president, who is heading a task force to manage the US response to the disease outbreak, did not identify the ship being tracked.

D. Nile cruise
Date: Sat 7 Mar 2020
Source: WSVN, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://wsvn.com/news/us-world/egypt-says-cruise-ship-quarantined-over-new-virus-cluster/


A cruise ship on Egypt's Nile River with over 150 tourists and local crew was in quarantine Saturday [7 Mar 2020] in the southern city of Luxor, as 45 people on board tested positive for the new coronavirus, authorities said. A Taiwanese-American tourist who had previously been on the same ship tested positive when she returned to Taiwan, the World Health Organization informed Egyptian authorities, who then tested everyone on the ship.

Health authorities first found that a dozen of the ship's Egyptian crew members had contracted the fast-spreading virus, and said they did not show symptoms, according to a joint statement from Egypt's Health Ministry and WHO on Friday [6 Mar 2020]. At a news conference in Cairo later Saturday [7 Mar 2020], health minister Hala Zayed said 33 others tested positive for the virus. Of the total 45 infected passengers and crew, 19 were foreigners, officials said. Zayed did not elaborate on the nationalities of the non-Egyptians.

Officials said the 45 would be transferred to isolation in a hospital on Egypt's north coast. The passengers -- who include Americans, French, and other nationalities -- and the remaining crew remained quarantined on the ship awaiting further test results. The US Embassy in Cairo said in a tweet it was working to provide consular services and assistance to the US citizens affected. The new cases brought to 48 the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Egypt, including 21 foreign nationals and 27 Egyptians.

A chef on the ship told The Associated Press that the crew received an inquiry from the Health Ministry about crew members showing flu-like symptoms. "Some of us were sick. Some with fever," he said. The 12 infected crew were isolated on the 3rd floor of the vessel away from the tourists, including 2 children, the chef said. The tourists then waited for test results.

The cruise started in Luxor, about 655 kilometers (405 miles) south of Cairo, on Sunday [1 Mar 2020]. The vessel, which includes 60 rooms, made 3 stops before reaching its destination at Aswan. On the return trip there were 3 more stops, Salah said, potentially expanding the number of people exposed to the virus. "It's still unclear how many people came in contact with the group in the infected ship," said a senior police officer in Luxor. Cruise ships on the Nile often dock side by side, with passengers getting on and off by walking through several other vessels. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters.

Egyptian authorities have been tight-lipped about the virus outbreak, previously reporting only 3 confirmed cases even as the wider Mideast now has over 6000 confirmed cases.

The new cases in Egypt came just days after 3 people were diagnosed with coronavirus in the US state of Texas. Officials in the city of Houston said on Thursday [5 Mar 2020] that they believe the 3 were exposed to the virus while on a trip to Egypt in late February [2020]. On Saturday [7 Mar 2020], officials in the US state of Maryland said 3 people -- a married couple in their 70s, and a woman in her 50s -- tested positive in Montgomery County and had contracted the virus while on an Egyptian cruise of the Nile River. It wasn't immediately clear if the Maryland and Texan tourists were on the same boat where the cluster occurred, how long the passengers on the ship had been quarantined, nor where exactly the initial Taiwanese tourist had contracted the virus.

The new and fast-spreading coronavirus could deliver a major blow to Egypt's tourism industry. The government has been struggling for years to revive the vital sector following the country's 2011 Arab Spring uprising.

[As a reminder, the identification of the problem in Egypt was made originally based on returning tourists to France, Canada, and the USA who were positive for COVID-19. A strong reminder that returning tourists are sentinels for events happening in tourist locations, not always recognized within the country of disease transmission. - Mod.MPP]

[6] Selected media reports of interest -- Italy to go on lockdown for northern provinces
Date: Sun 8 Mar 2020 4:36 am ET

Italy locks down much of the country's north over the coronavirus
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Italy's government weighed early Sunday [8 Mar 2020] took the extraordinary step of locking down much of the country's north, restricting movement for about a quarter of the population in regions that serve as the country's economic engine. The move represents the most sweeping effort outside China to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and is tantamount to sacrificing the Italian economy in the short term to save it from the ravages of the virus in the long term.

The coronavirus has already inflicted serious damage in Italy, one of the Continent's most fragile economies. It has led to the closing of all of the country's schools and, by Saturday [7 Mar 2020], it had infected the leader of one of the 2 parties in the governing coalition.

The measures will turn stretches of Italy's wealthy north -- including the economic and cultural capital of Milan and landmark tourist destinations such as Venice -- into quarantined enclaves. [Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte] did not say how long the restrictions would last, but an earlier draft weighed by the government on Saturday night [7 Mar 2020] said the decree would be in force until at least [3 Apr 2020]. The travel bans will prevent the free movement of roughly 16 million people.

By Saturday [6 Mar 2020], Italy had more than 5800 cases of the virus, 233 of them fatal, with increases of almost 800 infections and 49 deaths from the day before. Only China has had more people die after contracting the virus.

As the government met late into the night on Saturday [7 Mar 2020], ministers insisted the proposals were merely a draft. Confusion spread about whether officials would actually block travel or only recommend against it. As soon as the draft became public, shocked regional and municipal leaders in the north argued that they were caught off-guard and that implementing the rules so suddenly would be impossible.

Mr Conte also announced early on Sunday morning [8 Mar 2020] that the government would extend less restrictive measures previously imposed in the north, such as the closings of museums, movie theaters, discos, and betting parlors, to the rest of the country. He said conferences of doctors and other medical professionals would be "absolutely" banned. "We cannot allow it," he said.

Funerals and cultural events are all banned under the measures. The decree requires that people keep a distance of at least one meter from one another at sporting events, bars, churches and supermarkets. People with fevers, even if they had not yet been tested for the virus, are strongly recommended against leaving their homes, Mr Conte said. Those who have tested positive are barred from doing so.

Police officers and soldiers will be empowered to enforce containment measures. Churches may remain open, but Masses will be canceled.

The government decree essentially shuts down much of the northern region of Lombardy, Italy's largest and most economically productive, which accounts for a fifth of Italy's gross domestic product. Matteo Caroli, a professor of business management at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, said that if "the measures go beyond April [2020], the situation will become systemic and the damage serious". Last week the government announced a huge support package of 7.5 billion euros, or about USD 8.5 billion, in addition to Euro 900 million [about USD 1 billion] announced last week for families and businesses affected by the virus.

Leaked reports of the draft late Saturday [7 Mar 2020] night prompted panic in Milan but also resistance and anger from mayors and regional presidents across the political spectrum in the northern areas. In addition to Asti, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia, Rimini, Pesaro and Urbino, Venice, Padua, Treviso, Asti and Alessandria -- all in the north -- were set to be locked down.

But there were clear signs that the virus was spreading southward. Earlier on Saturday [7 Mar 2020], it touched the top of Italian politics as the leader of the governing coalition's Democratic Party said he was infected. "Well, it's arrived," Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the Democratic Party and the president of the region of Lazio, said in a Facebook video posted Saturday [7 Mar 2020]. "I also have the coronavirus."

The infection of Mr Zingaretti, who is based in Rome, provided vivid proof that the virus was no longer a matter of northern exposure, and that the entire country was now grappling with a public health emergency. Some members of Italy's parliament who come from the locked-down areas in the Lombardy region had already been quarantined. But the infection of a highly prominent figure like Mr Zingaretti, who felt feverish on Saturday [7 Mar 2020], raised the prospect that more Italian politicians had been exposed.

"Certainly a politician meets and hugs many people," said Giovanni Rezza, director of the infective illness department at the National Health Institute. "There is a risk of diffusion." Elected officials privately expressed concern that the country's parliament, with many representatives from the north, could be a new theater of contagion.

["We are facing an emergency, a national emergency," Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in announcing the government decree in a news conference after 2 am https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/world/coronavirus-news.html. It will be interesting to see how this plan is enacted, and how it is implemented in a society that values personal freedoms above all. It certainly appears as though the lockdown worked in China for slowing down transmission and interrupting transmission in provinces not hardly hit. Hopefully the same will occur in Italy. - Mod.MPP]

**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

****"Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 93. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 44 countries (including 1 territory) from the European region, 6 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 12 countries (including 2 territories) from the Americas region, and 6 countries from the African region. 44 countries/Territories are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Iceland newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission and clusters of cases was also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 21 114 including 413 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
