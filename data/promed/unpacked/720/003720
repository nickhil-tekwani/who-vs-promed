The African swine fever virus [ASFV] has been detected in a contagious state on Japanese soil for the 1st time, the government said Tuesday [2 Apr 2019]. The government has in the past detected genes of the ASFV in food brought from overseas, but never before has the virus been confirmed as being at an infectious stage.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said the discovery of an infectious form of the virus has prompted a decision to strengthen measures against illegal imports of livestock products.

The virus was discovered in sausages brought into the country from China in January [2019], the farm ministry said Tuesday [2 Apr 2019].

The virus only affects domesticated and wild pigs and boars, not humans, but there is no vaccine or effective treatment for the highly lethal virus, the ministry said.

The sausages were brought into Japan, apparently as souvenirs, by 2 passengers arriving separately at Chubu airport near Nagoya on planes from Shanghai and Qingdao on 12 Jan 2019, according to the ministry.

So far, no ASF infections have been reported in Japan, and it is unlikely that food infected with the virus would cause an outbreak unless pigs were fed with the infected food.

Under the law on infectious disease control for domestic animals, people who bring unauthorized animal products into the country could face a fine of up to one million Japanese Yen [USD 9000] or imprisonment for up to 3 years.

To date, authorities have only penalized serious violations, such as when unauthorized products were imported for sale, but the government now plans to tighten controls and take action against those who repeatedly import unauthorized livestock products.

ASF is more lethal than conventional swine fever, also known as hog cholera, with a number of outbreaks having been reported in parts of Japan since September 2018, the 1st time the virus had been detected in the country for 26 years.

An outbreak of ASF was reported in China last year [2018] and has since spread to Viet Nam and Mongolia.

[A rapid risk assessment of ASF introduction and spread in Japan, based on expert opinions, was published ahead of print in September 2018; its final abstract, published in October 2018, follows:
"A rapid risk assessment was conducted using a questionnaire composed of 10 questions asking experts in African swine fever (ASF) to identify and rank the potential risk factors associated with the introduction and spread of ASF in Japan. The experts participating in this risk assessment considered illegal food import, followed by transport routes and foreign workers, to be the most relevant pathway of ASF introduction into Japan. Kanto and Kyushu were identified as the most likely regions for ASF introduction. All experts agreed that China is the most likely source of ASF introduction into Japan. Most Japanese experts were of the view that the risk of ASF spread if introduced into Japan would be low, while foreign experts considered the risk to be moderate or high. Most experts answered that wild boars would play an important role in the persistence of ASF if the disease were to spread in Japan;" [J. Vet. Med. Sci.80(11): 1743-1746, 2018. doi:10.1292/jvms.18-0543].

The introduction of classical swine fever (CSF) into Japan in September 2018 after its absence during the 26 previous years, the identification of the introduced virus as closely related to Chinese and Mongolian strains, and the rapid, continuing spread of the virus in Japan's Gifu and Aichi prefectures (as of 1 Apr 2019, 247 wild boar and 17 farms found infected), underlines the seriousness of ASF introduction hazard.

Though the mode/route of CSF introduction into Japan has not been established, a scenario of local pigs/wild boar orally infected by CSF-contaminated food products introduced from China, or their waste, is high on the suspected routes list. - Mod.AS
