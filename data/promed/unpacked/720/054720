Anthrax has been detected in cattle in Sachsen-Anhalt.

The Ministry of Agriculture announced in Magdeburg on Thursday [17 Apr 2014] that 4 animals out of 95 have died so far. The district authorities declared that they have taken all necessary actions, such as the isolation of the farm. The origin of infection is still not known.

Anthrax is caused by bacteria and usually affects cloven-hoofed animals. The most recent case in Germany occurred in 2012 in the district of Stendal, Sachsen-Anhalt.

[Our thanks to Sabine for forwarding this report translated.

Anthrax is truly sporadic in Germany. The last outbreak in 2012 was in Sachsen-Anhalt and involved a dozen animals on one farm. The previous outbreak to that was in Bayern and involved soil from a building site being dumped onto a pasture where the index case occurred; overall, 2 herds were affected with 4 cases, and prior to that, nothing since 2000.

The site for this outbreak is yet to be revealed. The pattern for these recent outbreaks is of soil disturbance -- in 2012 from flooding -- and so we can probably presume that this outbreak will be similar. This is the usual pattern after this disease has been eradicated, of cattle grave disturbance, or of old buried contaminated industrial waste, such as tannery trimmings, sheep wool, and goat and horse hair.

Sachsen-Anhalt is to the immediate west of Berlin; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/germany.jpg. - Mod.MHJ
