BSE BRITISH FEED EXPORTS 1988 - 1991
====================================
The New York Times today carried an AP article "French irate at
British exports of feed linked to Mad Cows", based on an
article in Nature.
[extracted from NYT]
The science magazine Nature, citing the British Government statistics,
reported today that Britain sold Franch thousands of tons of potentially
contaminated feed from 1988 to 1991 that it had banned at home for fear
it carried mad cow disease.
Most of the feed imported by France - essentially ground up intestines,
brains, spinal cords, bones and other cow parts - was used to feed pigs
and chickens, not cows.
"In 1988 and 1989, the Britons didn't tell us the truth," said Henri Nallet,
who was Agricultural Minister of France at the time, calling the report
"absolutely scandalous."
Today British officials defended the exports. In London, the Ministry of
Agriculture said the British ban, first imposed in 1988, still permitted
exports of pig and chicken feed, and that the European Commission knew
about the exports. Britain, however, has since expanded the ban to include
all animal feed.
"There was never any scientific evidence to suggest that feeding of animal
bone meal is dangerous" to pigs and poultry, the European Commission
spokesman, Gerry Kiely said today.
[- The French government has reported some thirteen BSE affected herds and
that the majority if not all affected animals were reported by them to have
been imported from the UK. The normal incubation period for this disease is
4-6 years. MHJ]
