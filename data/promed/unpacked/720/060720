Why are the woylies all dying? Since 2001 the populations of these tiny Australian marsupials have mysteriously crashed by as much as 90 per cent. The species, which had already been driven to near-extinction in the early 20th century, had been on the path to recovery after successful conservation efforts protected them from foxes and other introduced predators. The rebound in population was enough to see the woylies removed from Australia's threatened species list in 1996, but 5 years later their numbers once again began to precipitously decline.

Now we have a clue for the cause of the mass die-off. It seems that a majority of woylies -- also known as brush-tailed bettongs (_Bettongia penicillata_) -- have been infected by parasites called trypanosoma. Similar trypanosoma parasites cause Chagas disease and sleeping sickness in humans in South America and Africa, respectively. Although trypanosoma protozoa were known to exist in Australia, scientists had previously assumed they were harmless to wildlife.

That may not be the case, according to research published this month [December 2013] in the International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife. Researchers tested both live and roadkill woylies and found that almost all bore one or more of 3 species, or clades, of trypanosoma parasites. In areas with declining woylie populations, 96 per cent of the animals were infected with what appears to be the worst of the 3 clades. Infected woylies displayed both tissue inflammation as well as evidence of damage to the heart muscles. Adriana Botero, a PhD candidate at Murdoch University in Perth and the lead author of the study, told ScienceNetwork Western Australia [http://www.sciencewa.net.au/topics/environment-a-conservation/item/2609-woylie-decline-linked-to-parasitic-infection.html] that these infections and tissue damage may make them more vulnerable to predators.

The researchers also studied 9 other marsupial species and found the parasites on them, but of the tested animals only the woylies had significant infection levels.

Meanwhile, another new study quantifies exactly how bad the woylie decline has become. According to research published this month [December 2013] in Oryx [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9094572], some of the worst-hit populations have declined by 95 per cent. Other groups have completely disappeared.

This work shows that one declining population of brush-tailed bettongs (_Bettongia penicillata_) was mainly parasitized by trypanosomes of clade A and had greater occurrence of mixed infections than a population that was not declining and was predominantly parasitized by trypanosomes of clade B. In addition, they found pathological findings (inflammatory processes) associated with mixed and clade A infections while they were absent in single infections by trypanosomes of clades B or C.

While the conclusions that trypanosomes may be implicated in the decline of this endangered species and it undoubtedly warrants further research, the results should be taken very carefully, mainly due to 2 reasons: 1) there are no replicates of declining and stable populations. Many factors -- some liable to contribute to woylie mortality -- were different between them, not only the prevailing trypanosome clade. 2) The association between clade A and mixed infections and pathological findings was established on the basis of the study of 13 woylie carcasses that were either sick-euthanized or road-kills.

Further studies are needed to be able to confirm a cause-effect relationship between infection and the inflammatory processes described. For example, what if individuals from declining populations are more susceptible to infections in general and the pathological processes observed are not solely caused by trypanosomes?

Nonetheless, considering the conservation status of this species, the findings are highly relevant and highlight the need of more research on these host-parasite interactions.
