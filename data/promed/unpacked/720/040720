[A] High doctor fatalities

The latest tragedy in Indonesia's fight against COVID-19 is the extraordinary rise of fatalities among Indonesian doctors.

The culprit has been identified as the more contagious coronavirus delta variant, which triggered a chain reaction in Indonesia's health system.

At least 545 doctors have died from the coronavirus since it was detected for the first time in the country in early March last year [2020].

This high rate of fatality sharply reduces hospital performance, not only in treating coronavirus patients but also in tending to many others in dire need of hospital care.

The month of July [2021] has been a particularly deadly month for Indonesian doctors. At least 108 doctors died due to the coronavirus between early and the mid of July [2021], and the number is expected to rise. This is a sharp increase compared to Indonesia's previous infection in January [2021] when the number of such fatalities was just 65 in the whole month.

The current high rate of fatalities among doctors is triggered by the spread of the much more contagious delta variant in Indonesia, which started in mid-May [2021]. It is believed to have spread first in the Central Java city of Kudus through migrant workers who returned home by the sea.

These workers were subject to less stringent health checks compared to travellers who entered Indonesia by air.

The sheer volume of cargo ships, entering Indonesia through numerous seaports has made monitoring of each and every crew member challenging for authorities, Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin reportedly conceded in mid-June [2021].

In early June [2021], half of subdistricts in Kudus were declared red zones due to the high infection numbers among medical workers and the local community.

Bed occupancy rate in the city's hospitals reached more than 90%. At least 30 doctors caught the coronavirus.

The Delta variant infection then swept through Kudus' surrounding areas including Jepara and Pati before making its way to other cities across the archipelago, including Jakarta.

The variant spread rapidly in part because people were criss-crossing the country, meeting their friends, families and relatives to celebrate the Idul Fitri [Eid al-Adha] holiday in May [2021].

[B] New variants
Date: Fri 23 Jul 2021

The speed and scale of the coronavirus outbreak in Indonesia has created a perfect breeding ground for a potential new super-strain that could be even more contagious and deadly than the delta variant, infectious disease experts from around the world are warning.

Last week Indonesia surpassed India and Brazil to become the country reporting the world's highest number of daily cases. On Thursday [22 Jul 2021], the archipelago reported more than 49 500 new cases and 1449 deaths.

"New variants always appear in regions or countries that cannot control outbreaks," said Dicky Budiman, an Indonesian epidemiologist researching coronavirus variants at Australia's Griffith University. "The World Health Organization [WHO] says if more than 5% of tests come back positive, the outbreak is uncontrollable. In Indonesia, it's been higher than 10% for 16 months at the start of the pandemic. Now it's higher than 30%. So you can imagine how high the possibility is for Indonesia to create a new variant or a super variant of COVID-19."

Amin Soebandrio, a director at of the Eijkman Institute, a government organisation studying tropical and emerging infectious diseases, says while no new variants have yet surfaced in Indonesia, vigilance is crucial. "With the increasing number of cases, we cannot deny that it's possible and have to carefully observe to identify new variants as soon as they emerge," he said.

The delta variant is "4 to 5 times more infectious than the original virus," said Shahid Jameel, India's top virologist who until recently led the advisory group at the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortia, which monitors variants of COVID-19.

Jameel says the situation in Indonesia is now "very similar" to India's 2nd wave due to "poor rates" of vaccination. Only 8% of Indonesians are fully vaccinated according to the Ministry of Health.

Representatives of 2 of the world's leading coronavirus research groups in the United States worry conditions in Indonesia are ripe for the emergence of a new COVID-19 variant of concern.

"The more infections in a community, the more a chance for a new variant," said Ali Mokdad, a professor of Health Metrics Sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. He also expressed concern about Indonesia's Eid al-Adha festival, which took place this week and "activity around it".

Dr. Robert Bollinger, a professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, warns COVID-19 "has the potential to mutate into a new variant every time it infects a new person. So the risk of new variants is highest in communities and countries with the highest number of new cases, which includes Indonesia."

But predicting where and when a new variant of concern will emerge, is currently beyond the ability of today's scientists.

"All I can say is that when you give an RNA virus like this the opportunity to run wild, it will accumulate random mutations more frequently and the chances of a new variant will increase," said Indian virologist Shahid Jameel.

"They should learn from India's experience, the foremost being a very quick surge in hospital capacity and oxygen availability. Because unfortunately, the worst is yet to come for the region."

[These and other heartbreaking stories currently coming out of Indonesia reflect the fact that Indonesia is now at or near the top of countries globally in the number of weekly new COVID-19 cases. Unfortunately, Indonesia is only the latest in a succession of countries in which we have witnessed the dire chain of events in an uncontrolled COVID-19 epidemic, from Italy to Brazil to India: a preceding lack or relaxation of non-pharmaceutical social distancing measures, leading to a spike in cases that overwhelm the health care system, with oxygen shortages and the deaths of doctors and other frontline healthcare workers (most of whom at this point are presumably immunized), and the emergence of more highly infectious coronavirus variants. - Mod.LXL]

[2] Nasal involvement in COVID-19
Date: Fri 23 July 2021

The body's first encounter with SARS-CoV-2 happens in the nasopharynx. A new study in the journal Cell suggests that the first responses in this battleground help determine who will develop severe disease and who will get through with mild or no illness.

Building on work published last year [2020] identifying SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cells, a team of collaborators comprehensively mapped SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nasopharynx. They obtained samples from the nasal swabs of 35 adults with COVID-19 from April to September [2020], ranging from mildly symptomatic to critically ill. They also got swabs from 17 control subjects and 6 patients who were intubated but did not have COVID-19.

"Why some people get more sick than others has been one of the most puzzling aspects of this virus from the beginning," says Jose Ordovas-Montanes, PhD, of Boston Children's, co-senior investigator on the study with Bruce Horwitz, MD, PhD of Boston Children's, Alex K. Shalek, PhD, of MIT and Sarah Glover, DO, of the University of Mississippi. "Many studies looking for risk predictors have looked for signatures in the blood, but blood may not really be the right place to look."

To get a detailed picture of what happens in the nasopharynx, the researchers sequenced the RNA in each cell, one cell at a time. It soon became clear that the epithelial cells lining the nose and throat undergo major changes in the presence of SARS-CoV-2. There was an increase in mucus-producing secretory and goblet cells. At the same time, there was a striking loss of mature ciliated cells, which sweep the airways, together with an increase in immature ciliated cells (which were perhaps trying to compensate).

The team found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a diverse range of cell types, including immature ciliated cells and specific subtypes of secretory cells, goblet cells, and squamous cells. The infected cells, as compared to the uninfected "bystander" cells, had more genes turned on that are involved in a productive response to infection.

The key finding came when the team compared nasopharyngeal swabs from people with different severity of COVID-19 illness:

In people with mild or moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells showed increased activation of genes involved with antiviral responses -- especially genes stimulated by type I interferon, a very early alarm that rallies the broader immune system.

In people who developed severe COVID-19, requiring mechanical ventilation, antiviral responses were markedly blunted. In particular, their epithelial cells had a muted response to interferon, despite harboring high amounts of virus. At the same time, their swabs had increased numbers of macrophages and other immune cells that boost inflammatory responses.

"Everyone with severe COVID-19 had a blunted interferon response early on in their epithelial cells, and were never able to ramp up a defense," says Ordovas-Montanes. "Having the right amount of interferon at the right time could be at the crux of dealing with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses."

"It's likely that, regardless of the reason, people with a muted interferon response will be susceptible to future infections beyond COVID-19," Ordovas-Montanes says. "The question is, 'How do you make these cells more responsive?'"

Highlights
- scRNA-seq [single-cell RNA sequencing] on nasopharyngeal swabs of 58 COVID-19 and healthy participants
- SARS-CoV-2 induces ciliated cell loss & secretory and deuterosomal expansion
- Early, muted anti-viral responses in nasal epithelia in severe COVID-19
- Host-virus co-detection maps cell tropism & intrinsic responses to SARS-CoV-2

SUMMARY
SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe respiratory COVID-19. However, many individuals present with isolated upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential to constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx. Which cells SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets and how infection influences the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely understood. We performed scRNA-seq on nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 healthy and COVID-19 participants. During COVID-19, we observe expansion of secretory, loss of ciliated, and epithelial cell repopulation via deuterosomal expansion. In mild/moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells express anti-viral/interferon-responsive genes, while cells in severe COVID-19 have muted anti-viral responses despite equivalent viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ host-target cells are highly heterogenous, including developing ciliated, interferon-responsive ciliated, AZGP1high goblet, and KRT13+ "hillock"-like cells, and we identify genes associated with susceptibility, resistance, or infection response. Our study defines protective and detrimental responses to SARS-CoV-2, the direct viral targets of infection, and suggests that failed nasal epithelial anti-viral immunity may underlie and precede severe COVID-19.

[For a related press release from the collaborating institutions, see: https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-07/biom-ear072321.php. To summarize these findings perhaps too simplistically in a single sentence, it appears that COVID patients with a brisk interferon-driven antiviral response in their nasal epithelial cells have a better prognosis than those patients who instead mount an exuberant inflammatory response in their nasal macrophages and immune cells. Since early in the pandemic, clinicians caring for COVID-19 patients have observed that anosmia (loss of smell) is a distinctive feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other common respiratory viral infections (for a review, see ref. 1). Relatively early on, researchers found that ciliated airway cells that express ACE2 receptors are primary targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a gradient of infectivity from the proximal (i.e., the nasopharynx) to the distal respiratory tract (ref.2). However, the loss of smell in SARS-CoV-2 infection is not due to direct effects on the olfactory neurons themselves, but rather on airway epithelial support cells (ref.3). Of note, clinical investigators have also found that anosmia appears to be associated with less severe, rather than more severe, cases of disease (ref.4). The translational medicine question that then arises from the Ziegler et al. article above is: could a vigorous interferon response in the nasal epithelium be a mechanism of the anosmia that has been more frequently observed in mild COVID infection than in severe COVID infection? And are there any readily measurable biomarkers of nasal epithelial response that would better than the symptom of anosmia itself as a predictor of COVID disease severity? - Mod.LXL]
