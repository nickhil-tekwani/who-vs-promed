Vectors of yellow fever in Africa
---------------------------------
Further to the recent post on the outbreak of yellow fever in Sudan
(20051211.3568), it is worth expanding a little on the transmission of
yellow fever (YF) in Africa, from where about 90 per cent of cases
worldwide are reported. Enzootic transmission in forested areas (that is
the forest or jungle cycle), and sometimes adjoining rural areas, involves
viral transmission to non-human primates, such as cercopithecid monkeys, by
day-biting mosquitoes, such as _Aedes africanus_, _Ae. luteocephalus_ and
the _Ae. furcifer_ /_Ae. taylori_ complex, all of which breed in
water-filled tree holes. In more rural areas, these vectors -- and in
eastern Africa, aedine mosquitoes, such as _Ae. bromeliae__ (formerly known
as _Ae. simpsoni_) which breed in water-filled leaf axils of banana plants,
plantains and coco yams (_Colocasia_ species) -- bite monkeys and humans
and thus transfer the virus from monkeys to the human population.
Then, in the so-called urban cycle _Ae. aegypti _, a species that breeds
prolifically in man-made containers (such as water-storage pots, discarded
tin cans) in and around villages and towns, bites humans and spreads the
infection among people.
There is no information on the vectors in the present outbreak in the
Sudan, but _Ae. aegypti_ is probably involved, and it is worth remembering
that in some previous outbreaks in the Sudan (such as 1940 and 1959) _Ae.
vittatus_, a mosquito which breeds in water-filled rock pools, was strongly
suspected of being a vector. In fact, this mosquito is a proven vector of
yellow fever in some YF epidemics in Africa.

[This very informative comment not only makes up the missing part of the
2nd type of YF as mentioned in my previous post, which lacked explanation
(see also: 20051211.3568), but also further elaborates in detail the cycle
of YF transmission in Africa. - Mod.RY]
