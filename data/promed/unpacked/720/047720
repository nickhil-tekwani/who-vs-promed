The state veterinarian's office is investigating a Colorado horse that is exhibiting signs consistent with the neurologic form of equine herpes myeloencephalitis (EHV-1). Diagnostic samples are on their way to Colorado State University. "As soon as the EHV-1 test results are known we will provide updated information. The department is responding quickly to investigate, control, and mitigate this possible disease," said state veterinarian, Dr Keith Roehr. "We will continue to trace the potential contacts of this horse in order to protect Colorado's equine population."

The horse and its stable-mates have a history of travelling to events within Colorado over the last few weeks and there is a potential link to other horses that have attended the National High School Rodeo and Colorado Junior Rodeo Association events located in Henderson (26-27 Apr 2014), Eagle (2-4 May 2014), and Rocky Ford (10-11 May 2014). The Colorado state veterinarian's office is in the process of contacting all Colorado contestants that were involved in these events. "At this point, we have no knowledge of any other horses displaying signs consistent with EHV-1," said Roehr. "The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact but it can also spread through the air, contaminated equipment, clothing, and hands; this certainly highlights the importance of following basic biosecurity practices."

Important recommendations: if your horse attended any of the events above or has a direct link to a horse that attended one of these events:
- monitor its temperature twice daily and report temperatures greater than 101.5 deg F [38.6 deg C] to your veterinarian;
- isolate your horse from others if possible for 21 days past the event;
- contact your veterinarian if your horse is showing other signs of illness or if you have concerns about its health;
- limit horse-to-horse contact at equine events;
- EHV-1 can by spread on tack, grooming equipment, feed/water buckets, and people's hands or clothing. Do not share among horses or clean properly between uses.

Signs include fever, decreased coordination, nasal discharge, urine dribbling, loss of tail tone, hind limb weakness, leaning against a wall or fence to maintain balance, lethargy, and the inability to rise. While there is no cure, the symptoms of the disease may be treatable. EHV-1 is not transmissible to people; it can be a serious disease of horses that can cause respiratory, neurologic disease, and death.

[This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st sign of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
