Manitoba's sunflower crop turned out relatively poor this year
[2009], as growing conditions led to low yields and caused disease
problems in some areas.

Oilseed sunflowers in the Red River Valley and east turned out very
poor, with low yields and a lot of head rot and sclerotia, due to
excessive moisture, said Earl Schnellert of Agri-Tel Grain. Farther
west, the fields fared a little better. Confectionary seed had the
same problem, with poor crops in the central and eastern growing
regions and better quality farther west, he said.

Some sunflowers are still standing and will be harvested through the
winter. While crops did not turn out well overall, the demand is
still good said Schnellert. He didn't think the poor season would
turn farmers off from planting the crop next spring [2010], with
those growers who have sunflowers as a regular part of their rotation
keeping them there.

Statistics Canada has pegged Manitoba's 2009-10 sunflower crop at 101
900 tonnes, which would compare with 112 200 the previous year. The
tighter supplies will likely cause some processors to bring up more
US sunflower seed in order to meet their commitments.

[The problem referred to above is most likely the fungus _Sclerotinia
sclerotiorum_, although the related species _S. minor_ has been
reported to cause similar symptoms on sunflower. The pathogen causes
3 of the most important diseases of sunflower: wilt, middle stalk
rot, and head rot. Sclerotinia wilt is caused by sclerotia infecting
the roots; it is the most serious of the diseases and can destroy
whole sunflower fields. Head rot and middle stalk rot are caused by
airborne spores and are above ground diseases; they are usually
associated with wet weather periods. The presence of sclerotia
(fungal survival structures) in seed can reduce the grade and market
value of the crop.

_S. sclerotiorum_, also called white mould, is one of the most
nonspecific and successful of plant pathogens, with around 400 known
hosts worldwide. The fungus is primarily soilborne and has a complex
disease cycle. It can survive in soil as sclerotia and is also spread
by infected plant material, mechanical means, and wind-borne spores.
Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history of an
area as well as weather conditions. Disease management includes
cultural practices (such as long term crop rotation with non-hosts
and deep ploughing to minimise inoculum) and fungicide applications.
However, fungicides may not be very effective against soilborne
fungal pathogens.

In Manitoba, a previous outbreak of sclerotinia on sunflower in 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20081106.3490) may have resulted in increased
amounts of available aerial inoculum. Together with humid conditions,
this would have favoured the development of head rot in the current
sunflower crops.
