The white-tailed deer recently diagnosed with chronic wasting disease (CWD)
was one of the deer donated to the Verona Fire Department and served at its
Annual Sportsmen's Feast on Sunday, 13 Mar 2005, an Oneida County Health
Department spokesman said today.
People who consumed the venison need not worry about contracting the
disease, spokesman Ken Fanelli said.
"There's no indication whatsoever that the disease has been linked to human
illness of any kind," Fanelli.
The deer was donated before the health department knew it had the disease,
according to the health department.

Regarding CWD: Are there any precautions for handling, processing, or
eating meat from deer or elk?
To minimize the risk of transmission of any infectious diseases when
handling or processing animals, the following precautions are recommended:
--Deer or elk that are observed to be ill, or found dead, should not be
handled and should not be eaten.
--Wear rubber gloves when field-dressing carcasses.
--Wash instruments and any parts of the body exposed to animal tissues,
blood, urine, etc. thoroughly with soap and water.
-- Minimize handling brain or spinal tissues/fluids and wash hands
thoroughly with soap and water afterward if such handling occurred. If
these nervous tissues or fluids get into a fresh open break in a person's
skin or the eyes, mouth, or nose, contact the local health department to
evaluate possible rabies exposure and need for testing the animal for
other diseases.
--Request if possible that individual animals are processed individually,
without meat from other animals being added together.
--Although no CWD risk to humans has been identified from consumption of
organ meat, in general consumption of organ meat (including brain, spinal
cord, and other nervous tissue, spleen, pancreas, eyes, tonsils, lymph
nodes) may pose a greater risk of infection with a number of diseases.
Boning out meat, including removal of fat, connective tissue, and lymph
nodes, should be done with animals from states with confirmed CWD.
--Animals testing positive for CWD should not be distributed or donated for
human consumption.
--For more information about handling, processing, or eating meat from deer
or elk in other states, contact those state agriculture, wildlife, and
health agencies.
Are there any risks from deer waste or products?
Although there is no indication of human infection due to contact with deer
waste or products related to CWD-infected deer or elk, the following
general disease control precautions are recommended:
--Avoid contact with animal bodily waste material, and clean up animal
waste from areas frequented by children.
--If there is skin contact with animal waste, wash the area with soap and
water immediately.
--Deer scent products should be formulated with methods to avoid concerns
about CWD contamination.

[The index deer that was found to have Chronic Wasting Disease had no
clinical signs of the disease. NY law states that animals testing positive
may not be donated for human consumption. However, no provision is made for
the length of time between testing and consumption. There is likely not
enough freezer space to hold all the deer meat until it is tested prior to
being donated for human consumption. Currently no human disease is
associated with consumption of meat from a CWD-affected animal. However,
this does provide NY with the unique opportunity to follow the people who
consumed the meat of the diseased animal. - Mod.TG]

3 more captive deer in New York have tested positive for chronic wasting
disease.
Agricultural officials say the 3 deer belonged to the same Oneida County
herd that yielded the 1st positive last week. There are now 5 deer in New
York with confirmed cases of CWD. All of the cases come from captive herds
-- though state officials are checking to see if the deadly disease spread
into the wild. CWD is a transmissible disease that affects the brain and
central nervous system of certain deer and elk.
There is no evidence that CWD is linked to disease in humans or domestic
livestock other than deer and elk.

3 Additional Deer test positive for CWD
----------------------
Chronic Wasting Disease Update, Test Results Reveal 3 Additional Positives
from Index Herd;Public Meetings Scheduled for Friday & Saturday in Oneida
County
Test results from the 2 white-tailed deer herds confirmed positive for
Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in Oneida County that were sampled earlier
this week have revealed 3 additional deer infected with CWD.
The New York State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University
conducted the CWD tests on the twenty deer, and notified the Department of
Agriculture and Markets (DAM) of the three positive test results, late last
night.
The 3 white-tailed deer that tested positive for CWD all came from a herd,
which at the time had 18 deer. Although DAM is still investigating the
source of the infection, the prevalence of CWD in the herd provides some
indication that the disease may be a more recent infection. The prevalence
may also provide clues as to the source of infection and the risk to other
captive herds and the surrounding wild deer population.
The detection of CWD in New York was due to the State's aggressive
surveillance and monitoring program, which requires all captive deer herds
to conduct routine sampling. After confirmation of 2 positive CWD cases in
2 separate captive white-tailed deer herds in Oneida County last week, DAM
ordered the depopulation and testing of both herds in an effort to control
the possible spread of the disease in New York State.
No additional positives were found in the 2 white-tailed deer tested at the
2nd confirmed herd.
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) plans to
conduct intensive monitoring of the wild deer population surrounding both
herds to determine if CWD has spread to wild deer.
DEC will begin sampling the surrounding wild deer population next week to
determine CWD status. Input and assistance from the public and local
landowners will be essential in DEC's sampling efforts. DEC and DAM will
hold 2 public meetings to inform the public of efforts being made in Oneida
County in response to CWD.
The 1st meeting will be held Fri 8 Apr 2005, at 7 p.m. at the Oneida County
Cornell Cooperative Extension office in Oriskany. The 2nd meeting will be
held 9 Apr 2005 at 1:00 p.m. at the Westmoreland Middle School.
CWD is a transmissible disease that affects the brain and central nervous
system of certain deer and elk. There is no evidence that CWD is linked to
disease in humans or domestic livestock other than deer and elk.

[Since the herd was depopulated the 1st week of April, checking the animals
for the disease has obviously been a priority for the laboratory. Of
course, the question that remains is how many more will be found positive?
