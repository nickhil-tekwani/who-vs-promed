Notes:
Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.
1. Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national
level, probable cases are reported by all countries except the United
States of America, which is reporting suspected cases under investigation.
2. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of (See Affected Areas ).
3. One death attributed to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
occurred in a case medically transferred from Viet Nam.

list posted on 12 Apr 2003.
[C] Update 29 - Situation in China, status of scientific and clinical knowledge
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_14/en/>
Situation in China
China has today reported 109 new probable cases of SARS and 6 deaths,
bringing the cumulative total to 1418 cases and 64 deaths. The largest
number of cases occurred in Shanxi Province, where 47 new cases were
reported. In addition, 2 provinces reported SARS cases for the first time;
10 in Inner Mongolia and 3 in Fujian. [confirming both reports in the
newswire briefs in ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases
20030412.0890]
The reports indicate that the nationwide surveillance system recently
introduced by Chinese authorities is working to detect and report cases.
However, questions remain about the capacity of some provinces to cope with
the challenge of SARS.
Last week, the interim report of the WHO investigative team concluded that
the health system in Guangdong Province, where the first recognized cases
of SARS occurred in mid-November [2002], had responded well to the
outbreak. However, the report noted many concerns about the ability of
other provinces, which lack Guangdong's strong health system, to respond
promptly and effectively to SARS.
While Beijing authorities appear to have contained transmission in some
hospitals, they have not yet granted WHO experts permission to visit
military hospitals, which have been the focus of numerous rumours. WHO
staff in Beijing have expressed particular concern about the official
response to rumours and the apparent absence of rigorous contact tracing.
WHO is currently exploring ways to strengthen its support to China.
Shanghai has requested a visit from a WHO team. Teams to meet this request
and follow up on other needs in China are now being assembled by WHO and
will soon travel to China.
Status of scientific knowledge
Canadian scientists working around the clock have completed full sequencing
of the genome of the SARS virus. This is a major step forward that will
boost the development of better diagnostic tests and underpin work on a
vaccine.
The rapid sequencing of the SARS virus genome was facilitated by
collaboration with numerous other scientists, also working non-stop, at
laboratories in a WHO network set up in mid-March [2003].
A PCR test, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
has been shown to be 10 times more sensitive than previous PCR tests for
SARS. WHO experts hope that the test will be ready for roll-out by the end
of this week.
Status of clinical knowledge
Data available to WHO indicate that 96 percent of persons developing SARS
recover spontaneously. The focus now is on the roughly 4 percent who are
dying. WHO will hold a clinical teleconference on Wednesday [16 Apr 2003]
to gather international experiences in the management of SARS patients and
pool data on the results of various therapeutic regimens.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 3169 cases of SARS, with 144 deaths,
have been reported to WHO from 21 countries. This represents an increase of
213 cases and 25 deaths since the last update on Saturday.
Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sweden report their first probable cases (1
in each country) today. Japan, which had previously reported 4 probable
cases, was removed from the list as these cases were determined to have
other causes.
China, with 1418 cases and 64 deaths, remains the most seriously affected
area. Hong Kong SAR, with 1190 cases and 47 deaths, is the second most
seriously affected area. 3 of the deaths in Hong Kong over the weekend
occurred in persons under the age of 50, marking a departure from a
previously pattern in which SARS caused deaths primarily in the elderly or
in persons with pre-existing disease.

Update 30 - Severe acute respiratory syndrome 14 Apr 2003 5:00 PM
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/english/protection/warnings/sars/update30.html>
Latest Canadian Numbers on SARS
As of 14 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 287 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 13 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons
who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household
or in a health-care setting.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
(These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 14 Apr 2003.)
Ontario is reporting 100 probable and 136 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 36 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
So far, 85 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These
people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.
[B] Epidemiologic analysis (as of 13 Apr 2003)
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/eu-ae/sars20030413_e.html>
[In the epidemic curve presented on this webpage, the most recent date of
onset of illness in a case reported is 8 Apr 2003.
A review of this curve suggests that the transmission rate is slowing down
to one or 2 new cases a day since 2 Apr 2003. It is too early to state
with certainty that another generation of cases might not appear over the
coming week. *** see news brief [7][B] below for breaking news of possible
new generation of cases in the community.***
Additional data presenting the outcome of the probable cases can also be
found on this website. As of 13 Apr 2003 there were 13 deaths out of 97
reported probable cases (case fatality rate 13.7 percent) and out of a
total of 283 probable and suspected cases (case fatality rate 4.6
percent). Most of the deaths occurred in individuals with underlying
disease, and nearly all were in individuals over 70 years of age. - Mod.MPP]

A 56-year-old man died today in a hospital in Naples, 10 days after
returning from trip to Asia. It is possible that this will be the first
death attributable to SARS in Italy.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Joanne Silberner of NPR for alerting us of
this breaking news. - Mod.MPP]
According to documents obtained by CTV News that were circulated among
health officials on Sunday and Monday, SARS infections have been spreading
among "a religious group associated with the Centenary/funeral home case."
The "Centenary funeral home case" refers to one of the original SARS
infections in Toronto. A person infected with SARS was known to have
visited a local funeral home, and people who had visited that funeral home
were asked to be on the lookout for symptoms of SARS. Those cases were
apparently misdiagnosed when they originally turned up in family medical
practices and emergency rooms, rather than being screened through the SARS
clinics that had been set up in the past 2 weeks. The misdiagnoses raise
the possibility that the infections have spread further into the general
population.
"Some of these cases were initially given a diagnosis other than SARS
despite multiple visits to hospital emergency rooms," according to a Sunday
memo by Dr. Sheela Basrur, Toronto's chief medical officer. "This was due
to the apparent lack of a clear epidemiological link to a known SARS case."

<http://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1050357706691&call_pageid=968332188492&col=968793972154>
Canada's SARS crisis deepened tonight when public health officials
announced a new cluster of possible cases among a tight-knit religious
community in Toronto that are linked to the funeral of a SARS [case] 2
weeks ago. There are 10 probable and 19 suspect cases among the community,
Dr. Sheela Basur, the city's chief medical officer of health, told an
evening news conference. Basur wouldn't identify the group involved due to
privacy concerns. The cases stem from a funeral 1 Apr 2003 at the Highland
Funeral Home in east-end Toronto for someone who died of SARS.
"There are some 500 active members (of the community); of them, 29 members
have either probable or suspect SARS and an additional 2 are not members of
this group but worked closely with one of their members." All of them have
been ordered into quarantine.

[Today's global update on cumulative reported cases and numbers of new
cases reported since date of last WHO update reflects 2 days of reported
activities, as the last WHO update was 2 days ago, on 12 Apr 2003. Hence,
before one is alarmed by an apparent major increase in daily case reports,
one needs to keep this in mind. What further highlights this is the daily
updates from Hong Kong and Singapore, (both of which issued reports
yesterday) where the increase in cases reported since yesterday is 40 and 7
respectively, in contrast with the 82 and 11 respectively presented in the
WHO Global update table in [1][A]. As noted in the WHO update statement
(see [1][C], Indonesia, the Philippines and Sweden have been added to the
list of countries reporting probable cases, whereas Japan has been removed
from the list as the previously reported cases were found to have other
explainable etiologies for their SARS-like illness. A further reminder of
the challenges in relying on reports of a disease that is currently purely
based using a case definition with clinical and epidemiologic criteria
rather than a laboratory confirmed diagnosis. Hopefully, with the addition
of the more senstive PCR testing due to be released later this week, we may
be coming closer to a conclusion that the newly identified unique
coronavirus is in fact the etiologic agent of SARS, and that we will have
sensitive laboratory diagnostic testing that will allow for the additional
case reporting category of "laboratory-confirmed" cases.
Other questions that are raised in today's report is the mention of 3
deaths in younger, healthy individuals reported in Hong Kong, and the
question of what might predispose to more severe illness in this age
group. One wonders what other factors may have contributed here. A
reminder is the "historical" information that paramyxoviruses were isolated
from some of the earlier patients in Canada, Germany, and Hong Kong, and in
one of the specimens processed in the USA (there was no mention as to the
origins of the specimen). Were these isolates coincidental? Or, is it
possible that coinfection leads to a more severe progressive respiratory
disease and compromise as well as potentially leading to the observed
phenomenon of "super spreaders." In the case of coinfection with human
immunodifficiency virus (a member of the Retroviridae) and hepatitis C
virus (a member of the Flaviviridae), a more rapid progression of liver
disease to severe liver damage is observed, hence there is a precedent for
a potentiation of disease with active coinfection of 2 different viral
organisms.
The late-breaking news from Canada on the possibility of community-based
spread outside of the previously defined groups is disconcerting. As this
news just hit the newswires, and we are about to go to press, there are
many questions on this report that may be addressed in information due from
health officials later on. The story as presented in the above news brief
[7][B] suggests that there had been misdiagnosed cases that were seen by
health professionals and were not subjected to infection control measures
to try to limit the spread to additional cases. There is mention of
multiple visits to emergency rooms and to private health practitioners, so
the possibility of yet another generation of cases among those health care
personnel having seen these cases is of concern. The news brief also
mentions that the spread may involve a closed group of individuals, but
more information on this was not available at this time. We await more
information on this, preferably from official sources. - Mod.MPP]
