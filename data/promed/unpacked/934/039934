Verticillium wilt accelerated in lettuce fields during the 2009 season
in California, where _Verticillium dahliae_ 1st appeared in the
mid-1990s. In the following several years, it was most severe in 2
separate areas of the Salinas Valley and one in the Pajaro Valley.
Krishna Subbarao, University of California, reported it has been
identified thus far in at least 104 fields comprising some 2200 acres.

Two or 3 new fields became infected each year, but in 2008, the
disease was found in 13 additional fields as the clusters of infection
began to merge. In 2009, even before the fall lettuce season was
completed, it struck 33 new fields, the most ever and an almost 50
percent increase over the confirmed fields between 1995 and 2008.
Losses were complete in at least 5 fields and ranged from 5 percent to
60 percent in the others.

The outbreak has been associated with the increased acreage of
spinach, which is also a host. Symptoms of the pathogen appear when
spinach flowers and are not expressed when the crop is harvested
[pre-flowering]. Infections go unnoticed, but inoculum accumulates in
the soil and can be moved by contaminated vehicles and human traffic.
French marigolds grown for seed on the coast are another host.

"We saw unique features this year [2009]," Subbarao said. Wilt was
found in both fields which had been planted to spinach and those which
had not. Some fields showed randomly spaced and low incidence, without
the customary concentration. In a few fields, the disease reappeared
following fumigation and a crop of strawberries. Subbarao then learned
that one of the fields had been planted to a grass cover crop.

He said, "Although _V. dahliae_ is a pathogen of dicots, it is able to
colonize several grass species, including wheat, rye and barley, as
well as onions and tulips. These monocots can serve as symptomless
carriers while also dramatically increasing the soil inoculum levels."
Findings also suggested a possible airborne spread.

Subbarao said causes of the spread in lettuce might be adaptation of
the disease to lettuce, a sudden increase in population numbers, or
recurrent introductions of the pathogen into the area.

[Serious wilting diseases caused by _Verticillium dahliae_ and _V.
albo-atrum_ affect a wide range of crops and other plants. The fungi
are soil-borne and can persist in soils for many years. _V. dahliae_
wilt has emerged as a serious threat to lettuce production in
California. Symptoms include wilting and yellowing of the outer leaves
as well as brown streaks in the vascular tissue of crown and root. Two
races of the pathogen have been identified in lettuce, and weed
reservoirs as well as infected seeds have been found to be potential
sources of inoculum for this crop. Airborne spread is also suspected.
Resistant lettuce cultivars are being developed, but in the meantime,
disease management includes crop rotation and fumigation to reduce
soil-borne inoculum.

The possible involvement of monocot pathogen reservoirs, as reported
above, can be expected to make disease management considerably more
difficult.
