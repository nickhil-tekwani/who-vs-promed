A widely used animal antibiotic will be taken off the market worldwide
because it causes antibiotic resistance in humans. The antibiotic
Avoparcin, commonly used as a growth promoter in chickens, will be withdrawn
by its manufacturer, Roche Vitamins, under pressure from doctors and
governments.
The [Australian Federal Government's Joint Expert Technical Advisory
Committee on Antibiotic Resistance reported in October 1999 that
antibiotic-resistant bacteria were being spread to humans because of the
overuse of antibiotics.
Avoparcin, approved in Australia in 1982, promotes animal growth, probably
by killing some bacteria in the gut and allowing more food to be absorbed.
It is believed the company informed Federal drug authorities of their
decision to remove Avoparcin earlier this month.
Despite the withdrawal, farmers will be able to use other antibiotics.
Avoparcin has never been approved for use in North America, where
authorities deemed it carcinogenic, and was taken off the market in Europe
three years ago due to antibiotic resistance. It became a hot issue in
Australia after the European decision, with agricultural organisations
defending its use.
Farmers use an estimated 125 tonnes of Avoparcin a year.
The main concern is that Avoparcin is very similar to Vancomycin, a
powerful antibiotic reserved for serious illness in people who are not
responding to other antibiotics. There has been a rise in the number of
people developing the potentially fatal illness due Vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus (VRE), with at least 71 cases between 1994 and 1998.
