A source at the veterinary hospital in Wasit province said [Tue 21 Nov 2017] that a large number of sheep died after suffering from "Malta fever" disease, scientifically known as Brucellosis.

"The veterinary laboratory in the province has recorded a large number of sheep infected with the disease (Malta fever) during the past 2 weeks," the source said.

"Brucellosis, locally known as the "Malta fever", affects sheep and a number of livestock by means of water contamination and then can pass through milk to humans," he said.

He pointed out that "precautionary measures have been taken by means of contacts between health agencies in the province as well as the Department of the Environment, in order to reduce the transmission of these diseases to humans," stressing "the death of a large number of sheep because of this disease."

[The predominant clinical manifestation of brucellosis in sheep, caused mainly by _Brucella melitensis_, is abortion; in male animals, the bacterium may cause orchitis. Fatal cases are extremely rare, if at all. The above media report from Iraq's province Wasit (south-east of Baghdad, bordering Iran; map at https://tinyurl.com/yarr4tqc) deserves to be interpreted as a presentation of 2 separate animal health entities:

1. Undiagnosed deaths; these are yet to be thoroughly investigated by the relevant animal health agencies.
2. Brucellosis; probably causing abortions and human infections.

Both _B. abortus_ and _B. melitensis_ are endemic in Iraq. The numbers of human cases, reported to the OIE during the recent 6 years have been the following: 2011 (5006 human cases); 2012 (3668); 2013 (2009); 2014 (674); 2015 (1829); 2016 (899).

Vaccination against _Br. abortus_ (in bovines) and against _Br. melitensis_ (in sheep and goats) is countrywide applied in Iraq. In 2015, more than 1.7 million vaccine doses were applied in sheep and goats; in 2016, the reported number of vaccinations was significantly lower (275 285).
