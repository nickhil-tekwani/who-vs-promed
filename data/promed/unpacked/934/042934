[1] Current control difficulties

[In response to ProMED-mail's request for information in postings 20140513.2467609 & 20140607.2525983]:

The control of _B. melitensis_ in Israel is very complicated based on a number of reasons.

Compulsive vaccination is carried on female kids and lambs between the ages of 2 to 6 months using the attenuated Rev-1 strain of _Brucella spp_. Unfortunately not all animals are vaccinated due to various issues. The vaccination prevents abortion and not infection, so some farmers wrongly believe that vaccination will render dairy products safe for human consumption even if not pasteurized.

There is a lack of a comprehensive educational policy in the country encouraging farmers to vaccinate and warning about the dangers of unpasteurized dairy products.

Trade in untested breeding animals and mixing of flocks grazing is not under control.

There is no clear policy of removal of infected animals from flocks (slaughter or destruction) with indemnity payments nor is there a clear policy regarding penalties of introduction of animal into flocks without required testing and permits. Vaccination without removal of infected animals is not effective.

During attempted epidemiological investigations, victims of the disease and flock owners often hide information regarding the source of incriminated dairy products.

Re: Ari A Shemesh & Pablo Yagupsky. Increasing Incidence of Human Brucellosis in Southern Israel after the Cessation of a Veterinarian Control Campaign
---------------------------------------
Abstract
----------
The southern region of Israel is populated by a mostly urban Jewish majority (population: 385 200 inhabitants) and a large semi-nomadic Bedouin minority (population: 188 900) who maintain herds of sheep and goats. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the impact of the 1997 decision to discontinue a veterinarian control campaign on the epidemiology of human brucellosis in the region.

Discussion
-------------
Brucellosis appears to have been endemic to Middle East countries since ancient times affecting domesticated animals and humans as well. In modern times, rigorous control measures instituted by the Israel Ministry of Agriculture have eliminated brucellosis caused by _B. abortus_ among bovines, making the industrialized milk product supply safe. _Brucella melitensis_, however, continued to be endemic among sheep and goats, especially in nomadic Bedouin herds, and the veterinary control of the disease in this setting encountered serious logistic difficulties such as geographical dispersion of small herds, lack of shepherds' incentive to participate in the program, budgetary constraints, and illegal trade in infected animals. Although cessation of the eradication campaign in 1997 could have been justified by the steady decline in the endemic level of brucellosis observed countrywide, the present data clearly show that the disease was far from being brought to control in southern Israel. The results of the study demonstrate that, after a decline in the incidence of brucellosis in the early 2000's, starting in 2007, rates increased again and significantly exceeded the 1997 endemic level in 2012.

The relationship between the timing of the cessation of the veterinary control campaign and the epidemiological changes in the incidence of human disease in the Negev region is, therefore, not obvious. It is speculated that control measures did, in fact, decrease the prevalence of the zoonosis among domesticated animals because most infected sheep and goats were slaughtered and replaced by immunized animals, reducing the source of human contagion. Although the campaign was discontinued in 1997, its effect was still felt at the beginning of the following decade resulting in low attack rate of human infections. It is speculated that because the disease was not completely eradicated, brucellosis slowly built-up among animal herds, taking a few years before it spilled-over to the human population of the region. Close examination of the data demonstrate that the disease remained almost limited to Negev Bedouins who, although undergoing a rapid process of modernization and settlement in permanent towns, still keep goat and sheep herds and consume unpasteurized dairy products. The average incidence of brucellosis in the Bedouin community for the 11-year period (77.9 per 100 000 population) is appalling and ranks 2nd only to that reported among the population of neighboring Syria. These results indicate that countrywide data may overlook the incidence of a locally-endemic infection by diluting cases of disease amidst a large global denominator, and imply that the true magnitude of the problem should be assessed using specific data for the relevant population at risk.

The incidence rate of human brucellosis found in the present study can be considered only a minimal estimate. The study design did not include a small proportion of patients who could have been diagnosed in a few small clinical microbiology laboratories other than the CMLSUNC [Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the Soroka University Medical Center, city of Beer-Sheva].

In addition, the protean clinical manifestations of human brucellosis may mimic other infectious and non-infectious conditions and, therefore, the true nature of the symptoms and signs may be easily missed. In a previous study conducted in southern Israel, isolation of _B. melitensis_ was frequently an unexpected finding in febrile Bedouin patients in whom the disease was not suspected. In a study conducted in the region, active search for the disease among relatives of 4 index patients with brucellosis resulted in the detection of an additional 12 undiagnosed cases. A similar experience was reported in Saudi Arabia, where screening of 404 family members of 55 diagnosed cases revealed an additional 53 (13.1 percent) serologically positive individuals, of which 9 were also bacteremic.

Conclusions
-----------
Human brucellosis caused by _B. melitensis_ has reemerged as a serious public health threat to the Bedouin population of southern Israel in recent years. The Israel Ministry of Agriculture should reconsider its premature decision to terminate veterinary measures aimed to control brucellosis in domesticated animals, and implement a public education campaign to reduce human exposure to this preventable zoonotic disease.

[For additional details, including (16) references, subscribers are referred to the full text at the source URL. As apparent from the earlier postings this year [2014] (see at "See Also"), the situation has been deteriorating in other parts of the country as well. The situation in the Palestinian territories (West Bank) is, most likely, as concerning as the one observed in the Negev Bedouin population.

According to the most recent available Weekly Epidemiological Report of Israel's Ministry of Health, the tendency of increased human infection has been continuing in 2014. As of 24 May 2014 (the end of the 21st week of 2014), the accumulated number of officially reported new human cases was 210, compared to a total of 120 during the same period in 2013 (75 percent increase). The total annual figures in previous years were: 2013 - 336; 2012 - 183; 2011 - 127; 2010 - 139; 2009 - 136; 2008 - 149; 2007 - 162; 2006 - 138; 2005 - 141. The current upsurge, if it continues, may supercede the record numbers of the 80's/early 90's; spill over into other populations should not be a surprise.

Following a comment from a subscriber (referring to Saudia): "I would be more worried about the possibility of camel-mediated transmission of brucellosis than MERS CoV," we include the following report by Israeli authors (item 3). - Mod.AS]

Re: S Ben Shimol, L Dukhan, I Belmaker, S Bardenstein, D Sibirsky, C Barrett & D Greenberg. Human Brucellosis Outbreak Acquired through Camel Milk Ingestion in Southern Israel.
------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background: Human brucellosis is common in southern Israel among the semi-nomadic Bedouin, a population that consumes unpasteurized dairy products. Though camel milk ingestion is a known mechanism for brucellosis acquisition, only a few reports of sporadic cases have been published in the medical literature.

Objectives: To describe a local brucellosis outbreak in 15 extended Bedouin family members, following ingestion of infected camel milk.

Methods: Data regarding patients' clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome were collected from the hospital and the health fund clinics' computerized database. Camel's blood and milk were tested for Brucella serology and culture. Cases were defined by positive Rose Bengal test, symptoms correlating with brucellosis, and consumption of infected camel milk.

Results: 15 patients were diagnosed with acute brucellosis from March to June 2011. 60 percent of cases had serum agglutination test titers of 1:160 or higher, and 4/8 (50 percent) had positive blood culture for _Brucella melitensis_. Arthralgia and fever were the most consistent clinical manifestations. Blood and milk serology and milk culture taken from the female camel were positive for _Brucella melitensis_.

Conclusions: The treating physicians must consider the possibility of infected camel milk ingestion as the mode of infection, both in sporadic cases and in outbreaks of brucellosis.

Discussion (excerpt)
--------------------
The incidence rate of brucellosis in the Bedouin population in southern Israel was 49.4/100 000 in 2009 compared to the 1.8/100 000 nationwide incidence rate (Ministry of Health data) [later data available in item 2 above]. The high incidence rate of brucellosis in the Bedouin population could be attributed to lack of awareness regarding the nature of disease, modes of transmission and prevention methods.

Between 1998 and 2001, the local office of the Health Ministry initiated an educational community-based program aimed to increase awareness in the Bedouin population of the nature of disease, modes of transmission, and prevention methods including livestock vaccination. Evaluation of this program demonstrated a significant increase in the population's knowledge about brucellosis and its prevention methods, but there were no positive behavior changes (e.g., avoiding unpasteurized animal milk and not wearing gloves when in contact with animals).

[The camel population of Israel is, reportedly, about 11 000. Most countries in the region, which maintain much larger camel populations and where camel milk has become a popular and widely distributed commodity, may probably witness significantly higher numbers of human brucellosis cases. Information from such countries will be appreciated.

Israel managed to eradicate animal diseases such as bovine tuberculosis and _B. abortus_, and to successfully control others; efforts to control _B. melitensis_ have not been, so far, successful in spite of applied efforts, as described and discussed in item 2 above and in Ref 1. The situation in other countries, particularly in the Middle east and central Asia but also in the rest of the Mediterranean basin, in the Balkans and Mexico, is similar and in some of them even worse. Israel's experience deserves to be studied and lessons drawn for all concerned.

The financial losses caused by the disease to animal owners are much lower than the devastating damage to human health; this is an obstacle in obtaining the owners' cooperation, unless control measures, including vaccination and animal identification, are free of charge and full, immediate compensations are paid when required. Only a "one health" attitude, backed by the legal, financial and enforcement powers of national authorities would have a chance for significant achievements in the efforts to control, and -- hopefully -- eventually eradicate this long-known zoonosis from animals and consequently from humans. Some internationally accumulated lessons and guidelines may be found in refs 2 and 3.

In his preface to a recent edition of OIE's Rev Sci Tech dedicated to Brucellosis (ref 3), OIE's Director General, Bernard Vallat, wrote: "The study of zoonotic brucellosis served as a basis for some of the great early advances in epidemiology, yet the disease remains the most common chronic bacterial infection in the world. It continues to cause important medical, veterinary, socioeconomic and conservation problems, mainly because its overall burden remains underestimated and often neglected."
