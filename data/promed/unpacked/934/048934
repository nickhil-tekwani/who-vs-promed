A 10-year-old girl who was being treated for the first confirmed case
of rabies in Indiana since 1959 has died.
The girls, from northern Indiana, died Thursday morning at Riley
Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, said hospital spokeswoman Jo
Ann Klooz. She was hospitalized in early October 2006 after being
bitten in June by a rabid bat, health officials said. More than 30
relatives, friends and classmates of the girl were offered injections
to prevent the spread of the disease.
Some parents whose children attend the girl's school in the town of
Bourbon, about 25 miles south of South Bend, worried about possible
exposure since rabies can stay dormant for more than a year.
Human to human transmission of rabies is only possible through direct
contact with saliva, health officials said.
State records show Indiana's last human rabies case was in 1959, when
a Sullivan County resident died from the disease.
Rabies is a viral disease transmitted to humans and other animals
through saliva, usually in a bite. It attacks the brain and nervous
system and typically leads to death once symptoms appear.

[Rabies in humans can have a very long incubation period. In the
above case, the history of the bat bite was 4 months preceding the
onset of symptoms in the child. It is not clear from the above report
(or the original report posted in Rabies, bat, human exposure - USA
(IN) 20061018.2987) if the child had received post exposure
prophylaxis following the bat bite in June 2006. - Mods.TG/MPP]
