An outbreak of unconfirmed infection suspected to be anthrax (Differential
diagnosis African Swine Fever, Hemorrhagic Septicemia) occurred in the
teaching and research Farm of the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria,
between 27 Jun and 4 Aug 2001.
First report on 27 Jun was from 2 boars brought from another infected herd.
One was slaughtered on 29 Jun and sold. The other died 2 days later.
Outbreaks of mortalities broke out, mainly in sows, 3 days after that.
Signs observed were shivering, labored breathing, swollen upper and lower
eyelids, loss of appetite, staggering gait with apparent weakness and
uncoordination of hindlimbs, bloodstained frothy discharge from the mouth,
and bloody discharges from the mouth, nostrils, eyes, ears, anus, and vulva
which did not clot readily. Pregnant and newly farrowed sows were mostly
affected, and sows aborted. Death occurred within 1-7 days of clinical case
onset. The population at the farm reduced from 126 sows, 336 growers, and
396 weaners (total 858) as of 27 Jun, to one sow (1), 47 growers, and 101
weaners (total 149) as of 4 Aug. This was due to a combination of mortality
and culling by owners.
Similar reports came from other parts of the city.
Appreciation to Dr B.O. Olugasa of the Dept of Vet Public health and
Preventive Medicine, University of Ibadan, Ibadan and Mr A.O Akinwunmi, a
pig owner at the Farm, for providing data used in the report.

[Knowledgeable opinions on the cause of this excess mortality would be
appreciated. A stained blood smear would have readily confirmed or denied
the initial suspicion of anthrax, so I strongly suspect something else.
Also, the symptoms are not as one might expect for this disease in pigs. -
