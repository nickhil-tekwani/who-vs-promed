A 45-year-old woman died of scrub typhus in Kota district [Rajasthan state]. The incident has put the health department in Kota district on alert. The victim was a resident of Raipuria village [Madhya Pradesh state] and was admitted to a private hospital in Kota as she was suffering from fever. She remained in the hospital for 3 days undergoing treatment but her condition deteriorated and later she died.

"We have alerted the officials in the district and directed them to conduct surveys in the area where the cases are being reported," Dr R K Yadav, chief medical health officer, Kota, said. Dr Yadav further said, "So far this year [2014] from January, 9 confirmed cases of scrub typhus have already been reported."

Cases of scrub typhus were reported 1st in Alwar [Rajasthan] some 3 years ago. Since not much was known about scrub typhus, the health authorities had found it difficult to fight against the disease. Cases are now being reported from other parts of the state, especially from Bharatpur and Jaipur divisions [Rajasthan].

Scrub typhus is a disease caused by bite of a mite known as chigger. The bite leaves a black spot on the skin of the patient, who then suffers from fever. The doctors are advised by the health department to provide treatment by giving doxycycline tablets. Mostly, scrub typhus cases are reported after the monsoon.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation. Azithromycin is an alternative in children and pregnant women with scrub typhus (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1329.full).

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. Dipstick assays (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479551) have been developed that are easy to perform and do not require sophisticated equipment, making them suitable for use in rural areas where more sophisticated diagnostic tests such as the IFA may not be available. The news report above does say how the diagnosis was made in the fatal cases or in previous cases.

Kota, with a population of 1 951 014, is the 3rd largest city in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan after Jaipur and Jodhpur. Rajasthan is located in northwestern India on the border with Pakistan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan). Raipuria is a village in Bhanpura Tehsil in Mandsaur District of Madhya Pradesh State, 89 km (about 55 miles) south of Kota (http://www.onefivenine.com/india/villages/Mandsaur/Bhanpura/Raipuria). A map of this area showing the location of Bhanpura Tehsil in Mandsaur District and Kota is available at http://villagemap.in/madhya-pradesh/mandsaur/bhanpura/2329700.html. - Mod.ML
