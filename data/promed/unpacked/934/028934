Ebola outbreak kills 9 in southern Congo
----------------------------------------
The Democratic Republic of Congo's health minister says a deadly
Ebola outbreak has killed 9 people in Western Kasai province.
Augustin Mopipi said Thursday [25 Dec 2008] that analysis of samples
taken from villages in the Kampunga area confirm the outbreak.

Another Ebola outbreak occurred in the same area last year [2007],
killing at least 6 people. The Ebola virus causes a type of
hemorrhagic fever that can cause bleeding from the eyes, ears, and
other parts of the body. The illness results in death for 50 to 90
percent of cases. The last major outbreak of Ebola in Congo occurred
in 1995, killing some 250 people.

Ebola hemorrhagic fever confirmed in DRC
----------------------------------------
Blood samples from patients in the Western Kasai [Kasai Occidental]
Province in central Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] that were sent
to laboratories in Gabon have tested positive for Ebola hemorrhagic
fever [virus]. 33 people suspected of suffering from Ebola, including
9 people who have died, have been reported since [27 Nov 2008].
Additional blood and stool samples have been taken for testing.

A number of new patients suspected of being infected with the Ebola
virus are being followed up. MSF [Medecins sans Frontieres] is
closely following a patient with fever at a health center in the
village of Kaluamba.

An MSF team of 9 Ebola specialists from Kinshasa and Brussels is
currently working in Western Kasai. Logisticians are building an
isolation ward in the village of Kampungu and putting in place all
protection measures. The medical team is also providing care to all
people suspected of having the disease. There is no cure for Ebola,
so supportive and palliative care is provided.

In order to better understand the epidemic and to prevent further
propagation of the virus, the MSF team is also identifying people who
have been in contact with others infected with the Ebola virus. In
case of new deaths, it will be crucial to ensure that bodies are
buried properly, in order to prevent contamination.

An additional MSF doctor, a specialist in hemorrhagic fevers, is
departing tomorrow [26 Dec 2008] from Brussels and a health promoter
will also reinforce the team from Kinshasa. MSF is considering
dispatching additional specialists if needed.

[This newly confirmed outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever is
occurring in the same area where another outbreak of undiagnosed
illness occurred in early October (2008) but which has not since been
confirmed as an outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever. The location of
that outbreak and the current outbreak now confirmed as Ebola
haemorrhagic fever is in the same region of Kasai Occidental province
of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where a large outbreak of
Ebola haemorrhagic fever occurred in 2007.

The current outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever is occurring in the
same district of Kasai Occidental province as the 2007 outbreak of
Ebola haemorrhagic fever. A map of the province of Kasai Occidental

(and by extension the location of the current outbreak. - Mod.CP]
