Three more cases of chikungunya fever have been found in Singapore,
Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) said Saturday [2 Aug 2008]. It
has found 3 new cases of chikungunya fever, bringing the total number
of such cases to 48 so far this year [2008].

The 3 cases, involving 2 foreign workers and a local delivery driver,
are likely to be local ones, as the 3 people have not traveled out of
the country recently, said the ministry.

The 2 foreign workers are now in hospital for treatment, but the
Singaporean driver has returned to work after timely medical
treatment.

Currently, the ministry is carrying out active case detection at and
around the site in Kranji Way, and blood samples are being sent to
the country's environmental health institute for testing.

Chikungunya fever, like dengue fever, is a mosquito-borne disease,
and the best way to prevent chikungunya fever is to take
precautionary measures to prevent mosquito breeding.

The 1st case of chikungunya fever, which is characterized by sudden
onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain with
or without swelling, and low back pain, was reported in Singapore in
January this year [2008].

[Chikungunya virus transmission is continuing to smolder in
Singapore, despite active efforts to reduce the breeding sites of
_Aedes_ mosquitoes, the chikungunya virus vector. Given that
Singapore is a dynamic hub of international commerce and travel,
there is risk of spread to other countries that have significant
populations of vector mosquitoes through travel of viremic
individuals.
