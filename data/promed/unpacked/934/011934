The World Health Organization and the Chinese government said Monday [12
Jun 2006] they were setting up a center to boost cooperation in fighting
emerging infectious diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome, or
SARS, and influenza.
The WHO collaborating center will be opened Tuesday [13 Jun 2006] at the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Guangzhou, the capital of
south China's Guangdong province, a joint statement from the WHO and
China's Ministry of Health said.
The center will serve as a liaison between the WHO and the Guangdong
disease control facility with the aim of increasing information-sharing
between China and the rest of the world, the statement said.
SARS 1st emerged in Guangdong and killed nearly 800 people worldwide before
subsiding in 2003. China's south has been the breeding ground for diseases
that jump between animals and humans, because they often live in close
proximity.
The statement said the collaborating center will help carry out
epidemiological research, including studies into the animal origins of SARS
and the transmission of influenza between humans and animals.
Avian influenza, or bird flu, has killed 124 people worldwide, including 12
in China.
No new human cases of bird flu have been reported in a more than a month,
the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday [12 Jun 2006], quoting Health
Ministry spokesman Mao Qun'an, who also said the government was stepping up
prevention measures.
"We are still keeping a close eye on bird flu and have strengthened
scientific research and nationwide surveillance," Mao said.
Scientists fear the H5N1 bird flu virus will mutate into a highly
contagious form that can be spread between humans, possibly sparking a
global pandemic. So far, most human cases have been linked to infected birds.
The WHO collaborating center in China aims to become a training base for
other southern Chinese provinces as well as countries in the region, the
statement said.
"We know from SARS and avian influenza that what happens in one country
affects another," Shigeru Omi, WHO regional director for the western
pacific, was quoted as saying in the statement. "China is helping WHO and
the world implement lessons learnt from recent emerging infectious diseases."

[We wish the initiative a successful launch and fare. If the new
collaborating center is to deal, as stated, in studies into the animal
origins of SARS and the transmission of influenza between humans and
animals, the input of animal-health experts might be anticipated. - Mod.AS]
