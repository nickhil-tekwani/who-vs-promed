Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) is a major infectious disease in swine. PRRSv infections in Hungary, with about 4 million slaughter pigs and 170 000 breeding sows, [are estimated] to cost roughly 5 billion Hungarian forint (about USD 11.47 million) per year.

In 2013, the Pig and Food Chain Safety Strategy of the Hungarian government highlighted the need to eradicate PRRS virus. Following the successful implementation of the Aujeszky's Disease eradication program, it was thought that elimination of PRRS in Hungary would facilitate the growth of market opportunities.

The legal background of the eradication program was set out in January 2014. The programme, with state involvement, was approved by the competent committee of the European Union. There are 19 counties and 1 additional unit, the capital Budapest in Hungary. These are grouped into 7 EU regions. The eradication had to be reached at a regional level. In each of those regional units, PRRS needed to be eradicated from the entire pig population within a specified period.

A national regulation stipulated that pigs be [recognised as being infected] by PRRS, if they:
- Show characteristic clinical signs or post-mortem lesions, and the presence of PRRSv is conﬁrmed by virological examination;
- Have detectable PRRSv or its genome;
- Show signs of the disease and are kept in breeding or fattening pig herds. The district authority has established the presence of the disease in these herds;
- Have been seropositive as conﬁrmed by 2 different types of serological tests from the same sample.

[During] the 1st phase of the plan, [namely] the surveillance phase, [the following] 3 types of pig farms were identified, each [type] receiving [its] own regime as to how the eradication should take place:
1. Backyard farms
The authority ordered depopulation of the herds, with state compensation, but without the need for repopulation.

2. Large-scale fattening units
At the early stage of the eradication plan, after sending the pigs to slaughter, premises had to be cleaned and disinfected. Only PRRS-free animals were allowed to be [introduced in the] population.

3. Large-scale breeding swine herds
Managers of large-scale breeding swine herds had complete freedom to decide whether they carried out the eradication of PRRSv by complete depopulation-repopulation; herd closure, or test and removal. They could also apply more stringent site management methods; rationalisation of infection chain interruption; or the introduction of systematic laboratory testing processes. The criterion was to ﬁnd an optimal method suited to the particular technological processes of the swine herd. It had to lead to a PRRSv-free status with high probability within a certain time period defined by a competent authority.

In principle, breeding stocks could be vaccinated without any time limit. Laboratory methods (ELISA, PCR) in any age group had to prove the progeny was free from PRRSv. Vaccination during the fattening process (including lactation, nursery, fattening) was not allowed in those farms. Therefore, the tests were not allowed to show seropositivity in the progeny. All animals had to be free from PRRSv, [including from] the vaccine virus.

Eradication phase
The 2nd stage, the eradication phase of the process began in November 2017. The decision banned the introduction of [pigs from] non-PRRS-free fattening herds into Hungary. Only PRRS-free nursery pigs could be used for fattening. In practice, that meant that:
- Only pigs from PRRS-free farms could be used for fattening in Hungary;
- If any diagnostic test after 48 hours of arrival or 60 days of quarantine gave a positive [test] result, the producer had to carry out a 2nd test. If the result was still positive, the producer had to sell the stock for slaughter within 15 days or place it outside Hungary;
- From 2019, the PRRS-free status of the herd of origin had to be certified by a local official veterinary authority.

Results
Backyard farms
During the surveillance phase, between 2012 and 2013, backyard settlements in Hungary kept pigs in nearly 60% of the cases. Of the examined backyards, surveillance teams found PRRS-seropositive individuals in nearly 4% in both years [2012/13]. Following the eradication decree seropositive animals were culled. This meant that on 31 Dec 2015, the PRRS-free status of small-scale Hungarian swine herds was a fact. PRRS monitoring programs in each following year at small-scale swine operations conformed that free status.

No samples originating from breeding sows tested PCR positive. The PRRSv PCR positivity was observed in small-scale herds when irregular animal transport without veterinary certification was carried out or when infected nursery pigs stood in small units for fattening purposes.

Large-scale breeding farms
Of the 470 large-scale breeding farms in Hungary, 345 were classified as PRRSv-free (73%). 125 (27%) were classified as PRRSv-infected at the beginning of 2014. The total number of sows in those 470 farms was 186 404. 68 226 (37%) sows were in infected farms.

The average number of sows in the herds was 396; the average sow number in non-infected and infected farms was 343 and 546, respectively. With the exception of 20 farms, all were of the farrow-to-finish type. During the eradication process, 40 large-scale breeding farms that were initially free from PRRSv became infected. So, altogether, 165 large-scale breeding farms had to create their own eradication plans. Of these, 94 (69 111 sows) eradicated the virus by the depopulation-repopulation method. 6 farms reached the Vaccinated Free (VF) status. Others, that were seronegative during certification, turned to producing fatteners or left the swine business altogether.

Based on the similarity network analysis, the team was able to determine the reason of the infection of the above-mentioned 40 large-scale pig farms. About 40% of them became PRRSv-infected through imported nursery pigs. In almost 50% of cases, the [infection ocurred due to] vehicle transport.

In February 2022, the eradication committee declared that 99% of large-scale breeding farms were free from PRRSv.

Large-scale fattening farms
In 2015, 188 (61.2%) out of 307 large-scale fattening farms registered by the Hungarian veterinary authorities kept PRRS-positive animals. Of the total number of fattening places on these farms, 63.9% were PRRS-positive. At national level, there was no significant difference in the number of infected and infection-free stocks per holding. In 2013, 46% of pigs coming to Hungary as fatteners originated from the Netherlands. 39% came from Germany and 12% from Slovakia. The rest arrived from Denmark, Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

In 2016, the Netherlands accounted for 46%, Germany for 33%, Denmark for 10% and Slovakia for 6% of imports of fatteners to Hungary. PRRS eradication and the new rules regarding importation for large-scale fattening units induced major changes for countries exporting pigs to Hungary: pigs imported from the Netherlands decreased significantly and at the same time those from Denmark, Czech Republic and Slovakia increased.

Current state of PRRS eradication in fatteners:
At the end of 2021, every large-scale fattening swine unit in Hungary was PRRSv-free. The eradication committee feels that the biggest threat to Hungarian swine units maintaining their PRRSv-free status is insufficient import checks of nursery pigs. The committee believes in the effectiveness of the rules implemented [since] 2017, even tightened ones, when Hungary requested an official certificate of the herd of origin of nursery pigs confirming its PRRS-free status.

Costs of eradicating PRRS in Hungary:
Between 2014 and 2022, about 600 to 800 million Hungarian forint (about USD 1.382 to 1.843 million) per year was available for compensation. The state calculated the total investment at 7 billion Hungarian forint (about 16.124 million USD). It spent significant amounts on depopulation-repopulation. The program needed a total of 80 000 to 100 000 lab tests, both for small-scale and large-scale swine herds.

Apart from eradicating PRRSv, the general biosecurity status of the farms has gone up significantly during the program. This development will also have a positive effect on the reduction of antibiotic usage. This effect has not yet been subject to research.

[The above media-sourced article, authored by István Szabó PhD, DVM, National PRRS Eradication Committee of Hungary, is an 'abridged, edited and approved' version of a paper presented at the European Symposium for Porcine Health Management (ESPHM), held in Budapest, Hungary, 11-13 May 2022. As stated, the Co-authors of the said paper are Imre Nemes, Lajos Bognár, Tamás Abonyi, Zsolt Terjék, Tamás Molnár and Ádám Bálint.

The information in the above 2022 presentation, addressing the eradication of PRRS from all (7) Hungary's 'regions', is complementary to information included in a research paper published in November 2020, addressing the earlier achieved eradication within the program. (Citation: Szabo I., Bognar L., Molnar T. et al. PRRS eradication from swine farms in five regions of Hungary. Acta Veterinaria Hungarica 68 (2020) 3, 257-262. DOI:10.1556/004.2020.00043 (free access)). According to the detailed 2020 paper, by applying the territorial principle and the most appropriate eradication methods it was possible to achieve PRRS-free status of large-scale breeding herds in large geographical areas despite the high density of farrow-to-finish pig farms. In addition, the new WOAH regulation on PRRS (see further) "provided a good opportunity to achieve PRRSV-free status, 'vaccinated free' (VF) in the short term". The authors indicated: "However, in the long term, the exact process suitable for achieving complete PRRSV freedom of breeding herds with VF status still needs to be developed, with special regard to removing the previously infected breeding sows as soon as possible, since they pose a significant risk of reinfection leading to the loss of PRRS-free status".

At its 85th General Meeting in May 2017, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) approved the international PRRS regulations in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. According to the Code's article 15.3.3, "a country, zone or compartment may be considered free from PRRS when the following conditions are met:
1) PRRS is a notifiable disease in the entire country;
2) an early warning system is in place;
3) surveillance in accordance with Articles 15.3.13. to 15.3.16. has been in place for at least 12 months;
4) there has been no occurrence of infection with PRRSV in domestic and captive wild pigs during the past 12 months;
5) no vaccination against PRRS with inactivated vaccines has been carried out during the past 12 months;
6) no vaccination against PRRS with modified live vaccines has been carried out during the past 24 months;
7) pigs and pig commodities are imported or introduced in accordance with Articles 15.3.5. to 15.3.12."

WOAH's Code chapter 15.3 is available at https://www.woah.org/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/current/chapitre_prrs.pdf.

Countries such as Sweden, Norway and Switzerland have successfully controlled the virus through total depopulation/repopulation strategies. Other European countries such as Denmark control PRRS with a combination of biosecurity measures and immunisation strategies.

According to WOAH Animal Diseases portal, PRRS is now found in most areas of the world where pigs are raised. Besides Europe and North America, it was identified in China in 1995 and is present in Japan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Korea among other countries in Asia. Australia, New Zealand, several European countries, parts of Africa and India are currently free of the disease.
