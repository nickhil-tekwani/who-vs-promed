No strange disease in Mityana, says Ministry of Health
------------------------------------------------------
Experts from the Ministry of Health in Kampala have announced today
[7 Apr 2010] that there is no strange disease in Mityana district.

Some media reports in Kampala last week reported that the Ministry of
Health was investigating a strange disease that reportedly hit the
district of Mityana. Dr. Joseph Wamala of the Ministry of Health
stated that they had investigated the situation and found out that
the reports were false.

Dr. Wamala said there is no disease that has symptoms similar to that
of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Mityana. Wamala warned alarmists
against giving false news to media organisations.
