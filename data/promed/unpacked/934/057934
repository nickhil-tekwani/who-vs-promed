[C] Update 14 - Update on cases and countries 29 Mar 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_03_29/en/>


As of 29 Mar 2003, a cumulative total of 1550 cases and 54 deaths have been
reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 65 cases and one
death compared with the previous day.

WHO infectious disease specialist, Dr Carlo Urbani, the first WHO officer
to identify the outbreak of this new disease and treat the earliest cases
in Hanoi, died of SARS today in Thailand, accounting for the additional death.

The number of cases in Viet Nam remained at 58 for the sixth day in a row,
indicating that the outbreak in Hanoi is well-controlled.

The largest increases occurred in Hong Kong SAR China, with 45 new cases,
and Canada, with 8 new cases. The United States of America reported 8
additional suspect or probable cases.

[D] Dr. Carlo Urbani of the World Health Organisation dies of SARS 29 Mar 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/urbani/en/>

Dr. Carlo Urbani, an expert on communicable diseases, died today of SARS.
Dr. Urbani, worked in public health programs in Cambodia, Laos and Viet
Nam. He was based in Hanoi, Viet Nam. Dr. Urbani was 46.

Dr. Urbani was the first WHO officer to identify the outbreak of this new
disease, in an American businessman who had been admitted to a hospital in
Hanoi. Because of his early detection of the disease, global surveillance
was heightened and many new cases have been identified and isolated before
they infected hospital staff. In Hanoi, the SARS outbreak appears to be
coming under control.

Carlo was a wonderful human being and we are all devastated, said Pascale
Brudon, the World Health Representative in Viet Nam. He was very much a
doctor, his first goal was to help people. Carlo was the one who very
quickly saw that this was something very strange. When people became very
concerned in the hospital, he was there everyday, collecting samples,
talking to the staff and strengthening infection control procedures.

Dr. Urbani was married and the father of 3 children.

Dr. Urbani received his medical degree from the University of Ancona,
Italy, and did post-graduate work in malaria and medical parasitology. He
was an expert in the parasitic diseases of schoolchildren. He was also a
president of Médecins Sans Frontières-Italy.

Carlo Urbanis death saddens us all deeply at WHO, said Dr. Gro Harlem
Brundtland, WHOs Director-General. His life reminds us again of our true
work in public health. Today, we should all pause for a moment and remember
the life of this outstanding physician.

[We are very sorry to learn of Dr. Urbani's death. A very sobering
occurrence. - Mod.MPP]

SARS - Situation Update

As of 29 Mar 2003, a total of 89 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health. The 3 additional patients, who are family members of
SARS cases, are still traced back to the initial 3 index cases. This brings
the total number of family members, friends or close contacts infected by
SARS to 44, and the total number of hospital staff infected by SARS to 41.
These 85 cases are all linked to the first 3 index cases. The number of
infected children still remains at 3.

To date, 28 patients have been discharged from hospital, 2 have died and
the remaining 59 patients are hospitalised. All the patients are stable
except for 13 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth
index case.

The fourth imported case reported yesterday is a 29 year old Chinese female
who travelled to Hong Kong on 14 Mar 2003 and then to Beijing on 15 Mar
2003. While in Beijing, she became ill on 19 Mar 2003. She arrived back in
Singapore on Southern China Airlines CZ 355 at Terminal 1, Changi Airport
on 26 Mar 2003 at 5.38 AM. Accompanied by her mother, she took a taxi from
the airport to the Accident & Emergency Department, Singapore General
Hospital. From there, she was transferred by ambulance and admitted to Tan
Tock Seng Hospital.

Of the 49 passengers on board CZ 355, 31 (including the case) have been
traced. They are all well. Home Quarantine Orders are being issued. The 9
crew members of CZ355 returned to China on 26 Mar 2003. The Southern China
Airlines has taken action to bar them from flights for 10 days. The names
of the remaining 18 passengers who we have still been unable to locate [can
be found on the website at:
<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5720> - Mod.MPP] The
Ministry urges these persons or anyone who knows their whereabouts and the
identity of the taxi driver to call 91788389 with the information.

[A] CDC Extends SARS Travel Advisory; Offers Interim Infection Control Guidance
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r030329.htm>

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today extended its
travel advisory for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) to include all
of mainland China as well as Hanoi, Vietnam and Singapore. The previous CDC
travel advisory was for only Hong Kong and Guangdong Province, People's
Republic of China and Hanoi, Vietnam.

CDC advises that people planning elective or non-essential travel to
mainland China and Hong Kong; Singapore; and Hanoi, Vietnam may wish to
postpone their trips until further notice. CDC has been working closely
with the World Health Organization (WHO) to investigate cases of SARS. At
this time CDC is not advising against travel to or from Canada because
there is not evidence of widespread community transmission.

CDC officials are meeting planes, cargo ships and cruise ships coming
either directly or indirectly to the United States from China, Singapore
and Vietnam and distributing health alert cards
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/travel_alert.htm>) to disembarking
passengers. In addition officials are assessing passengers returning from
those areas for symptoms of SARS.

CDC is also issuing guidance for patients with suspected SARS designed to
prevent transmission of the illness to their family members and other close
contacts. Health care officials are not certain how long a patient with
SARS may be contagious to people with whom they have close contact.

CDC recommends the following infection control measures for suspected
patients with SARS in household or other residential settings:

Infection control precautions should be continued for SARS patients for 10
days after respiratory symptoms and fever are gone. SARS patients should
limit interactions outside the home and should not go to work, school,
out-of-home day care, or other public areas during the 10 day period;

During this 10 day period, all members of the household with a SARS patient
should carefully follow recommendations for hand hygiene, such as frequent
hand washing or the use of alcohol-based rubs;

Each patient with SARS should cover his or her mouth and nose with a tissue
before sneezing or coughing. If possible, a person recovering from SARS
should wear a surgical mask during close contact with uninfected persons.
If the patient is unable to wear a surgical mask, other persons in the home
should wear masks when in close contact with the patient;

Disposable gloves should be considered for any contact with body fluids
from a SARS patient. However, immediately after activities involving
contact with body fluids, gloves should be removed and discarded and hands
should be washed. Gloves should not be reused, and are not intended to
replace proper hand hygiene.

SARS patients should avoid sharing eating utensils, towels and bedding with
other members of the household, although these items can be used by others
after routine cleaning such as washing or laundering with soap and hot water;

Other members of the household need not restrict their outside activities
unless they develop symptoms of SARS such as a fever or respiratory illness.

[B] Excerpts from Update Telebriefing Conference 29 Mar 2003
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030329.htm>

We continue to regard the new coronavirus as the leading hypothesis for the
etiology of this condition. The evidence is mounting from a number of
international laboratories, that this is indeed the case; but we are also
exploring other potential viruses as are our collaborators. A number of
things are in progress, including sequencing of the whole virus genome.

We recognize that the disease is still primarily limited to travelers, to
health care personnel who have taken care of SARS patients, and to close
contact with SARS patients. The affected travelers are those who have been
in Hong Kong, in Hanoi, in Singapore, and in mainland China, for the most part.

We believe, based on the investigations so far, that the major mode of
transmission is through droplet spread when an infected person coughs or
sneezes and droplets are spread to a nearby contact. But we are concerned
about the possibility of airborne transmission across broader areas and
also the possibility that objects that become contaminated in the
environment could serve as modes of spread. Coronaviruses can survive in
the environment for up to 2 or 3 hours ,and so it's possible that a
contaminated object could serve as a vehicle for transfer to someone else.

For the people who are living in the household with the SARS patients, and
who are otherwise well, there is no reason to limit activities at this
point in time. The experience in the United States has not demonstrated
spread of SARS from household contacts into the community and so we are not
advising any restrictions on the activity of contacts at this point in
time. However, it's very important that contacts with SARS patients be
alert to the earliest symptom of a respiratory illness. If they have any
symptoms suggestive of an impending illness, they should contact a medical
provider, alert them that they are a SARS contact, so that the health care
system can advise them where to come and get evaluation, and prepare the
delivery system to implement the appropriate infection control precautions
so that others are not exposed in the health care setting.

We also are updating our guidance to travelers. The travelers at risk for
SARS are those who have been in mainland China, in Hong Kong, in Hanoi and
in Singapore. These travel alerts do not include passengers coming in from
Canada. The epidemiology of the SARS in Canada is very different and there
is not a risk from incoming travelers at this point in time. WHO is not
issuing any travel restrictions. We are not issuing any travel restrictions
either, but WHO has also implemented procedures for screening passengers
before they leave the country of SARS origin.

Of the 62 cases under investigation [in the USA], 2 of those cases are in
health care workers and there have been no further signs of spread in that
particular cluster. 5 cases have been in household contact and the rest of
the cases have all been in travelers coming in from SARS areas. We are not
experiencing any sign of community transmission at this point in time.

In response to a question related to Hong Kong health officials reporting
suspect cases from an apartment complex: Information from Hong Kong does
suggest that in at least one apartment complex there has been spread. [It
hasn't been identified as yet] to what extent the individuals in that
apartment have had face to face contact with each other, to what extent
they might have contacted contaminated environments in that facility or to
what extent airborne transmission could play a role.

In response to a question on other modes of transmission and guidance for
airlines: Preliminary guidance on appropriate means for disinfection of
commercial aircraft as well as very specific and more focused guidance for
disinfection of an aircraft that might be used in a medical evacuation of a
high-risk or critically-ill patient [have been issued].

In response to a question re: treatment guidelines: [There is] no evidence
right now, that any specific anti-viral therapy, or steroid treatment, or
other agents that are targeting this virus, are of any benefit to patients.

In response to questions re: concern about community spread in the USA: We
recognize that there are at least some patients with SARS that are
extremely efficient transmitters. For example, in Hanoi where there was one
patient who was a source for health care worker transmission and
approximately 56 percent of the health care [workers] who had direct
contact with the patient appeared to have acquired SARS.

In response to a question on evidence of coronavirus as the etiology:
First, we have isolated the coronavirus from 2 patients, here, in the USA
and elsewhere additional isolations are reported. We are using PCR or
polymerase chain reaction technology to identify very specific pieces of
the coronavirus in the secretions and fluids from many of the case
patients. We have developed an antibody assay which detects antibodies to
this new coronavirus with a high degree of specificity, some of the
patients who have negative antibody tests at the beginning of their
illness, subsequently, in paired serum have demonstrated development of
antibody within days after their infection occurred. They are developing an
immunologic reaction to this new coronavirus, strong evidence of infection.

We now have 2 antibody tests that look quite promising and seem to be
reproducible in different laboratories, and we're working to transfer
diagnostic testing capacity to public health laboratories around the
country, so that before too long, tests will be available much more locally.

Laboratories in at least 7 other countries now have evidence for coronavirus.

In response to a question on the period of infectivity of cases: One of the
important studies going on is to look at passengers who traveled in
airplanes with SARS patients, we have 3 separate cohorts of passengers who
traveled on the same plane with someone we knew was incubating SARS or had
SARS during their travel experience. So far, those studies have not
identified evidence of transmission before people become sick but the
numbers are small and we can't draw any conclusions at this point in time.

Update 14 - SARS 29 Mar 2003 5:00 PM

As of 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 37 cases of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario, British Columbia and
Manitoba. There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The information
contained in this update is based on the best available information Health
Canada has at this time.

The details of the cases to date are as follows:

Ontario: 35 total cases. All cases have occurred in persons who have
traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household or in a
health-care setting.

British Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after
returning from travel in southeast Asia.

Manitoba: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after returning from
travel in southeast Asia.

Due to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in
non-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; the
People's Republic of China including the Hong Kong SAR; and Singapore,
Health Canada recommends that persons planning to travel to these areas
should defer all travel until further notice. Health Canada also recommends
alternate routing be considered, when possible, if a traveller is
transiting through the People's Republic of China including the Hong Kong
SAR; City of Hanoi, Vietnam; or Singapore. Health Canada is aware that
health authorities in these affected areas are making concerted efforts to
contain the spread of SARS in their populations. Given the uncertainties of
the current situation, Health Canada believes it is prudent to await the
outcome of national and international control measures before undertaking
travel to these destinations.

On 29 Mar 2003, Health Canada deployed 2 additional staff to assist Toronto
Public Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of
SARS cases. This now brings the total number of Health Canada staff
assisting in Ontario to 7. The department has also provided guidelines for
infection control and recommendations on actions for public health settings.

On 27 Mar 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended new
measures, related to international travel aimed at reducing the risk of
further international spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
The measures proposed by WHO on the screening of passengers presenting for
international travel are under active consideration by Health
Canada. Health Canada has discussed this issue with the local airport
authority in Toronto and we are putting together a plan. Health Canada is
hoping to have something in place in Toronto over the course of the weekend.

It is important to note that airlines operating international flights in
and out of Canada have been carrying out long-standing procedures to
prevent sick passengers from getting on airplanes.

[ProMED-mail regrets this error in transcription and welcomes
the opportunity to set the record straight. - Mod.CP]

[Today's reports represent an increase in 65 cases and one death since
yesterday's report, of which there are 45 new cases reported in Hong
Kong. Due to a time zone difference, the WHO statistics for the USA
represent the number of cases reported yesterday (28 Mar 2003), whereas in
the CDC update presented in [4] there is an increase in 3 cases in the
USA. With the exception of Hong Kong and mainland China, it still appears
as though transmission is via close contact with active cases of SARS
either in the health care setting or household contacts. Information on
the epidemiology of the cases in mainland China is still pending, and in
Hong Kong there appears to be transmission in a housing complex, but the
degree of contact between the cases is still under study.
