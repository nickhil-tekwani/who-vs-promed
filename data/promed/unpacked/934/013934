Eleven human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected people in the
Oshskaya region have contracted the infection from an infant. This
statement was released by the Minister of Health during a press
conference. The minister said that the infant had undergone a period
of prolonged treatment in the Nookatskaya Regional Hospital and in
Oshskaya City Hospital. The child's HIV infection was not recognized
in these hospitals and was only diagnosed when the child was
transferred to the National Centre for Pediatrics and Surgery in
Bishkek, the capital city of the Republic.
A special committee went to the Oshskaya region to investigate the
case, and they found that of 761 children who had contact with the
HIV-infected infant, 7 had contracted HIV infection. In addition, a
doctor was identified who [had contracted infection] from the
children, and another child was infected from the mother during delivery.

[It is probable that the transmission of infection was due to re-use
of disposable equipment or, less likely, transfusion of contaminated
blood. Not all of the 11 cases are accounted for in this report.
Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
