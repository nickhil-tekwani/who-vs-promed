Health officials in Monmouth County have confirmed one case of mumps and are looking into more than 2 dozen others. County public health coordinator Michael Meddis said Friday [6 Sep 2013] that lab results were positive for one case and that 26 other reported cases were still under investigation. Meddis says the reported cases are all adults with the exception of one pre-school aged child.

Health officials say most individuals have either been patrons or employees of D'Jais Bar and Grill in Belmar. D'Jais will be closed for the weekend and has carried out cleaning and sanitizing recommendations from the Health Department.

Mumps-like symptoms include the swelling of salivary glands along with fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Officials are trying to determine the possible source of infection.

[According to another version of this report, mumps virus infection can be spread by respiratory secretions and saliva (like kissing or yelling in someone's face) and by sharing drinks or making contact with unclean surfaces with respiratory secretions on them, circumstances that may have pertained at this particular club.

Nonetheless, it is highly unusual for an outbreak of mumps virus infection to originate at one particular Bar/Grill, although mumps outbreaks have occasionally been associated with clubs involving contact sports. Further information is awaited to determine whether this is an isolated event or a major outbreak of disease. - Mod.CP
