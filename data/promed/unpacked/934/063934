----------------------------------------------------------------------
In the recent update of the safety of using Tamiflu during pregnancy,
I spotted an error. It was incorrectly stated that Tamiflu and
Relenza were oral and intranasal formulations of oseltamivir
respectively. In fact, Relenza is an inhaled (but not intranasal)
formulation of zanamivir -- an entirely different neuraminidase
inhibitor.

The distinction is important on 2 counts: Relenza is difficult to
administer to small children and to very sick patients who are
intubated, as it requires the patient inhale the drug. Also, the
2008-2009 seasonal H1N1 influenza (not the H1N1 swine-origin
influenza) has been nearly 100 percent resistant to oseltamivir in
the United States, but sensitive to zanamivir.

In the approaching winter season, this will pose issues with
treatment -- both empiric and targeted. H1N1 (human) will likely
require amantadine or zanamivir treatment, whereas H1N1 (swine
origin) will hopefully remain susceptible to oseltamivir, and
influenza B is inherently resistant to amantadine so will require
oseltamivir or zanamivir. H3N2 has been resistant to amantadine in
the recent past as well. The only common drug is zanamivir, so for
empiric treatment of young children or very sick patients,
combination therapy will likely be the only feasible approach. This
was the recommendation for the 2008-2009 season, but will have
ramifications for drug supply in the event of a widespread epidemic
with potentially limited vaccine control.

Rapid diagnostics will help with narrowing drug coverage but are not
available in many locations and even multiplex PCR can take several
days.

[ProMED-mail thanks Nicholas Bennett and also Stephen D Shafran
(University of Alberta) and others who have pointed out the error in
a Moderator's comment that Tamiflu and Relenza are proprietary
preparations of the same neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir. In fact
Tamiflu is the proprietary name for oseltamivir, as stated, but
Relenza is the proprietary name for a different neuraminidase
inhibitor called zanamivir. ProMED-mail regrets propagating this
error.

Nicholas Bennett has provided some useful additional information and
guidance regarding the use of these 2 neuraminidase inhibitors in
clinical practice. - Mod.CP]
