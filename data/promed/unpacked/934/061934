External Situation Report 15: 12 July 2018
------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Equateur Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Until the outbreak is declared over, intensive surveillance, survivor monitoring and other response activities are ongoing to prevent, promptly detect and respond to potential resurgences of the virus.

No new laboratory-confirmed EVD cases have been detected since the last case developed symptoms on [Sat 2 Jun 2018] (Figure 1). Since the beginning of the outbreak (on Wed 4 Apr 2018), a total of 38 laboratory confirmed and 15 probable cases (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing) have been reported. Of these 53 cases, 29 died, giving a case fatality ratio of 54.7 percent. Twenty-eight (53 percent) cases were from Iboko, 21 (40 percent) from Bikoro and 4 (8 percent) from Wangata health zones (Table 1 and Figure 2). Five healthcare workers were affected, of which 2 died.

An additional 11 suspected EVD cases have been reported since our last report on 3 Jul 2018 (External Situation report 14). As of 9 Jul, 5 suspected cases are currently awaiting laboratory results. All other previously reported suspected cases have tested negative.

The last surviving confirmed EVD case was discharged from an Ebola treatment centre (ETC), following 2 negative tests on serial laboratory specimens, on [Thu 12 Jun 2018]. Before the outbreak can be declared over, a period of 42 days (2 incubation periods) following the last possible exposure to a confirmed case must elapse without any new confirmed cases being detected.

[2] DRC: Health workers

Miriam Alia, an MSF vaccination expert, has just returned from Equateur province in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Miriam worked as a medical referent in the area of Itipo, the epicentre of the recent outbreak. She explains how MSF took part in the ring vaccination against the disease and tells of her personal experience working with Congolese health workers.

For 3 weeks I was part of the MSF medical team responding to the Ebola epidemic in Itipo, a remote area south of the city of Mbandaka in DRC, where a number of people had tested positive for Ebola. While caring for patients in the treatment centres we had set up in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, we implemented the other 'pillars' of an Ebola response. For instance, we were finding people who had been in touch with Ebola patients - 'patient contacts' - and informing communities about the disease and how to avoid getting infected.

A key component of the response is to make sure that the health system continues to function properly during the outbreak. That means health workers are protected and know how to identify suspected cases. If this is in place, we have a good chance to slow down and then stop the spread of the disease, and to avoid deaths linked to other medical conditions such as malaria. Often health staff can be afraid of treating patients due to the risk of infection from Ebola.

This year [2018] in DRC we had an additional tool to use against Ebola: an investigational vaccine. In Itipo, MSF, in partnership with the World Health Organization and the Congolese Ministry of Health, was in charge of vaccinating those most at risk of contracting the virus. This included not only the contacts of confirmed Ebola patients and the contacts of those contacts, but also the people on the frontline of the fight against Ebola, i.e. healthcare workers, traditional healers, local religious leaders and motorbike taxi drivers. Sadly, the infection of healthcare workers is something that we see in many outbreaks of Ebola, as they are obviously most at risk of catching the disease when sick people come to them for help. It was great to be able to offer them the vaccine, and in turn some protection.

This vaccine against Ebola had already been used in clinical trials in West Africa during the 2014--2016 outbreak. But this was in Sierra Leone, and in Conakry, the large Guinean capital city. In Itipo this year [2018], we faced another kind of challenge: the area we were covering was made up of 8 health zones, including 46 health centres and health posts, many of them located in remote villages. To reach them and vaccinate their health staff, we had to use motorbikes, pirogues (canoes) and sometimes go on foot for several kilometres through the forest.

Most of the health staff we vaccinated were nurses. Some of them were working completely alone in remote health posts. Others worked in groups of 3 or 4 in larger health centres. We didn't have to convince them to be vaccinated. They were quite afraid of the disease and knew very well that the head nurse from Itipo had just died of Ebola, along with 20 other people in the area.

While we are confident that the vaccine works and had seen very promising data from other trials, we had to be sure to explain to the staff that they needed to continue caring for suspected Ebola patients with all the necessary precautions. They needed to use the protective material that we provided them with, and be aware that it takes 5 -- 10 days after vaccination for the immune system to be activated and provide protection against the virus.

We also trained them about how to put in place a proper triage system and detect suspected Ebola patients at the clinic door. We explained that if they then detected a suspected case, they were to contact us and a properly trained ambulance team would come and collect the patient safely.

The dedication of these healthcare workers, who care for their communities with very little resources, is what impressed me the most during my time in Itipo. They show an amazing level of commitment to their patients.

I will notably remember George, a nurse from Itipo. His wife had been diagnosed with a confirmed case of Ebola and transferred to a treatment centre in Bikoro, another village where MSF was helping the Ministry of Health to run an Ebola treatment centre. But he chose to stay in his village and provide medical care to the community. He also volunteered to disinfect the houses of patients suspected of being infected with Ebola. During their 21-day follow-up as contacts of a confirmed Ebola case, George's son fell sick, which obviously worried him a lot, but fortunately the boy tested negative. A couple of days after the child tested negative, his mother was discharged after beating the disease. All ended well for this wonderful man. Later, he joined our team as a nurse at the Ebola transit centre we were running in Itipo.

[The remoteness of the area will make long term follow-up extremely difficult. Yet it is important to follow the vaccines over time for duration of antibody and occurrence of adverse effects over time. It is equally important to follow survivors - see last post below - and to monitor the region for new cases. - Mod.LK]

[3] W Africa: Survivor problems
- Psychological support
Date: Thu 12 Jul 2018

http://pscentre.org/updated-briefing-paper-psychosocial-support-ebola/


Ebola epidemics are unlike anything seen before: The virus spreads rapidly, the disease is infectious and has a high mortality rate, and often there are widespread rumors, misconceptions and misinformation about the disease and how to prevent it are widespread.

Psychosocial support is vital to ensure the well-being of the affected population, and also to counter-act the threats to public health and safety that fear, stigmatization and misconception poses.

When people of concern have access to information, understand the disease and how it spreads, feel supported and are calmed, understand their own needs and reactions, they are much more inclined to comply with instructions from health personnel, change habits and to support each other in finding ways to adapt and reconstruct community life. Furthermore, psychosocial support to expatriate and local staff and volunteers is important as all are working under extremely stressful conditions.

This briefing note provides background knowledge on the psychosocial aspects related to Ebola and suggests psychosocial support activities that can be implemented. The messages can be helpful for all staff and volunteers who are in contact with patients, relatives and feel the strain of working and living during the epidemic.

This briefing is based on the briefing note developed by the PS Centre in 2014 in connection with the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa.

- Mental and neurological problems
Date: Wed 11 Jul 2018

Long-term neurological disorders persisted in Ebola virus disease survivors, and a portion of survivors were associated with mental health issues, researchers found.

Up to 35 of 40 patients at a clinic in Sierra Leone demonstrated neurologic or psychiatric symptoms -- including 13 who experienced migraines, 2 patients who were diagnosed with stroke, 2 with peripheral sensory neuropathy, and 2 with peripheral nerve lesions, reported Patrick Howlett, MD, of the University of Liverpool in Liverpool, England, and colleagues.

Additionally, 16 of 19 patients at a joint neurology and psychiatric clinic were referred for local mental health follow-up, and 5 met criteria for either generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive disorder, the authors wrote in Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Following the 2014 -- 2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, brain imaging proved the virus could invade the central nervous system (CNS), the study stated, with documented cases of cerebral atrophy, meningoencephalitis, and ischemia. Previous studies also revealed increased fatigue, diminished work capacity; sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and adjustment disorder in Ebola survivors.

Although previous reports explored the presence of neurologic sequelae in Ebola survivors, past studies involving the prevalence of headaches in survivors of Ebola have been largely inconclusive. In one study, 90 percent of subjects reported headaches, but when compared to the control population, 75 percent of which reported headaches, the results proved non-significant.

"We wanted to try and provide a platform for high quality critical care for the survivors in a way that was in partnership with Sierra Leone," Howlett told MedPage Today. "Evidence shows how we are able to provide the level of specialist and high quality care that these Ebola survivors deserve."

Howlett and his team observed a group of 334 Ebola survivors who attended the 34 Military Hospital (34MD) Ebola Survivors Clinic Freetown in Sierra Leone. They were 12 or older and possessed complete clinical records. The median age of the group was 28 and it included 161 female patients. Of the 334 Ebola survivors observed, 50 percent reported headaches, 9.9 percent a loss of appetite and 6.6 percent generalized weakness.

In order to be invited to attend the clinic, subjects were required to report at least one major (focal weakness, deafness, depression, and anxiety) or 2 minor (headache, insomnia, and weakness) symptoms, or be referred by clinic staff. About one 3rd (n=111) were eligible to visit the clinic and 40 attended. Female patients were more likely to be invited to the clinic than male patients.

There were 21 (95 percent CI 36.1-68.4 percent) patients who reported difficulty sleeping, 12 (95 percent CI 16.5-46.5 percent) reporting depressive symptoms, and 11 (95 percent CI 14.6-43.9 percent) with anxiety symptoms. Two physicians evaluated the cohort for neurologic and psychiatric symptoms. Of the 40 patients, 19 were defined as having severe neurologic symptoms and were referred to a joint neurologic and psychiatric clinic, where they received a brain CT scan and retinal imaging. Of 17 patients who received CT scans, 3 showed atypical cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy and 2 confirmed clinical assessment of stroke, the authors said.

A total of 12 patients described eye pain and 8 reported partial loss in vision. The report states that 17 went on to be treated by ophthalmology specialists, where imaging showed 3 survivors had Ebola retinal lesions. Other neurologic symptoms in the group included 3 cases of tinnitus, 2 cases of tremor, and one case of asymmetric lower limb atrophy with weakness of unknown etiology, the study states. The authors also found that 10 participants reported "high levels of disability," along with physical symptoms and mental health issues.

"Our case series ... confirms there are long-term neurologic sequelae in EVD [Ebola virus disease] survivors and a substantial proportion of these patients have ongoing mental health problems and disability," the authors concluded. "Often, these issues cluster together, and services should therefore seek out and support patients with a high burden of illness. If we wish to expand specialist services to the remaining EVD survivors and broader population, the only credible and sustainable option is to greatly increase support for in-country specialist training of doctors."

Due to a lack of countrywide data on conditions like headache and stroke, researchers said they could not determine the absolute representativeness of their results. The team did not test suspected myopathy cases, despite the fact that diabetic neuropathy, entrapment neuropathy, or critical illness polyneuropathy with slow recovery are potential causes. Lastly, 71 out of the 111 patients invited to the clinic were not included due to inattendance, as well as patients who had only one symptom to report.

[Citation: Howlett PJ et al. Case Series of Severe Neurologic Sequelae of Ebola Virus Disease during Epidemic, Sierra Leone. Emerg Infec Dis 24 (8) -- August 2018 ahead of print

Abstract. We describe a case series of 35 Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors during the epidemic in West Africa who had neurologic and accompanying psychiatric sequelae. Survivors meeting neurologic criteria were invited from a cohort of 361 EVD survivors to attend a preliminary clinic. Those whose severe neurologic features were documented in the preliminary clinic were referred for neurology specialist evaluation, ophthalmology examination, and psychiatric assessment. Of 35 survivors with neurologic sequelae, 13 had migraine headache, 2 stroke, 2 peripheral sensory neuropathy, and 2 peripheral nerve lesions. Of brain computed tomography scans of 17 patients, 3 showed cerebral and/or cerebellar atrophy and 2 confirmed strokes. Sixteen patients required mental health follow-up; psychiatric disorders were diagnosed in 5. The 10 patients who experienced greatest disability had co-existing physical and mental health conditions. EVD survivors may have ongoing central and peripheral nervous system disorders, including previously unrecognized migraine headaches and stroke.]

[This report is a follow-up of the 2014--2016 W Africa Ebola outbreak. There has been no information on sequelae such as ocular pathology in survivors following the 2018 DRC outbreak. In addition, there has been no information on sexual transmission or death of newborn babies following maternal infection in the DRC outbreak. The difference between the 2 outbreaks may be a result of the many more cases seen in 2014 - 2016 in W Africa, or it may possibly be a matter of time before these problems are evident in the DRC. Follow-up of the survivors needs to be conducted to assess health over time. MSF has turned over responsibility to respond to other health emergencies (see ProMED mail Ebola update (48): Congo DR, MSF, susp. deaths, RFI 20180703.5886426), so they are not available to conduct these follow-up evaluations; but one hopes the DRC MoH is able to step in, in their place. The remoteness of the region will undoubtedly exacerbate follow-up. - Mod.LK]
