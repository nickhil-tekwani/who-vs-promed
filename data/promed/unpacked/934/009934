this outbreak.

Measures applied: Control of arthropods; No vaccination; No treatment
of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: No other measures

[BTV-24 was discovered in Israel for the 1st time in November 2008.
The identification of this new-to-Israel virus in 6 sheep flocks was
carried out at the Arbovirus Research Group and Bluetongue Community
Reference Laboratory, Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright
Laboratory, Surrey UK. Their detailed report, in cooperation with the
Israeli National Veterinary laboratory, was included in posting
20090130.0412. Subsequently, Israel duly notified the OIE on the
identification of the new strain. This report, available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=7737>,
includes a map showing the 6 locations. Though the collected
epidemiological information (number of clinical cases) was an
estimate, it seemed that the new strain was of a considerable
pathogenicity (31 dead sheep out of 130 estimated cases).

The 2009 outbreak, covered in the current OIE notification of 29 May
2009, is characterised by an extremely high case fatality rate (80
percent). This moderator is not aware of similar BTV-related figures
recorded in the past in Israel or elsewhere (though some flocks of
the Sardic sheep breed, during the 2000 BTV-2 outbreaks in Sardinia,
may have been affected on an almost similar level).

There are 2 other unusual epidemiological features in relation to the
described outbreak: time and place.

Bluetongue is characterised in Israel by a strict seasonal pattern,
the disease season usually starting in June-July, peaking in
October-November, absent between February and May. The current
outbreak, in March, is highly exceptional.

The location of this outbreak, En-Hazeva in the arid, central Arava
region of southern Israel (medium annual precipitation rate of 31
mm), is highly exceptional as well. No bluetongue outbreaks have been
observed in this part of the country in the past. Vaccination against
bluetongue (with the quadrivalent vaccine applied in the northern
parts of the country) has never been carried out there.

En-Hazeva is located on the Jordanian border. In view of the observed
high pathogenicity of this strain, the veterinary authorities in the
Jordanian Arava, as well as elsewhere in Jordan, should consider
intensifying their surveillance activities: culicoides recognise no
borders. Unfortunately, no vaccine against BTV-24 is available.

Bluetongue is regarded endemic in Israel since its initial
laboratory-confirmed identification in 1951, with clinical disease
seen almost every year, mainly in sheep of European breeds or their
crosses. Six serotypes have been identified in Israel throughout the
years, namely BTV-4 (1951), BTV-16 (1968), BTV-6 (1972), BTV-2
(1973), BTV-10 (1973), and -- after 32 years of a seemingly "stable"
situation -- BTV-15 (2006) (year of 1st identification). BTV-4 is the
most prevalent serotype.

BTV-24 has become Israel's 7th serotype; another newly introduced
serotype, namely BTV-8, has also been found for the 1st time in
Israel during the fall of 2009, becoming Israel's 8th serotype. While
the source of BTV-24 remains unknown, it has been hypothesized that
BTV-8, which severely affected dairy cattle in Rosh Haniqra -- on the
Lebanese border -- during October-November 2009, may have been
introduced from Europe by live, unvaccinated cattle exported to
Lebanon (see also commentary in 20090620.2268). Genotyping of the
Israeli and Omani BTV-8 isolates may facilitate exclusion (or
confirmation) of the said hypothesis.

Finally: in view of the significance of breed susceptibility to BTV,
it will help if the notifying agency includes, within the useful
epidemiological comments, details of the sheep breeds involved, if
available. - Mod.AS]
