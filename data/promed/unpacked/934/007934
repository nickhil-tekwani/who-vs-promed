Lr19 Resistance in Wheat Becomes Susceptible to _Puccinia triticina_ in India.

Regional Station, Directorate of Wheat Research (ICAR), Flowerdale,
Shimla-171 002, Himachal Pradesh, India. Plant Dis. 89:1360, 2005;
published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-1360A. Accepted for
publication 29 Sep 2005.
Lr19, a resistance gene originally transferred from _Agropyron
elongatum_ to wheat (_Triticum aestivum_ L.), has remained effective
worldwide against leaf rust (_Puccinia triticina_ Eriks.) except in
Mexico (1). This report records a new pathotype of _P. triticina_
virulent on Lr19 from India.
From 2003 to 2004, 622 wheat leaf rust samples from 14 states were
subjected to pathotype analysis. Samples were established on
susceptible wheat cv. Agra Local, and pathotypes were identified on 3
sets of differentials following binomial nomenclature (3). Virulence
on Lr19 (Agatha T4 line) was observed in approximately 2 percent of
samples. These samples were picked from Lr19 (NIL), cvs. Ajit, Lal
Bahadur, Local Red, Lok1, and Nirbhay from Karnataka and Gujarat
states. All Lr19 virulent isolates were identical. The reference
culture is being maintained on susceptible wheat cv. Agra Local and
has also been put under long-term storage in a national repository at
Flowerdale.
From 2004 to 2005, this pathotype was detected in 6.3 percent of
samples from central and peninsular India. There is no wheat variety
with Lr19 under cultivation in India, however, it is being used in
wheat breeding programs targeted at building resistance against leaf
and stem rusts. NIL's Lr19/Sr25 (LC25) and Lr19/Sr25 (82.2711) were
also susceptible to this isolate, whereas Lr19/Sr25 (spring
accession) was resistant. The new isolate, designated as 253R31
(77-8), appears to be close to the pathotype 109R31 (4) with
additional virulence for Lr19. The avirulence/virulence formula of
pathotype 253R31 is Lr9, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27+31, 28, 29, 32, 36, 39,
41, 42, 43, 45/Lr1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14a, 14b, 14ab,
15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22a, 22b, 30, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 44, 48, and 49.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of virulence on Lr19 from 2
states of India. On international rust differentials, it is
designated as TGTTQ (2), and is different from CBJ/QQ (1), the other
isolate reported virulent on Lr19 from Mexico. The Mexican isolate is
avirulent on Lr1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3ka, 16, 21, and 30 to which the Indian
isolate is virulent.
However, both isolates are avirulent on Lr9, 24, 26, 36, and Lr42.
Among the wheat cultivars identified during the last 6 years, HD2824,
HD2833, HD2864, HI1500, HS375, HUW 510, HW 2044, HW 5001, Lok 45,
MACS 6145, MP4010, NW 2036, PBW 443, PBW 498, PBW 502, PBW 524, Raj
4037, UP 2565, VL 804, VL 829, and VL 832 and lines of wheat
possessing Lr9, Lr23, Lr24, and Lr26 showed resistance to this
pathotype. PBW 343, which occupies more than 5 million ha in India,
is also resistant to this pathotype along with PBW 373.
An integrated strategy using a combination of diverse resistance
genes, deployment of cultivars by using pathotype distribution data,
slow rusting, and adult plant resistance is in place to curtail
selection of new pathotypes and prevent rust epiphytotics.

[The report that the Lr 19 resistance gene for leaf rust no longer
confers resistance against the fungus is cause for concern. Leaf or
brown rust caused by _Puccinia triticina_is one of the most important
cereal diseases worldwide. Yield losses may reach 40 percent in
susceptible cultivars, but it is generally in the range from 1-20
percent. The global leaf rust population varies in virulence and this
variation may result from one or more factors. Development of genetic
resistance to rust is the most efficient, cost-effective and
environment-friendly approach to prevent the losses caused by rust
epidemics. The use of cultivars with single-gene resistance permits
the selection of mutations at a single locus to render the resistance
effective in a relatively short time.
However, due to selection pressure and evolution, new virulent races
of the fungus appear, which increase the need to develop durable
resistance. Hence the use of combinations of genes, irrespective of
whether they are major or minor, has been suggested as the best
method for genetic control of leaf rust. This can be achieved by
pyramiding effective resistance genes, but they are difficult to
monitor in the field for expression of individual resistance genes
against the background of other resistance genes. With the advent of
molecular marker technology it is now possible to tackle such complex problems.
DNA-based molecular markers have several advantages over the
traditional phenotype markers. They can be used for marker-assisted
selection (MAS) to improve the efficiency of selection in plant
breeding because the environment does not affect the expression of
molecular markers. These markers can also be detected at all stages
of plant growth, whereas phenotypic markers often can only be
identified at a specific growth stage. Many resistance genes against
leaf rust in wheat have been introgressed from wild relatives. The
leaf rust resistance genes Lr19 and Lr24 have been introgressed from
_Agropyron elongatum_. Scientists are to test the validity of the
molecular markers and the correspondence between the molecular and
the resistance tests for the leaf rust resistance genes Lr19 and Lr24
in some lines, and the use of combined tests to permit the
identification of relevant resistance lines for pyramiding resistance genes.
