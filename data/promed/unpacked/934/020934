Medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, has scaled up its operation in conflict-torn South Sudan to contain a cholera outbreak. More than 300 cholera cases have been recorded in South Sudan, and more people suspected to be suffering from the disease are waiting for their medical results.

Brian Moller, head of the (MSF) mission in South Sudan, told VOA that the group is providing assistance to public health centers to treat the increasing number of cases. He says MSF is doing its best to quickly identify cases and send patients to health centers for treatment, and has begun constructing a cholera treatment center in Gudele district, one of the areas most heavily affected by the outbreak.

In April 2014, MSF vaccinated more than 10 000 displaced people against cholera in Malakal, Upper Nile State. The state capital has changed hands several times during more than 5 months of fighting between government and rebel forces.

Humanitarian workers warn the situation is dire and may worsen as the rainy season hits. Hundreds of thousands of people in South Sudan are living in displaced persons camps, which are congested and lack clean water. Moller says MSF will make intensive efforts in the camps, schools and the wider population to curb the spread of the disease, explaining that schools will be closed down by the government to avoid congestion of children in one place to break the spread of the disease.

[2] Diarrhea - Sudan (White Nile State), suspected cholera

Fears have spread in the south over suspected cases of cholera in White Nile State, bordering South Sudan, where outbreaks of the disease have been confirmed. Medical sources revealed to APA on Sat 24 May 2014 that the epidemiology and emergency department in the state's Ministry of Health has introduced precautionary measures to contain the situation.

Sources said that more than 100 cases of watery diarrhea have been confirmed at El Zalit village in El Salam locality in Sudan's White Nile State amid concerns of the disease spreading from South Sudan. Since over 106 cases of diarrhea were recorded with 3 deaths in the area, there have been serious concerns about the deteriorating health situation in the state, which is already suffering from a lack of health services.

Cases have since been taken to Kosti Hospital for treatment, while laboratory samples have been sent to Khartoum to confirm them.

[3] Cholera - Nepal (Central Region)

At a time when Rautahat's cholera epidemic is still out of control, the pre-monsoon rain has caused further headaches for the health officials who have been struggling to control the epidemic. Due to the heavy downpour, most of the water sources in the district have become polluted, and chances of spreading disease are too high, health officials warned.

"We have been struggling hard to control the epidemic, but the rain further increased the chance of spread of the disease," Duryodhan Prasad Chandrabansi, an official at the District Health Office (DHO), Rautahat, said, adding that treatment is not the only solution and cannot control the epidemic. He said that the people in the disease-hit areas are still compelled to drink water from the local stream, which is contaminated.

2 people have died and over 800 have been infected by cholera since the outbreak started a month ago.

The DHO, Rautahat blamed water contamination as the main culprit behind the cholera epidemic. Chandrabansi reported that most people of the VDC drink water from the stream, which is contaminated with _E. coli_ and trigella [_Shigella_?] bacteria, which cause diarrheal infections.

"Contaminated water is the main cause of the spread of the disease," he said, adding that people openly defecate at the source of the stream, which is located in Makwanpur district, and the pre-monsoon rain has further polluted the water. He said that the responsible authorities in the district have failed to provide safe drinking water to the locals.

The cholera infections started after the district office of the Nepal Drinking Water Corporation (NDWC) stopped supplying water from its tankers, citing a funds crunch.

Dr Baburam Marasaini, Director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division (EDCD) under the Department of Health Services (DoHS) said that the cholera epidemic cannot be controlled only by the curative measures. "All concerned authorities in the district and the center have to coordinate to control the disease," he said.

Meanwhile, a meeting of the District Disaster Management Committee headed by the Chief District Officer (CDO) held on Monday [26 May 2014] has given responsibility of supplying tanker water to newly declared Chandranigahapur Municipality. The committee has also decided to explore alternative ways of providing safe drinking water to the people of Gaidatar VDC in the district, which is the epicenter of the epidemic.
