----------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2011, an outbreak of the quarantine-regulated pathogen _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd) occurred in a commercial glasshouse-grown tomato crop in Queensland, Australia. Phylogenetic studies showed that the genotype of this isolate grouped in a cluster of PSTVd genotypes from tomato and _Physalis peruviana_ [Cape gooseberry] and exhibited a mutation that has previously been linked to lethal symptom expression in tomato. Transmission studies showed that the viroid could be mechanically transmitted from crushed fruit sap, but not from undamaged fruits. A low rate of asymptomatic infection was determined for plants in the affected glasshouse. No PSTVd infections were detected in solanaceous weeds located outside of the infected glasshouse, excluding them from playing a role in the viroid epidemiology. Monitoring and subsequent testing of new tomato crops grown in the facility demonstrated successful eradication of the pathogen.

PSTVd has previously been reported to be seed-borne in tomato. To determine the source of the outbreak, a potential link was investigated between the outbreak of PSTVd and a prior planting of a trial line of tomato cv. Tiger that had shown strong viroid-like symptoms. For this, 370 tomato seeds from the same imported seed batch were grown for approximately 10 weeks under strict quarantine conditions in a secure facility. All plants were monitored regularly and one seedling expressed symptoms typical of PSTVd including shortened internodes and leaf purpling, as compared with other seedlings of the same lot. Leaf samples from all 370 tomato seedlings were tested for PSTVd by RT-PCR, with no amplification observed for the 369 asymptomatic seedlings and an amplicon of the expected size produced for the symptomatic seedling. This amplicon was shown to be 100 percent identical to the PSTVd genotype [that had caused the outbreak]. Therefore, this back-tracing investigation provided evidence that imported tomato seed was the likely source of the outbreak of PSTVd.

Worldwide, outbreaks of PSTVd in tomato have become more common in recent years, and this current study shows that tomato seed likely provides a pathway for the international movement of PSTVd.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus _Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous crops including potato, tomato, and capsicum. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 percent in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato. Many solanaceous ornamental and weed species are also susceptible to PSTVd.

Symptoms in tomatoes include leaf chlorosis and discolouration, leaf distortion, shortening of internodes, and stunting of plants; flower and fruit initiation stops. In potato, shoots are spindly and may show distortions and proliferations; plants are stunted, and tubers are small, elongated, cylindrical, spindle, or dumb-bell-shaped, with prominent eyes evenly distributed over the tuber; sprouting is slower than in healthy tubers. All varieties of tomato and potato appear to be susceptible, with no natural resistance to PSTVd available in either host. However, mild strains causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted at a rate of up to 100 percent, depending on the host cultivar. It is assumed to have spread among potato germplasm collections all over the world via infected true seed. Even a seed transmission rate of 1/370 as shown in the study above constitutes a considerable quarantine risk since commercial seed batches shipped between countries usually consist of thousands of seeds.

Spread occurs also via infected plants or vegetative plant parts (potato seed tubers, tomato explants), pollen, mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and plant-to-plant contact. The results above confirm transmission with sap from damaged tomato fruit which would suggest that handling procedures during harvest may contribute to viroid spread in crops. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll virus_ can PSTVd also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus persicae_).

Due to the multiple potential transmission routes and the large number of host species, both epidemiology and control of PSTVd are complicated. The presence of PSTVd and other pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries and must be considered a threat to crops. Furthermore, PSTVd is exceptionally stable and can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified PSTVd-free seed and other planting material.

Due to their potential effects on a number of very important crops, pospiviroids are considered an emerging phytosanitary threat worldwide. The study above now demonstrates conclusively the quarantine risk of seed imports and the importance of reliable certification and screening schemes before release to growers.
