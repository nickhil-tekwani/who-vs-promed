Uzbekistan undertakes measures against anthrax
----------------------------------------------
Uzbekistan is undertaking additional measures to prevent possible
carrying of anthrax to Uzbekistan. Several cases of anthrax were
registered in neighbouring countries. Bakhtiyar Niyazmatov, head
state sanitary doctor of Uzbekistan and Deputy Health Minister, said
in interview with UzA that antiepidemic units, under the Health
Ministry and its regional offices, were established in all regions of
Uzbekistan to coordinate and carry out measures on prevention spread
of quarantine and dangerous infections

He said all necessary conditions were set at hospitals for
hospitalization of suspected patients and to render all necessary
medical services.

State sanitary inspection is holding regular research of soil for
anthrax agents in those places, where flare [outbreaks] of infection
is possible. The process of immunization of groups of individuals
with increased risk of infection is underway.

He said that with the purposes of prevention of distribution of this
dangerous disease in the border areas of Uzbekistan 78 Sanitary
Control Units have been set up. Specialists working in these units
are carrying out sanitary and medical examination of all people,
crossing border, he added.

[Uzbek reports of disease to OIE are erratic at best and of dubious
quality. The frequency of livestock and human anthrax on the Kergyz
(and Tajik) margins of the Fergana Valley, e.g., in the oblasts of
Jalal-Abad, Osh, and Batken, along with Kyrgyz reports of
contaminated Uzbek meat would indicate that the Uzbek government has
become aware of the problems on Uzbek farms in the Fergana Valley and
is now moblising sanitary control units to manage it. It must have
crossed some threshold level of significant incidence to trigger such
a response from Tashkent.

Clarification is requested. - Mod.MHJ]
