associated for the 1st time with sugarcane yellow leaf syndrome in
India. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 16]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yellow leaf syndrome (YLS) has been recognized as a relatively new
disease of sugarcane. Symptoms consist of yellowing leaves with a
bright yellow midrib, often when the rest of the lamina is still
green. Pink colouration may also occur as well as early drying of
leaves from the edges.

Initial evidence suggested that a previously undescribed luteovirus,
tentatively named Sugarcane yellow leaf luteovirus, was the causal
agent of YLS. Later, a phytoplasma was also detected in association
with this disease. The presence of the virus in association with
sugarcane yellow syndrome was reported in India in 2000. Leaf samples
of sugarcane showing typical midrib yellowing and apparently healthy
(symptomless) plants were collected from the Indian Institute of
Sugarcane Research, Lucknow, India.

DNA was assayed for phytoplasmas by PCR [polymerase chain reaction].
Plants with yellow midrib produced products of 1250 basepairs, which
gave restriction enzyme profiles consistent with being from a
phytoplasma. No PCR products were produced using DNA from symptomless
plants. RFLP [restriction fragment length polymorphism] analysis of
PCR products generated fragment profiles that were identical for all
the samples. PCR products were sequenced. The 16S rRNA sequence of
the Indian sugarcane yellow leaf phytoplasma (SCYLP) showed the
closest identity (99 percent) with that of SCYLP in Cuba, which
belongs to the 16SrXII (Stolbur) group. This is the 1st record of the
detection of SCYLP in sugarcane, and the identification of a 16SrXII
group phytoplasma associated with YLS in India.

[Yellow leaf disease (YLD) of sugarcane was first reported from East
Africa in 1968 and has since been recorded in the Americas, Hawaii,
Australia, and parts of Africa. Symptoms may be confined to a few
patches or spread out over up to 100 percent of a field. They include
drying of the plants, overall loss of crop vigour and premature death
of canes. Symptoms are usually more prominent on mature sugarcane
plants under stress conditions. A yield loss of up to 95 percent has
been recorded for some cultivars. The disease is spread with infected
planting material, by mechanical means and by some insects such as
sugarcane aphids. Disease management relies mainly on use of clean
planting material and exclusion of inoculum. Cultivated cane
varieties have been reported to show varying degrees of
susceptibility to YLD.

Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV) has previously been found
associated with YLD of sugarcane in India. The virus was placed in
the family of _Luteoviridae_ but has not yet been assigned to a
genus. It is transmitted by aphids in a persistent manner. SCYLV can
be eliminated by using a meristem tip tissue culture technique to
obtain clean planting material. However, over a 3-year crop cycle, 20
to 30 percent of newly established virus-free plants will become
infected. Resistant cultivars are being developed.

SCYLV appears to be associated with the disease in many regions,
however YLD symptoms in the absence of SCYLV have been reported in
South Africa in association with a phytoplasma. This is the 1st
report of a phytoplasma association for YLD in India. This
YLD-associated phytoplasma is reported to belong to the stolbur
taxonomic group (16SrXII, type member _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma
solani). Stolbur phytoplasmas have been reported from Europe and
parts of Asia and Africa affecting a range of mainly dicotyledonous
crops (for example tomato, potato, capsicum, eggplant, strawberry).
Maize (see ProMED-mail post no. 20070607.1844) and now sugarcane have
been reported as 2 of very few monocot hosts of the group.

YLD is now considered a syndrome with at least 2 pathogen factors,
SCYLV and a phytoplasma, involved. It is thought that other agents
may also cause similar symptoms and that further pathogens may
contribute to the syndrome.
