2000/157 Survey on viruses of cucurbits in Sao Paulo State, Brazil [edited]
---------------------------------------------------------------
In May 1997 and June 1999, in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, [cucurbits were
surveyed for the presence of] 5 viruses: cucumber mosaic cucumovirus [CMV],
papaya ringspot potyvirus type W [PRSV-W], watermelon mosaic potyvirus 2
(WMV-2], zucchini lethal chlorosis tospovirus [ZLCV] (EPPO Alert List),
[and] zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus [ZYMV]. Samples from 621 plants were
tested (PTA-ELISA). [PRSV-W] (49.1%) and [ZYMV] (24.8%) were the most
common. [ZLCV, CMV, and WMV-2] were found in 7.8, 6.0 and 4.5 % of the
tested samples, respectively. [ZLCV] was detected in the following plant
species: _Cucurbita moschata_, _C. moschata_, _C. maxima_, _C. pepo_,
_Cucumis anguria_, _C. sativus_, _Citrullus lanatus_, _Sechium edule_ and
_Cayaponia tibiricae_ (a wild species).

[According to the authors the year-round presence of cultivated and wild
cucurbits in Sao Paulo State and a favorable climate conducive to vector
reproduction are elements in the level of disease. Discontinuance of the
established practice of seeding new crops near old infected plantings is
recommended as a major strategy for disease management. - Mod.DH]
