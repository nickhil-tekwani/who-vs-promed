E. Coli Outbreak in Canada Kills 2

An outbreak of _E. coli_ [O157 infections caused by bacteria in the water
supply of this southern Ontario [town killed two people Wednesday - an
infant and an elderly woman - and put 29 others in the hospital. It was
the worst _E. coli_ [O157 outbreak in Canadian history, said Dr. Murray
McQuigge, health officer of the Grey-Bruce region west of Toronto.
Officials were not yet sure how the bacteria, often spread by fecal matter,
got into the Walkerton water supply. Some areas of Walkerton were flooded
on May 12 after a heavy rainstorm, causing officials to speculate that
animal feces might have entered the water system.
McQuigge refused to provide specific details of the fatalities, only
identifying them as an elderly woman and a baby. Nine people were in
critical condition in hospital in London, Ontario, he said. Another 20
people also were hospitalized for cramps, fever, diarrhea and vomiting
caused by the bacteria.
On Tuesday officials detected _E. coli_ [0157 in wells in the town of 5000
residents. All five schools in Walkerton were closed Wednesday, and the
daycare center also was shut down.
More than 150 people have gone to area hospitals seeking treatment, and
hundreds more have phoned health centers complaining of E. coli symptoms.
Severe cases of _E. coli_ infection can cause kidney failure, with young
children and the elderly the most vulnerable.
McQuigge said a pediatrician in nearby Owen Sound first alerted health
officials to the problem last week, after the South Bruce-Grey Health
Center in Walkerton referred two cases to him. McQuigge said his office
received the first positive culture for _E. coli_ 0157 from a patient on
Sunday.
