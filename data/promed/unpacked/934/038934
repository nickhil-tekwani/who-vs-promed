Three people have died in what Danish health authorities say is a large outbreak of salmonellosis that has left 33 people ill. 19 people have been treated in hospital, according to Denmark's SSI [Statens Serum Institut] health agency. Those involved in the outbreak are aged between 2 and 92. All those affected ate Husk brand psyllium husk capsules from batches recalled by manufacturer Orkla Care. Authorities found traces of _Salmonella_ in the products at patients' homes.

The herbal products are generally used as a laxative. Luise Müller of Denmark's Statens Serum Institut said it was the 1st time the agency had found a herbal medicine to be the cause of a salmonella outbreak. It is not clear which ingredient could have caused the poisoning.

_Salmonella_ bacteria can be found in raw or undercooked meat, eggs, or other food products. Infection can cause fever, diarrhea, stomach pain, vomiting, and in some cases death.

Orkla Care spokesman Hakon Mageli told the BBC that no clear connection had been confirmed between the 3 deaths and the products.

However, as a precaution he said, "we have decided right now to recall all Husk products because of the outbreak in Denmark, and also for the Swedish and Norwegian and Finnish markets." Although the main focus of the Danish health investigation had been Husk capsules, Mr Mageli said the recall also applied to Husk powder. The company issued its last recall of a batch of Husk supplements on Monday [12 Apr 2021].

Many of those affected by the outbreak became ill in [20 Mar 2021] and the health agency first alerted the public to the outbreak on [9 Apr 2021]. By that time there was no indication of serious illness. Ms Müller said it was possible that some people were unaware they had contracted _Salmonella_ as they were already suffering from stomach problems. The 3 who died are thought to have been ill already but the health agency is unable to give details of their ages.

Mr Mageli said Orkla products had been on the Danish market for 35 years and had never had any cases of salmonella. "We don't know the reason [for the outbreak] but we have now started a full review of the process from the supply of raw materials to the finished product," he said.
