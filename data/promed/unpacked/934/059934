["Classical swine fever (CSF), also known as hog cholera, is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild swine. It is caused by a virus of the genus _Pestivirus_ of the family Flaviviridae, which is closely related to the viruses that cause bovine viral diarrhoea in cattle and border disease in sheep. There is only one serotype of CSF virus (CSFV). CSF is a disease listed by the OIE World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code).

"Treatment is not attempted. Affected pigs must be slaughtered and the carcases buried or incinerated.

"The 1st barrier to prevent an outbreak of the CSF is to apply strict and rigorous sanitary prophylaxis, as defined in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (https://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_csf.htm). A good communication between veterinary authorities, veterinary practitioners, and pig farmers; a reliable disease-reporting system; and hygiene measures protecting domestic pigs from contact with wild boar are the most effective measures to prevent the disease.

"When an outbreak occurs, many actions must be set in place urgently:
- Slaughter of all pigs on affected farms
- Safe disposal of carcasses, bedding, etc.
- Thorough disinfection
- Designation of infected zone, with control of pig movements
- Detailed epidemiological investigation, with tracing of possible sources (up-stream) and
- Surveillance of infected zone and surrounding area

"In areas where the disease is endemic, vaccination can prevent the spread of the disease. Vaccines used should be produced in accordance with the OIE standards for vaccine production. As the disease is brought under control, vaccination ceases, with continued surveillance. The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code defines the requirements for a country or a zone to be considered free of the disease.

"In disease-free areas, a stamping-out policy is applied consisting of early detection, movement control, proper disposal of carcasses, and cleaning and disinfection. This policy has led to the elimination of CSF from North America and much of Western Europe.

"CSF is found in Central and South America, Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa. North America, Australia, and New Zealand are currently free of the disease. In the 1990s, large CSF outbreaks occurred in the Netherlands (1997), Germany (1993-2000), Belgium (1990, 1993, 1994), and Italy (1995, 1996, 1997).

"Humans are not affected by this virus. Swine are the only species known to be susceptible." Source: https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/Classical-swine-fever/. - Mod.CRD
