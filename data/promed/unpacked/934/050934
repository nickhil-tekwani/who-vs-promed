6 have died and more than 100 have fallen ill in Hokkaido as of 17 Aug 2012 due to food poisoning caused by _Escherichia coli_ O157 found in pickled cabbage. Residents at 9 nursing homes in Sapporo and elsewhere in Hokkaido account for most of the cases, and 5 women in their 80s to 100s have died.

In Sapporo, a 4 year old girl died on 11 Aug 2012.

The food poisoning was attributed to lightly pickled Chinese cabbages shipped 29-30 July 2012 by a Sapporo-based food manufacturer. The Sapporo municipal health center said the raw ingredients may not have been sufficiently sterilized.

Cases of food poisoning from vegetables are much less common than those attributable to meat, fish, and shellfish, but have occurred from time to time. Lightly pickled vegetables require more caution than other types of pickles because their manufacturing process involves no heating or fermentation that would kill bacteria, experts said.

[Pickling, or brining, is a process of food preservation which eradicates most bacteria from the food. The specifics of the pickling process used in the cabbage is not stated but said to be lightly done. The extent of this significant outbreak is yet to be defined. - Mod.LL
