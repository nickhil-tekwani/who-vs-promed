[Though no genotyping has been applied during 2015, this epizootic was most probably caused by by the same FMD virus strain which was identified and genotyped during the epizootic of 2014 in Algeria and Tunisia (serotype O, Topotype ME-SA, lineage Ind-2001d). The epizootic restarted in Algeria on 2 Mar 2015, causing a total of 12 outbreaks in cattle and sheep farms. Goats have reportedly not been affected. All reports and an interactive map are available at:
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=17331.

According to the above map, the 12 outbreaks in 2015 involved 4 provinces: El Bayadh - 9 outbreaks; El Oued, Saida and Sidi bel Abbes provinces - 1 outbreak each. The most recent outbreak, reported in follow-up report No 4, was recorded on a farm in Ghassoul (EL Bayadh province); it started on 11 Apr 2015, when 4 cases were seen in sheep (out of 500 susceptible animals). The 2 cows present on the same premises were, reportedly, not affected. There were no mortalities; similarly to all other outbreaks, no stamping out was applied. This outbreak was declared "resolved" on 3 May 2015. This date, thus, has become the date of the outbreak's resolution nationally.

An OIE summary of the entire epizootic is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000017849_20150608_143653.pdf, including the following statistics:
Total outbreaks = 12 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Cattle/ 42/ 1/ 0/ 0/ 0
Goats/ 108/ 0/ 0/ 0/ 0
Sheep/ 5350/ 158/ 0/ 0/ 0

Vaccination in response to outbreak:
wilaya/ Species/ Number/ Vaccinated
EL BAYADH Cattle 1810
EL BAYADH/ Goats/ 8374
EL BAYADH/ Sheep/ 99 407
EL OUED/ Cattle/ 367

(These summarised vaccination data are not compatible with the data given separately in each of the follow-up reports; an official report giving the total number of vaccinations per species and province, as well the vaccine strains/valency used, will be much appreciated).

According to Algeria's press, other FMD outbreaks occurred during 2015 in the provinces Ghardaia, Sidi Bel Abbes and Constantine [see: ProMED-MENA archive numbers 20150423.3318493 and 20150506.3344685 at http://www.promedmail.org/mena].

The current FMD status of the Maghreb countries, following the 2014/15 events and the application of vaccination, is expected to be discussed and decided upon by OIE's relevant committee(s). - Mod.AS
