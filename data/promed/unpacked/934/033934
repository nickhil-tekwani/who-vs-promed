Public Health Agency of Canada and its partners are investigating a salmonellosis outbreak linked to dried sprouted chia seed powder.

Canadian health officials say a total of 9 cases involving 2 strains are associated with consumption of sprouted chia seed powder made from ground, dried chia seeds. In total, 9 cases have been reported in British Columbia (6), Alberta (1) and Quebec (2). One case was hospitalized and has recovered. No deaths have been reported. The investigation is ongoing, but, currently, 7 of 7 cases that have been interviewed have reported consumption of dried sprouted chia seed powder.

The strains identified include _Salmonella [enterica_ serotypes] Newport and Hartford, according to health officials.

In addition, as part of the investigation, The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued a food recall warning for various products from Advantage Health Matters containing sprouted chia seeds under the brands Organic Traditions and Back 2 the Garden. These products have been recalled and are being removed from the marketplace due to possible contamination.

Health officials advise consumers who have purchased these products to not consume them.

[On 30 May 2014, ProMED (see below) posted a similar alert and recall regarding _S._ Newport related to chia powder and smoothies made from the powder in the USA. 12 individuals were affected in 7 states.

The source of the initial contamination is as yet unknown, and it has not yet been shown that the _S._ Newport strains from the USA and Canada are genetically matched. It is likely, however, that the chia is from the same source.

Chia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_hispanica), plant name _Salvia hispanica_, is grown commercially for its seed, a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, since the seeds yield 25-30 percent extractable oil, including alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). Of total fat, the composition of the oil can be 55 percent omega-3, 18 percent omega-6, 6 percent omega-9, and 10 percent saturated fat. Chia seeds are typically small ovals with a diameter of about one mm (0.039 in). They are mottle-colored, brown, gray, black, and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous gel-like coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive texture.
