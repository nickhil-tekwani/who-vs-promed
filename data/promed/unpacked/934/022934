The spread of diseases from land animals to sea otters and other marine mammals is aided and abetted by gelatinous, sticky polymers produced by seaweed, reports a research team headed by a UC [University of California] Davis veterinary infectious-disease expert.

These large, complex molecules form slimy biofilms and bind water-borne organic matter into larger particles, in which disease-causing microorganisms can become embedded and introduced to the marine food chain, the researchers discovered.

Using the parasite _Toxoplasma gondii_ as a model, they showed how these sticky polymers increase the chance that disease-causing organisms would be picked up by marine snails, which graze on kelp and are among the common foods of some endangered sea otters.

Findings from the new study will be published [8 Oct 2014] in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

"Discovering the role that these invisible polymers play in disease transmission in the ocean is a tremendous step forward in helping us better understand and mitigate the impacts of coastal water pollution on the health of wildlife and humans," said lead author Karen Shapiro, a research scientist in the School of Veterinary Medicine.

Contamination of coastal waters with disease-causing microorganisms is known to pose a threat to the health of both humans and animals, but the mechanisms by which diseases are transmitted in marine ecosystems has until now remained a mystery.

The researchers focused on _Toxoplasma gondii_, a protozoan parasite that infects animals and humans worldwide.

The parasite actively reproduces in various cat species including domestic cats. Its egg cells pass on in cat feces and can persist in the environment for months to years, infecting marine mammals including the endangered southern sea otter in California.

Humans also can be infected by _T. gondii_ when they consume contaminated water or undercooked shellfish.

Puzzled by the high rate of _T. gondii_ infection in sea otters and other marine mammals, the researchers set out to track the route of transmission. Noting that _T. gondii_ infections were 10 times more common among sea otters that fed heavily on kelp-grazing marine snails than among otters that fed on abalone and other ocean food sources, they investigated why the sea snails might be particularly effective carriers of the parasite.

In laboratory tests, the researchers discovered that the gelatinous polymers, excreted by seaweed, act in 2 ways to provide an environment conducive to transmission of infectious diseases. First, the polymers act like glue, binding together water-borne organic material into larger particles, in which infectious agents like the _T. gondii_ egg cells can embed and more quickly settle to the ocean floor.

Second, the polymers help to form sticky biofilms, which can trap the _T. gondii_ egg cells and coat kelp on which marine snails graze. The parasite then can be easily passed on when the snails are eaten by otters, completing the intricate chain of disease transmission from land-based cats to the endangered coastal sea otters.

Other researchers on the study were Colin Krusor, Patricia A Conrad, John L Largier and Jonna AK Mazet, all of UC Davis, and Fernanda FM Mazzillo and Mary W Silver, both of UC Santa Cruz.

The National Science Foundation's Evolution and Ecology of Infectious Disease program provided funding for the study.

The abstract reads:
"Gelatinous polymers including extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) are fundamental to biophysical processes in aquatic habitats, including mediating aggregation processes and functioning as the matrix of biofilms. Yet insight into the impact of these sticky molecules on the environmental transmission of pathogens in the ocean is limited. We used the zoonotic parasite _Toxoplasma gondii_ as a model to evaluate polymer-mediated mechanisms that promote transmission of terrestrially derived pathogens to marine fauna and humans. We show that transparent exopolymer particles, a particulate form of EPS, enhance _T. gondii_ association with marine aggregates, material consumed by organisms otherwise unable to access micrometre-sized particles. Adhesion to EPS biofilms on macroalgae also captures _T. gondii_ from the water, enabling uptake of pathogens by invertebrates that feed on kelp surfaces. We demonstrate the acquisition, concentration and retention of _T. gondii_ by kelp-grazing snails, which can transmit _T. gondii_ to threatened California sea otters. Results highlight novel mechanisms whereby aquatic polymers facilitate incorporation of pathogens into food webs via association with particle aggregates and biofilms. Identifying the critical role of invisible polymers in transmission of pathogens in the ocean represents a fundamental advance in understanding and mitigating the health impacts of coastal habitat pollution with contaminated runoff."

Toxoplasma is a significant cause of mortality in threatened Southern sea otters. As wild and domestic felids are the only recognized hosts capable of shedding _T. gondii_ oocysts into the environment, otter infection suggests land-to-sea pathogen transmission. This work sheds new light on the mechanisms involved.
