["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus Lagovirus and family Caliciviridae. Many strains of RHDV appear to circulate in rabbit populations; these viruses can have distinct epidemiological and genetic characteristics. Only a single serotype is known, but 2 major subtypes exist: RHDV and the antigenic variant RHDVa. Nonpathogenic strains of RHDV have been identified in wild rabbits. One recent study suggests that different lineages of RHDV may have repeatedly emerged as epidemic viruses.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is an extremely contagious and often fatal viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. This disease affects only rabbits of the species _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. Severe losses are common in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all of the rabbits may die. This disease has also caused dramatic declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it is 1st introduced. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease spreads very readily. The causative virus is very resistant to inactivation if it is protected by organic material; it may persist in chilled or frozen rabbit meat, as well as in decomposing carcasses in the environment, for months.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. Outbreaks have also been reported from domesticated rabbits in the Middle East and the Americas.

There is no indication that rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus infects humans" (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf).

According to the OIE's WAHID database, Benin has a population of 73 310 rabbits (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation). - Mod.CRD
