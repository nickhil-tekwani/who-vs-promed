Outbreaks of a previously unknown wheat leaf disease have been reported in South Africa, which could have a serious impact on food security and sustainable wheat production in the country. The disease was first observed in 2011 in KwaZulu-Natal and the Northern Cape. Since then, [it] has become widespread in the irrigation wheat-growing areas.

Dr Tarekegn Terefe, ARC-Small Grain, said it usually started as yellow streaks [that] gradually join, turning the infected leaves yellow. In most cases, infected plants were shorter than normal. The disease had been observed at tillering and at later growth stages [and] usually occurred in patches. "This could eventually lead to [a wider] disease outbreak and yield losses", he said.

Indications were that the disease was caused by viruses. However, symptoms were not consistent with previously reported wheat viruses in South Africa. Researchers were investigating the identity of this disease. "Preliminary results suggest the involvement of soil and mite-borne viruses," Terefe said.

[Over 55 viruses have so far been reported to affect wheat. Of these, important species include _Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (transmitted by the soil-inhabiting fungus-like _Polymyxa graminis_) and the mite transmitted _Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (for more information on these viruses see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Symptoms described above could apply to these as well as to some other wheat pathogens.

It is reported above that the problem was first noted in the country in 2011. Considering the vital importance of wheat as a crop and the fact that reliable diagnosis of the pathogen(s) is needed for effective disease management, it seems surprising that attempts to find the cause have been delayed until now.
