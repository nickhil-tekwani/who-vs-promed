Shanghai's municipal health and family planning commission on Friday [18 Mar 2016] confirmed the city's 1st case of yellow fever reported this year.

The patient, a 46-year-old man from the eastern province of Jiangsu, 1st experienced fever symptoms on 5 Mar 2016 while in Luanda, capital of Angola, where he contracted the virus.

He sought medical treatment after returning from the African country to China on 7 Mar 2016.

The man tested positive for yellow fever at the Shanghai Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday [14 Mar 2016] and the infection was confirmed by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday [17 Mar 2016].

According to the commission, the patient has suffered liver damage but is in stable condition.

Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes and mostly found in tropical regions of Africa and Central and South America.

A panel of experts from the Shanghai disease control and prevention authority evaluated the case, concluding the risk of transmission and spreading is fairly low, as it is not mosquito breeding season.

The symptoms of the disease include fever, jaundice, and bleeding.

China's National Health and Family Planning Commission on Sunday [13 Mar 2016] confirmed the nation's 1st yellow fever case this year in Beijing.

The patient, a 32-year-old man from east China's Zhejiang Province, had also returned from Luanda.

[The arrival of the 2nd individual infected with yellow fever virus in China underscores the need for those going into yellow fever (YF) virus endemic areas, such as Angola, to be vaccinated, not only to protect their own health but to eliminate the risk of transport of the virus to other localities where ongoing transmission could occur. Mod.JW mentioned that Shanghai is located in one of the southern provinces in China's dengue belt, where the mosquito season will start next month (April), at which time there will be increased risk from inevitable future citizens returning infected from Angola, where thousands of Chinese are engaged in building and infrastructure projects. This situation does not sound the alarm just for China, but for areas in South and Southeast Asia as well, where vector mosquitoes are abundant. Had the infected individual landed in India, Thailand or Indonesia instead of China during the non-vector season, a major public health emergency could have resulted if not detected early, eliciting an aggressive response by public health officials.
