Anglers, recreational boaters and property owners have been reporting a fair number of crappies, sunfish and rock bass floating throughout Big Birch Lake in Todd County over the past week [9 - 15 Jun 2012].

The fish likely died as a result of columnaris disease, which is quite common on many lakes during the spring as panfish spawn in shallow water. As the water warms quickly and the fish are already stressed due to spawning, some of them succumb to the bacterial disease.

It's usually a small percentage of the fish population that's affected and the disease is recognizable by discoloration on the body or scales, or eroded gills.

Columnaris is one of many diseases that fish in Minnesota lakes have been known to acquire. Most are unsightly, but they rarely result in widespread mortality.

In a recent interview, Ling Shen, pathology lab supervisor with the Department of Natural Resources, offered some insight to those odd-looking growths, warts and lesions one might encounter on the fish they catch.

Columnaris disease is caused by _Flavobacterium columnare_, a Gram-negative bacterium. It affects freshwater fish worldwide. Stress and pollutants in water can affect the severity of _F. columnare_ infections in fish>.
