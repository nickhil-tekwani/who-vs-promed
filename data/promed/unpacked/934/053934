Leaf spot disease of Cabbage by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _armoraciae_,
Odessa region, Ukraine
----------------------
According to Valentine Kotsur, agriculturist in the Odessa office of the
Project of Agrarian Marketing, leaf spot disease caused by _Xanthomonas
campestris_ pv. _armoraciae_ on late white cabbage and cauliflower has been
observed in farms in southern and central Ukraine. One feature of this disease
is rapid leaf shrinkage, and it results in crop shortages, reduction in
quality of the cabbage head, and sometimes complete destruction of a plant.
Additionally, affected cabbages do not store well.
The disease is transferred through infected seed and plant material as well as
through infected soil; therefore crop rotation is of special value. High
humidity and damage by insects contribute to the progress of the disease. It
is difficult to combat cabbage leaf spot disease, as the majority of [chemical
sprays] cannot kill bacteria. It is more effective to use preventive measures,
including preparations containing copper. Spread from affected fields in
vegetable-growing areas can lead to decreased yields of late cabbage.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _armoraciae_ [Xpa] is also present in the USA,
Australia, Japan, Brazil, China, Turkey, and India. The disease is favored by
cool temperatures in fall and winter, although it infects susceptible hosts
over a wide temperature range. Infected plant debris is a source of inoculum
and Xpa is known to be soil- and seed-borne. Disease management involves use
of bacteria-free seed, planting in well-drained soils, and rotation of non-
cruciferous crops on a 3-year cycle. Apparently there are no tolerant or
resistant cultivars. - Mod.DH]
