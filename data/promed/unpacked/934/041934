The number of human tuberculosis (TB) cases that are due to transmission from animals, as opposed to human-to-human transmission, may be much higher than previously estimated, according to an international team of researchers. The results could have implications for epidemiological studies and public health interventions.

"Tuberculosis kills 1.4 million people every year, making it the most deadly disease arising from a single infectious agent," said Vivek Kapur, professor of microbiology and infectious diseases and Huck distinguished chair in global health, Penn State. India has the largest burden of human tuberculosis globally, with more than 2.6 million cases and 400 000 deaths reported in 2019. Additionally, the cattle population in India exceeds 300 million, and nearly 22 million of these were estimated to be infected with TB in 2017.

Kapur noted that the World Health Organization, World Organisation for Animal Health, and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations define zoonotic TB as human infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_, a member of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MTBC).

To evaluate the use of _M. bovis_ as a proxy for zoonotic tuberculosis and to investigate the potential role of other MTBC subspecies, Kapur and his colleagues analyzed 940 bacterial samples -- both pulmonary (from lung fluid or tissue) and extrapulmonary (from tissues other than the lungs) -- collected from patients who were visiting a large reference hospital for TB in southern India. The researchers used PCR to speciate _M. tuberculosis_ complex organisms and then sequenced all the non-_M. tuberculosis_ samples. Next, they compared the sequences to 715 sequences from cattle and humans that had previously been collected in south Asia and submitted to public databases.

"Surprisingly, we did not find any evidence for the presence of _M. bovis_ in any of the samples," said Sreenidhi Srinivasan, postdoctoral scholar in the Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences. "Instead, we found that 7 of the patient samples contained _M. orygis_. 6 of these came from patients with extrapulmonary TB."

They describe their findings in a paper published [1 Jun 2020] in The Lancet Microbe [1].

As expected, most of the remainder of the sequences from the patients belonged to _M. tuberculosis_ -- the TB bacterium that is generally thought to be transmitted only among humans.

"Our findings suggest that _M. bovis_ might be uncommon in India, and that its detection may not be an adequate proxy for zoonotic TB infection in humans," said Srinivasan. "These data indicate that members of the TB complex other than _M. bovis_ might be more prevalent in livestock in India."

Kapur added that the operational definition of zoonotic TB should be broadened to include other MTBC subspecies capable of causing human disease.

"By 2035, the World Health Organization is aiming to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis by 90% as a part of its End TB Strategy," he said. "The increasing evidence supporting _M. orygis_ endemicity in south Asia and the identification of _M. tuberculosis_ in cattle highlight the importance of using a One Health approach, involving multisectoral collaboration across the veterinary and clinical sectors, to meet the WHO's goal in India."

Summary
-------
"Background
Zoonotic tuberculosis is defined as human infection with _Mycobacterium bovis_. Although globally, India has the largest number of human tuberculosis cases and the largest cattle population, in which bovine tuberculosis is endemic, the burden of zoonotic tuberculosis is unknown. The aim of this study was to obtain estimates of the human prevalence of animal-associated members of the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex (MTBC) at a large referral hospital in India.

"Methods
We did a molecular epidemiological surveillance study of 940 positive mycobacteria growth indicator tube (MGIT) cultures, collected from patients visiting the outpatient department at Christian Medical College (Vellore, India) with suspected tuberculosis between [1 Oct 2018, and 31 Mar 2019]. A PCR-based approach was applied to subspeciate cultures. Isolates identified as MTBC other than _M. tuberculosis_ or as inconclusive on PCR were subject to whole-genome sequencing (WGS), and phylogenetically compared with publicly available MTBC sequences from south Asia. Sequences from WGS were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive, accession number SRP226525 (BioProject database number PRJNA575883).

"Findings
The 940 MGIT cultures were from 548 pulmonary and 392 extrapulmonary samples. A conclusive identification was obtained for all 940 isolates; wild-type _M. bovis_ was not identified. The isolates consisted of _M. tuberculosis_ (913 [97.1%] isolates), _M. orygis_ (7 [0.7%]), _M. bovis_ BCG (5 [0.5%]), and non-tuberculous mycobacteria (15 [1.6%]). Subspecies were assigned for 25 isolates by WGS, which were analysed against 715 MTBC sequences from south Asia. Among the 715 genomes, no _M. bovis_ was identified. Four isolates of cattle origin were dispersed among human sequences within _M. tuberculosis_ lineage 1, and the seven _M. orygis_ isolates from human MGIT cultures were dispersed among sequences from cattle.

"Interpretation
_M. bovis_ prevalence in humans is an inadequate proxy of zoonotic tuberculosis. The recovery of _M. orygis_ from humans highlights the need to use a broadened definition, including MTBC subspecies such as _M. orygis_, to investigate zoonotic tuberculosis. The identification of _M. tuberculosis_ in cattle also reinforces the need for One Health investigations in countries with endemic bovine tuberculosis."

Although human TB is usually caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, other species within MTBC can also cause TB in humans. MTBC is composed of genetically related species that include _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_ (the usual cause of bovine tuberculosis), _M. bovis_-BCG, _M. microti_ (a pathogen in rodents), _M. caprae_ (a pathogen in multiple mammalian species), _M. pinnipedii_ (a pathogen primarily in seals), _M. mungi_ (a pathogen in banded mongooses), and _M. canettii_ and _M. africanum_ (both cause human TB in Africa). There are 2 additional members of MTBC, _M. dassie_ (a pathogen of hyrax, aka dassie, a small, herbivorous mammal) and _M. orygis_. _M. orygis_ was initially isolated from 11 animals (a cow and a rhesus monkey from South Asia, and waterbuck, deer, and antelope, including oryx, in zoos), and 11 humans (9 from South Asia) (1). _M. orygis_ has also been isolated from dairy cattle in Chennai, India (2), and wild animals in Nepal (3).

In 2016, WHO estimated that there were 147 000 new cases of zoonotic TB in people and 12 500 deaths due to the disease (4). Zoonotic TB in humans is thought to be predominantly caused by _M. bovis_, but members of MTBC other than _M. bovis_ can be zoonotic pathogens. In the study referenced in the news report above, _M. orygis_ was isolated from less than 1% of patients with suspected TB in Vellore, India, but no _M. bovis_ was identified. _M. orygis_ has been reported to have caused lymphadenitis in a patient in the USA who was born in Pakistan and lived in India prior to emigrating to the USA (5). _M. orygis_ has also been reported to have been transmitted to a dairy cow in New Zealand from a tuberculosis patient, who was born and lived in India until emigrating to New Zealand (6).

Vellore is a city with a population of 138 803 residents in 2011 in the state of Tamil Nadu, in southern India. Vellore is 138km (86 mi) west of the coastal city of Chennai.
