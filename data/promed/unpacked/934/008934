The following background information on leptospirosis in Israel is abstracted from Gideon <www.GideonOnline.com> and the Gideon e-book series (1,2). Primary references are available from the author.

Leptospirosis is most common in agricultural settlements of the Galilee, during the months of June to September. Reported disease incidence reached a peak of 81 cases in 1962, but has since decreased considerably; 48 cases were reported during 2002 to 2008 - including 20 travel-related cases (15 of these acquired in southeast Asia).

Rates per 100 000 have been comparable to those reported in the United States for the past 3 decades - see graph (3) (graph and chart are displayed at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/08/15/leptospirosis-in-israel/)

From 1970 to 1973, the main infecting serovars of _Leptospira interrogans_ were _grippotyphosa_ (41 percent) and _hebdomadis_ (31 percent). Serovars _hardjo_, _hebdomadis_ and _grippotyphosa_ accounted for 79 percent of cases during the 1970's, and 32 percent during 1985 to 1999. Serovar _icterohaemorrhagiae_ accounted for 2 percent during the 1970's, and 29 percent during 1985 to 1999.

A total of 14 fatal cases of leptospirosis were reported during 1954 to 2017, the most recent in 1999.

[An accompanying chart summarizes 5 outbreaks of leptospirosis reported in Israel.]
