These products have been distributed nationally. There have been no
reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.

Food contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin may not look or
smell spoiled. Consumption of food contaminated with the toxin may
cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, dizziness, headache, double vision,
dry throat, respiratory failure and paralysis. In severe cases of
illness, people may die.

The manufacturer, Mannarich Food Inc., Markham, ON, is voluntarily
recalling the affected products from the marketplace. The CFIA is
monitoring the effectiveness of the recall.

[Photos of the recalled fish products can be found at:

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in these cases)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_.

With fish like this, many recalls are related to the lack of
evisceration. - Mod.LL]
