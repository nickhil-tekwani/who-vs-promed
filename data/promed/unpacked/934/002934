A new hantavirus victim has been discovered after the SEREMI
[Secretaria Regional Ministerial de Salud; Regional Ministerial
Secretariat of Health] confirmed the death of a woman from the Pucon
community, who was rapid test positive in the Temuco Regional
Hospital. The woman [current case], 35 years of age, died this morning
[6 May 2011] in the Hernan Henriquez Hospital in Temuco where she was
admitted in a serious condition, having been transported from the
Pucon community. Gloria Rodriguez, the SEREMI, confirmed the death of
the woman from a rural zone in the lake area, as a possible hantavirus
infection after carrying out a rapid test that was positive.

This signals the 4th hantavirus death in the Araucania region in
2011, the other 3 cases in the Cunco community.

The woman left 3 children, including an infant of 5 months. In any
event, the results of tests by the Public Health Institute are awaited
to confirm, or not, that this was an infection by [a] hantavirus.

[The most likely hantavirus involved in this case and the one
following it is Andes virus.

A new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was detected this Thursday
[5 May 2011] in a 37 year old man who is admitted in good condition to
the Valdivia Hospital Base in the Los Rios region. According to the
electronic publication El Navegable, the man contracted the disease
[virus] while collecting mushrooms in the Los Lagos community. It is
worth noting that this is the 6th hanta[virus infection] in the region
during the year [2011], with the other cases in Corral port, resulting
in the deaths of 2 people.

A young man died as a result of a hantavirus [infection] in the El
Cholar locale, located in the Norquin department [Neuquen province],
60 km [37 mi] from Chos Malal. The case is a worker in the Ente
Provincial de Energia del Neuquen, who carried out tasks in this city.
Health Zone III reported that he died 19 days ago. After his death,
samples were sent to the Instituto Malbran located in Buenos Aires
city were they were tested and, finally, results were sent north to
Neuquen. According to the explanation, the man was affected [infected]
by [a] hantavirus.

After becoming aware of this situation, all precautions were
implemented by the health sector to "continuously monitor" the family
of the deceased by this virus. Also, Health Zone III recommended that
the entire population, especially in rural areas, take extra measures
to prevent infection by hantavirus[es]. "We are still in the
transmission season for this disease [virus], so we request that the
population, before entering a place [building] that has been closed
for a long time first ventilate it for a half hour, cover the nose and
mouth with a damp cloth, sprinkle the earthen floors with water with
bleach, and avoid the presence of rodents near the house, maintaining
yards clean where [one can] avoid the rodents," Health Zone III
reported. Of all the rodents, only one species -- the long-tailed
[pygmy] rat [_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_] transmits the [Andes]
hantavirus. Just 5 per cent of the [rodent] population is infected by
the virus.

[Several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in
Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy
rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like
viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown);
Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O.
flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_);
and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. This case in
far western Argentina is most likely to have been caused by Andes
virus infection, but without laboratory confirmation, it is not
possible to say with certainty. Prevalence of hantavirus infections in
given populations of their rodent reservoir host can vary
significantly, so the 5 per cent prevalence cited in the report above
is not likely to be a constant number over time.

[4] Panama (Los Santos)

Health authorities confirmed the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus infection
in the Azuero region this Thu 5 Apr [2011]. The individual was a young
woman of 20 years, resident of the El Cacao de Tonosi in Los Santos
[province] and is interned in the intensive care unit of the Pablo
Franco Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas, and her condition is stable.

This past Mon 11 Apr [2011], the Ministry of Health (MINSA) confirmed
the death of a man of about 30 years of age, from [a] hantavirus
[infection] in Veraguas province, becoming the 1st fatal victim taken
by this disease in 2011 [in Panama].

MINSA, through its office of health promotion, made a call to the
Panama population to follow the recommendations and control measures
to reduce the risk and avoid hantavirus infection. The office gives
recommendations to avoid infection and [resulting] disease by
maintaining weeds and grass cut short, keeping garbage in covered
receptacles, ventilating places closed for a long time for 30 min
before entering, among others.

Official data specify that in Panama between 1991 and 2010 more than
104 cases and at least 29 deaths have been registered.

[The 11 Apr 2011 edition of La Estrella (cited in ProMED-mail archive
no. 20110415.1190) stated, "In this country [Panama], since the
appearance of the 1st case in 1999 up to the present, about 150 cases
have been registered, of which 30 people have died," numbers
considerably higher than those given in the report above.

Although not stated in this report, in Panama, the hantavirus most
likely to be the etiological agent in this case is Choclo virus. As
mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses
(and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo
(_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens
(costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda
(cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human
pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high
case fatality rate especially when victims come to hospital late in
the course of their disease.
