A total of 15 children of the 35 whom a judge ordered to be
compulsorily vaccinated for measles following an outbreak in a school
in the city of Granada have failed to comply with the requirements of
the judiciary and the Health Authority. The parents of the children
had been given time to respond by Tuesday [30 Nov 2010]. The outbreak
has now affected 51 people.

The Andalusian Health Minister, Maria Jesus Montero, has warned that
the "the next step" would probably be the arrival of the police at
the homes of the children's parents, failing the prior compliance of
the parents. Montero has instructed the police to follow new
requirements to be provided by the Granada Court of Administrative
Litigation of Granada.

"We have no additional information other than 20 children have
already been vaccinated or have provided documentary evidence of
vaccination. The Head of the Department stated that Tuesday afternoon
[30 Nov 2010] was the deadline for compliance, and the matter was now
in the hands of the judicial authorities.

Montero stated that: "So far, the Ministry has been responsible for
communicating with the children's parents to ensure that they were
aware that the Department was acting under legal instruction." He
added that: "Probably the next step will be that a representative of
the police authority will visit the families; at least that's my guess."

The number of parents who have had their children immunised remains
unchanged since Monday [29 Nov 2010], when the Health Minister, Maria
Jesus Montero, reported that a total of 20 of the 35 had submitted
immunization records, or had agreed to provide blood samples to
verify successful immunisation. A blood test will verify that the
children had had the disease or that the parents' had permitted vaccination.

The measure ordered by the judiciary to mitigate the spread of
measles virus came after the Office of Health reported that a measles
outbreak had occurred at the Gomez Moreno Primary School, in the
Albaicin. The young age of those affected has prompted the board to
act "as an exceptional measure" to advance the measles vaccination
schedule by 6 months, in addition to promoting an awareness campaign
with the Ministry of Education.

[The number of victims in this outbreak of measles in Granada has
increased from 46 to 51 over the past 2 days, and it seems that the
Granada Police Department may now become involved to ensure that the
court's order is implemented. Much will now depend on how the
families of the 15 unvaccinated children respond to this intervention.

Granada city is the capital of the province of Granada, in the
autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. It can be located on the
