Idaho may lose USDA status; brucellosis infections may force testing
-----------------------------------------------
The U.S. Department of Agriculture will likely
strip Idaho of its coveted brucellosis-free
status following infections in eastern and
central Idaho, a move that would force cattle
ranchers to do expensive testing before their
animals are shipped out of state.
The decision is expected in January 2006, state
Department of Agriculture officials said. Idaho,
which has had brucellosis-free status since 1991,
says it may challenge the federal move. Lifting
the status would force ranchers to test female
and un-castrated male cattle over 18 months old
before selling them across state lines, according
to minimum testing guidelines.
In addition, cattle herds in eastern Idaho that
have contact with wild elk in the winter also may
have to be tested for the disease. Elk, along
with bison, are major carriers of brucellosis in
the area near Yellowstone National Park.
"We will continue our vigilance, and we will ask
cattle owners to do the same," said state
Agriculture Director Pat Takasugi.
The infection can lead to spontaneous abortions,
infertility, decreased milk production and weight
loss in cattle. It is rarely transmitted to
humans.
More than 50 cattle were slaughtered in eastern
Idaho, after veterinarians confirmed brucellosis
infections at a Swan Valley beef ranch in early
October [2005]. A 2nd case was discovered in an
Arco feedlot.

[Brucellosis is an economic drain to the
producers if their animals harbor the disease. It
is also a zoonotic disease. As such,
veterinarians, producers, and even slaughterhouse
workers are at heightened risk of contracting the
disease.
Typically, the testing on cattle involves an
intradermal test that must be read 72 hours
later, which involves having to gather the
animals a 2nd time and to have the vet available
for that time as well. There is a blood test
available, but for standard testing, it is not in
widespread use, and must have approval to be used.
Typically, the means of eliminating brucellosis
in animals is to test and slaughter. However, the
bison and elk in the Greater Yellowstone area are
considered national treasures and are infected
with this disease. They tend to spread it to
cattle. However, this most recent area is quite
some distance from the feeding grounds of
Yellowstone and does not initially appear to be
connected to the Yellowstone feeding grounds. -
