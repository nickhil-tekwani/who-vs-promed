Outbreak of malaria in Indonesia
--------------------------------
At least 6 people have died and 266 others have been treated at local
hospitals and community health centers in the Indonesian town of East
Lombok since a malaria outbreak was 1st detected in the regency at
the end of October 2005, a local newspaper reported on Saturday [19
Nov 2005].
The outbreak struck 3 subdistricts in the regency in the eastern
province of West Nusa Tenggara, said The Jakarta Post. In order to
prevent more fatalities, the local government has alerted health
centers to prepare more medicines and import doctors and nurses.
Regional administrations are also making efforts to reduce the number
of malaria-carrying mosquitoes. Officials called for residents to
quickly bring their children to hospitals if they had high fevers or
showed other malaria symptoms.
"The quicker the residents bring their children to hospitals, the
bigger the possibility the children could be saved by doctors," West
Nusa Tenggara Health Office chief of disease eradication Thamrin
Hijaz said. Thamrin said while malaria was endemic in East Lombok
regency every wet season, he was surprised at the high numbers of
cases this year [2005]. Last year, malaria also struck West Lombok,
but fewer people were infected with the virus, he said, without
giving details of the numbers.
Thamrin blamed the increase on poor sanitation in the area, which
created a sanctuary for malaria larvae to breed. Meanwhile, as
reports of the malaria outbreak reached Jakarta, the Ministry of
Health reportedly donated thousands of mosquito nets to the residents
in the affected areas.

[Malaria is well known on Lombok Island, and outbreaks have been
reported in 1997 and 2002. Both _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_
malaria are found on Lombok, and chloroquine resistance has been
reported. Travelers should be advised to use malaria prophylaxis when
visiting Lombok. - Mod.EP]
