Health officials investigating 12 cases of a stomach bug in mid-Wales
have said that 8 cases are linked.
It emerged on Thursday that 12 people were suffering from _Giardia
intestinalis_ in Ceredigion. But health officials said on Friday that
8 cases were linked, while 3 were associated with foreign travel and
one was a "sporadic" case. The source of infection in the 8 linked
cases has not yet been identified.
Ceredigion Council said on Friday that of the 8 linked cases, 5 were
children and 3 were adults. The council added that some of the cases
were detected by screening children and adults associated with the
learning disability unit of Llwyn yr Eos Primary School in
Aberystwyth. The water supply at the affected school was not to
blame, added officials. The team added that the outbreak suggested
person-to-person spread, and it expected a screening process to be
completed early next week.
In a statement following a meeting in Aberaeron on Friday, officials
said: "The initial source of the infection has not been identified,
and at present activities are concentrated on reinforcing hygiene
measures and cleaning procedures at the school."
Dr Mac Walapu, consultant in communicable disease control with the
National Public Health Service for Wales, said: "This is a cluster of
related infections and is unlikely to be an extensive community
problem. People with symptoms should contact their local GP practice
for advice."
Symptoms of _Giardia intestinalis_ include diarrhoea, but it can be
treated by antibiotics with no long-term complications.

[_Giardia lamblia_ is now known as _Giardia intestinalis_. The
outbreak is within 30 kilometers of the outbreak of Cryptosporidia
reported 2 days ago. Giardia is also an intestinal parasite with
animal reservoirs depending on the genotype, and it is possible that
both outbreaks are linked through fecal contamination of the drinking
water. - Mod.EP]
