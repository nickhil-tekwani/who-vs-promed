A 30-year-old man was confirmed to have been infected with the H7N9 avian influenza virus in east China's Zhejiang Province, local health authorities said Friday [6 Dec 2013]. The patient is a native of Anji County, Zhejiang. He is being treated at the First Hospital affiliated with the Medical College of Zhejiang University, said the provincial health department. He is in critical condition with a fever of 39.5 degrees Celsius, said Liang Weifeng, a doctor with the hospital.

In November [2013], the Chinese mainland reported 3 new human H7N9 cases, with 2 in Zhejiang and 1 in southern Guangdong Province. By the end of October [2013], the mainland had reported 136 total cases, including 45 fatalities and 87 others who had recovered.

The Health Department of Zhejiang Province reported on 6 Dec 2013 that Zhejiang reported one new case of human infection with H7N9 avian influenza virus. The patient is a 30-year-old male. Confirmed as a case of H7N9 avian influenza infection on 5 Dec 2013 and now under treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. Up to now, the 2nd half of [November 2013], 4 people had been infected with H7N9 avian influenza virus, including one case of H7N9 bird flu in Jiaxing who died.

Currently the patient and his father are housed in an isolation ward of the hospital. The deputy director Joseph Leung told reporters that the patient's condition was now critical. The patient's family kept 6 chickens, and doctors have speculated that the patient's condition was probably related to this factor, since the birds could be carrying the H7N9 virus. These birds carry the virus.

Hong Kong and China report new H7N9 cases
-----------------------------------------
Health officials in Hong Kong today said they detected a 2nd imported H7N9 flu case, in an 80-year-old man from the mainland, while mainland China reported another new infection, which sickened a 30-year-old man from Zhejiang province. Both of the H7N9 cases reported this week [week ending 6 Dec 2013] have travel ties to Shenzhen, a major city just north of Hong Kong in China's Guangdong province. The new case in Zhejiang, about 800 miles northeast of Guangdong province, further boosts the province's status as China's hardest hit by the H7N9 virus.

Meanwhile, new scientific findings released today suggest that the virus doesn't latch on to human cells strongly enough to pose a pandemic threat, though the virus bears close monitoring for further changes.

Hong Kong's 2nd imported case
-----------------------------
Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said in a statement today [6 Dec 2013] that the 80-year-old man arrived in Hong Kong with 3 family members on 3 Dec 2013 and was admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital for further treatment of a chronic illness. He had been hospitalized in Shenzhen for several days in November for his underlying illness. He didn't have a fever when he was 1st admitted to the hospital. However, his temperature spiked this morning, and healthcare workers isolated him and obtained nasopharyngeal samples, which were positive for H7N9 avian influenza virus. The CHP said the patient is in stable condition, and he will be transferred to and isolated at Princess Margaret Hospital.

The man's family members who accompanied him or visited him in the hospital are asymptomatic, and patients who were in the same cubicle with the man at the hospital, health workers, and visitors are being traced and checked, the CHP said. Health officials are trying to locate the taxi driver who took the man and his family from the border control point to the hospital.

The CHP said surveillance has been enhanced at area hospitals and that border points have implemented prevention and control measures, including thermal imaging systems for body temperature checks of inbound travelers. It added that more staff have been sent to border points to conduct random temperature checks with handheld devices.

A report today [6 Dec 2013] from Xinhua, China's state news agency, said the man is a long-term resident of the mainland, where he had contact with poultry.

Mainland China reports 6th autumn case
--------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the CHP said it has been in contact with mainland officials about the new H7N9 case in Zhejiang province. The man, whose infection was confirmed yesterday [5 Dec 2013], is hospitalized in Hangzhou. The man's illness is China's 6th H7N9 case reported this fall and the 2nd one detected in Zhejiang province in the past week. China has now reported 140 H7N9 cases, 45 of them fatal. Most of the cases were reported earlier this year. After a summer lull the country has reported 6 cases since the end of August [2013]. Only 3 other cases have been reported outside the mainland, one in a Taiwan in a man who had visited the outbreak area for work and 2 in Hong Kong, both involving visitors.

H7N9 study downplays pandemic threat
------------------------------------
In H7N9 research developments, teams from 2 Research Institute labs today [6 Dec 2013] reported that an analysis of the H7N9's hemagglutinin protein shows that it binds only weakly to human-type receptors, which could signal that it still hasn't adapted to become a pandemic threat. The group published its findings in Science.

Using an H7N9 isolate from Shanghai, one lab tested the ability of the virus to bind to different human and avian sialic receptors on host cells. The other lab used X-ray crystallography to explore the structure of the virus's bonds to different avian- and human-type receptors.

The findings show a looser connection with human-type receptors, compared to snug couplings with some avian-type receptors. This led researchers to conclude that despite signs that H7N9 has started adapting to human hosts, it doesn't appear to be an imminent pandemic threat.

Ian Wilson, PhD, who heads the lab that performed the X-ray crystallography studies, said in a Scripps press release yesterday [5 Dec 2013], "These results suggest that we should continue to observe H7N9 and see if it undergoes any changes that make it more likely to spread in the human population."

[It remains uncertain whether the 2nd (imported) case in Hong Kong contracted H7N9 virus infection before or after arrival in Hong Kong. Clarification is awaited. In both of the new H7N9 cases described above, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of infection. The X-ray crystallography analyses reported in Science (http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-12/sri-tse112713.php) support the view that the H7N9 avian influenza virus is not well-adapted to penetrate the human respiratory tract. Most of those infected have other medical conditions that may render them more vulnerable to infection. - Mod.CP
