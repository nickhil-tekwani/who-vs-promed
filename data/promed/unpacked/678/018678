[1] North Korea (via FAO) - outbreak denial

According to FAO, North Korea Denies Avian Influenza Report
-----------------------------------------------
North Korea has denied a report that a woman in its capital Pyongyang
became infected with avian influenza and said it had had no outbreaks of
the disease, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Fri
27 Jan 2006. The group "Rescue the North Korean People Urgent Action
Network" said earlier this week that a woman was infected after chickens
carrying the disease were found in Pyongyang.
"The Ministry of Agriculture ruled out all these kinds of rumors, and there
is no outbreak and no human cases," said Noureddin Mona, who heads the FAO
office in China and also oversees North Korea. North Korea's state media
said in November 2005 that it was stepping up efforts to keep avian
influenza out.
The virus, which scientists fear could mutate into a form that can pass
easily between people, sparking a pandemic, has hit hard in neighboring
China, where there were more than 30 outbreaks in animals last year [2005],
including in the border province of Liaoning. The H5N1 strain of bird flu
has killed more than 80 people since 2003 across Asia and in Turkey.

Turkey: WHO lab confirms 12 human cases of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A London-based World Health Organization (WHO) laboratory has confirmed 12
of the 21 human cases of the lethal bird flu strain in Turkey, the health
ministry has revealed. "The analysis of samples from the remaining cases is
continuing," a statement said on Fri 27 Jan 2006.
Turkish labs have diagnosed a total of 21 people with the H5N1 strain of
the disease, including 4 teenagers who have perished since 1 Jan 2006, the
1st human fatalities of avian influenza outside Southeast Asia and China.
The Ministry said 14 H5N1 carriers had been discharged from hospital after
recovering, and 3 others remained under treatment. "It is encouraging that
there have been no new cases (since Tue 17 Jan 2006), but precautions
should continue," it added.
All but 2 of the human cases in Turkey are children and teenagers aged
between 2 and 18 who were infected after coming into close contact with
sick birds. The 4 dead were all from Dogubeyazit, a remote eastern region
near the border with Iran, where the current outbreak started in December
[2005].

[Up to Wed 25 Jan 2006, WHO continued to give the number of
laboratory-confirmed human cases of H5N1 avian influenza in Turkey as 4
with 2 deaths, in contrast to the figures of 21 cases and 4 deaths quoted
by the Turkish Ministry of Health. The new figure of 12 confirmed cases
from the UK laboratory brings the 2 sets of figures more into line and
suggests that the Turkish case count is accurate. - Mod.CP]

[3] Hong Kong (S.A.R) - increased surveillance

Hong Kong (S.A.R.): Medical Tests for 13 in Village Bird Flu Scare
-----------------------------------------------
13 people in Hong Kong are under medical surveillance, after a wild bird
that died of a suspected H5 influenza infection was found in a village hut
in an area bordering Shenzhen. The Centre for Health Protection is
examining 6 front line staff from the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department (AFCD) and 7 family members who own the village
house and hut where the bird was found. However, none had any symptoms of
disease, said AFCD deputy director Lau Sin-pang on Friday [27 Jan 2006] night.
An Oriental magpie robin was found on Thu 26 Jan 2006 in the privately
owned hut near a village house in Sheung Wo Hang Tsuen, Lau said. A
preliminary test "indicated a suspected case of H5 avian influenza," and
"further confirmatory tests were being conducted," he said. It was not
immediately known whether the robin had the deadly H5N1 strain. The move
comes about a week after another wild bird in the territory became the 1st
in a year to test positive for the deadly H5N1 avian flu strain. Lau said
officials were inspecting 14 poultry farms within 5 km of where the latest
bird was found to see whether the virus has spread. Surveillance of wild
birds in the area has also been stepped up.
"If H5N1 avian influenza virus was confirmed to be found in this Oriental
magpie robin, it might be an indication that the virus exists in the
natural environment," Lau said. Lau stressed the department would maintain
frequent inspections on poultry farms to ensure that proper precautions
against avian influenza had been implemented and that "there is no abnormal
mortality and the chickens show no symptoms of avian influenza."
Commenting on the rare medical surveillance, David Hui, professor of
medicine at Chinese University of Hong Kong said: "This is a proactive move
for the government to examine if there is an effective transmission between
human and wild bird." Hui said the spreading of virus among wild birds is
"not uncommon, especially during the winter," adding it would not be
surprising if more isolated cases were discovered soon. "The key is to
avoid the spread of virus in a wider area," Hui explained.
Lau advised backyard poultry owners to contact his department through the
government's 1823 hotline if they decide to surrender or vaccinate their
chickens. "They should consider giving up backyard farming if biosecurity
measures are found inadequate," Lau said. "Any suspicious outbreak of
disease among their birds or their neighbors' birds, or significant
increase in mortality, should be reported to the AFCD immediately. "We also
strongly advise the public not to set free their pet birds, as their chance
of survival in the wild is minimal." He reminded the public to observe good
personal hygiene, to avoid personal contact with wild birds and live
poultry and to clean hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them.
In response to the 10 Jan 2006 discovery of H5N1 in a dead robin, Hui said
the latest discovery might reinforce the call for reviewing the
surveillance system.
