Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever: Death of Namibian Farmer
---------------------------------------------------------
WINDHOEK: Health authorities believe they have contained an
outbreak of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) that killed a
farmer near Gobabis last week. [The farmer lost his fight against the
hemorrhagic fever on Friday [19 Jan 2001, a week after he was bitten
by a red tick that came from cattle he was transporting to a farm in the
Omaheke region. [His wife, and a worker at the game farm, yesterday
tested negative for CCHF virus after they were admitted to the
Windhoek Central Hospital with CCHF-like symptoms. They are to
remain in the hospital's isolation unit and are being monitored closely.
[The farmer's death sparked panic among people in the Gobabis and
surrounding areas, but the authorities say there is no cause for alarm.
Ministry of Health Permanent Secretary, Dr. Kalumbi Shangula, said
yesterday morning that a team of health workers has been dispatched to
the Omaheke region to "try and contain" the virus as well as to
"monitor people who have been in contact [with the virus for early
symptoms [of disease." But he admitted that his team has yet to
pinpoint the source.
[The farmer's daughter stated that her father had been bitten on the
thigh on Saturday while transporting cattle from nearby farms to his
guest lodge. The next day he [developed symptoms of tick fever. By
Wednesday he was transported to the Windhoek hospital, where his
blood sample was sent to Johannesburg for testing. It came up positive
for CCHF virus. [He did not respond to treatment and died.
The farm has been closed for business and at least 4 police officers are
guarding the entrance. A worker said that despite the outbreak tourists
have been asking to visit the farm where they can see lions, cheetahs,
leopards, hyenas, baboons and other wild animals. The campaign to
contain the virus includes giving information about how it spreads and
dipping animals [to destroy the red tick that transmits CCHF.
Dr. Ockie Oosthuizen, an expert on the virus, said that CCHF occurs
every 5 years [in this area. He has recorded 18 infections since 1984.
Some 60 per cent of cases survived the infections. CCHF virus is
spread to human beings via the tick _Hyalomma marginatum_. CCHF
virus antibodies have been detected in cattle, sheep, and small
mammals across southern Africa without evidence of disease.
Antibodies of CCHF virus have been found in farm workers with no
evidence of the disease.
CCHF has an incubation period of between 2 and 7 days [one day in
this case. Illness is sudden and accompanied by fever, chills, severe
muscular pains, headaches and vomiting. Bleeding develops from the
third to the fifth day, mainly from the nose and mouth. At this stage
the tongue becomes dry and is often coated with dry blood. In the first
few days the patient could have sharp mood swings, and may become
confused and aggressive. After 2 to 4 days, the agitation may be
replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude. Death follows in the
second week of illness if the patient does not [develop an adequate
immune response.
There is no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.
People living in endemic areas should take protective measures,
including avoidance of areas where [the tick vector is prevalent. They
should also regularly examine their clothing for ticks and use repellents.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus is a member of the Genus
_Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_, and it should not be
confused with Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus, which is an unrelated
virus belonging to the family _Filoviridae_. Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever virus -- not the other way round, Congo-Crimean
hemorrhagic fever virus -- is the virus name now approved by the
International Committee on Virus Taxonomy irrespective of the place
of isolation of the virus. - Mod.CP
