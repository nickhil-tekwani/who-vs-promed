Recent positive tests, and ongoing concerns that the disease is spreading throughout NSW [New South Wales], has prompted the Livestock Health and Pest Authorities (LHPA) to encourage all sheep producers to test their rams for ovine brucellosis.

Ovine brucellosis is a venereal disease caused by the bacterium _Brucella ovis_. It causes lumps and scars in the ram's testicle, which can block the flow of sperm. According to Senior District Vet Dan Salmon, many producers are unaware of the disease and the problems it can cause -- reduced fertility or infertility, lower lambing percentages, longer joining and lambing intervals, and consequent economic losses.

"In the late 1990s, testing of all rams in the former Riverina RLPB district (Moulamein and Deniliquin) revealed that ovine brucellosis was present in one third of ram flocks," he said.

"There is no effective treatment for brucellosis and all producers are at risk. Infected rams spread the disease during joining through the ewe or off-season through sodomy.

"Prevention is the key with this disease. Producers should only buy rams from an Ovine Brucellosis Accredited Stud and also regularly check rams."

Producers can easily check their own rams by feeling for abnormal lumps in the rams' testicles. "This should be done twice a year, well in advance of joining and recently after the last joining. This will allow enough time for re-tests if they are needed," Dr Salmon said.

"Any lumps or bumps should be further investigated -- this involves contacting your vet who will organise blood testing. Your vet will also discuss the options available.

"If you are unsure about the rams you have purchased, keep them separate from your home rams until you have them blood tested.

"Also remember that rams often move freely across or through boundary fences, potentially picking up diseases and bringing them back to your property."

Producers wishing to establish a group to combat ovine brucellosis should contact their local LHPA for assistance.

[Brucella ovis_ produces a disease unique to sheep, in which epididymitis and orchitis impair fertility -- the principal economic effect. Occasionally, placentitis and abortion are seen, and there may be perinatal mortality. The disease was 1st described in New Zealand and Australia and has since been reported from many sheep-raising areas of the world.

Rams, as young as 8 weeks, have been infected experimentally by various nonvenereal routes. The disease can be transmitted among rams by direct contact. Active infection in ewes is unusual but has developed after mating with naturally infected rams. Contaminated pastures do not appear to be important in the spread of the disease. Infection frequently persists in rams, and a high percentage shed _B. ovis_ intermittently for several years.

Because not all infected rams show palpable abnormalities of scrotal tissues (and not all cases of epididymitis are due to brucellosis), the remaining rams must be examined further. Rams shedding organisms, but having no lesions, must be identified by culture of semen. Repeated examinations may be necessary to identify intermittent shedders. Microscopic examination of stained semen smears may also be helpful; fluorescent antibody examination is a highly specific diagnostic aid. Serologic tests used for eradication of disease and certification of animals include ELISA, complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, indirect agglutination, and gel diffusion.

Incidence and spread of the disease may be reduced by regular examination of rams before the breeding season and culling of those with obvious genital abnormalities. Because susceptibility in rams increases markedly with age, it is advantageous to keep a young ram flock and isolate noninfected rams from older, possibly infected rams.

Immunization of rams has been practiced extensively in New Zealand using 2 doses of killed _B. ovis_ cells in adjuvant. Because infection in ewes apparently originates almost exclusively from service by infected rams, lamb losses through infection of ewes may be controlled economically by restricting vaccination to rams.

Chlortetracycline and streptomycin used concurrently have affected bacteriologic cures. However, treatment is not economic except in especially valuable rams, and even if infection is eliminated, fertility may remain impaired.
