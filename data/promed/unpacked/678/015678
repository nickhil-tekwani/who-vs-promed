Outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in the Balkan region fell dramatically by 95 percent from 7483 in 2016 to 385 in 2017. The figures confirm that vaccination of cattle -- recommended by EFSA in 2016 -- is the most effective way to contain the disease.

A report published today [19 Feb 2018] by EFSA gives an update on the occurrence of LSD and the effectiveness of vaccination. It also analyses the risk factors for its spread in southeastern Europe. The report is based on data collected by affected countries and those at risk.

However, Alessandro Broglia, a veterinarian at EFSA, warned: "Even if the number of outbreaks has decreased significantly, the disease has not been eliminated from the region yet, and, therefore, we need to remain vigilant."

In 2017, most of the outbreaks -- 379 -- were reported in areas of Albania where the vaccination programme had not yet been completed. Few outbreaks occurred elsewhere, with 2 in Greece and 4 in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

One of the factors responsible for the spread of LSD is an increase in the number of insects that transmit the disease, as a result of warm temperatures.

Experts also concluded that in Greece, the risk of infection is 6 times higher among farmed animals that have access to outdoor space than in those kept indoors. This is because the former group is more exposed to transmitting insects.

The cooperation and commitment of countries involved in the data collection was crucial for the report. EFSA used data provided by Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece, Kosovo [1], Montenegro, Serbia and Turkey.

[The relevant, full (33 page) EFSA scientific report "Lumpy skin disease II. Data collection and analysis," richly graphically illustrated (maps, curves, tables), approved on 29 Jan 2018 and published on 19 Feb 2018, is available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2018.5176/epdf.

While LSD has reportedly been halted in the Balkans, the disease continued its activity during 2017 within Russia's territory along the border with West Kazakhstan. Its circulation in Kazakhstan was suspected and remains to be elucidated (see 20170831.5287377, 20170830.5282993, and 20170825.5274779).
