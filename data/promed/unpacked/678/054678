Thousands of pigs face destruction because of Classical Swine Fever (CSF).
Restrictions have been placed on the movement of all livestock in the areas
affected by the outbreak of swine fever. The highly contagious pig disease
has been found on several farms across the UK.
Farmers must obtain a special licence to transport cows, sheep and other
animals from the "surveillance areas", the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) revealed. The move followed a European Commission
ban of live English pig exports following the recent outbreak of CSF on
farms in East Anglia. It is the first outbreak in the UK for 14 years.
The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) has already warned a ban could have
a "devastating effect" on the industry, which is worth BPS 12m in exports
and accounts for 15% of the market.
A MAFF spokesman said the livestock restriction order was standard
procedure. "There is no risk to other species, but CSF is very contagious
and can be easily spread through pig manure or pig urine," he said. "The
other livestock can get it on their hooves and track it out, infecting more
pigs, and that is what we want to avoid."
Agriculture minister Baroness Hayman met with pig farmers in Suffolk and
stressed the ban was purely "precautionary". "The EC has made clear it is a
temporary ban and it is not a ban on meat exports which is very important,"
she said.
Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain had already banned the import of British
pigs to their countries while awaiting the EC decision.
Under EU law, pigs on farms with CSF must be destroyed.
Six thousand pigs in England have already been slaughtered, with a further
10 000 set for destruction.
The European Commission's Veterinary Standing Committee will meet to
discuss the ban on 22 August.

US restricts UK pig imports
Thousands of pigs have been destroyed because of classical Swine fever
(CSF) in the UK. The United States is to put on hold all shipments of swine
products from the UK.
The European Commission has already imposed a ban on live English pig
exports and pig sperm, used for breeding, until the end of August at least.
Pork exports are as yet unaffected.
Lisa Ferguson, a spokeswoman for the US Agriculture Department (USDA) said
there were concerns about the transmission of the disease to America's
livestock population, adding the hold on shipments was "temporary".
Several shipments are known to already be in transit and American officials
are said to be seeking more information about their origins from the UK
Ministry of Agriculture.
Ms. Ferguson said each import would now be dealt with on an individual
basis and that would remain the case until the risk of disease was over.
Canada is introducing similar restrictions.
Andrew Garvey of the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) said he respected
countries' wishes to impose a temporary ban, but hoped the export of
livestock would resume as quickly as possible. "This disease is very
virulent, and we understand any country minimising the risk of bringing
that disease into their own country," he said. "But we do want to resolve
this issue very quickly, and our hope is that we can negotiate for exports
to continue from areas of the country not infected."
He said the industry and the Ministry of Agriculture were working "very
closely together" to minimise the spread of disease and restore confidence.
Over 100 ministry staff are now investigating the source of the outbreak in
East Anglia, he pointed out.
