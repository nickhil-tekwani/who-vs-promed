It would be good to know if the schoochildren had been on any field
trips that involved petting of or close priximity to farm animals
(Merymead Farms, PA outbreak, 2000) [see ProMED-mail

[The epidemiology related to the cases in question is not available as
yet. As pointed out by Moderator ES in ProMed-mail posting
20010923.2301, however, events such as county fairs and petting zoos
that put people, particularly children, into close contact with farm
animals present special problems with hygiene because of the
informality of the environment. CDC, on 20 Apr 2001, has published
guidelines offering basic precautionary measures:
