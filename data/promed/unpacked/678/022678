There are 18 cases of dengue fever recorded throughout Brunei this month
[October 2005], with 6 of those cases occurring in the Temburong district,
RTB [Radio Television Brunei] reported last night [27 Oct 2005].
Yesterday [27 Oct 2005], a talk on the illness was held at the Muafakat
Hall in Bangar, Temburong for the district's penghulus, kampung ketuas and
the heads of longhouses. Also present at the talk was the Assistant
Temburong District Officer, Awg Shahminan bin Hj Tengah.
The talk was delivered by a senior public health officer, Awg Kamaluddin
bin Hj Yassin, and was part of the Health Services Department's campaign to
enhance public awareness on dengue fever and its prevention measures. The
Health Services Department continues to monitor the situation in Brunei
following the rise in the number of dengue fever cases in the region, the
report added.
Dengue fever is caused by the bite of the _Aedes_ mosquito. Symptoms of the
disease are headaches, fever, skin rashes, muscle and joint pains, and pain
around the eye sockets. Members of the public, however, should [not] be
unduly alarmed, as every preventive measure has been undertaken by the
department. They should also help in preventing the spread of dengue fever
by keeping a clean environment, RTB said.

Over a dozen cases of dengue fever have been reported in 2 south Texas
counties. City officials held an emergency meeting on Wednesday [26 Oct
2005] afternoon to ask leaders in all Valley cities to take the necessary
precautions to prevent further spread of the disease.
Dengue fever is spread by mosquitoes but can only be developed in
artificial items such as flower pots or tires containing standing water.
Health officials do believe the disease migrated to the states from across
the border.
Some symptoms of dengue fever are coughing, fever and body aches.
If you develop these flu-like symptoms, the Hidalgo County Health
Department recommends you ask your private doctor to check for dengue
fever. You can also contact the health department at 383-6221.

In October 2005 alone, DMC has received 90 patients with dengue. Of these,
53 are from Ludhiana, 29 from Jalandhar, one each from Ferozepur, Moga,
Muktsar and Fatehgarh Sahib and 2 each from Kapurthala and Kangra. While 49
patients have already been discharged, 36 are still admitted. There were 5
deaths [Names deleted].
Meanwhile, at Guru Teg Bahadur Charitable Hospital, 10 patients are
admitted. ''We have been getting 4 to 5 patients in OPD. For past one week,
we have had at least 30 suspected cases of dengue,'' said Medical
Superintendent Dr R.S. Sodhi.
Similarly, at CMC, 16 patients were admitted today [28 Oct 2005], of which
2 were released by evening. One of the patients is a child and is from
Jalandhar. At Dewan Hospital, 2 confirmed cases and 3 cases with low blood
platelet count have been identified.

Health Department has so far visited the houses of 34 patients. Also, the
fogging of various areas is being done, and literature on dengue is being
distributed.

Dengue tightened its grip over the city on Monday [24 Oct 2005], as the
total number of cases rose to 463. In a meeting held at the MCD House,
municipal councilors discussed the spread of dengue and measures taken to
contain the fever.
The data available with the MCD's health department shows that, out of the
463 cases, 131 are from outside Delhi. In the city, the highest number of
cases have been reported from west zone followed by central zone, which has 59.
Najafgarh follows with 55 cases. Rohinizone has reported 31 cases, and the
number of cases stand at 20 in south zone. Paharganj zone has reported just
2 cases.
City zones follow with 6 and Narela with 7 cases. MCD councilors asserted
in the House meeting that the health department should initiate awareness
campaigns much before the season.
"The department has taken preventive measures when the season is at its
peak. These efforts should have been made before," councilors from the
opposition benches said.

Dengue, which caused a large number of deaths in the aftermath of the
floods, appears to be on the rise again. 2 deaths were reported from a
reputed south Mumbai hospital last week [3rd week October 2005], while in
Kandivili, a 43-year-old housewife died a couple of days ago of the disease.
From south Mumbai's up-market homes to suburban sprawls, cases of the
deadly dengue disease with its, at times, severe complications, such as
internal bleeding and shock, are showing up across the city. Doctors
believe water stored at construction sites could be the breeding ground for
the _Aedes_ mosquito, which spreads the [dengue] virus.
But the municipal authorities don't believe there is [a] reason to hit the
panic button yet. "We have found sporadic instances of the diseases across
the city," said additional municipal commissioner Vijaysinh Patankar,
adding that the incidence is not more than last year's [2004] corresponding
figures.
But Dr. Hemant Thacker, who consults at Jaslok and Bhatia Hospitals, says
that his clinics have seen a resurgence in the number of dengue cases in
the last 10 days.
"At present, we have a 22-year-old south Mumbai resident recuperating at
Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, who has a very low platelet count," he added. The
youngster's family had a tough time gathering blood donors for fresh
platelet transfusion on Monday [24 Oct 2005] night.
The dengue viruses DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4, spread through _Aedes_
mosquitoes, which are also known as Tiger mosquitoes because of their
prominent yellow stripes. As these mosquitoes breed in fresh water, they
are found in water tanks and drums that are stagnant for a week.
The disease is considered a curse of the poor classes, who are forced to
store water in drums due to erratic supply. "But this year [2005], we are
seeing many patients from the affluent classes as well," says Dr. Thacker.
An 8-year-old child from Borivli was a confirmed case of dengue in Lilavati
Hospital, Bandra. 2 Navi Mumbai residents who were admitted to the same
hospital were discharged on Monday [24 Oct 2005].
Dr. S Jairam of JJ Hospital provides a likely answer for the on-off dengue
situation. "While on a clinical basis doctors may suspect dengue, there
aren't enough confirmed cases," he says.

The official death toll from Singapore's worst dengue fever outbreak has
jumped to 19 this year [2005] with the number of reported cases now
approaching 13 000.
The health ministry says 4 men, 3 in their 60s and one aged 49, have
succumbed over the past month [October 2005] to the mosquito-borne disease,
which continues to infect dozens of people daily in the city-state.
A spokeswoman for the health ministry says the government is "hopeful,"
because the number of new cases appeared to be tapering off from more than
100 a day at the peak of the outbreak.
According to the Straits Times, the average number of new cases a day has
fallen to 56.
Among the latest confirmed fatalities, 2 men died this week [final week
October 2005], another passed away last week and the 4th death happened in
September 2005 but was belatedly reported to the health ministry.
Singapore has set aside USD 18 million to battle the outbreak and formed a
panel of international experts to advise the government on how to combat a
disease normally associated with poorer tropical countries.

Cases of dengue fever in the capital city are on the rise, even though the
reverse is true in most other States.
Health Ministry director of disease control, Dr. Ramlee Rahmat, said
suspected dengue cases in Kuala Lumpur rose from 114 to 128 over the past
month [October 2005].
However, most States registered a decline, including Selangor (down to 289
from 319), Penang (190 from 223), Johor (88 from 99) and Perak (85 from 93).
States which saw an increase were Sabah (from 45 to 52), Malacca (25 to
29), Perlis (7 to 9) and Putrajaya (6 to 8).
Dr. Ramlee said dengue claimed 2 lives last week [3rd week October 2005]
and another several weeks ago, bringing the total fatalities to 81 this month.
The latest death last Saturday involved a 31-year-old Indian woman from
Sungai Siput, Perak. "She fell ill on 18 Oct 2005 and received treatment at
the Sungai Siput Hospital, 3 days later, before being referred to the Ipoh
Hospital on the same day. "She died the following day, and was diagnosed
with dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]."
Another victim, a 4-year-old Indian boy from Triang, Pahang, fell ill on 13
Oct 2005 and died at the Temerloh Hospital, 6 days later. He was also
diagnosed with DHF.
Dr. Ramlee said a 46-year-old man from Taman Rawang Perdana died several
weeks ago.
He said 1064 suspected dengue cases were reported last week [3rd week
October 2005], as compared to 1172 the previous week, a 9.2 percent reduction.
The number of dengue cases in the country on 22 Oct 2005 was 32 126. Of
this, 9381 were confirmed dengue cases, while another 1634 were dengue
hemorrhagic fever [DHF] cases.
Dr. Ramlee urged local councils and the public to step up the fight against
dengue by making sure public places, buildings and homes did not become
breeding grounds for the _Aedes_ mosquitoes, especially during the festive
season.
Meanwhile, the Selangor Government allocated RM 20 million [approximately
USD 5.3 million] in the middle of the year for dengue prevention. Its State
Tourism, Health and Consumer Affairs Committee chairman Datuk Dr. Lim
Thuang Seng said it was in addition to the RM 20 million provided for the
task this year [2005]. The 1st RM 20 million, he said, was disbursed to all
districts in the State. He said: "The additional allocation, among others,
is to repair drains, roads and upgrade old facilities. Before the holidays,
we want school administrators to ensure that their compounds and premises
are free of containers, vases and tires."
Dr. Lim said Shah Alam, Subang Jaya and Petaling Jaya were among the
municipalities that recorded the largest number of dengue cases last month
[September 2005].

Dengue fever cases are still increasing in Costa Rica
-----------------------------------------------
Costa Rica has reported more than 31 000 cases of dengue fever and 46 cases
of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) this year [2005], Health Vice-Minister
Dr. Francisco Cubillo said last Tuesday [18 Oct 2005].
The figures reported exceed by around 3000 cases the last report one month
ago [September 2005], which indicated there were 27 369 people affected.
Dr. Cubillo told newsmen that the heavy rainfalls that affected the country
washed out mosquito breeding places.
However, he stated that preventive measures will be maintained, because
there is plenty of stagnant water after the rainy season.
The central Pacific area and the Atlantic coast account for more than 80
percent of the cases.
In order to fight the epidemics, the government initiated various
campaigns, among them one called "Dengue-free seal" ("Sello libre de
dengue"), in which distinction is awarded to those households visited by
healthcare workers certifying that there are no mosquito breeding sites.
The death toll for this disease is 2 persons. Authorities confirmed the
deaths of a 29-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man because of dengue
hemorrhagic fever. No deaths caused by dengue fever had been reported since
1999 in this country.
