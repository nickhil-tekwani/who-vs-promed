Angola: critical stage in Marburg battle says WHO
-------------------------------------------------
Angola is at a critical stage in its fight against [the outbreak of Marburg
haemorrhagic fever] and must step up its drive to bring the disease under
control, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Sat 23 Apr 2005. "The
chain of transmission is being broken as we speak, but this is the most
critical time in terms of response. We need to be even more intense over
the coming days," Mike Ryan, the head of WHO's alert and response
operations, told a teleconference.
Angolan officials said they were flying in more local medical staff to work
with international teams battling the [Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak]
in hopes of regaining the trust of a scared and suspicious population. Some
residents of Uige province -- the centre of the Marburg outbreak that has
killed 244 people -- have stoned WHO vehicles and spread rumours that
foreigners brought the virus into the area.
"It was crucial for us to increase the number of Angolans in the team,"
deputy health minister Jose Van Dunem told Reuters in the capital Luanda.
"We need to improve people's confidence and trust in the health community."
He said [the Marburg haemorrhagic fever outbreak] was under control and
restricted to one province, though there were a handful of cases elsewhere
among travellers who had returned from the region.
Laboratory tests had shown some cases previously thought to be Marburg
fever were not, bringing the total number of known cases down to 264 from
266 on Thursday, he said.
In Uige, WHO was not willing to describe the outbreak as contained but said
both attacks on its workers and the number of new cases were dropping.
"We're moving back into areas we'd pulled out of because of tension," said
WHO spokesman Dave Daigle by telephone. "People are still dying but the
numbers are falling off."
Pierre Formenty, the WHO's top expert on haemorrhagic fevers, said doctors
were tracking about 300 people believed to have had contact with Marburg
victims but that on the whole the picture was improving. "It is just a good
feeling ... maybe things are going to get better," he told the
teleconference. But he said officials remained concerned about undetected
pockets of the [disease] and about the possibility that it could spread as
traditional healers offer injections -- sometimes with unhygienic needles
-- that local people believe may protect them from infection.
Around Uige, teams continue to go out to local communities to persuade
families not to care for the sick at home. Many victims contracted the
disease through treating sick relatives or preparing their bodies for burial.
Angolan health workers who speak Portuguese or local languages will help in
this process, Van Dunem said, and the WHO said it would welcome their
arrival. "We need all the help we can get," said Daigle. "Some of them are
already helping out with infection control and with the surveillance teams.
And they will learn new skills that they can use next time."
