[Since the event started in June 2013, 12 outbreaks have been reported, 6 of which have been resolved, and 6 are still on-going. The affected swine population was as follows: 1256 susceptible, 538 cases, 432 deaths, 516 destroyed, and 0 slaughtered http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015373_20140613_172642.pdf.

In the Andean sub-region, which comprises 5 countries, (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), livestock production contributes significantly to the economy, with swine production not far behind cattle production. However, swine production, while significant, is primarily limited to small farmers and backyard production. Nevertheless, the countries of the Andean sub-region agreed to participate in the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Continental plan to eradicate CSF. The goal is to eradicate the disease by 2020 http://www.rlc.fao.org/es/proyectos/control-ppc-paises-andinos.

Given that the 1st outbreaks associated with this event were located near the border with Venezuela and that one of the likely sources for the origin of the infection was the illegal movement of animals, it would be both interesting and useful to have current information on the CSF control programs being implemented in Venezuela and Colombia. - Mod.CRD
