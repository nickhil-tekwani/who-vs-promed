Measures preventing FMD introduction into the Russian Federation
----------------------------------------------------------------
Due to an outbreak of FMD [foot-and-mouth disease] in the
Akmolinskaya Oblast [Aqmola] of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the
following measures shall be immediately taken:
1. Control of vehicles transporting livestock consignments from the
Republic of Kazakhstan to the Russian Federation [RF] shall be enhanced.
2. Collection and disposal of separations (including food waste)
shall be controlled in the international sea- and air- ports, at
border railway and auto stations.
3. Complete veterinary examination shall be provided for controlled
consignments transported from the Republic of Kazakhstan by all modes
of transport (including hand luggage, luggage, posting) in order to
prevent banned products from coming into the RF.
4. Disinfection and washing units at border checkpoints used for
veterinary and sanitary treatment of motor transport shall be made operational.
5. Control of motor transport entering the from the Republic of
Kazakhstan shall be enhanced only after disinfection of its running gear.
6. Disinfection barriers for treating footwear of passengers coming
from the Republic of Kazakhstan shall be kept in working order by the
checkpoint administrations.
7. Strict border control of movements of farm animals, products, and
raw materials of animal origin, forage shall be provided in the RF
Subjects bordering on Kazakhstan.
8. Increase veterinary and sanitary security on livestock farms.
9. Arrange, if necessary, isolated keeping of animals that
uncontrollably crossed the state border between the RF and the
Republic of Kazakhstan or were returned from the adjacent territory.
Usage of such animals is regulated by the Rosselkhoznadzor
territorial administration.
10. Arrange random blood sampling from FMD susceptible animals in the
RF Subjects bordering on the Republic of Kazakhstan for further FMD
monitoring in the FGI ARRIAH [Federal Centre for Animal Health] (Vladimir).
11. Inform heads of transport companies that it is inadmissible to
throw out dead animals, food waste, litters, and feed leftovers
(while being transported from the Republic of Kazakhstan) in the RF territory.
12. Establish strict veterinary control of animal keeping in holdings
of all forms of ownership located within a 20-km [12 mi] radius of
sea ports, airports, railway and auto stations, plants processing
imported products and animal raw materials, and companies dealing
with foreign tourists.
13. It shall be banned to use food wastes as animal feed, they shall
be destroyed under control of checkpoint administration during
international transportation from the Republic of Kazakhstan by air,
by sea, by train, by car.
14. Use widely the mass media for educating people on FMD
prophylaxis. The Rosselkhoznadzor licences earlier issued for import
of livestock into Russia from Kazakhstan shall be suspended until the
epidemic situation on FMD in the Republic of Kazakhstan is specified.

[Kazakhstan notified the OIE on 17 Jun 2010 of a single outbreak of
FMD in cattle in the village Novodolinka, Kokchetav (Aqmola)
province, northern Kazakhstan (report and map available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9387>).
The said immediate notification related to the serotype as "Not
typed"; in the meantime, it has become (unofficially) known that the
FMDV strain involved is serotype O and that sample(s) have been
dispatched to the FMD reference laboratory in Vladimir, Russia (FGI
ARRIAH) for further confirmation and genotyping. No follow-up report
from Kazakhstan, including the said information, is available yet. In
its previous posting, ProMED-mail indicated that the results of the
genotyping, in particular the relationship of the Kazakh isolate to
the serotype O strains currently circulating in China, South Korea,
Japan, and Mongolia, were anticipated with interest. They still are.

Russia's concern about the risk of FMD introduction is fully
justified. From unofficial, well-informed sources we have obtained
the following complementary data:
1. In February 2010, people in Kokchetav (Aqmola) were complaining
about considerable acute mortalities in lambs a few days after birth.
Such incidence (sometimes caused by FMD-induced pancarditis in
lambs/kids), could be one of the typical manifestations of FMD in
sheep; allegedly, no effort to exclude such a possibility by
epidemiological, pathological, or virological investigations has been
attempted.
2. In March 2010, suspicion of FMD in south Kazakhstan led to
livestock markets being closed and police checking cars on roads. The
event was not officially reported and results of tests, in case
performed, are not known. This event was preceded by unofficial
information from neighbouring Kyrgyzstan concerning suspected FMD
outbreaks in Chui, Talas, and Batken during the winter/spring months
of 2009/2010 (Kyrgyzstan last FMD reports to the OIE date back to 2007/2008).
3. Kazakhstan stopped, since the beginning of 2010, FMD vaccinations
in its northern provinces: Kustanay, North Kazakhstan, Kokchetav
(Aqmola), and Pavlodar, bordering Russia. The vaccination figures for
2009 are not clear. It is assumed that the current outbreak will lead
the Kazakh authorities to resume vaccinations in the north.

The pieces of information above remain to be confirmed, explained, or
otherwise.

Since May 2010, mass mortality in saiga antelopes was observed in
west Kazakhstan. Information from official sources (but no OIE
report) mentioned pasteurellosis as the causal disease. However, past
experience in Kazakhstan showed that FMD virus could cause such
events; it would be helpful to note if FMD has been excluded in the
sick/dead antelopes by laboratory investigations. - Mod.AS]
