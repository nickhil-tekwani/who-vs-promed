The number of cases of salmonellosis has increased after it was 1st detected in Perry County, Missouri on Mon 5 Aug 2018.

According to the Perry County Memorial Hospital, as of Mon 20 Aug 2018, there were 52 cases of salmonellosis. Sheila Hahs, the Perry County Health Department communicable disease coordinator, said they are seeing fewer and fewer cases as time goes on. She said they are also starting to think that some of the cases they are seeing now might be secondary cases.

She said they still stress being careful with any job around food or just cooking at home, and the importance of washing your hands. The ages of those affected ranged from 2 to 68 years. The hospital said the 1st cases came through the emergency room and through physician offices.

According to the hospital, 3 people required acute hospital admission, 2 short-term hospital observation, and treatment, and one case has been transferred to a Cape Girardeau hospital. The others are recovering with medication and hydration at home. The lab director reported the case information to local and state health officials according to state law. The health department began immediately preparing the investigation of this outbreak and will be handling the evidence that will hopefully determine the source and cause of the illnesses.

Dr. David Kapp with Perryville Family Community Care said the symptoms will usually take care of themselves but, "the most important thing is to try and prevent dehydration, so lots of fluids; you can take electrolytes solutions," said Dr. Kapp.

The Perry County Department of Health and Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services are conducting an investigation into the outbreak.

Missouri authorities are investigating a potential connection between an ongoing salmonella outbreak and a church picnic. The Southeast Missourian reports that the number of people confirmed sick in Perry County has risen to 50.

Sheila Hahs is the Perry County Health Department communicable-disease coordinator. She says a cause hasn't yet been determined. Hahs says the county health agency is working with the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which is surveying those who attended the St. Vincent de Paul Seminary picnic earlier this month [August 2018]. Hahs says the county Health Department will conduct follow-up interviews with those who were ill.

Megan Hopkins is a spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. She says people can help curtail the spread of the infection by increasing basic hygiene practices.

[A church picnic would be an ideal setting for the spread of a foodborne disease, especially in the warm weather of the summer. The key questions to ask those afflicted and controls are "where did you eat," and "what did you eat" during the 3 or so days prior to onset of illness. - Mod.LL
