Outbreak of suspected vivax malaria continues to spread in Singapore
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is currently
investigating a 3rd malaria cluster involving 4
cases of suspected local transmission, near a row
of shophouses located at the junction of
Sembawang Road and Admiralty Road East. The 1st
case is a 24-year-old Singaporean woman who works
in the area. Her illness started on 30 Jun 2009
and she was admitted to hospital on 20 Jul 2009.
She does not have any recent travel history or past history of malaria.

The 2nd and 3rd cases involve colleagues -- a
49-year-old Singaporean man and a 40-year-old
Singaporean woman. They had frequented a
coffeeshop at the row of shophouses. The male
patient fell sick on 11 Jul 2009 and was admitted
to hospital 4 days later. His colleague fell ill
on 12 Jul 2009 and was hospitalised on 17 Jul
2009. The 4th case is a 24-year-old male foreign
worker who was picked up during MOH's active case
finding in the vicinity. He stayed at a nursery
beside the row of shophouses and 1st had symptoms
on 12 Jun 2009. He was admitted to hospital on Tuesday [28 Jul 2009].

MOH said in a statement that the 1st 3 cases have
since recovered, while the 4th case is currently warded in CDC.

This latest cluster is not related to the 2
earlier clusters as none of the 4 cases had
visited Jurong Island or Mandai/Sungei Kadut prior to their illness.

Since the outbreak, MOH has initiated vector
control operations at the site. Larviciding of
potential mosquito breeding habitats and trapping
operations of adult mosquitoes have been carried
out. 13 adult Anopheles mosquitoes were found,
but all tested by the Environmental Health
Institute to be negative for malaria parasites.
Mass fogging of the area too has been carried
out. The NEA is monitoring the situation closely
and will continue with intensive vector control operations.

MOH also is monitoring the situation closely and
will update the public on any new developments.

Clusters of suspected local malaria transmission
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is currently
investigating 2 clusters of suspected local
malaria transmission involving a total of 14
people. As of 6 Jun 2009, all but 2 cases have
been discharged. All 14 cases had no recent
travel history overseas, suggesting that there is
possible local transmission in the affected areas.

Malaria cluster at Jurong Island
--------------------------------
The 1st cluster involves 5 cases comprising male
foreign workers aged between 25 to 37 years at
Jurong Island. The cases had onset of illness
between 3 to 25 May 2009 with main symptoms such
as fever, headache and chills. 4 of the cases
stayed at a dormitory on Jurong Island and work
at the same site on Jurong Island. The 5th case
works on Jurong Island close to the dormitory and
worksite of the other 4 cases.

Malaria cluster at Sungei Kadut/ Mandai
---------------------------------------
The 2nd cluster involves 9 cases aged between 20
to 40 years in the Sungei Kadut/Mandai area
comprising 8 foreign workers in different
dormitories and 1 full-time national serviceman.
The cases had onset of illness between 16 and 30
May 2009 with symptoms such as fever, headache and chills.

Inspections by National Environment Agency (NEA)
------------------------------------------------
NEA has conducted inspections at the worksites
and dormitories of the workers and its
surrounding areas. Adult mosquito trapping and
search and destroy operations are continuing. NEA
has also directed the dormitory operators and
their pest control operators to carry out
residual spraying to all blocks both inside and
outside the dormitories, night thermal fogging and adult light trapping.

MOH is monitoring the situation closely and will
update the public on any new developments.

MOH's advice to the public
--------------------------
Malaria, like dengue fever, is a mosquito-borne
disease and the best way to prevent malaria is to
take precautionary measures against mosquitoes
and prevent their breeding. Persons diagnosed
with malaria should be isolated from further
mosquito bites so as to reduce the risk of further transmission of the disease.

Further cases diagnosed from 7 Jun 2009 until 29 Jul 2009
---------------------------------------------------------
One more case of vivax malaria has been confirmed
20 Jun 2009 and added to the malaria cluster at
Jurong Island. He is a 46-year-old foreign
construction worker who works and stays at Jurong Island.

The 23rd case of vivax malaria has been confirmed
and added to the malaria cluster at Sungei Kadut/Mandai Estate.

The 16 Jul 2009 the Ministry of Health confirmed
one more case of vivax malaria. The patient is a
55-year-old foreign construction worker who stays
at Jalan Gali Batu in Mandai and works at the Seletar Camp.

On 26 Jul 2009 one more case of vivax malaria has
been confirmed and added to the malaria cluster
at Sungei Kadut/Mandai Estate. The case is a
21-year-old foreign construction worker who previously lived in Mandai Estate.

[The outbreak has been diagnosed as _Plasmodium
vivax_. Local transmission of malaria in
Singapore was last seen in 2003 (Tambuyah PA.
Singapore Med J
2003;44:336-7,
<http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4407/4407e2.pdf>;
Fisher D. Singapore Med J 2005;46:596-7,
<http://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4611/4611e2.pdf>), but
the risk of local transmission from imported
cases and asymptomatic migrant gametocyte
carriers constantly exist due to the climate and
presence of local Anopheles vectors. This can
explain autochthonous transmission. It is
noteworthy that the statements from the Ministry
of Health mention that the outbreaks seems to
originate in settlements of migrant construction
workers. If these come from malaria endemic areas
and are asymptomatic gametocyte carrier, this
explains the start of local transmission.

_P.vivax_ can be confused with _P.knowlesi_, a
malaria species present in Macaca irus monkeys
and increasingly found to also cause infections
in humans in Southeast Asia. _Macaca irus_ is
widespread in the Penang peninsula and
_P.knowlesi_ has been reported from Malaysia.

Human infection with _P.knowlesi_ has been found
in Singapore and it was speculated that the
infection came from the numerous free-ranging
monkeys found in the city (Ng T et al. Emerg
Infect Dis. 2008;14:814-6,
<http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2600232>).
The authorities have initiated a vector control
campaign by mass fogging. ­ Mod.EP]
