YELLOW FEVER - AFRICA (17): COMMENT

Regarding ProMED-mail post "Yellow fever - Africa (16): Ethiopia, Niger 20130609.1762775" and in response to the previous posting on yellow fever in Cameroon "Yellow fever - Africa (14): Cameroon, Niger 20130425.1672764," I would like to bring to your attention additional information regarding diagnosis of yellow fever cases in central Africa.

Surveillance for yellow fever is conducted by national authorities in which suspect cases are identified and have a blood specimen taken. Initial laboratory confirmation is generally accomplished by testing of serum for virus-specific IgM antibodies within countries where facilities are available to conduct the test. However, specimens having an IgM-positive result at national level are then to be forwarded to the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, which serves as the regional laboratory for confirmation of yellow fever diagnoses. This 2nd level of confirmation allows specimens to undergo a comprehensive testing algorithm including: 1. Differential IgM serology for additional Flaviviruses; 2. Plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT); and 3. Virus isolation.

Case definitions and the laboratory confirmation algorithm were revised in 2010 in recognition of the fact that multiple Flaviviruses (that is, dengue fever, chikungunya [an Alphavirus], West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever [a Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae], CCHF [a Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae] co-circulate in yellow fever endemic areas and pose diagnostic challenges for conventional IgM immunoassays due to serological cross-reactivity.

In these circumstances, the number of IgM-positive cases at the national level often exceeds the number confirmed by additional testing at the regional laboratory. Discrepancies in confirmed case numbers may persist if data are not harmonized between the national and regional laboratories.

[ProMED thanks Dr Luce for the explanation of how the field surveillance and laboratory support for diagnosis operate in central Africa.

A smoothly functioning and well integrated system is essential for timely detection and diagnosis of cases that permit rapid mobilization of vaccination campaigns, particularly in regions where the proportion of previously vaccinated individuals is low. One must recognize the logistical challenge in maintaining constant surveillance efforts in geographically isolated areas endemic for yellow fever in Africa.
