This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Burgas region, Rezovo village, Tsarevo municipality, Burgas
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Jan 2011
Outbreak status: continuing
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 92 / 3 / 0 / 92 / 0
Sheep and goats / 77 / 0 / 0 / 77 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the analysis made from the samples
collected on 30 Dec 2010 by the OIE Reference Laboratory, Institute
for Animal Health, Pirbright, United Kingdom, indicate that this FMD
virus is of serotype O, topotype ME-SA, strain PanAsia-2ANT-10, which
has more than 99.5 percent affinity with samples isolated in 2010 in
Iran and Turkey and is most closely related to the FMD virus having
circulated in Turkey in 2010 (O/TUR/18/2010- 99.84 percent identity).

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out, movement control inside the country,
screening, zoning, disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s), no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: control of wildlife reservoirs

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: FMD National Reference Laboratory (National
laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 17 Jan 2011 / positive
Cattle / real-time PCR / 17 Jan 2011 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Under the heading 'Suspension of status: "FMD free Member without
vaccination status"' OIE published the following notification:

"Bulgaria
---------
Following a report received from the OIE Delegate of Bulgaria on an
outbreak of FMD in Kosti Village (province of Burgas), the "FMD free
Member where vaccination is not practised" status for Bulgaria as
recognised by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates in terms of
Resolution X in May 1998, is suspended with effect from 7 Jan 2011".

The conditions for the recovery of Bulgaria's free status, including
a timetable, are laid out in article 8.5.9. of OIE's International
Animal Health Code.

According to the Bulgarian report above, the causative agent was an
FMD virus strain most closely related to the FMD virus which has
circulated in Turkey in 2010. The initial notification of the
Bulgarian outbreak, dated 7 Jan 2011, indicated that the 3 infected
wild boars "were shot during the normal hunting season in an area
located at around 2 km [1.2 mi] from the Bulgarian border with the
Republic of Turkey." This, and obviously all (unofficial) reports
discriminating Turkey's Thrace region as the origin of the Bulgarian
outbreak, will deserve a cautious examination of the current FMD
status of Thrace, Turkey's European territory neighbouring Bulgaria.

After many years of invested efforts, with significant support from
the EU (EUFMD Commission), the Thrace region in Turkey has been
recognised by the OIE as an "FMD free zone with vaccination." The
official announcement was published by the OIE in June 2010,
following and in line with Resolution No. 15 of OIE's 78th General
Session, Paris, May 2010. The free zone with vaccination (Thrace) was
"designated by the Delegate of Turkey in documents addressed to the
Director General in November 2009 and in March 2010."

The conditions for the establishment of an "FMD free zone where
vaccination is practised" are detailed in article 8.5.5. of the Code,
available at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.8.5.htm>.
The text is as follows:

"Article 8.5.5. FMD free zone where vaccination is practised
------------------------------------------------------------
An FMD free zone where vaccination is practised can be established in
either an FMD free country where vaccination is not practised or in a
country of which parts are infected. In defining such zones the
principles of Chapter 4.3. should be followed. Susceptible animals in
the FMD free zone where vaccination is practised should be protected
from neighbouring countries or zones if they are of a lesser animal
health status by the application of animal health measures that
effectively prevent the entry of the virus, taking into consideration
physical or geographical barriers. These measures may include a
protection zone.

To qualify for inclusion in the list of FMD free zones where
vaccination is practised, a Member should:
1. have a record of regular and prompt animal disease reporting;
2. send a declaration to the OIE that within the proposed FMD free zone:
a. there has been no outbreak of FMD for the past 2 years,
b. no evidence of FMDV circulation has been found during the past 12 months,
3. supply documented evidence that:
a. surveillance for FMD and FMDV infection in accordance with
Articles 8.5.42. to 8.5.48. is in operation; (see surveillance
articles at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/en_chapitre_1.8.5.htm#article_1.8.5.42.>),
b. regulatory measures for the early detection, prevention, and
control of FMD have been implemented,
c. routine vaccination is carried out for the purpose of the prevention of FMD,
d. the vaccine used complies with the standards described in the
Terrestrial Manual and is appropriate for the strains of virus
currently circulating;
4. describe in detail and supply documented evidence that these are
properly implemented and supervised:
a. the boundaries of the proposed FMD free zone,
b. the boundaries and measures of a protection zone, if applicable,
c. the system for preventing the entry of the virus (including the
control of the movement of susceptible animals) into the proposed FMD
free zone (in particular if the procedure described in Article
8.5.10. is implemented).

The proposed free zone will be included in the list of FMD free zones
where vaccination is practised only after the submitted evidence has
been accepted by the OIE. The information required in points 2, 3,
and 4 b-c above should be re-submitted annually and changes in the
epidemiological situation or other significant events including those
relevant to points 3 b and 4 should be reported to the OIE according
to the requirements in Chapter 1.1.

If a Member that has a zone which meets the requirements of a FMD
free zone where vaccination is practised wishes to change the status
of the zone to FMD free zone where vaccination is not practised, the
status of this zone remains unchanged for a period of at least 12
months after vaccination has ceased. Evidence should also be provided
showing that FMDV infection has not occurred in the said zone during
that period."

Information on the actual FMD situation in Turkish Thrace and
validation of its current status are to be expected. - Mod.AS]
