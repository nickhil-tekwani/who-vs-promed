Hepatitis E in Chad - WHO Update 4
---------------------------------
Between 26 Jun and 17 Sep 2004, a total of 1442 cases, and 46 deaths, (case
fatality rate 3.2 percent) of suspected hepatitis E cases have been
reported from refugee camps Goz Amer, Djabal, and from neighboring
villages. The overall weekly number of reported cases is decreasing in the
camps but not in the neighboring villages around Goz Amer camp.
The team from the Global Task Force on Cholera Control working in eastern
Chad (see report) will be following up with the implementation of the water
and sanitation recommendations, including the systematic chlorination of
all water points, increasing soap distribution, and social mobilization and
health education activities.
