The Ramón Carrillo Hospital informed this Wednesday [26 Oct 2022] that a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed in San Martín de los Andes [Neuquén]. The patient is a 28-year-old person from the cordillera locality who is hospitalized "with a reserved prognosis and with assisted mechanical ventilation," stated the health institution.

In the message, the hospital director, Ernesto Vignaroli, indicated that the epidemiological departments of the hospital and of the IV Sanitary Zone, "are working on the case to determine the possible place of exposure and infection in this rural area."

In addition, they are "investigating in order to identify the close contacts that could have been with the patient in order to do the corresponding isolation."

They point out that symptoms that require [medical] attention are fever, fatigue, muscle pain, cough, headache, and vomiting. And if the person carried out activities in risk areas, it is necessary to consult a health center or the hospital.

The San Martin Hospital offered a series of recommendations to the population in order to avoid hantavirus [infection] cases. They are:
- Avoid the entry of rodents into the home, sealing all the openings that they see ([rodents] can enter through openings that are the size of a 10-cent coin [about 2 cm]/0.75 in).
- Do not use poison to capture rodents.
- When carrying out cleaning and/or weeding activities that entail the risk of being in contact with rodents or their secretions, protection measures must be used: N95 masks, household gloves, and goggles. Clothes must be washed when cleaning activities are completed.
- When entering a closed place (houses, sheds, etc.) ventilate for 30 minutes and later spray with a bleach dilution, leave for 30 minutes, and clean with a mop (DO NOT sweep) utilizing the protective measures mentioned.
- Areas where rodents might have been, must be cleaned with a dilution of one part bleach (60 g/l) for 9 parts of water.
- Consume potable water (if not sure, treat with 2 drops of bleach per liter).
- Do not drink water from natural streams.
- Do not leave any food or leftovers uncovered.
- Make sure waste is adequately collected and disposed of.

[There is no indication of the specific rural environmental setting where this man might have acquired his infection. The health agency's investigation may determine that and is informing the public in that locality about preventive measures for avoiding infection.

Although the virus involved in the case above and the previous ones located in or adjacent to the Andes Mountains is not mentioned. The most likely virus involved is the Andes virus, found in western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.

There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Andes virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact. That is the reason for tracing individuals who have been in contact with the case above. - Mod.TY
