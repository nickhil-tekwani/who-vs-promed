[As this is the same farm affected in 2012 when 2/6 animals died, I think we can assume that any herd vaccination policy was relaxed, with the result seen here. While neighbouring farms might stop annual vaccination after 3 years, index herds should be vaccinated for a minimum of 5 years. There is clearly a hot-spot in this pasture, possibly where the 2 affected animals in 2012 were buried, but remembering that the source of the June 2012 outbreak was never found. If a contaminated hot-spot can be found, it would be wise to fence it off to prevent another repetition. Even so, as Sterne vaccine is very cheap, the herd must be vaccinated both now and for the next 5 years at a minimum.
