Rabies in haematophagous and non-haematophagous bats Brazil; protection
afforded by Fuenzalida-Pala

[Arthur King had written "but I would like to ... pass the question to Alex
Wandeler in Canada, who may not only be able to give a better answer but
whom I believe may be interested in looking at the genetics of some of the
non-haematophagous bat viruses." - Mod.MHJ
Not having any first-hand experience with either Fuenzalida-Palacios
vaccine or vampire rabies, my comments are strictly conjectural.
["I would suggest having antibody level measured as soon as possible and
then every six months and boost when the titre falls to 0.5IU." A.K.
This is precisely what we are doing in the rabies laboratories of the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. Personnel of the rabies laboratories must
be vaccinated against rabies. Antibody titers must be higher than 0.5 IU in
order to be permitted to work in the labs. Titers are checked every 6
months. A booster is given when antibody levels fall below 0.5 IU. One or
several booster injections are given if a serious exposure occurs,
depending on the seriousness of the exposure, not on the preexisting titer.
["The second point I would make is that I believe diploid cell vaccine to
be superior to all others BUT I do not know what the consequence of
following F-P vaccine with HDCV would be, perhaps Alex may be able to
answer." A.K.
Vampire bat rabies viruses are serotype 1 (genotype 1) lyssaviruses. They
are usual serotype 1 viruses: Differences between them and other rabies
virus variants in the Americas fall within the range of polymorphism within
serotype 1. All potent rabies vaccines should protect from infection with
vampire bat virus. Seroconversion in a vaccinated individual can in general
be taken as an indication of protection (exceptions are possible), though
this is not proven for the human species.
I am not in a position to tell if any of the modern tissue culture vaccines
would have a higher potency than a particular lot of Fuenzalida-Palacios
vaccine. However, I would have great hesitations to recommend repeated
boosting with this vaccine over long time periods.
A change from F-P vaccine to HDCV (or equivalent) does not cause problems.
