During a routine inspection in a dairy cattle farm in Ottersweier (Rastatt district), infection with the bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8) virus has been discovered. This has been followed by the setting up of a large restricted zone, covering the entire state of Baden-Wurttemberg, the entire Saarland and southern parts of Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse. As the Stuttgart Ministry of Agriculture announced on Wednesday [12 Dec 2018], the zone is 150 km [93 mi] around the place of the outbreak.

"The virus is not dangerous to humans. Meat, milk, and their products can therefore be consumed without hesitation," said Minister of Agriculture Peter Hauk (CDU).

Bluetongue can affect sheep, goats, and cattle. It is a viral disease and is transmitted by small blood-sucking arthropods.

The county council Rastatt officially detected bluetongue on Wednesday [12 Dec 2018]. The infection of the animals has been demonstrated during the routine annual examination. The company is now under official supervision.

[An official press release by the Ministry of Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection in Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been published on Thu 13 Dec 2018 (available, in German, at https://mlr.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/unser-service/presse-und-oeffentlichkeitsarbeit/pressemitteilung/pid/virus-fuer-menschen-nicht-gefaehrlich-landesweites-restriktionsgebiet-wird-eingerichtet-fleisch-un/). It includes the following additional information:

Contagion of the animals has been demonstrated within the routine annual screening program. The herd is now under official supervision. Further disease control measures are currently not necessary in the livestock.

The declaration of the entire state of Baden-Wurttemberg as a BTV-8-restricted area addresses cattle, sheep, goats, and captive wild ruminants. The status of a restricted area should be maintained for at least 2 years. Only then can the Federal Republic of Germany declare itself free from bluetongue disease (BT).

The movement of cattle, sheep, goats, and captive wild ruminants within Baden-Wurttemberg is possible without prior BTV vaccination or laboratory testing with the approval of the respective competent veterinary office, provided that the animals do not show disease symptoms during the movement indicating bluetongue disease.

On the other hand, the movement or export of ruminants and their sperm, ova, and embryos from Baden-Wurttemberg to an unregulated area is permitted only if the animals have effective vaccination protection, prescribed laboratory tests have been carried out, or the animals have been kept for at least 60 days in an insect-free holding. Usually this means that the animals can only be moved to a BTV-8-free area if they have effective vaccination protection. Calves born to cows with an effective vaccine protection and given colostral milk from their mothers within the 1st 6 hours of life can be moved to a BTV-8-free area within Germany. For this purpose, the so-called pet owner declaration should be completed, attesting that the said conditions have been fulfilled. For the slaughter of unvaccinated animals from Baden-Wurttemberg outside this state, the so-called channeling procedure must be applied.

Minister of Agriculture Peter Hauk emphasized that "Most importantly, as far as possible, all cattle, sheep, and goats in the country will be vaccinated in the coming years against BTV-8 and additionally against serotype 4 (BTV-4), which was detected in France. Only then can the epidemic be successfully eradicated, and animals from Baden-Wurttemberg can be returned to other regions without restrictions. I therefore urge once again all cattle, sheep, and goat farmers in the country to have their animals vaccinated against BTV-4 and BTV-8. Land and Tierseuchenkasse Baden-Wurttemberg support the vaccination with a grant."

The ministry's website includes the following background information:

Bluetongue in sheep can be an acute disease, while in cattle it is usually without or only with mild disease symptoms. Goats, New World camelids (including llamas and alpacas) and wild ruminants are also susceptible to BT. There are numerous serotypes of the virus. It is transmitted between susceptible animals by small, blood-sucking mosquitoes (biting midges) of the genus _Culicoides_. Humans, on the other hand, cannot be infected.

In August 2006, BTV-8 was 1st detected in Germany. The virus spread over a large part of Germany in 2007 and 2008. The entire federal territory was designated at that time as a BTV-8 restriction zone. From 17 Nov 2009, no outbreak was detected.

In 2008 and 2009, cattle, sheep, and goats were vaccinated in Germany as part of a mandatory vaccination with inactivated BTV-8 vaccines. Vaccination of captive wild ruminants was voluntary. On 1 Jan 2010, the obligation to vaccinate cattle, sheep, and goats was lifted. On a voluntary basis, it was initially continued in Baden-Wurttemberg in 2010 and 2011. The consistent vaccination strategy at that time led to the rapid eradication of bluetongue disease in Germany. Since 2016, Baden-Wurttemberg has again voluntarily vaccinated against BTV-4 and BTV-8 with financial support from the state and the Tierseuchenkasse Baden-Wurttemberg.

A bluetongue monitoring program established in 2007 has carried out extensive studies on cattle, sheep, and goats, and to a lesser extent on wild ruminants. Monitoring of susceptible animals continued after 2010 to control Germany's BT freedom and to respond quickly in the event of a recurrence of the disease. Since 2010, no BT virus has been detected in Germany during the monitoring investigations.
