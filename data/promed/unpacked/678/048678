Two months into the dry season in the African 'Meningitis Belt', 15
595 cases including 1670 deaths have been reported to the WHO from 4
countries: Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan,
& Uganda. Of these, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
are at the extreme south of the 'Meningitis Belt', which stretches
from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east, an area with an
estimated population of 300 million. The samples taken show that
these cases are caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A, the
most common serogroup in Africa.
In northern Uganda, 2961 cases including 105 deaths have been
reported in several areas. A vaccination campaign has been completed
in some areas and is continuing in others. WHO and Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF) are working together to contain the outbreak.
In southern Sudan, 6946 cases including 430 deaths have been reported
from 9 out of 10 states.
In Burkina Faso 4958 cases including 432 deaths were reported.
In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 730 cases and 84 deaths have
been reported.
The International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision for
Epidemic Meningitis has so far released 1.1 million doses of vaccine
to respond to the outbreak in southern Sudan and is ready to provide
additional doses if needed. Around 1.5 million people in affected
counties have been targeted in a mass vaccination campaign organized
by the National authorities, WHO, MSF, International Medical
Services, as well as other NGOs (non-governmental organizations)
present in the area, and supported by UNICEF (United Nations
Children's Fund), OCHA (United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs), and the European Community Humanitarian Office
(ECHO). The affected areas are known to host large numbers of
returnees, as well as displaced populations living in areas not
easily accessible and dispersed population settlements.
Vaccination campaigns are ongoing in Burkina Faso, where the ICG has
already released 530 000 doses. WHO is present in the field in all
the affected countries, assisting with the surveillance and control
measures. The WHO and partners have provided drugs for case
management as well as emergency supplies for outbreak investigation
and technical guidance for outbreak control and management.
In the African 'Meningitis Belt', enhanced epidemiological
surveillance and prompt case management with oily chloramphenicol --
the standardized antibiotic treatment -- are used to control
epidemics. At the same time, WHO and partners recommend reactive mass
vaccinations targeted at the highest risk groups, usually people
between the ages of 2-30 years. Every district that is in an epidemic
phase, as well as adjoining districts that are in the alert phase,
should be targeted for vaccination. It is estimated that a mass
immunization campaign, promptly implemented, can prevent 70 percent of cases.
This season, the ICG secured some 8 million doses as an emergency
stockpile. There are 5.5 million doses currently available. Despite
concerns about a shortage of vaccine, WHO estimates that some 15
million doses are still available on the market, which countries can
purchase. Furthermore, to rapidly address the potential shortage of
vaccine supply, WHO decided to assess the status and production
capacity of polysaccharide manufactures worldwide. One manufacturer,
Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil, was identified as the strongest and
quickest alternative for scaling-up vaccine supply in the short and
medium term. In partnership with the Finlay Institute in Cuba,
Bio-Manguinhos is working with WHO to ensure a supply of up to 10
million doses of bivalent AC meningitis vaccine by the next epidemic season.

Health officials reported that 22 districts in this West African
nation have been declared epidemic zones, following the death of more
than 400 people in a meningitis outbreak. The deaths are out of
nearly 5000 meningitis cases since January 2007 in Burkina Faso, a
country inside what the WHO calls Africa's 'Meningitis Belt', the agency said.
A statement released by the country's ministry of health said that
while 22 districts have been classified as epidemic zones, another 15
are on alert, and 4 are inside the densely populated capital.

From 1 Jan to 11 Mar 2007, the Ministry of Health of the Government
of Southern Sudan (MoH) reported 6946 suspected cases of
meningococcal disease including 430 deaths (case-fatality rate, 6.19
percent) in 9 out of 10 states of Southern Sudan. Due to delayed and
irregular reporting, these figures should be considered provisional.
Currently the most affected counties are Aweil West, Juba, Mundri
East, Rumbek, Tonj South, Wulu, and Yirol.
In a one week period from 4 to 11 Mar 2007, a total of 1541 suspected
cases including 81 deaths were reported.
MoH, WHO, and its partners have carried out a mass vaccination
campaign in 4 counties; Aweil town (MoH), Kajo-Keiji (Medecins sans
Frontieres (MSF) - Switzerland), Tonj-East (MSF- Switzerland), and
Yambio (International Medical Corp). Mass vaccination campaigns are
ongoing in Aweil West (MSF-France) and scheduled to start in Bor,
Juba, Nimule, and Rumbek in mid-March 2007.
A technical team from WHO Headquarters and the Regional Office is
currently in South Sudan to strengthen WHO's technical support to MoH
including surveillance, field investigation, mass vaccination, case
management, logistics, and coordination.
