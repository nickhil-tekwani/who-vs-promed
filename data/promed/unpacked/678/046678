7 cases of whooping cough have been reported in the Batavia school district so far in 2015. In Rochester, there has been a reported case of an elementary student with whooping cough. There have also been reported cases in Geneseo.

The Monroe county health department is asking parents be mindful that there was 1 case in a city. If your child develops a persisting cough and it's not getting better, they need to see a doctor.

Parents of children at the school on Webster Avenue in the city were sent a letter about the whooping cough cases. It reads in part, "We are writing to inform you that the county health department has confirmed a case of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, in a student at our school."

In Monroe County, we're told they're seeing more pertussis cases. County health representatives say there are between 50-100 cases a year now compared to 10 years ago, when there were only about 10-20 cases a year.

An outbreak of whooping cough has been reported in Ocean County, according to a media report. The Asbury Park Press is reporting that 3 cases of the respiratory disease were reported last week in Lakewood. Whooping cough, known formally as pertussis, is a highly contagious respiratory infection that causes violent coughing fits and a characteristic "whooping" sound, according to the CDC. The bacterial infection can be deadly in infants.

The Press report said the Ocean County Health Department says the cases are centered in Lakewood's Orthodox Jewish communities and appear related to an outbreak of whooping cough in Brooklyn.

The health department is reaching out to members of local Orthodox communities and adults throughout Ocean County and urging Tdap vaccination for everyone who has contact with small children, the Press report said

Western Albemarle High School has a confirmed case of whooping cough. Schools sent a note to parents Thursday, 12 Nov 2015, to inform them of the situation. Whooping cough, or pertussis, is spread through the air by coughing.

The note says casual contact in a classroom setting usually does not warrant routine preventative treatment. However, it does urge parents to take their children to a doctor if they cough for more than 2 weeks or it happens in fits and spasms.

There have been 52 confirmed cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, so far in 2015 in West Virginia, and health officials confirm 5 outbreaks of the disease. It's a disease that can be stopped [prevented] with a vaccine.

"When an outbreak occurs, we move quickly to quash that because if not, we can have an entire day care, school or community affected very quickly," Howard Gamble of the Wheeling-Ohio County Health Department said, "When you have an outbreak announced concerning public health, you become a little more vigilant. We put out notices to hospitals and doctors that says be on the lookout for Pertussis. We're seeing it our area or different parts of the state. Now is the time to be [cognizant] of what's going on."

Gamble says Ohio County is not 1 of the 5 counties, but 1 county in the Ohio Valley has been affected, so all 55 counties are on alert. The 5 counties have not been revealed by state administrators, but Gamble says it is a serious, but preventable, issue. Gamble added whooping cough was a big deal back in the 1920s, when more than 100 000 people contracted the disease and more than 500 died from it. He says as living conditions improved and access to health care was easier, the numbers dwindled.

[The morbidity and mortality of pertussis in older children and adults is quite small compared with that in infants under 12 months of age, especially those under 6 months of age. In the wake of the increase in cases in older children and adolescents attributed to unimmunized children and in those with waning immunity attributed to the acellular vaccine (as compared with the classic whole-cell killed vaccine), immunization programs have targeted the concept of cocooning the newborn infant by immunization of those around the infant and immunizing the pregnant woman in the 2nd or 3rd trimester.

A newly released study now links an increased risk, albeit small, for the development of epilepsy in individuals who had a hospital-diagnosed case of pertussis:

Olsen M, Thygesen SK, Ostergaard JR, et al: Hospital-Diagnosed Pertussis Infection in Children and Long-term Risk of Epilepsy.
JAMA. 2015 Nov 3;314(17):1844-9. doi: 10.1001/jama.2015.13971.

IMPORTANCE:
Pertussis is associated with encephalopathy and seizures in infants. However, the risk of childhood epilepsy following pertussis is unknown.

OBJECTIVE:
To examine whether pertussis is associated with the long-term risk of epilepsy.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
We used individually linked data from population-based medical registries covering all Danish hospitals to identify a cohort of all patients with pertussis born between 1978 and 2011, followed up through 2011. We used the Civil Registration System to identify 10 individuals from the general population for each patient with pertussis, matched on sex and year of birth.

EXPOSURES:
Inpatient or hospital-based outpatient diagnosis of pertussis.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
Cumulative incidence and hazard ratio of time to hospital-based epilepsy diagnosis (pertussis cohort vs general population cohort), adjusted for birth year, sex, maternal history of epilepsy, presence of congenital malformations, and gestational age. Unique personal identifiers permitted unambiguous data linkage and complete follow-up for death, emigration, and hospital contacts.

RESULTS:
We identified 4700 patients with pertussis (48 percent male), of whom 90 developed epilepsy during the follow-up. The cumulative incidence of epilepsy at age 10 years was 1.7 percent (95 percent CI, 1.4-2.1) for patients with pertussis and 0.9 (95 percent CI, 0.8-1.0) for the matched comparison cohort. The corresponding adjusted overall hazard ratio was 1.7 (95 percent CI, 1.3-2.1).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
In Denmark, risk of epilepsy was increased in children with hospital-diagnosed pertussis infections compared with the general population; however, the absolute risk was low. - Mod.LL
