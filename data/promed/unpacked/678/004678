Parasite may be cause of 'roo deaths
------------------------------------
Investigations into an ailment affecting large numbers of wild animals in
the Pindima area have taken another turn, with pathology tests finding an
unidentified parasite in the blood, in the brain of a deceased Eastern Grey
kangaroo. Around 38 sick native animals from the Pindima area have been
taken to Great Lakes Wildlife Rescue for care over the past couple of
months. Many have died, exhibiting symptoms of anaemia, wasting, and with
blood that won't clot.
Ron Seal, of Great Lakes Wildlife Rescue, has strongly suspected a commonly
available rabbit poison may have been the reason for the deaths. However 2
lots of laboratory tests have not found residual traces of the poison in
blood or in liver tissue. Mr Seal said the rabbit poison is still quite
likely killing off smaller native animal species like bandicoots and
possums. But now more tests have been requested so the possibility of a
blood parasite can be further investigated. Mr Seal said he hopes to
collect at least 2 more ailing kangaroos from the Pindima area and will
have blood tests taken on some of the surviving joeys in care. He believes
there may be a link to a paper written on a similar affliction, among
Eastern Grey kangaroos in care, about 6 years ago.
Scientists believe the parasite could be spread through contact with
insects like mosquitoes, flies, and ticks. "This may be the first recorded
incidence of such a parasite affecting a wild population of Eastern Grey
kangaroos, but we don't know" he [Mr Seal?] said. He said residents at
Pindima are keenly observing the local kangaroo population and that may be
why the number of sick animals has been reported. An illness raging through
a larger or less "urban" population of kangaroos could well go unnoticed,
he said.
The only paper from 6 years ago mentioning parasite infection in Eastern
Grey kangaroos was attributed to _Trypanosoma_ sp.

[The following article citation was provided by A-Lan Banks. Noyes HA,
Stevens JR, Teixeira M, Phelan J, Holz P. A nested PCR for the ssrRNA gene
detects _Trypanosoma binneyi_ in the platypus and _Trypanosoma_ sp. in
wombats and kangaroos in Australia. Int J Parasitol. 1999; 29(2): 331-9.
Erratum in: Int J Parasitol 2000; 30(2): 228.
"Trypanosome infections in their natural hosts are frequently difficult to
detect by microscopy, and culture methods are unreliable and not suitable
for all species of _Trypanosoma_. A nested PCR strategy for detecting and
identifying _Trypanosoma_ species, suitable for detecting both known and
unknown trypanosomes, is presented. 32 blood samples from 23 species of
Australian birds and mammals were screened by a nested PCR for the presence
of _Trypanosoma_ sp. ssrRNA. 3 infections were detected, one in an Eastern
Grey kangaroo (_Macropus giganteus_), one in a common wombat (_Vombatus
ursinus_), and one in a platypus (_Ornithorhynchus anatinus_).
"The kangaroo and wombat are new host records for _Trypanosoma_ sp.; the
platypus parasite was _Trypanosoma hinneyi_. The 3 parasites could be
distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the amplified
fragment of the ssrRNA gene. The kangaroo and wombat parasites were also
isolated in a semi-solid blood agar medium. The cultured forms of the
kangaroo trypanosome had an expanded flagellar sheath in which structures
similar to hemidesmosomes were detected by EM. The nested PCR was at least
as sensitive as culture, and analysis of the PCR products gave
parasite-specific fingerprints. Therefore this method could be suitable for
rapidly screening host animals for the presence of trypanosomes and
identifying the infecting strain."
Further evidence of the cause of morbidity among the kangaroos would be
welcomed. - Mod.TG]
