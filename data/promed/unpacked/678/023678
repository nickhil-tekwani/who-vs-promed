Rubella cases probably from Netherlands
---------------------------------------
The rubella outbreak galloping through a cluster of religious communities
in south western Ontario probably originated in a outbreak in the
Netherlands, Ontario's chief medical officer of health said on Monday [9
May 2005].
Dr Sheela Basrur confirmed that a 3rd pregnant woman has tested positive
for the disease, which can trigger a miscarriage or cause birth defects in
the fetus when contracted in the early stages of pregnancy. "We are
speculating that it was introduced from the Netherlands, given the
cross-border traffic that exists between this community and a similar
community in the Netherlands," Basrur said. "They've had an outbreak going
on for 8 months now in what they call the Bible Belt." Ontario's health
minister predicted the outbreak could drag on for some weeks yet.
"We're really still in the phase of the outbreak where our investigations
will lead to more people (with the virus)," George Smitherman said. "We're
not at a point yet where we can declare the outbreak under control." Basrur
said to date there is no evidence that the virus has moved into other
nearby religious groups that also shun vaccination. But health officials
are investigating whether there are any links between the communities and
whether additional measures are needed to reduce the chance of it spreading.
Meanwhile, Basrur said she'll be pressing members of all the religious
groups to have their children vaccinated if they are currently unprotected.
"We have not yet seen spread to the Amish or Mennonite communities. (But)
they do live in adjacent geographic areas. And so for that reason, those
health units in which they live will be redoubling their efforts to
encourage them to seek vaccination," she said.
As of Monday the case count in the outbreak was 121, including the 3
pregnant women. 7 other pregnant women who may have been exposed to the
highly contagious virus are under observation.
Rubella poses its greatest risk to fetuses in the first 11 weeks of
gestation. Children born with congenital rubella syndrome can suffer
cognitive disabilities or may be deaf or blind. Citing confidentiality
rules, Basrur wouldn't say at what point in their pregnancy these women are.
Curiously, the case count also includes a 32 year old man who was
vaccinated against rubella in 1974. The man attends Westervelt community
college in nearby London, Ontario. Public health authorities urged any
pregnant women at the college to contact their physicians immediately.
Basrur said it's suspected that this case of vaccine failure was probably
caused by a break in what's called the cold chain -- the requirement to
ensure vaccines are stored at temperatures no higher than 8 degrees Celsius
until they are administered.
It is believed the man became infected after coming in contact with fellow
students who are older siblings of children attending the religious school
that has been at the heart of the outbreak -- Rehoboth Christian School in
Norwich, about 40 kilometres east of London. The school draws its students
from 4 closely aligned religious denominations: the Heritage Netherlands
Reformed Congregation, the Old Reformed Congregation, the Netherlands
Reformed Congregation of North America, and the Netherlands Reformed
Congregation. The bulk of the school's 651 students come from this last
church, which is officially neutral on the issue of vaccination. But many
of its members choose not to immunize their children, and about 60 per cent
of the students attending Rehoboth Christian School are unvaccinated.
Public health authorities have issued an indefinite school exclusion order
for unvaccinated children who have never had rubella, which is also known
as German measles. Rubella is a viral illness spread through coughing or
sneezing. Its symptoms include rash, fever, swollen glands, joint pain,
muscle pain and runny nose. Public health officials hope to eliminate the
virus in the Americas by 2010 but have recognized that while the virus
circulates elsewhere, eradication here is unlikely.

Ontario reports large rubella outbreak, warns could be tip of iceberg
-----------------------
Public health officials in Ontario reported a large outbreak of rubella,
sometimes known as German measles, on Friday [29 Apr 2005] and warned the
50 cases that have currently been confirmed could be the tip of the iceberg.
Dr Sheela Basrur, the province's chief medical officer of health,
confirmed the cluster centres on a school in the Woodstock region in Oxford
County, but has spilled into the neighbouring counties of Brant and
Norfolk. The known cases are mainly young children at this point, she said
in an interview from Kingston.
"The cases appear to be linked to the Dutch Reform Church which tends to
avoid immunization for religious reasons," Basrur said. "Therefore we have
a highly susceptible population that are unimmunized against common
childhood diseases, including German measles."

[Rubella is a vaccine-preventable disease, still endemic in many countries
(see below -- a total of 10 prior postings on rubella in over 10 years of
ProMED-mail's existence). However, this outbreak has too many "deja vu"
components to allow this moderator to follow our policy of not posting
"routine" outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases -- and definitely
serves as a reminder that we live in a global village.
In 1978/1979, the last outbreak of polio in Canada and the USA was related
to travel between the Netherlands (where the outbreak was ongoing in 1978)
and Canada by members of the Reformed Netherlands Congregation, a religious
group that refused vaccinations based on religious beliefs. The following
quote is from a MMWR article originally published on 27 Jul 1979 and
contributed to by this moderator at that time: "Epidemiologic information
also links last year's [1978] poliomyelitis epidemic in the Netherlands and
Canada with this year's outbreak in the United States and Canada. During
the 1978 outbreak, members of the affected religious group traveled from
the Netherlands to Canada, where cases subsequently appeared. An Amish
family from an Ontario town [near Woodstock] 15 miles from the affected
area moved in late summer 1978 to the Pennsylvania town where the 1st U.S.
Amish case subsequently occurred, in January 1979. There were also other,
less well-defined contacts between Amish persons in Ontario and
Pennsylvania." <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00050435.htm>
Genetic markers performed on the viruses involved in all 3 countries were
similar to those of a poliovirus circulating in Kuwait in 1977.
This current outbreak of rubella seems to be following a similar geographic
journey, thus far restricted to the same religious subgroup that places
constraints on vaccination of its children. Further similarities include
the recent declaration of interruption of rubella transmission in the USA
(see Achievements in public health: elimination of rubella and congenital
rubella syndrome -- United States, 1969--2004. 2005; 54(early release):1-4,
21 Mar <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm54e321a1.htm>). One
wonders if the virus will follow the same itinerary -- to other neighboring
groups that do not vaccinate based on religious beliefs and then south into
the USA.
Returning to rubella, for the individual infected, it is usually a mild
self-limited febrile rash illness with minimal sequelae. It has been
associated with a self-limited poly-arthritis/arthropathy, especially in
adult women (up to 70 per cent of adult women may manifest this).
Encephalitis has been reported at a rate of 1 in 6000 infections, again
more frequent in adult women. Hemorrhagic manifestations have been reported
at a rate of 1 in 3000 infections, felt to be due to low platelets and
vascular damage, more common in children than adults, and most cases
recover. The more serious consequences of infection with this virus occur
when a pregnant woman is infected, producing a complex of multiple
congenital anomalies in the child, referred to as congenital rubella
syndrome. When infection occurs in early gestation, it may lead to fetal
death, spontaneous abortion, or premature delivery. While fetal infection
may occur throughout pregnancy, defects are rare when infection occurs
after the 20th week of gestation.
In the pre-vaccine era, serosurveys conducted in the USA revealed that by
age 18, about 85 per cent of the population had evidence of prior rubella
infection, leaving about 15 per cent of the population over age 18 (and
thereby in the childbearing age group) susceptible.
Rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 by Parkman and Weller. Rubella
virus is classified as a togavirus, genus Rubivirus, and is most closely
related to group A arboviruses, such as Eastern and Western Equine
Encephalitis viruses. It is an enveloped RNA virus, with a single antigenic
type that does not cross-react with other members of the togavirus group.
