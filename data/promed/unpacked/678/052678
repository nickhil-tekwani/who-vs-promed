A total of 16 people, including 4 women, have been infected with
anthrax at Khirshin Tikar village under Paba sub-district of
northwestern Rajshahi district after eating contaminated beef.

Having heard the news of infection on Saturday night [20 Aug 2011],
sub-district executive officer Abu Selim Mahmudul Hassan and
sub-district livestock officer Shafiqul Alam visited the area and set
up a health camp from yesterday [21 Aug 2011]. Quoting the report,
they said the infected people had eaten beef of 2 slaughtered cattle
purchased from a market near the Rajshahi city on 3 Aug 2011.
Subsequently, all the men and women, who were involved in
slaughtering, slicing, and handling the meat, were infected with the
skin disease.

About 10 of them were given treatment at Rajshahi Medical College
Hospital (RMCH) in the past one week. "We are getting anthrax patients
in the hospital frequently for the last couple of days," said Dr
Nazmul Huda Sumon, Resident Physician of RMCH, adding that they are
now improving after treatment.

Talking to newsmen, Dr Mahbubur Rahman, assistant professor of
Medicine of RMCH, put emphasis on creating awareness about the
precautionary measures. Meanwhile, District Livestock Officer Azizul
Haque held a co-ordination meeting with officials at the office of
Deputy Commissioner Abdul Hannan yesterday and discussed handling of
the situation.

It appears that human and livestock anthrax is continuing virtually
unabated as in previous years. A parallel report on bdnews24
(http://www.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=203983&cid=13) has the
village livestock being vaccinated. The ages of 13 of the16 people
affected are: 24, 25 (x2), 30 (x2), 35 (x3), 40 (x3), 55, and 60, the
ages of people one would expect to be involved in slaughtering and
butchering animals.
