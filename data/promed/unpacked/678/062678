Rat bite fever has been confirmed in a few Chelan and Douglas County residents and possibly in a Grant County resident who may have been exposed here. The Chelan-Douglas Health District issued a press release about the illness Fri 7 Dec 2012, but offices are closed on Fridays so details on how many cases were not available.

Rat bite fever is a bacterial disease carried by rats and is part of the normal flora of their mouths and noses, according to the press release. Other animals such as mice, gerbils, ferrets, squirrels, cats, especially feral cats and dogs can get infected, and may or may not get sick with rat bite fever, but they may also spread it.

There is no known person-to-person transmission, and it is more commonly seen in children. A bite, scratch, droppings or urine from an infected rodent can transmit the disease. Any food items potentially contaminated by rodents or their droppings should be thrown away. Contaminated water sources and unpasteurized milk have also been considered possible health risks for rat bite fever.

Illness develops within 3 weeks of the exposure. Initial symptoms include fever, muscle aches, joint pain, headache, nausea, and vomiting and many people develop a rash on their hands and feet one to 5 days after having a fever. Unlike influenza, there is no cough associated with the illness and it is easily treated with antibiotics.

[No further information regarding these cases has been released.

Bacillary rat bite fever due to _S. moniliformis_ is not commonly diagnosed in the USA, and these cases are particularly noteworthy due to the possibility rapid fulmination in an adult. Since this infection is not commonly diagnosed, it is likely that the cases are epidemiologically related through a common reservoir or vehicle.

Infection may also occur following ingestion of contaminated food or drink and may cause clusters of cases. One such outbreak was reported in 1926 from Haverhill, Massachusetts, and was apparently linked to contaminated milk (Parker F Jr., Hudson NP: The etiology of Haverhill fever (erythema arthriticum epidemicum) Am J Pathol 1926;2:357-79).

The spirochete _Spirillium minus_ can also cause rat bite fever, the spirillary form. _S. minus_ is associated with a significant proportion of cases in Asia but is rare in the USA. In Japan, the disease is referred to as sodoku (so = rat; doku = poison). - Mod.LL
