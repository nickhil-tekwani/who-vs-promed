In the posting regarding _Cryptosporidium_ infections in South
Australia the editor indicates that it is not usual for
_Cryptosporidia_ to be spread from person-to-person. Our experience
in Australia, is that cryptosporidiosis is commonly spread from one
infected person to another as shown by case control studies and the
commonness of secondary spread in households (Robertson et al, 2002).
It is often assumed that _Cryptosporidium_ is predominantly a
waterborne parasitic infection because of well-publicised waterborne
disease outbreaks. Waterborne cryptosporidiosis is clearly important
where water supplies have become contaminated by animal waste (Smith
et al, 2006). However, the vast majority of cases of
cryptosporidiosis reported to health departments are sporadic with no
known source.
In Australia, outbreaks of waterborne disease of any aetiology are
rare. In 1998, Sydney residents were advised to boil water due to
concerns about contamination of the water supply with
_Cryptosporidium_, although numbers of oocysts in water were
subsequently thought to be overestimated and there were no associated
human infections.
Every 4-6 years, State and Territory health departments report major
community-wide outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis with some clustering of
cases occurring around swimming pools and petting zoos (Puech et al,
2001; Ashbolt et al, 2003). These community-wide increases are not
related to water supplies, as they cross multiple water supply
systems and a source cannot be identified for the majority of cases.
In reality, the 2 main modes of transmission operating for
_Cryptosporidium sp._ are from infected animals and infected people
to susceptible individuals. These 2 modes of transmission probably
reflect the 2 main species infecting humans: _C. hominis_ and _C.
parvum_ (Hunter et al, 2007).

We have a severe drought in South Australia at the moment, and
believe that more parents than usual will be bathing their children
in the same bathwater in order to conserve water.
I am surprised that you doubt that _Cryptosporidium_ is transmitted
by sources other than 'water such as a swimming pool'. In our
investigations we had quite a lot of cases where many family members
were sick, and where there had been no history of contact with
swimming or wading pools or other recreational water sources.
Some children had shared baths, and we believe this was implicated.
As _Cryptosporidium_ oocysts are infectious immediately they are
passed and people have watery diarrhoea, it would be highly unlikely
that person-to-person contact transmission does NOT occur -- as it
does with bacterial diarrhoeal illnesses.
I suggest you refer to the following case reports where
person-to-person transmission has been implicated:
1. Wolfson JS et al: Cryptosporidiosis in immunocompetent hosts. N
Engl J Med 1985;312:1278-82.
2. Alpert G et al: Outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in a day-care
center. Pediatrics 1986;77:152-157.
3. Heijbel H et al: Outbreak of diarrhea in a day care center with
spread to household members: the role of _Cryptosporidium_. Pediatr
Infect Dis J 1987;6:532-535.
4. Cordell RL et al: Cryptosporidiosis in child care settings: a
review of the literature and recommendations for prevention and
control. Pediatr Infect Dis J 1994;13:310-317.
5. Koch KL et al. Cryptosporidiosis in hospital personnel. Evidence
for person-to-person transmission. Ann Intern Med 1985;102:593-596.
There are quite a few additional reports of nosocomial outbreaks.

[ProMED-mail thanks Martyn Kirk and Ann Koehler for their comments.
We agree that it is well documented that _Cryptosporidia_ can be
transmitted from person to person and we hereby pass the information
and the references to the different studies. - Mod.EP]
