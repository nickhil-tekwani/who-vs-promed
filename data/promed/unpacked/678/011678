Tar spot disease of maize
-------------------------
A couple of years ago, when visiting farmers in the Zapotitan region [La Libertad department] I observed, for the 1st time in the country, tar spot damage on maize leaves.

The stubble in the field after harvesting is a certain source of inoculum. This is important to consider in Zapotitan, where once the maize is harvested, a new planting is started. The conditions are favourable to the development of the disease: temperatures between 17-22 deg Celsius [62.6-71.6 deg F], 75 percent relative humidity, dew 7 hours at night, high levels of nitrogen in the soil, lack of proper crop rotation, and susceptible seeds.

There are appropriate fungicides to combat this threat, but because maize is grown by small farmers (320 000 manzanas [a unit of land area in many Central and South American countries; 544 000 acres/220 000 ha] in the country) with low profitability, it is essential not to increase production costs.

I do not believe that the disease is spread throughout the country, but we should not wait to take action until it appears. Farmers should be informed to use quality seed tolerant or resistant to tar spot.

[Tar spot of maize is a disease complex, which has been known to cause serious yield losses of up to 75 percent in Central and South America. It is caused by the association of at least 3 fungal species: _Phyllachora maydis_, _Monographella maydis_, and _Coniothyrium phyllachorae_.

Of these, _P. maydis_ is usually the first to cause leaf lesions. While _M. maydis_ is a common benign saprophyte on leaf surfaces, it becomes highly virulent only in association with _P. maydis_ and forms necrotic rings around the _P. maydis_ lesions. _C. phyllachorae_ may be a hyperparasite of the other 2, but its role is not fully understood yet. Leaf lesions may coalesce causing blight and complete burning of the foliage. In addition, characteristic black, shiny spots ("tar spots") are produced both within lesions and on other leaf areas. Affected ears have fewer kernels which may germinate prematurely on the cob.

_P. maydis_ is an obligate parasite, its spores are spread by wind, and it produces a potent toxin killing plant tissue. The disease is favoured by cool, humid conditions. Disease management relies mainly on the use of resistant maize varieties, however little is known about the genetics of tar spot resistance.

Tar spot outbreaks have also been reported in both of El Salvador's neighbours, Guatemala (ProMED-mail post 20090220.0710) and Honduras (ProMED-mail post 20110210.0456). It is surprising that in El Salvador apparently 2 years have passed since discovering the disease without any remedial action having been taken.
