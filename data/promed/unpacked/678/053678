Swift thinking of one Ontario pig farmer has resulted in early detection of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus.

In mid-June [2013], a producer noticed vomiting and diarrhea in its nursing pigs. The farmer contacted the herd veterinarian, who took samples and sent them to the University of Guelph's Animal Health Laboratory where TGE was diagnosed.

"TGE is a viral disease that has been present in the province for many years and causes vomiting, diarrhea, and high death loss in pigs," read a notice to producers released by Ontario's pork industry.

Signs of TGE are said to be identical to porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), a new disease which has spread to about 200 hog farms -- spanning 13 states in the United States. Since the PED outbreak in the US, there have been no cases diagnosed in Canada.

The producer was praised by the industry for prompt response and handling of the situation. "The recent handling of an outbreak of TGE is an excellent example of how to respond to unusual clinical signs in a swineherd," the statement read.

Ontario's swine industry warns that the risk of PED (porcine epidemic diarrhea) entering into Canada is greater with the disease rapidly spreading across the border. Producers are urged to be vigilant when implementing on-farm biosecurity measures.

The TGE health update was jointly released by Ontario Pork, Ontario Pork Industry Council, Canadian Swine Health Board, Swine Health Leadership, and Ontario Association of Swine Veterinarians.

[Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a common viral disease of the small intestine that causes vomiting and profuse diarrhea in pigs of all ages.

The causal coronavirus infects and destroys villous epithelial cells of the jejunum and ileum, which results in severe villous atrophy, malabsorption, osmotic diarrhea, and dehydration. The incubation period is about 18 hours. The infection spreads rapidly by aerosol or contact exposure. Severe epidemics are more common during winter due to survival of the virus in colder temperatures.

In non-immune herds, vomiting is often the initial sign, followed by profuse watery diarrhea, dehydration, and excessive thirst. Feces of nursing pigs often contain curds of undigested milk. Mortality is nearly 100 percent in piglets less than 1 week old, whereas pigs older than 1 month old seldom die. Gestating sows occasionally abort, and lactating sows often exhibit vomiting, diarrhea, and agalactia. Diarrhea in surviving nursing piglets continues for about 5 days, but older pigs may be diarrheic for a shorter period.

In large herds with endemic TGE, clinical signs are variable, depending on the level of immunity and magnitude of exposure. Immunity from antibody in the sow's milk usually is sufficient to protect pigs until they are 4-5 days old. As the antibody level in milk decreases, infection and mild disease may occur. Depending on the level of immunity and exposure, diarrhea may be mild in some litters but severe in others. If passive protection is sufficient to protect pigs throughout the nursing period, diarrhea often develops during the 1st few days after weaning.

There is no specific treatment. Increasing farrowing room temperature to minimize body heat loss and providing electrolyte solutions to combat dehydration are helpful. Administration of swine immunoglobulins has been reported to be beneficial. Weaning older nursing pigs that are consuming creep feed may reduce mortality.

Protective immunity depends on presence of antibody in the small intestine. Passive protection of piglets is provided by continual nursing of immune sows. Active, protective immunity develops after infection of the intestinal mucosa with virulent TGE virus. Active infection of the intestine with virulent virus provides protective immunity for 6-18 months due to a secretory IgA response. Vaccination of naturally immune sows boosts immunity sufficiently to protect neonates and is particularly useful in endemically infected herds. Vaccination of swine in herds free of TGE may not be economically beneficial because vaccines do not induce complete immunity.

Because TGE virus is easily spread during an epidemic by persons, animals, and fomites, special care should be taken to prevent spread to unexposed groups of pigs and to neighboring herds.

The producer's quick actions in the report above have likely shut down an outbreak before it could get a good foot hold. All diseases, especially those that spread so rapidly should be approached with such a sharp eye.
