The Wyoming Game and Fish Department confirmed a bull elk has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Elk Hunt Area 9. The elk was found dead near Corner Mountain Trail above the town of Centennial in Albany County. CWD has previously been documented in the surrounding elk hunt areas.

To ensure hunters are informed, Game and Fish announces when CWD is found in a new hunt area. Additionally, Game and Fish follows the human health recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control [CDC], which state that hunters should strongly consider having their elk, deer and moose tested if harvested in an area where CWD is known to occur, and not consume any animal that is obviously ill or tests positive for CWD.

A map of CWD endemic areas https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Wildlife-in-Wyoming/More-Wildlife/Wildlife-Disease/CWD-in-Wyoming-Wildlife/CWD-Map is available on the Game and Fish website.

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department is concerned about CWD and how it may affect the future of Wyoming's deer. The disease is fatal to deer, elk and moose. Recent research in Wyoming and Colorado shows it poses a serious threat to deer populations in areas with a high prevalence of the disease.

Last year [2017], Game and Fish personnel tested 3351 CWD samples throughout the state, a significant increase from past years and continues to evaluate new recommendations for trying to manage the disease. [Please note: they tested 3351 samples, which testing this high a number was an increase for testing. It does not tell us if there was a corresponding increase in positive samples found. - Mod.TG]

[It is understandably concerning a positive testing animal has been found in an area previously not known to have this disease. While this article seems to paint a very grim picture, it does not seem to have stopped hunters. The last paragraph indicated last year [2017] there was an increase in samples being tested. Either this is plenty of hunters or a very large increase in road kill.

So, while concerning, it is likely not the end of elk hunting for the state of Wyoming. - Mod.TG
