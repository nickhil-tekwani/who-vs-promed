Alarm at potato blight
----------------------
Domestic and commercial growers of English potatoes in the Highlands
face the threat of their crops being ravaged by a new fungal disease.
The disease, potato late blight, is caused by the fungus
_Phytophthora infestans_, and its identity was confirmed by National
Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) staff on samples they had
collected.
Late blight was first identified in the Sirunki area of Enga Province
about 3 weeks ago. Dr Sergi Bang, research leader of NARI's high
altitude station in Mt Hagen, said soon after the first report from
Kandep that symptoms of late blight were detected in Wapenamanda and
also in adjoining Western Highlands Province at Kwip, Banz, and Tomba.
On 24 Feb 2003, NARI sent up a team to these places to ascertain the
extent and spread of the disease. "This is so that we can look at how
to contain the disease," Dr. Bang said. The Post-Courier could not
confirm whether this disease has occurred in the provinces of Chimbu,
Southern and Eastern Highlands.
Dr. Bang said the disease attacked the leaves and the stem before
affecting the tubers. The disease is hard to contain through
quarantine roadblocks and checks, as fungal spores can be spread by
wind.
Fears of the disease spreading were first raised by the Post-Courier
after a visit to Kandep last week. Potato crops from Sirunki,
Laiagam, and Kandep were already affected. At Pokeramanda village
near Kandep station, the Highlands Post reporters saw vines of
affected potato crops being laid at the roadside. A farmer, So Wan
Kusit, said she had seen her crops die mysteriously. Asked if she was
aware of late blight and how she could prevent its spread, she shook
her head, looking bewildered.
There are thousands more like Mrs Kusit in the Kandep basin, Laiagam,
and Sirunki. The people are predominantly potato farmers, and potato
is the main staple diet. Amos Kai, the District Rural Development
Officer for Kandep explained the cause of her distress and advised
that farmers uproot all affected crops and bury them.
Dr Bang advised affected farmers not to cultivate English potatoes
for a couple of years to allow the fungus to die. He said that
commercial farmers could use recommended chemicals to control the
disease and suggested that they should be used alternatingly every
week so that the fungus does not build resistance to them.
In Kandep, the victims of a unusual frost who are still recovering
will be the hardest hit, because many of them have just started
planting English potatoes.

[There were actually 3 different news reports (21, 26 and 28 Feb,
2003) published by the Post-Courier newspaper related to this disease
outbreak. Rather than provide 3 reports, I have used the 26 Feb
report as the main source and incorporated some information from the
other reports to provide a single piece.
According to Martin Gunther, National Research Institute Highlands
High Altitude Research Center, the disease first broke out at
Sirunki, Enga Province and has spread to all parts of the province
including Laiagam, Kanadep, and Wapenamanda, and at Kwip, Banz, and
Tomba in adjoining Western Highlands Province. The fungus can survive
as mycelium in living potatoes, cull piles, or as volunteers that
overwinter. Plant pathologists in PNG are faced with finding
cultivars that are resistant to the prevailing races of the pathogen,
and that will depend upon selection of available sources of
resistance.
Potato late blight is a major pathogen of potato and is considered as
one of the most devastating diseases in human history. Its main hosts
are potato and tomato in the _Solanaceae_. Disease management depends
on use of several strategies (disease-free tubers for planting,
application of selected fungicides, destruction of potato vines by
chemicals or herbicides prior to harvesting to reduce tuber
infection, and breeding for resistance). The last strategy employs
use of cultivars that have polygenic or field resistance to the
pathogen. In such cultivars, combinations of several minor genes act
together to slow the rate of fungal development and enable the plants
to tolerate infection.
