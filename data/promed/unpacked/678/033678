A total 48 cases of cholera, 12 of them children, have been reported in 2 health centers in Camaguey city, according to Mr Santos Fernandez, an independent journalist, who presented this news in "Cuba al Dia", a program in Radio Marti.

The 12 children affected have been admitted to the Eduardo Agramonte pediatric hospital, while the affected adults are being taken care of in the provincial hospital Amalia Simoni, said the journalist who explained that one of his sources confirmed the homes of 3 patients: 2 from La Guernica community and the other from Saratoga, a community belonging to La Arenera locality. 36 additional cases are hospitalized in an observation room in Amalia Simoni Hospital, which is to be used for cholera patients, but their diagnosis has not been confirmed.

Meanwhile, Camaguey authorities gave a 72-hour deadline for every pig in the area to be sacrificed, and if their owners do not comply with this order, they will be fined 1000 to 1500 Cuban Pesos [approx USD 38-57] and the animals will be confiscated. This measure has not been well received by the citizenship -- pointed out Mr Fernandez -- since Holidays are approaching and pork is the traditional dish for these celebrations, and it is also the least expensive product in local markets.

Another measure for stopping the spread of this outbreak is the prohibition for sale of refreshments and ice cream. This has also been criticized by owners of small businesses.
