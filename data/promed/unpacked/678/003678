Salmonellosis has affected 13 people in France with a link to consuming a brand of raw milk cheese. They have been infected with the same strain of _Salmonella_ Dublin, according to the National Reference Center for _Salmonella_ at the Institut Pasteur.

Sante Publique France and the General Directorate of Food (DGAL) have identified a link between eating raw milk Morbier cheese made by the company Jean Perrin, based in the Cléron commune of Doubs in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region and those sick. Investigations with the producer are underway to identify the cause of contamination and take corrective actions.

SA Perrin has withdrawn from sale and recalled several lots and dates of Morbier cheese. Products are sold in the traditional and self-service departments of supermarkets throughout France and can be identified by the approval number FR 25-155-001 CE on the cheese or packaging. Authorities advise people that have the potentially affected products not to consume them and to take them back to the place of purchase.

A total of 8 men and 5 women with a median age of 72 have fallen ill from late November 2019 up to early January 2020. Cases are spread across 7 regions of France and 9 people needed hospital treatment; 3 people have died but it is not clear what role salmonellosis played in the deaths, according to Sante Publique France.

Most cases reported having eaten raw milk Morbier cheese bought in different stores before their symptoms began. Analysis by DGAL of cheese purchases from loyalty cards of the cases made it possible to identify that the Morbier came from the same supplier.

Symptoms of salmonellosis can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Healthy adults are usually sick for 4 to 7 days. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions.

[_Salmonella_ Dublin as a cause of salmonellosis associated with unpasteurized milk products brings back memories of my Infectious Diseases fellowship at Stanford in California related to the Alta Dena dairy. The following is part of an article published in 1997 by William Jarvis entitled "Raw milk can be deadly" (https://www.ncahf.org/articles/o-r/rawmilk.html) which described the episode (the references can be seen at the original URL):

"For many years, the state's [California] largest dairy (approximately USD 100 million per year), Alta Dena Dairy, aggressively promoted Certified Raw Milk (CRM) as a health food. The owner, Harold Stueve, was apparently a vitalist (one who believed that unprocessed foods possessed a mystical "life force"). A Los Angeles Times report revealed his ideology:

"Stueve ... was feeding milk samples to 2 young pumpkin plants. One plant was being fed raw milk; the other pasteurized. Stueve was convinced that the experiment would show that the raw milk would produce bigger, fatter pumpkins. "The Lord gives us everything in its wholeness, and that's the way He meant us to keep it," he said [3].

"The term "certified" raw milk has no public health significance -- it is a marketing term owned by the American Associations of Medical Milk Commissions (AAMMC). AAMMC was organized in 1907 to develop uniform standard for the production of "certified raw milk." One feature at the time was the elimination of bovine tuberculosis from cow herds. However, by 1941, all the disease had been eliminated from all US herds. Hygienic standards are similar in all modern dairy operations. Unfortunately, cleanliness does not protect consumers from every disease that may be transmitted via unpasteurized milk, and animal testing cannot prevent dangerous _Salmonella_ Dublin from contaminating milk. During the 1980s, Alta Dena was the lone member of the AAMMC, meaning that it "regulated" itself. The raw milk production facilities were sold by the Stueve family in the late 1980s, so that all milk sold under the Alta Dena label is pasteurized, but the dairy continued to distribute CRM under the name Stueve's Natural Raw Certified Milk (produced by Stueve Brothers Farms at Chino).

"Between April 1971 and March 1974, _S._ Dublin was isolated from 79 persons in California, 37 of whom had medical conditions. Their ages ranged from 1 month to 88 years; 59 were hospitalized, 16 died, and 32 infections were traced to Alta Dena CRM. Herd tests found that cattle can have localized infections that will not show up in fecal surveys [4]. _Salmonella_ organisms have been recovered 45 times since 1977 from California produced raw milk -- all from Alta Dena's CRM [5]. In 1981, 46 cases of _S._ Dublin were reported in California; in 1982, 70 cases were reported; 24% of patients reported using CRM. In 1983, 123 cases were identified, 44% reported using CRM; at least 24 of the 1983 patients had cancer. As many as 80% of patients were hospitalized and 26% died [6]. Alta Dena CRM was also implicated in the Jalisco cheese tragedy that killed 89 people [7]. Stueve refused to believe the data and claimed they were part of a conspiracy against CRM. The facts suggest that just the opposite was true. Alta Dena had strong political support. Governor Jerry Brown was a CRM user. State Senator William Campbell sponsored several bills exempting Alta Dena from control by the state; 2 such bills passed the legislature but were vetoed by Governor George Deukmejian. Alta Dena also intimidated its critics. It launched a USD 110 million personal lawsuit against the physician who testified on behalf of children for the American Academy of Pediatrics [8].

"Alta Dena's advertising claimed that CRM was the "safest, purest, most wholesome milk you can buy" and distributed "educational" materials claiming that pasteurization markedly reduced the nutritional value of milk. Alta Dena refused to put warning labels on CRM. The Berkeley Co-op reported that the warning signs it voluntarily posted were repeatedly torn down by CRM buyers. The AIDS problem in San Francisco eventually caused its city council to require such a label. Political intervention in Sacramento continued to prevent the Department of Health Services from ordering Alta Dena to pasteurize. A public interest lawsuit brought by Consumer's Union, the American Public Health Association, and the California Grey Panthers (a senior citizen consumer group) resulted in a 1985 court order requiring a warning label on CRM. Stueve continued to deny that CRM was responsible for health problems. Alta Dena financed an independent study by the UCLA School of Public Health to determine if CRM was actually a problem. Epidemiologists at UCLA estimated that more than one-third of reported _S._ Dublin infections in California from 1980-83 were attributable to raw milk consumption. It appeared that the incidence of infection was 8 to 35 per 100 000 [9]. It was determined that the relative risk of illness from _S._ Dublin for CRM users in 1983 was 158.0 based upon an estimated one pint/day/user consuming some of the 12 000 gallons produced daily [10]." - Mod.LL
