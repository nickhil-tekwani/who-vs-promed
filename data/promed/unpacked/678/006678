RABBIT VIRAL HEMORRHAIGIC DISEASES (3)
=======================================
There have been no recorded outbreaks of rabbit calicivirus disease
(formerly called viral heamorrhagic disease) in New Zealand. Tests to
check on the effect of the virus on native wildlife are currently
underway, but as things stand at the moment, any outbreak would be
treated as an unwanted outbreak of an exotic disease and active control
measures initiated.
