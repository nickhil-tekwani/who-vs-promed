Visit of the Acting Governor of North Kivu to Butembo

- The Acting Governor of North Kivu, Maitre Feller Lutaichirwa, arrived in Butembo on Fri 10 May 2019 with an inter-institutional delegation composed of the Provincial Security Committee and members of the North Kivu Provincial Assembly to conduct an assessment mission of the security situation.

- They began their visit with a hearing with the Ebola response coordinators on Fri [10 May 2019]. This Sat 11 May 2019, a social dialogue was organized between the provincial authorities and the representatives of the different social strata of the city of Butembo in the meeting hall of the town hall. Discussions focused on security and health issues. Several people took the floor, such as the president of the Butembo-Lubero Congolese Business Federation (FEC), the 1st vice-president of the Civil Society Provincial Coordination of North Kivu, and journalists.

- Butembo's response coordinator Dr Justus Nsio took the opportunity to explain the evolution of the epidemic in the city before reminding them of the importance of rapid medical care. The social dialogue closed with a firm commitment from the different sections of the population of Butembo to take ownership of the response and accept the instructions of doctors to fight against Ebola. The Interim Governor announced a high-level meeting in Kinshasa to adopt new security measures in Butembo and surrounding areas.

[The graphics are striking in their demonstration of the recent sharp increase in case numbers, a very concerning trend. And yet another unvaccinated health care worker has been infected, in Butembo, bringing the total to 98 health care workers infected. One has to ask why, when a vaccine apparently is available to frontline responders, would an unvaccinated HCW treat an infected patient unless they were unable to get the vaccination, and vaccinated care takers were not available. It does no one any good to have unvaccinated HCWs treating patients. - Mod.LK]

[2] Outbreak summaries

- Thu 9 May 2019. Disease Outbreak News update
[WHO - Disease outbreak news (abridged, edited)]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/09-may-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak response this past week continues to be hampered by insecurity. On 3 May 2019 in Katwa, a Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) team was violently attacked following the completion of a burial for a deceased EVD case. In Butembo and surrounding health zones, response activities were repeatedly halted due to a number of serious security incidents taking place from 4-6 May 2019. On 8 May 2019, a group of over 50 armed militia infiltrated the city centre. Security forces repelled the attack following intense gunfire in close proximity to staff accommodations. Although activities resumed on 9 May 2019, after almost 5 consecutive days of suspension, threats of further attacks against EVD response teams and facilities remain prevalent.

These security incidents, and especially the resultant lack of access to EVD-affected communities, remain a major impediment to the response, with teams unable to perform robust surveillance or deliver much needed treatment and immunisations. The ongoing violent attacks sow fear, perpetuate mistrust, and further compound the multitude of challenges already faced by frontline healthcare workers. Without commitment from all groups to cease these attacks, it is unlikely that this EVD outbreak can remain successfully contained in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

EVD transmission remains most intense in Katwa, Butembo, Mandima, Mabalako, Musienene, Beni and Kalunguta hotspot health zones, which collectively account for the vast majority (93%) of the 303 cases reported in the last 21 days between 17 Apr - 7 May 2019 (Figure 1 and Table 1). During this period, new cases were reported from 78 health areas within 15 of the 21 health zones affected to date (Figure 2). It is expected that the resumption of response activities will bring a substantial increase in the number of cases reported in the coming weeks due to the backlog from the disruptions.

As of 7 May 2019, a total of 1600 confirmed and probable EVD cases have been reported, of which 1069 died (case fatality of 67%). Of the total cases with recorded sex and age, 57% (907) were female, and 30% (475) were children aged less than 18 years. The number of healthcare workers affected has risen to 97 (6% of total cases). 442 EVD patients who received care at Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) have been successfully discharged.

Adapted vaccination strategies
----------------
On 7 May 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) issued new vaccination recommendations in light of the increasing number of EVD cases and continued insecurity in this outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (click here for the full recommendations). The panel made recommendations pertaining to adjusting vaccine dosages, expanding vaccine eligibility, ring vaccination operational improvements, and strengthening training of local healthcare workers to aid in the EVD response.

The rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine dosage and eligibility criteria have been revised. For high-risk individuals such as contacts and contacts of contacts, the new SAGE recommendations advise the use of 0.5mL of vaccine instead of 1mL. This revised dose has been previously used during the 2015 Ebola trial in Guinea and is expected to provide similar efficacy in this current EVD outbreak. Those at lower risks are now to receive 0.2mL instead. SAGE also recommends expanding the accessibility of the vaccine to more individuals in affected health areas. In addition to high-risk individuals, it is now recommended that individuals who are potential contacts due to their residence in the villages or neighbourhoods with incident cases (i.e. where EVD cases have been reported in the last 21 days) be offered the rVSV ZEBOV GP vaccine. SAGE believes that by expanding vaccine eligibility, this would address some of the requests from communities in affected health areas for the vaccine to be more widely available, foster greater trust, and improve willingness of communities to engage with other EVD response activities.

SAGE advised the implementation of an adaptive operational approach to ring vaccinations, implemented in 2 main methods: pop-up vaccinations and targeted geographic vaccinations. Pop-up vaccination would be conducted by inviting contacts and contacts of contacts to a previously agreed upon temporary location some distance away from the residence of contacts. In areas where accurate identification of contacts and contacts of contacts is not possible due to insecurity, targeted geographic vaccination of whole villages or quartiers would be administered at a fixed location with security present. Both of these vaccination operational methods have been utilised successfully before and are expected to make the vaccination process more efficient and secure for both healthcare providers and the patients they are caring for.

SAGE additionally recommends offering an alternative vaccine (other than rVSV-ZEBOV-GP) to those at lower risk within affected health areas or neighbouring areas. WHO has reviewed evidence provided by 2 vaccine manufacturers, and the adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein / MVA-BN (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) investigational Ebola vaccine is being considered and evaluated by a coalition led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. At this time, this vaccine is in the late stages of formal trials and is expected to be deployed to the field in the near future. These efforts are in line with previous SAGE recommendations regarding the need for more studies to assess the efficacy of additional, alternative Ebola vaccines.

SAGE also supported the proposal to introduce alternative individual informed consent forms and follow up procedures which can potentially simplify and expedite both the vaccination and safety follow up processes. Aside from pregnant women who will be actively followed up until delivery or end of pregnancy, and infants 6-12 months of age who will receive a single visit at day 21, all other case follow up will be completed through passive reporting of adverse events via telephone.

In addition to technical recommendations, WHO and partners are working closely with residents of Ebola-affected communities to empower them to take on greater ownership of the EVD response. Through intensifying training and engagement with local community members, WHO aims to have the majority of vaccination teams comprised of local healthcare providers by the end of the month. Other key elements to transferring ownership of the response to the communities includes fulfilling community requests made in relation to development projects, and ensuring all persons residing in at-risk areas are well-informed about the status of the outbreak, transmission prevention, and availability of care through further mass communication initiatives.

[3] Risk and response strategy

- Sat 11 May 2019. Butembo: 212 positive cases and 109 deaths in 3 weeks
[Radio Okapi (online translation, abridged, edited)]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/05/11/actualite/sante/ebola-butembo-212-cas-positifs-et-109-deces-en-3-semaines

At least 212 positive cases and 109 Ebola deaths have been reported in the past 3 weeks in 12 health zones under the control of the Butembo Ebola response in North Kivu. According to its coordinator, Dr Justus Nsio, who delivers these figures, the health zones of Katwa and Butembo, the current hotbed of the Ebola epidemic, are the most affected, with around 100 cases.

Dr. Justus Nsio says that the current attacks on the response teams in this region are not due to community resistance. It is rather an action of the armed groups.

"In the Butembo sub-coordination, we have 12 health zones that we manage. In the past 3 weeks, we have reported 212 cases in 8 health zones in the 12 under coordination, and there have been a total of 109 deaths reported," said Justus Nsio.

According to him, for all cases reported in the past 3 weeks, Katwa alone has reported 118 cases; followed by Butembo with 42 cases, Musyenene (22), Kalunguta (10).

"More and more, we have a good collaboration with the community and all social strata. I really think it's not a problem of community involvement, but it is isolated attacks by insurgents. So, I do not think it's the whole community that refuses the activities of the response," he said.

When the initiatives of these ill-intentioned people are mastered, according to him, and with the strategies that have been developed, we can deal with this epidemic quickly.

- 10 May 2019. Worries rise over risk of Ebola spread beyond DRC hot zones
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/05/worries-rise-over-risk-ebola-spread-beyond-drc-hot-zones

The World Health Organization's (WHO's) top official today [10 May 2019] said he was "profoundly worried" about the rising threat of Ebola spreading to other parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and to neighboring countries, as the country's health ministry today [10 May 2019] reported 23 new cases.

On Twitter, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said most operations have resumed in the wake of the most recent attacks, but the disruptions and a testing backlog will lead to a rise in the number of cases reported over the coming days.

Since the current outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces began in August 2018, several violent incidents, some with resulting community protest, have disrupted the outbreak response and triggered spikes in new cases.

"When we cannot reach people, they do not get the chance to be vaccinated or to receive treatments if they fall ill. The tragedy is that we have the technical means to stop Ebola, but until all parties halt attacks on the response, it will be very difficult to end this outbreak," Tedros said.

He also said that a major surge in political and financial support from all national and international groups is urgently needed to help stop the outbreak.

New probable cases added, UN official visits Butembo
---------------

In its daily update, the DRC health ministry said the 23 new cases were from 9 different locations, including 5 from Katwa and 5 from Butembo, 2 of the main hot spots. Also, officials added 22 more probable cases to the total, which are people who died in the community between 30 Jan and 8 May 2019 for whom it wasn't possible to get samples but after investigations were found to have links to confirmed cases.
Response teams are still investigating 310 suspected Ebola cases.

Nine more people died from their infections, 8 of them from 6 different communities and one in Katwa's Ebola treatment centers. The fatalities push the death total in the outbreak to 1105.

In other developments, the ministry said Leila Zerrougui, the United Nations secretary-general's special representative in the DRC and head of the group's DRC peacekeeping mission MONUSCO, visited response teams in Butembo today [10 May 2019] to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Butembo and surrounding areas.

She reiterated support for the response teams and urged groups to better align their intelligence to respond to challenges and build trust with communities.

Public health needs peace negotiators
---------------------
Yesterday [9 May 2019] in a New England Journal of Medicine commentary on epidemic preparedness, Jeremy Farrar, MD, PhD, director of the Wellcome Trust, said armed conflicts in unstable parts can fuel disease transmission as people try to move, making safe caregiving all but impossible.
[See commentary at https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1902683.]

He said the northeastern DRC setting for the Ebola outbreak has been tragically unstable for 20 years, and the tragic impact of the instability became clear when the outbreak began last August 2018.

The outbreak might be impossible to contain, as long as violence repeatedly cripples the response. "And every day the epidemic continues, the risk of a national and regional health disaster grows," Farrar warned.

New approaches are needed to resolve tensions within and between countries, local communities, armed factions, groups of health and humanitarian workers, and national and international security forces, he said.

"Peace negotiators with experience in conflict resolution are needed in public health now. Without their skills, potential pandemics will fester unchecked in vulnerable regions of the world, leading, sooner or later, to catastrophe," Farrar said, adding that Germany is in a strong position to lead efforts to stabilize global health in insecure situations, given its prioritization of preparedness issues during its G7 and G20 presidencies.

- Thu 9 May 2019. Attacks on Ebola clinics escalate as outbreak intensifies
[NY Post, abridged, edited]
https://nypost.com/2019/05/09/attacks-on-ebola-clinics-escalate-as-outbreak-intensifies/

According to WHO data, since January 2019, there have been 130 attacks that have caused 4 deaths and 38 injuries in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Of those, 97 attacks impacted health personnel and 44 incidents impacted health facilities.

Antagonists are also reported to have ravaged handwashing appliances placed in the city over the past week and are reported even to have unleashed violence on a security attachment team tending to the remains of a woman who died from Ebola.

Late last month [April 2019], Reuters also reported that health care workers in Butembo took to the streets with signs reading "Ebola Exists" in protest of the burgeoning counterplots against them and have threatened to go on strike if security is not improved, which would no doubt prove another blow to curbing the latest surge.

More than 100 anti-government rebel groups are known to operate in the region, which has long been rocked by instability and conflict.

"Identifying specific groups responsible for specific attacks is difficult. Many of these groups resist control by the central government, and they see this public health response as a threat posed by the government," explained Gregory D. Koblentz, Director of the Biodefense Graduate Program at George Mason University.

"Others have a more general suspicion of outsiders. Finally, health centers and health care workers may be caught in the cross-fire of competition between different groups. The conflict between so many armed groups is a toxic stew that makes public health campaigns exceedingly difficult."

In addition to combatting the deadly disease's dissemination and dire security scenario, professionals are also battling deep-seated community distrust. Rather than seeking medical help for symptoms, many locals are opting to stay home amid a spread of conspiracy theories that range from Ebola being "brought in" to the community by adversaries. It is commonly called the "Ebola business," with concerns that it is merely a western for-profit scam.

- Fri 10 May 2019. Struggling with Scale: Ebola's Lessons for the Next Pandemic
[WHO ReliefWeb report from Center for Global Development
https://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/struggling-scale-ebola-s-lessons-next-pandemic

[Original report published on 9 May 2019
https://www.cgdev.org/publication/struggling-scale-ebolas-lessons-next-pandemic
https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/struggling-scale-ebolas-lessons-next-pandemic.pdf]

The next global pandemic is a matter of when, not if. Preparing for this inevitability requires that policymakers understand not just the science of limiting disease transmission or engineering a drug but also the practical challenges of expanding a response strategy to a regional or global level. Achieving success at such scales is largely an issue of operational, strategic, and policy choices, areas of pandemic preparedness that remain underexplored.

The response to the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa illuminates these challenges and highlights steps toward better preparedness. Ebola was a known disease whose basic transmission pathways and control strategies were understood. Yet traditional Ebola control strategies were premised on small, non-urban outbreaks, and they rapidly proved inadequate as the disease reached urban environments, forcing policymakers to develop new strategies and operational platforms for containing the outbreak, which generated unique policy challenges and political pressures. Lacking a blueprint for controlling Ebola at scale, response leaders scrambled to catch up as the disease began threatening the wider West African region.

This report explores the lessons of the Ebola outbreak through the lens of the US and UN policymakers who were forced to construct an unprecedented response in real time. It tells the story of their choices around 4 major policy challenges:
1. Operationalizing the US government response
2. Balancing the politics and the science of travel restrictions
3. Defining the role of a reluctant military
4. Coordinating complex international partnerships

The report draws on interviews with 19 high-level US and UN policymakers, a desk review of after-action reports, and the author's own experiences while leading the response efforts of the US Agency for International Development (USAID).

Threats by text, a mob outside the door: What health workers face in the Ebola zone
----------------------------
Karin Huster, a nurse and field coordinator for Ebola with the aid group Doctors Without Borders, says the takeaway [from the current outbreak situation] is clear: "We need to really change the way we think about Ebola."

Huster was evacuated from the outbreak zone in March 2019 after 2 Ebola treatment centers run by the aid group were burned to the ground. She argues that the extreme distrust of authority in Northeastern Congo has made the usual strategy for combatting Ebola totally counter-productive.

She notes that there are many diseases that threaten lives in Eastern Congo. Malaria is particularly devastating, for example, and has claimed far more lives than Ebola. But right now, Ebola is singled out for special treatment outside of regular health clinics in ways that mystify and alienate the local population.

"Biosafety is still in the forefront -- you know bio-security -- you know, bio-everything," says Huster.

As soon as a person shows symptoms, workers in hazmat suits whisk them off for testing at a "transit center" surrounded by orange netting.

A patient who has the disease is sent to a treatment unit that's even more isolated, while teams of foreigners in expensive cars descend on their neighborhood, seeking out anyone who might have been exposed to a patient so they can be vaccinated. And if the patient dies, the family does not get to take home the body. Yet another team of people in hazmat suits shows up to bury the deceased.

The approach makes sense from a purely medical standpoint. But in a country with a history of oppression by authorities, it's practically tailor-made to raise suspicion and resistance.

Huster says instead, the government and the World Health Organization -- which is coordinating the contribution by foreign experts -- need to massively lower the profile of the Ebola response.

"It would be so much better if we could integrate Ebola inside of the health systems," she says. Essentially treat it like any other serious, but manageable disease."

[Dr. Michel Yao, who is leading WHO's on-the-ground response to Ebola, is putting into practice] some of the suggestions being made by MSF. For instance, the policy is now to "start releasing people whose 1st round of an Ebola test is negative, rather than making them wait an additional day or more at a transit center for a 2nd, confirmatory test.

And they are even letting some Ebola patients get their care at home.

"It's not too many [cases]," says Yao. "But we have a few experiences where people who were resisting to come to the treatment centers remain at home. And we train relatives to take care of them."

WHO has also worked with UNICEF and the government to set up what are essentially neighborhood committees that are picking people from the community to be trained to bury bodies and trace the contacts of Ebola patients instead of leaving the work to outsiders.

- Fri 10 May 2019. Dangerous situation
[International Rescue Committee (abridged, edited)]
https://www.rescue.org/press-release/ebola-cases-spike-ircs-david-miliband-visits-drc-situation-far-more-dangerous

As Ebola cases spike, IRC's David Miliband visits DRC: "The situation is far more dangerous than the statistic of 1000 deaths, itself the 2nd largest in history, suggests."

- The April 2019 number alone (406 cases) would be the 4th largest outbreak in history;

- Ebola response needs major reset to earn trust of local people.

The IRC's President and CEO, David Miliband, has been in Goma meeting teams combating the disease. Travel to Katwa and Butembo was impossible due to the ongoing insecurity, which has forced IRC staff to significantly scale down work in the area.

"I've been speaking to doctors who warn that this outbreak could last for another year.

"We also know that this outbreak is impacting women more than men. 55% of cases are female; women and girls tell our staff that they are at increased risk as they are the primary caretakers of the sick. Moreover, women and girls are at greater risk of violence due to the increased stress in households and because they are required to more frequently collect water, a journey that puts them at risk of being attacked.

"We look forward to discussing with all those involved in the Ebola response the necessary steps to achieve greater trust, coordination and impact. We know affected communities are key to the success of the response, and their trust needs to be earned. The international system needs each part of the response -- UN, donors, NGOs -- to play to their strengths. In addition, coordination of activities and sharing of information needs to be upgraded. Experience from other crises tells us that surveillance needs to be locally led, and the lessons of other outbreaks about the mobilization of communities brought center stage. Security needs to be built from the bottom up, community by community."
