We are not arbovirologists. Thus, this letter is written to ask for help in
analyzing sequences originating with NYC encephalitis isolates.
Our laboratory is dedicated to identification and characterization of
infectious agents using molecular biological methods that detect microbes
difficult to isolate using more conventional techniques; thus, we were
delighted to help when invited by Drs. Huang and Grady of the New York State
Department of Health to participate in investigating this outbreak.
Brain samples from 5 encephalitis victims were submitted for analysis.
After purifying RNA from samples and synthesizing appropriate reagents we
initiated our studies on the morning of Tue 21 Sep1999. Our approach was
guided by immunohistochemical findings from Sharif Zaki (CDC-Atlanta)
indicating flavivirus protein in the brain of at least one outbreak
casualty. The first results demonstrating the presence of flavivirus
genetic footprints in brains of 3 patients were found in the late evening of
Wed 22 Sep 1999. This information was communicated to Dr. Huang by phone
and email on the morning of Thu 23 Sep 1999. That same day material
representing 3 regions of the flavivirus genome from 2 of the patients was
cloned and subjected to sequence analysis.
On the morning of Fri 24 Sep 1999 we informed Dr. Huang by phone and email
that the viral sequences were virtually identical in the 2 patients and
implicated a Kunjin/West Nile flavivirus. Throughout the day this
information was communicated to other members of the virology community at
UC-Irvine and the New York State Department of Health. Dr. Grady asked that
we submit a letter by telefax for distribution to other members of the New
York State Department of Health. This was written and signed by members of
the UC-Irvine team, telefaxed to Dr. Grady and submitted to the UC-Irvine
College of Medicine Deans Office and Publicity Officer. Later Friday
evening we communicated our findings to Dr. Rima Khabbaz of the CDC-Atlanta.
On the morning of Sat 25 Sep 1999, we communicated our findings to Dr. Marci
Layton, Assistant Commissioner for Infectious Diseases, New York City
Department of Health; Ms. Kristine Smith, New York State Department of
Health; and the CDC Team at Fort Collins. Please note that all references
to chronology are based on Pacific Daylight Time.

We are presently trying to determine the complete sequence of the human
isolates. We would be most appreciative for an opportunity to collaborate
with established workers in the field who have access to sequences not
present in standard databases.
