Almost 1000 people in Bedfordshire have a liver disease, but many of
them don't know it. Figures released by the Health Protection Agency
show that 989 have the hepatitis C virus, which can lead to cancer.
Meanwhile in Luton [the population centre], there are said to be 555
people with the disease.

Thursday [28 Jul 2011] was World Hepatitis Day and The Hepatitis C
Trust launched a campaign -- the Great British C Party -- to raise
awareness of the serious impact the disease can have. It will
encourage people to host dinner parties filled with liver-friendly
treats [?]. More than 14 700 people in the East of England are thought
to have hepatitis C, but only one in 6 are aware of it.

[The Health Protection Agency (HPA) Weekly Report, Volume 5 No 30
http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr reveals that more than an estimated 216
000 people in the UK are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus
(HCV). The data for Bedfordshire and Cumbria (see: Hepatitis C - UK:
(England) Cumbria 20110730.2293) reflect the extent of the problem and
the current lack of awareness of the situation throughout the United
Kingdom.

The data in the HPA Weekly Report are derived from the document
"Hepatitis C in the UK: 2011 report" published on the HPA website to
coincide with the World Health Organisation's World Hepatitis Day [28
Jul 2011]. In England, an estimated 161 000 -- 0.4 percent of the
adult population -- are chronically infected, according to this
report. The estimated numbers chronically infected in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland are 39 000, 12 000 and 4000 respectively, and
increasing. The full document entitled "Hepatitis C in the UK: 2011
report, Health Protection Agency July 2011" can be downloaded at:
http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1309969906418. The
updated estimates in this document indicate that around 216 000
individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis C in the UK. At
present, much of the prevalent infection is concentrated in
marginalised populations, with injecting drug users (IDUs) at greatest
risk of acquiring infection.
