Rift Valley Fever in Mauritania
-----------------------------
Emergency report

Translation of information received on 25 Dec 2002 from Dr Mokhtar Fall,
Deputy Director, Department of Animal Production and Agriculture, Ministry
of Rural Development and Environment, Nouakchott:

Report date: 25 Dec 2002.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 1 Nov 2002.
Estimated date of first infection: 25 Oct 2002.

Outbreaks:
locations:
1. Aleg (17 deg 05 min N - 13 deg 91 min W), Branka region -- 2 outbreaks
2. Foum Gleita (M'bout) (16 deg 16 min 07 sec N - 12 deg 66 min 07 sec W),
Gorgol region -- 1 outbreak

Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species/susceptible/cases/deaths/destroyed/slaughtered
ovines, caprines/500/180/0/0/0

(Local breeds of sheep, goats, cattle, camels and donkeys are present.
Because of transhumance (extensive rearing system), the number of animals by
species cannot be accurately determined).

Diagnosis:

A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made: National Laboratory for Animal
Production and Veterinary Research, Dakar, and Pasteur Institute, Dakar,
Senegal.

B. Diagnostic tests used: virus neutralisation test and ELISA. The sera were
found to be negative to virus isolation.

Epidemiology:

A. Mode of spread: vector-transmitted.

B. Other epidemiological details:
-- The two outbreaks in Aleg are 20 km apart.
-- The outbreak in Foum Gleita was notable for the occurrence of a human
case, caused by contact with infected animals. The person in question
survived the infection without after-effects.****
[emphasis added - Mod.JW]

Control measures: screening.

[The report mentions 180 "cases" in 500 susceptible animals, without any
mortalities, even no mention of abortions. This might indicate that the
report is based upon retrospective serological investigations in the
animals. It may be assumed that the samples were taken by the joint mission
(Veterinary Services/ Ministry of Health) sent to the region at the end of
November 2002 following the earlier reporting of an RVF case in a human, as
indicated in ProMED-mail posting 20021129.5927.

RVF was initially recorded in Mauritania in 1987, following the opening of
Diama Dam at the mouth of the Senegal River, in an area where the virus was
present but not generally recognized. The dam project created additional
breeding grounds for mosquitoes carrying the disease, and resulted in more
than 200 human deaths from RVF. - Mod.AS]
