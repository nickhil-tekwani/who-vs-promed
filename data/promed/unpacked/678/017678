I wouldn't presume to be someone with "expertise", but birds don't get
histoplasmosis (due to higher body temperature?). So there isn't any
[_Histoplasma_ fungus in their feces (bats can be infected/shed fungus in
feces). The _Histoplasma_ are in the soil (naturally occurring soil fungus
in some parts of the world...Montreal?), and concentrations of bird
droppings change the "chemistry" of the soils they fall/lie on, promoting
the growth of histoplasmosis (if present) over other (competing) soil
microorganisms.
The "question/problem" of bird droppings is a common one (we've had
questions about the potential for adverse health effects from pigeons [and
their droppings living in our parking garages, where people walk for
exercise, etc). [Yes accumulations of bird droppings can get nasty, but
when they fall/lie on concrete/asphalt, histoplasmosis is not a potential
human health issue/risk.
