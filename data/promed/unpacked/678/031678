China steps up research into genes causing fatal outcome of
Schistosoma infection
-----------------------------------------------
China expects to decode in 5 years a snail-fever-susceptibility gene
that may help to improve diagnosis and prevent the disease -- which
currently plagues 843 000 Chinese -- from developing into the final
stage [2003 figure]. "The gene will help doctors find out who, of all
the snail fever sufferers, will end up [being] a terminal patient,"
said Dr. Li Yuesheng, director of the Hunan Institute of Parasitic
Diseases, based in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan
Province.

Among the sick, only about 1.8 to 3 percent will reach the final
stage, which is characterized by a protuberant belly filled with a
build-up of fluid in the abdomen, he said.

Dr. Li has just won an international research scholar award for
infectious diseases and parasitology at the U.S. Howard Hughes
Medical Institute and will be getting CNY 3.5 million [USD 422 900]
in research grants in the coming 5 years, or about USD 84 000 dollars
annually. Li, who has contributed greatly to snail fever research
over the past 32 years, is the 1st Chinese scientist to get the
grants. Snail fever, also known as schistosomiasis, is a parasitic
disease that slowly eats away at the liver, intestines and spleen. It
is 2nd only to malaria in the number of cases it causes.

The World Health Organization now estimates that some 200 million
people worldwide are infected and that 120 million display symptoms,
while another 600 million people are at risk of infection. In central
China and particularly in hot and humid Hunan -- home to 66 million
people and one of the country's most important bread baskets -- snail
fever still poses a major health risk, said Dr. Li.

According to a latest survey by the provincial health department,
Hunan makes up almost 1/4th, or 210 000, of China's total infections.
The disease also plagues Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Sichuan and
Yunnan provinces.

[ProMED has previously -- in 2003 and 2004 -- reported an increase in
human Schistosoma infections in China, and it was estimated that
approximately 65 million Chinese live in areas with risk of
Schistosoma infections. - Mod.EP]
