QUARAI, Brazil ­ On Sunday [20 May, 3 more outbreaks of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) [were reported in Brazil and the authorities prepared to
slaughter herds of animals. The new cases bring to 8 the number of FMD
outbreaks confirmed in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul
this month. All the outbreaks [have been in towns in the same region, near
the country's border with Uruguay.
Officials prepared to start killing herds of cattle and to bury the
carcasses in deep pits, while military police stepped up border patrols
trying to contain the spread of the disease, which causes fever and
blisters on cattle and other cloven-hoofed animals. "We are only going to
kill the infected animals," said Fatima Brandisire, deputy head of the
state agricultural secretariat's animal production department, on a visit
to an infected farm. The secretariat said [that about 40 animals in a herd
in the town of Dom Pedrito were infected with the disease. The number of
cattle involved in 2 other outbreaks in nearby Alegrete was unknown.
Brazil confirmed its fifth case of the disease on Saturday [19 May in
Quarai, near the Uruguayan border, 2 days after officials completed the
slaughter of 323 animals in the region. The cattle were killed and their
carcasses split to prevent them from rotting and exploding inside the
deep-dug pits.
Mass vaccinations continued throughout the region and military and sanitary
roadblocks all along the border with Uruguay carried out rigorous checks.
Vehicles crossing the roadblocks ran their tires through a water and iodine
solution, and passengers were made to step on mats soaked in the same
mixture in a bid to contain the spread of the disease. "We are trying to do
prevention here, but the virus spreads through the air, and there is not
much we can do about that," said Mauro Furtado, a police officer at a
roadblock on the Brazil-Uruguay border.
FMD has ravaged farms in Britain and other parts of Europe, and there have
been widespread outbreaks in Argentina and Uruguay. After the first
outbreaks were confirmed in Rio Grande do Sul 2 weeks ago, the rest of
Brazil, Europe, and parts of Asia banned imports of beef from the state.
The government has said the bans could slice $300 million off Brazil's meat
exports this year, estimated at $2.5 billion.
