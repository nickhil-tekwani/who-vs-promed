The National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi announced the admission in hospital of a young man in the Northern Province of Yen Bai who was infested with a rare worm.

The 23-year-old man was hospitalized when he was suffering abscesses on his legs and then the abscesses spread to his arms. Additionally, he had fatigue and pain for many days.

Surgeons later have removed 5 rare intestinal worms with a length of 30-60 centimeters [12-24 in] from the abscesses in his hands.

Head of the hospital's Surgery Ward Dr Tran Thuong Viet said the worm had never been discovered in Viet Nam before but is commonly found in rural areas of Africa with scientific name _Dracunculus medinensis_ -- a species of roundworm that causes Guinea worm disease.

There is no specific medication [for the disease caused by this worm], doctors have used the usual dose to remove the worms.

Through investigation, doctors found that the man usually eats living fish and crabs. As the worm is rare in the country, physicians said that it is necessary to study water sources where the man lives because the worm eggs are spread via a water source.

[It is highly unlikely that this case is due to the Guinea worm _Dracunculus medinensis_. Guinea worm has never be described outside Africa. Transmission is by drinking water contaminated with small copepods or eating raw fish. Recently dogs have been identified as hosts as well (https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/dracunculiasis/index.html).

If this is indeed _D. medinensis_, it will be the 1st time the parasite has been reported outside of Africa. With an incubation time of up to 18 months this means contamination in the environment and probably more human cases.

It is strongly advised that the material removed from the patients is sent for molecular analysis. - Mod.EP

A number of tissue nematodes and larva migrans syndromes, some associated with consuming aquatic animals, can be found in Southeast Asia. Histopathology and DNA analysis of the recovered worms will be key to determining whether this case is a unusual manifestation of a previously reported parasitic nematode, or in fact a novel parasitic infection. - Mod.LXL
