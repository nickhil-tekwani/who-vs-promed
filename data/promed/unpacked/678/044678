[Though the report above is termed "an immediate notification,"
apparently indicative of a new outbreak, this case is, most likely, a
continuation of the FMD serotype O outbreak which reportedly started
on 4 Mar 2009 and was declared as "resolved" on 18 Mar 2009. For its
summary, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7802>;
it includes the following epidemiological comments:

"In order to ensure the eradication of FMD virus, Chinese Taipei
[Taiwan] used non-vaccinated pigs as sentinel animals on every farm.
The number of non-vaccinated pigs has gradually increased since August
2008. The virus was detected in these 2 farms with non-vaccinated
sentinel pigs. The 8 cases in Yun-Lin were immediately destroyed on 4
Feb 2009 and the other 60 susceptible pigs were destroyed on 5 Feb
2009. The 23 cases in Chang-Hua were immediately destroyed on 9 Feb
2009 and the other 586 susceptible pigs were completely destroyed on
18 Feb 2009. The surveillance in the 3-km-radius of these 2 index
farms is completed. All the 75 farms found near these 2 areas have been
disinfected. No other infected farm has been found." - Mod.AS]
