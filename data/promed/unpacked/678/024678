Rural anthrax outbreak: bovine, human, and sundry other species, Dolores, Buenos Aires province
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An acute outbreak of bovine anthrax has occurred on an estancia [farm] in the county of Dolores in the Province of Buenos Aires, with extravasation of blood from natural openings. In spite of the current law no. 6703 of compulsory vaccination, the herd had not been vaccinated.

There was a delay of 10 days before their veterinarian was contacted and in that time 50 animals out of the herd of 300 head had died with similar signs. Many had been skinned and as a result the gauchos [estancia workers] involved had cutaneous anthrax lesions on their hands and forearms. The veterinarian informed the local family doctor who prescribed antibiotics for those affected. Deaths were also noted in one farm dog, 2 pigs, and 1 javelina [peccary or skunk pig], which had been feeding on the carcasses.

This estancia borders another which suffered anthrax in 2014 (see ProMED-mail posting Anthrax - Argentina (04): (BA) bovine 20140331.2370110). Dolores is an integral part of the Rio Salado drainage, a key zone for cattle rearing and breeding, with alkaline soils, subject to flooding, and a long history of livestock anthrax. The provincial (Direccion de Ganaderia) and national (SENASA) authorities have been notified and have initiated the necessary response and control procedures.

Whenever one has a control and surveillance programme in place, there will always be the sporadic idiot who does not do what he is meant to, such as this Argentine rancher. Cleaning up and disinfecting 50 bleeding carcasses is not a simple afternoon's work. The good news is that such events are infrequent and can be used as a gross and immediate example with names to the other estancieros (ranchers) of what happens when they don't do as they are told [vaccinate].

Blood extravasation, though in the textbooks, is not common in bovine anthrax cases. But when it happens it can be spectacular, as it must have been in this outbreak. In my 1st anthrax investigation in 1972 was of an outbreak at the Compton institute in the UK where 3 cows died when they bled out on the track to the milking shed. There must have been some 30 sq ft (2.8 sq m) of blood. It is a job to disinfect and clean up, and stop it being tracked around by staff, tractors -- and you have to keep other stock away from it, as they are lethally attracted to the salt in the blood.

As usual, our thanks to Ramon for this report. - Mod.MHJ
