The Environmental Protection Ministry expressed concern over the growing number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases reported in over the past year, and has been able to obtain NIS 10 million (roughly USD 2.6 million) in government funds to curb a potential outbreak. The funds are to be allocated across 3 years.

The Health Ministry has reports of 293 patients in 2011 -- double the number of cases reported in 2010.

According to the Environmental Protection Ministry's data, over 1650 people in 50 communities is Israel have contracted the Oriental sore over the past decade, especially around the Sea of Galilee, the Judea Mountains, the western Negev, the Arava, and the Beit Shean Valley.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis, commonly known as "Oriental sore," or "Aleppo boil," is a skin infection caused by a single-celled parasite. It is usually transmitted by sandflies.

The ministry appealed to the cabinet for funds meant to help at-risk communities, in the form of setting up sandfly traps and building fences to keep the rock hyrax -- which is a known carrier -- out.

"This is a difficult disease that has inflicted many and left them scarred, literally," Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan said. "After years of ignoring this hazard, the government is taking on dealing with this national infliction."

[_Leishmania tropica_ and _L. major_ causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) have been identified in jackals, foxes, and rock hyrax throughout Israel (Talmi-Frank D et al: _Leishmania tropica_ infection in golden jackals and red foxes, Israel. Emerg Infect Dis. 2010; 16(12): 1973-5; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3294571/ and Talmi-Frank D et al: _Leishmania tropica_ in rock hyraxes (_Procavia capensis_) in a focus of human cutaneous leishmaniasis. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2010; 82(5): 814-8; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2861385/).

CL has been slowly increasing in Israel at least over the past decade (Vinitsky O et al: Geographic and epidemiologic analysis of the cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreak in northern Israel, 2000-2003. Isr Med Assoc J. 2010; 12(11): 652-6; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21243862).

Visceral leishmaniasis, VL, caused by _Leishmania infantum_ has also returned to Israel after being absent for 30 years, with dogs as the main reservoir (Nasereddin A et al: Molecular fingerprinting of _Leishmania infantum_ strains following an outbreak of visceral leishmaniasis in central Israel. J Clin Microbiol. 2005; 43(12): 6054-9; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1317210/ and Hamarsheh O et al: Serological and molecular survey of _Leishmania_ parasites in apparently healthy dogs in the West Bank, Palestine. Parasit Vectors. 2012; 5(1): 183; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22937916). - Mod.EP
