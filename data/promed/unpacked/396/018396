[Mongolia is divided into 21 aimags (provinces). The 3 FMD-affected
aimags, namely Dornod, Sukhbaatar, and Khentii, are situated in the
north eastern flank of Mongolia, bordering Russia and China. The
surface of these 3 provinces combined covers 18.3 percent of the total
surface (1 564 115 sq/km, 603 909 sq/mi) of Mongolia. See map at
<http://www.ancientnomadic.mn/main/about.htm>.

The current follow-up report to the OIE has been preceded by 3
previous Mongolian reports on the ongoing FMDV-O epizootic: an
'immediate notification' (30 Aug 2010), follow-up report no. 1 (11 Sep
2010), and follow-up report no. 2 (16 Oct 2010). They present a rather
scanty reporting record, in view of the OIE-Code requirement for
weekly submissions. The exceptionally low morbidity rate reported
above (0.26 percent) is rather surprising, particularly in view of the
media reports, such as the one cited in ProMED-mail archive
20101109.4057, saying: "As of 8 Nov 2010, the FMD in Dornod and
Sukhbaatar provinces forced the authorities and herding families [to]
eliminate over 24 000 heads of livestock and the Government has spent
MNT 3.2 billion [approx USD 2.5 million] for its efforts to fight
against the disease."

The continued incidence of disease while mass vaccinations are being
carried out calls for clarification. Have vaccinated animals been
affected? The inclusion of the lab test 'non-structural protein ELISA'
may indicate that such a phenomenon (disease in vaccinated animals)
may have taken place or been suspected: antibodies to viral
nonstructural proteins (NSPs) can be used as indicators of infection,
irrespective of vaccination status. For OIE's Manual requirements re
NSPs antibody tests, see article 2 (d), page 12 of chapter 2.1.5.

On 12 Oct 2010, the WRLFMD, Pirbright, received 18 virus isolates
(batch WRLFMD/2010/00033) from Mongolia. Their genotyping has been
completed and is awaiting report approval; see, with preliminary data,
