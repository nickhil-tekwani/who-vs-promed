Abstract
_Anopheles stephensi_ mosquitoes, efficient vectors in parts of Asia and Africa, were found in 75.3% of water sources surveyed and contributed to 80.9% of wild-caught anopheles mosquitoes in Awash Sebat Kilo, Ethiopia. High susceptibility of these mosquitoes to _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ infection presents a challenge for malaria control in the Horn of Africa.

Conclusions
_An. stephensi_ mosquitoes have spread from Asia throughout the Horn of Africa, detected in Djibouti in 2012 (11), Ethiopia in 2016 (12), and Sudan in 2019 (3). The widescale presence of An. stephensi mosquitoes in developmental stages in artificial water bodies demonstrates that these mosquitoes are firmly established in an urban setting in Ethiopia, located on the main transportation corridor from Djibouti to Addis Ababa. Detection of 4 haplotypes suggests independent arrival of different populations or heterogeneity arising after importation of the mosquito species. Our mosquito feeding experiments predominantly included highly infective patients with clinical _P. vivax_ infection (10,13). Although feeding rates for the membrane-adapted colony of _An. arabiensis_ mosquitoes were high, mosquito infection rates were significantly higher for _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes. Our detection of salivary gland sporozoites establishes that sporogonic development of local _P. vivax_ can be completed by _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes. We recruited fewer patients with clinical _P. falciparum_ infection, who were less likely than _P. vivax_ patients to infect mosquitoes (10). Despite a modest number of observations, our findings demonstrate that local _P. falciparum_ isolates are also capable of infecting _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes and are further supported by detection of _P. falciparum_ and P. vivax-infected wild-caught adult mosquitoes.

Spread of _An. stephensi_ mosquitoes poses risk for increased _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_ receptivity and local transmission in urban Africa. Given mosquito preference for human-made containers (14), our findings support integrated vector management recommended by the World Health Organization under the Global Vector Control Response (15). Management may include integrated surveillance and control of other vectors such as _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes for larval source management.

_P. vivax_ is common in Eritrea and Ethiopia. This was also found in a recent review (Howes RE, et al. _Plasmodium vivax_ transmission in Africa. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015;9(11):e0004222. Published 20 Nov 2015. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0004222), which also suggested that _P. vivax_ was found throughout Central and West Africa. However, this isolated report was based on serology and microscopy. Serology is well known to be widely cross reactive between the human malaria species, and microscopy can be misinterpreted. Thus, molecular diagnosis must be regarded as the gold standard. - Mod.EP

_A. stephensi_ is already established in 3 countries in Africa and has been on the continent for several years, so the report above is not a new finding. It seems certain that this mosquito will spread, and the non-infested African countries are unlikely to be able to stop it from becoming established. The above report does not indicate that there is an organized and supported effort to prevent its spread to other countries in Africa. It is indeed unfortunate that this efficient malaria vector is likely to become established in urban centers of Africa. - Mod.TY
