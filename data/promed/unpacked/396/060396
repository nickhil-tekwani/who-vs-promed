Rabies advisory issued in Pinal County
--------------------------------------
Pinal County health officials have issued a rabies advisory following
separate animal attacks on 2 men near Oracle and San Manuel. Both men
have been treated [with post exposure prophylaxis - Mod.TG] to
prevent a potential rabies infection.

Authorities say an Oracle man was attacked by a bobcat while walking
his dog 23 Dec 2009. 2 days later, a dead bobcat was found in a
neighbor's yard. State lab officials determined the animal had
rabies, according to a statement of the Pinal County Public Health
Services District.

"While it isn't possible to prove this was the same bobcat, it is
likely that it is," said Tom Schryer, public health director for
Pinal County. "The man who was attacked described the bobcat's
behavior as unusual. Soon after an infected animal starts exhibiting
unusual, erratic behavior due to the rabies infection, it dies."

Another man was exposed to a rabid skunk near San Manuel.

11 animals submitted to the state lab by Pinal County have tested
positive for the disease this year [2009]. Among the animals were the
bobcat, 7 bats, and 3 skunks.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, rabies
is a viral disease that infects the central nervous system. Initial
symptoms can include a fever or headache and may give way to
neurological symptoms, like insomnia, partial paralysis, or
hallucinations. Death usually occurs within days after symptoms
appear.

Pinal County Public Health recommends taking precautions:
- keep people and pets away from wild animals. Do not pick up, touch,
or feed wild or unfamiliar animals, especially sick or wounded ones.
If someone has been bitten or scratched, or has had contact with the
animal, report it immediately to animal control or health officials;
- vaccinate all dogs and cats against rabies. Pets should be kept in
a fenced yard;
- take precautions when camping, hunting, or fishing. Avoid sleeping
on the open ground without the protection of a closed tent or camper.
Keep pets on a leash and do not allow them to wander.

For more information, contact the Pinal County Public Health Services
District at 520-866-7138 or the Arizona Department of Health Services
at 602-364-4562.

[If the dog was large, or barking, it may help explain why the bobcat
attacked the man instead of the dog. But, then again there is no
explaining the behavior of a neurologically affected animal. The
bobcat has already tested positive for rabies, so it would be helpful
to know which variant rabies the bobcat had.

Earlier in 2009 [see ProMED-mail 20091107.3843], the bat variant
strain of rabies was reported in skunks. It is possible it is the
same in this case. ProMED-mail would be grateful if a health
authority could inform us of the strain variants these animals had. -
