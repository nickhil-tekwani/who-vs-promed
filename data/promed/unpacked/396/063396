A viral epidemic raging in several districts of Nepal's remote mountainous
areas -- claiming more than 600 deaths in one month.
Newspapers report daily of disease in Jumla, Kalikot, and Dolpa, the worst
affected of the districts that lie in the northwest of this impoverished
Himalayan country. Nepal's government machinery has been largely unable to
respond with the urgency required to halt the spread of the epidemic.
Initially the Health Ministry did not admit there was an epidemic but,
after he undertook a trip to the area, Health Minister Pradip Nepal
acknowledged the seriousness of the scale of illness. The minister then
ordered medicines and doctors be sent to the affected villages, but by that
time it was already too late.
Dr. Dipak Sigdel, the lone doctor at the small Jumla hospital, said in a
telephone interview that entire villages were reeling from the epidemic.
"The medicines can't last for more than a week," he added. Nepal's roughly
21 million people are among the poorest in the world -- per capita income
is just $200 a year. Kathmandu, the capital, has government hospitals and
several well equipped private hospitals for the upper and middle classes
who can afford to pay for expensive health care. Nearly half of Nepal's
1,200-odd doctors reside in Kathmandu.
Jumla and Kalikot districts are relatively undeveloped. Inaccessible by
road, Jumla, for instance, has only one small hospital and one telephone
for its 40,000 people. Villagers routinely trek to reach Surkhet, the
nearest town that is a week's walk from Jumla.
Because of the high incidence of smoking among both men and women, and the
use of firewood for cooking in the damp, unventilated houses, "their lungs
are already damaged by the smoke. When an epidemic strikes, it quickly
becomes a disaster (here)," he explained.
By last count, 315 people had succumbed to viral influenza in Kalikot
district alone, according to the chief district administrator Yadav Prasad
Dhungana. In Jumla, the toll has climbed to 351. Twenty-seven have died in
Dolpa. In addition, deaths have been reported from Mugu and Humla districts.
Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Centre (EDCC) in
Kathmandu say that the toll is mostly the result of viral influenza. "We
have identified the disease as viral influenza but we don't know which
strain of the virus is responsible," EDCC chief Dr. Mahendra Bahadur Bista
said.
The government and officials of the World Health Organization (WHO) have
collected blood from infected victims and sent the samples to Bangkok for
analysis. A WHO official, L. Shreshta, said, "the results could take an
additional four weeks to arrive and only then can the strain of the virus
be conclusively identified."
An official in an international health agency, requesting anonymity, said,
"the Health Ministry did not learn any lessons on how to respond to a
public health crisis".
