Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2018: 18
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 22

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 10
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2018: 53
Total number of cVDPV cases (all types) in 2017: 96

Headlines
- 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) are reported from Niger, linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak in neighbouring Nigeria.

Summary of newly reported viruses this week
- Afghanistan: 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental samples;
- Pakistan: 5 new WPV1-positive environmental samples;
- Nigeria: 3 cases of cVDPV2 and 2 cVDPV2-positive environmental samples;
- Niger: 2 cVDPV2 cases;
- Horn of Africa (Somalia): 3 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) cases and 1 cVDPV3-positive environmental sample; and
- Papua New Guinea: 2 new cVDPV1 cases.

Afghanistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 14.
- 2 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Kandahar province, collected on [28 Aug 2018].

Pakistan
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 4.
- 5 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), collected in August and September [2018].

Nigeria
- 3 new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week, bringing the total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 to 11.
- These latest reported cases all had onset of paralysis in August [2018], from Katsina and Borno states, linked to the cVDPV2 outbreak centred around Jigawa.
- Additionally, 2 new cVDPV2-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Yobe state, collected on [7 and 18 Aug 2018].
- No new cases of WPV1 were reported. The most recently detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centered in Jigawa state and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2-containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus is detected.
- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad basin
- 2 cases of cVDPV2 are reported from Niger, genetically linked to a cVDPV2 in Jigawa, Nigeria. The 2 cases are from Zinder province, Niger, with dates of onset of paralysis on [18 Jul 2018 and 8 Aug 2018]. Nigeria is also affected by a separate cVDPV2, centred around Sokoto state.
- Since detection of the initial isolates in early 2018, outbreak response continues to be conducted across northern Nigeria. As the risk of potential international spread, in particular to Niger, is considered high, enhanced vaccination activities continue to be implemented in Niger. An outbreak response is now being planned, including with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2). The exact scale and extent of the response is being determined.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public-health authorities in conducting field investigation and risk assessment to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary. Active searches for additional AFP cases are continuing, and additional surveillance measures, such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals, is being expanded.
- The detection of WPV1 and cVDPV2 in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps in the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for a cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week.
- DRC is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2 in the provinces of Mongala, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the "Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication." The high-level meeting was convened by HE the minister of health, as well as the WHO director-general and the regional director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since cVDPV was first confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the GPEI will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- 3 new cases of cVDPV3 were reported in the past week, as well as 1 cVDPV3-positive environmental sample, from Lower Juba, Middle Shabelle, and Banadir, Somalia.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed-upon guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public-health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- 2 new cases of cVDPV1 were reported in the past week, bringing the total number of cases in 2018 to 14. These latest reported cases are from Jiwaka and Eastern Highlands provinces and had onset of paralysis on [13 Aug 2018 and 16 Jun 2018], respectively.
- It is important to note that detection and reporting of new cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened, and reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the commencement of comprehensive outbreak response.

Middle East
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset of paralysis) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on 21 Sep2017.

[Well, it seems as though the circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) are taking over in the past 2 years; there are more cases of paralytic disease globally due to cVDPVs than to wild polioviruses (WPVs). And the number of outbreaks and countries affected continue to grow. The identification of 2 cases of cVDPV2 in Niger that are genetically related to the outbreak of cVDPV occurring in Jigawa state, Nigeria, reminds me of the outbreaks of WPV1 in other African countries related to the cessation of vaccination activities in northern Nigeria back in 2003/2004 (see archive numbers below). Is history going to repeat itself now with cVDPVs? (In 2013, Niger reported a case of wild poliovirus related to a virus originating in Nigeria.)

In the past week, new cases of cVDPV have been identified in 4 countries: Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, and Papua New Guinea. And the total number of cVDPVs to date this year is greater than during the same period in 2017.

Note that the case of polio in Afghanistan reported in yesterday's (Wed 26 Sep 2018) ProMED-mail update has not been confirmed as yet through the WHO confirmation process.
