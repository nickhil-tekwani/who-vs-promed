http://www.khmertimeskh.com/news/13682/cambodia-reports-sharp-rise-in-dengue-fever-cases-in-1st-half-of-2015/


Cambodia has seen 2688 dengue fever cases in the 1st 6 months of 2015, an increase of 116 percent from the 1245 cases over the same period last year [2014], a health official said in a report on [Sat 25 Jul 2015].

"The incident rate is 16.6 cases out of 100 000 people," Huy Rekol, director of the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control, said in the report posted on the center's website.

He said the disease killed 10 children during the January-June [2015] period this year, one more than the death toll over the same period last year [2014].

Despite the sharp rise in cases, the fatal rate was comparable to last year [2014], which showed that Cambodian parents were well aware of dengue fever and sent their kids to hospitals in a timely manner when they suspected that their children had been infected with the disease, he added.

Rekol said over 71 percent of the patients were children aged between 5 and 14 years old.

Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The disease causes an acute illness of sudden onset that usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, vomiting and rash.

In Cambodia, the outbreak of the disease usually occurs in the rainy season from May to October.

[As dengue fever used to have a cyclical outbreak every 3 to 5 years in Cambodia, with the latest outbreak dated back in 2012, this increase in cases is a wake-up call for strengthening dengue prevention and control during the potential outbreak during the coming months with expected increased rainfall.

While all dengue serotypes were in circulation in Cambodia since 2002, it is worth noting that DEN-1 was most prevalent in 2013 (90.3 percent), 2014 (89.4 percent), and 2015 (91 percent) from 5 sentinel sites (http://www.cnm.gov.kh/userfiles/Dengue%20Report%20Week%2027_2015_RITHEA.pdf; in Khmer).
