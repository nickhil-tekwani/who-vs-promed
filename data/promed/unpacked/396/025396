The Calgary area accounted for 5 of 6 deaths reported so far in this year's [2018-19] flu season, according to information released by Alberta Health Services [AHS] this week.

The city's health zone has also been home to 1241 known cases of influenza A, or 63 per cent of the 1985 instances of illness in the province, says AHS.

By comparison, the Edmonton zone has seen no deaths and only 273 cases. One death has occurred in the province's north zone.

Dr Jia Hu, medical officer of health for the Calgary zone, said people who die of flu typically also have other illnesses.

"If we look at the number of deaths this year [2018] compared to the past few years, they are, broadly speaking, on par with what we've seen in previous seasons," Hu said. "What we have seen this year is just a really rapid increase in the number of cases in Calgary zone, but the number of flu cases across the province does tend to equalize by the end of the season."

Of flu hospitalizations, Calgary has counted 293, or 69 per cent of the cases.

Just 72 patients have been hospitalized in the Edmonton area.

In the previous flu season, 92 people died from flu-involved illness with 32 of those in the Calgary area.

For the current season, the province has made available enough vaccine to immunize 35 per cent of Alberta's population, 29 per cent of which was vaccinated last year [2017].

As of [24 Nov 2018], 998 842 doses of the influenza vaccine had been administered by AHS Public Health and pharmacists, including 413 152 in the Calgary region.

"We know that Calgary has seen a lot of flu cases thus far, so very important for folks to get immunized," Hu said. "It's available at public health clinics, doctor's offices, and pharmacies."

He also urged Calgarians to "practise good hand hygiene and to stay home if you're ill."

Influenza activity is increasing in the northern hemisphere as expected, and reports of fatal cases create public anxiety with overburdening of the health system. An important public health measure is to develop health information bulletins and messages to be disseminated through healthcare providers and facilities, ahead of the influenza season, and encourage vaccination, particularly in the high-risk groups. - Mod.UBA]
