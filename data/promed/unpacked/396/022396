[This is the official confirmation of the previous reports which add Switzerland to the list of affected countries (see references below). The disease outbreak involving 18 farms is widely spread geographically within Switzerland, even though there are only 33 positive cases. Getting a good picture of disease penetration and timing in Europe this year will be helpful in defining the epidemiology of Schmallenberg virus infection and factors influencing spread of the disease. It is an opportunity that will hopefully be pursued vigorously and such studies should include an economic impact assessment. - Mod.PC
