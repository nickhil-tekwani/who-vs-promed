The Ministry of Health has received information that 2 residents of Getashen rural community of Armavir Province were transferred to the capital city Yerevan infection hospital, and with boil-like wounds (cutaneous anthrax symptoms) on their fingers and wrists, the ministry informed.

The patients [reported] that a few days earlier, they had taken part in the skinning of the cow of a fellow villager, and the processing of the meat of this cow.

A total of 6 more fellow villagers were found with complaints characteristic of cutaneous anthrax. All were referred to the Yerevan infection hospital for clinical evaluation. The DNA of the causative agent of anthrax was detected in 5 of these patients.

Medical supervision has been set up in this rural community. Work is in progress to prevent the spread of this disease.

[Getashen, close to Armenia's border with Turkey (Igdir Province, Eastern Anatolia), is about 110 km (68 mi) west of the Armenian village Geghovit, Gegharkunik Province, where anthrax had been reported earlier in August 2019, affecting cattle with subsequent cutaneous human infections. The event was reported as resolved following revaccination of the entire village's cattle population. It would be helpful to note if small ruminants (sheep and goats) have been vaccinated as well.

House slaughter of animals, skirting veterinary meat inspection, might be a (too) common practice in Armenia.

For further background information on anthrax in Armenia, please refer to Mod.MHJ's commentary in 20190820.6632004 and 20190823.6635925. - Mod.AS
