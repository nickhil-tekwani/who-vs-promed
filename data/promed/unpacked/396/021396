At least 27 people in south Gujarat have lost their lives to leptospirosis,
a disease spread by rodents, in less than a week.
Officials said 177 victims of the disease from 131 villages are under
treatment. The disease has spread in Surat, Navasari and Valsad districts.
Surat Medical College has initiated various steps to contain the outbreak
and send medicines to affected villages.
Meanwhile, a mysterious fever has claimed 4 lives in 3 days in Borisana
village in Gandhinagar district, 60 km from here. As many as 150 patients
are suffering from the disease that is yet to be diagnosed by medical experts.
Medical teams from civil hospitals in the capital Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad
rushed to the village to collect blood samples and are carrying out the tests.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on this outbreak. It should
be noted that the information on this outbreak was at the bottom of a
newswire discussing an outbreak of leptospirosis in other districts of
Gujarat. Can one automatically assume that leptospirosis has been ruled
out as the etiology of this other outbreak? The newswire does not give
information on the clinical spectrum of disease of this second outbreak,
other than to mention fever, and to mention there have been 4 deaths in 3
days with approximately 150 cases. We await further information prior to
begin speculations. - Mod.MPP]
