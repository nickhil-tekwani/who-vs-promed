E. coli Suspected at Fox Bay Village
-----------------------------------------
On Mon 30 Jan 2006 morning, a military spokesman from Mount Pleasant
sent a message to say that there was an _E. coli_ outbreak at Fox Bay
Village. The 1st to be affected were residents of a house where
military re-fuelers were staying. After calling village residents,
there was a lack of knowledge about the problem, so the Chief Medical
Officer, Dr. Roger Diggle, was contacted, and he confirmed the
location of the suspect water source and probable cause of the outbreak.
Instructions about boiling water and using water purification tablets
were issued for the village. According to former Councilor Norma
Edwards, Fox Bay West was not affected by the outbreak, as they have
another water source.

[The size of the outbreak is not stated. Additionally, the posting
did not state whether the organism was identified as _E. coli_
O157:H7. Finding _E. coli_ or other coliforms in a water supply is
evidence that the water is contaminated but not necessarily that the
cause of any symptoms is bacterial. - Mod.LL]
[More information on the etiology of this outbreak would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
