[American foulbrood (AFB) is an infectious disease of the larval stage of the honey bee _Apis mellifera_ and other _Apis_ spp., and occurs throughout the world where such bees are kept. _Paenibacillus larvae_, the causative organism, is a Gram positive bacterium that can produce over one billion spores in each infected larva. The bacterium is a round-ended, straight and sometimes curved rod, which varies greatly in size (0.5 microns wide by 1.5 to 6 microns long), occurring singly and in chains and filaments; some strains are motile. The sporangia are often sparse in vitro, and the ellipsoidal, central to subterminal spores, which may swell the sporangia, are often found free. The spores are extremely heat stable and resistant to chemical agents. Only spores are capable of inducing the disease.

For more information, please see the OIE terrestrial manual, Chapter 2.2.2 on AFB at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.02.02_AMERICAN_FOULBROOD.pdf.

The characteristic disease signs of AFB include some or all of the following: 1. Uneven or 'pepper-pot' brood pattern; 2. Sunken, greasy or perforated, darkened cell capping; 3. Roping, sticky larval remains when drawn out with a matchstick; 4. Dark "scales", which are difficult to remove from cells (https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/beebase/index.cfm?pageid=159).

The caps of cells containing diseased larvae or pupae may be sunken, concave, dark, and at times greasy-looking. Some caps may be perforated and other caps may be totally removed, exposing the diseased individual. Some pictures of symptoms can be found at http://www.dpi.vic.gov.au/agriculture/pests-diseases-and-weeds/animal-diseases/bees/diagnosis-of-americal-foulbrood-disease-of-honey-bee-brood.

The most common method of transmission from infected hive to healthy hive is the beekeeper. The spores can easily transferred, if frames of honey or brood are moved between hives, or if other contaminated equipment is used. However, robbing by adult bees of dead or dying infected colonies is also an important mode of transmission. If left to run its course, all colonies infected with AFB will eventually die from the disease (https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/beebase/index.cfm?pageid=159).

OIE's internationally agreed requirements pertaining to Infection of honey bees with _Paenibacillus larvae_ (American foulbrood) are spelled out in chapter 9.2. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.9.2.htm.

Previous to this latest report, Belgium reported on 24 Jul 2013 one outbreak of AFB in the Brabant region (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13802). The event was resolved on 13 Aug 2013.

According to the most recent 6-monthly OIE report, AFB was reported as present in 49 countries, of which 30 are European countries (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist).
