The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [27 Jun 2013] that tularemia cases are on the increase in several locations around New Mexico. Since the middle of April 2013, there have been 4 cases in people and 6 cases in dogs and cats. The human cases include a 45-year-old man from Santa Fe County, an 88-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 62-year-old woman from Santa Fe County, and a 75-year-old woman from San Juan County. 3 of the human cases were hospitalized and all have recovered and gone home. Onset of illness in the most recent case was 15 Jun 2013. The pet cases include 2 cats and a dog from Santa Fe County, a dog from Sandoval County, a dog from Los Alamos County, and a cat from Torrance County. They have all recovered.

"I would encourage people in the mentioned counties and around the state to follow the same precautions they would to avoid plague," said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. "Don't handle sick or dead rodents, don't allow pets to roam and hunt, get an appropriate tick and flea control product for pets, and take sick pets to a veterinarian. Since tularemia can be fatal in a small percentage of cases, it should be treated with antibiotics following an evaluation by a physician."

Tularemia is a potentially serious illness in people that occurs naturally in the USA. It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits, and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick. Symptoms of tularemia in people usually develop 3 to 5 days after exposure but onset can vary from 1 to 14 days. Tularemia symptoms are similar to plague infection including sudden fever, chills, headaches, diarrhea, muscles aches, and joint pain. Other symptoms of tularemia depend on how a person was exposed to the tularemia bacteria and can include pneumonia and chest pain, ulcers on the skin or mouth, swollen and painful lymph glands, swollen and painful eyes, and a sore throat.

"The recent human cases in New Mexico had various exposures to tularemia, including skinning a rabbit with bare hands, receiving a bite from a sick cat, cleaning out a water trough with a dead rabbit in it, and being bitten by a deer fly or a tick on the lower leg," said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. "Oftentimes there is a rabbit or rodent die-off in an area due to tularemia and deer flies or ticks can become infected from these animals and then pass it on to pets or people when they bite them."

People can get tularemia in different ways: handling infected animal carcasses; being bitten by an infected tick, deerfly or other insect; eating or drinking contaminated food or water or by breathing in the bacteria. Dogs and cats are usually exposed to tularemia when they are allowed to roam and hunt sick rodents and rabbits or when bitten by an infected tick.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ettestad for this communication.

The state of New Mexico can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/2o_v. The counties mentioned can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/new-mexico.shtml.

Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that is occasionally seen in dogs. It is caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. It is associated with multiple animal species, including humans, and can be acquired from through contact with infected animals, infected wounds or soil. It is also commonly know as rabbit fever for its mode of transmission, even while it can infect several types of animals and be transmitted via any infected animal, as such, the bacteria can also be acquired by ingestion of contaminated water, or through contact with infected soil, where the organism can remain in an infectious state for up to several months.

Infection is often caused by ingestion of an infected mammals' tissue, such as when a dog/cat hunts a small animal, bird or reptile, through water, or by tick, mite, flea or mosquito bite -- all of which can carry and transmit the bacteria. The bacterium may also infect a cat or dog through its skin, or by entering its airways, eyes, or gastrointestinal system.

Clinical signs seen in domestic pets include: sudden onset of fever, lethargy, dehydration, lack of appetite (anorexia), enlargement of the lymph nodes, tender abdomen, enlargement of spleen or liver, white patches or ulcers on the tongue, and jaundice which may be indicated by yellow eyes.

Rabbits and other wild rodents are the primary species affected. Tularemia can also affect beaver and muskrats. Livestock and pets including pigs, horses, dogs, cats, fish and birds can also get tularemia. Sheep are especially susceptible. Cattle rarely get the disease.

Tularemia is difficult to prevent since it can be in the environment or be spread by insects. Prevention measures include keeping pets indoors and away from wildlife. Do not feed animals raw meat, especially that from wild animals. Control ticks and biting flies.

[_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness, but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3 to 5 days, with a range of one to 14 days.

The clinical presentation of tularemia depends on the route of exposure. Airborne _F. tularensis_ would mainly cause pleuropneumonitis. Exposures that penetrate broken skin result in ulceroglandular or glandular disease. The onset of tularemia is usually abrupt, with fever, headache, chills and rigors, generalized body aches (often prominent in the low back), coryza, and sore throat. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea may occur. Sweats, fever, chills, progressive weakness, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss characterize the continuing illness. - Mod.LL]
