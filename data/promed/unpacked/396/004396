[A] disease issue being tackled is an onion rot, which starts at the top of the bulb. Eric Feibert, Malheur Experiment Station [Oregon State University] said the source of the problem is not known. Also unknown is when the rot starts to happen. The rot prevents onions from being fully developed. The disease can develop in the field or in storage.

Feibert is leading research on 2 varieties of onions and said those onions are checked on a weekly basis to try and see when the disease shows up. In another trial some [of] the research is focusing on whether heat may be a cause or partly a cause of the rot.

[It appears that a causal pathogen of the rot may not have been diagnosed as yet. Identification of a potential infectious pathogen would be essential before being able to assess whether external factors, such as heat mentioned above, may favour disease development.
