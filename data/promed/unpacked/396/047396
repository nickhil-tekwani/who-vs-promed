[Ref: Nazari K, et al.: First Report of Ug99 Race TTKTT of Wheat Stem Rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) in Iraq. Plant Disease, online. 2021; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-02-21-0404-PDN].

Abstract [summarized]
--------------------
A wheat survey was conducted in Iraq in 2019 and collected 27 stem rust samples. Seven samples were viable and were tested for races of _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_.

Spores were inoculated onto 20 North American stem rust differential lines. Out of the 7 samples, 4 were typed as TKKTF, 2 as TKTTF, one collected from an advanced breeding bread wheat line "Shahoo 2" showed mixed [infection types on seedling lines] carrying Sr11, Sr24, Sr36, and Sr31 [resistance genes]. All seedling assays were repeated 3 times. The 3 isolates virulent on Sr31 were designated as race TTKTT, and the isolate virulent on Sr11 was designated as TKTTF. Race TKTTF was similar to TKKTF except for additional virulence on Sr36, and TTKTT differed from the other 2 races being virulent on Sr24 and Sr31.

DNA analysis of 3 TTKTT isolates from Kenya and the TTKTT isolate from Iraq using a diagnostic qPCR assay confirmed that all tested isolates belonged to the Ug99 lineage. Race TTKTT was first reported from Kenya in 2014 and in 2018 from Ethiopia. We report the 1st detection of TTKTT in Iraq and the Middle East region. This represents the 3rd instance of a member of the Ug99 race group outside of Africa since first detection of TTKSK in Yemen in 2006 [ProMED post 20070117.0229] and Iran in 2007 [ProMED post 20080307.0925].

The continued spread of stem rust races with complex virulence, and the increasing frequency and early onset of stem rust infections in the Middle East is a cause for concern. Continuous support for rust surveillance and race typing in this region remains crucial.

[Wheat stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_, previously f.sp. _tritici_) has been reported to cause overall yield losses of up to 80%, but some fields are totally destroyed. Barley is also susceptible to this pathogen. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw or other contaminated materials. The fungus can survive between seasons on some grasses or volunteer wheat generating a "green bridge." Alternatively, it can also produce hardy teliospores to infect members of the genus _Berberis_ (barberries) in the next season, which then serve as a source of crop inoculum. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat, and resistant varieties, if available.

Races with increased virulence are emerging frequently; resistance breeding programmes have been set up by several countries and international groups. One of the most serious threats at present is considered to be the Ug99 family of strains (first discovered in Uganda in 1999), which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. The orignal Ug99 is also referred to as TTKSK. Additional resistance genes have been overcome by subsequent variants, with 11 additional races currently recognised in the Ug99 lineage (see link below). All show identical DNA fingerprints but differ in virulence patterns. Additional host resistance genes (including Sr24, Sr36, SrTmp) have now been overcome by Ug99 group variants.

New strains not related to Ug99 are also posing a danger and are currently being considered the cause of a re-emerging stem rust threat in Europe. For example, the Digalu strain with 2 distinct genotypes is spreading in Europe and present in the UK (ProMED post 20180219.5638265); variants with virulence to 4 additional host resistance genes have been identified in this group.
