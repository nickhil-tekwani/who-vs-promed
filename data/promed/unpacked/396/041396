Chilean authorities detected in less than 2 weeks a 2nd turkey farm affected by avian influenza [AI] in Valparaiso region, where 35 000 birds will be eliminated, reported the Agricultural and Animal Breeding Service (SAG, according to its Spanish initials).

The farm, which is located in El Melon community (100 km west from Santiago), belongs to the Agrosuper company, the same company reporting on 4 Jan 2017 the 1st outbreak of avian influenza in another facility located in Quilpu√©, a neighboring community, where SAG activated a campaign in order to prevent the virus from disseminating.

Personnel from SAG took samples from the turkeys from this farm that developed respiratory signs. The results of the performed tests confirmed the presence of H7 type avian influenza.

After the 1st case was confirmed, in which 350 000 turkeys were eliminated, Bolivia, Peru, and Uruguay suspended importing turkeys from Chile.

Although avian influenza is an exotic disease that is significant to poultry health and breeding, this condition does not represent a risk for humans.

[This is likely a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza.

"AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity, the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock.

Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness (https://goo.gl/nzis8z).

"Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

A facility having been diagnosed with this virus needs a thorough cleaning and disinfecting. Proper and thorough cleaning and disinfecting starts with removal of organic material such as litter and bedding. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents." - Mods.TG/CRD
