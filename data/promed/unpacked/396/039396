2nd Japanese Encephalitis Case in the Hong Kong S.A.R. Confirmed
--------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection has confirmed Japanese encephalitis virus
infection in a 45-year-old Yuen Long man. It is the 2nd case reported in
2004. A hotline (2575 1848) has been set up to offer health advice and
arrange follow-up action for symptomatic people in the vicinity of Palm
Springs, where the sick man lived. He developed fever, headache and
drowsiness on 8 Jun 2004 and was admitted to Pamela Youde Nethersole
Eastern District Hospital. He is now in critical condition. A neighbourhood
survey is being conducted for active case finding and blood tests for signs
of infection. The Centre for Health Protection will hold a health talk for
residents tomorrow. Blood tests will be offered.
Centre Consultant Dr Thomas Tsang said the case is not related to the first
one involving a foreign domestic helper in Kau Wa Keng San Tsuen, Kwai
Chung. He did not rule out the possibility of sporadic cases, but said the
chances of an outbreak are slim. Dr Tsang said 518 people from 269 families
have been contacted in the Kwai Chung investigation. No one has contracted
the disease.
Dr Tsang said 9 viral encephalitis reports have been received since the
Centre, the Hospital Authority and the private medical sector established
an alert system on 11 Jun 2004 to monitor the occurrence of viral
encephalitis cases. He said the number is similar to past trends and is
within an acceptable range. Investigations into the cases are continuing.
Food & Environmental Hygiene Department Consultant Dr Ho Yuk-yin said
anti-mosquito work in the area and around nearby piggeries has been stepped
up, and larvicides have been applied to control breeding. He said _Culex
tritaeniorhychus_, the key vector of Japanese encephalitis virus, is found
in Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, North District, Kwai Chung, Sha Tin and Ma On Shan.
These mosquitoes breed where there is abundant water, such as fields, and
become infected by biting pigs and wild birds which have the virus. The
infected mosquito can then transmit the virus to humans and animals through
a bite. Anti-mosquito work around Palm Springs, including nearby abandoned
fields and dense vegetation, will be strengthened.
Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department Senior Veterinary Officer
Dr Howard Wong said there are 3 pig farms located within 2 kilometres of
the patient's residence. Routine mosquito mitigation measures have been
carried out for farms, and inspections over the last 2 weeks have found
neither sick pigs nor mosquito breeding grounds. Dr Wong said visits to all
pig farms and mosquito surveillance will be stepped up in the coming 2
weeks to guard against mosquito breeding.

[This report confirms the diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis virus
infection described in the preceding post in this thread. The continuing
investigation of this case and the earlier fatal case further supports the
conclusion that the cases are unrelated and represent independent sporadic
infections. There has been no onward transmission of infection in either
case. - Mod.CP]
