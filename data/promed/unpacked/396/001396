A 74 year old man from Avila, Spain has died from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). He had been taking part in a hunting activity near the Badajoz town of Helechosa de los Montes, Spain.

In Spain, CCHFV was first detected in hyalomma ticks from Caceres in 2010 and again in 2014 (Estrada-Pena et al, 2012; Cajimat et al, 2017). Subsequently, 2 autochthonous CCHFV cases were reported in August 2016, which resulted in the death of a 62 year old man that in turn resulted in a nosocomial transmission to a 52 year old nurse who was part of the patient's care team (Negredo et al, 2017).

Because the hyalomma tick populations are widely distributed in the Mediterranean basin (Pena Estrada et al, 2004), surveillance for the presence of CCHFV in western Europe is of utmost importance, and these additional cases of CCHFV highlight the growing threat of this disease to the European continent.

A 74 year old man died in Avila from Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) after participating in a hunting activity in July [2018] in the town of Helechosa de los Montes (Badajoz), where he suffered a tick bite, according to reports from this Thursday's [9 Aug 2018] sources at the Ministry of Health of Castile and Leon. The National Center of Microbiology of the Carlos III Health Institute has confirmed CCHF infection of the affected person, who died yesterday [8 Aug 2018] at the Welfare Complex of Avila.

The patient's infection caused a high fever and clinical picture that was fatal. The epidemiology services of the Castile and Leon government, in collaboration with the welfare complex of Avila, are working to identify the possible contacts of the deceased man and indicate the follow-up that must be carried out.

Health authorities in the Extremadura region have already taken measures to inform the population and health professionals to avoid possible infections. In cases where there has been close contact, the body temperature of patients should be periodically monitored and the reference epidemiologist informed of any change in their health status, notes the statement from health officials, who assure that the epidemiology services of both autonomous communities are in constant contact.

CCHF is caused by a virus that is primarily transmitted by ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, although it can also be contracted by contact with blood or fluids of an infected patient, like transmission of other more common diseases such as hepatitis B.

In 2016, the first 2 cases of this disease were confirmed in Spain: a 62 year old man who died 25 Aug [2016] after a tick bite on a walk through the countryside near a town in Avila province, and the nurse who attended him during his hospital admission, after coming in contact with his fluids.

To prevent tick bites, the health authorities, which in recent weeks have carried out an information campaign, emphasize the importance of wearing appropriate clothing and shoes during field trips. They have also recommended walking along roads and using repellents for people and pets, in addition to removing any ticks as soon as possible and in an appropriate manner, preferably by health professionals.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is widespread geographically and has been identified in more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. In Europe, CCHF has previously been reported only in countries located in the south eastern part of the continent: Russia, Georgia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Albania, Kosovo, Greece, and Turkey.

CCHF virus, like other tickborne pathogens, circulates silently in a cattle-tick cycle. Outbreaks occur when a range of factors related to tick, vertebrate host, and human behavior align, increasing the level of viral circulation, the interactions between humans and sources of infection, or both.

Negredo and colleagues reported 2 cases of autochthonous CCHF in Avila Spain [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1615162]. These cases were first reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in August 2016. The ECDC assessment report concluded, "Recent detection of CCHF virus in ticks from Extremadura in western Spain indicates the circulation of CCHF virus among wildlife. Therefore, the occurrence of CCHF virus infection is not an unexpected event in Spain. Nosocomial transmission of CCHF can occur even in a non-endemic region when appropriate infection prevention and control measures have not been observed. The probability of CCHF virus infection in Spain is low. However, other sporadic cases are possible. The risk of further human-to-human transmission in hospital settings can be significantly reduced by applying timely appropriate infection prevention and control measures" [https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/new-rapid-risk-assessment-crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever-spain].

The fatal case from the above report is also from the same part of Spain and indicates that the virus circulation cycle is in place. The circumstances for exposure of the event indicate random contact with an infected animal in the wild, but the case merits further investigation and implementation of infection control measures for contacts and healthcare workers. - Mod.UBA
