Abstract
--------
Background: Epidemics of sexually transmitted infections (STI) are a major public health challenge in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region.

Aim: We aimed to provide an overview of case reporting and other surveillance data for syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia for the non-European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) countries of the Centre and East part of the WHO European Region as per classification used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe (WHO/Europe) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Methods: Data were provided by the surveillance agencies of the Member States for the period 2015 to 2019 through the WHO/Europe Communicable Diseases Annual Reporting Form. We analysed reported cases, explored data reported to the WHO Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (GASP) and performed a review of publications on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in gonorrhoea in the period 2015 to 2020 using systematic methodology.

Results: From 2015 to 2019, in most of the countries with 3 or more data points, there was a pattern of decrease in reported syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia cases, which is in contrast to the EU/EEA. The number of reported cases per 100 000 population was 0.4-26.5 for syphilis, 0-18.5 for gonorrhoea and 0-43.3 for chlamydia. Four countries reported recent data on AMR in gonorrhoea to GASP, and we identified further publications from Georgia, Russia and Ukraine.

Conclusion: We found wide heterogeneity in reported rates of STI. There is a strong need to improve availability and quality of STI surveillance data in the non-EU/EEA countries.

Conclusion
----------
Among the key findings of this analysis is a still rather limited availability of STI data, including AMR data in gonorrhoea, in tools that the WHO uses for STI data collection and reporting such as CDJRF [Europe Communicable Diseases Joint Reporting Form], GAM [Global AIDS Monitoring] and GASP. Moving forward, STI surveillance systems and laboratory diagnostics need to be further strengthened so as to better estimate the burden of STI, measure progress towards the STI control targets set by the WHO and guide the implementation of national STI control programmes. Specific to the European Region is the importance of availability of STI trend data in key populations, in particular in MSM [men who have sex with men] in the context of pre-exposure prophylaxis for prevention of HIV transmission and decreased condom use.

[The 18 non-EU/EEA countries include Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kazakhstan, North Macedonia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Montenegro, Serbia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Russia, Ukraine and Uzbekistan, plus Kosovo.

For 2015 to 2018, only 4 non-EU/EEA countries reported gonococcal AMR and susceptibility testing data for at least one drug, namely, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Ukraine, but AMR data for more than 100 gonococcal isolates in a year was available only from Russia in 2015 and 2016.
