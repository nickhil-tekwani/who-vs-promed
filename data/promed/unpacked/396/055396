An outbreak of a dangerous cattle disease has been recorded in the
village of Pyvovarikha, near Irkutsk. Veterinarians cannot manage the
epidemic, and there has been no official comment on the situation.
Local inhabitants are close to panic. A security guard of a
cattle-breeding facility sharply reacted to the presence of
television cameras and did not wish to answer questions.
In the meantime, now during the 2nd week of the outbreak, massive
losses of cattle have been registered. Carcasses of animals are being
burnt at the facility. Access is strictly prohibited. Motor vehicle
entry is only authorized under the personal order of the director,
even for ambulances. The state facility belongs to the Irkutsk
Scientific Research Institute of Agriculture.
From 20-30 Dec 2007, cattle started to become ill. The virus affected
the lungs of the animals. There was a suspicion of pasteurellosis;
lately, experts from Moscow have confirmed this disease. But the
methods of treatment recommended in such cases appeared to be
ineffective. The infection quickly spread, and an epidemic began.
Boris Bolyberdin, head veterinary inspector of the Irkutsk area, said
that "from Moscow, we have received confirmation that it is
respiratory-syncytial infection."
53 calves have been los, 124 adult animals have been slaughtered.
Now medication [vaccine?] against the disease has been brought to the
region from Krasnodar kray. But over the past day, 5 more cows have
been lost. Rumors have been spreading through the village of
Pivovarikha, where the farm is located, that people have also started
to become ill. Veterinarians deny this.
Bolyberdin said that "it [the infection in humans?] is a household
infection, and those diseases which have been found [in cattle?] can
cause infection only in animals and only in cattle. They don't affect
humans."
Employees of the Ministry of Emergency Measures, Rosselkhoznadzor
(Federal Agency for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision) are
working on the problem. Help from experts and virologists from other
regions of the country [has been] requested.

An unknown virus has killed cattle in the Irkutsk region. An epidemic
in cattle has been recorded in the village of Pyvovarikha, several km
from Irkutsk.
Local residents have been forced to slaughter cattle, stated RIA
Novosti, [quoting] the Department of Propagation of the Central
Administrative Board of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Measures in
the Irkutsk region.
In total, by 3 Jan 2008 in Pyvovarikha, there were 582 sick animals,
of which 124 were slaughtered. It is conjectured that the disease
is caused by a virus transmitted by air, an employee of the
Department of Propagation reported.
As he stated, the epidemic has affected a facility of the Irkutsk
Scientific Research Institute of Agriculture. This year [2007], the
facility bought breeding cows from Canada for cultivation of the herd.
The reasons for the disease will be reported when preliminary expert
examination of the samples taken from ill and dead animals is
completed.
The pilot farm of the Scientific Research Institute of Agriculture is
engaged in preparation of seeds for facilities of the Irkutsk
region and cultivation of the breeding herd. An "Extreme Situation"
alert has been recorded for Pyvovarikha. There have been no official
reports of cases of disease among humans.
