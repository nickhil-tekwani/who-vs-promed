A confirmed case of measles prompted Contra Costa County public health officials on Wed [22 Aug 2018] to warn residents and visitors they may have been exposed to the highly contagious airborne illness [see URL above for location of possible exposure]. The infected person visited several popular indoor venues in Contra Costa County, Los Angeles County, and Arizona, and officials in the latter areas have issued their own advisories.

A statement issued Monday [20 Aug 2018] by the Los Angeles County Public Health Department warned people in Santa Monica that they might have been exposed to an infected tourist at 6 sites between 8 and 10 Aug [2018]. Privacy laws prevent health officials from releasing identifying information about the person who contracted measles, said Paul Leung, communicable disease program chief for the Contra Costa Department of Public Health.

Leung said the patient, who did not know whether he or she had been vaccinated, has recovered and is no longer contagious. Health officials advised anyone who may have been exposed to the patient or develops a high fever and rash to contact their doctor immediately. [...]

"Most people have been vaccinated and therefore are protected and not at risk, even if they have shared the same indoor air-space with a contagious person," said Dr. Chris Farnitano, Contra Costa County's chief health officer. "However, residents should be aware of the situation, because anyone who was exposed and not protected by vaccine is at risk of developing measles."

Contra Costa County's last reported case of measles was in 2014, Leung said, but 6 cases were reported earlier this year in Santa Clara County.

[The CDC also posted an alert on Epi-X (Epidemic Information Exchange, a secure web-based network that serves as an information exchange): The California Department of Public Health and The Arizona Department of Health Services are investigating exposures related to a laboratory-confirmed measles case with rash onset on 10 Aug 2018. Persons may have been exposed at multiple California and Arizona venues between 6 and 14 Aug 2018.

This serves as a reminder that even though the USA is considered free of measles, i.e., no endemic transmission except through introduced cases, measles can be brought into the country by tourists and following travel by citizens to regions where there still are a high number of measles cases. According to the WHO, measles cases have reached a record high in Europe this year [2018], with more cases recorded in the first 6 months of 2018 than any other 12-month period this decade. Therefore, parents must maintain vaccination of their children. - Mod.LK]

Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 33 of 2018, a total of 5004 confirmed measles cases, including 68 deaths, were reported in 11 countries in the Americas: Antigua and Barbuda (one case), Argentina (8 cases), Brazil (1237 cases, including 6 deaths), Canada (19 cases), Colombia (60 cases), Ecuador (17 cases), Guatemala (one case), Mexico (5 cases), Peru (4 cases), the USA (107 cases), and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (3545 cases, including 62 deaths). The following is a summary of the current outbreaks in the Americas:

Advice to national authorities

- Vaccinate to maintain homogeneous coverage of 95 percent with the 1st and 2nd doses of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities;
- Vaccinate at-risk populations (without proof of vaccination or immunity against measles and rubella), such as healthcare workers, people working in tourism and transportation (hotels and catering, airports, taxi drivers, and others) and international travelers;
- Maintain a reserve of measles-rubella (MR) vaccines and syringes for control of imported cases in each country of the region;
- Strengthen epidemiological surveillance of measles to achieve timely detection of all suspected cases of measles in public and private healthcare facilities and ensure that samples are received by laboratories within 5 days of being taken;
- Provide a rapid response to imported measles cases through the activation of rapid-response teams to avoid the re-establishment of endemic transmission. Once a rapid-response team has been activated, continued coordination between the national and local levels must be ensured, with permanent and fluid communication channels between all levels (national, sub-national, and local);
- Identify migratory flows from abroad (arrival of foreign persons) and internal flows (movements of population groups) in each country to facilitate access to vaccination services, according to the national scheme;
- Increase vaccination coverage and strengthen epidemiological surveillance in border areas in order to increase population immunity and rapidly detect/respond to suspected measles cases;
- During outbreak, establish adequate intra-hospital cases management to avoid nosocomial transmission, with an adequate flow of patients to isolation rooms (avoiding contact with other patients in waiting rooms and/or hospitalization settings.

Additionally, PAHO/WHO recommends that member states advise that all travelers aged 6 months and older who cannot show proof of vaccination or immunity receive the measles and rubella vaccine, preferably the triple viral vaccine (measles, mumps and rubella - MMR), at least 2 weeks before traveling to areas where measles transmission has been documented. The recommendations of PAHO/WHO in relation to advice for travelers are available in the 27 Oct 2017 PAHO/ WHO Epidemiological Update on Measles (Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization. Epidemiological Update: Measles. 27 October 2017, Washington, D.C.: PAHO/WHO; 2017. Available at: https://bit.ly/2I3gCSi).

[This is a comprehensive and excellent summary of measles cases in the Americas. See the URL for figures showing cases over time in each region. The points under advice are critical to protect communities against measles.

Measles in the indigenous communities in Brazil and Venezuela is particularly distressing. The PAHO report states that between EW 11 and EW 27 of 2018, there were 126 confirmed cases reported (by laboratory and/or epidemiological link), including 53 deaths, in the Yanomami. That is a 42 percent mortality rate.

Excerpted from https://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/yanomami:
"The Yanomami are the largest relatively isolated tribe in South America. They live in the rainforests and mountains of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela. Thousands of gold miners are now working illegally on Yanomami land, transmitting deadly diseases like malaria ..." [and other diseases, likely measles].

"Yanomami health is suffering, and critical medical care is not reaching them, especially in Venezuela." This is a dire situation. - Mod.LK
