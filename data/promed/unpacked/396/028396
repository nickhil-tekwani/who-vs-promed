Re: Swan deaths - UK (Lancashire)
---------------------------------------
In response to this ProMED posting and the questions raised on
possible viral causes for these swan deaths, several mute swans
(_Cygnus olor_) from this incident were submitted to the local VLA
(Veterinary Laboratories Agency) Regional Laboratory. The birds
received diagnostic examinations under the Diseases of Wildlife
Scheme. Several virology tests have been undertaken by the Avian
Virology Unit at VLA Weybridge (a OIE/FAO/EU Avian Influenza
Reference Laboratory).
Avian Influenza Virus (AIV) has not been detected by real time RT-PCR
(both in tests for influenza A virus and H5 subtype). Neither AI
viruses nor Newcastle Disease virus have been isolated following 2
passages in embryonated fowl's eggs (a final passage is in progress).
A consistent necropsy finding in these swans was a necrotizing
enteritis (particularly focused on the duodenum). Further virology,
bacteriology, biochemistry and other laboratory examinations are in
progress to find a cause.

[We are very grateful to Drs. Duff and Brown for this expedient,
firsthand response; exclusion of the 2 highly infectious diseases is
indeed good news.
If infectious diseases are still considered, one probably included in
the differential diagnosis is duck virus enteritis (DVE) or duck
plague -- an acute contagious infection of ducks, geese and swans
caused by a herpesvirus -- which is present in the UK.
Further findings, when available, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
