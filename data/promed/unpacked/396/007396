Melioidosis in Children, Brazil, 1989-2019
------------------------------------------
Melioidosis, an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_, is associated with severe symptoms and high death rates (1). Although considered an emerging disease, melioidosis has little formal public health recognition (2). Researchers initially documented cases in Brazil in 2003 (3). As of 2018, Ceara, a coastal state in northeastern Brazil, has the highest incidence in South America; however, sporadic cases have been reported in other states (4). Although the disease predominantly affects adults with associated risk factors (1), the growing incidence of severe melioidosis among children and adolescents in Ceara highlights the need for clinical and epidemiologic investigations.

The Study
---------
We analyzed all cases of melioidosis in persons under 18 years of age documented by the Ceara State Health Department during [January 2005-May 2019]. This state declared melioidosis a notifiable disease in 2005 (5), although the literature records cases from early as 1989 (6). We also searched for cases in the SciELO and PubMed databases using the terms "melioidosis" AND "Brazil" OR "children" published during [March 2003-May 2019]. We also searched the annals of Brazilian Congresses of Pediatric Infectiology from [2003-2018]. In total, we identified 16 cases in the health department database (1 case was excluded because of an alternative diagnosis) and 5 in the literature (3,6). All cases were either suspected or confirmed (Table 1 [for Tables, see original URL - Mod.LL]) (5,7).

We investigated cases using data from patient records and, when possible, from interviews with the patients and their relatives. We analyzed data on age, sex, time of symptom onset, geographic location, occupational or recreational activity involving water or soil during the 2 weeks before symptom onset, underlying conditions, signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiographic findings, clinical evolution, treatment, and clinical outcome. We used the Fisher exact test to assess the correlation between appropriate treatment using carbapenem or ceftazidime during the intensive phase of melioidosis (8) and survival. The study protocol was previously approved by the research ethics committees of the University of Fortaleza (Fortaleza, Brazil) (approval no. 3 094 492) and Albert Sabin Children's Hospital (Fortaleza) (approval no. 3,194 070).

We identified 10 confirmed (including 5 before 2005: 4 in 2003, and 1 identified retrospectively in 1989) (3,6), and 10 suspected cases of melioidosis among children and adolescents. The 10 confirmed cases in persons under 18 years of age account for 23.2% of the 43 confirmed cases of melioidosis in the state of Ceara as of [May 2019]. This proportion is substantially greater than the 5%-15% usually reported for children (9).

Most (9/20; 45%) patients were 10-17 years of age. The median age was 11 years for patients with confirmed cases and 9 years for those with suspected cases. For comparison, childhood melioidosis is most prevalent in children under 5 years of age in Malaysia (10) and in children over 10 years of age in Australia (11).

As in previous studies (2,12), most (13/20; 65%) patients in this sample were male. Illnesses occurred most frequently during the rainy season (i.e. February-May), accounting for 65% (13/20) of all cases and 70% (7/10) of confirmed cases. This trend resembles the results of a study in Australia (11) and reinforces the association between heavy rainfalls and exposure to _B. pseudomallei_. Most (19/20; 95%) patients had environmental exposure during the 14 days before symptom onset (Table 2). Outdoor recreational behavior is common among children in Brazil, especially in the tropics. For example, when intense warm showers interrupt the extended droughts of northeastern Brazil, children often bathe and play in waterfalls, rivers, and dams. This might partially account for the high prevalence of melioidosis among children, especially older children and boys, in this region.

The most frequent clinical manifestations were sepsis (18/20; 90%), pneumonia (18/20; 90%), and septic shock (17/20; 85%) (Table 2). Among confirmed cases, 90% (9/10) of patients had sepsis and pneumonia and 80% (8/10) had septic shock. Among suspected cases, 90% (9/10) of patients had pneumonia, sepsis, and septic shock. Studies in Malaysia have reported similar figures (10); however, the main manifestations among children are skin lesions in Australia and infectious parotitis in Cambodia (13,14). Although the methods used by these studies differ, they suggest that children in Ceara might have more severe clinical manifestations of melioidosis.

A total of 2 patients had meningitis, accounting for 20% (2/10) of confirmed cases and 10% (2/20) of total cases; however, a study in Australia observed neuromelioidosis in 3% of pediatric patients (15). These findings might indicate either a greater proportion of neurologic involvement or substantial underreporting of less severe manifestations among children with melioidosis in Brazil.

In total, 45% (9/20) of patients died: 60% (6/10) of patients with confirmed cases and 30% (3/10) of those with suspected cases. Childhood melioidosis is associated with a death rate of 35% globally (9), although in Australia the rate is reported to be 7% (13). In Cambodia, 16.4% of patients die, including up to 71% of patients with bacteremia (14). Our findings, which include high prevalence of sepsis and septic shock, 2 cases of severe neurologic involvement, and high death rates, warrant further investigation.

We found that appropriate, timely treatment for melioidosis (8) was significantly associated with survival among 20 patients (p under 0.01). Thus, physicians should consider empirical treatment for suspected melioidosis in patients in areas to which the disease is endemic, especially if the initial treatment was unsuccessful. We did not find a significant association between proper treatment and survival among patients with confirmed (p = 0.08) and suspected cases (p = 0.07) of melioidosis, possibly because of small sample size.

Conclusion
----------
We describe a high prevalence, death rate, and severity of childhood melioidosis in Brazil. The high death rate and clinical severity might be partially explained by underreporting of mild cases, but the frequent environmental exposures of children in this region warrant further research. These findings emphasize the need for melioidosis awareness among healthcare providers and laboratory professionals. Physicians should consider melioidosis as a differential diagnosis; improved awareness might reduce underreporting and optimize the quality of epidemiologic data. Physicians also should consider empirical treatment in patients who have clinical manifestations compatible with the disease and whose prognosis is compromised by clinical severity.

[Melioidosis is a disease of the rainy season in its endemic areas. It mainly affects people who have direct contact with soil and water. Many have an underlying predisposing condition, such as diabetes (most common risk factor), renal disease, cirrhosis, thalassemia, alcohol dependence, immunosuppressive therapy, chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, and excess kava consumption (kava is an herbal member of the pepper family that can be associated with chronic liver disease).

Melioidosis may present at any age but tends to peak in the 4th and 5th decades of life, affecting men more than women. In addition, although severe fulminating infection can and does occur in healthy individuals, severe disease and fatalities are much less common in those without risk factors.

Classically, the most commonly recognized presentation of melioidosis is pneumonia, associated with high fever, significant muscle aches, and chest pain, and -- although the cough can be nonproductive -- respiratory secretions can be purulent, significant in quantity, and associated with on-and-off bright red blood. The lung infection can be rapidly fatal -- with bacteremia and shock -- or somewhat more indolent.

Acute melioidosis septicemia is the most severe complication of the infection. It presents as a typical sepsis syndrome with hypotension, high cardiac output, and low systemic vascular resistance. In many cases, a primary focus in the soft tissues or lung can be found. The syndrome, usually in patients with risk factor comorbidities, is characteristically associated with multiple abscesses involving the cutaneous tissues, lung, liver, and spleen, and a very high mortality rate of 80%-95%. With prompt optimal therapy, the case fatality rate can be decreased to 40%-50%.

The melioidosis bacillus is intrinsically insensitive to many antimicrobials, and, in fact, bioterrorism strains may be engineered to be even more resistant. _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ is usually inhibited by tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT), antipseudomonal penicillins, carbapenems, ceftazidime, and amoxicillin/clavulanate or ampicillin/sulbactam. Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime have good in vitro activity but poor efficacy, and cefepime did not appear, as well, to be equivalent to ceftazidime in a mouse model. The unusual antimicrobial profile of resistance to colistin and polymyxin B and the aminoglycosides but sensitivity to amoxicillin/clavulanate is a useful tool to consider in treatment of infection with the organism.

The randomized and quasi-randomized trials comparing melioidosis treatment have been reviewed, and it was found that the formerly standard therapy of chloramphenicol, doxycycline, and SXT combination had a higher mortality rate than therapy with ceftazidime, imipenem/cilastatin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate (or ampicillin/sulbactam). The betalactam-betalactamase inhibitor therapy, however, seemed to have a higher failure rate.

Although a classical infection in eastern Asia and northern Australia, cases have been acquired in Africa, the Caribbean basin, Central America, and, as in this case, South America, particularly Brazil. This review is important to highlight for clinicians to consider the infection in individuals outside the classical endemic areas. This 2016 article (Limmathurotsakul D, Golding N, Dance DA, et al., Predicted global distribution of _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ and burden of melioidosis. Nat Microbiol. 2016;1:15008. article available at http://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20158.pdf) for 2015 estimates the burden of melioidosis for the areas of major and some risk as follows:

Area / Population at risk in millions / Melioidosis cases in thousands / Melioidosis deaths in thousands
South Asia / 1525 / 73 / 42
East Asia and Pacific / 858 / 65 / 31
Sub-Saharan Africa / 602 / 24 / 15
Latin America and Caribbean / 246 / 2 / 1
Middle East and North Africa / 49 / less than 1 / less than 1

Ceara is one of the 27 states of Brazil, located in the northeastern part of the country, on the Atlantic coast. It can be found on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cear%C3%A1#/media/File:Ceara_in_Brazil.svg. - Mod.LL
