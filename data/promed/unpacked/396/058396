An acquaintance of a Little League player from Japan diagnosed with
measles last week at the World Series may have also contracted the
contagious illness, the state health department said Friday [24 Aug
2007] night. The state was awaiting test results to confirm the
diagnosis, health department spokeswoman Larissa Bedrick said.
Little League spokesman Lance Van Auken said Friday night [24 Aug
2007] there was a confirmed 2nd case of measles, and that the person
has no connection to the Little League World Series.
"We're looking at a likely 2nd case,'' Bedrick said in a phone
interview. We do believe these 2 individuals had contact back in
Japan, not here. ... They are acquaintances."
State health officials planned a news conference Saturday [25 Aug
2007] at the Little League complex in South Williamsport, before the
start of the international championship game between Japan and
Curacao. The state was setting up an information booth there to
answer questions, Bedrick said.
Bedrick said most people should not be worried about contracting
measles. "The majority of people are immune to measles or have some
level of immunity," she said. Those still worried will be able to get
a free vaccination shot at the information tent, she said.
The player with measles was quarantined on 16 Aug 2007, when he was
diagnosed. He was released from isolation Sunday [19 Aug 2007] after
doctors said he was no longer contagious, and has played with the
squad this week.
Little League officials have not released the boy's name, citing
privacy rules. The boy specifically had rubeola or the "7-day
measles," Little League medical director Dr. David Ambrose said. Van
Auken said Little League learned of the latest case from the state
Friday [24 Aug 2007] afternoon. That person did not have access to
the team dormitory complex known as "The Grove," he said.
Little League officials last week asked players, coaches, and others
with Grove access to either prove they already had measles shots;
take a blood test; or get an immunization shot on site. About 500
kids and coaches were affected. Those people have been cleared, Van Auken said.
Measles is a highly contagious illness spread by a virus transmitted
by direct contact with infectious droplets or, less commonly, through
the air, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). While no longer common in the United States, the
World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 30 million people are
affected by measles each year. The illness is relatively common
elsewhere in the world, including some developed countries in Europe and Asia.
Japan plays Curacao for the international championship Saturday [25
Aug 2007], and Warner Robins, Georgia, will face Lubbock, Texas, for
the US title. The winners meet Sunday [26 Aug 2007] for the Little
League World Series crown.
