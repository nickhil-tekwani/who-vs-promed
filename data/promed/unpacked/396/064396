2004/127 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
-----------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance for
2004 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2004/081) from the
following countries: Algeria, Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic,
Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Guernsey, Hungary, Ireland, Israel,
Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Tunisia, United Kingdom. When a consignment has been
re-exported, and the country of origin is unknown, the re-exporting country
is indicated in brackets. When the occurrence of a pest in a given country
is not known to the EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance made
because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications of
non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the report is
only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent their notifications.
Note: In EPPO RS 2004/084, a report was made by the NPPO of France about a
finding of imported _Pelargonium_ plants infected by _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ causing an outbreak which was later eradicated.
Investigations done to trace back the origin of the material had shown that
plants might have come from different origins. Among these, Israel was
mentioned as a possibility. The NPPO of Israel stressed that _R.
solanacearum_ is a regulated quarantine pest which is totally absent from
its territory, and denied the fact that plants could have been produced in
Israel.
