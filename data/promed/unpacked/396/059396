Chiradzulu District Hospital has sent to Lilongwe samples taken from a suspected monkeypox patient who died Friday morning [10 Jun 2022] at Chiradzulu District Hospital.

According to a report from Chirazulu District Health Office dated 10 Jun [2022], the patient was taken to the hospital on Wednesday [8 Jun 2022] and presented with a painful rash all over the body with itchy and burning sensation. The rash started from the head and spread to all parts of the body. The patient also had fever and body and back pains

The symptoms started on 5 Jun [2022]. [The patient] was admitted at the Chiradzulu district hospital on 8 Jun [2022], taken to the isolation ward on 9 Jun [2022] after suspecting monkeypox, and pronounced dead in the morning of 10 Jun 2022.

From interviews, health workers noted that there was no known case of monkeypox from the area where the suspected case was coming from, and he had no travelling history to link with the infection transmission or that it has been imported from somewhere. The patient was working as a farmer, and there was no person at home with the same condition.

"The suspected monkeypox case from Chiradzulu died before all investigations were completed to confirm or rule out the disease. While some clinical presentations were similar to that of monkeypox, the epidemiological links suggest otherwise. As such, laboratory findings remain critical in ascertaining the case," reads part of the report.

The patient was aged 48 years and hailed from Muhiwa village, T/A Juma, Mulanje.

Monkeypox has been spreading across the world since May this year [2022], with over 1300 cases reported in various countries across the globe.

[Although ProMED has not posted cases of monkeypox (MPX) in Malawi before, occurrence of that infection is not surprising. Cases of MPX are occurring in several African countries this year (2022) and earlier. Very recent cases have been diagnosed in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see Monkeypox - Africa (09): Central African Region 20220613.8703828). Now there has been a fatal case in Malawi, suspected to be due to a monkeypox virus infection. As the above report notes, laboratory confirmation is essential to confirm or rule out an MPX virus infection. If this is an MPX virus infection, the situation where it was acquired is not given. Apparently, it was not due to transmission from another infected individual, nor is there mention of contact with rodents, the suspected wild mammal reservoirs of this virus. - Mod.TY
