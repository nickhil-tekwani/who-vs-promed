["African horse sickness (AHS) is an infectious but noncontagious viral disease affecting all species of equidae caused by an Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae and characterised by alterations in the respiratory and circulatory functions. AHS is transmitted by at least 2 species of _Culicoides_. Nine different serotypes have been described.

All serotypes of AHS occur in eastern and southern Africa. AHS serotypes 9, 4 and 2 have been found in North and West Africa, from where they occasionally spread into countries surrounding the Mediterranean. Examples of outbreaks that have occurred outside Africa are: in the Middle East (1959-1963), in Spain (serotype 9, 1966, serotype 4, 1987-1990), and in Portugal (serotype 4, 1989).

Laboratory diagnosis of AHS is essential. Although the clinical signs and lesions are characteristic, they can be confused with those of other equine diseases.

As a viral disease, the laboratory diagnosis of AHS can be based on the identification of infectious virus, virus nucleic acid, viral antigens or specific antibodies. A wide variety of laboratory tests have been adapted for the detection of both AHS virus (AHSV) and specific antibodies.

There is no evidence that humans can become infected with any field strain of AHSV, either through contact with naturally or experimentally infected animals or by virus manipulation in laboratories." Source: http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.01_AHS.pdf.

AHS is one of the diseases for which the OIE grants official status. The map showing OIE Member Countries' official status for AHS (last update November 2018) is available at http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/official-disease-status/african-horse-sickness/en-ahs-carte/. - Mod.CRD
