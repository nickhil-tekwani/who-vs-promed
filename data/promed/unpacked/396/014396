There is a more recent reference from L. E. Carmichael (_Brucella canis_.
In: Nielsen, K., J. R. Duncan, editors. Animal brucellosis. Boca Raton:
CRC Press Inc.: 1990;335-50). Another relevant reference is Hall, W.H.,
Epidemic brucellosis in beagles, J. Infect. Dis. 124:615-618 (1971).
_B. canis_ causes mild disease in humans. Brucellosis by any strain is not
known to be contagious human to human. Live bacteria are shed in the urine
of infected animals, so this might be a place to focus in this case.
Obviously, any abortion products or dead animals should be disposed of with
adequate protection (contagious by aerosol).

In response to the questions about the canine brucellosis outbreak in
clinically normal dogs, I have a few suggestions regarding management of
the dogs.
First, are the dogs' titers high? Is it likely that these dogs are
actively infected? This should best be documented with culture of blood or
lymph node aspirates, not by serology. If the dogs are culture negative,
they are much less likely to pose a risk to people, even though seropositive.
Second, are the dogs intact? I would surmise that the source of the
epidemic is a high shedder reproductively intact, likely female during
parturition or abortion. If all dogs are spayed/neutered, they are less
risky than intact dogs which maintain the organism in high levels in
testicles or female tracts. Any intact male dogs should be carefully
palpated for testicular abnormalities.
Third, _B. canis_ can indeed infect humans, and the fact that it does not
commonly do so is due in part to the relative infrequency of human contact
with infected dogs, in contrast to livestock managers' contact with
infected livestock.
To summarize, the dogs should be cultured/palpated. Any negative dogs
should be spayed/neutered (this goes for seropositive and seronegative
dogs), and positive dogs could be treated if the owners desire. Any
veterinarian doing spays/neuters should be informed about the _Brucella_
exposure.

[I would like to see the exposure data on _B. canis_ compared to other
_Brucella_ species causing disease in livestock. I am not sure that there
is all that much contact with infected livestock in developed countries.
Brucellosis is becoming quite rare in dairy cows and swine, two of the
historical foci of infection. In any case, thanks very much for your
excellent suggestions on management of exposed and infected dogs. Since we
haven't received much more, I'll cut this thread here. - Mod.PC
