At least 106 people, most of them children, have been hospitalized in
the last week following a cholera outbreak in Tanzania's
semiautonomous island of Zanzibar, an official from the Ministry of
Health said on Wed, 9 Aug 2006. "Already one person has died," Dr
Omar Suleiman, the director of information policy in the Ministry of
Health and Social Welfare, said. He attributed the latest cholera
outbreak to the public's reluctance to observe hygiene, including the
proper use of toilets.
"We call upon the public to observe health precautions by boiling
drinking water and making use of toilets," Suleiman said.
"Unfortunately in a village of about 371 homes, only 9 houses have
toilets."
Last week, health officials on the island reported that at least 454
children had been treated for severe dysentery and diarrhea at the
Mnazi-Mmoja Hospital. Cholera and diarrhea outbreaks started in Mar
2006, with a resurgence in late May and June, before erupting again
in Jul 2006 in most areas of the Zanzibar Municipality and Pemba
Island.
The latest outbreak has led to the establishment of an indefinite
quarantine in some villages north of the island. The selling of fresh
food has also been prohibited.

year. More recently, diarrhea and dysentery highlighted the reports
and it appears that cholera has been reported again.
