An outbreak of dengue fever in the south Kordofan region of central
Sudan in October has claimed the lives of an estimated 75 people and
affected 300 others, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and the
country's health ministry reported on Thursday.
"In order to care for those affected, we have trained hospital staff
in treatment methods and are working to keep the affected individuals
isolated so as to avoid new spread," said Guido Sabatinelli, head of
the WHO office in Sudan.
The epidemic has hit 12 communities in the eastern region of Southern
Kordofan, including Habila, Dilling, Kurtala, Julud, Abu Gubeiha,
Umbrembita and Alrigul towns. Cases of dengue fever also had been
reported in Kassala and Blue Nile states to the east.
The illness is spread through the bite of a type of mosquito. "The
key is ridding the area of these mosquitoes -- so we are spraying the
breeding area and also homes and surrounding areas," Sabatinelli
explained.
Symptoms include sudden high fever, severe headache and pain behind
the eyes and in the muscles and joints. Proper and early treatment
can relieve the symptoms and prevent complications and death.
Dengue haemorrhagic fever is a more severe form of the disease, in
which bleeding and shock sometimes occur, leading to death. It is
most serious in children. Bleeding usually occurs after 3-5 days of
fever.
WHO, the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), local and international NGOs as
well as the Ministry of Health had begun distributing thousands of
mosquito nets and large quantities of insecticides to people in the
affected areas.
Sabatinelli pointed out that mass population movements following the
signing early this year of the peace agreement ending civil war in
southern Sudan and the movement of nomadic communities could cause
the virus to spread to other regions.
The UN health agency had sent an epidemiologist and specialised
doctor to Kadugli, Southern Kordofan's capital, to assess the
situation.
"It is important to immediately assess if this type of mosquito is
present in the north and the west to know whether or not the disease
will spread," said Sabatinelli, adding that WHO had also hired an
entomologist to evaluate the current risk factors in those areas.
The 1st recorded dengue fever outbreak in Sudan was reported in the
mid-1980s in Red Sea state. Its case fatality rate was 25 percent.

[Kordofan is also spelled Kurdufan, a region constituting the central
area of The Sudan. It lies between Darfur in the west and the valley
of the White Nile River in the east. Kordofan covers an area of about
150 000 square miles (390 000 square km). The northern part of the
region is desert and has sandy soils and few topographical features.
Most of the people in Kordofan are Arabs. Minorities include the
Nubian, Beja, Daju, Zaghawa, and Darfunj peoples. - Mod.RY]

During the 43rd epidemiological week, 1029 dengue fever cases were
diagnosed, 78 of them corresponding to the hemorrhagic form [DHF]
(7.6 percent), and the rate for dengue fever/hemorrhagic dengue fever
is 12:1. Cumulated case toll for the year is 34 926 cases, and 6.2
percent of which are hemorrhagic dengue fever (2178 cases), and the
rate for dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever is 15:1. Cumulated
morbidity rate is 131.4 per 100 000 inhabitants. Circulating
serotypes are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Cumulated case number for this period
in 2005 shows a 35.2 percent increase compared to the same period of
20024. This week no deaths from dengue have been reported.
There is a 6.5 percent decline in the number of cases compared to
last week, corresponding to an epidemic (see the endemic channel).
51.6 percent of all cases notified are less than 15 years old; 15-24
years old is the 2nd in case frequency, 20 percent. Federal entities
notifying the most cases are as follows: Capital District (95),
Merida (89), Lara (89), Barinas (82), and Tachira (79).

Dengue hemorragic fever [DHF] caused 11 deaths [so far in 2005] in
Nicaragua, and authorities expect an "accelerated" increase in cases
by the end of the current rainy season, official spokesmen informed.
The death toll reported for the period between January and October
2005 is higher compared to that for 2004, when there was only one
death because of dengue hemorragic fever, according to the latest
report issued by the Ministry of Health (MINSA).
Statistics report 117 [confirmed] cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever,
and a total of 1322 cases of classic dengue fever, 483 additional
cases compared to figures for 2004.
The increase in deaths caused by dengue fever is because most persons
affected "arrive late to health facilities. "When they do arrive, the
condition is quite advanced," Dr. Francisco Acevedo, Director of
Transmissible Diseases, told AFP.
Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, has the highest death figure,
4 cases, followed by Estela (north), 3; Granada (southwest), 2;
Chontales (central), 1; and Matagalpa (north), 1.
The percentage of households affected by the presence of the mosquito
vector (_Aedes aegypti_) surpasses 5 per cent (considered as
"acceptable"), and in some departments it is as high as 20 per cent,
the report pointed out.
Dr. Acevedo indicated that 3 serotypes of the infection are present
in the country, in some areas these are simultaneously occurring,
which "increases the risk for the emergence of hemorrhagic dengue
fever cases" a condition that usually affects persons that already
had the classical form of dengue fever.
This is a latent hazard "if no control actions are performed in order
to abort this increase" for this disease once the rainy season is
over, when it is more feasible that stagnant water is formed, where
the mosquito vector may easily reproduce, he added.
