Health officials say a yearling filly has died of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus near Ocala. [The] owner says the horse started acting oddly in late June 2014 and died within 2 days.

The Ocala Star-Banner reports test results confirmed this week that the filly died of the virus. [The horse's] veterinarian notified Marion County officials of the results.

Since 22 Apr 2014, the local health department has issued 4 notices of positive tests for the mosquito-borne illness.

The virus can also affect humans, and health officials are warning residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. In humans, the virus may cause fever, muscle aches, headaches and seizures

[A horse owner] took every precaution against the eastern equine encephalitis virus. She vaccinated her thoroughbreds, used spray to help keep the mosquitoes -- which carry the virus -- away, and even gave the horses booster shots after several cases of the virus were reported in Marion County.

Still, in late June 2014, a yearling filly [she] was planning to sell at the Ocala Breeders' Sales August [2014] sale started acting oddly. "She kept falling," said [the horse owner], who, along with her husband, owns [a farm] near Ocklawaha. "It was 26 June 2014 when she started showing signs. We stayed up with her all night. We kept hoping she would come around," [the horse owner] said.

But the young filly, did not respond to treatment and died. "She was gone in 2 days," [the owner] said.

This week, test results confirmed the filly died of eastern equine encephalitis. The county is being notified of the death by [the horse's] veterinarian.

The Florida Department of Health in Marion County has issued 4 notices of positive tests for the virus since 22 Apr 2014. The last 2 cases were only 2 weeks apart, with the most recent on 29 Jun 2014, spurring the agency to issue a mosquito-borne illness advisory.

Eastern equine encephalitis can affect humans as well as horses. "Residents and visitors need to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and take basic precautions to help limit exposure to mosquitoes that can carry diseases," said Dan Dooley, environmental administrator for the Florida Department of Health in Marion County.

[It is difficult to understand what happened here. The horse appears to have been foaled on 17 Mar 2014. One has to wonder whether the dam was vaccinated prior to foaling and early enough to provide some maternal antibodies. The articles state that the horses were vaccinated, implying the foal was vaccinated. So this foal is approximately 3.5 months. The next question is: When was this foal vaccinated and how many times? Or, was the filly immunocompromised?

Vaccines are very effective when used appropriately. It is very sad to lose an animal you are attached to, and we are sorry for every person's loss. It remains important to vaccinate your animals, remove mosquito breeding areas, and use mosquito repellent.
