Here are a few more "reverse zoonoses" (aka zooanthroponoses) to add to the
list. Diseases that have been strongly suspected, or documented as having
been transmitted from humans to animals include _Mycobacterium
tuberculosis_ (from humans to nonhuman primates, Asian elephants and
psitticine birds), hepatitis A ( from humans to New World monkey species),
and herpesvirus simplex (from humans to marmosets and tamarins).

I have been puzzeled by the expression "reverse zoonosis" in [recent
issues of ProMED-mail. The term "zoonosis" was originally used by German
authors for "diseases of animals". It was later applied, in a loose
fashion, to "diseases of animals transmitted to man".

In 1959 a Joint Committee of Experts on Zoonosis from WHO and FAO defined
zoonoses as "diseases naturally transmitted among man and other
vertebrates"(see Fiennes R. Zoonoses and the origins and ecology of human
diseases. London: Acad Press, 1978).

Epidemiologists and parasitologists often use expressions like
"anthroponosis", "anthropozoonosis", and
"zooanthroponosis" inconsistently. Russian and some eastern European
authors use "zooanthroponosis" for what WHO/FAO defined as "zoonosis" (see
Galuzo IG. Twenty years of natural-nidality studies. In: Levine ND
(editor). Natural nidality of diseases and questions of parasitology.
Urbana: Univ. Illinois Press, 1968).

Furthermore, current definitions of these terms are not ethimologically
correct. Such expressions are reminiscent of an anthropocentrism which is
alien to sound biological, evolutionary, and ecological thought. And it
would be almost impossible to demonstrate, in many instances, if a disease
affects more human beings or more non-human vertebrates.
