Dengue Fever Hits Latin America
--------------------------------
COATEPEQUE (Guatemala): Hemorrhagic dengue fever has killed at least 70
people in Latin America this year. There is no cure for dengue fever and
medical experts aren't sure how the [virus causing dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) differs from the virus causing non-fatal forms of dengue fever. [It
may be, rather, that it is an altered host response to the infection that
results in DHF. - Man. Ed. DS.
However, doctors can save those stricken with DHF by treating its symptoms
and replenishing the blood and plasma lost to internal bleeding, provided
the patients receive treatment in time.
A global pandemic of dengue fever began in Southeast Asia after World War
II and began intensifying in 1982, according to epidemiologists at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. [The virus is
transmitted by mosquitoes [multiplying in the standing water [located
around many homes in Central and South America.
"One infected person can infect an entire neighborhood," said Jorge Arias,
Latin American Adviser on Communicable Diseases for the Washington-based
Pan American Health Organization. "Once a mosquito bites someone with
dengue, it becomes very easy for that mosquito to give it to dozens of others."
In El Salvador, doctors have seen more than 330 new cases of DHF since
October [2000, when the government declared a nationwide state of
emergency. In 11 months this year, 35 people have died from complications
related to DHF, Health Minister Jose Lopez Beltran said. That number was
expected to exceed 45 by the end of the year.
A contingent of dengue experts from the United States and around the world
have since arrived to treat and observe more than 3000 patients suffering
from both the potentially fatal and the non-fatal forms of dengue fever.
Dengue has also killed 10 people in Honduras so far this year and doctors
were watching hundreds of patients believed to be suffering from the
[potentially fatal form of dengue, Health Ministry officials reported.
According to Arias, complications caused by dengue fever have also killed 7
people in the Dominican Republic, 4 in Venezuela and claimed 3 victims in
Nicaragua and Brazil.
A total of 8 Guatemalans have died from the effects of dengue virus
infection, 6 of whom were children [resident in the sweltering and
[untidy town [Coatepeque of 200 000 people located 130 miles west of
Guatemala City. "We are on red alert," said Saul Orlando Martinez, Head of
Coatepeque's National Hospital. "We can treat patients who come in with
internal bleeding, but we don't know how many others are out there
suffering from a disease that [may kill them next week."
If treating dengue patients is difficult, however, officials have found
that educating the local population on the disease is even tougher. Public
Health Ministry officials have spent more than [US $130 000 since
September on radio spots and pamphlets, but it is clear that dengue fever
remains almost a complete mystery [to the majority of the inhabitants of
the city.
