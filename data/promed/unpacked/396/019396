Microbiology: PCR analysis of tissue samples from the 1979 Sverdlovsk
anthrax victims: The presence of multiple _Bacillus anthracis_ strains in
different victims. Paul J. Jackson et al.
Abstract: [edited] An outbreak of human anthrax occurred in Sverdlovsk,
USSR (now Ekaterinburg, Russia) in April 1979. This was officially &
repeatedly blamed on the consumption of contaminated meat, but western
governments believed it resulted from inhalation of spores accidentally
released from a nearby military research facility.
Tissue samples were obtained from 11 victims who died during the epidemic
and high-quality total DNA was extracted from these samples. The extracted
DNA was analyzed using PCR to determine whether it contained _Bacillus
anthracis_-specific sequences. Double PCR using "nested primers" increased
the sensitivity of the assay significantly. Results demonstrated that the
entire complement of _B. anthracis_ toxin and capsular antigen genes
required for pathogenicity were present in tissues from each of these
victims. Tissue from a [subcutaneous] vaccination site [from the single
individual in this series who had been vaccinated; he died 4 days later]
contained primarily nucleic acids from a live vaccine, although traces of
genes from the infecting organisms were also present.
PCR analysis using primers that detect the vrrA gene variable region on the
_B. anthracis_ chromosome demonstrated that at least four of the five known
[VNTR] strain categories defined by this region were present in the tissue
samples from these eleven individuals. [Some samples had only one, others
had mixtures.] Only one category is found in a single _B. anthracis_ strain.

New Research on Soviet Anthrax Leads to Questions About Vaccine, N Wade.
The discovery is that the anthrax spores released in a 1979 accident at a
Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk probably contained a blend of at
least four different strains of anthrax bacilli. Sverdlovsk -- now
Yekaterinburg -- lies in the Urals 900 miles east of Moscow.
The finding comes from an analysis of tissues taken from victims who died
in the Sverdlovsk outbreak. The tissues were saved by two Russian
pathologists at the Sverdlovsk hospital, and never came to the attention of
Soviet authorities. Later the [junior Russian pathologist, Lev Ginsberg,
brought their unique tissue block collection from 42 individuals to the
Department of Pathology, Galveston, where they were re-cut and re-examined
in collaboration with David Walker and his staff.]
With the availability of new techniques, Dr. Paul J. Jackson [& colleagues]
identified at least four different strains of anthrax in the tissues of
[eleven] victims.
The Los Alamos finding raises the question of why the Soviet scientists
would go to the trouble of developing an anthrax weapon with many strains
instead of just one. Since they would almost certainly have acquired the
American vaccine, some experts believe that the multi-strain blend was
designed to overcome its defenses.
Another, more innocent, possibility is that the multiple strains came from
the vaccines with which many inhabitants of Sverdlovsk were inoculated
after the accident. The Soviets used a vaccine composed of two live but
nontoxic strains of the bacillus. The authors concede that this is a
possibility but believe that the airborne spores of anthrax released in the
accident were the more likely source of the multiple strains. Most of the
tissues were taken from victims who died before the vaccinations began, and
they contain[ed the capsule] plasmid that the [STI] vaccine strains lack.
[Only one of the eleven had been vaccinated before dying.]
The news release issued by Los Alamos in conjunction with Jackson's report
states that "a mixture of strains used as a weapon might overcome vaccines
against anthrax or therapeutic agents used to combat the resulting
disease." Col. Arthur M. Friedlander, one of the Army's leading experts on
anthrax, strongly disagreed with this statement, calling it "entirely
speculative and incorrect." The American vaccine which will be given to all
military personnel is not a live vaccine -- like the Soviet one -- but is
based on a single protein component [Protective Antigen] of the anthrax
bacillus. This component is the same in all strains of anthrax, Friedlander
said, meaning that the American vaccine should protect people against one
or many strains with roughly equal effectiveness. Friedlander is chief of
the bacteriology division of the Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md.
Later Monday, the Los Alamos press office revised its statement so as to
avoid criticism of the Army's vaccine, while repeating the original
principle. According to the revised statement, "While mixtures of strain of
anthrax might overcome or confuse defensive strategies, there is no
experimental data or evidence to suggest that such a mixture is resistant
to the AVA licensed anthrax vaccine used by the U.S. military."
Although inspectors from the UN Special Commission have recovered anthrax
spores from Iraq, it could not be learned whether they contained one or
many strains of the bacillus. Dr. Frank J. Gaffney Jr., director of the
Center for Security Policy in Washington, said he had no specific knowledge
of Soviet-Iraqi cooperation on biological warfare but that "the closeness
of the two regimes makes me think at a minimum that Iraq was getting Soviet
support."
The publication of the Los Alamos findings in an academic journal seems
designed to put firm though not embarrassing public pressure on the Russian
authorities to explain exactly what was happening at the Sverdlovsk
biological warfare facility. In 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
of the Sverdlovsk accident, "The KGB admitted that our military
developments were the cause," but he did not elaborate on how the accident
occurred. "What the world still needs to hear is what was the work that was
going on there," said Dr. Matthew S. Meselson, Harvard University. "There
are people there who know what happened and they should speak up."
Even before the discovery of multiple strains, experts had begun to discuss
the adequacy of the current American vaccine after the Pentagon's
announcement in December that all military personnel would be vaccinated.
"I think it is a pretty good vaccine given that it is a 1960s standard and
pretty crude technology," said Dr. Phillip Russell, former commander of the
U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command. "Can we make a better
one? Sure as hell we can," he said. With modern methods it would be
possible to purify the protein component on which the vaccine is based,
giving it more protection and fewer side effects.
Some scientists within the government say there is evidence that the
protein component does vary from one anthrax strain to another, though they
do not know if the variation is big enough to make a difference to the
vaccine.
The Los Alamos scientists say they are continuing their analysis to see if
the anthrax strains in the Sverdlovsk victims had been rendered resistant
to antibiotics, which can save patients if given soon enough. They declined
to say whether genes for resistance had been found.

[The US vaccine is perfectly adequate to protect against occupational
exposure and has successfully proven itself over many years. And while a
terrorist attack might reach occupational exposure levels, at worst, one
must presume that any military usage will be at levels, plus or minus
chemical enhancers, capable of over-riding any vaccine protection. Under
that scenario a multiple-strain weapon may have other capacities, such as
antibiotic resistance. The modest success of the Sverdlovsk civilian
medical authorities in treating hospital cases in 1979 might support such a
suggestion. No information has ever been made available on the Soviet
military losses and care though it is believed to exist. - Mod.MHJ]
