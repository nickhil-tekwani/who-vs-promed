With the Russian phytosanitary services cracking down on potatoes, the brown bacterial rot disease (_Ralstonia solanacearum_) was noticed [in] 2 potato consignments weighing 57 tonnes imported from India.

There were 9 cases in 2011 and 23 cases in 2014 when brown rot was detected in plant products imported from India. The agency has brought the issue to the notice of [the Indian] Ministry of Agriculture, and necessary steps are being taken to respond to Russia's concerns.

Based on the assessments of specialists from the Russian Agricultural Academy, the potential losses from the possible introduction of brown rot to Russia could be more than 50 billion rubles [USD one billion] a year. If stored incorrectly, a potato affected by brown rot could decimate entire consignments. An outbreak of this kind will also threaten tomatoes.

The agency reserves the right to impose temporary restrictions on the import of Indian potatoes.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler temperatures) or race 1 (prevalent in warmer areas). Yield losses are mostly caused by tuber rotting and, in many warmer areas of the world, brown rot is one of the main limiting factors in potato production. The pathogens can also affect tomato and other solanaceous plants. Different races and biovars cause lethal wilting diseases on more than 200 known hosts including many important crops.

Brown rot symptoms on potato include internal staining and rotting of tubers, wilting and death of plants, and may result in substantial yield losses. However, there may also be latent infections. The pathogens can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including insects), contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed potatoes), soil and water. They can survive in soil on plant debris or roots of hosts. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods (such as crop rotation) and limited genetic resistance may be used.

The pathogens have been included in the quarantine lists of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). Due to quarantine testing, Russia has been able to identify, and in some cases prevent entry of, brown rot infected potato consignments from various countries over recent years (see, for example, ProMED-mail posts 20140527.2500654, 20110418.1208 and 20080820.2595).
