Detection of bluetongue outbreak in Smolensk region of Russia in 2011
Panferova A, Koltsov A, Novikova M, et al. National Institute for Veterinary Virology and Microbiology
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In September 2011 bluetongue was detected on one farm in Smolenskaya region, which is located in the west part of Russia near the Belarus border. Cattle, imported from Jurgen Greiner Ginsterweg 1 24576 Hagen Germany [on] 29 Aug 2011, were tested in the period from 8 Aug 2011 to 20 Aug 2011 by ELISA and PCR in Germany and gave negative results in both tests.

The transportation route passed through Poland and Belarus. Since 29 Aug 2011 [the] cattle were quarantined on the farm in Russia. The 1st sampling was performed on 2 Sep 2011; then, the samples from 71 animals were tested in NRIVVaM [National Research Institute for Veterinary Virology and Microbiology, Russian Academy of Agricultural Science], Pokrov by ELISA and PCR with negative results in both tests.

The 2nd sampling was performed on 28 Sep 2011. Initially, 5 seropositive cattle were registered by ID Screen Bluetongue Competition ELISA kit (ID Vet, France); within them 4 animals were PCR-positive tested with in-house PCR kit with high Ct values. The confirmation of these results was performed using published protocols PCR (Shaw et al, 2007; Toussaint et al, 2007 for segment 5, and Orru et al, 2006) for different genome segments. Samples also showed high Ct values in all tests. Sampling was performed periodically with different intervals. The last time samples were taken was 26 Jan 2012.

Until that time, samples had shown PCR-positive results. Thus, BTV genome had been present in blood from cattle at least for 4 months. Later we made an attempt to identify the serotype of BTV by serotype-specific PCR as with published protocols for known European serotypes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 16 (Mertens et al, 2007, Vandenbussche et al, 2009, Hoffmann et al, 2009) and by in-house real-time RT-PCR for serotype 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 16. All attempts to identify serotype virus were unsuccessful. Then the RNAs, extracted from blood, placed on filter-paper were sent to the Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, Germany. The results of serotype-specific PCR using primers published by Eschbaumer et al, 2011, and following nucleotide sequencing have shown that [the] virus belongs to BTV-14.

Monitoring data (immediate notification to OIE, WAHID, 30 Dec 2011) based on PCR and ELISA analysis of local (cattle, sheep, and goats) and imported cattle indicate that BTV-14 circulated in Russia. In January [2012], [the] virus was isolated in our institute and BTV-14 was confirmed in VNT [virus neutralization test] with reference serum.

Testing of more cattle and sheep samples from the neighboring regions is ongoing and results will be presented.

Up to now, the epidemiology of BTV-14 infection is unclear and under investigation.

[On 30 Nov 2011, the Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor) reported that a routine test of imported German cattle for bluetongue, in Smolenskaya oblast, demonstrated antibodies to the virus. It further reported that according to preliminary data from the Russian National Reference Centre for Bluetongue, discussed with specialists from the OIE BT Reference Centre (IAH-Pirbright, UK), "it is very likely a new virus serotype that has not been previously reported in central and northern parts of Russia. Perhaps, a brand-new serotype" (see ProMED-mail posting 20111203.3524, which included a request for information). The possibility of imported infection was raised.

On 30 Dec 2011, Russia's CVO notified the OIE of an outbreak of bluetongue in the village of Korshuny, Urgansky raion, Smolenskaya oblast (province). The affected farm included 10 cattle, 9 goats, and 47 sheep, of which 5, 1, and 16 cases, respectively, were found positive; no mortality, culling, or slaughter were reported. According to the notification, the source of the outbreak/origin of infection was "unknown or inconclusive". Laboratory diagnosis was carried out by ELISA and CFT; serotyping was "pending" (see ProMED-mail post 20111231.3723).

A 3rd posting on BTV in Russia was posted on 24 Jan 2012. It addressed Russia's report "Detection of cattle with bluetongue antibodies delivered from Germany in Kaluga Oblast". Again, additional information was requested "to confirm -- or negate -- the suspected international spread and particularly the assumption that a novel serotype is involved" (see ProMED-mail post 20120124.1020349).

The Russian paper delivered during the 6th annual meeting of Epizone (Brighton, 12-14 Jun 2012) unfolds the identity of the BTV responsible for the infections reported from Russia. For the accumulated data/history of this serotype, previously isolated from ruminants in South Africa, USA, Belize, and Cameroon, please refer to the webpage "Isolates of Bluetongue virus type 14 (BTV-14) in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH Pirbright", at
http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/btv-14.htm. - Mod.AS]

[The analysis by several diagnostic procedures certainly confirms the presence of BTV-14 in the cattle imported into the Smolensk Region of Russia. I think it is still an open question concerning the origin of the infection. The initial infection could have occurred in Germany, during transit from Germany to Russia, or in Russia. After BTV-14 infection was identified, it was subsequently detected in local cattle, sheep, and goats. BTV-14 is now being transmitted locally. BTV-14 may have been present in Russia already since it appears that the veterinarians did not have a specific test for BTV-14 prior to this incident. My hunch would be that BTV-14 had reached Russia already and the imported cattle were infected there. However, the authors of the report remain uncommitted. - Mod.CP]
