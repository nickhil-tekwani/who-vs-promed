A dead 8-foot-long bluefin tuna [_Thunnus thynnus_] washed up on a
beach in New Hampshire Wednesday [5 Oct 2011], the latest of a number
of sea creatures whose bodies have mysteriously washed up on the
state's shore.

"All of this together is very concerning," said Ellen Goethel, a
marine biologist and vice chair of the Hampton Conservation
Commission.

Goethel's 31-year-old son found the tuna when he was walking Plaice
Cove Beach in Hampton. Goethel, who went to the beach to observe the
fish, said she had seen 5 dead seabirds and 3 dead seals on the beach
the week before [week of 25 Sep 2011].

"I don't believe that it was caught and lost. It wasn't injured from
fishing," Goethel said.

The New England Aquarium said last week [week of 25 Sep 2011] that a
dozen seal pups had washed up on the state's beaches. The aquarium is
conducting tests on the creatures to determine if disease could be the
cause of death. The tests are not expected back until Thursday [13 Oct
2011], Tony LaCasse, spokesman for the aquarium, said today [7 Oct
2011]. Tests are also being conducted on the dead birds, said Allison
McHale, fishery policy analyst with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.

Goethel is worried about the diseases the marine life may carry, such
as hepatitis. She added that many locals walk their dogs on the beach
on a daily basis. "My concern was to get the animals off the beach as
quickly as possible," she said.

[The broad range of taxa implicated (birds, mammals, fish) indicates
an unspecific cause and potential implications for public health,
domestic animal health, and biological conservation. Although the
attack rate does not seem to be elevated (1 fish, 5 sea birds, 3 adult
seals, and 12 pups), an outbreak investigation would be pertinent.
More information on the results of the investigation would be greatly
appreciated.
