- The New York City [NYC] Health Department has announced an increase in gonorrhea and syphilis cases among Black and Latin females in New York City during the 1st half of 2021.

- The Health Department issued a Health Alert noting that from the 1st half of 2019 to the 1st half of 2021, the city saw a 23% increase in gonorrhea cases and a 17% increase in cases among females of primary and secondary syphilis -- these are the stages when syphilis is considered the most contagious.

- According to health officials, these inequities in STI [sexually transmitted infection] rates among the minority groups can be attributed to long-term structural racism, which prevents communities of color from accessing vital resources.

Cases among people reported as Black or Latin accounted for the majority of female gonorrhea cases (58% of female cases with known race/ethnicity) and female primary and secondary syphilis cases (75%) in the 1st half of 2021.

Additionally, health officials note that screenings for sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, in [NYC] plummeted during the 1st half of 2020. The lack of data has made comparisons between 2020 and 2021 difficult.

STIs such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia are common and curable, officials said. However, if left untreated, they can cause lasting and serious health effects.

"We are deeply concerned about increases in sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among female New Yorkers, and we know that many New Yorkers have deferred routine sexual health services, such as STI testing, during the pandemic," said Health Commissioner Dr Dave A Chokshi. "Sexual health care is essential to a healthy life. If you are sexually active, now is the time to re-engage with routine STI testing so that you can seek treatment as soon as possible if you are positive."

Health officials recommend that those sexually active under 25 years of age should get tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia at least once a year.

In New York City, those who are pregnant must get tested for syphilis 3 times: at their 1st prenatal visit, at 28 to 32 weeks of their pregnancy (during their 3rd trimester), and at delivery. Syphilis testing is also indicated for all females at risk of infection, including those who have a sex partner(s) diagnosed with an STI.

[For a discussion of syphilis in the United States, please see my moderator comments in prior posts listed in the "See Also" section below. To summarize, syphilis reached a historic low in 2000 and 2001. Since then, the rate of primary and secondary (P&S), the most contagious stages of syphilis, has increased almost every year (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2019/overview.htm). Although rates of P&S syphilis have increased among men, likely attributable to increases in cases among men who have sex with men (MSM), increases among MSM slowed, but still accounted for 47% of all P&S syphilis cases, as well as 56% of all male P&S syphilis cases in 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm). Although rates of P&S syphilis are lower among women, the number of reported cases of P&S syphilis among women and the number of reported cases of congenital syphilis have increased every year since 2012 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/congenital-syphilis.htm).

In a CDC report on health disparities among specific population groups in the US, in reference to African Americans/Blacks (https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/healthdisparities/africanamericans.html#std):
"In 2018, 34.7% of reported P&S syphilis cases with known race/Hispanic ethnicity information occurred among Blacks. The rate of reported P&S syphilis cases among Blacks was 4.7 times the rate among Whites (28.1 versus 6.0 cases per 100 000 population, respectively). This disparity was similar for Black females and males. Similar disparities were seen in all regions of the United States. From 2014 to 2018, the rate of reported congenital syphilis increased 126.7% among Blacks (38.2 to 86.6 cases per 100,000 live births). In 2018, the rate of reported cases of congenital syphilis among Blacks was 6.4 times the rate among Whites (86.6 versus 13.5 per 100 000 live births, respectively);"

and in reference to people of Hispanic ethnicity/Latinx (https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/healthdisparities/hispanics.html): "In 2018, 23.3% of reported P&S syphilis cases with known race/Hispanic ethnicity information occurred among Hispanics. The rate of reported P&S syphilis cases among Hispanics was 2.2 times the rate among Whites (13.0 versus 6.0 cases per 100,000 population, respectively). This disparity was greater for Hispanic males (2.2 times the rate among White males) than Hispanic females (1.7 times the rate among White females). From 2014 to 2018, the rate of reported congenital syphilis increased 263.4% among Hispanics (12.3 to 44.7 cases per 100 000 live births). In 2018, the rate of congenital syphilis for Hispanics was 3.3 times the rate among Whites (44.7 cases versus 13.5 cases per 100 000 live births)."
