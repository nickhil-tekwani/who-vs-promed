SALMONELLA RODENTICIES (2)
==========================
These products date back to attempts to control vole plagues in
Thessaly and in France in the 1890s. Even early trials (which were on an
heroic scale with tons of rodenticide used) were not always successful.
During the second world war the Bureau of Animal Populations in Oxford
undertook a great deal of work on rodent control and concluded that the
continued use of such rodenticides could not be recommended because of
the hazards to human health.
Much of the rationale for the control of rodents ( in areas
where the better known zoonoses are uncommon - such as the UK) is the
perception that they carry diseases such as salmonella. In fact it is
quite difficult to find salmonellas in rodents in temperate climates
unless they are in situations where salmonellas are commonly found in
the environment (usually due to human activity - such as the use of
these baits). The whole situation was admirably summarised by Dr Charles
Elton (one of the founders of the science of animal ecology) who stated
that "the casual manner in which salmonella cultures have been strewn
over the countries of Europe is astonishing in itself; but that this
should have been done without first investigating the normal diseases
and parasites of small rodents is more astonishing still".
