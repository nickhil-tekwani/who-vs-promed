The ProMED alert to backpackers is well taken. Leptospirosis is a
common disease in the Pacific region. In the graphs available at
<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/wp/wp-content/uploads/Lepto-Australia.png>,
I've compared disease rates for Australia and New Zealand with those
of the United States.

Leptospirosis rates in nearby New Caledonia are even more striking,
and exceed those of salmonellosis, hepatitis A, hepatitis B,
gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. See graph available at

[ProMED-mail once again thanks Dr. Berger for his background reports.

It should be noted, however, that because of the relatively
nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of many infections,
the diagnosis of leptospirosis may be incorrectly made in the absence
of laboratory confirmation. See prior ProMED posts: Leptospirosis,
military personnel - Australia (QLD): not* 20050329.0910 and
Leptospirosis - Jamaica (02) 20071018.3409.
