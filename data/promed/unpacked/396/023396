[After 3 days with no new cases reported in Saudi Arabia, there have now been 2 additional cases, both from Riyadh. At early report, neither new case has a history of known high risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, although one case may have had contact with a known or suspected case in the healthcare environment.

With the addition of these newly reported cases and deaths, the tally of cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 837 including 361 deaths (case fatality rate 43.1 percent).

The newly reported death -- a 25-year-old female from Riyadh with a history of prior co-morbidities -- was difficult to identify for the original report. There was a 31-year-old female from Riyadh reported to be in critical condition on 26 Dec 2014, or, less likely, a 25-year-old female from Gondofah reported to be in home isolation on 25 May 2014. Clarification would be greatly appreciated.

As for the newly reported recovery, it is most likely the 69-year-old Saudi male reported to be in stable condition on 5 Jan 2015 with no known high risk exposures during the 14 days preceding the onset of illness.
