FDA Issues Warning on Alfalfa Sprouts
----------------------------------------
PEOPLE with weakened or developing immune systems -- those for whom
food-borne diseases pose a severe health risk -- now have something
else to worry about. And it is something normally billed as a health
food: alfalfa sprouts.
Enough sprouts have been found to be contaminated
with salmonella and _E. coli_ 0157:H7 for the Food and Drug
Administration to issue a warning about special dangers to children
under 10, the elderly, pregnant women and those with certain
diseases like AIDS and cancer. Even healthy adults can get sick from
these food-borne illnesses, but they are less likely to end up in
the hospital.
For years, sprouts have been sprinkled on salads and sandwiches with
a carefree abandon because they are supposed to be so healthful.
[The first outbreak in the USA of food poisoning linked to alfalfa
sprouts was detected in 1995.]
Alfalfa sprouts are only the third food item in the Food and Drug
Administration's recent effort to direct special warnings at this
most vulnerable part of the population.
Even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned
scientists and health professionals a year ago about alfalfa
sprouts, it was not until the end of last month that the Food and
Drug Administration issued its warning.
William Schultz, deputy director of the FDA
for policy, said "A warning directed at special
populations is a new tool the FDA has started to use.
It is a new concept for high-risk food."
In 1993, raw oysters became the first food to carry an FDA
warning for those with weakened immune systems. No new foods were
added to this list until two years ago, when unpasteurized juices
were pinpointed as risks; warnings, however, did not go up in
supermarkets until just last month. Alfalfa sprouts are No. 3.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since
1995, outbreaks of salmonella and _E. coli_ 0157:H7 in alfalfa
sprouts
in Kansas, Missouri, Michigan, Virginia and California have resulted
in 1300 confirmed cases of food poisoning and the likelihood of
thousands more. There has been one death.
The warning on the sprouts, issued on 31 Aug1998, came in an FDA
news release.
The problem with sprouts, which are almost always eaten raw, seems
to be in the sprouts themselves, not in the way they are served. The
fact that the sprouting process takes place in water may enhance the
ability of hazardous bacteria to multiply.
Three confirmed outbreaks this summer in California -- with a fourth
under investigation -- have prompted the California Health Services
Department to issue a statewide advisory about the potential risks.
The FDA followed suit. Its warning is considered an interim
measure, the Federal agency said, "until such time as intervention
methods are in place to improve the safety of these products."
Growers of sprouts are aware of the problem but not quite sure how
to fix it. One new decontamination procedure involves soaking sprout
seeds in a solution containing chlorine. The method is still being
evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency, but in the
interim, California has given its sprout industry emergency
permission to try the system out for one year.
