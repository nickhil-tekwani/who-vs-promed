[3] USA (Florida): case in infant

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In August 2022, the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) was notified of a suspected case of monkeypox in an infant aged <2 months who was admitted to a Florida hospital with a rash and cellulitis. This case report highlights findings from the related epidemiologic investigation and describes the public health actions taken.

The infant was initially evaluated in an emergency department (ED) for a raised erythematous rash on the arms, legs, and trunk which had been present for 5 days. A rash swab was collected for bacterial culture and yielded a negative test result. Varicella, herpes simplex virus, and HIV testing were also negative. The patient returned to the ED 2 days later, at which time the rash had progressed to include numerous, diffusely scattered papulovesicular lesions over the body, many with central umbilication. The infant was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum and started on intravenous antibiotics for secondary bacterial cellulitis associated with having scratched a lesion on the arm. The lesions subsequently spread to the back, soles of feet, face, and eyelid and became pustular over the first few days of admission. Swabs from forehead and back lesions tested positive for Orthopoxvirus DNA and Clade II Monkeypox virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction 10 days after rash onset (Figure). Results were confirmed by the Florida public health laboratory and CDC.â€  FDOH and hospital clinicians consulted with CDC regarding treatment options. The infant was treated with oral tecovirimat and Vaccinia Immune Globulin Intravenous. Prophylactic trifluridine drops were administered to prevent ophthalmic complications from the eyelid lesion. The infant remained afebrile and stable throughout the course of illness, tolerated the treatments well, and fully recovered.

The infant had no history of travel, no history of acute infections in the 3 weeks preceding rash onset, no known immunocompromising conditions, did not attend a childcare facility, and had no caregivers outside the home. Within the home, the infant was cared for by 4 caregivers. Caregiver A acted as the main guardian throughout the infant's hospital stay and had prolonged exposure with skin-to-skin contact. Caregiver B reported activities that placed him at high risk for monkeypox exposure during the 2 months preceding the infant's illness. Caregiver B reported hematuria and fever, followed by a rash within the 3 weeks before the infant's symptom onset. One day before the infant became symptomatic, caregiver B moved to another state and sought medical care for his symptoms. He received a positive Orthopoxvirus DNA test result 2 days after the infant's positive test result, after which, he was lost to follow-up. The infant had daily close contact with caregiver B in the home for 6 weeks before rash onset. Possible routes of transmission included shared bed linens and skin-to-skin contact through holding and daily care activities. Investigation identified 3 other household family members with household exposures to both the infant and caregiver B. Caregiver B, caregiver C, and the infant shared a bed for the 6 weeks preceding the infant's symptom onset. All household members (caregivers A, B, C, and D) held the infant with close skin-to-skin contact. Caregivers A, C, and D received postexposure prophylaxis with the JYNNEOS vaccine and remained asymptomatic at 22 days after the infant's symptom onset. Caregiver A had also received smallpox vaccination during childhood.

[4] USA (Los Angeles county): healthcare worker contracts monkeypox
Date: Thu15 Sep 2022
Source: ABC 7 [edited]
https://abc7.com/los-angeles-county-monkeypox-updates-workplace-exposure/12233025/


The nation's 1st case of a healthcare worker contracting monkeypox after being exposed on the job was reported in Los Angeles [LA] County earlier this week.

"We have identified a healthcare worker with monkeypox who appears to have been exposed to the virus at their worksite," said Dr Rita Singhal, chief medical officer for the LA County Department of Public Health.

Singhal said the local case is one of 8 known worldwide involving a healthcare employee exposed at work. She said the county has consulted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the case.

"Given that the risk for monkeypox for healthcare workers remains very low, we will continue to message on current infection-prevention control recommendations and in particular the use of appropriate PPE [personal protective equipment]," Singhal said.

The CDC recommends the monkeypox vaccine for people who are a close contact of someone who has disease; people who know a sexual partner was diagnosed in the past 2 weeks; and gay or bisexual men who had multiple sexual partners in the last 2 weeks in an area with known virus spread. Shots are also recommended for healthcare workers at high risk of exposure.

White House officials say they will allocate more vaccines to jurisdictions with the most at-risk communities.

Eligibility has been expanded to include pretty much anyone who is at risk of exposure. But despite more availability of vaccines, officials say the big challenge now is to get more people to come back for their 2nd doses.

[5] Europe: cases including healthcare workers
Date: Thu 15 Sep 2022
Source: Prensa Latina [edited]
https://www.plenglish.com/news/2022/09/15/europe-confirms-about-24000-monkeypox-cases/


A report published on Thursday [15 Sep 2022] by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said monkeypox cases across the continent amounted to 23 837.

Out of 10 288 cases of men with known sexual orientation, 97% identified as homosexual.

Of the total number of patients, only 670 were hospitalized and 226 required clinical care. There were 5 who were admitted to ICUs and 3 died, according to the report.

To date, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the ECDC are aware of 91 cases of monkeypox infection among health professionals, 3 of them due to exposure to body fluids while collecting samples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We describe monkeypox virus (MPXV) transmission from a patient to a healthcare worker through needlestick injury. A lesion appeared at the inoculation site 5 days after injury. Blood tested MPXV-positive by PCR before symptoms worsened; blood remained MPXV-positive at discharge 19 days after symptom onset. Postexposure prophylaxis could prevent potential MPXV bloodborne transmission.
