[Travellers should note that healthy people can be infected without showing
any symptoms, and that cholera is easily treated with the appropriate
antibiotics, and can be avoided by paying attention to what you eat and
drink, so there is no reason to cancel a trip to Guayaquil or Ecuador.
There is also no justification for placing an embargo on food exports from
