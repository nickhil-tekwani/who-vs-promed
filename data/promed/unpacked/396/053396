Concerning the Sarradet paper « a case of scrapie in a cow » (Rev. Med. Vet.
1883, 7, 310 - 312) there is a little bit of confusion in the recent Tom
Pringle commentary.
1/ There are some inaccuracies in translation - « boeuf » = OX (castrated
male) not cow - « queue » = tail not neck, as already mentioned.
2/ This paper is not a scientific article but rather a short paper about a
unique clinical observation.
3/ This disease for todays vet looks very much like Aujeszkys or
Pseudo-Rabies Diseases (PRD) (short duration, acute clinical stage, intense
itching of the base of the tail, death). This hypothesis is further support
by the fact that at this time (1883) in the South West Region of France,
there was close contact between cattle and pig herds. The main source of
PRDV in natural conditions is domestic pigs and wild boars.
4/ The seminal works for scientific characterization of any TSE, mainly
scrapie, was done between 1898 and 1939, precisely in Toulouse, France, in
coordination between veterinary and medical institutions. The first
essential contribution was given in 1898 by Benoit (professor in Toulouse
Medical University) and Morel (professor in Toulouse Veterinary School) in
the same journal as Sarradets paper (Rev. Med. Vet. 1898, 23, 397 - 400).
They characterized for the very first time, the nature and specificity of
microscopic neuronal vacuolization in TSE diagnosis. Thats to say that
before that time (1898) nobody, even performing gross necropsy and
microscopic examination, could really characterize scrapie from a scientific
point of view. Sarradet was not able to perform such additional
investigation, and he cannot investigate PRD virus, not yet discovered at
that time.
Just for information, the transmissibility of scrapie was first proven by
Cuillé and Chelle (Toulouse Veterinary School) between 1936 and 1939 (C.R.
Acad. Sciences, Paris, 1936, 203, 1552 - 1554 et 1939, 208, 1058 - 1060).
The whole story can be read in an article (in French !) from M. SAVEY (Bull.
Acad. Vet. de France, 1989, 62, 25 - 32).
It is, then, fair to say that Sarradets case is probably not a BSE-like
disease and that it is more probably a PRD case.
Nevertheless, the scientific hypothesis of a sporadic BSE-like disease
having existed in cattle for many years all over the world as does exist CJD
in man (incidence rate of 0,5 to 1 case by million per annum), though not
supported by Sarradets observations, continues to be a sound one. It has
been even more and more accepted since 1992 (SAVEY M. et all, Vet. Res,
1993, 24, 213 - 225) as an alternative hypothesis to the scrapie origin of
BSE epidemic in UK.
