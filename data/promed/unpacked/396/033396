[1] Astra Zeneca chimpanzee adenovirus vector vaccine
Date: Mon 23 Nov 2020

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/business/astrazeneca-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine.html



AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford announced on Monday [23 Nov 2020] that their inexpensive, easy-to-produce coronavirus vaccine appears effective, the latest in a string of encouraging results this month [November 2020] from leading vaccine developers. An early analysis of data from late-stage clinical trials found that AstraZeneca's vaccine was either 62 percent or 90 percent effective, depending on the manner in which the doses were given.

While the overall efficacy of the vaccine remains unclear, the encouraging preliminary results indicate that it has the potential to become a powerful new weapon in the war on the pandemic, which has killed more than 1.3 million people worldwide since January [2020] and is still spreading rapidly. AstraZeneca said it expected to begin distributing the vaccine this year [2020] and that it would be able to make up to 3 billion doses next year [2021]. At 2 doses per person, that would be enough to inoculate nearly 1 in 5 people worldwide.

Unlike some other leading vaccine candidates, the AstraZeneca offering can be quickly produced in vast quantities, will cost only a few dollars per dose, and is easy to store for long periods. That could substantially expand the number of countries and people that have access to the vaccine.

AstraZeneca's announcement came on the heels of Pfizer and Moderna's releasing trial results that showed their vaccines to both be about 95 percent effective. Those vaccines, however, can only be kept outside of ultracold freezers for a few weeks, making their distribution and storage more challenging.

The price of AstraZeneca's shot, at USD3 to USD4, is a fraction of the cost of some other vaccines. AstraZeneca has pledged to make it available at cost around the world until at least July 2021 and in poorer countries in perpetuity.

The varying effectiveness of AstraZeneca's vaccine reflected differences in how doses were administered in the late-stage trials. In the dosing plan that was 90 percent effective, study participants were given a half-dose of the vaccine and then, a month later, a full dose. The vaccine was less effective when people were given a standard full dose upfront, followed a month later by another full dose. On average, the vaccine was 70 percent effective.

The analysis, which looked at data from participants in Britain and Brazil, did not turn up any serious safety issues that were confirmed to be related to the vaccine. It had come under global scrutiny after AstraZeneca temporarily paused its trials in September [2020] after a participant in Britain developed a neurological illness.

Oxford and AstraZeneca said they would submit the trial data to regulators in Britain, the European Union, and Brazil and would seek emergency authorization to start distributing the vaccine in those places. British and European Union regulators have been conducting so-called rolling reviews of the vaccine, which could hasten the authorization process.

The path toward the vaccine being available in the United States is less clear. Because clinical trials in the United States were paused more than a month, longer than in Britain and several other countries, the US results are not expected until next year [2021]. And AstraZeneca has not been testing the more-effective half-dose regimen in its US trials. The company said it would work with the Food and Drug Administration to add it as quickly as possible to its ongoing trial.

In the meantime, AstraZeneca said, it will share its latest British and Brazilian trial data with the FDA this week. The company is seeking guidance on whether it should formally submit the findings for review and authorization for emergency use even though the American trial remains underway. Some experts said the FDA was unlikely to authorize the vaccine without more data, especially because fewer than 2800 participants in the clinical trials received the smaller 1st dose that yielded such strong results. That is a much smaller sample size than in Pfizer and Moderna's trials.

"I don't think the FDA had envisioned 3000 participants to base a decision," said Dr Eric Topol, a clinical trial expert at Scripps Research in San Diego. Pfizer and Moderna's vaccines are based on similar messenger RNA technology. It uses synthetic genetic material to stimulate cells to produce a harmless viral protein that the immune system can learn to attack. The AstraZeneca vaccine is different. It uses a weakened version of a chimpanzee adenovirus as a delivery vehicle to ferry coronavirus genes into human cells. That trains the immune system to fight future attacks from the actual coronavirus.

The company said its early analysis was based on 131 symptomatic coronavirus cases that turned up in participants at least 2 weeks after they had received their 2nd shot. None of the vaccinated people who developed the disease required hospitalization, AstraZeneca and Oxford said.

"Today marks an important milestone in our fight against the pandemic," AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said in a statement. "This vaccine's efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against COVID-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency."

In a call with reporters on Monday morning [23 Nov 2020], the Oxford scientists said they were still trying to understand why the vaccine was more effective with a smaller 1st dose. The 1st dose is supposed to prime the immune system, while the 2nd is supposed to boost its response.

Dr Saad B Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, pointed to several potential explanations for why the dosing regimens yielded different results. There could be key differences between the 2 groups, such as participants' ages or their past exposure to similar viruses, that influenced how they responded. The design of the vaccine could also play a role: The full dose could be giving participants immunity to the delivery vehicle and dampening their subsequent immune response. Sample size may also be at play. Because fewer participants received the smaller 1st dose, their results have less statistical power. Dr Omer cautioned against drawing definitive conclusions until more details were available. "I would withhold my judgment until we specifically look at more data," he said.

Pam Cheng, an executive vice president at AstraZeneca, told reporters on Monday [23 Nov 2020] that if the company received regulatory authorization, it planned to have 4 million doses available in Britain by the end of the year [2020]. By the end of March [2021], the company said, it would have at least 300 million doses of finished vaccine ready to distribute globally.

Even without delays, however, the vaccine is still a long way from being widely available. Regulators must assess the study data and decide whether to authorize the vaccine. AstraZeneca must ramp up production and work with government officials to roll out doses. And in the 1st weeks and months after the vaccine is authorized, it is expected to be available only to the highest-priority groups, likely health workers first, followed by other vulnerable groups. Ms Cheng said the regimen involving a half-dose would not significantly complicate the supply chain.

The FDA has said that it expected a COVID-19 vaccine to prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least half of people who are vaccinated. That is similar to the effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccines most years. More interim findings from other leading vaccine makers, including Johnson & Johnson, are expected soon.

The relatively simple storage requirements of AstraZeneca's vaccine are expected to make it easier to roll out than several of the other leading vaccines. Moderna's vaccine can be kept for up to a month at the temperature of an ordinary refrigerator. Pfizer's can be kept for up to 5 days in conventional freezers or in special coolers for up to 15 days, but otherwise needs ultracold storage.

Andrew Pollard, the Oxford researcher in charge of the trials, told reporters on Monday [23 Nov 2020] that the scientists' goal was "to make sure we can have a vaccine that was accessible everywhere." He added: "I think we've actually managed to do that." The data released on Monday came from AstraZeneca's Phase 2/3 clinical trial in Britain and its Phase 3 clinical trial in Brazil. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either the coronavirus vaccine or a meningitis vaccine as a control, followed by a booster shot of the coronavirus vaccine, the meningitis vaccine, or a placebo about 4 weeks later. Professor Pollard said the Oxford scientists hoped to submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal within 24 hours.

A vaccine deploying the technology behind AstraZeneca's candidate has never won approval. But the approach has been studied before, notably in a small 2018 study of an experimental vaccine against the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. That virus is related to SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. When COVID-19 emerged, the team of scientists at Oxford's Jenner Institute that had been leading the work on similar coronaviruses had a head start. Once the genetic code of SARS-CoV-2 was published in early January [2020], the Oxford team sped to adapt their platform to the new coronavirus and begin animal testing. They also needed a development and manufacturing partner and found one in AstraZeneca in April [2020]. Safety testing in Britain began that month [April 2020].

In May [2020], the US Department of Health and Human Services pledged up to USD1.2 billion to help fund AstraZeneca's development and manufacturing of the vaccine and secure at least 300 million doses if it proved to work. Alex M Azar II, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, called the deal "a major milestone" in the work of Operation Warp Speed, the US government's program to fast-track COVID-19 vaccines.

AstraZeneca has struck deals to supply doses of its vaccine, once authorized, to other wealthy nations, including Britain and other nations in Europe, as well as to lower- and middle- income countries. AstraZeneca's vaccine is on track to supply 44 percent of all doses to lower- and middle-income countries, and 33 percent of all doses globally, according to projections from the British research firm Airfinity, which tracks deals between vaccine manufacturers and governments.

[It is great to see another apparently effective vaccine. The manufacturer is promising to produce it in large quantities and make it available to developing countries at a low cost. It is unfortunate that so much vaccine data are presented by press release rather than through presentation of the data (though they promise to submit quickly). Clearly, the companies are putting their own spin on the data and it is very difficult to evaluate the findings. (No stratification by age, sex, comorbidities, race, etc., for example).

This vaccine appears much less effective than the RNA vaccines and the findings of 90% efficacy in one subgroup could just be a statistical fluke.

As mentioned in the article above, no vaccines using chimpanzee adenovirus as the vector have gone through approval to date. According to the NIAID (National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases) of the US NIH (National Institute of Health), there is an Ebola vaccine currently licensed to the Sabin Institute that uses a chimpanzee adenovirus.

"cAd3-EBO
---------
"NIAID and Okairos (a company later acquired by GSK) developed an Ebola vaccine candidate (now licensed to the Sabin Vaccine Institute) that uses a chimpanzee adenovirus (cAd3) vector, or carrier, to deliver Ebola genetic material. The gene inserts express an Ebola virus protein designed to prompt the human body to make an immune response.

"The cAd3-EBO Z vaccine (designed to protect against the Ebola Zaire virus species) proved to be safe and immunogenic when evaluated in numerous Phase 1 clinical trials, including at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The vaccine candidate also was tested in multiple Phase 2 trials in both adults and children, including the Phase 2 PREVAIL 1 trial in Liberia. The PREVAIL findings indicated the vaccine was well-tolerated and induced an immune response in recipients.

"The Sabin Vaccine Institute has also licensed the cAd3 platform to develop vaccines against Sudan virus, another Ebola virus species, and Marburg virus. NIAID and WRAIR are conducting a clinical trial examining the safety and dosage of an investigational vaccine designed to protect against Sudan virus (known as cAd3-EBO S) at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda. NIAID and WRAIR also are conducting another Phase 1 trial of a vaccine designed to protect against Marburg virus (cAd3-Marburg) at the WRAIR Clinical Trials Center in Silver Spring, Maryland." (https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/ebola-vaccines)

Phase 1 trials were small (refs 1,2) for development of the Ebola vaccine. Development of a MERS-CoV vaccine published on early trials in mice (ref 3) and early trials in livestock were conducted on a Rift Valley fever vaccine (ref 4).
A concern that is being raised is the small size of the trial population and even smaller size of the study group showing 90% efficacy with a half dose primer followed by a full dose 4 weeks later.

Recognizing we are in unchartered waters with new vaccine development, larger size trial populations seem warranted for all of the new vaccines.

[The case numbers for COVID-19 in Africa continue to rise and now has passed the 2 million mark at 2 070 172, with almost 50 000 deaths as of 23 Nov 2020. The case numbers and deaths are rising steadily compared to previous months, which is concerning. The case numbers started falling in early September 2020 but are now rising again, even though not as much as in other continents.

Despite this, there is still cause for concern because the case counts in Africa may not be the true situation on the ground. Some countries have stopped reporting or stopped testing because of lack of resources. Some of the countries are not testing enough people because of the high cost of testing. In Africa, over 80% of the COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, so health authorities have stopped contact tracing and mass testing. Only symptomatic cases and those wanting to travel out of their countries or arriving in the countries are tested. Few countries, therefore, are accounting for the weekly increase in case numbers and fatalities. - Mod.YA

This is from COVID-19 update (172): Africa, fatal 20201123.7966527. Mod.YA points out some of the realities in disease surveillance in many of the African countries most notably lack of resources for testing and the limited testing conducted, focusing on symptomatic cases. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 23 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov23_1606168703.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 46.4% of daily case numbers and 39.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 24.8 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Peru, Chile, Panama, and Puerto Rico. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Ecuador, and Dominican Republic. Costa Rica did not report any newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 34.9% of daily case numbers and 38.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 17.0 million. Countries not reporting cases today (23 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, UK, Poland, France, Ukraine, and Germany. 18 additional countries are reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (compared with 22 countries yesterday, 22 Nov 2020).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.5% of daily case numbers and 11.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.83 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, Palestinian Authority, Tunisia, UAE, Lebanon, and Libya. Yemen did not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.45 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Uganda, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.75% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.83 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, China, Guam, and Mongolia.

- The South East Asia region reported 9.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 8.9% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.4 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of newly confirmed cases and 77% of newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. With major countries in Europe not reporting over the weekend, European countries are still experiencing significant levels of transmission. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

[Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Sweden and Kazakhstan, among others. The number of countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours has dropped from 63 on Friday (20 Nov 2020) to 53 today (23 Nov 2020), suggesting continuation of reduced reporting as part of weekend artifact. In the past 24 hours, the USA (188 513), India (37 410), Russia (25 173), and Italy (22 927) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8306 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (22-23 Nov 2020). Noteworthy is crossing another million mark -- there have been over 59 million cases reported with over 1.4 million deaths.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, India, Russia, Italy, Spain (17 686), Brazil (16 603), UK (15 450), Poland (15 002), Germany (14 537), Iran (12 460), and Ukraine (10 945).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 1.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.8%. In the USA, the comparative 7-day averages show an 11.0% increase in confirmed cases and a 34.5% increase in daily reported deaths.

Impression: Even with a weekend decrease in reporting, the comparative 7-day averages show a weekly increase in reported cases and deaths at the global level, and continued uncontrolled transmission in the USA. - Mod.MPP]
