The Department of Veterinary Services in Mashonaland East has managed
to control a recent anthrax outbreak in Mudzi district. The outbreak
had killed several cattle and was mainly confined to Masarakufa area
although the whole district had to be put under quarantine.
Mashonaland East provincial veterinary surgeon Dr Farayi Chigwada
yesterday confirmed the control of the outbreak. "We held 2
successful rounds of vaccination in September while another one is
currently underway and the whole district is no longer under
quarantine," said Dr Chigwada. He confirmed that the Masarakufa area
has been having recurrent anthrax outbreaks over the years,
especially towards the rainy season because of spore's exposure from
the ground.
Butchers and cattle owners in Mudzi had been barred from slaughtering
livestock for meat while those who wanted beef had to import it from
other districts after certification by DVS. Even hotels and
restaurants in Mudzi were serving chicken and fish only as there was
no longer any beef from the butcheries. Villagers were warned not to
touch the carcasses of dead animals until the DVS confirmed the cause
of death. They were advised to burn and bury the carcasses of the
animals [that] died of anthrax.

[Clearly Dr. Chigwada is working very hard on this. This report
refers to "a recent anthrax outbreak in Mudzi district" and yet there
were 2 rounds of vaccination in September and a 3rd is in hand
(December). Something doesn't add up. Sterne vaccine, which is what
they have been using in Zimbabwe, should give adequate bovine cover
for about a year with one shot; as horses respond poorly many give them 2.
We have discovered a parallel situation in the eastern half of Buenos
Aires Province where they have been getting anthrax in herds in the
face of multiple vaccinations, to the point that it is now customary
to vaccinate 2 or 3 times a year. I would appreciate hearing from
members in Zimbabwe with information on this and the situation on the
ground in Mashonaland East. - Mod.MHJ]
