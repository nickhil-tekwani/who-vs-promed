EPIZOOTIC HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE, DEER - USA

[In a previous posting (Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, deer - USA
(WI) 20020926.5403) the moderator commented: "Clinical EHD has already
been reported this year, from Virginia, Ohio, and North Carolina. Because,
reportedly, low to nil EHD seroprevalence is seen in the northwest,
Midwest, and northeastern USA, laboratory confirmation of the Wisconsin
cases, and further data on the alleged Nebraska cases, seem to be required.
Such information, as well as further evaluations of the current geographic
distribution of orbiviruses and their vectors in North America, will be
welcomed." The responses to the request for information in North America
are below. - Mod.TG]

White-tails (WT) [deer] can be quite susceptible, but it sometimes varies
by geography. There was a nice paper out of Georgia recently that compared
the Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) susceptibility of Texas WT deer to
that of Pennsylvania WT deer. The Texas [deer] were quite resistant to
challenge, while the Pennsylvania deer were quite susceptible. I think
that article was in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases. We know that the
western 3/4 of Texas is endemic for both BTV [Blue tongue virus] and EHDV
(Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus). The piney woods [area] is the
exception.
I think the difference in Texas is the vector, which may or may not be _C.
variapennis_. In the western 3/4 of Texas, BTV and EHDV are highly
endemic. Fawns get inoculated every August, and they either survive (with
acquired immunity) or they don't. The piney woods has epizootic outbreaks.
BTV/EHDV are the prime reasons why Texas deer breeders are reluctant to
import "northern" white-tailed deer for breeding (importation of semen has
supplanted the need for bringing in a male) -- the deer have a low rate of
survival in the first year.

The reality is that we have not seen any indication of BTV or EHDV
infection in deer from the Northeastern US (New York and north), and
serologic results from cattle support this. New Jersey seems to be the
upper limit in the East (EHDV), and we have seen some very sporadic
outbreaks into Indiana, Illinois, etc. (again EHDV). In the Midwest,
outbreaks do follow the distribution of _C. sonorensis_, but seem to extend
a little more to the north (may be seasonal distribution extensions or a
lot of other things, and it would not be wise to draw a line in the sand --
the reported distributions of vector and disease are close enough). Most of
what we have seen in this area has been related to EHDV-2 (we do get some
BTVs mixed in especially as you move west). Herd immunity in these areas,
as you would expect with sporadic activity and mortality associated with
infection, is generally very low.
The susceptibility paper came out of our lab (Joe Gaydos did the work but I
don't think it is in print yet). There were extreme differences in how
these white-tailed deer subspecies handled experimental challenge. This
was demonstrated with both EHDV-1 and EHDV-2. The work was done to try to
explain the enzootic stability that exists in places such as Texas (the
statement regarding the distribution of these viruses in Texas is
correct). To make a long story short, both groups of deer were susceptible
to infection (developed a high viremia) but Pennsylvania deer died and
Texas deer did not. The field cases we get from Texas support this -- 95
percent of the time they are imported northern deer.
Our best guess is that there 2 things going on that influence the degree of
mortality and morbidity associated with these outbreaks (herd immunity and
innate immunity). Which is more important probably relates to where you
are. Problems generally occur in areas such as the upper midwest, where
deer seldom see these viruses (lack of herd immunity). In the other
extreme, where they are challenged on an annual basis, we may have a very
good example of co-evolution between host and these viruses (development of
innate immunity). I would suspect that there are all sorts of variations
on this theme going on in between.
We are getting many white-tailed deer submissions from the Southeast this
year. Lots of EHDV-2 isolates with a dash of BTV-10.
