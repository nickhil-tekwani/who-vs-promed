Three children -- aged 6 years old, 2 years old, and 14 months old -- died due to suspected food poisoning in Kolamguda village in Adilabad district on Wednesday [8 May 2019]. The police said that 22 people, including children, were undergoing treatment at a hospital after they displayed symptoms of food poisoning.

The villagers allegedly consumed some stale mutton curry at a marriage party on Tuesday [7 May 2019] and started complaining of vomiting and giddiness. The 3 children, who also had consumed the "stale" food, were declared dead by hospital authorities, while the condition of the 22 others was stable, the police said. A case was registered, and an investigation is on. ITDA PO Krishna Aditya and Utnoor DSP B David Yesudas and others visited the deceased at Utnoor Government Hospital.

[It is not stated what the incubation period was between the meal and the start of symptoms. It is certainly possible that a chemical poisoning of the meat or something else at the wedding gathering was the cause rather than an infection or bacterial toxin. - Mod.LL
