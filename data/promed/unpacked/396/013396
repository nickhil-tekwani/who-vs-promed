Since the beginning of 2021, Ituri province in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reported a total of 117 suspected cases of bubonic and pulmonary plague and 13 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR]: 11.1%) from 8 health zones. In Fataki health zone in the province, where plague has not been seen in at least 10 years, a total of 37 cases of bubonic and pulmonary plague with 12 deaths (CFR: 32.4%) [have been reported].

Plague is endemic to the northeast areas of the DRC, where cases were reported for the 1st time in 1928. The endemic nature of the disease in this region is linked to more cases in the rainy seasons (from March-May, then July-November), harvest seasons, and its peri-forest environment leading to the presence of peri-domestic rodents that can carry the plague bacillus and rodent fleas that transmit plague.

According to country reports, an average of 114 cases were reported between 2013 and 2020, [with] an upsurge in cases and geographical extensions increasingly noted since 2019. The most cases reported during these years was in 2020, [when] the total of number of cases reached more than 450.

[Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea, causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a bubo. Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. The bacteremia can also occur as an initial event. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. It is the pneumonic form of infection that can spread by the airborne route. - Mod.LL
