Vietnam and Cambodia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 8
-------------------------------------------------------------
First Cambodian Human Case of Infection With A (H5) Avian Influenza Virus
confirmed
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has today reported one further
laboratory confirmed case of human infection with H5 avian influenza. The
25-year-old woman was from Kampot Province in Cambodia, where she developed
respiratory symptoms on 21 Jan 2005. She sought medical care in
neighbouring Viet Nam on 27 Jan 2005 and died in Kien Giang Provincial
hospital in Viet Nam on 30 Jan 2005. Tests undertaken at the Pasteur
Institute, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam on 1 Feb 2005 were positive for
influenza A/H5. She is the first human case of H5 infection reported from
Cambodia.
A joint mission of the Cambodian Ministries of Health and of Agriculture
and of WHO is in Kampot Province, investigating the circumstances
surrounding this case.

[I am indebted to Jody Lanard M.D. for pointing out an error in my
Moderator's Comment to the preceding post in this thread (Avian influenza,
human - East Asia (25): Viet Nam ex Cambodia 20050201.0345. This was due
to my mis-reading of the press report. My comment should have read that:
"It is likely that 2 (not 3) members of a Cambodian family have contracted
avian influenza from an outbreak of avian influenza in a region of Cambodia
close to the border with Viet Nam. Both (not all 3) died and the eldest who
was treated in a hospital in Viet Nam is reported to have tested H5N1 virus
positive." The above statement from WHO confirms that death of the eldest
can be attributed to Avian influenza A (H5) virus infection. - Mod.CP]

Viet Nam: Another Human Case of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Vietnam reported another avian influenza infection on Wed 2 Feb 2005 in an
outbreak that has killed 13 people over the past month, a doctor said. A
24-year-old man from Hanoi was admitted to the city's Bach Mai hospital on
25 Jan 2005 with a high fever and cough before testing positive for the
H5N1 serotype of the virus, said the hospital doctor on condition of
anonymity. The doctor said the man had been removed from a respirator and
was recovering.
The latest infection suggests the disease is resurging after an outbreak
last year spread to 10 Asian countries, forcing the slaughter of more than
100 million birds. The biggest concern is that the virus may mutate into a
form easily spread from person-to-person, potentially sparking a pandemic.
Most cases so far have been traced to sick poultry and there is no evidence
that the disease has altered.
On Tue 1 Feb 2005, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization and the World
Animal Health Organization warned that the region was especially vulnerable
to the spread of avian influenza after the 26 Dec 2004 tsunami -- with
concerns that infected poultry could be delivered to survivors in countries
battered by killer waves. "The battle against bird flu can only be won if
more efforts and resources are directed to containment of the virus in
animals in rural areas," the agencies said in a joint statement.
Avian influenza has jumped to humans in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia,
where a total of 45 people have died since the beginning of last year.
There have been 16 bird flu cases in Viet Nam alone since 30 Dec 2004, 12
of which were fatal. On Tue 1 Feb 2005, Hanoi reported that a 25-year-old
woman from neighboring Cambodia who died Sunday in a Vietnamese hospital
tested positive for bird flu -- the 1st Cambodian to succumb to the
disease. Cambodia's health minister Nuth Sokhom and World Health
Organization medical adviser Paul Weelen inspected several villages
southwestern Cambodia, where the woman lived, to get firsthand knowledge of
the disease. "We need to map out what has been happening over the past
weeks with the spread of the virus, whether we can find out what has been
going on," Weelen said.
An international conference on bird flu will be held in Ho Chi Minh City
later this month, a follow up to last year's meeting in Bangkok.

Viet Nam: Another Human Avian influenza Case: Confirmation Pending
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Vietnam reported a 24-year-old man from capital Hanoi, who was hospitalized
on 25 Jan 2005, was infected with avian influenza virus H5N1, raising the
total number of bird flu infections in the country since late December 2004
to 17, a local doctor told Xinhua on Wed 2 Feb 2005. According to initial
testing by the National Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute, samples from
our 24-year-old patient were tested positive to H5N1. However, we have yet
to receive the result in written document," said Nguyen Hong Ha, head of
the treatment team from the Hanoi-based Tropical Disease Institute.
The man, who needed respiratory assistance after being admitted to the
Tropical Disease Institute, is now recovering rapidly. The institute is
treating a total of 9 patients, including 3 H5N1 carriers. 2 carriers are
scheduled to be discharged on 7 Feb 2005, local doctors said, noting that 6
suspected cases are waiting for testing results from the National Hygiene
and Epidemiology Institute.
The European Commission, on Tue 1 Feb 2005, pledged to offer Vietnam 600
000 euros [nearly 788 000 US dollars] for the country's purchase of
first-aid and experiment equipment to deal with human bird flu infections.
Ho Chi Minh City plans to exempt hospital fees for bird flu victims, since
daily treatment costs each patient up to 2-3 million Vietnamese dong [127
to 191 dollars]. In a move to curb the spread of bird flu, the municipal
authorities have already decided to stop raising fowls, including fighting
cocks, in its urban districts from 6 Feb 2005, and to halt the raising of
ducks city-wide for one year from 7 Feb 2005 after turning live ducks into
frozen meat and culling affected ones.
Avian influenza, since January [2005], has stricken 33 out of 64 cities and
provinces in Vietnam, killing and leading to the forced culling of nearly
1.2 million poultry, according to the country's Department of Animal
Health. The disease has hit 17 local people, of whom 12 have died, since
late December 2004.
On Tue 1 Feb 2005, a virologist from the Pasteur Institute in Vietnam's Ho
Chi Minh City told Xinhua that a 25-year old Cambodian woman, who died on
30 Jan 2005 in Vietnam, was infected with H5N1 virus. The woman, who lived
in Cambodia's Kampot province adjacent to Vietnam's southern Kien Giang
province, was admitted to the provincial hospital of Kien Giang on 28 Jan 2005.
