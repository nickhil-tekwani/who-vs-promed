4th case of mad cow disease found in Japan
------------------------------------------
TOKYO: A test in Hokkaido found Saturday that a slaughtered cow was
infected with mad cow disease -- the fourth such result since September,
when the first case in Japan was detected, the health ministry said.
The outcome of the more precise test at the Obihiro University of
Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine in Hokkaido followed a preliminary test
Friday in which the 6-year-old female Holstein cow also tested positive for
the brain-wasting illness.

Japan Reports Fourth Case of Mad Cow Disease
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TOKYO: Tests on Saturday confirmed another case of mad cow
disease in Japan, the first since November and the fourth since an outbreak
last September that devastated the country's food sector and battered
consumer confidence. The Health Ministry said tests at a university in
Hokkaido, northern Japan, had confirmed a preliminary positive test for the
brain-wasting illness.
It said the case was still pending final determination by a panel of
experts, which would make an announcement on Monday.
Formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), mad cow disease
has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has killed
about 100 people in Europe but none in Japan.
The outbreak has gutted Japan's appetite for beef, battered the earnings of
food companies and restaurants, and damaged the faith of consumers in the
country's food-safety standards.
Satoshi Takaya, director of the health ministry's food safety division,
told reporters the six-year old Holstein cow that had tested positive had
come from a dairy farm on Hokkaido island.
Since October, Japan has tested all the cows slaughtered for beef for the
disease.
The Farm Ministry said last month that it estimated the total industry-wide
damage of BSE at up to 2.95 billion Dollars but the report of the new case
comes at a time when there were signs that confidence in beef was returning.
The latest case comes just four weeks before thousands of visitors are due
to arrive in Japan for the World Cup soccer tournament, which it is
co-hosting with South Korea. South Korea has its own problems, confirming
last week another outbreak of foot and mouth disease in its pig population.
That disease is considered harmless for humans, but threatens nevertheless
to damage consumer confidence.
Cattle are believed to contract mad cow disease by eating meat-and-bone
meal contaminated with BSE, but officials have not pinned down the source
of the outbreak in Japan.
An investigating panel last month slammed the government for ignoring
warnings from both the World Health Organization and the European
Commission that could have prevented the crisis.
Japan's total beef imports are expected to hit 506 000 tonnes this year,
down 25 percent from 2001. Most imports come from the United States,
although Australia is also a major supplier.
The weighted average price of domestic beef on the Tokyo Meat Market hit
6.54 Dollars per kg this week -- a significant recovery from lows plumbed
in September, but well off levels before the first outbreak on 10 Sep 2002.

[All four cases of BSE in Japan -- the current one as well as the previous
three -- have occurred in dairy farms on the island Hokkaido. There have
been several opinions about the source of infection, including milk
replacers of European origin (see ProMED-mail posting "BSE - Japan: source
