Almeria almond production fell 70 percent
-----------------------------------------
The province's almond production has fallen by 70 percent. The dire
predictions of the UPA-Almeria [union of small scale growers] have
been fulfilled, and "the harvest is only 30 percent of a normal year."
Among the causes [are] frost preventing proper flowering and the
appearance of fungi. UPA said that "farmers have been forced to reduce
costs and apply a minimum treatment to trees." A farmer explained,
"the late almond [blossom] froze and then fungi wiped out
everything."

Along with the sharp reduction in production, the fall in profit is
because of "poor quality, and the fruit has very little weight.
Farmers will not even cover costs." UPA lamented that "we have been in
crisis for 4 years" and "no one does anything." The almond production
sector has suffered several campaigns with low prices, lower
production, and a continuous increase in production costs.

[Almond (_Prunus dulcis_), like other stone fruit (_Prunus_ species),
can be affected by a range of fungal pathogens. Stone fruit crops have
many pathogens in common, but it is not stated above whether other
crops in this group are also affected in the region. Trees stressed by
environmental factors, for example by frost and poor maintenance as
described for the almond orchards above, may be more susceptible to
infections and/or symptoms of pathogens may become more obvious.

Disease management of fungal pathogens in orchards may include
cultural practices to improve tree vigour, phytosanitation to reduce
pathogen reservoirs and disease spread, and timely fungicide
applications. Reliable diagnosis of the fungal species involved in the
problems in Almeria would be needed to enable more specific and
effective disease control.
