re: ProMED-mail Heartworm, canine - Canada 20091012.3522
--------------------------------------------------------
A similar phenomenon to that suggested for Canada in relation to the
Louisiana dogs was reputed to have occurred in Australia in the mid 1970s
in association with the movement of pet dogs from Darwin in the immediate
aftermath of the devastation caused to Darwin by tropical cyclone Tracy in
1974.

Legend at the time had it that relocation of dogs from Darwin was linked to
coincidentally rapid increases in the diagnosed incidence of canine
heartworm disease in and around Alice Springs (in dry central Australia),
Adelaide, and Melbourne in southern Australia, and possibly early locally
indigenous cases in the Perth area of Western Australia.

To my knowledge the legendary link was never proven with any certainty, and
given the then state of HWD [heartworm disease] clinical diagnostic options
relative to present day (clinical signs + microfilariae in blood or quite
astute interpretation of thoracic X-rays), increased incidence then could
easily have been attributed to advances in veterinary awareness and
clinical diagnostic skills, and/or to a generally increasing trend in human
and related pet mobility between endemically affected areas of the east and
north and the cooler, previously 'clean' (or much less affected) areas of
the red centre, south, and south-west.

In addition to the treatment regimes identified by the moderator within
ProMED-mail post 20091012.3522, particularly for cases demonstrating
clinical signs of cardiopulmonary disease, the therapeutic regime probably
should also include a period of treatment with aspirin and corticosteroids
(such as prednisolone) prior to melarsomine treatment. This serves to
reduce the incidence of ongoing thromboembolism (aspirin) and reduce
pulmonary and intravascular inflammation within the pulmonary arteries and
lungs (prednisolone), thereby increasing functional lung capacity, reducing
congestive pulmonary arterial blood pressure, reducing the impact of
thromboembolism that can be expected with adulticide therapy, and
increasing treatment safety margins quite significantly. Depending on the
severity of the clinical cardiopulmonary insufficiency initially presented,
it may be necessary to maintain aspirin/prednisolone therapy for 6 weeks or
possibly longer (preferably on a decreasing plane of prednisolone dosage to
safeguard against development of adrenocortical insufficiency/induced
Cushing's syndrome) before commencing adulticide therapy.

I must also say that the modern therapeutic regimes are vastly superior to
earlier ones involving adulticide treatment using Caparsolate or
progressively higher oral dosages of levamisole. Intravenous Caparsolate
had a low safety margin, particularly in dogs that had liver insufficiency
secondary to congestive heart disease, and it was also not tremendously
effective. Levamisole was not as effective either, and levamisole
intolerance occurred very frequently as a side effect. The neurological
aspects of levamisole intolerance were quite distressing sequelae for
owners and cases alike to have to endure.

[Dr Thomson's account of the situation in Australia mirrors the situation
in Canada, with the exception of a few years of advancements in treatments.

In addition to treatments mentioned above, it may also be prudent to treat
with oral ivermectin 3 to 4 months prior to the adulticide melarsomine
dihydrochloride being given. This regiment has been shown to decrease
circulating microfilariae that the adulticide would have missed. Clearly
microfilariae progress through various stages and some of those stages are
susceptible to filaricide and some may not be mature enough to be
susceptible to the adulticide but are too mature for the filaricide. So the
protocol of treating with oral ivermectin 3-4 months prior to an adulticide
decreases the number of intermediates that are not adults or filarial. -
