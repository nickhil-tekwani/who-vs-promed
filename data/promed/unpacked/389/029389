The Health Authorities confirm that the situation in Benakuma Health District in the Menchum Division is under control. Following the measles outbreak in the North West Region, especially in Benakuma Health District in the Menchum Division, which has so far has claimed the lives of 9 children, the Governor of the North West Region, Adolphe Lele L'Afrique, has ordered a health team to remain on the field for case management and continuous sensitisation to arrest the epidemic.

According to Dr. Sama Julius, the Head of the Regional Expanded Programme on Immunization, EPI, Unit, ever since the first 2 deaths were recorded in Benakuma some weeks ago, they have been burning the midnight oil to keep measles at bay. He said after health investigations, the results of which were established on 10 Jul 2015, there have been 7 more deaths; increasing the number of deaths to 9, all in Benakuma Health District. He said their findings also revealed that there were 148 measles cases in Benakuma. Against this backdrop and with instructions of the Governor, a health team has been stationed there to manage the situation. Dr Sama Julius was quick to add that so far, they are vaccinating children from 9 months to 10 years in Benakuma and its environs so as to protect them from measles. He said they have organised a mini-vaccination campaign in 8 villages in the Benakuma Health District. They are Banum, Banahundu, Bosong, Akereru, Ebereogu, Ekura and Eyenge. He assured all that the situation was under control, but blamed the outbreak on non-adherence to routine vaccination. Against this backdrop, health officials are calling on parents to take their children from 9 months for vaccination against measles. It should be recalled that the measles outbreak has hit 11 out of the 19 health districts in the North West Region.

[The modern state of Cameroon was created in 1961 by the unification of 2 former colonies, 1 British and 1 French. Since then it has struggled from 1-party rule to a multi-party system in which the freedom of expression is severely limited. Cameroon began its independence with a bloody insurrection which was suppressed only with the help of French forces. Nonetheless, Cameroon saw investment in agriculture, education, health care and transport. Cameroon has 1 of the highest literacy rates in Africa.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating a possible case of measles in Barrington, according to the Rhode Island Department of Health (HEALTH). "A doctor reported the case," said HEALTH PIO Andrea Bagnall Degos on Friday. "The time to confirm or rule out the case depends on the results of bloodwork from the CDC, which we expect to have next week but there is no firm deadline. Right now we are considering it a 'probable' case."

"The people who were exposed and vaccinated will self-monitor and report any fever or illness to us for a period of 21 days after the initial, potential exposure. 7 children under 1 year old were exposed." Degos said that health professionals have been working on the case since Tuesday.

"A team of public health nurses, epidemiologists, and laboratorians have been working on the response since the report on Tuesday [July] 21st," said Degos. "The CDC is involved."

According to the CDC's Measles page, "On 2 Jul 2015, Washington State Department of Health confirmed a measles-related death. The last reported measles infection that resulted in death in the U.S. was in 2003."

Parents of children who attended music class in Barrington were alerted on Tuesday that a possible exposure in an email.

Despite a decline in measles cases in the first half of 2015, the epidemic situation in the whole of the Moscow District remains dire. Specialists say that this year the District recorded 15 cases of the disease, compared within 37 cases in the District in 2014.

Rospotrebnadzor [the Health and Welfare Organisation] warned that the spread of measles is due to the infection of unvaccinated children or unvaccinated adults who remain susceptible to the disease. Also vulnerable are children of the 1st year of life, born to unvaccinated mothers. Also vulnerable are are organised groups of adults living in dormitories. At risk of measles include organized groups and persons living in the dorms, especially visitors from abroad who may have not been vaccinated. Previously in early June 2015 a family of 4 contracted measles within a 4-day period. The family comprised 2 adults and 2 children. The source of infection was 1 of the children who had not been vaccinated due to an oversight by the mother.

Vaccination in Russia carried out in accordance with the national calendar of preventive vaccinations. According to epidemic indications, vaccination is required for all contacts with persons with measles symptoms or those who had received only a single vaccination. Measles vaccine is available in sufficient quantities in all Health Department Clinics in Moscow.

In recent years, measles cases have been imported from foreign countries (1 from Thailand, 1 from Hong Kong and 1 from South Korea), as well as a single case imported from the city of Moscow. In 2014 imported cases of measles came from the Philippines and Hong Kong, followed by the spread of infections among residents of Ussuriysk. In contrast during 2015, no cases of measles were recorded throughout the Primorsky Territory.

Measles is highly contagious infectious disease-producing pathogen transmitted from a sick person to a susceptible individual (without a history of measles and are not vaccinated against measles) through the air (talking, coughing, sneezing, etc.). Measles virus is volatile and and can remain infectious for some time in discharged mucus. Clinical manifestations of measles in the typical course of the disease is marked by cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, general intoxication, temperature 38 deg C and above, stepwise maculo-papular rashes with 4-5th day of illness (day 1 - the face, neck, 2nd day - the body; day 3 - legs, arms) and pigmentation [rash].

The source of an outbreak is usually a sick person who is in the incubation period of the disease (for 8-10 days before the onset of symptoms) and up to the end of this period until the rash ends. So with measles cases (suspected cases) the sick person should be isolated from others, without a history of measles and previously or not immunized against this infection (found in an infectious diseases hospital or in the community), which will not disappear until the last elements of the rash finally recede. A recovered patient should not return to work until all symptoms have disappeared.

The main preventive measure at the present stage of measles is vaccination, which is held in the Russian Federation in accordance with the national calendar of preventive vaccinations in children 1 year and 6 years and adolescents aged 15-17 years and adults aged up to 35 years (inclusive), if they have not had measles or been vaccinated against the infection, or they have no information about prior vaccination against measles.

Particular attention is given to measles immunization among people of "risk groups", which include students of higher and secondary educational institutions, recruits, medical workers, employees of educational institutions, trade, transport, as well as citizens belonging to migrant workers, refugees and displaced people, nomadic groups, members of religious communities.
