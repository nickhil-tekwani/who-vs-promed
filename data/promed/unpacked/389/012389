The Chilean National Fishing Service (SERNAPESCA, according to its
Spanish initials) confirmed the presence of the HPR2 variant of the
infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus in 3 cages located in a
fish-culture area in the Aysen Region. This variant causes low
mortality rates and mild signs in Atlantic Ocean salmon, a species
known to be quite susceptible for developing this condition.

The HPR2 outbreak was found in 3 of the 16 cages of the aforementioned
fish culturing center, according to laboratory tests ordered by
SERNAPESCA. From the positive result found, the 'Ballena 3' center was
incorporated into the list of sites with confirmed cultures. According
with regulations issued by the ISA Specific Sanitary Surveillance and
Control Program, SERNAPESCA decided to eliminate salmons from positive
cages, complying with the current schedules and biosafety
regulations.

Interviewed sources from the salmon industry explained that this
particular strain is less virulent compared to HPRO, a strain that
between 2007 and 2011 caused a severe sanitary, labor, and financial
crisis due to high mortality rates in affected fish. They also pointed
out that the early detection of this outbreak indicates the system is
working correctly.

Then, 2 weeks ago, SERNAPESCA confirmed the presence of a new virus --
HSMI -- in fresh water fish in 10 sea fishing areas in this country.
According to performed studies, salmons did not develop the disease
and no mortality was reported.

HSMI leads to inflammation of skeletal and cardiac muscle, and it has
also been identified in Norway.

[Another outbreak, or a continuing outbreak of this disease is very
difficult for the farms as well as anyone in an allied industry that
helps support this industry. Let's hope they get it under control
soon, and that may occur as it is a less virulent form of the disease.
