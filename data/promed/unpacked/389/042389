A total of 30 cases of cholera were detected last week in the provinces of
Arequipa and Camana according to the Regional Directorate of the Ministry of
Health. There has been a significant increase in cases of cholera in the
last two months in the area around Arequipa such as the districts of La
Joya, Tiabaya, Socabaya, Paucarpata, and Mariano Melgar, as well as the
province of Camana. For the year, there have been 97 cases reported.
Most of the patients are between 25 and 35 years of age and children are the
next largest group.
The principal sources of the infection have been unboiled water that is
consumed by most residents of the outlying villages, as well as food sold by
street vendors. Also, there appears to be a lack of proper hygiene in some
families.
Spokesmen for the Regional Directorate of Health indicated that in parallel
with treatment of the most severe cases, they are pursuing a program of
prevention as well as educating the residents above all those who lack water
and sewage service.

[We see so much cholera in underdeveloped parts of the world. The story is
always the same; poor sanitation, contaminated food products, lack of
education of the populace, health ministers expressing frustration at the
publics failure to comply with recommendations. Let's hear from the experts
about their view of what can be done to have the most immediate impact on
the incidence of cholera worldwide. - Mod.ES
