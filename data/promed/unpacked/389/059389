Cocoyam [taro] farmers in Katsina state have expressed concern over how, for almost a decade now, leaf blight disease has been hindering large scale production of the crop. Persisted leaf blight disease has made many shy away from cultivation of cocoyam. Farmers on their own have tried different remedies but all in vain. The crop is fast coming to extinction in the markets as its supply is very poor in comparison with the last 15 years.

An agriculture worker said the disease requires strategic intervention of both government and the private agricultural companies. "Farmers need to be supplied with new improved seeds [tubers] because the recycling of infected seeds leads to build up of leaf blight and reduction of yield. The mode of propagation enhances transmission from one generation to the next, that is why the impact of the disease moved beyond one season. It is not encouraging how farmers are virtually left to their own devices over the years concerning the disease."

[Taro (_Colocasia esculenta_) leaf blight caused by the oomycete (fungus-like organism) _Phytophthora colocasiae_ was first reported in Java in the early 1900s. Since then, it was found in various parts of Asia and the Pacific, and in 2010, it was reported for the 1st time from Africa (see ProMED-mail post 20100715.2365). Both leaves and tubers of the crop are used, and taro blight results in yield losses of 30-50 per cent or even total crop losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the harvest.

Symptoms include purple-brown water-soaked lesions on leaves oozing a clear yellow liquid; lesions enlarge and eventually destroy entire leaves in 10-20 days, leading to reduced photosynthesis and plant vigour. Disease development and spread are favoured by free water collecting on older leaves, high temperatures and high humidity. The pathogen can be spread by wind, splashing rain and mechanical means (including insects and human activities). Spores survive in plant material for several weeks and, therefore, infected planting material (seed tubers) is a common means of pathogen spread over long distances and between seasons.

Varying levels of disease intensity in different areas have led to the suggestion that different strains of _P. colocasiae_ may exist, in addition to differences in the genetic background of local taro varieties. Some of these strains appear to be able to infect some other aroid crops (for example _Alocasia_ species) as well, but further information is needed on whether non-aroid crops like yam (_Dioscorea_ species) and cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) could be affected by these pathogens.

Disease management using an integrated approach has been successful in the Pacific, including cultural methods (such as crop rotation, intercropping), fungicides as sprays or treatments for seed tubers, phytosanitation and use of cultivars with reduced levels of susceptibility. Programmes specific to different areas for the assessment of taro blight resistance levels of local cultivars have been set up by some countries.

In Nigeria, a resistance breeding programme has been established in 2011 by the National Root Crops Research Institute (see ProMED-mail post 20110422.1253). However, according to the report above it appears that no improved varieties have been made available to farmers so far.
