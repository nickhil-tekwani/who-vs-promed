[LSD continues its spread in southwest direction, now present in 2 northeastern provinces of Greece and the Aegean island of Lemnos.

Outbreak summary:
Total outbreaks = 81 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 4804 / 438 / 18 / 4786 / 0

The most recent reported outbreak started 19 Oct 2015. The circulation of the virus is expected to slow down when temperatures
decrease.

The northeastern regions of Greece border Bulgaria, where alertness is, reportedly, been applied.

During the 1st LSD outbreaks in southern Africa, in the early 1940's, it was observed that isolated outbreaks occurred in widely scattered herds, without a known contact, and in the absence of cattle movements. These outbreaks were associated with wet and warm weather conditions, with an abundance of blood-feeding arthropod populations, and it was not possible to control the spread of the disease effectively by quarantine measures. Currently, it is widely agreed that LSDV is transmitted mechanically via arthropod vectors while introduction of infected animals into susceptible populations should obviously be prevented. Iatrogenic spread (such as via the re-use of injectors by vaccinators, etc.) has been documented. Stable flies are a common mechanical vector. Recently, new evidence has been published reporting a possible role for hard ticks in the transmission of LSDV. - Mod.AS
