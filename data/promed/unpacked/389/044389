[This looks like a repeat of the previous outbreak in this Kenyan county in 2014 -- see link in the See Also section below for our previous posting. A more complete report of this incident is available at https://www.theglobaldispatch.com/kenya-three-dead-in-kakamega-after-consuming-anthrax-infected-meat-55240/

While relatively common in other parts of Kenya, anthrax is rarely reported in humans or animals in Western Province, though it must exist there to have produced these cases. It is not high in public or veterinary awareness, and thus the price being paid by these careless individuals. While the incubation period is usually from 3-4 days, enteric exposure to a high dose can kill in hours. - Mod.MHJ
