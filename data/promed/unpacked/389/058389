[1] ConAgra voluntary recall

ConAgra Foods announced today, 11 Oct 2007, that it is continuing its
efforts to ensure consumer safety by voluntarily recalling all varieties of
Banquet brand frozen pot pies and all varieties of store brand frozen pot
pies sold under the names of Albertson's, Hill Country Fare, Food Lion,
Great Value, Kirkwood, Kroger, Meijer and Western Family.

Earlier this week, ConAgra Foods was contacted by state health officials
regarding concerns that some of its Banquet poultry pot pie products may be
linked to an outbreak of salmonellosis. In cooperation with the American
Department of Agriculture (USDA), on 9 Oct 2007, ConAgra Foods directed
retailers to remove the poultry pot pies from shelves, suspended pot pie
production in its Marshall, MO, plant and advised consumers to not eat
these products and discard these products while an investigation was conducted.

As that investigation continues, ConAgra Foods today voluntarily issued the
recall to ensure the utmost clarity for consumers about the fact that they
should not eat these products. In addition, to avoid any confusion on pot
pie varieties, ConAgra Foods has simplified the recall to include all
Banquet and store brand pot pie varieties, as listed above and at the end
of this release. As conveyed earlier this week, ConAgra Foods reminds
consumers that these products are not ready-to-eat. Before the product
returns to market, the company will revise on-package cooking directions to
provide additional clarity on proper preparation by consumers. Proper
cooking of all not-ready-to-eat products, including pot pies, is
specifically designed to eliminate the presence of common pathogens found
in many uncooked products.

The recall includes all Banquet pot pie varieties, including poultry and
beef. The store brand not-ready-to-eat pot pie products include all
varieties under the following brand names:
- Albertson's (sold at Albertson's);
- Hill Country Fare (sold at HEB);
- Food Lion (sold at Food Lion);
- Great Value (sold at Wal-Mart);
- Kirkwood (sold at Aldi);
- Kroger (sold at Kroger);
- Meijer (sold at Meijer);
- Western Family (now discontinued; previously sold at a variety of small
retailers).

[2] CDC update
Date: Thu 11 Oct 2007 Source: CDC [edited] <http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/4512eyeminus.html>

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating with public health
officials in multiple states across the United States and with the US Department of
Agriculture Food Safety Inspection Service to investigate an ongoing multi-state
outbreak of Salmonella I 4,[5],12:i:- (pronounced ?four five twelve eye minus?)
infections in humans. An investigation that used interviews comparing foods eaten by ill
and well persons is showing that eating Banquet brand pot pies produced by the ConAgra
Foods company is the likely source of the illness.

Between 1 Jan 2007 and 11 Oct 2007, at least 165 isolates of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:-
with an indistinguishable genetic fingerprint have been collected from ill persons in 31
states. Ill persons whose salmonella strain has this genetic fingerprint have been
reported from Arizona (1 person), California (6), Connecticut (3), Delaware (5), Georgia
(2), Idaho (6), Illinois (5), Indiana (3), Kansas (2), Kentucky (8), Massachusetts (5),
Maryland (5), Maine (1), Michigan (3), Minnesota (6), Missouri (13), Montana (4), Nevada
(6), New York (8), Ohio (8), Oklahoma (1), Oregon (2), Pennsylvania (13), Tennessee (5),
Texas (4), Utah (2), Virginia (6), Vermont (2), Washington (8), Wisconsin (20), Wyoming
(2). Their ages range from less than 1 to 87 years with a median age of 20 years; 51 per
cent of ill persons are female. At least 30 people have been hospitalized. No deaths
have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
The CDC is coordinating a case-control study designed to identify the source of these
infections. A case was defined as salmonella infection on or after 1 Aug 2007, with a
strain that had the outbreak genetic fingerprint. Reverse address directories were used
to enroll control persons, who were matched to cases by age group and state of
residence. Eating a Banquet brand pot pie was significantly associated with illness. The
outbreak appears to be ongoing.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
At this time, the CDC recommends that people do not eat any Banquet pot pies or pot pies
made by ConAgra Foods that have a printed code beginning in "5009" and ending in "P9"
or "Est 1059." Other brands of pot pies made in the ConAgra Foods factory that makes
Banquet brand pot pies and sold under other brand names may also be contaminated with
_Salmonella_. These other pot pie boxes also have a printed code ending in "P9" or "Est
1059." If you have any of these products at home, the safest thing to do is to discard
them. US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service Public Health

[As readers will note from past outbreaks of salmonellosis, the specific organism
involved is usually referred to as _Salmonella enterica_ followed by its serotype (or
servar) name such as _S. enterica_ serotype Tennessee. Serotype Tennessee was associated
with the recent USA-wide peanut butter-associated outbreak affected more than 600
people.

As discussed by Ana Paccagnella (supervisor of the Enteric Bacteriology Section at the
British Columbia Centre for Disease Control),
<http://www.bcfpa.net/Attachments/Presentations/Conference2005/Naming%20Salmonella%20(A%20Paccagnella)%2008%20Nov%2005.pdf>,

_Salmonella_ as a genus has 2 species, _enterica_ and _bongori_. _S. enterica_ is
divided into 6 subspecies: _enterica_, _salamae_, _arizonae_, _diarizonae_, _houtenae_
and _indica_. _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ (or subspecies I) strains are the ones
usually isolated from humans or warm-blooded animals and represent a majority of the
salmonellas that are clinically important.

The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism; It
should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5 and 12 (the
Group B antigens). Paccagnella pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen
underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage
conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflect the flagellar or H
antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual
group of salmonellas.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they
can switch from 1 flagellar antigen to another. As an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4,
5, 12:i:1,2. The outbreak organism here, however, is monophasic. Echeita and colleagues
(1) have found that this monophasic strain appears to be such due to the absence of the
_flj_B gene which is involved in the H antigen switching mechanism. According to
Paccagnella, around 1903 Smith and Reagh reported on the different behavior of the
flagellar and somatic antigens of salmonella strains. Their work was mostly ignored
until Weil and Felix, working on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2 forms, the swarming form
called the H form (_mit Hauch_, in English: with breath] and the non-swarming form,
called the O form (_ohne Hauch_, in English: without breath). The H form contained both
O and H antigens (correctly termed the OH form). These parallels were transposed to the
salmonella antigens.

If O antiserum is added to a culture motility is preserved whereas if H antiserum is
added the culture does not move. Therefore, H antigen was involved with swarming in the
agar plate (breathing might have been used to imply the ability to move). (Salmonellas,
of course, do not swarm on certain agar plates like _Proteus_ do.)

Several other foodborne outbreaks related to 4, 5, 12:i:- salmonellas have been reported
including one in New York City reported in 2002 (2). Additional information about this
monophasic organism, which may be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, can be
found in references 3-5.
