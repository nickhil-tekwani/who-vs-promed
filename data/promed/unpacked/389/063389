CHICAGO -- Consumer products maker Sara Lee Corp. was cited as saying
today that it had added more brands to the list of packaged meat
products it recalled in December because of possible contamination by
Listeria.
The story says that while the foodservice operators stopped using the
Sara Lee products at the restaurants, hospitals and other venues they
serve, they may have sold them at outlet stores before the recall date.
Sara Lee spokeswoman Theresa Herlevsen was cited as saying the
additional recalled brands total about 200 000 pounds of meat, and that
it expects to recover a total of about 15 million pounds of meat in the
massive recall.
The additional brands being recalled were sold by Grand Rapids,
Mich.-based Gordon Food Service, which operates about 70 stores; Allen
Foods, which has one outlet store in St. Louis; Sara Lee's PYA Monarch
foodservice unit, which runs two stores in Montgomery, Ala.; and a Bil
Mar Country Store outlet in Zeeland, Mich.

UPI 31 Jan 1999 [edited
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- To date, the deaths of 12 people, three
miscarriages, and more than 70 illnesses nationwide are blamed on
Listeria-tainted meat.
More than 15 million pounds of meat have been recalled since Sara Lee's
December announcement.
Dr. Paul Mead, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control was cited as... telling the Grand Rapids Press the CDC recall
recommendation came several days after an epidemiologist from the
Minnesota Health Department urged a recall, adding, "Recalls are always
either too early or too late. If you're right, it's always too late. If
you're wrong, it's always too early."
He was further cited as saying it's unclear whether an earlier recall
could have saved lives or prevented more illnesses.
He also noted that CDC investigators are trying to determine if dust at
the Bil-Mar plant may have led to the Listeria outbreak because
officials think there was a "construction event" in the building that
sprayed dust onto the equipment. The dust is suspected to have contained
Listeria, which is commonly found in soil and water.
[ProMED-mail often faces the same dilemma; do we post without
confirmation and risk having to retract, or wait for confirmation and
allow more cases to occur for lack of timely warning? So far, we have
only had to retract 3 minor outbreak reports out of several thousand
posted - Mod.JW

There are only 1000 to 2000 reported cases of listeriosis in the United
States each year; an accurate figure cannot be obtained, the story says,
as health professionals do not routinely test for it and many cases go
undetected.
But health officials find it especially troubling because, based on the
number of reported cases, the percentage of people who die from it is
much higher than from most other food-borne bacteria. And, the story
adds, the incubation period is much longer, up to 70 days before
symptoms appear.
In addition to causing miscarriages and stillbirths, Listeria can cause
fatal blood infections and meningitis.
American scientists began to take Listeria seriously in 1985, when 18
deaths were traced to the eating of Jalisco brand soft cheese. (The
company is now defunct.) There were also 30 stillbirths and deaths of
newborns.
Another 142 people became ill.
Listeria is carried in the intestines of animals and can easily come in
contact with dairy products, uncooked meats, fish, poultry and
vegetables as well as precooked meats like the ones responsible for the
August
outbreak. The investigators say they do not know how the Listeria
contaminated the cooked meats at Bil Mar Foods.
The centralization of food production has turned what might previously
have been a small local problem into a global one. Products from the Bil
Mar plant, for example, are distributed all over the United States.
In the Bil Mar Foods case, the Agriculture Department left the
announcement of the recall to the company. The agency does not announce
recalls until it has proof that a sealed product contains the
disease-causing bacteria, and it did not have that proof until 31 Dec
1998, nine days later.
When the company announced the recall, a spokesman for the Agriculture
Department, Andrew Solomon, was cited as saying that reporters who cover
the agency were notified and the information was put on the agency's Web
site and on its consumer-information line (800-535-4555).

Dale Morse, the director of the division of infectious disease of the
New York State Health Department, say there can never be enough
notification. In Broome County, in upstate New York [he said Meals on
Wheels was still serving the Bil Mar products to elderly clients eight
days after the recall, because it had not been notified.
The story goes on to say that unlike many other disease-causing
bacteria, Listeria can grow in a refrigerator that has a normal
temperature of 40 degrees, which means leftovers should be reheated.
Public health officials strongly urge those at greatest risk from
Listeria to stay away from all soft cheeses,
including feta and blue-veined cheeses like Roquefort and Camembert.
They also say that it is essential to cook hot dogs until the internal
temperature reaches 165 degrees, by either steaming or frying. Cooking
in the
microwave is not recommended. And unless people at risk are willing to
eat salami, corned beef and pastrami cooked. they should not eat them
at all.
