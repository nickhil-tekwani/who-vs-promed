Virulent footrot has been detected in Western Australia, with a ram imported from the eastern states testing positive to the reportable disease.

Key points:
- A ram infected with virulent footrot has been imported to WA [Western Australia].
- Footrot is a painful disease that causes sheep and goats to become lame, lose weight, and produce less wool.
- Authorities are tracing other animals that travelled with the infected ram.

The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) said the infected ram was identified through routine post-border inspections of sheep and goats entering WA from interstate.

The department said it was now tracing all of the sheep that travelled in the same truck as the infected ram. It said it had traced sheep to multiple properties across Western Australia and was testing sheep at those properties.

Footrot is a bacterial infection causing painful lesions in sheep and goats, making them lame, lose weight, and produce less wool. The contagious disease is classified as benign or virulent according to the severity of clinical signs caused in infected animals.

Prior to the incursion, the virulent strain was not present in Western Australia.

In a statement it said the property that received the animal was currently under a pest control notice, restricting movement of sheep and goats until the infection is eradicated.

It is understood that properties involved in the contact tracing have also been placed under quarantine notices. The department said it was not able to advise the location or number of properties affected.

Warm, moist conditions cause the bacteria to spread rapidly with lesions forming on the feet of infected animals.

In a statement, DPIRD said the producer with the infected ram had followed all the recommended biosecurity protocols, including keeping any imported animals separate from the home flock.

Currently 17 cents from the sale of every sheep and goat in Western Australia is used to fund biosecurity activities including the control of virulent footrot.

["Footrot (or _Dichelobacter nodosus_) is an infectious and contagious disease that can potentially cause lameness in your flock. Ovine (sheep) footrot has long been dreaded by sheep owners.

"Footrot of sheep and goats is a scheduled disease under disease control legislation. This means the following:

- Outbreaks of footrot must be notified to an inspector of livestock within 7 days;
- It is illegal to sell infected sheep or goats other than for slaughter;
- It is illegal to place footrot-infected sheep in or adjacent to any saleyard or in any public place (including a road);
- Infected sheep must be treated;
- Inspectors of livestock have the power to test and restrict movement of infected or suspect sheep and to ensure treatment is carried out.

"Strains of the bacteria
"_Dichelobacter nodosus_ (_D. nodosus_) bacteria are divided into a number of sub-groups, strains, or serotypes identified by a letter of the alphabet. An outbreak of footrot may involve one or several serotypes.

"It attacks by digesting the connective tissue between the horn and flesh of the hoof, and also under the horn of the foot.

"The virulence varies widely between the various strains of bacteria. Most bacteria fall somewhere between the benign and virulent extremes.

"For practical purposes the range is divided in 2 and each case referred to as either benign or virulent.

"When assessing virulence by examining feet it is important to consider the environment of the sheep's foot and the time since infection occurred.

"Benign footrot
Benign footrot is bacteria of low virulence that have poor ability to under-run the hoof horn and mostly affect the skin between the toes.

"Benign footrot can be controlled during the active stages by foot bathing. This may be repeated as often as required.

"Moving sheep on to drier country is often sufficient to help recovery. However, the disease is likely to recur in the next favourable season.

"If regular footbathing is required to control the disease, then it is possible that virulent footrot is present and a different approach needs to be taken to treatments, control, and eradication.

"Virulent footrot
"Virulent footrot bacteria rapidly under-run and separate the hoof horn from the foot.

"Ideal environment for the bacteria
"_D. nodosus_ requires warm, moist conditions for ideal multiplication. The bacteria can only survive away from the foot for a maximum of 7 days, even in ideal conditions. In less favourable dry conditions, the bacteria die rapidly.

"How the bacteria is spread
"Spread is primarily from foot to foot via pasture or mud, so moist pastures, laneways, and muddy yards are the main areas where footrot is spread.

"Footrot will therefore spread most rapidly when it is warm and moist, as in spring and some autumns.

"What kills _D. nodosus_?
"Footrot bacteria are readily killed by dry heat, sunlight, cold, dry environment, and a number of different chemicals. Most domestic disinfectants will destroy _D. nodosus_ but are not registered or recommended for treating sheep as they are easily de-activated by dirt contamination.

"Zinc sulphate, 'Radicate' and formalin (formalin, formol) are the chemicals currently registered for the treatment of footrot in footbaths. [Read instructions carefully to see if the product is to be used 'as is' or needs dilution. - Mod.TG]

"Immunity to footrot
"Sheep that have been infected with or exposed to footrot do not develop any significant natural immunity or resistance. Short-term immunity can be achieved using vaccines.

"Breed of sheep susceptible to footrot
"All breeds of sheep and goats can contract footrot, although British breeds are less susceptible.
- Foot shape and structure affect susceptibility.
- Goats are usually less severely affected and may exhibit different symptoms to sheep infected with the same strain of bacteria.
- Merinos are often the most susceptible and severely affected.
- Low-virulence strains are most severe in Merinos but are also seen in British breeds, goats and cattle.
- There are a few strains of sheep that are resistant to footrot, but at present they are of no commercial significance." - Mod.TG
