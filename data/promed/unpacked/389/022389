According to the Russian epidemiological surveillance center, 2 residents
of the Budenovskiy and Krasnogardeyskiy districts of Stavropol have been
diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). They were infected
while removing ticks from domestic animals. A preliminary diagnosis of CCHF
has also been made in 16 other people from 11 districts, who were treated
in hospital. Of these, 5 are children under the age of 14.
This year [2007], 818 people have requested treatment for tick bites, 368
of them children. In the past week alone nearly 300 people have applied for
treatment. These data are evidence of an abundance of ticks in the
environment. The Stavropol health care authorities are actively engaged in
epidemic control measures and in promotion of awareness of the danger among
the general population.

[Currently we are witnessing an increase in the number of cases of CCHF in
Stavropol. In 2004, 28 cases registered; in 2005, there were 38, and in
2006, 41 cases. Cases of CCHF have already been recorded in Astrakhan and
Rostov, which are parts of the southern federal district of Russia, as well
as in the southern part of the neighbouring Republic of Kazakhstan.
Inadequate measures for control of rodents, in conjunction with an
unseasonable warm winter, are resulting in an increase in the density of
ticks and a corresponding increase in the incidence of CCHF in southern
Russia and Kazakhstan. - Mod.NP
