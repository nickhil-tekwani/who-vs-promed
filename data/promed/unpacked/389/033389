WHO Confirms at Least One Ebola Fever Case in Gabon
---------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Sat 8 Dec 2001 that there had
been at least one case of infection by Ebola virus in Gabon, following
reports that 10 people had died of a mystery illness in the Central African
country.
A WHO official said in the Gabon capital Libreville on Friday that 10
people, including a nurse, had died in Gabon from a disease it was feared
could be Ebola fever. WHO told Reuters from its Geneva headquarters on Sat
8 Dec 2001 that at least one case of Ebola fever had been reported from
Gabon. At least 66 people died from Ebola in the same area of Gabon in 1996.
Another WHO official said on Fri 7 Dec 2001 that 28 people had died of
haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo and doctors feared
that outbreak might also be Ebola fever.
There is no known cure and no vaccine for Ebola, which causes up to 90
percent of victims to bleed to death in a matter of days. The disease was
discovered in 1976 near the Ebola river in what is now the Democratic
Republic of Congo [formerly Zaire.
WHO said in a weekly bulletin in Geneva on Fri 7 dec 2001 that it had
received reports of cases of suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in Ogooue
Iveindo province in the northeastern part of Gabon and had sent a team to
investigate. An official in Libreville said on Fri 7 Dec 2001 that blood
samples had been taken from victims in Gabon and sent to South Africa for
tests.

[This news-wire report may be premature. As yet there appears to be no
confirmation by laboratory testing that Ebola virus has been isolated from
any patient either in Gabon or in the Democratic Republic of Congo. - Mod.CP
