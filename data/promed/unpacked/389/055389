Early warning test kits for foot and mouth disease (FMD) are to be
developed by Marks & Spencer in partnership with Tridelta, a research
company based near Dublin, Ireland, a company that specializes in health
tests for humans and animals. The devices, which will indicate problems by
a simple change of color, have been compared to pregnancy-testing kits.
They will be used on farms and in abattoirs to detect a range of other
diseases by testing animals' saliva for abnormal levels of proteins.
The announcement came as farmers voiced concern about moves to re-open
large areas of the Lake District, claiming they could lead to a second wave
of the epidemic. If development work goes to plan, simple versions of the
kits could be available within a year.
The kits could overcome the problem of discovering FMD in sheep -- the
species in which the virus is hardest to detect clinically. It is believed
[that the virus which has devastated the livestock industry incubated
undetected in Britain's sheep population for weeks.

[As worded, this newspaper report is confusing as it starts by saying one
thing (development of a rapid FMD test) and ends by describing another
capability altogether (identifying animals under stress). In the absence of
further clarification we must await the reality. Plus, a test is useless
unless we know its sensitivity and specificity. These parameters are known
only following rigorous testing. - Mod.MHJ
