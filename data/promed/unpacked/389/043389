[1] Central African Republic (Kabo, Ouham prefecture): Ebola suspected, RFI

Discovery of suspected Ebola cases in the Central African Republic
----------------------------------------
[Unconfirmed preliminary report from unofficial sources]

Four people have died of haemorrhagic fever in the Central African Republic, raising suspicions of an early Ebola outbreak in that country.

The victims are located in the city of Kabo in the prefecture of Ouham-Fafa, and local doctors put forward the hypothesis of the Ebola virus. But the Minister of Health, Pierre Somse, prefers to wait for the results of the analysis of the samples before officially deciding on the nature of the disease.

Pending these results, Minister Somse calls on the Central African population to be "calm" and practice "vigilance", while reassuring them that measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease. The last Ebola alert in the Central African Republic dates back to last August [2020] when a case was reported in Côte d'Ivoire, a country in which population movements are quite frequent. Bangui [capital of CAR] then initiated an operation to detect and manage any suspected cases early.

A sitrep report was posted: Central African Republic: EVD Preparedness - Emergency Action Plan Final Report (MDRCF026) 09 Jul 2021
https://reliefweb.int/report/central-african-republic/central-african-republic-evd-preparedness-emergency-action-plan

"A. Situation Analysis
"Description of Disaster
"This DREF [Disaster Relief Emergency Fund] operation was launched on 30 Jun 2020, to support Central African Red Cross (CARC) to implement preparedness actions to prevent an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in country, as well as prepare the National Society to respond in the unfortunate event that an outbreak was declared.

"Indeed, on 30 May 2020, the Provincial Director of Health of Equateur Province informed of four suspected EVD deaths in the Air Congo district of the Mbandaka health zone in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

"This suspicion was confirmed on 1 Jun 2020, and the Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) declared the 11th outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in the Equateur province. Due to their geographical proximity, CAR and DRC share significant trade and social links over approximately 1300 km on either side of the Oubangui River. These exchanges, take place through river navigation, United Nations Humanitarian Air Services (UNHAS) between Bangui, capital of the CAR to Mbandaka and Kinshaha in DRC, and are part of the secular and ancestral links between these countries.

"Though the operation was initially launched for a 3 months timeframe, an Operation Update was published on 21 Sep 2020, extending the operation by 3 additional months. This was because of delays registered in implementation due to COVID-19 lockdowns imposed by the Government as a containment measure for the pandemic.

"Summary of Response
"Overview of the Operating National Society Response
"At national level, 18 entry points remained operational along the Ubangui River, that is 10 in Bangui and 8 in the Moungoumba area, within Mbaïki health district. The 8 surveillance sites at these entry points were built by CRCA/IFRC while the 10 at Bangui were merely reinforced with surveillance equipment (non-contact frontal thermometers, handwashing devices, passenger check-in registers).

"Soon after the outbreak was declared in the DRC, the national headquarters of the Central African Red Cross alerted local committees in the health districts close to the border with affected areas to ensure that they were aware and could reactivate volunteers who were trained in 2018. This response was initially slow due to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which required physical distancing to be observed everywhere and restricted movement of people."

[2] Congo DR (North Kivu province): US Level 3 travel advisory

New Ebola Outbreak Centered in Central Africa
----------------------------------------
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a new Level 3 Travel Advisory for the Butsili Health Area, Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

The CDC says 'travelers should avoid all nonessential travel to Beni Health Zone.'

Travelers to this area should seek medical care immediately if they develop fever, muscle pain, sore throat, diarrhea, weakness, vomiting, stomach pain, or unexplained bleeding or bruising during or after travel, up to 21 days.

On [8 Oct 2021], the DRC's Ministry of Health declared an Ebola outbreak.

Since then, the World Health Organization has worked with local health authorities to identify transmission sources, conduct case investigations, strengthen local laboratory capacity, and provide Ebola vaccines.

Ebola Zaire vaccines are U.S. FDA and European Medicines Agency approved to protect people from contracting the Ebola virus disease.

The Ebola virus was first described in 1976 near the Ebola River in the DRC. Since then, the virus has emerged periodically and infected people in several African countries.

Previously, the CDC issued Travel Alerts for various disease outbreaks in the DRC, such as COVID-19 and monkeypox.

[3] New Ebola vaccine
Date: Thu 11 Nov 2021

The University of Oxford are beginning the 1st human trials of an Ebola vaccine on 26 volunteers, using the same technology as the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. ChAdOxl biEBOV is being tested for safety and immunogenicity and may protect against multiple species of the virus.

Though effective vaccines against Ebola have been developed in recent years, experts warn that these have been approved for only one out of the 4 species of the Ebola virus. "There are 3 other important species of Ebola virus out there that these vaccines aren't approved to prevent," said Dr Daniel Jenkin, principal investigator of the trial at the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. "This disease can be caused by several different species of virus and each of them may require an immune response."

The Ebola vaccines currently available are approved against the Zaire species of Ebola, responsible for many outbreaks of the virus and the species with the highest mortality rate.

Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever with symptoms beginning between 2 days and 3 weeks after infection. The first symptoms usually include fever, sore throat, muscle pain, and headaches, followed by vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and decreased liver and kidney function, where some begin to bleed internally and externally. The disease kills an average of 50% of those infected.

The Oxford vaccine is based on the ChAdOxl virus, which is a weakened version of a common cold virus, genetically modified so that it cannot replicate in humans. ChAdOx technology has been in development for several years. As a result of the success of the AstraZeneca vaccine, scientists are hopeful that the vaccine technology will be effective against other conditions including malaria, HIV, cancers including prostate cancers, and shingles.

[ChAdOx1 is an adenoviral vector for vaccines that was developed by the Jenner Institute, University of Oxford. The vector is a chimpanzee adenovirus modified to avoid its replication.

Adenoviruses are effective vectors for inducing and boosting cellular immunity to encoded recombinant antigens. However, the widespread seroprevalence of neutralizing antibodies to common human adenovirus serotypes limits their use. Simian adenoviruses do not suffer from the same disadvantages. Therefore, investigators have tested new vaccines using the chimp adenovirus ChAdOx1 as a vector (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChAdOx1). - Mod.LK]
