I am a medical doctor working as a physician in Uganda.

There is an outbreak of anthrax in a human settlement in one of the
Western districts of the country at a location called Sheema
[district]. It is thought to have spread from cattle to humans through
ingestion of contaminated beef.

It is not clear how many people are affected, but there is a ban on
consuming beef and milk products and especially today 6 Nov 2011,
which was IDD [Eid] day for the Muslims, whose theme was the slaughter
of animals.

The Ministry of Agriculture is doing everything to control the
situation.

District health officials have disclosed that 2 people have died in
Sheema district following an outbreak of anthrax. The district health
officer, Dr Johnson Kabwishwa, said the disease reportedly broke out
in Mashojwa village in Muzira sub-county on 25 Oct 2011.

Kabwishwa identified the deceased as a 55-year-old butcher and another

the 2 men died last week [week of 31 Oct 2011] after they showed signs
similar to those of anthrax.

Suspected anthrax outbreak spreads to Mbarara Share
The recent outbreak of Anthrax which killed two people and three
animals in Sheema district is suspected to have spread to the
neighbouring sub-county of Bubaare in Mbarara district. FB, 55 and his
colleague only identified as B died last week after they reportedly
skinned a carcass of a cow. While five people were admitted in Kabwohe
health centre IV since the disease reportedly broke out in Mashojwa
village, Muzira Parish in Kagango Sub-county on October 25. The
outbreak of the disease affected the Muslim community in the district
as they celebrated Idd Adhuha without meat because veterinary
officials restricted the movement of livestock and slaughtering of
animals in the district. Dr. Christopher Kyambadde, the district
veterinary officer, said more four cows died in a suspected anthrax
outbreak in Kabwohe-Intendero town council, Kagango Sub County in
Sheema district on Sunday and Monday morning bringing the number of
the dead animals to seven. He added that a further outbreak was
reported in a neighbouring sub-county of Bubaare in Mbarara district
after one cow died and buried. Dr.Wilson Kafeero Mbonye, the
veterinary officer in the neighbouring district of Buhweju, who
witnessed the burial of the cow suspected to have died of anthrax in
Kamushoko village, Bubaare Sub-county in Mbarara, said he informed the
Mbarara district veterinary officers to take precautions. "The cow
died in Kyantambara farm belonging to HM. I instructed people to bury
it immediately because I never wanted them die after feasting on the
carcass of the cow suspected to have contracted the disease," He
added. Dr. John Lewis Barigye, the Mbarara district veterinary
officer, said it was not confirmed whether the cow died of the anthrax
but advised the public to keep away from the dead animals to avoid
contracting the disease. "We haven't established the cause of the
death but we have imposed a restriction on the movement of livestock
and their bio products in Bubaare Sub-county as precautionary measures
to stop the spread of the disease," Barigye said. He appealed all the
stakeholders to be vigilant and stop the slaughtering of animals and
smuggling of meat in the Sub-County. (Fred Turyakira)

[It seems that each Eid somewhere in the world is conflicted by a
local anthrax outbreak. Last year (2010) it was the aftereffects of
the national epidemic in Bangladesh. This year (2011), the Sheema
district in the Western region of Uganda.
It appears that the cause of the deaths, whether bovine or human,
awaits confirmation, even though the pattern to date would not be
untypical of anthrax. I have heard from Robert Downing, CDC, that:
"There is anthrax in Sheema. CDC has sent swabs and the rapid Ag test
for animals. We hope human [samples] are on their way back to Ebb
now."

The festival of Eid-al-Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice,
commemorates Ibrahim's (Abraham) willingness to sacrifice his son to
God. This year it is from 6-9 Nov. This festival also marks the end of
the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Eid al-Adha celebrations start after the
Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia by Muslims
worldwide. The date is approximately 70 days (2 Months and 10 days)
after the end of the month of Ramadan, that is, Eid-ul-Fitr. Ritual
observance of the holiday lasts until sunset of the 13th day of Dhu
al-Hijjah.

Livestock anthrax is only sporadically reported in Uganda -- latterly
outbreaks in wildlife, especially hippopotami in the Queen Elizabeth
Park, have been getting attention. However though there were no
official human cases in 2009, ProMED-mail reported some 9 cases with 6
deaths in Bushenyi district, that were ascribed, as far as anyone
could tell from the reports, from exposure to game meat and where some
51 hippo were recorded as dying from anthrax. Prior to 1 Jul 2010,
Sheema district was a county of Bushenyi district.

We would appreciate confirmation of this report by our members in
Uganda.
