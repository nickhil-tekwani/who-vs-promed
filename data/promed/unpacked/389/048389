["Some of the risk factors for avian influenza in Nepal are the following:
- Formal and informal trade of domestic poultry, eggs, meat and wild/pet birds
- Wintering of migratory birds
- Sharing common habitat among migratory and residential wild birds
- Unorganized markets of poultry and pet birds
- Poor attention on biosecurity measures
- Unorganized and densely poultry populated areas
- Open porous border to India & China"

The above information as well a more detailed description about the passive and active surveillance national program on HPAI that Nepal has developed can be found in the presentation titled "Panel session on Surveillance of Avian Influenza in Nepal." This presentation was made within the framework of the OIE Regional Expert Group Meeting for the Control of Avian Influenza in Asia, Sapporo, Japan, 3-5 Oct 2017 and is available at https://tinyurl.com/y3grajy5. - Mod.CRD
