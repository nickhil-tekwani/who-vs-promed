The Government has confirmed an outbreak of koi herpesvirus (KHV) disease in fish at a few sites in the UK.

KHV is a serious viral disease that affects common and ornamental carp species (_Cyprinus carpio_) and can result in large-scale mortalities. It is a listed disease in the UK and currently, disease controls are in place at a site in Cheshire to bring things under control.

Fish affected can show the following signs, according to https://www.gov.uk/government/news/outbreaks-of-koi-herpesvirus-khv-disease-in-2022, especially when water temperatures are between 16 and 28 deg C [60.8-82.4 deg F]:

- necrotic (white or brown) patches on the gills
- rough patches on the skin and sloughing mucous
- sunken eyes

Sites with KHV disease are required to go through a thorough monitoring procedure, and if owners anticipate an outbreak, they must call the Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) [https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/fish-health-inspectorate#contact]. This includes fish exhibiting the aforementioned symptoms or carp or carp hybrid fatalities.

According to the government, there is no risk to the public's health. However, once an epidemic is confirmed, facilities are required to participate in a formal monitoring programme, which involves FHI visits to find disease evidence and validate that measures are in place.

The Government said sites with a confirmed outbreak must observe the following conditions:
- No person may, without the previous consent in writing of the FHI, move any aquatic animal including eggs, and gametes, into, out of or within a confirmed designation area.
- Disposal of dead aquatic animals, including eggs and gametes, must be by an approved method for disposal of Category 2 animal-by-product waste in compliance with local Environmental Health department requirements.
- Notify the Fish Health Inspectorate immediately should mortalities re-occur or spread to other waters within the designated area.
- Notify the FHI in advance of all intended physical changes to sites within the designated area -- such as site boundaries, number or size of waters, use of the site. FHI written permission will be required beforehand for all such changes.
- All requests for consent required under this Confirmed Designation Notice must be submitted to the FHI with a minimum of 5 working days' notice.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted through fish-to-fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets, and other equipment. As other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. - Mod.PMB
