Dengue is controlled, but we have to ["bust"] the mosquito [that
transmits dengue virus]. This was the statement put forward by the
Santa Fe Minister of Health, Miguel Angel Cappiello this Thursday [23
Apr 2009] after stating that the number of people ill [with dengue]
remains at about 650 in the entire area [of the state].

Within this framework, one emphasizing that prevention and the public
awareness campaign continue, he summarized the objective of this year
[2009] with a curious sentence: "The expression may sound vulgar, but
we must break the [mosquito's] balls in winter to prevent dengue in
summer," he stated.

The same message [that dengue cases have reached a plateau] was
conveyed independently by Mayor Miguel Lifschitz -- despite new
dengue cases ... -- when he stated, "the peak of the infection has
passed."

A dengue outbreak has been reported in some parts of
Thiruvananthapuram district. What's even more worrying is that the
Thiruvananthapuram Medical College campus may itself may be the
epicentre from where the disease has spread.

Health workers are trying to stop the spread of dengue in the campus.
There are reports that some doctors and paramedical staff in the
hospital have been affected. The outbreak was first reported a week
ago but with elections happening, this apparently did not get
attention. "Doctors and the paramedical staff are under threat of the
disease that's why we are cleaning the campus," said Dr Sreekumar,
Resident Medical Officer. The Thiruvananthapuram medical college has
now been closed down because of dengue outbreak, 12 cases were
reported from this hospital and the doctors have now been shifted to
a new accommodation. Patients with suspected dengue are to be shifted
out from general wards to this exclusive ward for fever cases. With
summer showers already on and monsoon approaching medical teams are
carrying out vector control measures and cleanliness drive on the
campus.

"Awareness of the people is very [low] even in Kerala that is a
surprise. So, people are dumping all waste in plastic bags in this
area," said P K Sreemathy, Health Minister, Kerala.

[8] Saudi Arabia (Makkah): NOT

Health Minister Dr Abdullah Al-Rabeeah dismissed, in a statement
yesterday [25 Apr 2009], reports of deaths caused by dengue fever in
the Makkah province as contrary to facts. "No death attributed to
dengue fever has been reported in the region till date. After the
passing of 17 weeks since the breakout of the disease only 44 cases
of the fever have been reported," Al-Rabeeah told Arab News after a
meeting with Makkah Mayor Osama Al-Bar at his office yesterday [25
Apr 2009].

"The combating of dengue fever is a top priority for not only the
mayoralty, but the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of
Agriculture," Al-Rabeeah said while assuring the public that the
disease was under control. The mayor's office and other governmental
departments are also to implement a scheme to beef up the combating
of the disease, he added.

"The Ministry of Health does not deny the presence of the fever in
the province but it is at a very low rate compared to other parts of
the world. Serious efforts are under way to contain its spread in the
region. We hope that media campaigns would educate people on
precautions to be taken to keep them safe," the minister said. The
minister stressed the significance of developing a civic culture on
water consumption so that water is not allowed to pool in open areas
thus providing a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The minister also
referred to the current campaign of insecticide spraying in
residential areas.

"It is comforting to learn that integrated action teams have been set
up in different areas of the city to fight the disease-carrying
insects," he added. Saleh Ezzat, director of cleaning in the Makkah
municipality, said aerial spraying to kill dengue mosquitoes would be
undertaken in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture.
"Necessary supplies of insecticides have been procured for aerial
spraying over regions to the north and south of Makkah," the official
said. He added that the municipal teams sprayed insecticide at more
than 160 schools in the area. He said no spraying was undertaken in
schools during class hours to avoid exposing pupils to insecticides.

[Aerial spraying will, at best, provide very temporary reduction of
_Aedes_ vector mosquito populations. Efforts to reduce breeding sites
will be more effective.
