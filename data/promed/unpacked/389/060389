I noted the record of scavengers not eating carcasses in recent
correspondence from [ProMED-mail, Hemorrhagic disease - Kenya (15) [cited
above. This is perhaps not surprising if there is high mortality. The
scavengers can only eat so much and then digestion can take days. They
still approach carcasses and often just sit and watch unable to feed
anymore but still keen. I observed this with the recent rinderpest epidemic
in National Parks in Kenya 1993-96.
There has been mortality affecting wild ruminants in Kenya over the last
few weeks and results from samples are pending. The syndrome looks more
like Bluetongue or EHD.
The conditions are conducive for a number of insect-borne diseases so what
is being seen is perhaps not surprising.
We must be careful to not read too much into observations on wild animals!

[Presumably the territorial claims of resident scavenger groups are still
holding and they have yet to see a major influx of outside groups. It will
be interesting to see what effect this excess food availability will have
on hatching, litter sizes, and weaning success during the next twelve
months. - Mod.MHJ
