Potato cultivation being hampered due to leaf blight disease
------------------------------------------------------------
Potato cultivators of the district of Jessore [Khulna division] have
become frustrated due to widespread outbreak of leaf blight disease
in potato fields. Department of Agricultural Extension [DAE] sources
said some 1000 hectares [2470 acres] of potato fields have been
affected with the disease.

Dense fog at night and hot weather in the day caused the outbreak of
the disease in the potato fields, a DAE official said. They have
suggested farmers use anti-fungal medicines in the potato fields.

Farmers said they have brought less land under potato cultivation
this season [2009] due to high price of pesticide, seeds, and
fertilizer. Besides, they said they have lost interest in potato
cultivation as they incurred loss last year [2008].

[There are 2 major leaf blights of potato, and both are due to
fungus-like organisms. Early blight (_Alternaria solani_) causes
symptoms of spotting and early senescence of leaflets, as well as
lesions on tubers. Infected plants remain symptomless until they
approach maturity, and yield is reduced. Late blight (_Phytophthora
infestans_) affects both leaves and tubers and may cause yield losses
of up to 75 percent. This pathogen also affects tomato, and
solanaceous weeds can serve as pathogen reservoirs.

Early blight occurs over a wider range of climatic conditions than
late blight. The fungi are spread with infected plant material
(including tubers), by mechanical means, wind, and rain. Management
strategies for both diseases include fungicide treatments of seed
tubers and crops, as well as use of cultivars with reduced
susceptibility. For more information see ProMED-mail post no.
20080107.0091 for early blight, and previous posts and links listed
below for late blight.

It is not specified above which leaf blight has been diagnosed. Both
diseases were reported from Bangladesh last year (2008, ProMED-mail
post no. 20080107.0091) and are likely to have contributed to the
2008 crop losses mentioned in the story. While several outbreaks of
late blight have been reported recently in the region, it is possible
that either pathogen or a combination of both is the cause of this
outbreak in Bangladesh.
