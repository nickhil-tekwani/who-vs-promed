Bluetongue in a sentinel animal in Germany (4 Apr 2007)
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Disease report
On 30 Mar 2007, the German veterinary authorities reported that BTV
(bluetongue virus) was detected in a sentinel bovine animal in
Landkreis Osnabruck (Lower Saxony). [Interactive map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=52.2673&lon=8.0532&scale=4000000&icon=x>
- Mod. AS]. On this basis, Germany suspended the vector-free period
(European Commission, 2007). The infected premises with sentinel
cattle appear to be within the previously established restricted
area. Following the findings in Germany and results of their trapping
programme, the Netherlands and Belgium also announced the end of
vector-free period (European Commission, 2007a). This is an evolving
situation.
2. Situation assessment
Just over 2100 outbreaks (clinical cases) of BTV-8 have been reported
in the affected EU Member States since mid 2006. While the number of
reported cases had significantly declined at the end of 2006, there
have been a few new serological and virus positive cases reported
from the beginning to mid-January 2007 onwards (see cumulative map of
reported outbreaks since mid 2006) [accessible at the above URL. -
Mod.AS]
Although the epidemiological evidence in the affected EU Member
States is still being analysed, this most recent finding in Germany
may suggest that the virus has managed to 'overwinter'. However, it
still remains uncertain how widespread the virus may be in the
affected areas either in susceptible animals or biological vectors.
The likelihood that a susceptible animal will become infected with
BTV depends on many factors: the competence of the vector, the rate
of infection of the competent vectors and their biting rates, and the
susceptibility of the host. There would be a few other factors that
may contribute to the maintenance and spread of the virus. Apart from
viraemia, one is the use of unhygienic veterinary interventions (such
as, surgery, hypodermic needles) in domestic livestock and another is
the presence and the maintenance of the virus in wild susceptible
animals. It still remains uncertain whether any investigations on
susceptible wild and zoo animals in the affected areas have been
carried out.
The role of ectoparasites in the mechanical transmission of BTV is
unclear. The virus has also been detected in some ectoparasites of
ruminant wildlife that may be common to domestic ruminants. However,
it is unknown to what extent their role may be important in the
epidemiology of BTV-8 in the affected EU Member States. While they
may potentially play a role in limited local mechanical transmission,
their role as potential biological vector is unknown.
The likelihood that a vector will become infected by feeding on an
infected animal and be able to transmit the virus will depend upon
the quantity of the virus in the blood of the host animal, the
conditions for virus propagation in the vector (that is,
temperature), the competence of the vector population and the
survival rate of the vectors.
Within the next few weeks, populations of competent biological
vectors are expected to rise. In this case, further sporadic cases of
BTV-8 may be expected to occur in mid spring, probably leading to
more cases by the end of spring and beginning of summer. The expected
peak tends to occur in late summer and in autumn.
Under EU rules, legal trade in susceptible livestock can take place
from the areas of the currently affected EU Member States that are
allowed to trade.
3. Conclusions
The BTV-8 developments in the EU are of significant epidemiological
importance. They have highlighted that environmental conditions in
northwest Europe may exist to favour establishment of any BTV type
infection. On the basis of emerging epidemiological evidence and
dynamic situation in the affected EU Member States:
a) There is a low but increased likelihood that BTV-8 virus may be
present in the currently affected areas in the EU at the beginning of
spring. This is likely to coincide with the time when the population
of competent biological vectors is expected to rise. Should this be
the case, sporadic cases of BTV-8 may be expected to occur in mid
spring, probably leading to more cases by the end of spring and
beginning of summer. A peak in outbreaks of BTV tends to occur in
late summer but with a pool of infected animals that may be present
in spring and early summer, the dynamics of an outbreak of bluetongue
could be difficult to predict.
b) The current developments still present a low but increased
likelihood of the introduction of BTV-8 virus to the UK from the
currently affected areas.
The likelihood of the introduction of the virus by legal trade in
susceptible livestock from areas of the currently affected EU Member
States that are allowed to trade would be low. This highlights
importance of the continuing post-import testing.
The likelihood of windborne transmission of infected biological
insect vectors would increase if new cases continue to be detected in
susceptible animals, particularly on the western coast of some of the
affected EU Member States. This highlights the importance of
maintaining enhanced vigilance for even mild clinical signs
indicative of bluetongue in areas identified as at risk on the basis
of meteorological monitoring and monitoring of vectors in these areas.

End of bluetongue-free and midge-free period
--------------------------------------------
Ms Verburg, Minister of Agriculture, Nature, and Food Quality has
today [30 Mar 2007] decided to tighten up the regulation on
bluetongue protection zones (Regeling beperkingsgebieden bluetongue
2006). The Minister has made this decision because in the past week
more than 10 midges of the _Culicoides_ species have been caught in
different places in the Netherlands, France, and Luxembourg. Also, in
Germany, a positive sentinel animal was found in Landkreis Osnabruck,
approximately 100 km (62 miles) from the Dutch border. Sentinel
animals are animals that were found to be free of bluetongue up to
the start of the midge-free period. The discovery of a positive
sentinel animal in Germany means that the bluetongue virus is back
again.
This new infection in a cow in Germany brings to an end the
agreements between the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, and
Luxembourg, which relaxed transport movements between these
countries. The regular bluetongue regime is again in force.
A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test is compulsory for the
transport of cows, sheep, and goats from the 20 km (12.5 miles)-zone
to a business in the protection zones in the Netherlands, Belgium,
France, Germany, and Luxembourg. This also applies to the transport
of young animals. A ban has been introduced on transport from the 20
km-zone to the unrestricted areas of Belgium, France, Germany, and
Luxembourg. Vehicles used for transporting ruminants must be treated
with insecticide before the journey begins. The use of insecticide
for vehicles in transit through the protection zone or the 20 km-zone
is again in force.
The transport of ruminants from the 20 km-zone to a slaughterhouse in
the protection zones in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany,
and Luxembourg is not subject to restriction. Such transport is no
longer permitted to unrestricted areas in Belgium, France, Germany,
and Luxembourg.
Transport of ruminants from the protection zone in the Netherlands to
a business or slaughterhouse in the protection zones in Belgium,
France, Germany, and Luxembourg is permitted.
For the transport of ruminants from the protection zone to other
Member States or third countries, permission is required from the
receiving country.
The transport of young billy goats from the Netherlands is no longer permitted.

[It may be assumed that similar measures are currently applied in the
other affected territories in Germany, Belgium, France, and
Luxembourg.
Seroconversion in susceptible ruminants might lead to a conclusion
that the vector remained active throughout the winter, since no
transovarial transmission of the bluetongue virus is known to
prevail. It remains to be seen if this worrying finding remains
solitary; entomological research and surveillance deserve to be
prioritised. By the fall of 2007, young ruminants, born since the end
of 2006 to positive dams in the affected countries, will have lost
their maternal antibodies and become susceptible to potential new
infection.
One should also pay attention to the possible involvement of wild
ruminants, as rightly remarked in the above DEFRA assessment
document. The deer population in Europe has increased considerably
during the previous century. For instance, the estimated size of
Germany's cervid population (older than 18 months), for the years
2002-2005, was 3 492 000 roe deer, 181 000 red deer, and 157 000
fallow deer (see reference below). - Mod.AS]
