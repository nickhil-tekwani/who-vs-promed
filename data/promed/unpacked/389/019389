The Oakland County Health Division says 63 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed over the past year, that's 58 more than the previous year [2016]. This includes 8 more cases of hepatitis A that have been confirmed in the Farmington Hills area over the past week.

The health division has not identified a source but are urging residents to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of contracting the disease.

"We contribute this increase in confirmed cases to illicit drug use in the community," said Pamela Hackert, medical director for the county's health division. "When 8 cases are in more of a localized community that is a high number."

Although a source has not been found, the health division is investigating potential common factors such as contaminated food, sick individuals, travel, and healthcare exposure.

Since [26 Jun 2017], there have been 13 confirmed cases in the county. From [1 Aug 2015 through 31 Jul 2016] there were only 5 confirmed cases in the county.

There have been 247 confirmed cases statewide in 2017 compared to 132 in 2016.

Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for the county's health division, said it's important to practice proper hygiene to reduce the risk.

"The health division urges all residents, food handlers, and healthcare providers to get the Hepatitis A vaccine and to wash hands thoroughly," said Leigh-Anne Stafford, health officer for the county's health division. "Food workers and health care workers are encouraged to stay home from work, seek medical attention, and report their illness to their employer."

Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by a virus and is vaccine-preventable.

Dr Pamela Hackert, medical director for county's health division, said the virus is shed in feces and is most commonly spread from person to person by contaminated hands.

Symptoms may appear from 2 to 6 weeks after exposure, with the average time being about one month.

[Previous postings reported an increased number of cases of hepatitis A from the eastern side of Michigan's lower peninsula in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties, and the city of Detroit. The outbreak appears to have been going on for some time and ProMED would appreciate additional information regarding risk factors of the cohort including MSM, travel, homelessness and illicit drug use.

One previous post (Hepatitis A - USA (12): (MI) fatal, RFI archive no. 20170707.5158430) from 7 Jul 2017 reported a case fatality rate of 4.5 percent, higher than the parallel larger outbreak in San Diego, California which does not appear based on genetic studies to be related to the Michigan cluster. Whether there have been additional fatalities is not clearly reported. - Mod.LL
