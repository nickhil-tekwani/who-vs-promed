Subject: Risks to Field Biologists
1. I read with interest the latest postings RE: Rabies, human, risks from
bat urine (02) c/o Ken Olds at CHPPM. I agree with your summation at the
end. More needs to be learned!
2. I "beg the question" from a different perspective, less esoteric than
"cryptic" or "aerosolized" exposures to rabies virus. I'm concerned with
what can often be characterized as "routine bite incidents" among bat
researchers (usually in field sampling situations).
a. The core of my queries involve what is precisely known about the degree
of protection actually afforded by pre-exposure vaccinations to people who
routinely handle/contact bats.
b. I reiterate here that many bat handlers either by choice or through
necessity of dexterity use bare hands and are often bitten (even gnawed
upon). It is my understanding that they rarely, if ever, seek
post-exposure treatment -- relying instead on the "security" of prior
inoculations to prevent the disease.
c. Compare this "modus operandi" among bat handlers in the context of the
CDC recommendations paraphrased by Dr. Kazmierczak: "Post-exposure
prophylaxis should be considered...when... contact with a bat... occurs...
or contact with bat's teeth or claws." ... etc."
d. The difference in attitude (among bat handlers) and perhaps in protocol
for bat handlers, must be due to the pre-exposure vaccinations. Is there a
different CDC protocol to be followed by persons already inoculated? If
so, what are the criteria for seeking and receiving post-exposure treatment
(it is my understanding that the number of injections is merely reduced).
If not, then why haven't there been any fatalities among "laissez-faire"
bat biologists (especially those who may have been overdue for their
periodic booster)?
3. In summary, I want to know if pre-exposure vaccinations and timely
boosters are 95-99% protective and efficacious (based upon any actual
statistics) or if biologists/handlers are operating with a false sense of
security?
a. I have handled a few local insectivorous bats during a recent survey.
Their bites are not really painful, merely annoying like the pinpricks of a
phlebotomist. If I should follow the CDC recommendations diligently, how
many times can I receive post-exposure injections and at what intervals or
frequency over a season or a year? Is actual "immunity" ever achieved
within vaccinated individuals over time?
b. These sort of questions seem more pressing and pragmatic for a group of
humans who are "exposed actually and frequently via all known or cryptic
pathways." Are pre-exposure vaccinations the panacea which renders all my
questions/concerns moot? If so, Connaught Labs or other manufacturers are
missing a golden (marketing) opportunity -- scare em, then reassure em.
Backyard bat box builders, spelunkers, vampirophiles -- get the family
vaccinated and, [forget about it.

[Would any replies to this query please confine themselves to the necessary
precautions that should be taken by professional bat handlers, especially
if they already have been routinely vaccinated against rabies. Jonathan
raises an interesting point about the apparent absence of rabies in this
exposed group. "Luck" is not a scientifically based answer, nor one to be
dependent on. - Mod.MHJ

I have been following the rabies/bat urine story with great interest, as I
and my family were exposed on several successive days to feces (and
presumably urine, and possibly salivary aerosols) from a little brown bat
that was roosting in an umbrella above our picnic table in the Puget Sound
area of Washington state. I captured the bat (using appropriate
precautions. and without any direct contact), and then spent a frustrating
day on the phone with public health officials trying to determine whether
prophylaxis was warranted. In the end, there was no support for it, or even
for testing the bat (which I thus released), even though these bats are
known to be the principal reservoir of rabies in the area.
The point of this story is to reinforce Charlie Calisher's plea for more
study; I was stunned to discover that the virus titer of urine and feces
was unknown. Further, none of the epidemiologists I spoke to were
sufficiently knowledgable about bat behavior to help me evaluate whether
this bat was behaving in an unusual fashion.

[A few years ago we had a "bat scare" here in Baton Rouge, thanks to a very
fertile breeding season and the public suddenly noticing bats that they had
never seen before. There was no rabies, just lots of young bats. We had
many calls similar to Mark's as the Public Health folk had no knowledge of
normal bat behaviour. By the time it was over, some 20 bats had been
examined for rabies and all found negative. - Mod.MHJ
