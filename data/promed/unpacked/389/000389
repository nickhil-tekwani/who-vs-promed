Parents are advised to ensure that their children are up to date with their measles vaccination. This follows 21 reported cases of a measles outbreak in the Actonville area near Benoni between July and August [2017].

Ekurhuleni is rolling out an emergency measles vaccination campaign in all its primary care health facilities. As part of the campaign, children under the age of 5 will be vaccinated or receive a booster dose.

"Measles is a very contagious disease that can spread through contact with infected mucus or saliva and is a serious condition that can be fatal for small children. An infected person can easily release the infection into the air when they cough or sneeze," Ekurhuleni spokesperson Themba Gadebe said.

Parents should immediately rush their children to the nearest clinic for medical assistance should they show any signs of a high fever, cough, runny nose and red watery eyes.

More than 7600 children between the ages of 5 and 16 in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board area have not received 2 doses of MMR vaccine and are at risk from measles, according to Public Health Wales.

The warning comes as a measles outbreak affecting the Newport and Torfaen area continues, with 17 confirmed cases of the infection.

The outbreak can be directly linked to an ongoing outbreak of measles in Europe which has seen more than 14 000 cases and dozens of deaths since the beginning of the year [2017].

Although there are no confirmed measles cases in Cardiff and Vale University Health Board at present, Public Health Wales is warning that while the 95 percent vaccination target has not been reached, cases and outbreaks of this potentially deadly infection could be seen anywhere in Wales.

The symptoms of measles include a high temperature, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a distinctive red rash. ...

Parents whose children are not up to date with 2 doses of MMR should ensure that they contact their GP practice to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine.

Adults born since 1970, who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine, are also urged to ensure they contact their surgery about vaccination, especially if they work with children.

The 1st dose of MMR is usually given to babies at between 12 and 13 months of age, and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months of age, but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses.

About one in 5 children with measles can experience serious complications such as ear infections, pneumonia or meningitis. One in 10 children with measles ends up in hospital and in rare cases it can be fatal.

A Kurchatova et al. 2017. Preliminary Findings Indicate Nosocomial Transmission And Roma Population As Most Affected Group In Ongoing Measles B3 Genotype Outbreak In Bulgaria, March To August 2017. Eurosurveillance 22 (36). Rapid communication

Abstract. From March to August 2017, 165 measles cases were reported from 3 regions in Bulgaria. The age range was 0-55 years and 66 percent of the cases were under 9 years. The Roma population was disproportionally affected (89 percent of cases), 41 percent cases were unvaccinated and in 24 cases there was nosocomial transmission mostly in paediatric departments. A child under 12 months of age died. Control measures have been taken and the investigation is still ongoing.

Discussion. Following the occurrence of the index case in March 2017, 3 clusters of measles cases were registered in Bulgaria. Roma population living in 2 neighbouring regions in Plovdiv and Pazardjik was the most affected group.

According to the latest national census in Bulgaria in 2011 [7], the population consists of Bulgarians (84.8 percent), Turks (8.8 percent) and Roma (4.9 percent). Roma inhabit all regions of the country. They live in overcrowded communities often under poor sanitary conditions and they are characterised by frequent travel within the country and abroad [8].

Up to 2 main features of the ongoing outbreak can be outlined: (i) the existence of a vulnerable group of Roma population non-immunised or insufficiently immunised and (ii) nosocomial measles transmission in the paediatric departments of 2 hospitals in Plovdiv. The recommendation to hospitalise vulnerable Roma children, may also have contributed to the latter. ...-more

For 3 weeks, Bolivar state has [experienced a resurgence of] a disease classified as controlled. Unofficially, 3 cases of measles were confirmed in children hospitalized more than 7 days ago at the Raul Leoni Hospital in Guaiparo, the same health center that had to deal with the wave of diphtheria-affected children since September last year [2016].

At the Vista al Sol outpatient clinic in Ciudad Guayana, 2 cases with clinical diagnosis were referred to the Hospital de Guaiparo 2 weeks ago. Doctors expect results from another 15 samples that were sent to the National Institute of Hygiene because they are suspected by the symptoms presented by the patients.

In September 2016, the Pan American Health Organization announced at the 55th Directing Council that the region had eliminated endemic transmission of measles. Measles was the 5th disease eliminated from the Americas after smallpox (1971), polio (1994) and rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (2015).

In December, PAHO delivered the country's measles-free certificate to Venezuela, which was only valid for 8 months. Last [Sun 3 Sep 2017], PAHO officials were in Guaiparo hospital and were collecting samples.

The El Pais de Uruguay media outlet published on [Tue 5 Sep 2017]: "The outbreak of measles in the state of Bolivar in Venezuela, which affected children aged 5 months and 4 and 9 years, activated a protocol of the Ministry of Public Health that urges people not to stop vaccinating children before a possible contagion with people who are incubating the disease and travel to Uruguay. "

The reappearance of the virus again reveals the low immunization coverage in the country. The Network Defend Epidemiology reported that the last 2 outbreaks occurred in 2002 and 2006--2007, with autochthonous cases, which occurred after the introduction of imported cases, at times of low immunization coverage. In 2012 there were only imported cases.

"Since 2008, immunization coverage (a single dose) has been suboptimal, ranging from 78 percent - 92 percent coverage. The coverage with 2 doses (the 2nd, applied at 5 years), has been frankly insufficient, with a tendency to improve from 2009 onwards. An estimated one million children who have not received the measles vaccine in the last 8 years, "estimates the Network.

[Venezuela is in the middle of a political and economic crisis, with severe shortages of food and medicine, as well as lack of medical care. Guyana has decided to intensify measles surveillance near the border with Venezuela, even as nationals of that neighbouring country continue to seek medical treatment [in Guyana] for malaria, government announced [Thu 7 Sep 2017]. Minister of State, Joseph Harmon said the Pan American Health Organisation has advised of increased cases of measles in Bolivar State, Venezuela. As a result, he said Guyana has decided to step up measles surveillance and "adopt a high level of vaccination."

[It was reported by WHO on [Tue 13 Jun 2017] that Bhutan and the Maldives eliminated measles, becoming the 1st countries in their region to eliminate the highly infectious disease. The milestone was reached after no measles cases originating in the Maldives had been recorded since 2009 and none in Bhutan since 2012. Both countries launched immunisation programmes abound 40 years ago with mass vaccination. The WHO has set a 2020 deadline for the elimination of measles in the 11 countries it categorises as the Southeast Asia region. The region has averted an estimated 620 000 measles deaths in 2016 after carrying out vaccinations in the 11 countries, the WHO said.
Nearly 107 million children were reached with an additional dose of measles vaccine in the region between 2013 and 2016, according to the WHO.

Globally, measles remains a leading cause of death among young children in the developing world. The viral disease is spread through coughing and sneezing and can lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation or death.
