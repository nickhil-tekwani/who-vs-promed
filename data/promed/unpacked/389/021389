Trichinellosis in Latvia
------------------------
The director of Food and Veterinary Service (FVS), Vinet Veldre, has issued
a ban on smoked, salty, and pickled pork in the central market of Riga to
prevent sale of Trichinella-infected pork meat.
The ban was imposed after FVS received information from the Public Health
Agency (E1PH) that 19 people had been diagnosed with trichinellosis, stated
Ilze Mejctere, the head of the Department of Public Relations at FVS.
At least one more patient is suspected of being infected. 13 meat samples
from the central market of Riga and 2 samples from the Madonskiy district
are under investigation for Trichinella infection. Between 15 and 21 Feb
2005, APH has registered 19 cases of trichinellosis. All patients had eaten
bacon bought at the central market of Riga in January and February. The
patients live in Riga, Rizhskiy and Madonskiy districts.
During 2004 there were 2 outbreaks of trichinellosis in Latvia with a total
of 20 patients, and there were 2 outbreaks in 2003 with a total of 11 cases.

[From the report we cannot be sure that the meat sold as pork meat really
was pork meat. There have been several such outbreaks of trichinellosis.
For instance, meat from wild boar had been mixed with pork meat and pork
was sold as veal in the outbreak reported from Turkey by ProMED-mail in
2004. Another possibility is lack of veterinary control of home slaughtered
pigs as many small farms keeps pigs in their backyards and feed them with
offal and hosehold waste, which increases the risk of trichinella
infection. - Mod.EP]
