Abstract
--------
Tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, genus _Flavivirus_, causes tickborne encephalitis (TBE). In Denmark, TBE is endemic only on the island of Bornholm, with an incidence of 4 per 100 000 inhabitants per year [1,2]. Here we report 3 clinical cases of TBE in patients hospitalised within a month [June/July 2019] and all residing at the boundary of the same forest, Tisvilde Hegn [Capital Region], in Northern Zealand.

Discussion
----------
The incidence of TBE has been increasing in Denmark, in its neighbouring countries as well and in the rest of Europe in recent years, which mirrors the increased abundance of ticks, the increased geographic spread and potentially climate changes [8-11]. The vector for the European virus subtype, TBEV-Eu, is _Ixodes ricinus_, which is prevalent in most of Europe and the dominant tick species in Denmark (greater than 90%) [12]. In 2009, 2 clinical cases of TBE were reported outside Bornholm and TBEV was detected in Northern Zealand in ticks collected in the forest of Tokkekebb Hegn, which is 40 km [25 mi] south east of Tisvilde Hegn, in 2009, 2010, and 2011 [4,5]. Surprisingly, TBEV was no longer detected in the same area in Tokkekoeb Hegn during 2016 and 2017 [13]. In 2018, another 2 human cases of TBE outside Bornholm were identified on the Island of Funen and in Jutland, respectively, but no new micro foci of TBEV has been localized [14], (data not shown).

All 3 patients presented here live close to Tisvilde Hegn in Northern Zealand, and had typical biphasic disease starting with fever, gastrointestinal or influenza-like symptoms and fatigue, followed by a few days of recovery before clinical meningitis/meningoencephalitis at hospitalisation and neurologic sequelae in terms of primarily fatigue and dizziness.

Subsequent collection of _I. ricinus_ ticks from a part of Tisvilde Hegn surrounding a well-visited forest playground, where Case 3 recalled a tick bite, identified a specific area adjacent to the playground to be an acute, new, high-risk TBEV micro-focus in Northern Zealand. The estimated high prevalence of TBEV is 8% at the centre of the focus which exceeds recent prevalence estimates of 0.6% from endemic Bornholm, as well as Denmark's neighbouring countries and most European countries [4,5,8,10,11,13,15]. The presence of the virus in nymphs, but not adult ticks, and the molecular evolutionary analyses of the homogeneous TBEV sequences suggests a single TBEV introduction in 2019, probably by migrating birds from Norway. Tisvilde Hegn and the forest playground is well-visited by Danish and international tourists, and containment measures such as fencing, grass cutting and signage along the playground's eastern side have been made in order to minimise the risk of further infections and spreading.

There were previous reports of human cases TBE virus infection in Denmark in 2009 and again in 2018. The authors note that TBE virus was not found in ticks in the area in 2016 and 2018, nor were any human cases identified there then. They speculate that the virus was introduced by ticks on migratory birds.

TBE is caused by 3 different subtypes of tick borne encephalitis virus: Western European TBE virus, Far Eastern TBE virus, and Siberian TBE virus. Western European TBE (also known as Central European encephalitis) is endemic in western and central European countries and is expanding its range. - Mod.TY
