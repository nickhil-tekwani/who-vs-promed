EPIDEMICS AMONG AMAZONIAN INDIANS
=================================
News services are reporting outbreaks of measles and malaria among the
Yanomami Indians in the Venezuelan Amazon near the source of the
Orinoco River close to the border with Brazil.
Missionaries, the source of these reports, say at least 30 Yanomamis
have died since the beginning of the epidemics three months ago.
Because the Yanomamis burn their dead and pulversize the bones, and
because these indians have no counting system, the precise death toll will
be difficult to set.
