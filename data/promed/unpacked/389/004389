[In a recent media report (see posting 20180307.5670395), the national food safety agency in Bulgaria reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza on a farm in the northeastern district of Dobrich [Mon 5 Feb 2018]. The agency said that the virus, identified on a farm in the town of General Toshevo, located near the border with Romania, caused the death of 140 000 birds (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-birdflu-bulgaria/bulgaria-reports-outbreak-of-highly-pathogenic-h5n8-bird-flu-idUSKBN1GH1C1).

However, this information differs from that in the current official report sent to the OIE. The following information needs to be clarified:

Detail / OIE Report / Media Report
Serotype / HPAI H5 / HPAI H5N8
Affected population / 13 900 birds / 140 000 birds

There is a high likelihood that this outbreak is caused by the HPAI H5N8 subtype. However, clarification on the points mentioned above are important and kindly requested.

Furthermore, the official OIE report mentions that the reason for notification is that it is a "First occurrence of a listed disease." However, HPAI has been previously reported in Bulgaria, particularly HPAI H5N8, which was reported as recently as October-December 2017 in the districts of Dobrich, Haskovo, Sliven, Jambol and Stara Zagora (see event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25082. - Mod.CRD
