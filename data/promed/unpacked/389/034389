San Quentin State Prison was closed indefinitely to new inmates and
visitors on Wed 3 Jan 2007 as officials fought to contain a raging [viral]
gastroenteritis outbreak among roughly 500 convicts and staff members. The
virus, which was first detected on 28 Dec 2006, has spread to all of the
Marin County prison's housing units except a relatively isolated one with
15 inmates. On death row, about 1/4 of the prison's 620 condemned men have
become sick, officials said.
Results of lab tests were pending, but health officials said that given the
symptoms, they suspect norovirus, [previously] known as Norwalk virus. Most
of those sickened have experienced vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps,
headaches and fever. "We are doing everything we possibly can to stop this
illness so that it does not spread to the community and to ensure medical
staff can treat the inmate patients," said Warden Robert Ayers.
In addition to halting transfers out of the prison, Ayers has barred new
admissions. San Quentin's reception center for incoming inmates serves 17
Northern California counties, accepting about 400 new prisoners weekly.
Administrators expect it to remain closed for at least a week. Meanwhile,
the warden has suspended education and work programs to prevent the virus
from spreading further. Officials are using a bleach mixture to clean
common areas and distributing gloves and hand sanitizer to staff members.
Inmates with symptoms are being confined to their cells. No one has been
hospitalized, but some inmates have been given intravenous fluids,
officials said.
[Norovirus infection] is characterized by the sudden onset of violent
vomiting and diarrhea, with symptoms lasting one to 2 days. Common in
nursing homes, cruise ships and other settings where people share crowded
spaces, the virus is usually passed via [virus contaminated] doorknobs,
toilets or shared utensils. While norovirus infection can be fatal, the
more common outcome is severe dehydration.

[San Quentin is California's oldest and best known correctional
institution. The state's only death row for all male condemned inmates --
620 today, according to this report -- and the gas chamber where nowadays
the lethal injections are given, are located at San Quentin. Notorious
former inmates have been Charles Manson and Robert Kennedy's assassin,
Sirhan Sirhan. Details and photo at:
