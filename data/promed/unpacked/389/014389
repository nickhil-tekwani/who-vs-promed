Dear Colleagues,

The HealthMap team is proud to announce the upcoming Harvard
International Conference on Digital Disease Detection.

Internet technology has significantly changed the landscape of public
health surveillance and epidemic intelligence gathering. Sources
ranging from informal chat rooms, blogs, and web searches to news
media and formal online government announcements disseminate disease
data worldwide and in near real-time. This variety of electronic
sources including ProMED-mail creates an image of global health that
is fundamentally different than that created by traditional
surveillance methods.

Sponsored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this
conference will unite digital disease detection investigators and
practitioners in sharing novel sources of data, innovative methods of
data extraction and fusion, and their impacts on public health
practice. We hope that through this discussion, we will begin to
formalize this emerging field with a research agenda for future
efforts.

The conference is scheduled over 2 days: the afternoon of 16 Feb and
the morning of 17 Feb 2012. The 1st afternoon features keynote
speeches and rapid-fire presentations by attendees and committee
members. Following the rapid-fire presentations is a technology
demonstration, information swap, and reception to allow people to
share new methods of surveillance and to discuss the presentations in
more detail.

The following morning features 3 break out sessions which will serve
as opportunities to develop recommendations for forthcoming work:
Novel Sources of Data, Information Extract and Fusion, and Impact on
Public Health Practice.

For registration, abstract submission, and hotel reservations please
go to http://healthmap.org/ddd/.

Hope to see you there!
