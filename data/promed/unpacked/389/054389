EU's 1st 2009 bird flu case found in Germany
--------------------------------------------
Germany has informed the European Commission of an outbreak of H5N1
bird flu, the EU's 1st case of the lethal strain of the contagious
disease in poultry this year [2009].

The outbreak "was found in a wild duck shot during a hunt near the
town of Starnberg in the German state of Bavaria," the European
Union's executive arm said in a statement.

The district office in Starnberg, just southwest of Munich, said in a
statement the duck was shot on [10 Jan 2009] and tested as part of an
EU-wide monitoring programme. None of the 39 birds shot on the hunt
showed signs of illness.

Experts said the positive test was not surprising as wild birds are a
natural 'virus reservoir', the Starnberg district office added.
"Individual positive findings in the framework of the monitoring of
wild birds are, furthermore, to be expected," the office said.

"There are no indications that during the last 8 weeks a highly
pathogenic virus has, directly or indirectly via a wild bird, been
introduced into a poultry stock, or carried on from there," the
district office added.

"There are so far no indications of the virus spreading in the wild
bird population," the office said.

The Starnberg authorities had not made any area off-limits or set up
a monitoring area following the positive test. "On basis of the
favourable result of a risk assessment, Germany may refrain from the
establishment of a control area and a surrounding monitoring area
around a positive finding," the European Commission said in its statement.

The last wild-bird case of bird flu in the 27-nation bloc was found
in a Canadian goose in Britain in February last year [2008], while
the last outbreak in poultry of H5N1 in the EU was detected last
October [2008] in the German state of Saxony.

[Germany submitted on 10 Mar 2009 an immediate notification to the
OIE addressing the case above. The following information is derived
from the said notification:
1. Affected population: one of 39 wild ducks shot in January [2009]
was positive for HPAI H5N1, 38 were negative for influenza A.
2. Epidemiological comments: the place where the birds were killed is
inside a risk zone, thus free-range holding of poultry is forbidden.
There are no poultry holdings in the neighbourhood.

3rd H7 strain of avian flu found in Japan
-----------------------------------------
A 3rd Aichi prefecture farm has been tested positive for the H7
strain of bird flu virus, the Japanese Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries Ministry said Wednesday [11 Mar 2009].

The government departments are trying to identify what N-subtype the
virus belongs to, the ministry said in a press release.

The 3rd case of avian flu virus was also found on a quail farm in
Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, where 2 weak-virulent H7N6 subtype of
bird flu virus were identified since the end of February [2009].

The quail farm tested positive raises about 110 000 birds and has
been quarantined for further investigation.

The prefectural government has limited the outflow of egg products
from 2 farms near the quail farm.

[Most likely, the causative agent in the new case will be similar to
the previous ones, namely LPNAI H7N6. Confirmation is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
