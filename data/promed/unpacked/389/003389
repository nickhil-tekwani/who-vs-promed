Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever claims life of live-stock trader
--------------------------------------------------------
A 49-year-old patient died at a Karachi Hospital -- the second one this year -- after he was tested positive for the fatal Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection late on Thursday night. The authorities did not give the name of the deceased. The man reported by the media to be a live-stock trader was brought to city's Patel Hospital on 7 Aug 2012 after having gone to Balochistan on business. He was suffering from high fever and bleeding and tested positive for the dreaded disease at another hospital's laboratory.

The Dengue Surveillance Cell of Sindh Health Department, confirmed to the media that so far six confirmed CCHF cases have been reported in the province this year and three of them had gone to Balochistan and probably got infected there.

[Previously on 24 Jun 2012 it was reported that the World Health Organisation (WHO) had expressed concern over recent outbreaks of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in some parts of Pakistan For a comprehensive account of the current situation, see ProMED-mail post: "Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Pakistan (03): (BA & QA) WHO 20120625.1180202". According to the WHO Weekly Epidemiological Bulletin, 22 suspected cases of CCHF were reported throughout the country, of which 15 cases were confirmed, leading to 5 deaths this year [2012]. Up to that time 15 cases had originated in Balochistan. The above report from Karachi indicates that the risk of contraction of CCHF infection for people working with live-stock in Balochistan remains high. Furthermore diagnosis and treatment of CCHF in Pakistan remains unsatisfactory.

Balochistan (or Baluchistan) is the largest of the four provinces of Pakistan, constituting approximately 44% of its total land mass, but in terms of population, it's the smallest province of Pakistan. It is bordered by Afghanistan to the north and northwest, Iran to the southwest, Punjab and Sindh to the east, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the northeast. The Arabian Sea borders it to the south.The interactive HealthMap of Pakistan can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/1iGJ.
