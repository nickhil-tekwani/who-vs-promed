Japanese encephalitis has killed 185 people in India this year
[2007], the mosquito-borne disease claiming 115 lives in Assam alone,
and a UN official has sought a more focused immunization drive.
According to the Health Ministry, up to 16 Aug 2007, 9 states
reported 837 cases of the disease commonly known as brain fever.
Deaths were reported from 4 states.
Uttar Pradesh reported 383 cases, Assam 368, Goa 44, Tamil Nadu 17,
Manipur 11, Karnataka and Haryana 6 each. Kerala and Andhra Pradesh
reported one case each. Among the patients was a Nepalese national
who was diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis at the Gorakhpur Medical
College of Uttar Pradesh, close to the Nepal border.
Japanese encephalitis can affect the central nervous system and cause
severe complications like paralysis, coma and finally death.
According to the World Health Organization, the disease is fatal in
up to 30 percent of cases, and there is a possibility that those who
survive may be disabled for life.
UN officials say India can do much more to combat the disease. Marzio
Babille, chief of the health wing at the UNICEF office here said:
"India produces only a 10th of the vaccine doses required for the
country. India has good expertise to produce desired vaccines, but
they need to prioritize them. A good national immunization plan,
adequate doses of vaccine, and ability of the government to
investigate thoroughly and carry out surveillance are a few things
required to handle the disease," Babille told IANS. He said that
although the mosquito was the primary reason for Japanese
encephalitis, horses and pigs were the reservoirs of the virus.
"Many rural people in Gorakhpur are living in close proximity to
pigs, and this could be one of the reasons why many cases are
reported from this district of Uttar Pradesh," the official said. He
added that lack of consistent focus in the immunization drive in
Assam was a key reason for the high mortality in the state. Of the
185 deaths, the highest toll was in Assam, and Uttar Pradesh was next
with 65. While 3 people died in Haryana, 2 succumbed to the fever in Manipur.
Babille, however, said that the number of deaths across India had
gone down and that efforts must now be made to reach "zero mortality
level." A health ministry official said the main bottleneck in
tackling the disease was a "cocktail of lack of awareness among our
rural population and vaccine."
He said the most affected state of Uttar Pradesh had established a
regional office of the health and family welfare department at
Gorakhpur with support from the central government. "The aim is to
strengthen epidemiological and entomological surveillance in the
eastern belt of Uttar Pradesh," he said. Authorities said they have
extended the Japanese encephalitis vaccination program from 11
districts across 4 states in 2006 to 29 endemic districts across 9 states.
