The incidence of curly top disease on cultivated plants and weeds was
investigated in Kerman Province (southeastern Iran) from October 2003
to November 2004. A total of 1186 samples were collected in fields of
sugar beet and other crops as well as within commercial plastic houses.
Curtovirus infection of 4 field crops, 3 vegetables, and 11 weeds was
verified by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using
a polyclonal antibody.
An undescribed curtovirus, tentatively designated Iranian beet curly
top virus (IBCTV), was isolated from 3 symptomatic beet samples
collected randomly in widely separated regions of south-eastern,
southern, and central Iran and used for molecular studies.
A 672 bp segment of the coat protein (CP) gene of each isolate was
amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. The
results showed that the 3 isolates shared 98.5-98.7 percent
nucleotide homology with each other but only 72.1-76.5 percent with
other members of the genus _Curtovirus_. IBCTV was also detected by
PCR using specific primers in other samples of sugar beet, tomato,
spinach, turnip, and several weed species collected in different
parts of Iran. These results indicated that IBCTV is the dominant
curtovirus in Iran.

[Virus species in the genus _Curtovirus_ (family _Geminiviridae_) are
transmitted by insects (for example leafhoppers or whiteflies) and
grafting. They often have a wide host range including crop and weed
species, which may serve as reservoirs for both the pathogens and
vectors. Disease management includes vector control and the use of
resistant crop cultivars if available.
