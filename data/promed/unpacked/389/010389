LIBRARY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR OVERSEAS LIBRARIES
=================================================
Date: April 10, 1997
From: Art Lamey <alamey@ndsuext.nodak.edu>

The Library Assistance Program, Office of International
Programs, American Phytopathological Society (APS), receives
donations of back issues of journals from retired plant
pathologists, locates institutions that need them, and arranges
shipment of the journals at no cost to the receiving
institution, unless there might be some local costs once the
shipment arrives in country. However, since we usually ship by
mail bag, in-country costs are unlikely.
Most of our collections of back issues of journals are of
Phytopathology and Plant Disease. Occasionally we also receive
back issues of Plant Disease Reporter. This was last published
in 1979, and Plant Disease was first published in 1980. Recently
we had our first offer to donate Molecular Plant-Microbe
Interactions. We receive back issues that cover varying time
periods, such as 1980-1996, 1975-1996, 1965-1996, 1960-1996 and
even 1955-1996.
At any given moment we usually have some sets of journals in
storage at APS Headquarters and other sets are being donated by
retiring members. Some sets of journals can be shipped directly
to the receiving institution if we have an up-to-date list of
requests from those institutions.
DO YOU NEED BACK ISSUES OF JOURNALS? We have lists of requests
for journals, but many of the requests are several years old.
Institutions that would like back issues of journals are
invited to contact Art Lamey, co-chair, Library Assistance
Program. Let me know which journals you want and the
approximate time period (see above) that you want covered by the
back issues. Please make certain that your mailing address is
correct. My e-mail and FAX numbers are listed below, in case
you wish to communicate in this way. If you have e-mail
addresses and/or FAX numbers, let us use them, as this makes
communication faster and easier.
