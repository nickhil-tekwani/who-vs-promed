The government of Mexico reported this Friday, 4 Oct 2013, that 79 cases of cholera have occurred and one person died from this disease, which had not presented in the country for a decade, while Nicaragua and Guatemala announced alerts.

In the state of Hidalgo, "77 cases in total" have occurred, said the federal Secretariat of Health, Mercedes Juan, during a press conference. The office of the assistant secretary for Health of Hidalgo, Ana Maria Tavares, said that these 77 cases joined 2 others confirmed in the neighboring Federal District of Mexico City, with a total of 79. Tavares acknowledged that "the strain is the same that circulates in Caribbean countries such as Haiti, Cuba and Dominican Republic."

Guatemala decreed a health alert in 4 departments that border with Mexico related to the outbreak of cholera, although for the moment there have been no recorded cases. For its part, Nicaragua noted outbreaks of acute diarrhea, and is strengthening the epidemiological surveillance at its borders.
