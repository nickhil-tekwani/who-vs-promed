Red Cross volunteers in Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal
-------------------------------------------------------
"We had an incident in Gueckedou, the epicenter of the outbreak in Guinea, recently where people carrying knives surrounded one of our marked Red Cross vehicles," says Aliou Boly, operations manager, IFRC [International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies], Guinea. "It is not the 1st time we have had such an incident, and it likely will not be the last. However, contrary to some media reports, we did not shut down operations. Instead, we talked with the communities to try and resolved the situation. Education really is the key to stopping this disease in its tracks."

The Red Cross has launched emergency operations in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, through which more than 2000 volunteers are being trained and mobilized to share key messages of prevention and protection. In neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal, a further 686 volunteers have been sharing similar messages for the past 2 months, to prepare communities should the virus spread further across the region.

"The Red Cross is well placed to raise awareness of Ebola in the very remote communities where the virus has surfaced or has the potential to surface," says Dr Adinoyi Adeiza, IFRC health coordinator in Africa. "We have volunteers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone who live and work in these communities. They are trusted members of their community and they are listened to. However, we cannot do this on our own. It is imperative that community leaders and elders work with us to ensure messages of prevention and protection reach the intended audience."

[2] Nigeria: prevention

The [Nigerian] House of Representatives, on Wednesday [2 Jul 2014], urged the Federal Government, through the Ministry of Health, to take proactive measures to ensure that the deadly Ebola virus disease did not spread to Nigeria. The House equally mandated its committees on Health and Disaster Preparedness to immediately monitor the Ministry of Health on the steps taken to prevent the virus from entering Nigeria.

Continuing, Honourable Chinda said the cause of Ebola virus disease had been traced to unsafe burial practices in West Africa, saying that, "it will be most appropriate if we start putting measures in place to avoid the most dreaded disease in the world from entering our country since it has ravaged Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Mali, Ivory Coast and others."

[3] Plea for drug testing

Victims of a deadly Ebola virus disease epidemic, which is out of control in West Africa, could be treated with experimental drugs to see if they are effective, the head of a London-based health charity said last night [2 Jul 2014]. Jeremy Farrar, a professor of tropical medicine, said trialling drugs that had not been fully tested would be better than "tepid sponging" and the promise of a proper burial, which is all doctors can offer at present. "It's ridiculous that we haven't got these products out of labs and animal trials and into human testing, and at least offered to people," he said.

[It is good news that the Guinean Red Cross is persisting in spite of threats, and in carrying out prevention activities in other countries in the region.

African countries have always objected to being used as "human guinea pigs" in new drug trials, but maybe they will make an exception in the case of ebolavirus.
