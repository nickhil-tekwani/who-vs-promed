new bipartite begomovirus infecting tomato in Cuba. BSPP New Disease
Reports, vol. 19: February-August 2009]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In Cuba, the monopartite _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV) is
the most wide-spread begomovirus infecting tomato that causes the
major losses in all production areas, although 2 bipartite
begomoviruses affecting tomatoes have been identified. In January
2007, symptoms of yellow mottle and leaf distortion appeared on
tomato plants across eastern Cuba. These symptoms differ from those
caused by TYLCV in lacking the typical leaf curling.

DNA from 35 symptomatic leaf samples was tested using PCR. The
absence of TYLCV was demonstrated in 4 DNA samples which showed the
presence of a bipartite begomovirus. These samples showed strong
hybridisation signals with _Pepper golden mosaic virus_ genes under
low stringency conditions. The positive samples were sequenced and
showed the typical genome organization of bipartite begomoviruses.
The sequence was compared with those from other begomoviruses and
showed less than 89 percent nucleotide sequence identity (the species
demarcation threshold) to all previously reported begomoviruses. The
highest identity (83.9 percent) was with Wissadula golden mosaic St
Thomas virus.

The data indicate that the begomovirus infecting tomato is a new
species for which we propose the name Tomato yellow leaf distortion
virus (ToYLDV). Additional work is now needed to determine the
distribution of this new virus in tomato production areas of the
country and to quantify the losses it causes.

[Ref: E Fiallo-Olive et al: Tobacco yellow crinkle virus, a new
bipartite begomovirus infecting tobacco and pepper in Cuba. BSPP New
Disease Reports, vol. 19: February-August 2009]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently 2 bipartite begomoviruses have been reported infecting
tobacco in the country, Tobacco leaf rugose virus (TbLRV) and Tobacco
leaf curl Cuba virus (TbLCuCUV). In January 2007, foliar yellowing
and crinkling symptoms appeared on tobacco plants in eastern Cuba.

DNA from 7 leaf samples showing symptoms tested by PCR for _Tomato
yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV) demonstrated the absence of TYLCV,
the most widespread begomovirus in the region. All 7 samples showed
amplification for genome components DNA A and B (amplicons of
approximately 1.1 and 0.6 kb, respectively) demonstrating the
presence of bipartite begomovirus. The same samples showed strong
hybridisation signals with _Pepper golden mosaic virus_ genes under
low stringency conditions. The positive samples were sequenced and
showed 100 percent identity [with each other]. The genome
organization was typical of that of the DNA-A components of bipartite
begomoviruses originating from the New World. The sequence was
compared with those of other begomoviruses and showed less than 88
percent nucleotide sequence identity to all previously reported
begomoviruses. The highest levels of identity were with _Cabbage leaf
curl virus_ (81.9 percent), TbLCuCUV (74 percent), and with TbLRV
(73.9 percent).

At the same time foliar yellow mottle symptoms were observed on sweet
pepper plants (_Capsicum annuum_) in eastern Cuba and the presence of
a bipartite begomovirus was demonstrated. The DNA-A component of the
virus from one sample was cloned and sequenced. This showed 99.3
percent nucleotide sequence identity to the virus from tobacco. Thus
the virus identified in both tobacco and pepper is a new begomovirus
species for which the name Tobacco yellow crinkle virus (TbYCV) is
proposed.

[Begomoviruses (family _Geminiviridae_) affect many economically
important crops causing symptoms often including leaf yellowing,
distortion, stunting, reduced plant vigour, and significant yield
losses. They are transmitted by different whitefly species (which are
a serious pest in themselves) and many may also be transmitted by
mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted.
Disease management of begomoviruses may include use of certified
virus-free plant material and other means of pathogen exclusion, as
well as control of the vector and possible pathogen and/or vector
reservoir plants. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in
open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range
of whiteflies. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus
resistance are available.

Wissadula golden mosaic St Thomas virus, Tobacco leaf rugose virus
and Tobacco leaf curl Cuba virus have at present been registered only
as tentative members of the genus by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
