Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - WHO Update 98
------------------------------------
As of 25 Apr 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 17919 deaths. The WHO
is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through frequent
consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and Member States and
through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update:
-----------------
The current situation is largely unchanged since the last update. The
most active areas of transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus
continue to be parts of West and Central Africa with some focal areas
of activity in South and Southeast Asia. Pandemic influenza activity
H1N1 remains low in much of the temperate areas of both the northern
and southern hemispheres. Seasonal influenza type B virus is the
predominant influenza virus, though also at low levels of
circulation, across East Asia, Northern and Eastern Europe. Influenza
type B viruses have also been detected in Central Africa and this
week in West Africa. Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have continued
to be detected in South and Southeast Asia, as well as sporadically
in some countries of West and Central Africa, and Eastern Europe.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, data from a limited number of countries
suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus is
declining across West and West-central Africa. Ghana is reporting
moderate amounts of pandemic virus (16 percent of all clinical
specimens tested were positive for pandemic influenza) but smaller
numbers of cases continue to be detected in Senegal, Niger and
Cameroon. In East Africa, influenza activity has returned to low
levels. Only Rwanda has detected small numbers of pandemic virus in
the past week. In addition, a few seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses are
seen in Ghana. Influenza type B has been increasingly detected in the
area, notably in Ghana and Cameroon.

In East Asia, pandemic influenza H1N1 virus circulation is now
sporadic. In China, Mongolia, and Republic of Korea most influenza
like illness cases continued to be primarily due to seasonal
influenza type B viruses. In China and Mongolia influenza detections
have continued to decline compared to previous recent weeks. The
Republic of Korea reported increasing levels of respiratory disease
activity associated with increasing detections of seasonal influenza
type B in respiratory specimens over 5 consecutive weeks. Of note,
small numbers of pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal H3N2 and H1N1
viruses continued to be sporadically detected in some countries of the region.

In Southeast Asia, overall levels of influenza activity were low.
Although the predominant influenza virus circulating was still
pandemic influenza H1N1, there was co-circulation of seasonal
influenza type B and, to a lesser extent, H3N2 viruses in several
countries including Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand.
Malaysia has reported increasing levels of respiratory
diseases activity associated with pandemic influenza H1N1 laboratory
confirmed cases. Media sources have also reported school closures in
the country. In Singapore, influenza-like-illness levels are still
below the seasonal epidemic threshold but have increased compared to
previous week.

In South Asia, Bangladesh reported an increase in respiratory
diseases activity associated with increasing numbers of pandemic
influenza H1N1 laboratory confirmed cases since beginning of April
2010. India reported pandemic influenza activity in the states of
Maharashtra and recently Karnataka. Levels of respiratory diseases
activity in both of these countries appear much less intense than in
the initial wave of transmission which occurred late 2009. Although
pandemic influenza is the predominant virus circulating in the
region, seasonal influenza type B viruses continued to be detected in
Iran and Bangladesh.

In the tropical zone of the Americas, limited data suggested that
pandemic influenza H1N1 activity remains low but with a few localized
areas of transmission. Jamaica, Panama and Guatemala, reported
increasing trends in respiratory disease activity. In Cuba, all
provinces reported an increase in numbers of acute respiratory
diseases cases in the last two weeks, mainly from the city of Havana.
In Peru, the number of pneumonia cases in children under 5 years of
age in Lima has been increasing since 6 consecutive weeks and
remained above the epidemic threshold. However, the extent to which
these pneumonia cases have been due to pandemic influenza H1N1 virus
is not known. Notably, respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) has been
reported to be circulating in the area.

In the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, overall pandemic
influenza H1N1 activity remained low. In United States, the
proportion of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness was below
the national baseline. No influenza B is reported by countries of
North America. In Europe, pandemic influenza activity is at very low
intensity in all countries. The overall proportion of sentinel
respiratory samples testing positive for influenza remained stable at
about 4.5 percent. For the current week, the total number of sentinel
influenza B detections continued to exceed that of influenza A,
mainly due to viral detections from Eastern Europe: Central,
Siberian, Far Eastern regions of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.

In the temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere, influenza-like
illness activity remained low and at the levels experienced at the
same time in previous years. Australia has continued to report
sporadic detections of pandemic influenza H1N1, seasonal influenza B
and H3N2 viruses in low numbers in recent weeks.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal, and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the
potential to infect, humans including seasonal influenza.

For this reporting week (15-28 April 2010), no additional cases of
oseltamivir resistant pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 viruses have
been reported. The cumulative total remains at 285 so far. All but
one of these have the H275Y substitution and are assumed to remain
sensitive to zanamivir.

The countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly
reported their 1st pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases since the
last web update (No. 97): none.

The countries and overseas territories/communities that have newly
reported their 1st deaths among pandemic (H1N1) 2009 confirmed cases

* The reported number of fatal cases is an under representation of
the actual numbers as many deaths are never tested or recognized as
influenza related.

[A feature of the weekly updates is a map of influenza activity
and virus subtypes, accessible at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/Global_influenzapositive_FluTransmissionZones_week05.png>.
The displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to Flunet
(<http://gamapserver.who.int/GlobalAtlas/home.asp>), WHO regional
offices, or on Ministry of health websites in the preceding 2 weeks.

In summary, the most active areas of transmission of pandemic
influenza H1N1 virus continue to be parts of West and Central Africa
with some focal areas of activity in South and Southeast Asia.
Pandemic influenza activity H1N1 remains low in much of the temperate
areas of both the northern and southern hemispheres. The pandemic
(H1N1) virus has largely displaced the previous seasonal (H1N1) strain.

Seasonal influenza type B virus is the predominant influenza virus,
though also at low levels of circulation, across East Asia, Northern
and Eastern Europe.

Seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses have continued to be detected in
South and Southeast Asia, as well as sporadically in some countries
of West and Central Africa, and Eastern Europe.

The global total number of fatalities due to influenza pandemic
(H1N1) virus infection has increased by 121 since the previous update
of 17 Apr 2010. - Mod.CP]
