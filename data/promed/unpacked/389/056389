The Oswego County Health Department confirmed on Friday [12 Aug 2011]
that a child has contracted eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus.
This is the 1st human case detected this year [2011]. Earlier in the
day [12 Aug 2011], health department officials announced they had
detected the virus in another mosquito pool, making it the 3rd to test
positive in the past month.

Mosquito pools have tested positive in the following areas of Oswego
County: town of Albion, West Monroe's Toad Harbor Big Bay Swamp; the
townships of Palermo, Volney, and Hastings; and the village of Central
Square.

Officials say the best way to protect yourself and your family is to
stay away from where mosquitoes concentrate and to limit outdoor
activity at dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active. Oswego
County's public health director Dr Norfleet says: "People need to be
particularly cautious against the virus now, because, historically,
more human cases of the EEE virus have presented themselves during the
month of August."

There are no plans to conduct spraying at this time. The health
department will continue to monitor the situation and re-evaluate the
need for spraying.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Pollack for sending in this report.

EEE virus transmission has been active in New York this year (2011). A
previous equine case in Oneida county, New York was reported earlier
this month (August 2011).

The above report is the 1st human case in the USA that ProMED-mail has
posted so far this year (2011). No EEE virus vaccine is commercially
available for human use, but there is one for horses. Avoidance of
mosquito bites is the only preventive measure for avoidance of EEE
virus infections in humans.
