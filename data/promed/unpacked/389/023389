[Although the graphs in the report above clearly show that the Lassa fever virus transmission peak passed for the latter part of 2018, the 22 new confirmed cases indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is increasing as Nigeria enters the new period of time when an increase in cases usually occurs. Fortunately, no healthcare workers were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak was widespread in 2018, occurring in 23 states and 93 local government areas.

It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this area.

Images of the rodent reservoirs of Lassa fever virus can be seen as follows:

_M. erythroleucus_ and _Hylomyscus pamfi_: http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time.
