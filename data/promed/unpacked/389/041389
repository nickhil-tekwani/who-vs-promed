Outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections linked to bagged salad mix
--------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last case count update on 26 Jun 2020, 303 new laboratory-confirmed _Cyclospora_ infections have been reported.

As of 8 Jul 2020, a total of 509 people with laboratory-confirmed _Cyclospora_ infections associated with this outbreak have been reported from 8 states: Illinois (151), Iowa (160), Kansas (5), Minnesota (63), Missouri (46), Nebraska (48), North Dakota (6), and Wisconsin (30).

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 11 May 2020 to 1 Jul 2020. Ill people range in age from 11 to 92 years with a median age of 60, and 53% are female. Of 506 people with available information, 33 people (7%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 4 to 6 weeks. If the number of cases reported by the CDC is different from the number reported by state or local health officials, data reported by local jurisdictions should be considered the most up to date. Any differences may be due to the timing of reporting and website updates.

Additionally, the Public Health Agency of Canada is investigating an outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections occurring in 3 Canadian provinces where exposure to certain Fresh Express brand salad products containing iceberg lettuce, carrots and red cabbage has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence continues to indicate that bagged salad mix containing iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage produced by Fresh Express is a likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the 2 weeks before they became ill. Ill people reported eating a variety of brands of bagged salad mix containing iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage. Salad mixes eaten by ill people were purchased from ALDI, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco, and Walmart stores in the Midwest.

Traceback investigations by the FDA suggest that the Streamwood, Illinois Fresh Express production facility is the likely producer of the bagged salad mixes eaten by ill people. The FDA has begun an inspection at this facility. The CDC and FDA continue to investigate to determine which ingredient or ingredients in the salad mix were contaminated and whether other products are a source of illnesses.

Fresh Express's _Cyclospora_ outbreak now spans 8 states and 3 provinces
------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Editor's note: Late this afternoon [9 Jul 2020] the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its patient count for this outbreak. The US patient count has topped 500, now standing at 509.

A troublesome _Cyclospora_ outbreak continues to grow in North America with 37 confirmed cases in Canada added to 206* in the Midwest USA. _Cyclospora_ is a coccidian parasite that causes diarrheal disease in humans called cyclosporiasis.

The update today [9 Jul 2020] involves an outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections traced to Fresh Express bagged garden salad products containing lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage.

As of 8 Jul 2020, there were 37 confirmed cases of _Cyclospora_ illness linked to this outbreak in 3 Canadian provinces: Ontario (26), Quebec (10), and Newfoundland and Labrador (1). Canadians became sick between mid-May and mid-June [2020]. One Canadian has been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 21 and 70 years of age. The majority of cases, 76%, are female.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with provincial public health authorities, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada to investigate the outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections occurring in 3 provinces. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported to PHAC.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to certain Fresh Express brand salad products containing iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage has been identified as a likely source of the outbreak. Some of the individuals who became sick reported having eaten Fresh Express brand salad products containing these ingredients before their illnesses occurred. The source of illness for the remaining individuals continues to be under investigation.

On 28 Jun 2020, the CFIA issued a food recall for certain Fresh Express brand salad products containing iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage that were distributed nationally in Canada. The recalled salad products begin with lot code "Z177" or a lower number and have best before dates up to and including 8-14 Jul 2020. For more information on the recalled product, please consult the CFIA's website.

Canadians are advised not to eat the recalled products. Retailers and foodservice establishments are advised not to sell or serve the recalled products, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using these products. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If additional products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

The recalled products can be identified by looking for the Product Code, located in the upper right-hand corner of the front of the package. The recall includes products marked with the letter "Z" at the beginning of the Product Code, followed by the number "178" or lower.

[Cyclosporiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/) is an intestinal illness caused by the microscopic parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite. People living or traveling in countries where cyclosporiasis is endemic may be at increased risk of infection. Infected people shed unsporulated (non-infective; immature) _C. cayetanensis_ oocysts in their stool; immature oocysts usually require at least 1 to 2 weeks under favorable laboratory conditions to sporulate and become infective.

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range, 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of sporulated oocysts (the infective form of the parasite).

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis may include the following:
- Watery diarrhea (most common)
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss
- Cramping
- Bloating
- Increased gas
- Nausea
- Fatigue

Other symptoms that may occur but are less common include the following:
- Vomiting
- Low-grade fever

If a person ill from cyclosporiasis is not treated, symptoms can persist for several weeks to a month or more. Some symptoms, such as diarrhea, can return; some symptoms, such as fatigue, may continue after the gastrointestinal symptoms have gone away. The infection usually is not life-threatening. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms, particularly persons from areas where cyclosporiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions. - Mod.LL
