From December 2016 to date (31 Jan 2017), 4 outbreaks of sheep pox and goat pox have been confirmed in the island of Lesvos.

The 1st outbreak was observed in a flock of 114 sheep/goats in Perama (Geras), and was laboratory-confirmed on 9 Dec 2016. The next day all animals were culled.

The 2nd outbreak was observed on 26 Dec 2016 in a flock of 379 sheep in the community of Skopelos (Mavros Lakkos) about 7 km [about 4.4 mi] from the 1st affected flock.

A suspect 3rd outbreak occurred in [28 Dec 2016] in a flock of 58 sheep in the community of Perama (Palaiokipos). The disease in these 2 outbreaks was confirmed on [30 Dec 2016] and all animals were culled.

A 4th outbreak was observed on [9 Jan 2017] in a flock of 213 sheep and 17 goats in Perama. The diagnosis was confirmed on [13 Jan 2017]. All animals in the flock were also destroyed.

The outbreak reports do not mention any affected goats in the mixed flocks (outbreaks 1st and 4th). Additionally, articles published in regional newspapers of Lesvos Island describe clinical signs in sheep and nothing for goats.

[During Greece's earlier "sheep pox and goat pox" epizootic (2013-2014), their OIE report commendably differentiated between the epidemiological statistics of the 2 species (sheep, goats), even in mixed flocks. This allowed assessment of the virus strain involved (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15513.)
