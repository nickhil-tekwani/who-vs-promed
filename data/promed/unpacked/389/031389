1st SBV case in goats
---------------------
A goat farm in Dalfsen, Overijssel, initially suspected, has been
confirmed Schmallenberg-virus [SBV] positive by the new Netherlands
Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (nVWA). It is the 1st goat
farm where the virus has been demonstrated. A 2nd goat farm with
malformed kids is still under investigation.

The number of SBV-confirmed sheep farms has risen to 33. The provinces
of Utrecht and Flevoland are the only ones so far not found affected.
In these provinces, the number of suspected farms was also the lowest,
3 and 1 respectively.

The province of Gelderland has been the affected most, with 26
reported suspicions of which 9 have been SBV confirmed.

The total number of farms which reported malformed offspring has risen
to 126, including 49 cattle, 75 sheep, and 2 goat farms. None of the
23 cattle farms already tested has been found infected. On 10 sheep
farms, the virus was not demonstrated while 33 sheep farms have been
found infected. Investigations are still pending on samples from 32
sheep and 26 cattle farms.

[For the location of Dalfsen, see map at

The Dutch official requirement for notification of malformations in
ruminants seems to be effective, producing an impressive reporting
harvest (though no denominator is available). Looking at the map and
observing the widespread distribution of (most probably, vectorborne)
cases throughout the country, it is difficult to perceive a lower
incidence in neighbouring German and Belgian territories.

According to the published results of Belgium's investigations as of
30 Dec 2011, out of 20 ruminant animal farms with congenital
malformations, 9 were found positive. This included 8 cattle farms
(all negative), 11 sheep farms (9 positive), and 1 negative goat
farm.

The negative results in cattle farms in the 3 affected countries
(according to Dutch official information, one cattle case has been
confirmed in Germany) is in need of explanation; hopefully, more light
will be shed on SBV during next week's discussions of EU's "Standing
Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health" (SCOFCAH), to take
place in Brussels on 11 Jan 2012. - Mod.AS]
