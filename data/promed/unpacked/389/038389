[3] France: familial Mpox virus involving 2 young children
Date: Fri 23 Dec 2022

ref: Del Giudice P, Fribourg A, Roudiere L, et al. Familial mpox virus infection involving 2 young children. Emerg Infect Dis. 2023; 29(2)
------------------------------------------------------------
Mpox virus (MPXV) is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus. An outbreak of MPXV infections emerged in the spring of 2022 outside Africa, mainly in Europe and the United States, such that on 23 Jul 2022, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern. During this outbreak, MPXV spread has disproportionately affected gay or bisexual men or other men who have sex with men, which suggests transmission through sexual or intimate contact. However, in August 2022, we observed intrafamilial transmission of the virus to all members of a family (father, mother, and 2 children) in France.

The father, aged 30 years, showed a few papular pustules on his body, including his penis. The pustules began appearing on 17 Jul 2022. A pustule sample was tested for MPXV and showed a positive PCR result. The wife of the man showed a few pustules on 2 Aug 2022 that were later confirmed to be positive for MPXV by PCR. She had no mucous signs. Both persons were HIV negative.

The couple and their 2 young daughters went on vacation to a campsite in southern France on 6 Aug 2022. Their 4 year old daughter had a fever (temperature 38 C [100.4 F]) and a skin eruption that began on 5 Aug 2022, which consisted of 3 types of lesions: an umbilical pustule, papular pustules on an erythematous basis, and a disseminated faint erythematous macula. She also had bilateral conjunctivitis but no lymphadenopathy or mucosal lesions.

On 9 Aug 2022, her 7 year old sister showed [approximately? - Mod.JH] 10 asymptomatic micropapular pustules on a discrete erythematous basis. She had no fever, mucosal lesion, or lymphadenopathy.

The family was residing at a campsite in southern France, where there is a high burden of _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes. They were suspected of having either MPXV infection or _Aedes_ sp. mosquito bites. A skin scraping from the skin of a micropapular pustule was positive for MPXV by PCR. For all family members, only 1 lesion/person was sampled. Onset symptoms and positive PCR results are shown in the timeline. The family received isolation instructions and returned home on 11 Aug 2022. The outcome was favorable for all 4 persons. There were no secondary cases at the campsite.

During the ongoing outbreak, cases of MPXV infection in young children have been extremely rare. US data from CDC as of 7 Oct 2022, reported 26 577 cases in 28 patients (0.1%) <12 years of age. Those data were confirmed in Europe. As of 3 Aug 2022, among 4663 laboratory-confirmed cases of MPXV infection reported in Spain, only 4 (0.1%) were in children <4 years of age (7, 10, and 13 months, and 3 years) and 12 were in adolescents 13-17 years of age. As of 23 Aug 2022, a total of 41 countries in the World Health Organization European Region have reported 21 098 cases, of which 15 (0.07%) were in persons <15 years of age.

Intrafamilial transmission to all family members including both children also appears extremely rare in the 2022 outbreak. We assume that the transmission route was through household direct skin-to-skin contact with their parents.

The clinical signs shown by the children were mild, and clinical diagnosis would be extremely difficult in the absence of knowledge of the MPXV infection of the father. Case reports in young children have been extremely rare in this outbreak. Thus, a dermatologic description is lacking in this population. The 2 children in this report had mild general signs. Skin lesions consisted of a few umbilical pustules or papulopustules similar to those reported. However, the children also had discrete micropapular pustules on an erythematous basis similar to mosquito bites and a faint erythematous rash. Such skin lesions have rarely been reported in children or adults.

Dr Del Giudice is a physician in the Infectious Diseases and Dermatology Unit at Bonnet Hospital, Frejus, France. His primary research interest is skin infections.

[The mild signs in the children in this report are particularly concerning as had the parents also not had symptoms, would they have been tested for mpox, or would it have been ignored as chickenpox, hand-foot-mouth virus, or something else? - Mod.JH]

[4] USA: occupational mpox virus transmission to healthcare worker

ref: Alarcón J, Kim M, Balanji N, et al. Occupational monkeypox virus transmission to healthcare worker, California, USA, 2022. Emerg Infect Dis. 2022; 29(2)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Risk for transmission of [mpox] virus (MPXV) (clade IIb), the causative agent of mpox (formerly monkeypox), to healthcare workers (HCWs) is considered to be low, and although many cases have been reported among HCWs, only a few have been occupationally acquired. We report a case of non-needle stick MPXV transmission to an HCW in California, USA.

The HCW was a 40 year old female physician with a medical history significant for rheumatoid arthritis (treated with etanercept). In August 2022, she experienced a prodrome of myalgia and fatigue, followed by a mild headache. 2 days later, she noticed a small, raised skin lesion on her left middle finger. The skin lesion progressed to a blister and developed umbilication; it grew to 1.5-2 cm, and a swab sample for MPXV was collected on day 6 of illness. On days 9 and 10 after symptom onset, the HCW experienced fever for 48 hours, followed by a cough and sore throat. A total of 10 skin lesions developed throughout her body, including her right arm, ankles, lateral breast, back of the neck, and upper back. She received a 2-week course of oral tecovirimat, experienced no complications, and completely recovered.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services conducted a contact investigation. This activity was reviewed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and was conducted in accordance with applicable federal law and CDC policy.

The HCW works as a physician at 2 clinics that primarily serve LGBTQ+ and HIV-positive patients. She sees 15 patients/day and regularly sees patients with mpox, during which she wears full personal protective equipment (PPE) (N95 respirator, a gown, and eye protection). During the presumed incubation period, the HCW interacted with 2 patients (patients A and B) who did not undergo triage per clinic protocols for suspected infection with MPXV, but according to the HCW's interview, had symptoms concerning for MPXV infection. The HCW saw patient A 29 days before her own symptom onset. She spent 15 minutes with the patient while wearing a surgical mask and gloves. When the patient disclosed symptoms concerning for mpox, the HCW left the examination room and donned PPE before swabbing the patient's lesions. Samples from patient A tested positive for MPXV. The HCW saw patient B 4 days before her symptom onset. She spent 5 minutes with the patient while wearing a surgical mask and gloves. When the patient disclosed mpox symptoms, the HCW left the room and donned PPE before swabbing the patient's lesions. Samples from patient B tested positive for MPXV.

Of 159 other patients seen by the HCW during the 21 days before her symptom onset, only 3 had been tested for MPXV per database cross-reference, of which 2 tested negative. The patient that tested positive had been seen by the HCW 4 days before the HCW's symptom onset, and all lesions had healed by the visit date. Outside the workplace, an investigation of the HCW's contacts identified 1 high-risk (household) contact, 1 intermediate-risk contact, and 1 low-risk contact. High-risk and intermediate-risk contacts were offered postexposure prophylaxis.

A site visit to the outpatient visit indicated that it has 6 examination rooms, including 1 isolation room. No sharps injuries were documented while the HCW was at the clinic. The examination room is sanitized after each patient encounter. The main disinfecting products used are CaviCide disinfectant cleaner wipes and spray (Clorox; EPA List Q, contact time 3 min). Patients and staff share 2 gender-neutral bathrooms, which along with common areas are cleaned by building maintenance staff in the evenings. We notified 17 patients and 23 clinic staff with low-risk exposure to the HCW via calls and letters. Of the 23 staff members, 5 received postexposure prophylaxis.

Limitations to this report include a lack of acquiring phylogenetic match with contacts, no swabbing of surfaces in the clinic bathrooms or patient rooms, and no identification of secondary cases. In a previous report of occupationally acquired MPXV by HCWs in Brazil, transmission might have occurred via fomites or surface contamination during specimen collection in the patient's home. For the HCW reported here, MPXV infection could have been acquired through inadvertent contamination during specimen collection, contact with contaminated environmental surfaces in the examination room or bathroom, or unrecognized skin contamination during glove doffing.

In Los Angeles County, HCWs who care for patients with suspected or confirmed orthopoxvirus infections, including clinicians and environmental services personnel, are now eligible for vaccination against MPXV. CDC provides guidance for specimen collection and proper PPE. In 1 study, only 23% of exposed HCWs wore all recommended PPE; but despite low adherence, no HCW had mpox develop during the 21-day incubation period. Although the risk to HCWs in the United States continues to be very low, it is crucial to continue public health outreach, infection prevention, and training of HCWs to prevent MPXV transmission in healthcare settings, especially during specimen collection.

Dr Alarcón is an epidemic intelligence service officer with CDC, assigned to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. She is a family medicine physician working to protect and improve the health of vulnerable populations.

[With the shortage of HCWs globally and the potential for mpox patients to not disclose symptoms and/or not realize they may have the virus, should vaccination of HCWs be required, or at least highly encouraged? PPE fatigue and complacency become very real concerns, even among the most highly trained and knowledgeable staff simply due to the extended period of time PPE has been part of the daily routine. - Mod.JH]

[5] Experts debate mpox as a sexually transmitted infection
Date: Thu 22 Dec 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/mpox/experts-debate-mpox-status-sexually-transmitted-infection


Today, in [the journal] Clinical Infectious Diseases, two opposing commentaries debate whether or not mpox should be considered a sexually transmitted infection (STI). While the 2022 global outbreak has largely been defined by sexual transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM), the disease has historically been defined via household contact or animal-to-human contact via the ingestion of bushmeat.

Three requirements fulfilled
----------------------------
In the first article [https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac960/6955853], physicians from Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston and from California use epidemiologic factors to demonstrate causality. They suggest that, because the virus can be isolated from sexual fluids and because of the temporal association between sexual activity and subsequent infection, mpox should be considered an STI.

"The association between mpox and sexual transmission thus far fulfills 3 important requisites: strong association, consistency across time and geographic location, and temporality," they write.

The authors said this definition should certainly be adopted in Europe and North America, but sexual transmission is not the dominant transmission mode in Africa, so designating the virus as an STI in that region may be unhelpful.

Need for historical context
---------------------------
The second commentary [https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac962/6955869] says that labeling mpox as an STI ignores the historical impact of the disease in Central and West Africa. "The majority of historical outbreaks have been localized with little to no sexual transmission noted, significantly differing from what is seen currently," the authors write.

By labeling the virus an STI, less attention could be given to pediatric cases or tracking the disease in other vulnerable groups who are more commonly affected in Africa, add the authors, of Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis.

In September [2022], CIDRAP published a commentary by H Hunter Handsfield [https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/commentary-no-question-monkeypox-sti], stating that mpox is certainly an STI, as sexual activity has been implicated in 95% of US cases, and MSM [men who have sex with men] must be properly educated on the risks of contracting the virus.

[This seems like a case where 2 things can be true at once in that in certain populations mpox spreads like an STI while in other settings, especially Africa, that isn't necessarily the case and mpox transmission is tied to either close contact or animal contact/bushmeat ingestion. While it is important to understand how and why it spread so rapidly in the US, it is equally, if not more important, to understand the mechanisms of spread in Africa so that interventions can be implemented to reduce spillover events. - Mod.JH]
