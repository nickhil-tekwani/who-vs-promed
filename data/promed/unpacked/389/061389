According to the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, 2285 measles cases -- 1121 adults and 1164 children -- were reported the week ending 11 May 2019.

This brings the number of cases to 47 383 since the beginning of the year [2019], including 16 deaths.

During the week, Kharkiv, Ternopil, Khmelnytsky, Kiev, and Kyiv reported the most cases.

Since mid-2017, Ukraine reported more than 100 000 measles cases, 37 of whom died.

Worldwide, more than 20 million people are infected each year. Measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable death among children in the world.

There have been 58 reports of measles recorded so far this year [2019], according to the HSE's [Health Service Executive] Health Protection Surveillance Centre [HPSC].

Another 2 cases were reported to the HPSC in the past week -- one from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the other from the Southern Health Board. The 2 people affected were both female and aged between 15 and 34 years.

The HSE's assistant national director of health protection, Dr Keven Kelleher, has warned that cases of measles are set to rise over the summer [2019].

There has been an increase in measles, an acute viral disease, throughout the world and cases are spreading because people are travelling more.

Dr Kelleher said measles is very active throughout southern Europe.

Current vaccination rates are not good enough currently, with take-up rates up to 8% below what they should in some parts of the country.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) said today (17 May 20-19) that no additional case of measles infection had been recorded as at 4pm today and announced that the outbreak of measles infection at Hong Kong International Airport earlier has concluded.

A spokesman for the CHP said, "A total of 73 cases of measles infection were recorded so far this year [2019], among them 29 cases were associated with the outbreak among airport workers.

Regarding measles control measures implemented at the airport, a total of 23 persons had received measles vaccination at the airport vaccination station as at 6pm today [17 May 2019], bringing the cumulative number of vaccinations given to 8501 since 22 Mar 2019. The airport vaccination station will cease operation from [18 May 2019].

As for the blood test service, the DH earlier provided the measles serology test service to airport staff. A cumulative total of 777 blood samples have been collected. For the pilot service to provide measles serology testing for Filipino foreign domestic helpers working in Hong Kong, a total of 146 blood samples have been collected to date. Participants are notified individually of the serology results.

[4] India (Kerala): state witnesses surge in measles cases
Date: Mon 20 May 2019 08:47 IST
Source: The Hindu [abridged, edited]
https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-witnesses-surge-in-measles-cases/ article27182594.ece


The current global resurgence in measles is having its resonance in Kerala too, which has been witnessing a serious surge in the disease since January [2019].

Across the globe, huge local outbreaks have been caused by travel as well as the increase in unvaccinated populations.

In Kerala, however, the majority of the cases are reported from Thiruvananthapuram, which has good vaccination coverage and amongst people who are well-nourished and have received at least one dose of vaccine in their lifetime.

Kerala reports around 600 plus cases of measles every year. This year [2019], as many cases have been reported in the first 4 months itself, with over 50% cases in the 19-40 year age group. There are also cases in the less than 9 months age group, but fewer cases than before in the 1-5 years group.

Immunisation
------------
"When universal routine immunisation in childhood improves and the virus is still in circulation, the disease will naturally move to the older age group who may be unimmunised or whose vaccine-derived immunity has begun to wane. At a time when the state is moving towards measles elimination, adult measles is a major concern," a senior health official said.

Historically, measles has been a childhood disease. The epidemiological shift to older population presents new public health challenges because of the increased severity of the disease, especially in vulnerable populations like pregnant women and immunocompromised patients (HIV, organ transplant recipients on immunosuppressants, cancer patients), who cannot be vaccinated with the live attenuated measles vaccine.

"Earlier, nearly 90% of measles cases could be managed on out-patient basis. This year [2019], most cases are in the 19-35 age group and over 60% of the cases had to be admitted as in-patients, with a good percentage requiring ICU management," said R Aravind, head of infectious diseases at Thiruvananthapuram Medical College.

The changing epidemiology of measles has not just brought forth the several unknowns but also raised important questions on whether adult immunisation should be a policy, on vaccine potency and the adequacy of vaccine immune response.

Though measles vaccine is highly immunogenic, as part of the national measles elimination strategy, a mandatory 2nd dose at 15-18 months was introduced in 2010, so that there is better immune protection. It is fairly certain that those currently in the 18-40 years age group have not had the protection of the 2nd dose and may be one reason for the increase in cases in this age group.

The 1st vaccination age for measles has been fixed at 9 months because till then, the maternal antibodies transferred in utero are supposed to afford protection to the child. If vaccinated earlier, the maternal antibodies might interfere with the immune response to vaccine.

Susceptible
-----------
However, at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, the director, M Radhakrishna Pillai and team, who are currently studying the efficacy of measles vaccination in South India, have reported that children under the recommended vaccination age of 9 months are highly susceptible to measles.

SAT Hospital too has recently reported the death of an infant younger than 9 months due to measles.

"If the young mothers of the day do not have sufficient antibody protection, how do we protect infants younger than 9 months against measles? Given measles' age shift to older age group, should we move the vaccination age to 12 months for better vaccine response?

"Is a 3rd dose of MMR (mumps-measles-rubella) necessary? And should we recommend that all adults be given a dose of MMR as the virus is still in circulation? These questions need to be looked at from a research perspective by the State/National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation," a public health expert said.

[6] Ethiopia: cases
Date: Sun 19 May 2019

https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/ethiopian-children-remain-risk-measles-virus


The eastern African country of Ethiopia has been reporting measles outbreaks for many years, however, in 2019, new information indicates children are the ones most vulnerable for this infectious disease.

According to reporting by the European Commission, approximately 54% of the 4000 measles cases in Ethiopia reported during 2019 affected children under 5 years of age.

Moreover, over 60% of the children had never received their 1st measles vaccine dose.

This new data estimates that by the end of 2019, about 3.5 million children will be susceptible to the measles virus, mainly because of the failure to achieve the 'herd-immunity' necessary to interrupt transmission.

Moreover, these Ethiopian children are not the only under-vaccinated population.

An estimated 169 million children missed out on the 1st dose of the measles vaccine between 2010 and 2017, or 21.1 million children a year on average, said UNICEF on 25 Apr 2019.

And, the measles virus is one of the leading causes of death among children, particularly in developing countries. An estimated 100 000 measles deaths occurred globally in 2017.

Ethiopia announced it would aggressively confront this under-vaccination issue by integrating the measles vaccine 2nd dose (MCV2) vaccination into the routine immunization program in the 2nd year of life.

The Ethiopian Ministry of Health said about 3 348 363 children will receive measles vaccine 2nd doses.

Dr Chatora Rufaro, World Health Organization (WHO) Ethiopia representative said in a press release, "The introduction of the 2nd dose of measles vaccination in Ethiopia will significantly contribute to a reduction of measles morbidity and mortality as well as the overall child mortality by preventing measles outbreaks."

To notify visitors about Ethiopia's ongoing measles risks, the CDC issued an initial Level 1 Travel Alert in 2015. Since then, the CDC advises all visitors to Ethiopia to ensure they are immunized against the measles virus.

[7] New Hampshire (Keene, Cheshire county): alert from NH DHHS
Date: Sun 19 May 2019

https://manchesterinklink.com/measles-case-in-keene-prompts-warning-from-nh-dhhs/


The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Division of Public Health Services (DPHS) has identified a New Hampshire resident diagnosed with measles. The infection occurred in a child, and the source of the infection is still under investigation. The child was in the public places [see source URL above] during their infectious period when they could have transmitted the infection to people who are not immune to measles (that is, those not previously infected or who have not had age-appropriate MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccination).

CDC reports 41 new measles cases as US outbreak continues to grow
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The number of measles cases nationwide continues to rise, but not as dramatically as it has in recent weeks.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports there have been 880 measles cases since the beginning of the year [2019].

Oklahoma has joined the list of 24 states with measles cases. New York has been impacted the most, with more than 700 cases.

Some states, such as Connecticut and Maine, are working to limit reasons parents can cite for not vaccinating their children. And 2 weeks ago, Washington's governor signed a law that says parents with children going to daycare or school will no longer be able to claim personal or philosophical objections to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

Lawmakers in Oregon were considering similar legislation, but a bill was killed in the Senate to make way for a tax on large businesses in that state.

[9] Commentary by pediatrician Marilyn Heins: measles epidemic revisited
Date: Fri 19 May 2019
Source: Post Bulletin, Arizona Daily Star report [abridged, edited]
https://www.postbulletin.com/life/health/marilyn-heins-measles-epidemic-revisited/article_02da57cd-2d42-52a3-b937-7b04aafdbbfe.html


Let's briefly look back at the history of measles in the United States. In 1954 a medical article described measles as "inevitable as death and taxes." The 1st measles vaccine was developed in the US and made available in 1963, thankfully just in time for my own children to be immunized. After the vaccine was introduced, reported numbers of cases fell dramatically and after the vaccine was improved and the 2nd dose added to the immunization regimen, measles was eliminated from the US in 2000. But it's back!

The number of confirmed measles cases in the US is now the highest since measles was eliminated 19 years ago. There have been reported cases in [24 --see above] states, including Arizona, nearly half of America. Measles cases are up over 300% globally.

How can it be that 764 of us have been infected with the virus of this preventable disease? How could this happen in the very country that created the vaccine estimated to have averted millions of measles deaths worldwide?

1. The virus still exists in many parts of the world. The incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) can be as long as 14 days while an international flight from a country where measles is endemic can be much less than 14 hours.
2. The virus is very contagious: one sneeze can spread it. You can get measles by just being in a room up to 2 hours after an infected person had been there. 90% of unvaccinated exposed people will develop measles.
3. Doctors today may never have seen measles. The early symptoms can look like a respiratory infection, so measles may not be recognized until a child has infected many others.
4. The anti-vaccination movement has weakened our "herd immunity." When all or almost all people in an area are immunized, this can prevent an outbreak. It also protects those not old enough to get a measles shot and those whose immune systems are compromised by illness so they lack protective antibodies.

The anti-vaxx movement is getting stronger. A recent New York Times quote called the movement "an insidious misinformation campaign based on junk science and unfounded fears." The misinformation has led to unvaccinated children in our midst who go to our schools, playgrounds, malls, ice cream stores, theme parks.
