Leptospirosis in German tourists ex Dominican Republic
-------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Martin Grobusch (Charite, Berlin) has mailed following message which
may be of interest to you:
During the last couple of months, 3 patients with leptospirosis have been
diagnosed and treated at the Department of Infectious Diseases (Head: Prof.
N. Suttorp), Charite, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.
Patient 1: In December 2000, a 60 year-old male German presented with an
acute onset of fever, chills, cephalgias and myalgias 3 days after return
from a 3-week holiday in a tourist resort near Puerto Plata. In the course
of disease he developed mild hepatic, renal, and pulmonary involvement.
Blood cultures remained sterile, but leptospirosis serology before
discharge was positive (ELISA-IgG 28.6 U/ml, normal <5) and malaria, dengue
fever, brucellosis, rickettsiosis, Hantavirus infection as well as other
possible diagnoses were excluded. Our patient recovered fully within days
after initiation of chemotherapy with co-amoxiclav [amoxicillin-clavulanic
acid. Particular risk factors for exposure to leptospirosis were not
identified.
Patient 2: In April 2001, a 25 year-old woman from the Dominican Republic
but living in Germany returned from a 3-week visit of relatives and friends
back home. 9 days after her return to Berlin she came down with severe
arthralgias, myalgias, febrile (continuously greater than 39 degrees
centigrade) and, initially, watery diarrhea. Her condition deteriorated and
she developed pericardial effusion, hepatic involvement and rhabdomyolysis
with subsequent acute renal failure. Blood cultures remained sterile, but
leptospirosis serology (ELISA-IgM 34.5 U/l, normal <15) turned positive
within days, and other potential single or additional causes of disease
including malaria, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, brucellosis and others
were excluded. She recovered slowly after initiation of chemotherapy with
co-amoxiclav and symptomatic treatment in our ICU. Specific risk factors
were unidentifiable.
Patient 3: In May 2001, a 39 year-old German woman presented one day after
her return from a 3-week holiday in a resort near Santo Domingo with an
acute onset of high fever (continuously greater than 39 degrees
centigrade), chills, cephalgias, myalgias, diffuse abdominal pain, a tender
left kidney region and an initial bout of watery diarrhea. During the
following days, she developed a subileus and mild renal involvement. Blood
cultures remained sterile, but leptospirosis serology (ELISA-IgM 41.0 U/l,
normal <15) turned positive after one week. Malaria, dengue fever,
rickettsiosis and other possible diseases were excluded. She recovered
within days after initiation of chemotherapy with co-amoxiclav. Again,
specific risk factors were not identified.
Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonosis that is endemic in most temperate
and tropical countries. Human infection occurs through exposure to water
and soil contaminated by infected animal urine. It has been associated with
canoeing, wading and swimming in contaminated lakes and rivers. In our
patients, we were unable to identify particular risk factors.
