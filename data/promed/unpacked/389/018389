New bacteria main cause of blackleg in Dutch seed potatoes
----------------------------------------------------------
Test results have confirmed a major shift in the bacterial species causing blackleg in Dutch seed potatoes, with a new species being found in two-thirds of seed crops investigated. This seed-borne disease is the focus of inspections of seed crops, some of which are exported to countries such as the UK.

Back in 2014, researchers reported the first case of blackleg being caused by _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp _brasiliensis_ [Pcb] in the Netherlands [see link below]. Of all bacterial diseased plants the Dutch General Inspection Service (NAK) for seed investigated in 2015, 67 per cent were found to have this strain.

Before 2014, _Dickeya_ species dominated, but last year [2015], they were found in 21 per cent of the diseased plants. The species _Pectobacterium atrosepticum_ and _Pectobacterium wasabiae_ were each found in about 6 per cent.

In addition to the shifting species, NAK says 2015 saw an increase in the area downgraded because of blackleg to 15 per cent of seed potato fields, the highest percentage in 4 years.

[Blackleg of potato can be caused by several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_. Symptoms of blackleg on potato may include stem rot leading to leaf yellowing, wilting and stunting of plants, as well as tuber rot, which usually starts at the stem end of the tuber.

The bacteria are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including seed tubers), by mechanical means and water. Disease management may include seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting material and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and certification schemes are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

_Pectobacterium_ and _Dickeya_ species or subspecies also cause bacterial soft rot of potato. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing, for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.

_P. atrosepticum_ (previously _Erwinia carotovora_ subsp. _atroseptica_) was considered to be the main blackleg pathogen in Europe, until the emergence of the more virulent new species _Dickeya solani_ (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162). _P. wasabiae_ and _D. dianthicola_ are also known to cause the disease in Europe. _P. carotovorum_ subsp. _brasiliensis_ (Pcb) has been reported as a causal agent from a number of countries in the Americas, Africa and the Middle East, as well as Japan, New Zealand and Germany.

While Pcb was reported for the first time from the Netherlands in 2014, it has been suggested that it may have been present there for many years as part of the blackleg/soft rot disease complex, before being identified due to improved methodologies. It was estimated that in 2012 it would have been responsible for approximately 10 per cent of blackleg incidence in that country. The increase reported above over just 3 years is drastic, and the high incidence in the seed crop poses a serious risk to future national potato yields and export trade.

Population shifts of plant pathogens are being observed with increasing frequency. Recent examples in Europe are the distribution of potato late blight strains (ProMED-mail post 20150317.3237610) and apple black rot (ProMED-mail post 20090914.3230). Climate changes and selection pressure due to intensified agriculture are thought to be among the possible reasons.
