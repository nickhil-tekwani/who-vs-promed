According to WHO (Zimbabwe) Harare hardest hit by measles outbreak
------------------------------------------------------------------
Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, has been hardest hit by a measles outbreak that
has so far claimed more than 40 lives countrywide since late 2009 and
accounts for 32 per cent of all reported cases, according to data jointly
released by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO)
on Tuesday [19 Jan 2010]. Harare had by 10 Jan 2010 recorded an
accumulative 52 confirmed cases of the disease, which normally affects
children and whose complications may lead to blindness, meningitis, or
death. At least 22 of Harare's cases were reported between 4 Jan 10 Jan
2010, raising fears that the outbreak may be worsening in the capital.

A total of 158 suspected cases have been reported in the capital since the
outbreak started in November 2009. Makoni district in Manicaland and the
Midlands' Zvishavane closely follow behind Harare, with 15 confirmed cases
each -- although the former leads in the suspected cases tally where nearly
500 reports have been investigated. Makoni also leads in terms of the
nationwide deaths recorded since the onset of the outbreak, recording 24
fatalities over the past 2 months. Mutare, also in Manicaland, has the 2nd
highest deaths, recording 15 casualties [deaths] over the same period.

An estimated 1052 suspected cases have been reported countrywide although
confirmed cases number only 161. At least 41 people have died from the
disease, according to WHO and the Ministry of Health. This is a huge leap
from the 340 suspected cases reported by WHO in Dec 2009. The head of WHO
in Zimbabwe, Custodia Mandlhate, told journalists at the time that the
hardest hit areas included the districts of [Bubi in Matabeleland North
province; Murambinda, Makoni, and Chipinge in Manicaland province;
Chirumanzu and Zvishavane in Midlands province; and Marondera in
Mashonaland East province].

Most of the cases were among members of religious groups that shun
conventional medical treatment as a matter of adherence to their faiths.
Health officials in some of the measles-affected areas have been forced to
enlist the assistance of the police to force members of an apostolic sect
to immunise their children.

[This outbreak of measles in Zimbabwe continues to escalate, so far mainly
affecting the capital Harare, and the east of the country. The number of
fatalities has almost doubled from 22 on 29 Dec 2009 to at least 41
currently, and the number of suspected cases countrywide has increased from
340 to 1052 during the same period. The spread of the infection is being
attributed to the number of people in the population who have decline
measles vaccination on religious grounds, some of whom are now being
subjected to forcible vaccination by the Zimbabwean police force.

The outbreak may be being fueled by a general decline in vaccine coverage
associated with the economic state of Zimbabwe.
