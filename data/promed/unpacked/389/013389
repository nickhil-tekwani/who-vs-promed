The number of Aucklanders suspected of contracting whooping cough continues to rise with 27 new cases reported in the past week. As of last Fri 25 May 2012, there were 274 confirmed or probable cases of the infection, according to Auckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS], up from 247 on 16 May 2012.

"The outbreak is continuing. It's been with us since the beginning of 2012 and the number of cases is increasing every day," said Dr William Rainger, medical officer of health at the ARPHS. "Our response has been to actively follow up on cases to prevent the spread and to protect those most vulnerable."

Rainger confirmed the newly notified cases are not linked to a Middlemore Hospital midwife who may have infected up to 170 people [the work 'may' here suggests that up to 170 people were exposed, rather than infected - Mod.LL]. The midwife who contracted the disease was immediately sent home to recover and may have been vaccinated. "It is a sporadic outbreak, which means that it is being spread through the community," he said.

Rainger said the ARPHS was gathering information on the areas in Auckland where the outbreak was continuing. "Our response has been to actively follow up on cases to prevent the spread and to protect those vulnerable."

[The diagnosis of pertussis in a midwife could be a major issue since the neonates that the health care deliverer exposed are the exact group with the highest risk of morbidity and mortality from human infection with _Bordetella pertussis_. Ideally, the neonates should be immune since women in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy can be safely vaccinated with the vaccine, giving birth to babies who are protected by transplacentally acquired antibody. Certainly all healthcare workers, especially those with contact with infants less than a year of age, should receive a pertussis vaccine in the form of dTap to further "cocoon" the susceptible infants. - Mod.LL
