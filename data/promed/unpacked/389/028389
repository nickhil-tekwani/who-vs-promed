New Mexico health officials have reported a case of human tularemia in a 51-year-old man from Los Alamos County. The man was hospitalized but has recovered and gone home. There have also been 33 cases of tularemia in 2015 in pet dogs and cats from Bernalillo, Los Alamos, Santa Fe, Taos, and Torrance Counties. This is the 1st human tularemia case seen in New Mexico in 2015. In 2014 there were 5 human cases of tularemia recorded in the state.

"Tularemia can cause serious illness in both people and pets. I encourage people around the state to follow the same precautions they would to avoid contracting plague, which includes not handling sick or dead animals," said Department of Health Cabinet Secretary, Retta Ward, MPH. "People can get tularemia if they handle infected animals such as rabbits or rodents or if they are bitten by infected ticks or deer flies."

Tularemia is a potentially serious illness in people that occurs in many parts of the USA. It is caused by a bacterium found in animals, especially rodents, rabbits and hares. Tularemia can also make dogs and cats sick and they can give the disease to people. Other possible, but less likely, exposures are through contact with infected soil or water or by inhaling the bacterium.

"Many areas of the state have seen a large increase in the rabbit population in and a lot of them have been getting sick and dying from tularemia," said Dr Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. "Oftentimes when there is a rabbit or rodent die off in an area due to tularemia, deer flies or ticks can become infected from these animals and then pass it on to pets or people when they bite them."

[The CDC discussion on how a diagnosis of tularemia is made (http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/clinicians/index.html):
Physicians who suspect tularemia should promptly collect appropriate specimens (see below) and alert the laboratory to the need for special diagnostic and safety procedures. Rapid diagnostic testing for tularemia is not widely available.

Growth of _Francisella tularensis_ in culture is the definitive means of confirming the diagnosis of tularemia. Appropriate specimens include swabs or scrapping of skin lesions, lymph node aspirates or biopsies, pharyngeal washings, sputum specimens, or gastric aspirates, depending on the form of illness. Paradoxically, blood cultures are often negative.

A presumptive diagnosis of tularemia may be made through testing of specimens using direct fluorescent antibody, immunohistochemical staining, or PCR.

The diagnosis of tularemia can also be established serologically by demonstrating a 4-fold change in specific antibody titers between acute and convalescent sera. Convalescent sera are best drawn at least 4 weeks after illness onset; hence this method is not useful for clinical management. - Mod.LL
