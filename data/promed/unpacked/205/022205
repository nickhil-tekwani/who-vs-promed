A drugs programme which slashed malaria infections in parts of Cambodia is
being extended to an African island, with Chinese scientists aiming to
simultaneously treat all 40 000 residents, an expert said.
Although malaria-infected mosquitoes pass the parasite from person to
person, the scientists say the real source of the disease is people, some
of whom can carry it in their bodies for a long time without showing clear
symptoms.
Moheli Island, the test location, is among the Comoros group of islands at
the northern mouth of the Mozambique Channel, about 2/3 of the way between
northern Madagascar and northern Mozambique.
While the average carrier rate in the 10 most seriously affected villages
on Moheli is 50 per cent, the rate is as high as 94.4 per cent in some
villages and as low as 6.5 per cent in other areas. Malaria is the most
common cause of death for children under the age of 5.
"This project is to eradicate the parasite in humans because the real
source is the humans," said Li Guoqiang, a professor at the Tropical
Medicine Institute at Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine
(GUTCM) in southern China. "When it is driven out of humans, mosquitoes
will not carry it since mosquitoes get it from humans. And once the
parasite is not around, malaria will be exterminated."
Li disclosed the plan at an anti-malaria conference in Guangzhou and told
Reuters later that GUTCM and the Comoros were expected to sign an agreement
soon. The project would probably kick off in the first half of 2007. Under
the plan, the islanders will be prescribed a single dose of
arteminisin-based combination therapy (ACTs) and primaquine, which they
will all consume at the same time to clear the parasite from their bodies.
The World Health Organization recommends ACTs as the drug of choice against
malaria. Artemisinin is a compound extracted from an herb mostly grown in
China. Primaquine, another anti-malaria drug, blocks transmission of the
parasite after 24 hours.
But some experts were cautious about the plan, saying frequent use of
primaquine may bring drug resistance, something the world can ill afford
given what is already a limited arsenal against malaria, which kills more
than 1 million people a year.
Drugs to cut parasite pool
--------------------------
Li expects the total pool of malaria parasites in the islanders to drop
sharply after the mass administration of drugs.
But because infected mosquitoes -- which have a 30-day life span -- may
still be lurking and transmit the disease, a 2nd round of mass drug intake
will be carried out 40 days later. "That would bring the (malaria parasite)
carrier rate down by at least 99 per cent," Li said.
The plan also involves everyone taking primaquine every 10 days for the
first 6 months. Li and colleagues implemented similar schemes in 2 places
in Cambodia in recent years and the results were impressive.
Malaria infections fell by 90 per cent in one district and, in the other,
only 2 to 3 per cent of villagers tested positive for the parasite on the
40th day. Prior to that 57 per cent of villagers carried the parasite. "The
projects have been going fine. Infection rates have plunged sharply and
people have had no adverse side effects," said Duong Socheat, the director
of the National Malaria Centre in Cambodia who oversaw the 2 projects there.
While some experts said a malaria-free environment would be near impossible
to maintain as outsiders could bring in the parasite, Li insisted a more
creative solution to malaria was needed. "The traditional method is to kill
the mosquitoes, but we have been doing that for 50 years and it doesn't
work," he said.

[In the 19th century there were apparently no anopheline vectors on the
island, but these were somehow introduced, presumably by ships, in the
early 20th century. Presently 6 _Anopheles_ species are recorded from
Moheli, including _Anopheles gambiae_ s.s. (one of the world's most
efficient malaria vectors) and another important African vector, _An.
funestus_, which appears to be the most common malaria vector on the
island. _Anopheles merus_, an East African salt-water species capable of
malaria transmission, has been found on the island breeding in crab-holes,
but is not considered to be epidemiologically important.
_Anopheles gambiae_ typically breeds in exposed sunlit and often transient
aquatic habitats such as pools, puddles, and irrigation channels, while
_An. funestus_ breeds in more permanent shaded waters often with aquatic
vegetation. Adults of both species bite people in and outside houses and
afterwards rest mainly in houses.
I am intrigued by the sweeping statement by Professor Li Guoqiang that
infected mosquitoes have a 30-day lifespan, it is generally regarded that
the mean longevity of adult female anopheline vectors is about 10-14 days,
and occasionally 3 weeks.
Finally, I would have thought that if the human reservoir of malaria were
eradicated, malaria transmission would recur if infected people came to the
island, because the mosquito vectors will still be there. So, as both _An.
gambiae_ and _An. funestus_ commonly rest in houses, insecticidal residual
house spraying, possibly with DDT, would be beneficial in reducing the
likelihood of renewed transmission. - Mod.MS
The developmental cycle of _P. falciparum_ in the mosquito takes 8 to 12
days, which mean that without simultaneous mosquito control, people will be
reinfected by new mosquito bites at times when they have no drug left in
their blood after a single dose of artemisinin and primaquine. It is
furthermore unlikely that a treatment programme can reach all 40 000
inhabitants at the same time; again, without vector control, a few
gametocyte carriers will be able to sustain the infection. Because the
population has clinical immunity to malaria, surveillance based on
reporting of clinical cases will not be possible.
A further problem is travellers from neighbouring islands, who will have
clinical immunity and thus many of whom will be asymptomatic gametocyte
carriers. This will continuously introduce new infections to the island.
The WHO performed an interesting study in 1971, the Garki project, in
Nigeria, trying to control malaria by continuous chemoprophylaxis and
residual spraying against mosquitoes. Parasite rates were brought down from
over 50 per cent to below 0.2 per cent, but returned to pre-project levels
within 3 years when the project was terminated. ProMED will be interested
to receive further data on the progress of the project. - Mod.EP
From <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comoros>: "The Comoros is an island
nation in the Indian Ocean, located off the eastern coast of Africa on the
northern end of the Mozambique Channel between northern Madagascar and
northeastern Mozambique. The nearest countries to the Comoros are
Mozambique, Tanzania, Madagascar, and the Seychelles." - CopyEd.PG]
