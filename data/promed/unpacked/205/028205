A sudden outbreak of acute necrotizing encephalitis (ANE) has been reported from a medical college in Kanpur. Over 30 medical students have been down with high-grade fever. The rare disease has affected students of GSVM medical college. Among them, 7 had tested positive for the infection.

As per the medical college spokesman Dr. Ganesh Shankar, the spread of the disease on the campus might have been due to the pigs and the unhygienic conditions they caused.

According to the official sources, the first case was reported earlier this week when a third-year student from Barabanki was brought to LLR hospital's ICU with a high fever and severe headache. The student was confirmed to be suffering from the disease on Tuesday. Reportedly, the student has slipped into a coma and is currently on life support. Vice principal of the college Dr Richa Giri informed that the girl's medical tests suggested she was infected with ANE which had spread to her brain. Following her going into a coma, her parents have been informed.

As per a senior doctor, 5 medical students infected with ANE have been admitted to a special maternity ward, and 2 among them are on a ventilator. On Wednesday [28 Sep 2022], following the examination of students in the boys' and girls' hostel, doctors found 6 more students showing similar symptoms. Among them, 3 were in their 3rd year and one was in their final year. Of the students, 5 have been rushed to the maternity ward and one has been admitted to the ICU, sources told.

The sudden outbreak of illness has gripped the college with fear. Around 20 pigs have been found dead around the campus within just 4 days, sources informed. A tour taken by a doctors' team found 16 more dead pigs around the campus. All of them have been buried on campus.

As per Dr Alok Varma, a neurologist serving the college, ANE is a rare disease. The MRI scan of the students showed blood clotting and swelling in the brain. Medical examination also found some unknown viruses in their bodies.

[It is difficult to speculate on what the etiology of these cases is. The occurrence of this many cases in an apparent short period of time points to a common source of exposure. The occurrence of many dead pigs in the area may or may not be related to the human cases. Nipah virus infects both people and pigs, but this would be an unusual outbreak of this virus. There is no indication of what these unknown viruses are that were discovered in the bodies of these cases. There is the possibility that a toxicant is involved in these human and porcine cases. Laboratory testing is needed to determine the cause. ProMED would be very interested in the results of any laboratory tests that are done. - Mod.TY
