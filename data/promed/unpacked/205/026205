BAI finds "harmless" bird-flu virus in Calumpit area
-----------------------------------------------
The Bureau of Animal Industry [BAI] announced Friday [8 Jul 2005] the
detection of a low-risk flu strain in ducks in Calumpit, Bulacan, but said
there is no cause for alarm, since the strain is not fatal to humans and
animals.
Bulacan agriculture officials were quick to downplay the detection of
bird-flu virus in a backyard duck farm in Calumpit, saying it was a
low-risk flu strain.
In a joint press statement by the Department of Agriculture and the
Department of Health, officials assured the people that the flu strain
poses no risk to humans and other animals.
"There is no cause for panic, since this type of virus is not harmful. In
fact, we haven't recorded any mortality in poultry where the strain was
discovered. This is a low-risk virus type," Agriculture Secretary Arthur
Yap told reporters.
Samples containing the strain, which were detected by BAI during routine
testing, will be sent to the Office Internationale des Epizooties
[OIE]/Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] laboratory in Australia for
confirmation, he said.
Jose Molina, the BAI director, said more testing in Australia, using
sophisticated methods and equipment, will determine the specific strain
that infected ducks in Bulacan.
"This is the 1st detection of this kind of flu strain in the country, and
we are investigating the origin of this virus. Since it was discovered near
the swamp area in Bulacan, which is frequented by migratory birds, this
might be the source," he said.
The strain was identified as H5, a nonfatal strain that is found in other
countries such as the United States. The deadly strain that hit most of
Asia is the N1 flu virus type. [see commentary].
To prevent the spread of the flu strain, BAI said it has imposed a ban on
the sale and transport of poultry within a 3 km radius of the affected farm
for a week.
Molina said his office has intensified surveillance and testing of all
poultry farms in nearby areas. "But we don't want to create misinformation
among farmers raising poultry, because they might sell their animals to
other areas once they suspect that the government would be destroying their
flocks. This could jeopardize our campaign," Molina said.
He said the BAI is carefully monitoring 20 major critical areas in the
country and has poured around PHP 20 million [USD 335 600] to fund bird-flu
prevention and surveillance programs. The government is set to release an
additional PHP 50 million [USD 889 000] for the program, he said.
Meanwhile, Imelda Palabyab, president of the Philippine Association of
Broiler Integrators, said her group volunteered to temporarily suspend
poultry shipments to Japan until the country is cleared of the infection.
Government records showed the Philippines has shipped around 3000 tons of
chicken to Japan as of June this year [2005], or 500 tons a month. The
country is hoping to export 10 000 tons of chicken to Japan this year, a
small share of the 300 000 tons that make up the Japanese annual requirement.
"There is a possibility that the strain was carried to the area by
migratory birds," Dr. Hayashi Carillo said, noting the Candaba Swamp is
regularly visited by migratory birds from different parts of Southeast Asia.
Authorities in the neighboring province of Pampanga have also started
taking measures to prevent the entry of bird flu in the bird sanctuary at
the vast Candaba swamps. Mayor Jerry Pelayo of Candaba said he has
established checkpoints to stop the transportation of poultry into the town
as a precautionary measure.

[Defining the causal agent, an H5 avian influenza strain, as being an LPAI
(low pathogenic avian influenza) is premature at the present stage of the
investigation. The full typing (including the N type) and the pathogenicity
of the virus should be determined according to a prescribed protocol;
reportedly, these tests are expected to be performed, in this case, at the
reference laboratory in Australia, namely CSIRO, Australian Animal Health
Laboratory (AAHL), Geelong, Victoria, Australia. The other 6 reference
OIE/FAO labs for avian influenza are situated in Japan, Italy, the USA,
Germany (2 labs), and the UK. - Mod.AS]
