Three sheep died in Kattangoor mandal headquarters on Saturday [25 May 2019]. On receiving the information, animal husbandry officials rushed to spot and confirmed that the sheep died of anthrax disease.

District Animal Husbandry joint director Ch Ramesh told the Express that the department has sent 4 special teams to vaccinate livestock within a radius of 5 km from Kattangoor mandal headquarters. It would take 3 days for the vaccination, he said.

It also came to light that some people ate the meat of the dead sheep. The officials, however, said that there is no danger to them [!!! Oh? Normally one is at significant risk from eating such contaminated meat. - Mod.MHJ], however the officer warned the people to avoid eating sheep meat for few days to avoid any such incidents.

Anthrax is a rare but serious illness caused by a spore-forming bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_. Anthrax mainly affects livestock. Humans can also get infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals. According to the officials, there's no evidence that anthrax is transmitted from person to person, but it's possible that anthrax skin lesions may be contagious through direct contact. It has been noted that, usually, anthrax bacteria enter the body through a wound in the skin. One can also become infected by eating contaminated meat or inhaling the spores, added the officials.

[The ring-vaccination should be successful, and if there are other cases in these flocks, the vaccination team should hear of the unexpected death of any sheep or hospitalisation of human cases.
