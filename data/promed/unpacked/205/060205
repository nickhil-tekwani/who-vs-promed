Following an outbreak of pest and brown spot disease in their paddy fields recently, farmers in Mongar [district] are worried about the yield. Some leased landholders said they won't be able to return the landowner's share if the harvest is not good.

[The local] agriculture extension [office] said, the pest and disease outbreak has occurred due to climate change and farmers using old stock seeds. [They] had suggested affected farmers apply urea to retain the plants and had also distributed spray machines and pesticides. However, some farmers are reluctant to apply chemical fertilisers and pesticides.

A team from agriculture research and development center [of the Bhutan Ministry of Agriculture & Forests] in Wengkhar also visited and inspected the affected paddy fields.

[Brown spot disease of rice is caused by the fungus _Bipolaris oryzae_ (synonyms _Cochliobolus miyabeanus_, _Helminthosporium oryzae_). It occurs worldwide and was responsible for a famine in India ("Bengal famine") in the early 1940s. Symptoms include brownish spots on leaves and glumes, as well as blight on seedlings grown from infected seeds with a mortality rate of up to 60 per cent. The disease also affects quality, weight and number of grains per panicle with a reported yield reduction of up to 45 per cent. Leaf spots are thought to be due to a toxin produced by the fungus. Disease development is favoured by poor nutritional state of the host and high humidity leading to leaf wetness.

The fungus is seed transmitted and can survive on seeds for several years. Spread also occurs with wind and on infected plant debris. Volunteer rice and grassy weeds serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management may include fungicide sprays and seed treatments (hot water, fungicides), but mainly relies on the use of clean seed and resistant crop varieties.

In the story above, insect pests may contribute to a higher rate of mechanical spread of the fungus by carrying spores and/or providing entry points for the fungus through wounding of leaf surfaces.

Related species in the genus can affect other crops and cause, for example, target spot of sorghum (_B. sorghicola_), coconut leaf blight (_B. incurvata_) and eye spot of sugar cane (_B. sacchari_).
