Rapid test and comments
-----------------------
As the person who was head of the Pirbright Laboratory during the UK 2001
FMD epidemic I am very familiar with the claims made by Roger Breese and
Fred Brown for the rapid diagnostic method for FMD. However, as they were
unwilling to provide scientific data to support their claims no real spirit
of trust and collaboration was developed between us. ... Subsequently, much
time had to be spent by me and colleagues at Pirbright explaining to policy
makers and Defra that we were unable to verify the claims that were being
made for the rapid test.
By contrast, over 200 scientists, both veterinary and non-veterinary, from
other institutions in the UK, other European and antipodean countries came
to Pirbright and supported us at different stages during the epidemic.
Those friends and colleagues freely and unselfishly assisted us in the true
spirit of collaboration. They did sterling work and for their support I
will always have heartfelt gratitude. I am glad to record that during the
epidemic there was excellent collaboration in the area of molecular
virology between Peter Mason and his group at Plum Island and colleagues at
Pirbright.

Rapid test and comments
-----------------------
Various Science Advisory Council recommendations make it clear that the
development and use of diagnostic technologies is Defra's responsibility,
not IAH [Institute for Animal Health] Pirbright's, and that decisions on
policy priorities are the responsibility of the UK Government. Two UK DEFRA
documents have been brought to my attention:
Recommendation 13 in
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/documents/SAC-ED_04_%207RecomendationsFinalv2.pdf>
(2 September 2004) states: "Accurate pen side tests should be developed for
the diagnosis of FMD in cattle and pigs. The Department should develop the
capability to identify further research needs, including a review of
current technology and the identification of novel future technologies."
[Why sheep are not included is puzzling as they are the most difficult to
diagnose in the field. - Mod.MHJ]
and item 14 in
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/documents/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20SAC-ED%20_05_%204%20Outstanding%20issues.pdf>
(2 February 2005) says: "Defra should set out the timeframe for the
development and validation work on pen side tests and provide an estimateof
when these tests are likely to be available for deployment."
