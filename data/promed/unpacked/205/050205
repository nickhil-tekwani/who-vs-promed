I got the following addendum to my post on rotavirus vaccines:
"[Thanks to Jim Koopman for this information. As we it appears we are
getting far away from our limited area of expertise and cannot sustain such
a discussion here, we are cutting this very interesting and critical
string. - Mod.CHC"
I am disturbed that a major list-serve dealing with the control of
infectious diseases is unwilling to entertain discussions regarding theory
that is needed to understand, evaluate, and predict how different factors
will affect the circulation of infectious agents in populations. The
community that deals with the clinical, molecular and public health aspects
of infection should be using transmission system analysis as one of their
basic scientific tools. They should not be saying that discussions of
transmission system analyses are outside of their expertise. Rather they
should be taking the course I have put on the web and acquiring the
expertise that they need. They will find that this is not so difficult.

[Well, I didn't meant to step on Dr. Koopman's toes. We have lots to do
here and we did post the web site address for those who are interested. It
did not seem to me that a question was being asked or that data on an
emerging disease was forthcoming. I did not at all indicate that the
subject matter was uninteresting. Indeed, I checked out the web site and
printed out the text. It appears excellent and I recommend it highly. As
for whether I have read it all, I haven't. In spite of Dr. Koopman's
urging that we all take his course and that it is not difficult, I haven't
got the time right now. We had a grandchild born last night, I watched the
Notre Dame-Hawaii game, moderated a bunch of ProMED-mail messages,
completed a semi-annual report, reviewed two manuscripts and a grant
proposal, learned how to use Excel to make overheads, the neighbor's cat
vomited in our living room and I had to clean the carpet, went to the lab
(nothing to do there on a Saturday, it's just a habit), set up the
paperwork for an ELISA, paid some bills, sent in my application for an
international conference on emerging diseases, spoke with my sister in New
York, read "Peromyscus Newsletter", mailed some letters at the post office,
made potato salad, and put the finishing touches on the first drafts of two
manuscripts. Not everyone has time to read everything. However, whether I
have a full life or not, there is no reason that interested people cannot
go to Jim Koopman's excellent web site and take his course. I recommend
reading it, unless, of course, your neighbor has a cat. - Mod.CHC
