Seal virus found for the first time in Shetland
----------------------------------------------------------------
THE seal virus which has killed thousands of animals throughout the North
Sea this year has been found in Shetland for the first time, scientists
confirmed yesterday.
Two dead grey seals discovered on beaches in Shetland between two and three
weeks ago were found to contain PDV (phocine distemper virus) after
post-mortems were carried out by the veterinary science division of the
Scottish Agricultural College, in Inverness.
Bob Reid, head of the division's wildlife unit, said this was the first
time PDV had been found so far north. During the devastating outbreak 14
years ago, it was believed the virus never travelled north of Orkney.
As in 1988, when more than 20 000 seals died, this epidemic broke out in
the Kattegat, off Denmark, but far fewer animals have been killed this
year. [see comment].
After its initial appearance in June, PDV was first confirmed in Britain in
August, since when the disease has been implicated in more than 3000 deaths.
Whereas previously it was thought that only common or harbour seals were
vulnerable to PDV, Britain's other native seal species, grey seals, have
been found with the disease this year.
One theory is that the virus could have been brought into the North Sea by
foreign species, such as the Arctic harp seal.

[The Sea Mammals Research Unit in Aberdeen, reported in its 19th weekly
report for 2002 that between 11 Dec and 17 Dec there have been 47 dead
seals reported around the UK. Since the beginning of the outbreak in the
UK, reportedly on 13 Aug 2002, a total of 3682 dead seals have been
reported of which 2735 were in England, 709 in Scotland, 150 in Wales and
88 in Northern Ireland. Of these, 422 were determined as Common Seals, 623
as Grey Seals and 2637 remained indeterminates.
See <http://www.smru.st-and.ac.uk/pdv/statreport19.htm>.
The recent Phocine Distemper outbreak was initially identified in May 2002
in common seals in the Danish Kattegat area. Since then, the virus has
spread to the Swedish and Norwegian coast in the Kattegat/Skagerrak area,
to the east coast of the United Kingdom and also to the Dutch, German and
Danish Wadden Sea, where the virus was first found in a common seal
stranded on the Dutch Wadden Sea coast in mid June 2002. The occurrence of
the pdv infection was associated with an unusually high mortality in the
above areas. Between the beginning in May 2002 and the end of Oct 2002, in
total about 21 000 dead common seals (_Poca vitulina_) were registered in
the Danish-Swedish-Norwegian Kattegat/Skagerrak area, the Limfjord, the
Baltic Sea, the Wadden Sea and the North Sea. These figures, to which the
UK figures should be added, indicate that the 2002 outbreak seems to have
been even more devastating than the 1988 one - differing with the statement
in the above posting. Since the end of October, new cases of the disease
have been reported only from the UK.
The PD virus is very contagious for common seals, but not dangerous for
man. As stated in the Nov 2002 issue of the Wadden Sea Newsletter, most of
the 80 percent of the virus-infected seals died due to secondary infections
from other pathogens such as bacteria, because the virus weakens the immune
system. Most often the cause of death is pneumonia. See
