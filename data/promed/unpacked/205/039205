3 PEOPLE TEST POSITIVE FOR WEST NILE VIRUS
-----------------------------------------------
2 Individuals Are Hospitalized In Stable Condition, and One Individual Has
Been Released From The Hospital
4 New Mosquito Pools Also Test Positive for West Nile Virus
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today [12
Sep 2000 that 3 additional individuals have tested positive for West Nile
virus in New York City: a 77 year-old man from Florida who was staying in
Canarsie, Brooklyn, is hospitalized in stable, and improving condition; a
54 year-old man who is known to spend time in both Sunset Park, Brooklyn
and Cliffside Park, N.J. is hospitalized in stable, and improving,
condition; and a 40 year-old woman from Castleton Corners, Staten Island,
who has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home. The
laboratory results were obtained by tests performed at the New York City
Department of Health's laboratories, and specimens have been sent to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for further
confirmation. There is now a total of 11 people who have been diagnosed
with West Nile virus in New York City in 2000. Dr. Cohen made this
announcement at a news conference this evening with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The Florida resident who was staying in Brooklyn became ill on 27 Aug 2000,
was admitted to the hospital with encephalitis on 3 Sep 2000, and remains
hospitalized in stable, and improving, condition. The man who has been
known to spend time in Sunset Park, Brooklyn and Cliffside Park, N.J.
became ill on 31 Aug 2000, and was admitted to the hospital with
encephalitis on 4 Sep 2000. He remains hospitalized in stable, but
improving, condition. The Staten Island woman became ill on 2 Sep 2000, was
admitted to the hospital on 5 Sep 2000 and was released from the hospital
on 11 Sep 2000.
"We will continue our extensive public outreach activities to inform the
public about our spraying activities for West Nile virus, including
scheduled radio announcements on WCBS radio, the City's West Nile
Information Line, the Health Department's website, print media, and other
media outlets. In addition, our spraying activities are escorted by New
York City Police Department vehicles with loudspeakers to help make
individuals in the vicinity of scheduled spraying operations aware of
spraying activities that will take place in that area," Dr. Cohen concluded.
MOSQUITO FINDINGS
The positive West Nile findings announced today include the 4 mosquito
pools on Staten Island: 3 from Grasmere (one pool was collected on 8 Aug
2000, one pool was collected on 25 Aug 2000, and one pool was collected on
