[The following report is a response to a ProMED-mail post entitled
"Rabies, human, otter - USA (FL): Request for information
20070522.1636", which concerned what appeared to be a previously
unrecorded attack by a rabid otter on golfers at a course in Indian
County, Florida.
So far this year [2007], 10 people have been bitten by rabid animals
in Indian County, Florida: 3 by the otter in the incident described
below, and the others by raccoons and a stray cat. - Mod.CP]
[A rabid otter bit a female golfer at the 7th hole of Grand Harbor's
Harbor Course, on 7 May 2007, shortly after biting another woman
while she was walking her small dog.] Both were chased by the
unprovoked animal, which later bit a man at his home before being
caught and hauled off by county Animal Control. The otter tested
positive for rabies, causing all 3 bite victims to begin a series of
vaccine [injections] to prevent a disease that usually is fatal.
[The woman walking her dog] said the animal chased her at least 100
yards (approx 91 m), onto a neighbor's porch. No one answered the
door and the otter continued to attack until she winged it with a
doormat. "I was terrified," she said. "I had been bit and it just
kept coming. You have a creature that's crazy, chasing you. There's
very little you can do."
[The 1st victim] said Wednesday [23 May 2007], she has one more shot
to go in a series of vaccines to prevent her from getting the
disease. "There's a pond on that hole -- it's a short par 3," she
said. "(The otter) was on the grass. He or she was just staring at
me. "All of a sudden he charged me and bit my ankle," she said.
"There are 3 punctures." [Her] golf partner was some distance behind
her on the men's tee. "[He] caught up -- of course, he had a golf
club," she said. "He was swinging the club at the otter." The animal
chased them until they crossed a street. The couple then drove to
Indian River Medical Center, where [the other victim] already was
being treated. "He broke the skin in 12 different places," she said.
"The 4 big bites that I had all would have required stitches."
Instead, the wounds were left open to drain -- a common precaution
against infection with animal bites.
Both women said they thought Grand Harbor management should have
moved more quickly to notify residents about the otter attack. Some
e-mails reportedly were sent to River Club residents the following
morning [8 May 2007], and a flier left on doorsteps throughout the
community was dated 9 May 2007 -- the same day Becker said health
officials told her the otter had tested positive for rabies.
"Warning. Beware of aggressive otters," the flier read in part.
"Otters have recently attacked residents in the area...Otters may
carry rabies." Grand Harbor Director of Golf, Frank Mentzer, referred
questions to attorney and Grand Harbor Senior Vice President, Annabel
North, who did not return phone messages left Tuesday and Wednesday
[22 and 23 May 2007].
"It is not unusual for otters to be rabid," said Cheryl Dunn, county
director of environmental health. She said rabies virus is always in
the population of local raccoons, the chief animal carrier during
last fall's [2007] countywide rabies alert. "(Otters) compete with
raccoons for the same food and that puts them into contact," Dunn
said. "I know of a few (instances) in Brevard County of otters
getting right into fishing boats on the St. Johns River."
Dunn said one rabid otter does not indicate a widespread problem
among other otters living in the ponds at Grand Harbor. "They wanted
me and Animal Control to go out there and trap," Dunn said. "But we
don't go out and trap and remove entire populations." Instead,
officials have asked Grand Harbor residents to report any otters
behaving strangely. "If (an otter) moves toward you, be aware that it
may attack," the Grand Harbor flier warned. "Retreat immediately."
Since 4 Jan 2007, when Indian River Count lifted a 3-month-old
countywide alert for the disease, 10 people bitten or exposed to
raccoons, a stray cat, and an otter have been vaccinated against
rabies. In this most recent incident on 7 May 2007, the otter bit 3
people on a Grand Harbor golf course. Rabies is a virus transmitted
to humans through the bite or saliva of a warm-blooded animal. Left
untreated, it is usually fatal.
Tips to avoid exposure
1. Vaccinate dogs, cats, ferrets and horses against rabies.
Unvaccinated pets can be a bridge between wildlife and humans for the
rabies virus.
2. Don't feed wildlife or place food outside for domestic pets.
3. Be careful of places in your yard where raccoons might nest, such
as under tarps, covered boats, or piles of debris.
4. Don't handle wild animals and avoid stray dogs and cats.
If you are bitten, [consult immediately] a doctor, hospital, or
county Health Department. A series of vaccine [injections]
administered soon after a person is bitten or exposed to animal
saliva prevents the disease. The recommended deadline for getting
rabies shots is 10 days after exposure, but sooner is safer.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg [North Carolina] Animal Control officials say
they are alarmed that rabies cases might be on the rise again in the
area. Earlier this month [May 2007], [a resident of the Cotswold
community of southeast Charlotte] was working in his yard when a
raccoon jumped on his back and started biting him. "I didn't hear him
coming, and all of a sudden he was on me," he told WCNC-TV, the
Observer's news partner. "I could not break him loose." [The man] had
to undergo a series of [vaccine] shots to avoid coming down with
rabies, a neurological virus usually fatal to mammals. He is one of 2
cases of people exposed to rabies in Charlotte recently. Other cases
of attacks involving family pets, which then had to be euthanized,
also show rabies exposure increasing, authorities say.
"I think the problem is somewhat cyclical, and there are some signs
that it is increasing," said Mary Blinn, veterinarian at the
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Animal Control Bureau. There were 19 cases in
Mecklenburg County between last 1 Jul 2006, the start of the fiscal
year, and 15 May 2007, compared to 16 the year before [2005-2006],
and the number is still growing. On Sunday [27 May 2007], for
example, Animal Control officers were called to Connan Lane, off
Carmel Road, to deal with a possible rabid animal.
Numbers are not available for other nearby counties, but Cabarrus,
Iredell, and Union counties have averaged about a dozen cases over
the last 4 years. Fewer cases have been reported in Gaston and
Lincoln counties. [South Carolina] health officials also say the
number of cases is climbing.
Mecklenburg's current number is still less than the 50 cases reported
in fiscal year 2003 and the 32 cases in 2004. The last fatal rabies
case in North Carolina was in Cherokee County, 54 years ago.
While the spread of rabies can threaten people, the problem is bigger
for domestic animals that have not received rabies vaccinations. "If
your pet is exposed to an animal and has not been vaccinated, the
choices are sad," said Melissa Knicely-Berry of the Animal Control
Bureau. Pet owners can either pay about USD 3000 to have their dogs,
cats, or ferrets quarantined for 6 months, or by law, they must have
the pets euthanized. "With the expense involved, most people choose
euthanization," Knicely-Berry said. "And that's sad, because it's all
preventable."
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Animal Control Bureau has rabies shot
clinics planned, as do most nearby counties. "People should stay away
from wild animals, eliminate things that attract those animals to
yards, and make sure their pets are vaccinated," Blinn said.
Rabies is a preventable disease of mammals, most often transmitted by
the bite of a rabid animal. It is sometimes spread by saliva or other
body fluids of animals to people through skin cuts. The rabies virus
infects the central nervous system, eventually causing death.
So-called "dumb rabies" affects about one-quarter of animals that
catch the disease, causing them to withdraw and quietly die. More
common is "aggressive rabies," in which infected animals exhibit
aggressive characteristics.
In the Carolinas, rabies is spread most often by bats, foxes,
raccoons, and skunks, but there also have been cases involving
bobcats, coyotes, and groundhogs.
[North Carolina] law requires the owners of dogs, cats, and ferrets
to have their animals vaccinated by age 16 weeks, then again after
one year, and then every 3 years.
[South Carolina] law requires pets to be vaccinated by 4 months, with
additional shots every one year or 3 years, depending on the vaccine.
