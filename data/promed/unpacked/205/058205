FDA warns about "abortion pill" risk
------------------------------------
The United States government warned doctors on Tue 19 Jul 2005 to be on the
lookout for rare but deadly infections in women using the so-called
abortion pill RU-486, citing 2 more deaths after its use. At least 5 women
in the USA have died after taking the pill since it began selling in 2000,
although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stressed that it could not
prove the drug was to blame.
The 4 deaths caused by bloodstream infections, or sepsis, all occurred in
women who didn't follow FDA-approved instructions for a pill-triggered
abortion, said agency drug chief Dr Steven Galson. "We don't know that this
off-label use has caused the deaths," he cautioned.
The action comes just 8 months after the FDA warned about 2 sepsis cases
associated with Mifeprex, also called RU-486 or mifepristone. Additional
sepsis cases were reported to the agency in April and June 2005.
The drug, sold by Danco Laboratories, is approved to terminate pregnancy up
to 49 days after the beginning of the last menstrual cycle. It blocks a
hormone required to sustain a pregnancy. When followed by another medicine,
misoprostol, the pregnancy is terminated.
The FDA's instructions call for women to swallow both pills, but most
abortion clinics instead instruct that the misoprostol tablet be inserted
into the vagina, Galson said. Studies have shown it can work that way, too.
But the 4 sepsis deaths, all reported from California, came after this
so-called off-label use. Galson couldn't say whether the women had inserted
the tablet vaginally themselves. In 2 of the infections, doctors identified
a bacterium called _Clostridium sordellii_, a common germ not usually
associated with illness, he said.
The other USA death associated with Mifeprex was a case of a ruptured
ectopic, or tubal, pregnancy in October 2001. The drug is not to be used by
women with suspected or confirmed ectopic pregnancies, a life-threatening
condition in which the fertilized egg has implanted outside the uterus.

FDA issues public health advice on mifepristone
-----------------------------------------------
The FDA is investigating recently reported serious adverse events
associated with mifepristone (trade name Mifeprex, also known as RU-486).
As a result, the FDA is issuing public health advice today [Tue 19 Jul
2005] highlighting the risk of sepsis, or blood infection, when undergoing
medical abortion using Mifeprex and misoprostol in a manner that is not
consistent with the approved labeling. There are now 4 cases of deaths from
infection from September 2003 to June 2005 following medical abortion with
these drugs.
"The FDA is committed to sharing emerging drug information with the public,
and we believe it is important to share with health care providers and
patients the latest serious reports of infection associated with this drug
that we have received," said Dr Steven Galson, acting director of FDA's
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
The bacteria thought to have caused the fatal infection have been
identified in 2 of the cases, and the other 2 cases are under investigation
by FDA along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and
local health departments, and the manufacturer of Mifeprex.
Doctors are urged to have a higher level of suspicion for sepsis in their
patients taking Mifeprex.
Previously, the FDA has received reports of serious bacterial infection,
bleeding, ectopic pregnancies that have ruptured, and death. Those reports
led to the revision of the black box labeling. Mifeprex was approved by the
FDA in 2000.

[2 of the 4 sepsis deaths were related to _Clostridium sordellii_. Although
rare, the medical literature contains a number of reports regarding the
organism's pathogenicity. Prior to the recognition of _C. difficile_, it
was thought that _C. sordellii_ played a role in pseudomembranous
enterocolitis, since antitoxins directed against _C. sordellii_ could
neutralize the toxin that causes this condition.
Non-obstetrical infections caused by _C. sordellii_ include pneumonia and
empyema (1), endocarditis (2), bacteremia with or without gas gangrene
(myonecrosis) (3), necrotizing fasciitis in black-tar heroin users (4),
endophthalmitis (5), and neonatal omphalitis (infection of the umbilical
stump) (6). In addition, the organism has been associated with contaminated
musculoskeletal tissue allografts (7). These latter infections were
described in ProMED-mail in 2001 and 2002.
Fatal postpartum infection with _C. sordellii_, spontaneous endometritis
(uterine infection) (8-10), and fatal _C. sordellii_ infection associated
with medical abortion have all been reported (11). These cases tend to be
fulminant toxic shock-like illnesses associated with a markedly elevated
white blood cell count and massive capillary leak with loss of plasma from
the intravascular space (11). It appears that vaginal colonization with
_Clostridium_ sp. increases during pregnancy, and the overwhelming toxemia
is a manifestation of ascending infection to the inner lining of an area
(the pregnant (or peripregnant) uterus able to absorb the toxin.

To further discuss this issue regarding the use of medical abortion, ProMED
has asked Ms Arielle Lutwick, consultant, Reproductive Health Technology
Project, Washington DC to add to the discussion:
Approved in September 2000, mifepristone is a safe and effective drug that
offers women a non-surgical option for pregnancy termination, an option
that many women feel affords them greater privacy and autonomy.
Mifepristone, like every drug, presents a certain degree of risk. However,
that risk should be considered in the context of the broader risk of
maternal mortality.
Serious and sometimes fatal infections occur very rarely following
miscarriage and surgical and medical abortions, and the risk of infection
following medical abortion remains very low. A few statistics: In the USA,
reports of all infections following Mifeprex are well below 1 per cent. To
put the safety of medical abortion in perspective, there are about 13
pregnancy-related deaths per 100 000 live births, according to the CDC.
Abortion, whether medical or surgical, is much safer than pregnancy and
childbirth. Furthermore, it should be understood that the "off label" use
of mifepristone itself does not present a risk to women who use the drug.
Evidence-based regimens of mifepristone medical abortion are widely used in
the USA and abroad, which reduce rather than increase a woman's risk of
serious side effects.
The challenge now for health care professionals, patient advocates, and
health journalists will be to communicate accurate and clear information
about these methods so women who are considering the option of abortion can
make informed decisions. For more information about the revised
mifepristone labeling, see:
