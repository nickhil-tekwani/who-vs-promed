Totally unintentionally I have caused some anguish and annoyance in posting
this RFH, in that I included a remark by one of those involved in this
serological research. I deeply apologise for this error.
In mitigation I would point out that the original correspondence that came
to me requesting aid was lengthy as the requestor had not composed the
necessary request but stated that the information was in the attached
documentation. The latter went back to November 1997 and covered five pages,
a string of some 8-10 individuals through whom the correspondence had been
passed - each one merely adding his or her comments to the top of this ever
growing string, plus evidence of multiples of copies sideways. Thus any
early private comments, such as by Akiro Ito, had ceased to be so. His
wording indicated to me that he and Victor Tsang were in a measure of mutual
agreement as to the comparative advantage of Ito's methodology. Obviously
this is not the case. Those wishing more details as to this research should
contact those gentlemen directly.
This thread is cut.
