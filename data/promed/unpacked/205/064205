A Comment on "Mouse Fever" in Ulyanovsk
----------------------------------------
[Professor Henttonen has sent the following information, which clarifies
the nature of the outbreak described in the ProMED-mail post archived as
"Hemorrhagic fever - Russia (Ulyanovsk) 20031118.2867. - Mod.CP]
Ulyanovsk is situated on the Volga River (Russia). These and nearby regions
(including Samara, south of Ulyanovsk) are well-known for the high number
of Puumala hantavirus infections, spread by the bank vole (_Clethrionomys
glareolus_) and consequent human epidemics.
Thousands of people have become ill in the worst years, and some of these
epidemics, like the one in Samara a couple of years ago, have also been
reported in ProMED-mail [see references below].
Nephropathia epidemica, the mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome, caused by Puumala hantavirus, is only rarely fatal (case fatality
rate clearly less than 1 percent). Human infections typically occur in late
autumn or early winter, when the bank voles often invade human dwellings.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Professor Henttonen's prompt response to the
request for further information, and for confirming that the "mouse fever"
described in the report from Ulyanovsk is indeed a hantavirus infection.
_Puumala virus_ is recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV) as a distinct virus species in the genus _Hantavirus_ of the
family _Bunyaviridae_. - Mod.CP]
