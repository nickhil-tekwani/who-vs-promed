http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/10/new-drc-ebola-cases-confirmed-fda-oks-rapid-test
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The World Health Organization (WHO) tracked 2 new Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) today [Fri 11 Oct 2019] on its outbreak dashboard, lifting the outbreak total to 3210 cases, including 2146 deaths. Officials are still investigating 421 suspected cases.

The news comes as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved its 1st Ebola rapid diagnostic test.

The new cases are likely part of the "trickle" that Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of health emergencies, said was to be expected as transmission slows and the outbreak shrinks to a small region that straddles North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

Ryan made those comments yesterday [Thu 10 Oct 2019] during a press conference that, for the most part, presented encouraging data. In recent weeks, new cases have declined, with only single cases confirmed on several days in the past week.

The Ebola outbreak will be declared over when 42 days, or two 21-day transmission cycles, pass with no new cases.

Progress tinged with caution
----------------------------
In its latest disease outbreak news update, the WHO echoed Ryan's remarks. "There is a shift in hot spots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, across a more concentrated geographical area," the WHO said, noting that 14 cases had been recorded from [30 Sep -- 6 Oct 2019].

Since September [2019], almost 4 of 5 confirmed cases have come from four health zones: Mandima (31%), Mambasa (29%), Komanda (10%,), and Oicha (8%). Today [Fri 11 Oct 2019], the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said the single case reported yesterday [Thu 10 Oct 2019] was in Lolwa.

As reported earlier, the WHO said response activities resumed in Lwemba this past week, after security incidents in mid-September [2019] halted all activity for more than 2 weeks. "Response activities have since resumed but remain limited. Improved access may result in enhanced case finding and contact tracing therefore could result in an increase in the number of reported cases and contacts in the area," the WHO said.

The WHO also warned that the recent decline in cases should be interpreted cautiously. "The situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security," the WHO said.

New rapid Ebola test OK'd to sell
---------------------------------
Yesterday [Thu 10 Oct 2019] the FDA allowed for marketing a new rapid diagnostic test for Ebola, the OraQuick Ebola Rapid Antigen Test. This is the 1st rapid Ebola test approved for sale in the United States, the FDA said in a news release.

"The ability to use this test to promptly make a presumptive Ebola diagnosis could help providers to more quickly isolate patients and begin treatments that can be potentially life-saving," said Acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless, MD. "Additionally, this device could be used to support safe and dignified burials while helping to reduce the risk of transmission during those burials."

OraQuick provides a presumptive diagnosis that must be confirmed, the FDA said. The test was developed during the 2014--2016 West African outbreak and is meant to be used on symptomatic patients and in recently deceased patients with suspected Ebola.

The test was made available during the West Africa outbreak and subsequent DRC outbreaks via the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization pathway.

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Mike Ryan, MD, the World Health Organization (WHO) executive director of health emergencies, said today that the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been "squeezed into a small geographical area"--a triangle between Mambasa, Beni, Mandima, and Komanda.

"The virus is now back to where it began in Mandima, the same rural zones where it transmitted at low intensity for several months before last August [2019]," Ryan said in a press conference.

It is in this shared space between North Kivu and Ituri provinces where the virus will see its final days, Ryan said, as transmission has slowed to a trickle.

Ryan offered several signs that the tide has turned on the DRC's 14-month-long Ebola outbreak, the 2nd largest in history:

- Currently, only 27 health zones in the DRC are affected by the deadly virus, down from 207 at the outbreak's peak.
- The disease has been pushed out of the region's bigger cities, including Katwa, Beni, and Butembo.
- The R0 (R-naught), how many cases each confirmed case infects on average, is now at an outbreak low of 0.69.
- And less than 1% of recent deaths have occurred in the community, which lowers the risk of transmission.

"Now we have to kill the virus," Ryan said. "And we can only end the outbreak if we maintain the response."

Keys to ending outbreak
-----------------------
Ryan said there were several keys to ending transmission. First, there will be increased community surveillance in the outbreak zones, which will be challenging. The current hot spots are in villages with high activity from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a militant terrorist organization.

Second, surveillance around Beni also needs to be increased.

"There is always a chance for further amplification," Ryan said.

Today the WHO will determine if the outbreak still warrants a public health emergency of international concern.

[This report states that the "R0 of Ebola is now as low as 0.69." In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio and denoted R0, R nought) of an infection can be thought of as the number of cases one case generates on average over the course of its infectious period, in an otherwise uninfected population (Fraser C, Donnelly CA, Cauchemez S, et al. Pandemic Potential of a Strain of Influenza A (H1N1): Early Findings. Science. 2009 Jun 19;324(5934):1557-61, < https://science.sciencemag.org/content/324/5934/1557.long>). But it is more correct to look at the effective reproduction number in a population where there is not 100% susceptibility. A recent paper examines misunderstanding of R0: Delamater PL, Street EJ, Leslie TF, et al. Complexity of the Basic Reproduction Number (R0). Emerg Infect Dis. 2019;25(1):1-4. https://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2501.171901. Following is an excerpt from the paper where the authors examine R0 and vaccination campaigns. Reading of the entire paper is recommended.

"R0 and Vaccination Campaigns
Vaccination campaigns reduce the proportion of a population at risk for infection and have proven to be highly effective in mitigating future outbreaks (26). This conclusion is sometimes used to suggest that an aim of vaccination campaigns is to remove susceptible members of the population to reduce the R0 for the event to less than 1. Although the removal of susceptible members from the population will affect infection transmission by reducing the number of effective contacts between infectious and susceptible persons, this activity will technically not reduce the R0 value because the definition of R0 includes the assumption of a completely susceptible population. When examining the effect of vaccination, the more appropriate metric to use is the effective reproduction number (R), which is similar to R0 but does not assume complete susceptibility of the population and, therefore, can be estimated with populations having immune members (16,20,27). Efforts aimed at reducing the number of susceptible persons within a population through vaccination would result in a reduction of the R value, rather than R0 value. In this scenario, vaccination could potentially end an epidemic, if R can be reduced to a value less than 1 (16,27,28). The effective reproduction number can also be specified at a particular time t, presented as R(t) or Rt, which can be used to trace changes in R as the number of susceptible members in a population is reduced (29,30). When the goal is to measure the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns or other public health interventions, R0 is not necessarily the best metric (10,20)." - Mod LK]

The number of reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) consistently declined in recent weeks, with 14 new confirmed cases reported in North Kivu and Ituri provinces during the epidemiological week of 30 Sep through 6 Oct 2019 (Figure 1). At peak transmission in April 2019, there were 126 cases in the week. Although the decline in case incidence is encouraging, it must be interpreted with caution as the situation remains highly contingent upon the level of access and security.

In mid-September [2019], serious security incidents in Lwemba Health Area, Mandima Health Zone, stalled outbreak response activities for more than 2 weeks. To improve confidence and community engagement in response activities, an open forum for discussion and reconciliation was held in Lwemba with partners and civil society last week. Response activities have since resumed but remain limited. Improved access may result in enhanced case finding and contact tracing therefore could result in an increase in the number of reported cases and contacts in the area.

There is a shift in hot spots from urban settings to more rural, hard-to-reach communities, across a more concentrated geographical area. During the past 21 days (from 18 Sep through 8 Oct 2019), a total of 59 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), with almost 4 out of 5 confirmed cases from 4 health zones: Mandima (31%, n=18), Mambasa (29%, n=17), Komanda (10%, n=6), Oicha (8%, n=5). This brings additional challenges to the response, including an extremely volatile security situation, difficulty accessing some remote areas, relatively poorer Ebola awareness and delays to engaging with the community leading to mistrust and misunderstandings, and potential under-reporting of cases, especially around some mining sites. The occurrence of transmission along a major road in from Komanda and Mambasa also poses greater risk of spread westward to other major cities in the country (such as to Kisangani).

As of [8 Oct 2019], a total of 3207 EVD cases were reported, including 3093 confirmed and 114 probable cases, of which 2144 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 59% (n=1797) were female, 31% (n=909) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=162) were health workers.

As of [4 Oct 2019], 1000 people have survived EVD in this outbreak. Since November 2018, the Ministry of Health and the Institute of Biomedical Research laboratory, with support from WHO, have undertaken a programme to aid in the reintegration of survivors into the community. The programme provides to EVD survivors monthly clinical, biological and psychological follow-up for a year after their discharge from the treatment center. Currently there are 3 operational clinics located in Beni, Butembo and Mangina.

Under Pillar 1 of the current Strategic Response Plan, the estimated funding requirement for all partners for the period July to December 2019 is USD 287 million, including USD 120-140 million for WHO. As of [10 Oct 2019], USD 60.4 million have been received by WHO, with additional funds committed or pledged. Further resources are needed to fund the response through to December 2019 and into the first quarter of 2020.

Under Pillar 5, Regional Preparedness, the funding requirement for all partners is USD 66 million, of which WHO requires USD 21 million. As of [8 Oct 2019], WHO has received USD 1.6 million. Whilst some additional pledges are in the pipeline, increased funding for preparedness in neighboring countries is urgently needed. WHO is appealing to donors to provide generous support. A summary of funding received by WHO since the start of this outbreak can be found here.

Vaccine Research
- Fri 11 Oct 2019. Vaccine: Glycoprotein nanoparticle
https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiz518/5585635?searchresult=1
Citation: Fries L, Cho I, Krahling V, et al. A Randomized, Blinded, Dose-Ranging Trial of an Ebola Virus Glycoprotein (EBOV GP) Nanoparticle Vaccine with Matrix-M ™ Adjuvant in Healthy Adults, J Infect Dis. 2019. pii: jiz518

Abstract.
Methods: A phase 1, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial was conducted in 230 healthy adults to evaluate 4 EBOV GP antigen doses as single- or 2-dose regimens with or without adjuvant. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed through 1-year post-dosing.

Results: All EBOV GP vaccine formulations were well tolerated. Receipt of 2 doses of EBOV GP with adjuvant showed a rapid increase in anti-EBOV GP IgG titers with peak titers observed on Day 35 representing 498- to 754-fold increases from baseline; no evidence of an antigen dose-response was observed. Serum EBOV-neutralizing and binding antibodies using wild-type ZEBOV or pseudovirion assays were 3- to 9-fold higher among recipients of 2-dose EBOV GP with adjuvant, compared with placebo on Day 35, which persisted through 1 year.

Conclusions: EBOV GP vaccine with Matrix-M adjuvant is well tolerated and elicits a robust and persistent immune response. These data suggest that further development of this candidate vaccine for prevention of EBOV disease is warranted.
