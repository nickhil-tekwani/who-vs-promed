Allahabad [district] guavas enjoy a heavy demand across the country.
But this year [2007-08], orchard owners have suffered a major
setback. As the mercury takes a dip in northern India, Allahabad's
famous guava varieties are bugged by a disease named "Ukta" [guava
wilt] that attacks the fruit's moisture and turns it dry and pale.

"This season [2007-08] Ukta disease has destroyed a major portion of
the guava crop here. The disease generally spoils old trees and the
only solution is to replenish orchards with new trees at the right
time. Orchardists have suffered major losses this year," said Dr LS
Yadav, the Horticultural officer with the Department of Agriculture
in Allahabad.

"Allahabad is famous for its 7 varieties of guava. At least 70 to 80
percent of these varieties are bugged with Ukta, which is a fungal
infection that destroys roots," said Dr Brijesh Dwivedi, a botanist.

Guava, also known as the 'poor man's fruit' is popular in tropical
and subtropical climates and is native to India. Hence it is also
named the 'Apple of tropics'. Allahabad holds an enviable position in
terms of quality guava production. Around 10 tonnes of guava are
expected to hit the markets from the orchards in the vicinity of
Allahabad.

[A soil-borne fungal wilt of guava was first reported from this area
in the 1950s and attributed to _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _psidii_.
A number of other fungi including _F. solani_, _F. longipes_,
_Gibberella fujikuroi_, _Macrophomina phaseolina_, _Clonostachys
rosea_, _Verticillium albo-atrum_ and _Rhizoctonia_ species have
since been reported from wilt-affected guava plants in India. Spiral
nematodes (_Helicotylenchus dihystera_) may also be involved in
disease development. A 'slow' and a 'quick' form of wilt are reported
which may be due to different pathogen combinations.

Guava wilt is spreading in the region. It is now considered a serious
national problem and the most important disease of this crop in
India. The disease leads to decline and eventual death of the tree
and is often more severe in plants subjected to other stress factors.
Heavy yield losses of up to 70 percent have been recorded. Most of
the fungi are soil-borne and may also be spread with infected plant
material and by mechanical means. Disease management includes
cultural practices (removal of infected trees, soil solarisation) and
fungicides. Biological control methods are being investigated.
Severity of wilt symptoms varies in different guava cultivars.

Guava wilt diseases have also been reported from some other Asian
countries, Africa, and the Americas. The pathogens involved in these
areas may include different species such as the fungus _Myxosporium
psidii_ or root-knot (_Meloidogyne_ species) nematodes.
