Florida's Lee County has issued an outbreak warning for chickenpox
after 41 confirmed cases of the disease have hit children since
February [2010]. The outbreak has affected children of all ages in
all part of the county, Jennifer James-Mesloh, a spokeswoman for the
county health departments, told Naplesnews.com. Most of the
chickenpox cases in Lee County have occurred in elementary [school]
aged children.

Typically, Lee County sees only 15 cases of chickenpox in a year,
with 12 reported in 2008 and 15 in 2009. A spokesman for the Lee
County School District told NaplesNews.com that an unusual number of
chickenpox cases began to be reported by school nurses in February
2010. The county health department was then notified. James-Mesloh
said that the large increase in reported cases should serve as notice
for parents to have their children vaccinated. A vaccine for
chickenpox was released in 1995. That vaccine has lowered the number
of outbreaks, James-Mesloh said, but is most effective when a 2nd
dose is administered. The vaccine has a 97 percent success rate for
children who receive a 2nd dose. Most of the Lee County cases
occurred in children who only received one dose of the vaccine.

Only 3-5 percent of vaccine recipients report any side effects, which
include mild rashes near the site of injection.

[Chickenpox (varicella) is a common childhood disease. It is usually
mild, but it can be serious, especially in young infants and adults.
It causes a rash, itching, fever, and tiredness. It can lead to
severe skin infection, scars, pneumonia, brain damage, or death. The
chickenpox virus can be spread from person to person through the air
or by contact with fluid from chickenpox blisters. A person who has
had chickenpox can get a painful rash called shingles later in life.

Children who have never had chickenpox should get 2 doses of
chickenpox vaccine at 12-15 months of age and a 2nd dose at 4-6 years
of age. A combination vaccine, which contains both chickenpox and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines, may be given instead of the 2
individual vaccines to people 12 years of age and younger. Before the
vaccine, about 11 000 people were hospitalized for chickenpox each
year in the United States, and about 100 people died each year as a
result of chickenpox in the United States.

It is likely that the outbreak in Florida is occurring mainly among
children who have not been vaccinated or who have only received a
single dose of varicella virus vaccine. Further information would be welcomed.
