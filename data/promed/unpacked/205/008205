The patient is stable in serious condition. He was admitted in the Los Angeles Base Hospital this past 14 Feb [2012], after having become infected at a scout campout at Alto Antuco.

This Friday [17 Feb 2012], the Bio-Bio Health Services authorities will meet with the families of the other 100 people who participated in the campout, to provide them with recommendations about possible symptoms that indicate a suspected infection.

The Institute of Public Health (ISP) confirmed the presence of [a] hantavirus [or antibodies?] in samples taken from a 26-year-old patient who is interned in the Rancagua Hospital.

According to preliminary information the young man contracted the virus in the rural area of Santa Amalia in the Pichidegua community, and began to have symptoms yesterday afternoon [15 Feb 2012], which motivated his going to the Rancagua Hospital.

The regional hospital has not issued an official report concerning this patient. Meanwhile the Health Service initiated a census in the area to determine if the so-called "long-tailed rat" [long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_] is present.

The Institute of Public Health in Santiago confirmed the 1st case in the Los Rios region of [a] hantavirus [infection] this year [2012]. The case is a man from the Corral community who is currently in stable condition in the Valdivia Base Hospital. This was confirmed by the Health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit], Dr Richard Rios, who stated that the patient is a 48 year old man who went to the Corral Hospital due to a high fever, general malaise, and respiratory problems this past 5 Feb [2012]; later was sent to the Valdivia regional hospital on 12 [Feb 2012], where he was admitted.

Richard Rios added that the tests on the patient, who had been working around a trash dump, were sent to the Institute of Public Health, a facility that this afternoon [15 Feb 2012] confirmed the suspicion of the virus [infection] in the patient. Rios indicated that the man was currently stable, without requiring mechanical ventilation so far.

In 2011, there were 7 cases of infected individuals in the region, one in Paillaco, another in Valdivia, and the 5 cases in the Corral community where there were 2 deaths, which resulted in the declaration of a health alert in this community and the implementation of an emergency plan, with inter-agency efforts, that had emphasis on rodent control, weed elimination, and activities to promote education about the virus, among others.

This past Saturday [11 Feb 2012], a young woman 21 years old who had arrived from Formosa province in January 2012, died in the Esquel Zonal Hospital. According to a statement by Dr Edgar Schvemer, chief of the Program Area, "it is a case clinically compatible with [a] hantavirus [infection]." He also indicated that they await the results of laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, which will arrive during the course of the week.

He explained that the place where the infection was acquired is undetermined, however, "we are carrying out relevant field work. We know that she camped for a day in the Lake Futalaufquen area, and she also was involved in cleanup activities in the police academy," he added and stated that "we can not confirm with assurance, where she was infected." Also, he did not discard [the possibility] that she might have been infected in Formosa province.

The Esquel Program Area director said that this is the 1st case detected so far in 2012.

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2011). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified.

As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_) virus. Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved.

If the infection is confirmed and was acquired at Lake Futalaufquen, the virus involved was most likely Andes virus. If the infection was acquired in Formosa province, Lechiguana or Oran viruses are the possible hantaviruses involved in this case.
