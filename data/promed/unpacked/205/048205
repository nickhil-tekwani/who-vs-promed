Sarawak Assistant Minister of Public Health Datuk Dr Jerip Susil said knowlesi malaria was transmitted from monkeys to humans and could be fatal as the virus is more destructive to human red blood cells.

The Sarawak Health Department is on high alert following the discovery of a new type of malaria known as knowlesi malaria, which was detected at Mile 13 of the Kuching-Serian Road area. The State's Assistant Minister of Public Health Datuk Dr Jerip Susil said knowlesi malaria was transmitted from monkeys to humans and could be fatal as the virus is more destructive to humans' red blood cells compared to other malaria viruses.

He told The Borneo Post that there is a possibility the disease could have been transmitted by some hunters from nearby villages, such as Kampung Seratau, Kampung Sedenu, and Kampung Kutan, who could have been infected by monkeys while hunting at Bukit Kuap in the Mile 13 area. At the moment, he said it was endemic only at the Mile 13 area and was still under control.

To control the spread of the disease, Dr Jerip said the Health Department was taking all the necessary precautions such as advising residents in the affected villages to stop hunting in the suspected area. "We also carry out fogging and advise people to use mosquito nets," he said. When contacted, State Health Department director Datu Dr Zulkifli Jantan confirmed that the disease was rampant only at the Mile 13 area.

He said the cumulative number of reported cases last year was 1098, including 97 reported in the 1st 10 weeks of this year [2015].

Residents of the area confirmed that various species of monkeys were found in Bukit Kuap. A resident of RPR Flat at Mile 13, Dominic Semalih Uding, 23, said there were instances when the monkeys came to their backyards but they were scared away by children who threw firecrackers at them. "Now, we don't see them coming near here anymore. But we still can hear their noises up in the hills," he said.

[The natural host of _Plasmodium knowlesi_ is the macaque monkey and the present understanding is that human cases are infected from the monkeys and that human to human transmission does not occur. _P. knowlesi_ is well known to occur in Sarawak, especially in the forested areas towards the border to Indonesian Borneo where it is endemic. _P. knowlesi_ occurs in all areas of Southeast Asia where the macaque monkey is distributed. - Mod.EP
