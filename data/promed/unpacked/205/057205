Spatial and Temporal Association of Outbreaks of H5N1 Influenza Virus
Infection in Wild Birds with the 0 DEG C Isotherm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Wild bird movements and aggregations following spells of cold weather
may have resulted in the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza
virus (HPAIV) H5N1 in Europe during the winter of 2005-2006.
Waterbirds are constrained in winter to areas where bodies of water
remain unfrozen in order to feed. On the one hand, waterbirds may
choose to winter as close as possible to their breeding grounds in
order to conserve energy for subsequent reproduction, and may be
displaced by cold fronts. On the other hand, waterbirds may choose to
winter in regions where adverse weather conditions are rare, and may
be slowed by cold fronts upon their journey back to the breeding
grounds, which typically starts before the end of winter.

Waterbirds will thus tend to aggregate along cold fronts close to the
0 DEG C [32 DEG F] isotherm during winter, creating conditions that
favour HPAIV H5N1 transmission and spread. We determined that the
occurrence of outbreaks of HPAIV H5N1 infection in waterbirds in
Europe during the winter of 2005-2006 was associated with
temperatures close to 0 DEG C. The analysis suggests a significant
spatial and temporal association of outbreaks caused by HPAIV H5N1 in
wild birds with maximum surface air temperatures of 0-2 DEG C
[32-35.6 DEG F] on the day of the outbreaks and the 2 preceding days.

At locations where waterbird census data have been collected since
1990, maximum mallard counts occurred when average and maximum
surface air temperatures were 0 DEG C and 3 DEG C [37.4 DEG F],
respectively. Overall, the abundance of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos)
and common pochards (Aythya ferina) was highest when surface air
temperatures were lower than the mean temperatures of the region
investigated. The analysis implies that waterbird movements
associated with cold weather, and congregation of waterbirds along
the 0 DEG C isotherm likely contributed to the spread and
geographical distribution of outbreaks of HPAIV H5N1 infection in
wild birds in Europe during the winter of 2005-2006.

Author Summary
--------------
Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype emerged
more than a decade ago in poultry in South-East Asia. In 2005, it
spread outside Asia infecting both poultry and wild birds in the
Middle East, Europe and Africa. Both trade of poultry and movements
of wild birds were likely implicated in the spread of the infection;
however, the ability of wild birds to carry the virus to novel
geographical areas is still highly debated and remains obscure. In
Europe, the virus mainly infected wild birds, and emergence coincided
with a spell of cold weather, which is known to result in massive
movements of wild waterbirds.

In this paper, we demonstrate that movements of wild waterbirds
associated with cold weather contributed to the spread and
geographical distribution of outbreaks in Europe during the winter of
2005-2006. Higher density of wild waterbirds on bodies of water that
remain unfrozen ahead of the freezing line likely favoured
transmission of the virus and resulted in distinctive distribution of
outbreaks at locations where surface air temperatures were 0-2 DEG C
[32-35.6 DEG F]. This has important implications for surveillance,
which should target areas where temperatures are close to freezing in
winter, especially in poultry-dense regions close to areas where
waterfowl aggregate.

[That the HPAI viruses follow the path of LPAI viruses of needing
open water is not surprising. A now classic series of papers in this
context of AI viruses in migratory water birds by David Stallknecht

At the right water pH, salinity, and temperature the AI viruses,
whether HP or LP, have the potential for long survivals and
attractive water sites will be revisited by other incoming flocks of
water birds. - Mod.MHJ]

Re: "[1] Raptors droppings" in: Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory
birds (02)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I agree that raptors tend to defecate predominately while roosting,
but they also defecate while flying. Hence, although small, there is
a likelihood that a domestic flock might encounter raptor droppings
released in-flight.

See: Ref 1. Edna Gorney & Yoram Yom-Tov (1994). Fat, hydration
condition, and moult of Steppe Buzzards Buteo buteo vulpinus on
spring migration. IBIS 136: 185-192.

[Migrating Steppe Buzzards were captured, as part of a raptor ringing
project, during 5 consecutive spring migration seasons between March
and May 1984-1988 north of Elat, Israel (Ref 1). In total, 1001
immatures and 459 adults were trapped. The paper includes a map
showing breeding and wintering grounds of the Steppe Buzzard and
recovery sites of ringed buzzards. The abstract includes the
following: "These findings suggest that different age groups use
different migration strategies. Most of the buzzards trapped in this
study could not have completed their entire migration using only
stored fat: thus, hunting was probably necessary to replenish their
energy reserves." The authors used an average flight speed of 300 km
per day. - Mod.AS]

[Let us try to underpin this with a risk assessment denominator. Just
guessing but let us assume that an infected but not-ill vulture will
defaecate twice during a 300 Kms flight stage and each virus filled
faecal mass will splat cover an area of some 100 sq. cms., or with 2
defaecations 200 sq. cms, over some 30 000 000 cms of flight.
Something like a one in 150 000 chance per infected vulture. Given
that some will fall in unsuitable habitat for secondary bird
exposure, such as woodland or open water, the chances are even
thinner. Put another way, ground defaecation at a rest/feeding site
is probably significantly more risky that aerial defaecation. - Mod.MHJ]
