[1] Mix-and-match vaccines [heterologous prime-boost]
[A] FDA to allow mixed vaccines

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is planning to allow Americans to receive a different COVID-19 vaccine as a booster from the one they initially received, a move that could reduce the appeal of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and provide flexibility to doctors and other vaccinators.

The government would not recommend one shot over another, and it might note that using the same vaccine as a booster when possible is preferable, people familiar with the agency's planning said. But vaccine providers could use their discretion to offer a different brand, a freedom that state health officials have been requesting for weeks.

The approach was foreshadowed on Friday [15 Oct 2021] when researchers presented the findings of a federally funded "mix and match" study to an expert committee that advises the Food and Drug Administration. The study found that recipients of Johnson & Johnson's single-dose shot who received a Moderna booster saw their antibody levels rise 76-fold in 15 days, compared with only a 4-fold increase after an extra dose of Johnson & Johnson.

Federal regulators this week are aiming to greatly expand the number of Americans eligible for booster shots. The FDA is expected to authorize boosters of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by Wednesday [20 Oct 2021] evening; it could allow the mix-and-match approach by then. The agency last month [September 2021] authorized booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for at least 6 months after the 2nd dose.

An advisory committee of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will take up the booster issue on Thursday [21 Oct 2021]; the agency will then issue its own recommendations. By the end of the week, tens of millions more Americans could be eligible for extra shots.

The study presented to the FDA's advisory panel last week, conducted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), suggested that Johnson & Johnson recipients might benefit most from a booster shot of the Moderna vaccine. A shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also raised the antibody levels of Johnson & Johnson recipients more than Johnson & Johnson did, the study found, although not as much as Moderna did. The NIH researchers tested a full dose of Moderna's vaccine for a booster shot, but regulators are also considering whether to authorize a half dose.

Experts emphasized last week that the new data were based on small groups of volunteers and short-term findings. Only antibody levels -- one measure of the immune response -- were calculated as part of the preliminary data, not the levels of immune cells primed to attack the coronavirus, which scientists say are also an important measure of a vaccine's success.

The study's researchers warned against using the findings to conclude that any one combination of vaccines was better. The study "was not powered or designed to compare between groups," said Dr. Kirsten E. Lyke, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who presented the data.

While the research on mixing and matching doses is somewhat thin, even some scientists who have strongly criticized the Biden administration's booster policy said that providers should be given a measure of discretion as the campaign ramps up. "If you look at the data, it certainly looks like it might be better," Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said of Moderna or Pfizer boosters for Johnson & Johnson recipients. "I think we should move quickly on this, because it's already happening."

At the meeting on Friday [15 Oct 2021] of the Food and Drug Administration's expert panel, of which Dr. Offit is a member, top CDC officials argued that providers needed latitude to offer different vaccines as boosters because patients might have had adverse reactions after their initial shots or presented other new concerns. Providers also might not have access to a vaccine a patient initially received, they said.

The federal government will cover the cost of a different vaccine as a booster only if the Food and Drug Administration authorizes the approach, officials said. "I'd like to reiterate how important it is from a programmatic perspective to have a little bit of flexibility," Dr. Melinda Wharton, a top vaccine official at the CDC, told the FDA panel. "From a public health perspective, there's a clear need in some situations for individuals to receive a different vaccine," said Dr. Amanda Cohn, another high-ranking CDC official.

Both Moderna and Pfizer require 2 initial doses, separated by about a month. Regulators are expected to follow the same approach they took with Pfizer's vaccine and authorize a booster of Moderna's vaccine about 6 months after the 2nd shot. Johnson & Johnson is headed for a booster shot of its vaccine at least 2 months after the 1st dose.

State health officials have been arguing for weeks that recipients of booster shots should not be strictly bound to the vaccine they initially received, for reasons such as supply, patient choice, and ease of administration. "The No. 1 thing I heard from state health secretaries was the need for permissive language around a mix-and-match approach," said Dr. Nirav D. Shah, Maine's top health official and the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.

Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia's COVID-19 czar, said the state had a greater supply of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines than of Johnson & Johnson's, so officials there might prefer to use them for boosters out of convenience. Others said the option of switching vaccines could streamline the administration of boosters.

"The impetus for states and local health departments was that if they were going to go out to a community site or long-term care facility and start providing boosters, it was a little inefficient to show up somewhere and say, 'We're just doing the people who got Pfizer,'" said Dr. Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. "When you have a captive audience, you want to take advantage of that."

Yet more options could lead to more confusion about booster shots, some experts have said. The Food and Drug Administration this week is expected to authorize boosters for all Johnson & Johnson recipients 18 and older. But the only Moderna recipients who are expected to become eligible for boosters are those who are at least 65 or otherwise considered at high risk, following the same eligibility requirements for recipients of Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine.

Jeannette Y. Lee, a biostatistician at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and a member of the FDA's expert committee, warned on Friday [15 Oct 2021] that allowing people to switch from their original vaccine type could be "very, very messy in terms of the messaging."

It remains unclear what dosage of Moderna's vaccine might be authorized for use as a booster for recipients of other vaccines. Last week, the advisory committee voted unanimously to recommend that Moderna recipients receive a 3rd shot of that vaccine as a booster, but at only half a dose.

Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, publicly suggested on Sunday [17 Oct 2021] that the government was headed toward granting greater leeway, at least for Johnson & Johnson (J&J) recipients. "I believe there's going to be a degree of flexibility of what a person who got the J&J originally can do, either with J&J or with the mix-and-match from other products," he said on "Fox News Sunday."

Just over 15 million people have been fully vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, compared with 69.5 million for Moderna's and 104.5 million with Pfizer-BioNTech's.

[B] Scientific rationale
Date: Tue 19 Oct 2021
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/covid-vaccine-mix-match.html


In recent years, some vaccine researchers have experimented with a switch from one vaccine to another for the 2nd dose. This strategy is technically known as a heterologous prime-boost.

The pandemic spurred more research into this possibility. One of the 1st authorized heterologous prime-boost vaccines for any disease is the Sputnik V vaccine, developed last year [2020] by Russian researchers to prevent COVID-19. It uses 2 different adenoviruses to deliver coronavirus proteins, which the immune system then attacks. The 1st dose contains an adenovirus called Ad5, and the 2nd contains another, called Ad26.

Scientists have long suspected that heterologous prime-boosts sometimes work better than 2 identical doses. The designers of the Sputnik V vaccine were concerned that the 1st shot of Ad5 would create antibodies not just against the coronavirus proteins it delivered, but also against Ad5 itself. A 2nd shot of Ad5 might be wiped out by people's immune systems before it could boost protection against COVID-19.

Studies of experimental HIV vaccines also suggested that mixing vaccines could create a broader, more potent response than multiple doses of a single vaccine. Different types stimulate the immune system in different ways, and switching between 2 vaccines might give people the best of both worlds.

The pandemic gave scientists new opportunities to test that idea. As the AstraZeneca vaccine was quickly rolled out in Europe, it became clear that younger recipients run a small but real risk of developing blood clots. Young people who had already received one dose of AstraZeneca were offered a 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech.

The 2 vaccines are profoundly different. AstraZeneca's formulation is based on a chimpanzee adenovirus. Pfizer and BioNTech make their vaccine with mRNA. When researchers looked at the immune response from this heterologous prime-boost, they found that it produced more antibodies than 2 shots of AstraZeneca alone.

A larger trial with 830 volunteers took place in Britain. Researchers gave 2 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to some of the volunteers, 2 shots of Pfizer-BioNTech to others, and a mix to the rest. They found no concerning evidence that a heterologous prime-boost caused dangerous side effects. (Still, in their report, published last month [September 2021], the British scientists cautioned that their study was too small to detect rare problems.)

The mix-and-match option could offer lifesaving flexibility in a world where COVID-19 vaccines remain in desperately short supply. If supplies were to run out before people got a 2nd dose, they could switch to another vaccine and still get a strong immunity to the coronavirus.

Vaccines against some diseases require more than 2 shots in a so-called primary series to reach the highest possible protection. In other cases, an additional booster shot, after the primary series, is needed to restore flagging immunity.

Over the summer [2021], both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines began showing some loss of effectiveness against infection, although they both remained strong against hospitalization. Nevertheless, the Biden administration began a push for boosters to restore people's immune responses.

Pfizer and BioNTech ran trials of boosters of their vaccine, while Moderna ran its own studies. Last month [September 2021], the FDA authorized a Pfizer-BioNTech booster for certain groups of people who received 2 doses earlier this year [2021]. It is expected to do the same for Moderna this week.

Johnson & Johnson decided to use a single dose for its vaccine, which proved to be less effective in clinical trials than Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech. A study published last month [September 2021] found that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was 71% effective against hospitalization, compared with 88% for Pfizer-BioNTech and 93% for Moderna.

On Friday [15 Oct 2021], the FDA advisers voted in favor of authorizing a 2nd dose of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine as a booster, to strengthen immunity in Americans who had received the 1st dose. But Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccine regulator, said at the meeting that it was possible the agency would not require people to take the same vaccine as a booster.

The agency is considering adjusting the language on the labels for all 3 authorized vaccines to indicate that providers can administer a different authorized vaccine at their discretion.

[2] Ivermectin: consequences of misuse
Date: Wed 19 Oct 2021

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ivermectin is an oral anti-infective medicine that is integral to neglected tropical disease programmes. It is safe and effective for the treatment and control of lymphatic filariasis, scabies, and onchocerciasis, sometimes as part of a mass drug administration, as recognised in the WHO road map for neglected tropical diseases 2021-2030. The WHO essential medicines list provides recommendations for minimum medicine needs for a basic healthcare system, which includes ivermectin as an anthelmintic, antifilarial, and antiectoparasitic treatment.

There has been a groundswell of opinion across several countries that ivermectin might be useful in reducing the symptoms of and mortality due to COVID-19, with many citing meta-analyses that infer positive effects; however, these conclusions appear to be unreliable. On 31 Mar 2021, WHO advised that ivermectin should only be used within clinical trials and not as part of routine clinical practice. This advice was followed by the manufacturer, Merck, that stated on 4 Feb 2021, that there is "no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or clinical efficacy in patients with COVID-19 disease." Despite this, ivermectin is being routinely used in some Latin American settings amid recommendations from some governments and health professionals.

In July 2021, a number of scientists reviewed and reported detailed clinical trial data for use of ivermectin for COVID-19. Their commentaries, which were not peer-reviewed, highlighted extensive inconsistencies within the trial data. They also found that the ivermectin trials with inconsistent data were pivotal to the positive conclusions in peer-reviewed meta-analyses. A July 2021 Cochrane Review assessed the evidence base for ivermectin use in prevention of COVID-19, and treatment of individuals in inpatient and outpatient settings. Their conclusion was one of uncertainty, highlighting that the included studies were small, with few considered to be of high quality.

As the global health community works to control the COVID-19 pandemic, is the future use and reputation of ivermectin at risk? Papua New Guinea and Togo are among countries that implemented mass drug administration using ivermectin during the last quarter of 2021. Amid the COVID-19 controversies, this drug might be viewed with distrust by communities, and with available supplies being diverted elsewhere for use against COVID-19, neglected tropical disease programmes might be compromised. Few of the voices currently advocating for use of ivermectin as a COVID-19 response are likely to be long-term advocates for its use in addressing the burden of scabies or filariasis.

Sustained campaigns of misinformation can affect trust and affect public health and population behaviour. As reported in preprint data, the inconsistent political and regulatory handling of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, ChdAdOx1 nCoV-19, in Europe and North America has been a contributor to vaccine hesitancy in Ghana, and anecdotally, similar situations have been observed in Ethiopia and Papua New Guinea (Yirgu R, Middleton J, Pomat W, unpublished data). Ivermectin itself has been the subject of a widely reproduced but unsubstantiated link to mortality in older people in care homes that still deters clinical use in some settings (including the UK).

Sustained misinformation can lead to diversion of limited healthcare and government resources to addressing rumours rather than making genuine public heath progress. Proactive health promotion and education is needed right now to ensure that locally trusted actors and communicators (including, but not limited to, healthcare workers) are aware of the uncertainty around the ivermectin evidence base for managing COVID-19, and that it remains a vital medicine for managing neglected tropical disease. Where advocacy emerged from official or high-level sources during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have concerns that the likelihood of mistrust within communities will increase. International and national global health policy stakeholders must be made aware that this mistrust could be an issue that needs addressing in both the short-term and medium-term future.

To meet the ambitious 2030 targets of the WHO neglected tropical disease roadmap, reducing stigma around neglected tropical diseases and prevalence of misinformation will be important. In lower-income settings, organisations have spent years building trust between health services and their populations to ensure high acceptance and uptake of population health campaigns. If that trust is eroded because of negative local perceptions around the use of ivermectin, then achievement of national and global neglected tropical disease targets might be hindered, and ultimately vulnerable populations would suffer.

[COVID-19 has generated a lot of collateral damage through neglect of other endemic serious diseases and diversion of some drugs from where they are most needed. Ivermectin is a very effective drug against lymphatic filariasis, scabies, and onchocerciasis. But unreliable results and irresponsible individuals have led COVID patients to demand they be treated with ivermectin. This is a dangerous and wasteful situation. The problem is similar to the vaccine skeptics who use misinformation to sway the public. The COVID-19 pandemic has been riddled with misinformation. - Mod.LK

[3] NIH clinical trial: interferon
Date: Mon 18 Oct 2021

A clinical trial has found that treatment with the immunomodulator interferon beta-1a plus the antiviral remdesivir was not superior to treatment with remdesivir alone in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 pneumonia. In addition, in a subgroup of patients who required high-flow oxygen, investigators found that interferon beta-1a was associated with more adverse events and worse outcomes. These findings were published today [18 Oct 2021] in the journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanres/PIIS2213-2600(21)00384-2.pdf).

The study, called the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial 3 (ACTT-3), took place from 5 Aug 2020 to 21 Dec 2020. It was sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Interferon beta-1a has the same amino acid sequence as a naturally occurring protein called interferon beta, which is in a class of proteins called type 1 interferons. Infected cells normally produce type 1 interferons to help the immune system fight pathogens, especially viruses. Interferon beta has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties.

Laboratory studies have shown that the normal type 1 interferon response is suppressed after infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In addition, previous studies of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated reduced production of interferon in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in many patients, and this was associated with more severe disease. Other laboratory studies and clinical data supported the hypothesis that treatment with interferon beta-1a might improve health outcomes in people with COVID-19.

Ultimately, however, the ACTT-3 investigators found that interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir was not associated with a clinical benefit compared to remdesivir alone in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. The primary outcome, time to recovery, was the same -- a median of 5 days -- for participants receiving interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir as for those receiving remdesivir alone. The likelihood of clinical improvement at day 15 also was similar for participants in the 2 treatment groups.

Remdesivir was used as an active control in this study because the 1st iteration of the ACTT trials found that the antiviral was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery in adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

The ACTT-3 study team enrolled 969 adults at 63 sites in the United States, Japan, Mexico, Singapore and South Korea. Sixty percent of the patients were White, 17% were Black, 9% were Asian, 1% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, and 32% were Hispanic or Latino. Participants were assigned at random in a 1-to-1 ratio to receive either interferon beta-1a plus remdesivir or a placebo plus remdesivir. Neither participants nor the study team knew who was receiving which treatment regimen until the end of the trial.

Subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is a multiple sclerosis medication manufactured and marketed in the United States under the brand name Rebif by EMD Serono Inc., the biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Remdesivir, also known as Veklury, is manufactured by Gilead Sciences, Inc., of Foster City, California.

Weekly epidemiological update on COVID-19 - 19 Oct 2021
--------------------------------------------------------
In this edition:
- Global overview
- Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and variants of concern
- WHO regional overviews
- Summary of the weekly operational update

Summary
------
Globally, the numbers of weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths have stabilized this week, with over 2.7 million cases and over 46 000 new deaths, a 4% and 2% decrease, respectively, representing similar numbers as those reported last week. With the exception of the European region, which for the 3rd consecutive week reported an increase in new COVID-19 cases (7% increase as compared with the previous week), all the other regions reported a decline. The largest decrease in new weekly cases was reported from the African region (18%), followed by the Western Pacific region (17%). The cumulative number of confirmed cases reported globally is now over 240 million, and the cumulative number of deaths is over 4.8 million.

The number of new weekly deaths reported globally also showed a stabilization (2% decrease as compared with the previous week), with similar numbers as those reported last week in the European region (4% increase), Western Pacific region (1% increase) and the American region (1% decrease). The largest decline in new weekly deaths was reported from the African region, showing a 24% decrease as compared to the previous week.

In this edition, we provide updates on the evolution and geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), and summarise phenotypic characteristics (transmissibility, disease severity, risk of reinfection, and impacts on diagnostics and vaccine performance) of VOCs based on published studies.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of interest and variants of concern
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions, and researchers, routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 alter transmission or disease characteristics, or impact effectiveness of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, or public health and social measures (PHSM) applied by national authorities to control disease spread. "Signals" of potential variants of concern (VOCs) or variants of interest (VOIs) are detected and assessed based on the risk posed to global public health. As evidence becomes available, classification for VOIs or VOCs will be revised to reflect the continuous evolution of circulating variants and their changing epidemiology. Criteria for variant classification and the current lists of VOCs, VOIs, and other variants under monitoring (VUMs) are available on the WHO Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants website. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern and are encouraged to investigate and report on impacts of these variants.

Geographic spread and prevalence of VOCs: The current global genetic epidemiology is characterized by a predominance of delta variant, with declining prevalence of other variants among SARS-CoV-2 sequences submitted to publicly available datasets (Figure 4 [see source URL for all figures, tables, and supplementary material]). Given its higher transmissibility, delta has outcompeted other variants, including other VOCs, in many countries. Important sub-regional and country-level variation, nevertheless, continues to be observed, most notably within some South American countries, where the progression of the delta variant has been more gradual than that observed in other regions, and other variants (e.g., gamma, mu) still contribute a large proportion of sequences samples. To better reflect recent changes and the current geographic distribution of VOCs at a global level, we present here a revised set of global maps overlaying recent estimates of VOC prevalence, with data previously presented on detection of VOC reported officially or unofficially to WHO (Figure 5).

Country-specific prevalence estimates were calculated as a proportion of total SARS-CoV-2 sequences uploaded to GISAID with a specimen collection date within the past 60 days, summarised into 3 groups to illustrate locations where the prevalence of VOCs is currently: dominant (greater than 50% prevalence), moderate (11-50% prevalence), or low (10% or less). To ensure robustness of estimates, proportion estimates were limited to countries with 100 or more sequences uploaded during the reporting period.

For countries with fewer than 100 sequences submitted, data on the detection or absence of submitted VOCs sequences as well as previous reports of VOC detection are shown and are detailed in Annex 2. Overall, these maps further highlight that in recent months, delta is the most prevalent variant with widespread global circulation. Other VOCs and other variants are still circulating in some countries, however, largely at low levels. Global VOCs distribution should be interpreted with due consideration of surveillance limitations, including differences in sequencing capacities, sampling strategies between countries, and delays in reporting. Current efforts are underway to strengthen genomic surveillance for SARS-CoV-2, including variants, in several regions and countries to enhance coverage of sequencing and detection of variants globally.

Phenotypic characteristics: Available evidence on the phenotypic impacts of VOCs is summarized in Table 2, as well as in previous editions of the COVID-19 Weekly Epidemiological Updates. Since the last detailed update on 5 Oct 2021, there are several new publications on the phenotypic characteristics of VOCs. A prospective study, not yet peer reviewed, assessed the illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (28 days or more) illness among 1400 symptomatic school-aged children in 2 groups (younger children aged 5-11 years and older children aged 12-17 years) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.

The study was conducted in the United Kingdom at a time when either alpha (28 Dec 2020 to 6 May 2021) or delta (26 May to 8 Jul 2021) were the predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant. Findings from the study suggested that disease in school-aged children due to delta variant resembles illness due to the alpha variant, with short duration and similar symptom burden. Median illness duration was short with either variant: 5 days (IQR 2-9.75) with alpha, and 5 days (IQR 2-9) with delta. The median symptom burden (number of symptoms) over the entire period of illness (28 days) was slightly greater among children infected with delta compared to alpha infection [in younger children, 3 (IQR 2-5) with alpha, 4 (IQR 2-7) with delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3-8) with alpha, and 6 (IQR 3-9) with delta infection].

The 7 most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants and included headache, fatigue, fever, dysosmia (disordered smell perception), sneezing, rhinorrhoea, and sore throat, suggesting no meaningful clinical differences in the disease presentation with either variant. Only a small number of children infected with either variant presented to the hospital, and the presence of long (28 days or more) illness was reported to be low. Findings in another pre-print study conducted in Indonesia, among adults, evaluated the impact of delta variant vs non-delta variant infections on the outcomes of COVID-19 patients.

The study included 69 cases with confirmed isolation of the delta variant compared with 92 cases of non-delta variant. Analysis of associated individual variables showed no significant differences in hospitalization or mortality between patients with delta and non-delta variant infections (p = 0.80 and 0.29, respectively). Additionally, multivariate analysis suggested that age 65 years or older (OR 11.5; 95% CI 1.3-102.6; p = 0.028), obesity (OR 16.6; 95% CI 2.5-107.1; p = 0.003), diabetes (OR 5.5; 95% CI 1.3-23.7; p = 0.021), and hypertension OR 5.8; 95% CI 1.02-32.8; p = 0.047) were prognostic factors for mortality in both groups. Conversely, no prognostic factors were found to be associated with the hospitalization of COVID-19 patients.

A peer-reviewed retrospective study conducted in Ireland analysed the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, and the impact of alpha variant on neonatal clinical outcomes. The study included all liveborn neonates from mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at any time during pregnancy and up to 24 hours post-partum. This included 133 neonates who were delivered between 1 Mar 2020 and 1 Mar 2021, of which 66 (49.6%) were born following maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection after 1 Jan 2021, corresponding to a time when alpha was the dominant variant in circulation in Ireland.

The findings suggested no increase in the incidence of preterm birth or neonatal intensive care unit admission when compared with 5-year, pre-pandemic hospital data. Maternal infection before and after alpha variant circulation or maternal symptom status also did not influence neonatal outcomes. While this is a reassuring initial finding, further studies to evaluate the impact of VOC infections during pregnancy, particularly the delta variant, are required.

Since the 5 Oct [2021] update, 4 notable new studies have provided evidence of COVID-19 vaccine performance after full vaccination against VOCs. A test-negative case control study from the USA (not yet peer reviewed) evaluated the effectiveness of Moderna-mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 infection among members (4.6 million) of a large healthcare system in Southern California aged 18 years and older. A total of 8153 cases were included in the study, and 5 controls were matched to each case.

Vaccination with Moderna-mRNA-1273 was found to be highly effective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection due to delta 14-60 days post 2nd dose (VE: 94.1%, 95% CI: 60.5-96.3), but declined to 80.0% (95% CI: 70.2-86.6%) at 151-180 days post 2nd dose. VE against infection due to non-delta variants showed a similar pattern with a VE against infection 14-60 days post 2nd dose of 98.6% (97.3-99.3%), which reduced to 88.7% (73.2-95.2%) at 121-150 days. VE against hospitalization due to delta over the entire study period (greater than or equal to 14 days post 2nd dose) was 97.6% (92.8-99.2%). VE estimates against infection over the entire study period (greater than or equal to 14 days post 2nd dose) were 98.4% (96.9-99.1%), 95.5% (90.9-97.8%), and 90.4% (73.9-96.5%) for alpha, gamma, and mu variants, respectively.

A 2nd study from Canada (not yet peer-reviewed) provided updated results from a previous version of the preprint. The study evaluated VE of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty, Moderna-mRNA-1273, and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccines against symptomatic disease and against hospitalization or death due to alpha, beta, gamma, and delta VOCs. All vaccines were highly effective at preventing both symptomatic disease as well as hospitalization or death 14 or more days post final vaccination (2 doses). VE against symptomatic disease was greater than or equal to 86% for each vaccine and against each VOC. VE against hospitalization or death was greater than or equal to 92% for each vaccine against each VOC. These estimates include a follow-up time post full vaccination of up to 28 weeks, 25 weeks, and 3 weeks for Pfizer BioNTechComirnaty, Moderna-mRNA-1273, and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria vaccines, respectively. Of note, VE of AstraZenecaVaxzevria against hospitalization or death due to beta was not reported; several VE estimates were approximated to be 100% but could not be reliably assessed due to no cases in the vaccinated group.

A 3rd peer-reviewed study from Spain assessed the effectiveness of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty, Moderna-mRNA1273, AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria, and Janssen-Ad26.COV 2.S vaccines in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection due to alpha and delta variants based on the vaccine status of close contacts of index cases. Moderna-mRNA-1273, JanssenAd26.COV 2.S, Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty, and AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria were found to be 86% (56-95%), 77% (27-93%), 71% (61-78%), and 38% (-42-73%) effective at preventing infection among close contacts due to alpha 14 or more days post final dose, respectively, with follow-up time since complete vaccination up to 28, 23, 31, and 16 weeks for each of the vaccines, respectively. VE against infection due to delta was similar to alpha for the mRNA vaccines [67% (59-74%) for Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty, 77% (63-85%) for Moderna-mRNA-1273].

However, VE against delta infection was lower for Janssen-Ad26.COV 2.S at 42% (18-59%) than that against alpha, although with very wide confidence intervals for both VE estimates. The VE of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria against delta was 55% (39-67%); comparison to that of alpha is hindered due to the very small numbers with alpha infection. This study also evaluated the VE of one dose of AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria followed by a 2nd dose of Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccine against infection due to delta. VE of this heterologous regimen against delta infection 14 or more days post 2nd dose was 86% (45-97%), with a follow-up time up to 21 weeks post full vaccination.

The rate of severe disease among individuals 60 years and older was 18.7-fold (95% CI 15.7-22.4) lower in the group who received a booster dose, as compared to the group who did not receive a booster dose, and among individuals 40-59 years old, was 22-fold (95% CI 10.3-47) lower. Among persons 60 years and older, the rate of death was lower in the group who received a booster dose by a factor of 14.7 (9.4-23.1) compared to the group who did not receive a booster dose. Follow-up time post-booster ranged from 3.5 weeks for individuals 16-29 years to 8 weeks for persons 60 years and older.

WHO, with support of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and its COVID-19 Vaccines Working Group, continues to review the emerging evidence on the need for and timing of a booster dose for the currently available COVID-19 vaccines that have received Emergency Use Listing (EUL). As concluded in the Interim Statement released 4 Oct 2021, introducing booster doses should be firmly evidence-driven and targeted to the population groups in greatest need. The rationale for implementing booster doses should be guided by evidence on waning vaccine effectiveness, in particular a decline in protection against severe disease in the general population and in high-risk populations, or due to a circulating VOC.

To date, the evidence remains limited and still inconclusive on any widespread need for booster doses following a primary vaccination series. In the context of ongoing global vaccine supply constraints, broad-based administration of booster doses risks exacerbating inequities in vaccine access by driving up demand and diverting supply while priority populations in some countries, or in subnational settings, have not yet received a primary vaccination series. Focus remains on urgently increasing global vaccination coverage with the primary series driven by the objective to protect against severe disease.

[In the past 24 hours, 9 countries including the USA (71 809), UK (43 324), Russia (33 740), Turkey (30 862), Romania (18 863), Ukraine (15 579), India (14 936), Iran (13 308), Brazil (12 969), and Germany (10 543) have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 8434 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 17 Oct 2021 to late 18 Oct 2021). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 30 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 4 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 3.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 8.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 17.4% decrease in daily reported cases and 20.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported approximately 450 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 242.32 million cumulative reported cases and over 4.92 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
