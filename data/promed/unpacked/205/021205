Over 15 000 domestic pigs have died from African swine fever [ASF] since its 1st outbreak in Nepal in March this year [2022].

Officials at the Department of Livestock Services under the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development said the highly contagious disease has spread to several districts across the country and inflicted huge losses to farmers.

"Infection of the African swine fever virus still continues," said Barun Kumar Sharma, deputy director general at the department. "As there is no medication available against the deadly virus, we can just ask farmers not to transport sick pigs from one place to another."

The outbreak has been reported in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Kavrepalanchok, Chitwan, Sunsari, Jhapa, Morang, Bardia, Dang, and Kaski districts.

According to studies, ASF is a highly contagious viral pig disease, transmitted through direct contact with infected pigs, wild boars, and ticks. The virus can also survive for several months in processed meat and several years in frozen carcasses.

The World Organization for Animal Health [WOAH] said that the virus is "not a danger" to human health, but it could have a devastating impact on the pig population.

Pigs are one of the key sources of food in Nepal.

There is currently no effective vaccine against African swine fever.

"The virus is highly contagious. It can have up to 100 percent mortality rate in pigs," Dr Dibesh Karmacharya, chairman at the Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal and Biovac Nepal.

The WOAH said that human behaviours can play an important role in spreading this pig disease across borders if adequate measures are not taken.

ASF could inflict heavy damage to the farm sector. "Each pig cost thousands of rupees, and thousands died of the virus infection already," said Karmacharya. "Authorities concerned should announce schemes to provide relief to affected farmers."

African swine fever continues to spread worldwide.

The disease has reached multiple countries across Asia, including China and India, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Pacific, affecting both domestic and wild pigs.
