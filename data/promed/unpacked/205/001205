"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a fatal disease in rabbits and is classified as a foreign animal disease in the United States. In February 2020, animal health officials detected rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 2 (RHDV2) for the 3rd time in the United States, since 2018. Since that detection, RHDV2 has spread to multiple states across the Southwest. RHDV2 does not impact human health" (Source: USDA rabbit hemorrhagic disease factsheet (June 2020) https://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/fs-rhdv2.pdf).
