Soul Cedar Farm of Quilcene, WA, is recalling all batches of Zesty Sweet Peppers because of potential contamination from _Clostridium botulinum_ toxins. The recall was initiated after routine sampling conducted by the Washington State Department of Agriculture revealed that one batch of Zesty Sweet Peppers had a pH level high enough to support the formation of the _Clostridium botulinum_ toxin, which causes botulism poisoning.

The recalled product was packaged in 8-ounce glass containers and was sold at retail stores in Quilcene and Port Townsend, WA. Consumers who have purchased the Zesty Sweet Peppers are urged not to consume the product and return it to the place of purchase for a full refund.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
