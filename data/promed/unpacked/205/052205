2003/013 EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of
regulated pests)
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance (as
they are now called by FAO ISPM no. 13) for 2002 received since the
previous report (EPPO RS 2002/154) from the following countries: Austria,
Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia,
Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain,
and Sweden.
When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*). The EPPO Secretariat has
selected notifications of non-compliance made because of the detection of
regulated pests. Other notifications of non-compliance due to prohibited
commodities, missing or invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be
pointed out that the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have
not yet sent their notifications.
