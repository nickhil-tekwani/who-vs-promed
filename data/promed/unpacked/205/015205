Epidemiological investigation and follow-up on confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H9N2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [31 Dec 2013] provided an update on the confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H9N2) affecting a man aged 86. "The epidemiological investigations, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are all ongoing," a spokesman for the DH said. The patient's home contact in Shenzhen [Guangdong province] has remained asymptomatic.

The 51 health-care workers (HCWs) of North District Hospital (NDH) and the ambulance service remain under medical surveillance. Among them, an HCW of NDH presented with productive cough and sore throat and the respiratory specimen tested negative for the influenza A virus upon testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch (PHLSB). The officer who handled the patient upon his entry at Lo Wu Border Control Point is also asymptomatic. He has been put under medical surveillance. So far, there are no newly located contacts.

As the patient was staying in Shenzhen for the whole incubation period, the case is classified as an imported one. The CHP has passed investigation findings to the health authority of Guangdong [province] for follow-up. "Upon analysis by the PHLSB, the genes of the virus were determined to be of avian origin. They do not show significant differences from avian influenza viruses detected in Hong Kong and the Mainland in recent years. There is no evidence of genetic reassortment with genes of human influenza origin or resistance to the antiviral Tamiflu. We will continue to liaise and share the gene sequence with other health authorities based on established arrangements," the spokesman remarked.

The public is advised to avoid contact with poultry and wild birds, including chickens, ducks and sparrows. "Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas and provinces," the spokesman advised.

Members of the public should remain vigilant and take heed of the preventive advice against avian influenza below:
- Do not visit live poultry markets. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings. If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients.

[This investigation confirms that the avian influenza H9N2 infection was contracted by the patient at his own residence in Shenzhen, Guangdong province in China, and not after entry into Hong Kong. Genetic analysis has revealed that the virus is not a reassortant and all the genome sub-units have avian-like characteristics. There is no evidence of transmission of the virus to other human patients or contacts. All the evidence indicates that the H9N2 is an avian virus and no direct danger to the human population. - Mod.CP
