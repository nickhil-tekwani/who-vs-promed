Malaria Outbreak Forces S. Africa to Return to DDT
------------------------------------------------------------
JOZINI, South Africa: Malaria was pretty much under control in
KwaZulu-Natal province 5 years ago, so health officials thought it was safe
to stop using DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), the notorious
insecticide banned in most of the developed world. Almost immediately,
this semitropical region along the Indian Ocean saw a dramatic increase in
the number of cases of malaria, which is transmitted by mosquitoes. There
are now nearly 10 times as many cases as in 1995. There were no malaria
deaths 5 years ago. This year, the disease has killed more than 300 people
in the province.
Health officials said they had no choice but to go back to DDT, even though
the pesticide is widely blamed for environmental damage and is suspected of
posing a health hazard. South Africa's experience with DDT was a main
reason the pesticide received a reprieve under an international treaty
negotiated this month to ban 12 toxic chemicals.
The treaty, scheduled to take effect in about 5 years, would immediately
ban the production of 9 of the "dirty dozen" chemicals that biodegrade
slowly and have been linked to cancer, birth defects and other
disorders. They include chlordane, dieldrin and hexachlorobenzene.
But DDT, whose perils were the subject of Rachel Carson's 1962 book,
"Silent Spring," which catalyzed the modern environmental movement, was
regarded as too useful in the fight against malaria to ban outright.
About 25 countries, including South Africa, would be allowed to use DDT
under strict controls until a safer solution is found. DDT is produced
only in Mexico, India and China.
DDT's image has metamorphosed since health officials began raising alarms
about a worldwide resurgence in malaria, which kills more people than any
communicable disease except tuberculosis. The World Health Organization
estimates that between 300 million and 500 million people are afflicted
with malaria each year, and more than a million die, mostly children in
rural Africa.
Although other insecticides are more expensive and less effective, DDT is
unsurpassed as an affordable killer and repellent of mosquitoes.
Health officials in South Africa emphasize that they use DDT judiciously,
only spraying the chemical on residential structures where humans are
vulnerable to mosquitoes at night, when the species that carries the
malaria parasite prefers to feed on warm-blooded creatures.
South Africa, where thousands of tons of DDT were introduced into the
environment by airplane crop-dusters, long ago banned agricultural use of
the compound.
In the United States, such campaigns to eradicate insects led to the near
extermination of several species of birds of prey, including the bald eagle
and the peregrine falcon. The chemical became so pervasive that it was
found in the breast milk of nursing mothers.
Last week, one of the provincial health department crews moved from house
to house in a steamy, rural area on the coastal plain near Mozambique,
where several malaria cases were recently reported. The work crews,
wearing blue overalls and protective paper masks, applied the
sweet-smelling aerosol from hand-pumped tanks on the mud-and-stick walls
and grass roofs of the traditional Zulu dwellings. The crews apply about 2
grams of pesticide per square yard, which leaves a light white coating. It
is effective for up to a year.
When health officials stopped using DDT in 1995, they switched to a
biodegradable pyrethroid, a synthetic insecticide based on the pyrethrum
flower.
Last year, health officials noted that malaria cases failed to decline in
June during the onset of the southern hemisphere winter.
Then entomologists in KwaZulu identified the _Anopheles funestus_ mosquito,
a species adept at carrying malaria parasites, and which had been
eradicated in South Africa in the 1950s. It was resistant to pyrethroids.

[It has been recognized for decades that the very stable DDT accumulated
through the food chain, and could be found in breast milk. There is little
doubt that the majority of DDT was used in agriculture, and it is good news
for poor countries that supplies will still be available for malaria
control. The advantage of DDT is its long residual activity when applied
to walls of houses, killing resting mosquitoes for up to 6 months.
Pyrethroids are mentioned in the post, and are alternatives, but even
synthetic pyrethroids are effective for much shorter periods and are more
expensive. An alternative to residual spraying with DDT is the use of
impregnated bed nets which has proven very effective even when impregnated
at 12 months interval. - Mod.EP
