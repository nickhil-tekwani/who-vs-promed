Area's 6th measles case
-----------------------
A 6th case of measles has been reported in the Washington area, this time
in Prince William County, the 1st sign of the disease in Virginia this year
[2009]. The Virginia Department of Health announced the case yesterday [21
Apr 2009], a day after DC [District of Columbia] officials reported finding
the highly infectious disease in a District man who contracted it during a
recent 3 week trip to India. There is no known link between the Virginia
case and the others in the region, health officials said. The source of the
measles virus in the Virginia resident has not been identified.

Denise Sockwell, the Virginia Department of Health's epidemiologist for
Northern Virginia, said the man "did not have a history of travel outside
the United States." The Prince William resident works at the Harris Teeter
in Tysons Corner, said Jennifer Thompson, director of communications for
the supermarket chain. "The person is fine now," Thompson said, adding that
the store sent voice mail messages yesterday [21 Apr 2009] to 1074
customers who had shopped at the store during the man's shifts 10-14 Apr
2009, alerting them to possible exposure. She said no other employees have
contracted the disease, and the man has not returned to work.

The man also visited several places [restaurants and stores] where
unimmunized people might have been exposed, including a Safeway and
7-Eleven in Woodbridge, an IHOP in Falls Church, and a CVS in Fairfax
Station. People who think they might have measles should contact their
doctor's offices before going in, Sockwell said, so that precautions can be
taken to prevent others from being exposed.

Measles germs can linger in the air [that is, in the environment - Mod.CP]
for up to 2 hours, putting at risk people who have not been vaccinated. In
the United States, that includes babies under one year old who are too
young for the vaccine, people who have moved to the region from countries
where the vaccine is not prevalent, and people who decide against getting
it for religious or other reasons.

People born before 1957, when the vaccine was not available, are generally
considered to be immune because they are assumed to have contracted the
disease as children, health officials said. "In those days, it was thought
of as a disease of childhood," Sockwell said. According to the 2007
Virginia Immunization Survey, 94 per cent of kindergarteners and 98 per
cent of 6th graders in Virginia are vaccinated, she said.

The virus spreads through coughing and sneezing. Most people fully recover,
but it can lead to complications such as ear infections, pneumonia, and
death. Symptoms include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose, and red,
watery eyes, which can start 7 to 21 days after exposure and last about a week.

Six cases in a region in a short period is rare, Sockwell said, noting that
before one reported case last year [2008], the state had not had a case in
6 years.

[As no link between the Virginia case and the imported case in the DC area
where the other 4 cases have been identified, it must be assumed that there
are now at least 3 separate foci of infection in the Washington area.
Further information on the origin of these foci as it becomes available
would be welcomed.
