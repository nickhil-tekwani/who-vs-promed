A 47-year-old woman is hospitalized in critical condition due to botulism at Villa Dolores Regional Hospital; symptoms...began after consuming canned food. The products were made by "A [Pleno]" brand from Villa Las Rosas, Córdoba.

Doctor Juan Uez, director of the Regional Hospital of Villa Dolores, said the patient's condition is "very critical" with bilateral pneumonia and requiring mechanical ventilation: "It is impossible to transfer the patient as her condition is very critical," the doctor said in a statement to local media.

Gonzalo Largi, Director of Food Science, Villa Dolores, said that "the product the woman ate was expired" and it was bought in a store in that city. Regarding the production process of the "A [Pleno]" brand, the official explained that they are made by a resident of Villa Las Rosas (about 14 kilometers [8.7 mi] from Villa Dolores) and that she sells 3 types of food: sunflower paneer, chana [chickpea] paste and peanut paste.

IA National Administration of Drugs, Food and Medical Technology issued an alert recommending that the population refrain from consuming all products of the "A [Pleno]" brand. If they have done so and if they present early symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blurred vision, double vision, dry mouth, difficulty speaking and swallowing, they should consult a doctor immediately. In addition, the National Regulatory Agency indicated that stores that have products of that brand for sale should take them off the shelves.

[Even if the food was "expired" (past the "use by" date), there may also have been issues with how it was stored.

Although the neurological symptoms of botulism with cranial nerve findings and flaccid paralysis, which can culminate in respiratory failure, can be mimicked by other diseases, a cluster of such cases is almost always due to intoxication with one of the types of botulinum toxin. While the botulinum spores can survive in boiling water, the botulinum toxin is heat-labile. Heating food to a typical cooking temperature of 80 deg C (176 deg F) for 10 minutes before consumption can greatly reduce the risk of illness.

Botulism, or sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was first seriously studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. (See Botulism in Alaska, November 2017, Alaska Department of Health and Social Services at https://dec.alaska.gov/media/23924/resources-botulism-in-alaska-2017-update.pdf. - Mod.ML). The outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as "botulism" after "botulus," the Latin word for sausage.

Córdoba is a city in central Argentina, about 700 km (435 mi) northwest of Buenos Aires. It is the capital of Córdoba Province and the 2nd most populous city in Argentina after Buenos Aires. - Mod.LL
