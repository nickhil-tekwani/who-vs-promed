Blue Tongue modification of the regulated zone for BTV-1 and BTV-8
------------------------------------------------------------------
Following the positive result for BTV serotype 1 in the Department of
Allier, a modification of the continental zonage has been established,
as of Thu 3 Sep 2009.

The farm is located at Sorbier (1 bovine) and was discovered during
the surveillance of a sentinel herd. 59 farms have been declared (as
positive for Blue Tongue) in 2009, coming from the viral circulation
in 2009. These are:
- 4 farms with BTV serotype 1
- 3 farms with BTV serotypes 1 and 8
- 52 farms with BTV serotype 8

The actual list of regulated communes will be sent (to interested
parties) by mail. These will only show the communes in the regulated
zones.

A list of the communes situated less than 20 kms from the farms with
the Blue Tongue virus will also be sent by mail.
