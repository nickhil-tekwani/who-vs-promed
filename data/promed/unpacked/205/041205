Rinderpest in Mauritania: serological findings in warthogs
----------------------------------------------------------
Translation of information reported and received on 17 Jul 2003 from Dr
Mokhtar Fall, deputy director, Department of Animal Production and
Agriculture, Ministry of Rural Development and Environment, Nouakchott.
Within the framework of epidemiological surveillance for rinderpest in
wildlife, undertaken with the support of the Pan African Programme for the
Control of Epizootics (PACE), 32 serum samples were collected from legally
hunted warthogs in January 2003, in the region of the Senegal River, not
far from the Diama dam.
Location: localities of Guere and N'Khaila, Keur Macen Department, Trarza
region, 200 km south of Nouakchott, along the Senegal River and on the
border with Senegal.
Description of affected population: population of warthogs (total number
unknown) grazing on the same land as cattle.
Diagnosis:
Tests were conducted at the National Animal Production and Veterinary
Research Centre (CNERV, Centre National d'Elevage et de Recherches
Veterinaires), Mauritania; Central animal pathology laboratory,
Bingerville, Cote d'Ivoire; and the Senegalese agricultural research
institute (ISRA, Institut Senegalais de Recherches Agricoles), Dakar,
Senegal. The 2 positive sera were sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory in
Pirbright, United Kingdom, for confirmation.
Diagnostic tests used: c-ELISA (competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay): 2 sera positive (percentage inhibition over 90 per cent) and virus
neutralisation test: the same 2 sera were confirmed by seroneutralisation
(dilution rate 640 and 1280, respectively).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: investigations in progress.
B. Other epidemiological details:
- a detailed epidemiological investigation is being conducted in the region.
- to date, no clinical signs have been detected that could lead to a
suspicion of rinderpest.
- implementation of a clinical and serological investigation in bovines
based on the Guide to Epidemiological Surveillance for Rinderpest developed
by the OIE.
- the necessary steps are being taken to obtain administrative
authorisation to conduct investigations in warthogs.
Control measures:
- provisional restriction measures have been implemented.
- surveillance has been stepped up.
- neighbouring countries will be notified of the need for vigilance and on
the measures to be taken.

[The possibility of the presence of rinderpest virus in Mauritanian
wildlife, adjacent to the border with Senegal, is alarming. West Africa has
been regarded as free of rinderpest for a rather long time, and is not
regarded as a "zone at risk" by GREP (FAO's Global Rinderpest Eradication
Programme). According to the data of GREP, the last rinderpest outbreak in
Mauritania was recorded in 1987, and since May 1998 no vaccinations have
been carried out; see
<http://www.fao.org/ag/AGA/AGAH/EMPRES/grep/africa/maurita.htm>.
Mauritania has been included in OIE's list of 27 "Self-declared Countries
Provisionally Free from Rinderpest Disease" (date of self-declaration - May
1999).
The described serological investigation in warthogs has been conducted by
the Mauritanian authorities in line with appendix 3.8.2. ("Recommended
Standards for Epidemiological Surveillance Systems for Rinderpest") of
OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Such surveillance is necessary to
provide evidence that a country or region is free from a disease or
infection. [The neutralization titres are tires are certainly high enough
to be significant. According to Murphy et al, Veterinary Virology (3rd
edition), Acaademic Press, 1999, page 422: "Strains of rinderpest virus
prevalent in eastern Africa are generally mild and there may be no clinical
signs, only seroconversion." Presumably the same is now true of western
Africa. - Mod.CP]
Disease surveillance should be implemented by both:
a) a system of reporting of any signs of disease activity that come to the
notice of livestock owners or veterinarians, and
b) an active programme of examination of statistically selected samples
from host populations in order to detect clinical signs or other
indications of the occurrence of disease or transmission of infection.
Article c) iii of the appendix says: "investigations into infection in wild
susceptible species must be carried out where these species occur in
significant numbers. Where there are opportunities, sampling should be done
when possible.
Additional strategic sampling of domestic stock should be done in areas
adjacent to large game populations to enhance the possibilities of
detecting the presence of virus in the game. The findings must be
consistent with freedom from infection."

The Mauritanian undertaking is commendable; it is important to obtain the
results of similar surveillance activities in other PACE countries. - Mod.AS]
