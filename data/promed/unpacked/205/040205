E. coli O157, cows to humans via rabbits? - UK 20011110.2783

From: Peter English <Peter.English@esha.nhs.uk>
An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 [infection was associated with a "children's
farm" in Surrey, United Kingdom (UK), in 2000. No _E. coli_ (VTEC O157) was
found in pooled fecal samples from rabbits in petting pens, but goats in a
barn nearby were positive.
Samples examined by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Winchester, UK,
yielded the following findings (VTEC O157 only reported):
Cow 1: VTEC O157 culture positive, phage type (PT)4
Cow 2: VTEC O157 culture positive, PT4
Ewe lambs (3) in straw bedded pen, pool of floor feces: untypable _E.coli_
(not O157)
Pool of sheep feces from sheepdog field, ewe lambs x 6: VTEC O157 culture
positive, PT4
Yearling sheep in field with cow 2 x 8 pool floor feces: VTEC O157 culture
positive, PT4
Adult female goat 1 (in barn), floor feces swab: VTEC O157 culture
positive, PT4
Kid (same barn as goat 1): VTEC O157 culture positive, PT4
Pool floor feces (same barn as goat 1): VTEC O157 culture positive, PT 21/28
Floor feces, nanny goat 2: negative
Floor feces, billy goat adjacent to nanny goat 2: negative
Floor feces, pony 1: negative
Floor feces, horse 1: negative
Pool of horse feces (ponies and foal, not the ones above) from sheepdog
field (as above): VTEC O157 culture positive, PT4
Sow 1: negative
Sow 2: negative
Pool floor feces from rabbit pens 2, 3, and 4 (where rabbits could be
petted): negative
Pool floor feces from rabbit pens 5, 6, and 6 (where rabbits could be
petted): negative
Manure heap (mainly straw): negative

[These data do not support the idea that rabbits are a common source of _E.
coli_ O157 in the "children's farm" environment. Systematic surveys such as
this one would be useful as a regular follow-up when outbreaks occur to
develop a more complete understanding of the epidemiology of the disease. -
