More people contract anthrax in Rusape
--------------------------------
A total of 16 more people in Rusape are at the risk of contracting anthrax after consuming infected meat following the outbreak of the hemorrhagic infection in the Masvosva area.

So far 20 cases have been confirmed and 16 others are said to be at risk of the infection according to records at Rusape General Hospital -- bringing nearly to 40 the number of people likely to be affected by the consumption of meat infected by the killer disease.

Outgoing Rusape District Medical Superintendent, Dr Mohammed Khaled, confirmed the findings, but said the situation was under control. "According to the report we got, 16 more people are at risk because they are suspected to have eaten the same meat. The area is still under surveillance because more people could be at risk. To date, 20 cases have been confirmed, and investigations point out that another 16 others are at risk," he said. Humans usually get anthrax through direct contact with infected livestock, often when spores get into a cut on the skin or eating infected meat. Without treatment, anthrax can be fatal, but early treatment with antibiotics is very effective.

Anthrax has killed hundreds of animals mostly in Masvosva, a situation that was worsened by ignorant farmers who concealed information about their animal's deaths to veterinary authorities fearing arrest.

The veterinary authorities in the district only picked the information about the anthrax outbreak following its detection in patients at Masvosva Clinic. It is understood, however, that cattle in the area started dying as early as October [2012], but farmers were not reporting the sporadic deaths for timely vaccine interventions.

The veterinary authorities have since moved to vaccinate the cattle in Masvosva, Dewedzo and other surrounding areas and embargoed the movement of cattle from these areas to avert the spread of the disease to other areas. Makoni District veterinary officer, Dr Kupahwana, urged farmers to cooperate with his officers on the ground, adding that animal sickness was not an offence.

Dr Kupahwana dissuaded farmers from slaughtering sick animals, adding that dead ones must be properly buried to avoid the spread of the disease. Recently anthrax cases were documented in Buhera, Mutare, Mutasa and Chipinge districts.

[Between the delays in getting cattle vaccinated and the epidemic stopping, and the clearance of distributed contaminated beef it will take a while for the human incidences to cease. But with the extent of rural poverty in Zimbabwe we have not seen the last of human cases in that country.
