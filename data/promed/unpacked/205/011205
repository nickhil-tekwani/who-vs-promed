A 64 year old man in South Chungcheong Province [Chungcheongbuk-do] died from a tickborne virus after being hospitalized for a week, putting Korea's health authorities on high alert over the deadly disease. This is the 1st confirmed death this year [2014] from the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), which took the lives of 17 people last year.

According to the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) Monday [12 May 2014], the man was hospitalized on 3 May [2014] after exhibiting symptoms of SFTS, which include vomiting and high fever. He died a week later. His 63 year old wife had also contracted SFTS earlier but fully recovered. She has been released from hospital.

The virus, spread by ticks, causes fever and vomiting, and platelet and white blood cell levels to drop. The virus can also cause multiple organ failure and death.

In 2013, a total of 36 Koreans were infected with the tickborne virus. SFTS was first reported in China in 2009 and in Korea, the 1st case was reported in May last year [2013].

When bitten by ticks, the virus causing SFTS normally undergoes a dormant [incubation] period of 6-14 days. Then, those infected suffer from a high fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. There is no known cure or vaccine for SFTS, the KCDC said, adding that patients must visit hospital immediately and receive treatment aimed at boosting the immune system.

The agency stressed the importance of avoiding tick bites, saying that people should wear long sleeves and boots when engaging in outdoor activities from April to November when ticks are active. It added that disinfectants must be used after rescuing or treating wild animals and clothes must not be taken off where animals are bred or treated.

[Mod.JW commented in a ProMED-mail post dated 26 Feb 2014 (archive no 20140301.2308402), "SFTS virus is a phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family, hence the varying archive subjects listed below. It was first isolated in China from samples from fever patients in 2009, and has since been detected in Japan and South Korea. The vector was found to be ticks.

"The tick that carries the virus in question, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, was discovered in South Korea around 30 years ago," said Oh Myeong-don, a doctor of infectious disease and internal medicine at Seoul National University Hospital. "A lot of research has been conducted into the issue in China. The reason the media was reporting that the mortality rate of the disease was 30 per cent is that at first they were only able to find the most serious cases. But now reports have also been made of people who recovered on their own after being infected, and people who only had mild symptoms, which has brought the mortality rate down to 6 per cent," Oh said. "While there is no reason to be overly concerned about the disease, it is still a good idea to make sure you don't get bitten by ticks." (See ProMED archive Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - Japan, South Korea: update 20130526.1738022)." The SFTS virus is widespread in China in both the human population and domestic animals (especially goats) harboring ticks."
