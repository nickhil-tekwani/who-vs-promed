[1] Cholera - Mozambique (Cabo Delgado province)
Date: Fri 26 Jan 2018

http://allafrica.com/stories/201801260134.html


The number of diagnosed cholera cases in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado has steadily increased over the past week [week of Sun 14 Jan 2018], the National Director of Public Health, Rosa Marlene, told reporters on [Wed 24 Jan 2018]. Last week [week of Sun 14 Jan 2018], the health authorities announced there was an outbreak of cholera in the Cabo Delgado provincial capital, Pemba, and Marlene has admitted that the situation is worsening.

Speaking to the press after an official ceremony to distribute hearing aids to children with hearing disabilities, Marlene said "We would like the
figures to show that the number of cholera cases is dropping, but that's not the trend. Cholera is on the increase because, for example, latrines are not used properly in Cabo Delgado. This increase shows that we are failing".

Marlene said that the cumulative number of cholera cases diagnosed so far was 92. On [Wed 24 Jan 2018], 10 new cases entered Cabo Delgado health units. That is twice as many as entered on [Tue 23 Jan 2018].

Cabo Delgado was one of the northern provinces lashed by severe storms over the past week [week of Sun 14 Jan 2018]. Marlene feared that, if it continues to rain in the province, "the number of cases of cholera and diarrhea will increase".

So far there have been no deaths in the Pemba cholera outbreak. There has also been a rise in other diarrheal diseases. In all cases, the victims are checked to make sure that they are not carrying cholera.

Cholera - United Republic of Tanzania
-------------------------------------
From 15 Aug 2015 through [Sun 7 Jan 2018], 33 421 cases including 542 deaths (case fatality rate = 1.62 percent) have been reported across all 26 regions of the United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar). Tanzania mainland has reported 86 percent of the total cases in this outbreak. Children under 5 years old accounted for 11.4 percent of cases. Since the beginning of the outbreak over 7000 specimens have been tested for cholera and 47 percent were positive for _Vibrio cholerae_ by culture.

From 1 January 2017 through 31 Dec 2017, 4985 cases including 99 deaths have been reported in Tanzania Mainland and Zanzibar. The number of cases as well as geographical spread of cholera has markedly reduced compared to the 2 previous years. During the same period in 2016, 14 547 cases and 225 deaths were reported for Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar. In 2017, the highest number of cases was reported from Mbeya Region during week 31 [week starting Mon 31 Jul 2017] and from Songwe Region during week 43 [week starting Mon 23 Oct 2017]. Between weeks 49-52, Uvinza, Songwe and Nyasa districts reported the highest number of cases.

The resurgence of cases in Kigoma, Manyara, Dodoma, Mbeya and Dar es Salaam regions, and Ruvuma and Rukwa regions reporting cases for the 1st time since the beginning of the outbreak reflects the persisting risk for a cholera upsurge in many other regions. Zanzibar has reported no cases since the last case was reported on [Tue 11 Jul 2017], however high population movement to and from Tanzania Mainland still poses a risk of spread to Zanzibar.

Public health response
----------------------
The following public health measures are currently being implemented:
- The Ministry of Health (MoH) is collaborating with WHO and other partners (UNICEF and the United States Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)) to implement and monitor cholera control activities through the National Task Force.
- On [Fri 15 Dec 2017], the National Cholera Response Plan has been reviewed and validated by the MoH and stakeholders.
- Cholera National Task Force meeting was conducted on [Fri 29 Dec 2017] and agreed to deploy a team to assist Uvinza District to respond to the acute upsurge of cholera cases.
- The MoH deployed a national rapid response team to Ruvuma Region which reported cases for the 1st time at the end of November 2017.
- Community sensitization and awareness through local radio, television and social media is ongoing.
- UNICEF is supporting the promotion and distribution of aqua tabs for household level water treatment and safe storage in the affected households.
- Zanzibar is progressing to develop a 10 year cholera elimination plan.
- Initiation of exchanges for reinforcing the cross-border preparedness and response actions.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Active cholera transmission has persisted in Tanzania Mainland, with Mbeya and Songwe Regions being the most active. The country remains vulnerable to the late detection of cholera due to the weak surveillance systems. The WASH activities, case management, community engagement, and surveillance pillars still require strengthening for optimal outbreak response and, if not addressed, further upsurge of cases may be observed throughout the country. The risk at national level is therefore high.

The closure of the fishing camps along Lake Rukwa on the Songwe Region border, forced the fishermen to move further south to Kyela district which borders Malawi's Karonga district. Malawi recently reported a cholera outbreak in Karonga. Cross-border population movement between the 2 countries might further increase the risk of transmission in Malawi. Other neighbouring countries such as DRC, Burundi, Zambia and Kenya are already experiencing large cholera outbreaks. The risk at regional level is high.

WHO advice
----------
WHO recommends proper and timely case management in Cholera Treatment Centres. Improving access to potable water and sanitation infrastructure, and improved hygiene and food safety practices in affected communities, are the most effective means of controlling cholera. Key public health communication messages should be provided.

WHO advises against any restriction to travel to and trade with Tanzania mainland and Zanzibar based on the information available on the current outbreak.

[4] Cholera - Congo DR (Kinshasa)

The capital city of Kinshasa has registered 725 suspected cases of cholera including 32 deaths, the coordinator of the National Cholera Programme in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has announced. According to Dr. Jos√© Bompange, 26 health zones out of the 35 in Kinshasa are affected by "suspected" cholera, so called because currently they only have biological confirmation from 3 health zones that today constitute the epicenter of the epidemic.

According to him, the density of the city which now has nearly 13 million inhabitants and the conditions in some neighborhoods with sometimes insufficient water supply, explain the resurgence of the epidemic in Kinshasa. The overflow of rainwater also acts as an amplifying factor, he added.

On [Tue 9 Jan 2018], DR Congo's Health Minister estimated that the cholera epidemic could worsen in the coming days in Kinshasa, following recurring floods recently in the city. Meanwhile, WHO handed over to the Congolese government on [Mon 8 Jan 2018] 11 tons of drugs to support the authorities' response against cholera. WHO Regional Director for Africa Ms. Rebecca Matshidiso Moeti, on a working visit to DR Congo, presented the medicines to a representative of the Health minister.

[5] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Mashonaland West province)
Date: Sat 20 Jan 2018

http://www.herald.co.zw/breaking-news-cholera-outbreak-hits-chegutu/


A total of 4 people have died, while 3 others are admitted at Chegutu District Hospital following a cholera outbreak in the town. In an interview yesterday, [Fri 19 Jan 2018], Mashonaland West provincial medical director Dr Wenceslaus Nyamayaro confirmed the outbreak. He said 18 cases involving 11 men and 7 women had been recorded and attended to in the town. Three patients, including one who is in critical condition, are admitted at the district hospital.

Dr Nyamayaro said the disease was discovered after an 80-year-old of Pfupajena Township died on [Mon 8 Jan 2018]. Three other relatives reportedly contracted the deadly disease while performing religious rituals on the body. "Being a Moslem, she had a washout of the intestines, this was carried out by the 3 men aged 47, 71 and 72. These men developed diarrhea and vomiting after 3 days -- 2 of them died and were buried -- and the same rituals were performed without protection."

One of the victims was admitted at Chegutu District Hospital on [Wed 17 Jan 2018] and died a day later [Thu 18 Jan 2018]. Stool samples were sent for investigations and came out positive for the cholera bacterium. However, bodies of the dead had already been released to relatives for burial, exposing more people to the disease.

Authorities have, however, identified poor water supplies in the town as the cause of the outbreak, as some areas are going for 3 to 4 days without water. Residents have resorted to vandalising pipes to access treated water. "There is critical shortage of potable water and there is leakage of sewer pipes. People sometimes go for 3 to 4 days without water," Dr Nyamayaro said.

"People are vandalising underground water pipes and this results in suctioning of sewerage waste into the water system when there is no water." He said control of the outbreak will be difficult without the issue of
reliable water supplies being addressed.

Chegutu suffered its worst cholera outbreak in 2009 when about 200 cases were recorded, leading to the death of at least 30 people.

As Kenyans were enjoying their festivities across the country on Christmas Eve [Sun 24 Dec 2017], a strange disease hit Tigania West constituency. Nobody knew what the disease was, but the symptoms were the same: diarrhea, vomiting, lack of appetite and non-stop abdominal pains. The Meru government was quick to rule out an outbreak of cholera, even as hundreds of villagers were admitted to hospitals. Six people have succumbed to the illness, and 180 others have been admitted to hospital.

What's more, weeks after the disease broke out, more people are reporting the symptoms. Doctors at the neighboring Isiolo Level 5 Hospital have confirmed the disease to be cholera after a patient's results tested positive. A 95-year-old, from Lairang'i village, was the 1st to die, while his son and wife were admitted to an Isiolo hospital with cholera-like symptoms. On [Fri 5 Jan 2018], an 80-year-old, and 2 other villagers died under similar circumstances, bringing the death toll to 6.

In the neighboring county, Tharaka-Nithi, a similar outbreak occurred days later. Health officials were quick to alert the public of cholera moved with speed to contain it.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
