Although hepatitis E virus is, at present, placed in the family
_Caliciviridae_, its genome is substantially different from other members of
this family and this virus eventually may be classified in a separate [new
family.
You might be interested in a summary of a soon to be published study
conducted with 5000 blood donors from the Sacramento Medical Foundation
Blood Center, Sacramento, California. 102 positive tests were identified in
70 individuals. All positive tests were confirmed by CDC using PCR
determinations. Gender: males 38, females 32; Race: White 64, Black 6; Age:
<30 6, 30-49 24, >50 23 [For 17 the ages are missing -- Mod CHC; travel:
HEV endemic area 36, HEV non-endemic area 15, 19 no travel outside the USA.
Dr. Paul Holland MD was the principal investigator and additional

[We will have to await publication (journal?) to see who is in what category
of travel, age-specific attack rates (over all rate 70/5000), etc.
Interesting study, particularly because it was done with a group not usually
amenable to useful analyses. - Mod.CHC
