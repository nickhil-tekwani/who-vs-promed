Summary of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 activity in Europe: 27 Oct - 28 Nov 2020
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 582 detections of HPAI H5 have been reported in Europe between 27 Oct 2020 and 28 Nov 2020. This new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant was originally detected in poultry in Iraq in May 2020 with subsequent detections in Russia and Kazakhstan. It seems likely that migratory waterfowl played a key role in the incursion of this virus into Europe with over 500 detections in wild birds and spillover events into commercial poultry and captive birds.

This situation report provides an overview of the virological, epidemiological, and ornithological characteristics of this new epizootic, which involves H5N8, H5N5 and H5N1 subtypes suggesting local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. We describe the geographical distribution and the variety of avian hosts demonstrating susceptibility to this emerging virus.

The 582 detections of HPAI H5 comprise 35 detections in poultry (6%), 8 in captive birds (1%) and 539 wild bird events (93%). Previous epizootics in Europe have had varied clinical and epidemiological presentations; the 2016/17 H5N8 epizootic affected both wild birds and poultry with over 2800 events recorded between October 2016 and July 2017. The H5N6 epizootic in 2017/18 primarily affected wild birds (80 events) with only 7 events in poultry and captive flocks.

The following section, excerpted from the above-cited report, deserves inclusion:

H5 HPAI (2.3.4.4b of putative African origin for some gene segments) was present in European poultry from 2 Jan 2020 to the last detection on 4 Jun 2020, with H5N8 detected in Eastern Europe with extensive spread within poultry in Hungary (276 events) and Poland (35 events).

There were 6 detections in wild birds of a closely related virus to the poultry-associated H5N8 between Jan and Mar 2020 suggesting a relatively low incidence in wild birds.

Iraq reported H5N8 in poultry in May 2020 with a new H5N8 2.3.4.4b clade variant genetically distinct from the previous 2020 strains in Europe. Genetically similar H5N8 viruses were subsequently detected in southern central Russia, northern Kazakhstan and south-western Russia. In western Europe, HPAI H5 in wild birds was suspected when there was an initial detection in Eurasian wigeons in the Netherlands on 16 Oct 2020 with disease confirmed on 27 Oct with one bird positive for H5N8 and 4 positive for H5N1. The H5N8 virus was similar to that reported in Russia, Kazakhstan and Iraq whilst the H5N1 characterisation suggested local reassortment with wild bird Eurasian avian LPAI genes. Detections in poultry followed with initial H5N8 cases in the Netherlands and the UK submitted to national reference laboratories on 28 Oct and 2 Nov 2020, respectively. Subsequently there has been a substantial increase in cases (principally H5N8) in wild birds particularly in northern Europe and spillover events to commercial poultry and captive birds involving reports from 14 European countries to date [28 Nov 2020].

Nearly all detections of HPAI H5 in wild birds have been found close to coastlines with significant clusters of cases in the Jutland peninsula and within the extensive Wadden Sea -- a continuous intertidal wetland stretching from Denmark to the Netherlands and where many of the Danish, German and Dutch cases occurred. However, wild bird cases also occurred in inland areas in those and other countries, with a 2nd cluster of wild bird detections in the Netherlands.

The lack of detections in other countries in Northern Europe does not imply that HPAIv is absent -- rather that a combination of varied disease prevalence and the sensitivity of wild bird surveillance programmes has inhibited detection thus far.
