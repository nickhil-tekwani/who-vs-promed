[Re the moderator's remark in the said posting] "The EU's decision
to allow both countries the use of an HPAI (highly pathogenic avian
influenza) vaccine in zoos may indicate the availability of a H7N7
vaccine. More information will be appreciated":

The vaccine is not a HPAI vaccine, but a H7 vaccine. A H7 vaccine has
been used in Italy to combat a low-pathogenic H7 outbreak of AI, and
a different one is about to be used in Connecticut for the same
purpose.

[Dr Halvorson's much-appreciated remark justifies an update and
presentation of clarifying data. The vaccine applied in Northern
Italy during the 2000-2002 epizootic caused by an H7N1 HPAI virus was
an inactivated, heterologous subtype HPAI vaccine (strain
A/Chicken/Pakistan/1995-H7N3). The reason for the selection of a
heterologous vaccine was the possibility of using it as a natural
"marker" or a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated
animals). This enabled the EU to approve another AI vaccination
scheme in Northern Italy that has been operational since 31 Dec 2002,
using again a heterologous vaccine, this time an HPAI H7N1 subtype,
to protect against the current H7N3 LPAI field strain (see
20021225.6121 and the 2 references).

The H7N3 vaccine used in Italy in 2000-2002 is one of the 2 vaccines
approved last week by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture for the
vaccination of susceptible animals in zoos (Temporary exemption
decree, published on 22 Apr 2003,
<http://www.minlnv.nl/infomart/persinfo/>).
