[1] Africa (Congo, Kinshasa): hospitals overwhelmed
Date: Sat 12 Jun 2021

Hospitals in Democratic Republic of Congo's capital Kinshasa are "overwhelmed" by a rise in COVID-19 infections, President Felix Tshisekedi said on Sat 12 Jun 2021, as the country was hit by a 3rd wave of the disease.

Like many African countries, Congo has officially registered relatively few cases. But the virus has killed a number of prominent politicians, and low vaccination rates have left the country vulnerable to more contagious variants.

Health officials recorded 254 confirmed COVID-19 cases on Fri [11 Jun 2021], one of the highest daily totals since the pandemic began. In all, Congo has registered 35 000 cases and 830 deaths.

"I am going to take drastic measures to deal with this upsurge of the disease. We're talking about the Indian variant in particular," Tshisekedi told reporters, referring to the Delta variant, which was 1st discovered in India and is highly infectious. He did not specify what measures he planned to take.

Congo delayed its vaccination campaign by more than a month because of concerns about very rare side effects from the AstraZeneca shot. Since the campaign finally started on 19 Apr 2021, fewer than 30 000 doses have been administered.

"You know very well that the AstraZeneca vaccine has been and continues to be problematic, both in terms of side effects but also in terms of trust with the population," Tshisekedi said.

International drug regulators have said the benefits of using vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson outweigh risks as they investigate reports of extremely rare, but potentially fatal blood clots.

Experts say that in Congo, scarce testing means cases and deaths are likely to be heavily understated by official numbers. They also say hospitals are ill-equipped to deal with a fresh wave of the virus.

"There is a big problem with (the supply of) oxygen in Kinshasa," said Pascal Lutumba from the tropical medicine department at the University of Kinshasa.

"In Kinshasa, they don't care about COVID-19; they don't believe in it; that's the big issue," he said, referring to the city's population.

[2] Africa: vaccine
Date: Sat 12 Jun 2021

In Uganda, hospitals have become so overwhelmed with new coronavirus cases that the sick are dying while waiting for a bed. In Namibia, all nonemergency surgery has been canceled to preserve space for Covid-19 patients, and military hospitals have been opened for civilian use. In South Africa's largest city, Johannesburg, intensive-care wards are filling up, and hospitals are stockpiling oxygen cylinders as infections surge again.

Across Africa, which has received fewer Covid-19 vaccines than any other continent, countries are confronting a new wave in coronavirus infections without the inoculations that have turned the tide of the pandemic in Europe and North America.

News that the Group of Seven countries will donate at least one billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to poor countries holds out the promise of some relief on a continent where 0.6% of the 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

However, the donated shots -- most of which won't start to arrive until August 2021 or later -- may not prevent many African governments from running out of shots in the coming weeks as deliveries from the World Health Organization-backed Covax program for developing countries have slowed to a trickle.

Meanwhile, new, more transmissible virus variants are taking root in several African nations, compounding their struggle to rebound from the continent's worst recession on record.

The donated shots will help inoculate the millions of doctors and nurses who work in some of the weakest healthcare systems in the world, often treating Covid-19 patients without the protection their colleagues elsewhere received months ago. Health officials say millions more doses are needed to inoculate the general population and end the pandemic.

"The continent is going through a 3rd wave, no doubt about that," said John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "All countries must arm themselves with treatment facilities. That includes availability of oxygen and other treatment-related commodities."

Case counts are on the rise in 14 of Africa's 54 countries, increasing by 26% in the 1st week of June 2021, compared with the previous 7 days, Dr. Nkengasong said. The epicenters of the new outbreaks are in national capitals, where there often is more capacity to record cases. The situation in towns and villages remains largely uncharted.

Kinshasa, a megacity of some 11 million people and capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is under curfew after the WHO detected an exponential rise in cases in May 2021. "We are not only overwhelmed, but sometimes we are without water, electricity, oxygen, or even beds," said Augustin Mulumba, a doctor who works on the Covid-19 ward in the Hopital du Cinquantenaire, a large private hospital in Kinshasa.

Daily infections in South Africa's most-populous province of Gauteng, home to its political and economic capitals, Pretoria and Johannesburg, have nearly doubled over the past week. Epidemiologists warn that the cities may set a record for deaths later this month [June 2021].

At Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg, Covid-19 patients have to wait up to 5 days for a spot in the intensive-care unit, while beds in other wards are also quickly filling up, a doctor working there said. At Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, another large public hospital in Johannesburg, doctors from other departments are being shifted to the Covid-19 ward to help deal with an influx of patients.

The lack of knowledge about Covid-19 and problems with vaccine distribution could lead to more and stronger variants in the future, the director of CDC Africa and the UK Chair of Covid-19 Genomics tell the WSJ's Betsy McKay.

Concerned about its struggling economy, the South African government has been reluctant to impose a new lockdown, with indoor dining and gatherings of up to 100 people still permitted.

According to official data, infections in Africa are still just a tiny fraction of the global case load. But limited testing capacities and widespread reluctance to seek help at hospitals, even during severe illness, mean that the true scale of the pandemic on the continent remains hard to assess.

Some doctors and health officials in the hardest-hit countries say this new surge in infections looks more dangerous than previous ones. "This new wave is more deadly; more young people are getting infected," said Medard Rutaro, a surgeon at Mulago Hospital in Uganda. "This is no longer the disease of old people."

The East African nation of 42 million people saw Covid-19 cases more than double for the 2nd week running, to 1144, as infections clustered among healthcare workers and school and university students, mostly in the capital Kampala. President Yoweri Museveni announced a new lockdown on Sun 6 Jun 2021, closing schools for 6 weeks and banning most gatherings, warning that "the intensity of severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients and deaths is much higher in this wave."

At Mulago Hospital, Uganda's largest, streams of ambulances are bringing critically ill patients in need of oxygen. With intensive-care units full, patients are forced to sleep on the hospital floor. Doctors here say they have detected a noticeable rise in the number of severe cases among younger people.

Uganda has only received 1/3rd of the 3 million vaccines the Covax program was supposed to deliver by the end of May 2021. Covax is no longer receiving shots from its main supplier in India due to an export ban imposed by the government in New Delhi but says it is working to close a gap of some 250 million vaccine doses by the end of September 2021 through donated shots and deals with other manufacturers. Some 4000 Chinese vaccines arrived in December 2020 but were only given to selected Ugandan government officials and Chinese diaspora workers.

Public health officials are also concerned about the appearance of the Delta variant, a strain 1st detected in India. Early data from the U.K. indicates that the variant is between 40-80% more transmissible than the Alpha variant that is currently dominant in Europe and the U.S.

It is growing more prevalent in Kampala and Kinshasa but has only been detected in small numbers in South Africa. Very limited genome sequencing -- used to identify variants -- in most African countries makes it difficult to understand whether it is driving some of the current surges, said Dr. Nkengasong.

Africa's current wave is set to exacerbate an historic divergence between economies in the world's richest and poorest nations.

Unvaccinated and without the help of large government stimulus measures, the continent's middle class, a key engine of economic, educational, and political development, is contracting rapidly, according to the Pew Research Center. It has barely been dented in the U.S. and China.

Of the 2.2 billion vaccines given globally, fewer than 36 million have been administered in Africa, according to the Africa CDC. Three African countries -- Tanzania, Burundi, and Eritrea -- have vaccinated no one. Without a boost in supplies, just 7 countries in the WHO Africa region will have vaccinated 10% of their populations by the end of September 2021, said the agency's regional director, Matshidiso Moeti.

In the Seychelles, Africa's most vaccinated country, there has been a resurgence in cases, likely due to new variants and the relatively lower efficacy of the Sinopharm vaccine.

Families in Uganda are already counting the cost. Susan Buwule tried to find a spot for her Covid-stricken mother in every intensive-care unit in Kampala, but there were no beds available. Her mother died on Monday [7 Jun 2021]. "They were all full with Covid-19 patients," said Ms. Buwule. "The doctors believe she would have survived had she found a bed."

[This is a terrible situation that should never have been allowed to occur. It's unacceptable that 3 African countries, Tanzania, Burundi, and Eritrea, have not been able to vaccinate a single individual. In addition to the inequity of the situation for Africans, the greater the circulation of the virus, the greater the opportunity for new consequential mutations to occur and spread worldwide. - Mod.LK]

[3] Africa (Uganda): cases surge
Date: Mon 7 Jun 2021

More restrictions will be reinforced in Uganda to curb the spread of a 2nd wave of Covid-19 amid a sharp rise in cases, President Yoweri Museveni confirmed in a televised address on Sun 6 Jun 2021 night.

All schools and institutions of higher learning will be closed for 42 days starting Mon 7 Jun 2021 morning, the president said, adding that all teachers will be required to be vaccinated before returning to the classroom. "There is an increasing number of clusters of infections in schools," Museveni said.

Inter-district travel will also be banned for 42 days starting on 10 Jun 2021 to minimize the movement of people and the spread of the virus from district-to-district.

Additionally, communal gathering in places of worship will be suspended for 42 days, but social gatherings will be limited to a maximum capacity of 20 people.

Countries in Africa fear they could become the next India as vaccine supplies dwindle.

On 4 Jun 2021, Uganda registered its highest single daily record, with 1259 confirmed cases, at a positivity rate of 17%. But only 8% of the cases from the last 14 days were admitted into hospitals.

"In this wave, the intensity of severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients and deaths is higher than what we experienced in the 1st wave," Museveni said. "In the previous wave, it took us 3-4 months to get to the current state of critical and severe patients. While in the 2nd wave, it has taken us less than 2 weeks to get to the same situation."

As the 2nd wave grips Uganda, the country continues to struggle with vaccine shortages, having only vaccinated less than 2% of the population. President Museveni announced he would try to procure China's Sinovac vaccine, Russia's Sputnik-V vaccine, and Johnson & Johnson doses for Uganda, but offered no further details.

Museveni stressed that reinforcing restrictions was critical to prevent exhausting hospital capacities. But he threatened that if the restrictions were not followed and the situation worsened, he would put the country back on a total lockdown.

Uganda took stringent steps to try to halt the spread of the virus early on in the pandemic last year [2020]. It was one of the 1st African countries to impose travel restrictions on its citizens and others traveling from 16 countries it said had a high number of cases of coronavirus, including the US and UK. It was also among the 1st African country to announce a ban on large public gatherings including weddings, church and Jumat services for a period of 30 days. On 18 Mar 2021, schools were closed and public rallies banned.

["The few who were lucky enough to get one AZ shot in Uganda are testing positive for whatever strain is circulating there now. The saddest thing is nobody listened to the pleas for genomic surveillance a year ago. So, buckle up world. The Ugandan variant will make her debut" (https://twitter.com/laura_boykin).

"More restrictions will be reinforced in Uganda to curb the spread of a 2nd wave of Covid-19. It is so bad that the country has turned its main national stadium into a hospital." - CNN Early Start @EarlyStart 10 Jun 2021 (https://twitter.com/LarryMadowo).

According to CNN, WHO said cases in Uganda were up 137% last week. Less than 2% of the population has been vaccinated. This is a heartbreaking and very dangerous situation that can only be remedied by wealthier countries coming together to supply vaccines to countries in need. - Mod.LK]

[4] China: lockdown following new outbreak
Date: Wed 9 Jun 2021
Source: New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/world/asia/china-covid-lockdown.html


China appeared to get the coronavirus under control nearly a year ago. But hundreds of millions of Chinese people remain unvaccinated. New variants of the coronavirus have appeared, and questions remain about whether China's self-made vaccines can stop them.

The latest cases have been found in Guangzhou, capital of the southern province of Guangdong. The authorities have blamed the Delta variant, which has caused widespread loss of life in India.

The city tested practically its entire population of 18.7 million between Sun 6 Jun and Tue 8 Jun 2021, some of them for the 2nd time. It has also put neighborhoods with a total of more than 180 000 residents into total lockdowns, with practically no one allowed out except for medical testing.

The early infections appear to have jumped from person to person at a cluster of eateries. Each infected person has infected more people than in any previous outbreak that China has confronted, Zhang Zhoubin, deputy director of the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control, said at a news conference.

"The epidemic faced by Guangzhou this time is an unprecedented opponent, and it requires more resolute and decisive measures to deal with it," he said.

Test facilities in Guangzhou have been operating around the clock. Lines are long. Residents wake early to try to beat the rush, but still find delays.

China's approach has evolved since the coronavirus 1st emerged, when Beijing initially put harsh restrictions on hundreds of millions of people. Today, its lockdowns are focused on neighborhoods rather than cities or provinces. China has made vaccination the centerpiece of its strategy.

Still, many of the core tenets remain for a huge and densely populated country: vast testing, strict limits on movement, and intense scrutiny of arrivals from other countries.

Foreign businesses have worried that those limits on international travelers could snarl their plans. A European Union Chamber of Commerce survey released this week found that 3/4ths of member companies said they had been adversely affected by travel restrictions, usually by hindering them from bringing in key engineers or executives.

Beijing has demanded that travelers from dozens of countries spend 2 weeks in employer-supervised quarantine even before flying to China. Once there, travelers must spend at least 2 weeks and sometimes 3 or longer in government-supervised quarantine, even if they are fully vaccinated. Rounds of tests can turn up a possibly false positive, leading to more tests and additional days or weeks in isolation.

Many businesses expect that China may retain stringent travel restrictions through February 2022, when Beijing will host the Winter Olympics, and possibly through autumn of next year [2021], when the Chinese Communist Party will hold its party congress.

Many foreigners in China face a choice: If they leave to visit spouses, children, and other family members elsewhere, they may be unable to re-enter the country later because of the pandemic restrictions.

"There is absolutely a growing fatigue for a lot of the foreigners who are here," said Jacob Gunter, senior policy and communications manager at the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.

At home, China's leaders are pushing its people to get vaccinated. It has administered about 800 million doses by the government's count, compared with 300 million administered in the United States. Yin Weidong, the chairman and chief executive of Sinovac Biotech, one of China's main vaccine manufacturers, told state television last Friday that Chinese regulators had approved the emergency use of vaccines in children as young as 3.

Still, administering 800 million doses -- almost all of the vaccines require 2 shots -- means that most of China's 1.4 billion people have not been fully vaccinated. Some people remain hesitant to get the shots, and Chinese media outlets have used the Guangzhou outbreak to encourage skeptics to get inoculated.

The spread of the virus has raised fresh questions about the effectiveness of China's vaccines, particularly against variants. The Seychelles last month [May 2021] and now Mongolia in the past 3 weeks have both had large numbers of infections despite high vaccination rates. Both have used the Sinopharm vaccine from China, although the Seychelles also relied partly on AstraZeneca vaccines.

The Delta variant now circulating in Guangzhou has also shown the ability in other countries to infect some people who had already been vaccinated, a phenomenon known as vaccine escape. Research elsewhere has found that to be a particular problem for people who have received only a 1st injection of a 2-jab vaccine and are then exposed to the Delta variant.

Researchers in Britain have found that receiving only the 1st of 2 shots of the Oxford-AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines may be only 30 percent effective in preventing infection with the Delta variant, said Raina MacIntyre, who heads the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute of the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

After 2 doses, effectiveness appears to rise to 60 percent with the AstraZeneca vaccine and 88 percent with Pfizer-BioNTech. "With the degree of vaccine escape there is with the Delta variant, you really do need people to be fully vaccinated," she said.

Mr. Yin, of Sinovac, told China's state-run television on Sat [5 Jun 2021] that a 3rd shot of his company's vaccine produces a 10-fold increase in antibodies within a week. But Chinese vaccine manufacturers are not yet recommending a 3rd dose.

"As far as China is concerned, in fact, completing the 2-shot immunization is the most important task for all the public," he said.

In the meantime, Guangzhou has tried to turn its virus setback into a showcase for local technologies. Officials there said they had used 31 driverless shuttle vans and trucks to send food and other critical supplies into locked down neighborhoods to avoid exposing delivery personnel.

By Tue [8 Jun 2021], Guangdong Province had 157 people in hospital with the virus and was announcing about 10 new cases per day. The province and also Guangzhou itself have banned anyone since last weekend from leaving unless they have a valid reason and a negative nucleic acid test for the virus within the preceding 48 hours.

Unlike many places around the world, Guangzhou at least does not have to worry about running out of pandemic supplies: It is coincidentally a hub for manufacturing and exporting them. Chen Jianhua, chief economist of the Guangzhou Bureau of Industry and Information Technology, said at a news conference on Wed [9 Jun 2021] that the city's daily production capacity was 91 million masks and 7 million sets of coronavirus detection chemicals.

[5] Indonesia: spike
Date: Fri 11 Jun 2021
Source: CNN from Reuters [edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/11/asia/coronavirus-variants-indonesia-clusters-intl-hnk/index.html


A jump in coronavirus cases on Indonesia's 2 most populous islands has health experts worried the worst could be yet to come, with few curbs on movement at a time when dangerous variants drive record fatalities elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

Case numbers have risen sharply in Java and Sumatra 3 weeks after holidays that followed the Islamic fasting month, when millions ventured across the archipelago, ignoring a temporary travel ban.

In Kudus, central Java, cases skyrocketed 7594% since then, according to Wiku Adisasmito of Indonesia's Covid-19 taskforce. Healthcare reinforcements have been brought in, but hospital capacity had hit 90%, local media reported.

Defriman Djafri, an epidemiologist from Andalas University in Padang, said fatalities in West Sumatra in May 2021 were the highest on record.

In Riau on Sumatra, daily cases more than doubled from early April 2021 to over 800 by mid-May 2021, while the positivity rate was at 35.8% last week, said Wildan Asfan Hasibuan, an epidemiologist and provincial task force adviser.

Beyond India, a growing number of Asian countries are being ravaged by fresh coronavirus waves. Wildan attributed the spike to increased mobility and possible spread of coronavirus variants, which have driven big spikes in many countries.

The impact of variants is hard to determine in Indonesia, which has limited genomic sequencing capacity. The country also has testing and tracing shortfalls, and its immunization drive has progressed slowly, with one in 18 people targeted for inoculations fully vaccinated so far.

Recent studies have also indicated that cases could be far higher than the nearly 1.9 million known infections, among Asia's highest caseloads.

Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist from Australia's Griffith University, said Indonesia should take variants more seriously, particularly the B.1.617.2 strain [Delta variant], 1st identified in India, which he said was in its early stage of spreading.

"If we don't change our strategy, we will face an explosion of cases in the community, and mortality will increase," he said. "It means sooner or later it will reach the more vulnerable; we will face an explosion of cases, which we cannot contain or respond to in our health facilities."
