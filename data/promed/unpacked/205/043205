Cuba suspends measles vaccination
---------------------------------
HAVANA (AP): Cuba announced on Thursday that its measles vaccination
program had been suspended after an "uncommon accident" with imported
vaccine dosages that left 3 children dead and 42 others sick. The 3
children died last week after receiving injections from "apparently
contaminated" vials filled with the anti-measles vaccine manufactured in
India. "After the accident was known, it was decided a week ago to stop the
vaccinations underway across the country," the government said in a
communique carried in the Communist Party daily Granma. Cuba said it had
formed a commission to investigate.
The communique said the vaccines had been certified by and acquired through
the World Health Organization. It provided no other details on Cuba's
acquisition of the vaccines, nor where in Cuba the children had died.
"Through the Health Ministry's monitoring systems, an uncommon accident was
detected on 22 May 2002 in several vaccinated children," the communique said.
Cuba said that during this year's anti-measles campaign more than 750 000
other children between 4 and 9 years old have been vaccinated without
adverse reactions. Cuba, which is proud of its world renowned childhood
health care programs, has had an extensive vaccination program for its
children since the 1970s.
Cuba produces some vaccines, such as for meningitis B and hepatitis B. But
it does not manufacture vaccines for childhood diseases such as measles,
said Dr Pedro Lopez Saura, clinical trials director for Cuba's Center of
Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.

[Last year a cluster of deaths was associated with measles vaccination in
Algeria (see ProMED-mail postings listed below). Investigation revealed
that an inappropriate diluent was used to reconstitute the lyophilized
vaccine, and involved one vial of vaccine used in the country. The above
report mentions use of "contaminated vaccine" with 3 deaths and 42
additional ill children. As the newswire goes on to mention that more than
750 000 other children were vaccinated with measles vaccine without any
untoward effects, one wonders if this incident might be due to a similar
cause. There is no mention of the geographic distribution of the cases, nor
of the clinical syndromes involved. If all affected children came from the
same vaccination center it would more strongly suggest a localized event
rather than a broader vaccine supply event.
ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this episode from
official sources, rather than rely upon speculation and information from
the lay press. - Mod.MPP]
