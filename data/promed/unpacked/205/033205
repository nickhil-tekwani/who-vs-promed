Spain, Europe's biggest tourism destination by revenue, confirmed its
1st case of bird flu.
The National Laboratory at Algete near Madrid
found the H5N1 virus in a sample taken from a
grebe [diving waterfowl] found in the province of
Alava, the Agriculture Ministry today said on its Web site.
Avian influenza has spread across the European Union, prompting some
consumers to spurn poultry. The World Health Organization has said
there's no risk in eating poultry or eggs that are properly cooked.
The World Tourism Organization said it's safe to travel to countries
that have reported bird flu as long as tourists avoid close contact
with birds.
Spain gets 46 billion euros (USD 59 billion) in revenue a year from
foreign tourists and the industry makes up about 1/10 of gross
domestic product. Most tourists come from the U.K., Germany and
France. Hotel companies such as Sol Melia SA and airlines including
Iberia Lineas Aereas de Espana SA depend on tourism for profit growth.
Germany, Greece, Italy, Hungary, Slovenia and Austria are among
countries that have reported outbreaks, mostly in swans.
Most of the people who have contracted the virus [so far 10 countries
have recorded human cases; none of them in Europe - Mod.AS] handled
infected poultry or came in contact with their excrement.

A laboratory in Spain has confirmed the country's 1st case of the
H5N1 bird flu, found in a wild bird in the northern province of
Alava, the Agriculture Ministry said on Friday.
The waterfowl, a great crested grebe [Picture at

picked up in a marsh area outside the city of Vitoria.
The director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC) said Friday that Europe should expect a seasonal
pattern of avian influenza in the coming months and years.
"As long as the virus is endemic in Asia and parts of Africa, it's
quite likely it will reappear in Europe," Zsuzsanna Jakab told a news
conference in Brussels.
Last month, Jakab told an ECDC conference in Athens that migrating
birds are carrying the respiratory disease and Europe "must be
prepared."
Spain is on the route of northern-bound migratory birds from Africa.

Spanish authorities have confirmed the country's 1st case of the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu.
A great crested grebe was found dead in the northern province of
Alava, in marshes in Salburua lake near the city of Vitoria.
"The National Reference Laboratory has confirmed a case of highly
pathogenic H5N1 type bird flu," the agriculture ministry said in a
statement.
Spanish vice-president Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega has appealed
for calm and advised that the case would not affect people.
A protection zone of 3 km (2 miles) has been set up around the area
where the wild bird was found and up to 10 km from the spot is to be
monitored.
Spanish officials said in 2005, after news that bird flu had spread
to a number of European countries, including France and Romania, that
it was "only a matter of time" before the disease reached Spain,
especially as it is on the northbound migratory route for birds from
Africa.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza in wildlife in
Spain: (Disease never reported before in Spain).
Translation of information received on 7 Jul 2006
from Dr Lucio Ignacio Carbajo Goni, Deputy
Director General of Animal Health, Ministry of
Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Madrid:
Report date: 7 Jul 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: first
occurrence of a listed disease or infection in a country.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 30 Jun 2006.
[There is no hint here of the report that the
bird died 6 weeks ago.-- see part [5] below. - Mod.JW]
An outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza
in wildlife has been reported in Salburua
wetlands, Alava province (Pais Vasco) in a great
crested grebe (_Podiceps cristatus_) that has been found dead.
The diagnosis has been established by the Central
Veterinary Laboratory at Algete using RT-PCR and sequence analysis.
[Algete is not on OIE's list of Reference
laboratories for HPAI -- see:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/oie/organisation/en_listeLR.htm> - Mod.JW]
The control measures undertaken include -zoning:
a 3-km-radius protection zone around the outbreak
and a 10-km-radius surveillance zone around the
outbreak have been established. There are no
commercial poultry holdings within this
10-km-radius area; within this area, movement of
poultry, other captive birds and their products
is prohibited. Any birds gathering [sic] and any
wild birds game [sic] are also under ban;
[The original Spanish, from <http://www.oie.int/Messages/060707ESP.htm> is:
"... las reuniones o concentraciones de aves y de
la caza de aves silvestres en todas sus
modalidades,", which is better translated as:
".. meetings and concentrations of birds [as in
agricultural or bird fancier shows], and the
hunting of wild birds in all forms, are also under ban." - Mod.JW]
- screening;
- control of wildlife reservoirs;
- surveillance in the natural spaces to detect as
soon as possible any mortality in wild birds.

Spanish H5N1 grebe unlikely to be from Africa
--------------------------------------------------
Spain confirmed its first case of the highly
pathogenic form of avian influenza H5N1 today. A
dead Great Crested Grebe _Podiceps cristatus_
found at Salburua Lake near the city of Vitoria
in the Basque country of northern Spain tested positive for the deadly virus.
"There are some puzzling aspects to this case,
and we hope that ornithologists will be allowed
to examine the corpse for clues," said Dr Richard
Thomas of BirdLife International. "Too often,
invaluable information as to the source of the
virus in wild birds has been wasted because
appropriate experts have not been called in."
For example, correct identification of the
species involved is vital; earlier this year, a
dead Whooper Swan in the UK was incorrectly
identified as a resident species (a Mute Swan).
If it is a Great Crested Grebe, then determining
the subspecies involved is essential: birds from
sub-Saharan Africa are subtly different from
those found in Europe, and have never been
recorded north of the Sahara. Even a North
African origin is highly unlikely: only a handful
of Great Crested Grebes nest there.
Another vital clue is the age of the affected
bird: if it was hatched in 2006, it indicates a
local source of infection. Young grebes will only
just have fledged and Great Crested Grebes are
not migrating in early July. Indeed, birds in
northern Spain are regarded as sedentary.
However, some reports indicate the corpse was
found 6 weeks ago: if true, then the bird must
have died sometime in May. "Perhaps the most
likely explanation is that it was one of the
scattering of wild birds killed by H5N1 this
spring in Europe - possibly a bird that wintered
in an affected part of the Mediterranean," Thomas
added. [For one such report, attributed to Reuters, see
<http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/first-bird-flu-case-reported-on-spanish-radio/2006/07/07/1152240486843.html>

It is quite strange that this key detail has been
omitted from most media versions of the report,
as it totally alters the epidemiological
interpretation of the event, as stated above. - Mod.JW]

[Since 1 Jun 2006, Poland, Switzerland, France,
Czech Republic and Denmark have reported 30 days
with no new cases of H5N1 in wildlife or affected
poultry to OIE and subsequent lifting of Avian Influenza restrictions.
This report from Spain is their 1st case and so,
on a European level, we seem to be taking 3 or 4
steps forward and a step backwards. Such a
situation is not bad, all things considered.
However, this is not the time of year we would
expect new cases in wild birds, so we will have
to wait to see what the fall and spring bring
before declaring a trend. In the mean time, we
wait, watch and report. - Mod.PC]
[A confirmation of the report from a reference
laboratory is anticipated, as well as available
details on the clinical condition of the Great
crested grebe (_Podiceps cristatus_) when
sampled, including the date of sampling.
Salburua lake (196 hectares, about 2 sq km) is situated on the
eastern edge of the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz. It is regarded as one of
the most valuable continental wetlands in the Basque Country and is a
Ramsar* (see further) Wetland of International Importance. Map at

*The Convention on Wetlands, signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, is an
intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for "national
action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise
use of wetlands and their resources". There are presently 145
Contracting Parties to the Convention, with 1435 wetland sites,
totaling 1 251 000 square km, designated for inclusion in the Ramsar
List of Wetlands of International Importance. - Mod.AS]
