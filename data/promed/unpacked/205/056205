This is interesting. I have tried my best to stir the pot to obtain
definitive information about this epidemic and about the Malaysian
experience to which the Taiwanese press releases refer. To review:
An outbreak of reported myocarditis occurred in Malaysia last year.
ProMED-mail reported what we received and the epidemic was declared over
after a while. The etiologic agent was said to have been due to
enterovirus 71.
We then received reports from various people who took exception to the
official reports and indicated there was more involved than simply
enterovirus 71 and that it might even have been that enterovirus 71 was not
the etiologic agent and that myocarditis not the principal sign. We have
heard of three viruses from Malaysian patients: enterovirus 71, Coxsackie
virus B (probably B4), and an adenovirus or some adenoviruses.
ProMED-mail relies on its readers (subscribers) to submit information
(opinions welcome but data very welcome) and if we do not receive data
there is not much we can do.
Recently, when the Taiwanese reported an epidemic among children and said
the etiologic agent was the same as that of the Malaysian epidemic, I was
lost. If the Malaysian epidemic was not due to enterovirus 71, then what
was the etiologic agent of the Taiwanese epidemic?
Anonymous (to our readers; I know who they are) Malaysians sent me messages
after I posted a number of questions I felt should be asked. Some
indicated that there is an adenovirus, or a number of adenoviruses,
associated with the Malaysian cases. Others indicated that the US Centers
for Disease Control had tested many specimens and by now should have
reported the results of their tests. Still others said the pathology
reports indicated encephalitis, not myocarditis.
It is important to keep in mind that the US Centers for Disease Control,
the world's preeminent disease investigation organization, is invited by
states (U.S.) and countries to assist in investigations. Doesn't matter
that sometimes the country's health organization doesn't have a clue as to
what's going on, the CDC is still just "helping". Therefore, it is
impossible for CDC to release any information unless the inviting country
approves such release. If CDC would release information without such
approval, it would never be invited back. I am sure everyone understands
that. CDC has an 8 June press release about the Taiwanese epidemic on its
web site:

It described the illness in brief and indicates that some of the children
had hand foot and mouth disease (most common cause Coxsackie A16; second
most common cause enterovirus 71). Critically, this report indicates that
there have been three types of cases: hand, foot and mouth disease,
meningitis-encephalitis, and fatal and that it is unclear whether the three
types of cases are related. Enterovirus 71 has been identified most often
but is not yet confirmed as the cause of the outbreak.
In response to this, I sent a message to the Malaysian Ministry of Health
asking for clarification of the final report of their 1997 epidemic but
have received no response.
Meanwhile, on 8 June, Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org> sent a message
indicating that Agence France Presse had reported the death of a
nine-year-old girl who "died Monday after succumbing to an intestinal virus
epidemic sweeping Taiwan, bringing the toll to 32" [36 as of 14 June -
Mod.CHC. Apparently, according to this report, Taiwanese health
authorities have announced the disease was under control. This may be
overly optimistic, given that the Malaysian epidemic lasted four months;
Taiwanese authorities have cited 6 weeks as the length of the Malaysian
epidemic.
Some people went so far as to send me long messages and manuscript drafts,
not for posting on ProMED-mail, but simply to tell me they feel they have
answers to my questions but that the local laws include an "official
secrets act", so I cannot post their messages.
As I am not the least bit concerned about a Malaysian official secrets act,
here is my opinion of this situation: Early one, perhaps too early,
Malaysian authorities made a declaration of the etiologic agent of the
myocarditis epidemic. Not only did the epidemic turn out to be an
encephalitis epidemic, the etiologic agent mentioned was not the definitive
one or not the only one. Rather than correct their error, they continued
to stand by their original statements and have not given approval for CDC
to report the entire story. Keeping in mind that I have no idea about
either the disease or the etiologic agents involved in this situation
(that's the point, isn't it?), I will not post any more so-called
information about the etiologic agent of the Malaysian epidemic and will
continue to have doubts about the etiologic agent of the Taiwanese
epidemics, so long as the latter is continued to be characterized as "like
the Malaysian one".
For those who want to keep up with what the popular press is saying in
Taiwan, I suggest you read the China Times web site:
Taiwan Headline News @Sinanet.com (<http://ww10.sinanet.com/twnews/eng/>)
China Times Inter@ctive(<http://www.chinatimes.com.tw/english/english.htm>)
Finally, it may very well be that this is an extremely unique situation in
that the individual etiologic agents and the individual diseases they cause
are well characterized but that multiple simultaneous infections with these
viruses cause a presently unrecognized constellation of signs and symptoms,
the complexity of the virologic situation masking the singular problems.

Taiwan yesterday braced for the further spread of a virus that has killed
33 children, as a top pediatrician warned that the disease could spread to
Hong Kong and the rest of South-East Asia. A one-year old girl believed to
be infected with the virus died in a hospital here on Wednesday, pushing
the death toll to 33, Health Department spokesman Hsu Kuo-hsiung said. The
disease would intensify in Taiwan's northern countries, which have been
lightly affected so far, Li Chin-yun, a top pediatrician advising health
authorities here, said. The enterovirus which attacks children below five
years old, has been plaguing central and southern Taiwan where most of the
33 victims were found.
The spread of the virus is getting out of control, according to Li. US
disease experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called
in to help in the investigation were due to provide an update of the virus
situation later yesterday.
Initial investigations conducted by the US experts suggest that a mutated
hybrid form of the virus may have developed, the China News said. Hsu said
that "preliminary tests" showed "there is a possibility that there is
another type of enterovirus".
COMMENTS (by Ken Lam)
The fear of the disease spreading to other Southeast Asian countries has
given rise to concern, judging by the many inquiries received from readers.
Many requests are for detailed clinical information so that cases can be
recognized quickly and we have referred them to our earlier postings in
ProMED-mail. I would like to encourage others from Malaysia as well as
Japan and elsewhere to present their case findings for the benefit of all.
Perhaps the CDC experts in Taiwan can provide us with an insight of the
cases in Taiwan and how these cases compare with those seen in Sarawak last
year.
In the press release above, suggestion was made to the possibility of a
mutated virus form and another type of enterovirus being present. In five
EV71 isolates recovered from brainstem tissues of children who died from
fatal brainstem encephalomyelitis in Peninsular Malaysia, we found
characteristic 5'UTR sequences which did not resemble the two established
EV71 strains, namely, EV71MS and EV71BrCr. It will be interesting to obtain
further information from Taiwan in support of their suggestion of a mutated
virus or indeed a second enterovirus.
We understand that permission for autopsy was given in one case in Taiwan
and we hope the findings can be shared with ProMED-mail readers. In our
fatal cases, a quick answer was obtained by fixing a small piece of tissue
e.g. medulla or cervical cord and process for paraffin embedding in 24
hours. Alternatively, according to our University Hospital pathologist
Prof. K.T. Wong, a frozen section will also yield a quicker answer while
waiting for more conventional methods which will take 1-2 weeks.
