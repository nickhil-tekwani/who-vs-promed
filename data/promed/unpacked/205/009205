It has also been reported in an Arabic Daily [Al-Iqtisadiah, Wed 4 Oct
2000 that there has been a report in nearby Jordan of 6 suspected cases of
infection with either West Nile Virus or Rift Valley fever virus. A senior
Jordanian health official, Dr Sa'ad Kharabishah, was quoted as saying that
3 samples had been sent to the US for examination, and a report was
expected in 2 days time.
Dr Sa'ad Kharabishah also stated that there had been a report of West Nile
virus infection in a Palestinian citizen admitted into a Jordanian
hospital. The patient is reported to have been based in Israel where he
works. His situation was said to be improving and he may be discharged in 2
days. However, there has been no confirmation of this report in local
English and Arabic language daily newspapers.

[The official statements continue to understate the extent of the outbreak.
There has been no previous suggestion that Rift Valley fever has spread
away from the border region between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The probability
is that the cases reported in Jordan are West Nile virus related because of
the proximity to Israel. -Mod.CP
