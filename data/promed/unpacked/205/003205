Mike,
I'm replying to the list because mail to <Michael.L.Perdue@usa.healthnet.org>
and <mperdue@asrr.arsusda.gov> bounces back.

David Swofford of the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics, National Museum of
Natural History, Smithsonian Instition, Washington, D.C. has written PAUP
(which originally meant Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony). Version 3.0
was available for MacIntoshes. It is currently not available, but a new
version, to be called PAUP*, will be released by Sinauer Associates, of
Sunderland, Massachusetts, no earlier than June 1996. It will have MacIntosh,
DOS, and Unix versions. It will include parsimony, distance matrix,
invariants, and maximum likelihood methods. PAUP 3.0 was probably the most
sophisticated parsimony program, with many options and close compatibility
with MacClade (for which see below). The new program, PAUP*, will become
much broader with the inclusion of more methods. The price will be $100 US
for the MacIntosh or DOS/Windows versions. Their ISBN number will be 0-87893-
802-8 and -803-6. Orders can be placed with Sinauer at orders@sinauer.com,
once it is released.

A thorough check of the Alta Vista website may turn up more.
Good luck.
