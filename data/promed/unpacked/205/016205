In response to a survey sent out by health officials, at least 548 people reported gastrointestinal illness after visiting CLIMB Works in Gatlinburg, Tennessee since 15 Jun 2018. That number is likely a low estimate.

According to Gail Harmon, East Tennessee regional assistant director with the Tennessee Department of Health, 2901 surveys were sent out to people who booked zip line tours online with CLIMB Works. As of Tuesday morning, 10 Jul 2018, 808 people had responded, with 548 of those reporting illness.

Of the 808 responses, Harmon said 505 people said they had parties varying in size from 2 to 30 people, but the surveys did ask how many in the party became sick. It did determine one common denominator though: well water served out of coolers placed along the zipline course.

A spokeswoman with the health department said water testing was conducted, and several samples came back positive for _E. coli_ and total coliforms. Those samples are now being sent to Nashville for further testing, and officials plan to continue testing, such as environmental sampling, to support the investigation.

Those sick are reporting symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea.

Health officials said that anyone who visited CLIMB Works and is experiencing any symptoms associated with gastrointestinal illness should contact their health care provider.

CLIMB Works Smoky Mountains told Gray-TV affiliate WVLT on Mon 9 Jul 2018 that 80 to 100 people called the business to report symptoms of gastrointestinal illness after visiting its zipline attraction in Gatlinburg.

Harmon said multiple complaints about sickness at the zip line course prompted the investigation to begin after 4 Jul 2018.

According to a recent review on CLIMB Works' Facebook page, one woman said she went on a tour on Sat 7 Jun 2018, and by the next afternoon, she was sick, along with 2 children aged 9 and 11 years old, and 5 others. She wrote that she believed contaminated coolers of water along the course were the culprit. "Vomiting, diarrhea, tiredness, terrible sickness," she said.

Other visitors commented on her review, saying they had become sick after tours on dates as far back as 16 Jun 2018. One person said 10 of the 12 people in their group were even bedridden, and several people commented that they had become so sick, they took trips to the emergency room.

CLIMB said it is complying completely and has begun serving bottled water since health officials told them to stop using well water. Manager Brian Turley said a new water filtration system was installed on Tue 10 Jul 2018.

CLIMB Works responded to several of the comments on Facebook, saying they "feel awful if we had any part in anyone getting sick. We did contact the Health Department to try to pinpoint if it was water contamination or the contagious stomach bug that has been affecting the area this summer," CLIMB Works wrote.

[Finding that the water had _E. coli_ and other coliform bacteria does not necessarily mean that _E. coli_ of any of the enteropath types was the cause or one of the causes of this large outbreak associated with a zipline site. Fecally contaminated water can contain a number of pathogens. No information is given regarding any testing done on the affected individuals. - Mod.LL
