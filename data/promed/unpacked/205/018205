Cameroon is struggling to contain a cholera outbreak that has sickened 6000 people with the bacterium and killed nearly 100 since February [2022]. Authorities have dispatched the ministers of health and water to affected areas and have begun quarantining cholera patients to prevent it from spreading. Cameroon's Public Health Ministry said the number of cholera patients received in hospitals was growing by the day.

In the seaside city of Limbe in the past week alone, 200 of 300 patients were treated and discharged from the government hospital. Filbert Eko, the highest-ranking official in Cameroon's Southwest region, where Limbe is located, said the region was the worst hit by cholera, with more than 800 cases since February [2022], forcing the quarantining of patients to prevent the disease from spreading.

"The treatment center will be separated from the hospital and from the public. No outsider will be allowed to have access to the patients," Eko said. "We don't want contact between families and the patients. We are taking [efforts] upon ourselves, searching for resources to feed these patients free of charge."

Cameroon's Public Health Ministry says many of those sickened by cholera do not go to hospitals, seeking only traditional cures, and end up dying at home, though no official figures are given. Health officials are urging traditional healers to direct their cholera patients to the closest hospital.

Linda Esso, director of epidemics and pandemics at Cameroon's Public Health Ministry, said cholera has spread to more than 40% of major towns, including the capital, Yaounde, the economic capital, Douala, and western commercial towns like Buea, Limbe, and Bafoussam. Esso said scores of villages have reported cholera cases, and the entire country is threatened by the outbreak. She said the public should be very careful and protect itself because contaminated persons may be spreading the disease without knowing it.

Cameroon's president, Paul Biya, dispatched the ministers of health and water this week to cholera-affected areas to assess the situation. The 2 ministers blamed a shortage of clean drinking water in towns and villages, brought on by the long dry season, for rising cholera infections. They said medical staff were increased in the areas, and about 30 new public toilets have been constructed in Limbe, Buea, and Douala to improve public hygiene. The ministers called on the public to stop defecating in the open and in streams.

Cameroon's minister of water, Gaston Eloundou Essomba, said officials are also providing clean water to villages and towns hit by the outbreak. He said he has asked the Cameroon Water Distribution Company (CAMWATER) to make sure trucks transport water regularly and free of charge to towns and villages that lack piped water. He said the water distribution company should immediately treat water in all community and family wells to ensure the public has quality drinking water.

Cameroon's public health minister, Manaouda Malachie, says Douala's New Bell Prison has become an epicenter of cholera. He said hygiene had been improved at the prison but would not say how many of the more than 6000 inmates were infected or died from the bacterium.

Cameroon suffers from frequent cholera outbreaks. One of the worst, in 2011, infected more than 23 000 people and killed more than 800.

[2] Cholera: Malawi (Southern Region) ex Mozambique

Cholera continues to spread in Nsanje as the district has registered 3 new cases, taking the total number of registered cases to 45 with 2 deaths in 3 weeks. Nsanje District Environmental Health Officer, Fred Minyeriwa, confirmed that the 3 new cases are all from Mozambique.

In an interview with Nsanje News Agency (Mana), Minyeliwa said Nsanje District Hospital has put in place various measures to control further spread of the disease, saying the rate of the spread was alarming. "The district health office conducted orientation of boat operators' committees from Marka to Sankhulani. It also provided chlorine and buckets at handwashing points and oriented newly recruited health surveillance assistants (HSAs) in disease surveillance," he said.

The environmental officer further said the district health office also conducted community awareness through community radios, carried out integrated food-premises inspection exercises, and put in place many other measures to contain the disease. He then urged people in the district to follow all preventive measures to complement efforts by the district to deal with cholera outbreak in the district. Currently, the district health office and the district information office have jointly embarked on massive awareness campaign on prevention of cholera in the district.

The 1st cholera case was reported early March [2022] in the district, which health officials say was from Mozambique.

[Contaminated water is the main factor related to widespread dissemination of _Vibrio cholerae_, the cause of cholera.

The 209th anniversary of the birth of John Snow, an early epidemiologist who, in 1854, discovered contaminated water as the source of cholera, occurred recently on 15 Mar 2022. The following is a discussion of the discovery:

"How often does a map change the world? In 1854, one produced by Doctor John Snow, altered it forever.

"In the world of the 1850s, cholera was believed to be spread by miasma in the air, germs were not yet understood, and the sudden and serious outbreak of cholera in London's Soho was a mystery. So Snow did something data journalists often do now: he mapped the cases. The map essentially represented each death as a bar, and you can see them in the smaller image above [to see the map, refer to the source URL above]. It became apparent that the cases were clustered around the pump in Broad (now Broadwick) Street.

"There were some outliers, though, and Snow wrote that 'in some of the instance[s], where the deaths are scattered a little further from the rest on the map, the malady was probably contracted at a nearer point to the pump.'

"One 59-year-old woman sent daily for water from the Broad Street pump because she liked its taste. Wrote Snow,

"'I was informed by this lady's son that she had not been in the neighbourhood of Broad Street for many months. A cart went from Broad Street to West End every day, and it was the custom to take out a large bottle of the water from the pump in Broad Street, as she preferred it. The water was taken on Thursday 31 August, and she drank of it in the evening, and also on Friday. She was seized with cholera on the evening of the latter day and died on Saturday.'

"At a local brewery, the workers were allowed all the beer they could drink; it was believed they didn't drink water at all. But it had its own water supply, too, and there were consequently fewer cases.

"In nearby Poland street, a workhouse was surrounded by cases but appeared unaffected: this was because, again, it had its own water supply.

"It turned out that the water for the pump was polluted by sewage from a nearby cesspit, where a baby's nappy contaminated with cholera had been dumped. But [Snow] didn't just produce a map; it was one part of a detailed statistical analysis." (http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2013/mar/15/john-snow-cholera-map) - Mod.LL
