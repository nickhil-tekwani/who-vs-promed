GIS & HEALTH
============
Subject: Re: PROMED-AHEAD-EDR: Ebola - Cote d'Ivoire (11)
Just published on GIS and health:
Marion J. C. de Lepper (no pun), Henk J. Scholten, and Richard M. Stern,
eds. THE ADDED VALUE OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SERVICES IN PUBLIC AND
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, US$ 139.50.
Most of the chapters are relevant to emerging diseases, and this looks
like a superb introduction. I am no GIS expert, but I am going to
learn from this book.
