Malarial patients die at Bankura Medical College
------------------------------------------------
The death of 4 malaria patients at Bankura Medical College has prompted the health department to initiate an internal probe to find out the lacunae in the referral system for treating malaria patients.

"Bankura Medical College is the highest referral centre at Bankura District [West Bengal]. 4 patients dying in quick succession at that facility is really a reason for introspection," said a senior official in-charge of the malaria section. "Our officials of the public health department and vector borne disease surveillance section have gone to the hospitals to gather a clear picture of the treatment procedure," said a senior official.

Officials spent the whole day studying bed tickets to figure out the treatment given to the patients who had died from malaria, said hospital sources.

"Senior officials from health secretariat had come for a routine inquiry and they spent the whole day talking to the doctors and nurses of the department. They also collected information about the when these patients had come and in what stage," said a senior administrative official of the hospital.

Health department sources further revealed that the situation of malaria deaths in Bankura and Purulia has improved quite a lot in 2012. "The main purpose is to find out the fault and where it occurred. A patient dying of malaria at the medical college is not acceptable.

We wish to find where the delay occurred and in which place of network it happened," said Shankar Saha, deputy director in charge of malaria section. With dengue sweeping Kolkata and adjoining districts, the malaria deaths have led to major concern. In Kolkata and Salt Lake, the administration spent weeks trying to play down the dengue menace but it can no longer ignore the threat now. "We are investigating these malaria deaths. It is a routine process," said Asit Biswas, health department spokesperson.

[2] Pune, relief camps

Malaria in relief camp: 59 cases
--------------------------------
Cases of malaria are being reported in the relief camps of the riot-hit BTC area, but doctors and other health officials claim that the number of cases is very small and there is no reason to panic. They added proper measures are being taken to ensure that the disease doesn't reach the status of an epidemic in the camps.

The total number of malaria cases reported from the camps of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Dhubri and Bongaigaon is 59. PJ Gogoi, regional director, health and family welfare, said, "We are conducting screening programmes and proper medicines are being administered and DDT is being sprayed in the camps regularly." Jayanta Narlikar, DC Kokrajhar, said, "There are only about 50-60 cases reported till now and we are spraying a lot of DDT in and around the camps.

We have also distributed over 2000 mosquito nets in the camps. So far, we are taking utmost care to ensure that the situation doesn't go out of hand and we are doing our best to prevent an outbreak."

Uttam Brahma, district programme manager, Kokrajhar, said, "Though the situation is improving now, this is the monsoon season and during this time we do get reports of malaria outbreaks. In the camps too, a few malaria cases have been reported, but there is nothing to be worried about."

Malaria has always been a problem for the people of the state, especially during the monsoon, even though the health department claims to carry out awareness programme every year, besides spreading DDT and distributing mosquito nets. The official said that proper measures are being taken to ensure that the number of cases does not increase.

"We are trying to maintain proper hygiene in the camps and we have distributed specially-treated mosquito nets for the inmates recently," he said.

Other than malaria, cases of dysentery, diarrhoea and respiratory tract infection were also reported amongst the children from 2 to 4 years in the camps, after which a special kit and medicines were distributed among the camp inmates. "Malaria is very normal in the season and it is not occurring only in the camps. Proper measures are being taken and things are under control," he added.

Malaria cases on the rise in Pune, Maharashtra
----------------------------------------------
Representative data of 3 hospitals and one accredited pathology laboratory has revealed 73 dengue and 41 malaria cases in last 40 days. However, the actual number of patients down with dengue and malaria is likely to be higher as only about 20 percent of such cases need hospitalisation.

Surgeon Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director of the Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital added: "Since July [2012], we have found 18 positive dengue cases and 7 malaria cases till date. All of these tests were carried out at our in-house pathology laboratory."

Sahyadri Hospital, Deccan branch, also reported steady flow of dengue and malaria cases. "Since July, we have treated 17 positive dengue cases and 21 malaria cases at our hospital till date. The blood samples were tested at our in-house pathlab of our hospital's Deccan branch," said Rajkumar Ambad, chief operative officer of the Sahyadri group of hospitals.

Lajpatrai Arya, chief operating officer, Jehangir hospital, said they had treated 13 positive dengue cases and 11 confirmed malaria cases since June.

Health officials of the Pune Municipal Corporation also admit to the rise in mosquito-borne infections. "There is definitely a rise in dengue and malaria cases in Pune. But, the situation is not alarming," said S T Pardeshi, medical officer of health, PMC.

According to PMC's records, there are only 6 dengue and 25 malaria cases in the city between June and August. "The PMC has asked private hospitals and pathology labs for data of patients, but they do not submit daily case reports of dengue, malaria and other communicable diseases," Pardeshi said.

"Precautionary measures are being taken in slums, with insecticides sprayed at mosquito breeding sites. But since the mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which spreads dengue, breeds in fresh water, it is imperative for every household to observe one day a week as 'dry day,' when all utensils and tanks are emptied and cleaned. This is an effective measure at the domestic level," Pardeshi said.

The civic administration undertakes fogging and spraying in all wards at least twice a week. "The health department has been put on alert and civic hospitals have been instructed to be ready in case the number of patients rises," he added. "A record of mosquito breeding sites is maintained by the staff through the year. It was found that most breeding grounds for dengue mosquito are inside homes," Pardeshi said.

"Vector mosquitoes breed mostly in earthenware, metal drums and concrete cisterns used for domestic water storage as well as discarded plastic food containers, old tyres and other items that collect rainwater. Proper disposal of solid waste and improved water storage practices, which includes covering containers, should be followed," Pardeshi said.

Keep mosquitoes away:
* Discard unwanted things lest they become breeding ground for mosquitoes
* Keep water vessels clean and covered
* Take prompt medical advice in case of fever
* Remove water collected in plates under potted plants. Avoid using plates
* Loosen soil in pots to prevent accumulation of water
* Do not keep tray or receptacles under or on top of air-conditioners
* Change water in flower vases daily. Clean and scrub the inside of vases
* Prevent accumulation of water
* Use repellents

About malaria:
* Caused by Plasmodium parasites, which is spread to humans by Anopheles mosquitoes. Infected mosquitoes bite mainly between dusk and dawn
* Symptoms: fever, shivering, pain in joints, headaches, repeated vomiting, convulsions and coma
