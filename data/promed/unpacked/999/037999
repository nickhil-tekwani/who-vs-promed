The eastern equine encephalitis virus has been detected in Plymouth County for the 1st time this year [2020], the Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced Wednesday [15 Jul 2020].

The presence of EEE was confirmed by the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory in mosquito samples collected on [Mon 13 Jul 2020] from a single location in Carver in Plymouth County.

The findings mark the 3rd time the EEE virus has been confirmed in tested mosquito samples in Massachusetts this year [2020].

The 2 earlier findings of the virus were detected in samples collected 1 Jul and 5 Jul 2020 in Franklin County.

No human or animal case of EEE has been detected so far this year [2020].

EEE is a rare but serious and potentially fatal disease that can affect people of all ages and is generally spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.

There were 12 human cases of EEE in Massachusetts in 2019 with 6 deaths. There's no human vaccine for the virus.

West Nile virus has also been detected this year [2020] in mosquitoes in Middlesex and Suffolk counties. There were 5 human cases of West Nile virus in 2019.

No human or animal cases of West Nile virus have been detected so far this year [2020].

South Carolina's 1st confirmed case of EEE for 2020 occurred this month [July 2020] in Marion County. The yearling Tennessee Walking Horse colt had not been vaccinated and was euthanized.

Officials at Clemson Livestock and Poultry Health (CLPH) have confirmed a 2nd Horry County, South Carolina, horse was euthanized due to EEE. The 10-year-old Quarter Horse mare was reported as unvaccinated. Other horses at the facility have been vaccinated.

The death follows the euthanasia of another Horry County horse earlier in the month [July 2020]: a yearling Quarter Horse filly with unknown vaccination status. A 2-year-old Miniature Horse filly in Edgefield County that had been vaccinated also tested positive and is recovering under voluntary quarantine (see "EEE Spread in South Carolina" at https://thehorse.com/190542/eee-spreads-in-south-carolina/).

EEE 101
Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include the following:

- Avoid mosquito bites. Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn.
- Look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol).
- Apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite.
- Mosquito-proof homes: Fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.
- Protect your horses: Veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the U.S. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year [2020] to vaccinate your horses.
- Use approved insect repellents to protect horses.
- If possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- Eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly.
- Stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance) or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis_ israelensis [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

["In the United States, equine encephalitides for which vaccines are available include eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE), and West Nile Virus encephalomyelitis. The distribution of EEE has historically been restricted to the eastern, southeastern, and some southern states (but disease incidence is also reported in the upper midwestern states of Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin). Outbreaks of WEE have been recorded in the western and midwestern states. Variants of WEE have caused sporadic cases in the northeast and southeast, most notably Florida. VEE occurs in South and Central America but has not been diagnosed in the United States for more than 40 years. The availability of licensed vaccine products combined with an inability to completely eliminate risk of exposure justifies immunization against EEE and WEE as core prophylaxis for all horses residing in or traveling to North America and any other geographic areas where EEE and/or WEE is endemic.

"Transmission of EEE/WEE/VEE is by mosquitoes, and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects, to horses from wild birds or rodents, which serve as natural reservoirs for these viruses. Human beings are also susceptible to these diseases when the virus is transmitted to them by infected mosquitoes; however, horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission by mosquitoes is highly unlikely, because the level and duration of viremia is insufficient to infect mosquitoes that might feed on a horse affected with EEE or WEE. On the other hand, the viremia that occurs in horses infected with VEE virus subtypes 1AB and 1C is much higher. Direct horse-to-horse or horse-to-human transmission of VEE is possible. Of these 3 encephalomyelitides, WEE has the lowest mortality (about 50%). Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is the most virulent for horses, with mortality approaching 90%. Epidemiological evidence indicates that young horses are particularly susceptible to disease caused by EEE virus. Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis caused by subtypes 1AB and 1C can give rise to mortality rates ranging from 20-80%; however, some horses develop subclinical infection that results in lasting immunity.

"The risk of exposure and geographic distribution of EEE and WEE vary from year to year with changes in distribution of insect vectors and reservoirs important in the natural ecology of the virus. EEE activity in mosquitoes and birds, and resultant disease in humans and equids, continues to cause concern along the East Coast and demonstrates northward encroachment. WEE has caused minimal disease in horses in the last 2 decades; however, the virus continues to be detected in mosquitoes and birds throughout the western states. In addition, variants that cause clinical disease in equids have been detected in the eastern US.

"VEE is a reportable foreign animal disease. Epidemics of VEE occur when the virus undergoes genetic change and develops greater virulence for humans and equid species. Viral variants, which belong to subtypes 1AB and 1C, are able to multiply to high levels in the horse, which serves as a amplifying host of the virus in these outbreaks. Strains of subtype 1E have also been shown to cause morbidity and mortality in horses but on a much lesser scale. Areas of southern Texas, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the west coast of Florida are likely at the most risk for natural VEE encroachment from Central and South America.

"Vaccination against VEE is controversial because
1. Vaccination against a foreign animal disease may confound testing in the event of an outbreak. However, vaccination against EEE/WEE will also result in cross-reaction to VEE virus in certain serologic tests.
2. Experimental and field data have demonstrated that previous infection with either EEE or WEE may provide cross protection against VEE. It is therefore possible that EEE/WEE bivalent vaccination may provide partial cross-protection, although it is likely to be less than that following infection.
3. A conditionally available modified live (MLV) VEE vaccine has been released during previous outbreaks and provides superior protection against the disease and high titered viremias. Should an outbreak occur, it is likely that this highly attenuated MLV would be released for restricted use subject to certain conditions being met.

"In summary, horses that receive annual EEE/WEE vaccines may be partially protected against VEE infection. In the event of an outbreak, the availability of and vaccination with the highly effective MLV product would induce rapid, complete immunity while allowing for accurate surveillance before VEE specific vaccination. The use of killed VEE vaccine should be performed only in high-risk areas of the US, at the discretion of the attending veterinarian, or when necessary, with input from state agriculture officials. The use of the inactivated VEE vaccine is less effective than the MLV VEE vaccine and will reduce immune responses to the MLV VEE vaccine.

"Vaccines
---------
EEE/WEE vaccines currently available are formalin-inactivated adjuvanted whole virus products. Early testing of bivalent (EEE/WEE) vaccines was performed by intracranial challenge with either EEE or WEE; the formalin-inactivated preparations were shown to be highly efficacious in protecting against clinical disease.

Currently, the only available VEE vaccines are killed products; an MLV would likely be conditionally released in the face of an outbreak.

"Vaccination schedules EEE/WEE
------------------------------

- Adult horses previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: annual revaccination must be completed prior to vector season in the spring. In animals of high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed vaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. In areas where mosquitoes are active year-round, many veterinarians elect to vaccinate horses at 4- to 6-month intervals to ensure uniform protection throughout the year, although this practice is not specifically recommended by manufacturers of vaccines.
- Adult horses, previously unvaccinated against EEE/WEE or of unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 2 doses with a 4- to 6-week interval between doses. Revaccinate prior to the onset of the next vector season and annually thereafter.
- Pregnant mares, previously vaccinated against EEE/WEE: vaccinate 4-6 weeks before foaling.
- Pregnant mares, unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history: immediately begin a 2-dose primary series with a 4-week interval between doses. Booster at 4-6 weeks before foaling or prior to the onset of the next vector season, whichever occurs first.
- Foals of mares vaccinated against EEE/WEE in the pre-partum period: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4-6 months of age. A 4- to 6-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10-12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
- In the southeastern US, due to earlier seasonal disease risk, vaccination may be started at 2-3 months of age. When initiating vaccinations in younger foals, a series of 4 primary doses should be administered, with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and between the 2nd and 3rd doses. The 4th dose should be administered at 10-12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
- Foals of unvaccinated mares or having unknown vaccinal history: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 4-week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and an 8-week interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3-4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the interval of 8 weeks described above.
- Note: Foals in the southeastern USA: the primary vaccination series should be initiated at 3 months of age due to early seasonal vector presence.
- Horses having been naturally infected and recovered: recovered horses likely develop lifelong immunity. Consider revaccination only if the immune status of the animal changes the risk of susceptibility to infection. Examples of these conditions would include the long-term use of corticosteroids and equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID)."
