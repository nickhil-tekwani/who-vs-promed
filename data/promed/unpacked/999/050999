The H5N8 bird flu virus has been detected at a farm outside Acs, in Komarom-Esztergom county, national food safety authority Nebih said on Monday [12 Jan 2020].

The chief public health officer has ordered that the entire stock of the farm, over 53 000 turkeys, should be culled and that poultry be kept indoors across the country, Nebih said.

Nebih also said that the H5N8 strain has not spread to humans in Europe, and poultry products are safe to eat.

Nebih has started monitoring poultry farms in the Acs area and may impose delivery restrictions in order to prevent the virus from spreading.
