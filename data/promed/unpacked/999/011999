Equine influenza has been identified as the respiratory disease that claimed the lives of nearly 60 000 donkeys in West Africa earlier this year [2019].

Despite the huge number of animals being affected, there was initially no formal diagnosis for the disease [sic; see commentary]. Many countries declared the outbreak to be the common respiratory infection strangles. But veterinarians from the international animal charity Spana noticed that the outbreak that swept through Mali and other parts of West Africa this year [2019] behaved more like a respiratory virus.

From January until June 2019, Mali suffered a serious outbreak of respiratory disease in donkeys and horses. This outbreak was widespread across West Africa and affected several surrounding countries such as Niger, Nigeria and Burkina Faso. Symptoms included high fever, difficulty in breathing and a hard cough, all of which proved highly contagious. Some West African governments announced almost 60 000 donkey deaths resulting from the disease.

At the start of the epidemic, Spana vets in Mali treated thousands of respiratory cases in the Segou region and other locations. Spana provided training to vet professionals on respiratory diseases, how to recognise and manage suspected cases, and on biosecurity measures to help prevent the outbreak from spreading. Thermometers were distributed to animal health technicians to help them monitor suspected cases, and meetings were held with the government veterinary department to report findings and disseminate information as quickly as possible.

Samples were then sent to the Animal Health Trust, a UK laboratory, which led to a confirmed diagnosis of equine influenza virus (equine flu).

[The unofficial report from Mali should not surprise. In fact, the international animal welfare charity The Donkey Sanctuary [UK] warned as early as February 2019 of a potential disease epidemic in West Africa, additional to Nigeria, basing their information on reports from partners in Mali and Ghana. They described donkeys showing similar characteristics of the disease as those reported from Nigeria, including fever and nasal discharge (20190220.6326398).

Massive equine influenza spread, affecting mainly donkeys, with high mortality, has been officially reported from West Africa's Niger, Nigeria and, in particular, Senegal, since late 2018 (see map at https://tinyurl.com/yy9dfwzy; click on the West African cluster and zoom in). The total number of mortalities in West Africa (60 000), quoted in the current media report, deserves to be seen as a rough estimate.

Mali's western neighbor, Senegal, notified the OIE earlier this year (2019) about an event of equine influenza as its "first occurrence of a listed disease". The epizootic reportedly started 26 Mar 2019; the accompanying epidemiological comment said, "Equine influenza occurred as a result of strong winds and dust. Stray donkeys are the main animals affected and play a role in spreading the disease as well as the groupings at weekly markets and watering points". On 3 Jun 2019, the final follow-up report (no. 4) was submitted, concluding: "The event cannot be considered resolved, but the situation is sufficiently stable. No more follow-up reports will be sent. Information about this disease will be included in the next 6-monthly reports". The serotype of the virus strain behind Senegal's major event was reported as 'pending'; it is yet to become established. Most likely, this virus strain is similar to the one circulating in the other regional countries, namely H3N8.

Senegal's equine influenza OIE/WAHID summary, as of 3 Jun 2019, was the following:

Total outbreaks = 287 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 1 332 125 / 41 507 / 2710 / 0 / 0

Equine influenza serotype H3N8 was reported by Nigeria on 7 Jan 2019 as its "first occurrence of a listed disease". It had reportedly started on 17 Dec 2018; most of the outbreaks were reported from the northwest (map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=29135); no new cases have been reported from Nigeria since 22 Jan 2019, but periodic follow-up reports commendably continue to be duly submitted (the most recent, on 25 Jul 2019); the event's current summary follows:

Total outbreaks = 10 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 415 (partial information) / 2961 / 270 / 0 / 0

The "affected population", in all Nigeria's reported outbreaks, was "Donkeys of all ages essentially used for transportation or agricultural and domestic activities".

Niger's (retrospective) OIE report on an event of equine influenza serotype H3N8 was submitted on 15 Jul 2019; the disease, termed "first occurrence of a listed disease", had reportedly started on 1 Oct 2018 and the event was declared resolved 30 Jan 2019; it was confirmed as 'equine influenza H3N8' on 9 Jul 2019. The comment that addressed the issue "affected population", said, "Affected animals have respiratory problems with coughing and sometimes mortality occurs". The species (donkeys?) remained unspecified ("Equidae').

The event was summarised as follows:

Total outbreaks: 4
Total animals affected
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 672 / 188 / 177 / 0 / 0

As apparent from the report's (interactive) map, the 4 outbreaks were located in 4 different provinces in southern parts of Niger, facing Mali and Burkina Faso (see at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=31079). In view of the distance between the reported outbreaks, it may be assumed that the factual number of outbreaks was larger.

Mali is expected to officially notify the OIE about its local event. In Mali's annual reports to the OIE (including 2018), equine influenza has been included among the diseases "for which no Information has been provided". The Segou region is situated northeast to Bamako; see map at https://tinyurl.com/y2smxykg.

It will be interesting to note, from the reference laboratory, if the West African event has been caused by the same virus strain that has been spreading in the UK and other European countries, namely, EIV H3N8 Florida clade 1.

The striking susceptibility of donkeys to the virus deserves to be further studied.

The international animal charity SPANA has been active in Mali since 1996. They maintain one fixed veterinary clinic, based in the capital city, Bamako, and 2 mobile veterinary clinics, visiting smaller towns, villages and rural communities. According to their website, in 2018, 31 167 animals were treated; see https://spana.org/about-us/our-work/mali/. - Mod.AS
