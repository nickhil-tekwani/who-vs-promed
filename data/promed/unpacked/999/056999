------------------------------------------------------------
To clarify some points in a recent newspaper report on coral disease on Kauai that appeared in Kauai Garden Island News and was posted on ProMED 2012(373).

1. There is an epizootic occurring in corals in North Kauai.
2. The US Geological Survey National Wildlife Health Center Honolulu Field Station in collaboration with the University of Hawaii has done on site investigations at 2 reefs on Kauai (Anini and Makua) in August and October [2012]. Both reefs are heavily overgrown by algae and impacted by sediment. Corals affected at Makua are mainly _Montipora patula_ and those at Anini are _M. capitata_. Grossly, corals manifest amorphous to semicircular areas of tissue loss with deposits of organic material on bare skeleton usually separated from intact tissue by a variably sized black band. Lesions encompass 10-80 percent of coral surface. Histopathology of lesions reveals massive coagulation necrosis associated with prominent infiltrates of cyanobacteria and occasionally filamentous irregular walled branching structures compatible in morphology with fungi.
3. Samples of cyanobacterial mats at edges of gross lesions have been sent to University of Hawaii for culture and identification, and those results are pending.
4. Contrary to the newspaper report, the disease affecting corals in Kauai is different than an epizootic of tissue loss that occurred in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu earlier this year [2012]. In that instance, histopathology failed to reveal any infectious agents associated with gross lesions. Tissue loss disease in _M. capitata_ in Kaneohe Bay is enzootic and is associated with a variety of potential causative agents. For more information on this, see a recent paper (Proceedings of Royal Society B 279, 4334-41 [see reference below]).
5. Contrary to the newspaper report, no toxicologic or molecular studies are being done at this time.
6. Sea turtles with tumors are found in the area where affected corals are found on Kauai, but this tumor disease is associated with a herpesvirus and has nothing to do with what is happening to corals. Puffer fish with skin lesions are also showing up at Anini and Makua, but these have not yet been examined to assess whether or not a link exists between them and the lesions in corals.
