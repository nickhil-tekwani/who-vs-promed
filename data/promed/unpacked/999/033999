This week [last week of March, 2015] a pony in York County, Pennsylvania that was febrile and neurologically impaired tested positive for EHV-1 [equine herpesvirus 1] by virus detection testing (PCR).

This pony resides at a very small, private barn which is under formal quarantine by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture [PDA].

Following an epidemiological investigation, one additional equine premises located in Adams County, Pennsylvania, was placed under quarantine due to the index case traveling there on 18 Mar 2015.

Animals on both premises are being monitored carefully for signs compatible with active EHV-1 infection and the private practitioners for both barns are very involved.

It is important to note that at the present time, there have been no deaths associated with this situation.

As we have in the past few years of EHM situations, we are responding to this situation based on a science based protocol involving minimum quarantine of 21 days from the last significant clinical finding (e.g. fever) as well as the use of PCR testing for EHV-1 when appropriate.

Please help us to correct any misinformation out there related to this issue and, as always, please remind equestrian clients of some of the biosecurity practices they can utilize to mitigate the risks inherent in showing. The AAEP [American Association of Equine Practitioners] website has some excellent resources available on the public portion of their website: http://www.aaep.org/info/equine-herpesvirus-resources.

As a reminder, neuropathogenic EHV-1 is reportable to PDA ON SUSPICION. That means that even if you do not have confirmatory test results, if you are suspicious of this disease in a patient, you must report it to us right away. We can then post a quarantine for the premises to make sure that no equine animals leave while we await test results.

Also, we frequently encounter confusion about what samples should be submitted for EHV diagnosis from a live animal. Please submit 15-20 cc of blood in lavender top tubes (EDTA) AND submit swab samples of the nasal mucosa in dry sterile containers (most commonly empty plain red top tubes). The swabs used should be polyester (Dacron) swabs with plastic shafts. After vigorously swabbing both nostrils, you then break off most of the shaft and let the swab drop into the red top tube or other sterile container. Both the blood samples and swab samples should be transported chilled to the laboratory quickly to ensure accurate results. Please make sure to indicate on the submission forms that these samples are a priority as they are related to a clinical case.

For more information on this and other laboratory testing, please go to the laboratory system website at http://www.padls.org. If you are going to be euthanizing a neuro-EHV suspect patient, please take the blood and nasal swab samples before death as the diagnosis is much quicker from these samples than from the post-mortem tissue samples. If you wish to submit EHV samples for testing at an out of state lab, please contact that lab before you are in a testing situation to make sure that you have the appropriate supplies and paperwork and are familiar with the procedures of that lab.

Thank you for your continued vigilance at identifying cases of reportable diseases and your assistance with rumor control in the equestrian community.
