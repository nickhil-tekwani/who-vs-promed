Alcona County [Michigan] Beef Herd Tests Positive for Bovine Tuberculosis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
An investigation found a herd of cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis.

The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development says a medium sized beef herd has tested positive for bovine TB in Alcona County.

Bovine TB is regularly found in free-ranging white-tailed deer in Alcona County.

This is now the 65th cattle herd in Michigan found with the disease.

Bovine TB affects cattle and can spread between wildlife and other animals, including humans.

There is now an informational meeting for beef and dairy cattle producers in Alcona County on 24 May 2016 at 7 p.m. at the Mitchell Township Hall in Curran.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymphnode enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
