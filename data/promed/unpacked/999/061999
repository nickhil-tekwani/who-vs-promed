The director of the Victoria Hospital, Joaquin Sanzana Munoz,
yesterday [2 Jan 2012] confirmed to Las Noticias in Malleco the deaths
of 2 people, victims of [a] hantavirus [infection].

The director said that the 1st case, reported promptly to this
newspaper, relates to a young 27-year-old man, resident of Curacautin
who had come form the Lago Conguillio area; he received initial
medical attention in the assistance center and later, due to his
serious condition, was sent to the ICU of the Hospital "Guillermo
Grant Benavente" in Concepcion, and died en route.

The 2nd [case] corresponds to a 50-year-old person, native of Icalma,
who was admitted to the Victoria Hospital at noon of Saturday, 31 Dec
[2011], and died on 1 Jan [2012], victim of the virus.

Dr Sanzana said that given the summer conditions, it is recommended
that those who visit places or houses that are little used, make sure
that these habitations are aired out. This is the way to avoid
infection, said the physician, noting also that when installing tents
in recreational areas, to clean up the environment. "Rat feces
[contaminated with a virus] that is inhaled causes the disease
[transmits the virus], [with initial symptoms] similar to a cold, so
it is recommended that [an ill individual] go to a medical
professional, when there is a suspicion [of a hantavirus infection]."

A 24 year-old young man from the Mulchen commune [smallest
administrative subdivision in Chile] was admitted into the intensive
care unit of the Hospital Base de Los Angeles, where he remains in
serious condition due to [a] hantavirus [infection]. The patient is
stable although in serious condition, and is connected to a mechanical
ventilator.

The health authority is working to establish the place where the virus
infection took place, and is carrying out related tests on the rest of
his family group. [Andes virus is the only hantavirus know to be
transmitted directly from person to person, although this transmission
requires close physical contact, usually between family members.
Hence, the followup with family members in this case. - Mod.TY]
