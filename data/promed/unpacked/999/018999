The USDA Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory has confirmed rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in a feral domestic rabbit collected in La Pine, Oregon, on [9 Apr 2021]. While the virus is highly contagious among rabbit populations and can spread through contact with infected rabbits, it poses no human health risk. The virus is only known to infect rabbits and hares.

This confirmation comes a few weeks after the same virus, RHDV2, was found in a feral domestic rabbit found dead in Milwaukie, a suburb of Portland.

RHD is a viral disease that causes sudden death in rabbits. It is resistant to extreme temperatures and can survive in the environment for months under certain conditions. The virus spreads through direct contact between infected and susceptible live rabbits or exposure to contaminated materials (carcasses, pelts, food, water, forage, etc.). Birds, rodents, flies, predators, and scavengers can spread this virus via their feet, fur/feathers, or feces without becoming infected themselves. People can spread the virus indirectly by carrying it on their clothing, hands, and shoes.

The Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA) and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) is asking the public to voluntarily stop the transport of rabbits at this time. The releasing of a pet or domestically raised rabbit and allowing them to wander uncaged in neighborhoods or in the wild is unlawful (ORS 498.0520) and could further spread disease to wild rabbits and significantly impact wildlife rabbit and hare populations. Oregon is unique in the diversity of rabbit and hare species and habitats these populations occupy (https://myodfw.com/wildlife-viewing/species/pikas-rabbits-and-hares). However, 3 species have particularly vulnerable populations and are identified as Oregon Conservation Strategy Species.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (<2 months old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia. - Mod.PMB
