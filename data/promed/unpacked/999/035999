Gastritis claims 4 more lives in Sui
-------------------------------------
4 more children died from gastritis in the adjoining areas of Sui on Fri 21
Jan 2005, raising the number of deaths from the disease to 6 over the last
48 hours. Many people have become sick after drinking contaminated water in
Sui.
A doctor told Online that harmful toxins were mixed with drinking water in
the Sui area. He said that more than 40 people, most of whom are children,
had been admitted to Sui hospital and that an emergency had been declared
in the hospital.

[Sui is located in the province of Baluchistan, the largest but most
sparely populated province in Pakistan. In the northeast area of Pakistan,
it borders both Iran and Afghanistan.
ProMED would like more information regarding this episode. There is no
indication of the length of time from ingestion of water (the alleged
vehicle) until symptoms began, how many individuals were affected or how
long the illness in non-fatal cases lasted. Bacterial disease pre-formed
toxins, including those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Bacillus cereus_,
can cause emesis. Drugs and toxins can also be suspected, including those
related to local stimulation of emesis (such as strong detergents, heavy
metals, solvents and fluoride), or from central chemoreceptor effects (such
as nicotine and cardiac glycosides), or from a mixture of both (such as
caffeine). - Mod.LL]
