[1] Vaccine development
Date: Mon 5 Sep 2022

https://fortune.com/2022/09/05/cansino-china-worlds-first-inhaled-vaccine-omicron/


China's government approved the world's 1st inhaled vaccine against COVID-19, the vaccine's maker CanSino Biologics announced on Sunday [4 Sep 2022].

The vaccine, called Convidecia Air, changes the liquid form of the vaccine into an aerosol using a nebulizer. The vaccine can then be inhaled through the mouth using the nebulizer machine. The needle-free vaccine "can effectively induce comprehensive immune protection in response to SARS-CoV-2 after just one breath," CanSino said in a statement. The science appears to back CanSino's claims.

In July [2022], Chinese scientists published a pre-print study showing that people who received one booster dose of CanSino's inhaled vaccine after 2 doses of the inactivated jab from Chinese maker Sinovac developed more antibodies than people who received 3 Sinovac shots. Four weeks after receiving the inhaled booster, 92.5% of people had developed neutralizing antibodies for omicron. [Lairun Jin, Rong Tang, Shipo Wu, et al. Antibody Persistence and Safety through 6 Months after Heterologous Orally Aerosolised Ad5-nCoV in individuals primed with two-dose CoronaVac previously. MedRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.26.22278072 posted 28 Jul 2022]

Those who got 3 doses on Sinovac's jab did not demonstrate any neutralizing antibodies for omicron, either 4 weeks or 6 months after getting a booster.

U.S. vaccine push
-----------------
Prominent scientists like Scripps Research executive vice president Eric Topol have called on the U.S. government to accelerate efforts to develop inhaled and nasal spray vaccines, believing that they may better target omicron infections than injected jabs.

"Once [omicron] gets in through our nasal mucosa, or our oral mucosa, upper airway. That's game over [for] infection," Topol said recently in a podcast with U.S. President Joe Biden's former COVID-19 Response Coordinator Andy Slavitt. "The best way... to induce the mucosal immunity right at the upper airway is with either nasal or oral vaccines.

CanSino's booster vaccine is an inhaled version of the one-shot, adenovirus COVID-19 jab that CanSino developed in partnership with the Chinese military-run Academy of Military Medical Sciences. The initial jab proved 66% effective in preventing infection, and 92% effective against severe disease in early clinical trials. It has been green-lit for use as a booster and primary vaccine dose by the Chinese government, World Health Organization, and several other countries.

But CanSino's jab has not been as widely distributed as initially expected. The firm led the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine early in the pandemic, ahead of foreign makers like Pfizer and Moderna and Chinese firms Sinovac and Sinopharm, but then fell behind in approval and distribution. ...

Over the weekend, China's government approved another new protein-based jab -- from local firm Livzon Pharma -- for use as a booster.

Unclear prospects
-----------------
It's unclear how widely CanSino or Livzon's vaccines will be distributed or how useful the new jabs will prove in China's fight against COVID-19, given that the market appears largely saturated.

China has already distributed over 3.4 billion doses to its citizens, providing 2 or more jabs to 89.7% of its population. By comparison, 66.8% of people in the U.S. have gotten 2 or more COVID-19 shots.

Despite China's successful vaccination campaign, as well as mounting popular unrest and economic pressures, the government also has not deviated from a strict zero COVID policy and continues to use strict lockdowns, border restrictions, and mass testing measures to stamp out all cases of the virus. That means that Chinese citizens may feel little incentive to seek out a new vaccine, given that China's government has not provided a concrete timeline for transitioning to a 'living with COVID' strategy like virtually every other country in the world.

Chengdu, a city of 21 million people in central China, implemented a citywide stay-at-home since last Thursday [1 Sep 2022] amid a local flareup of a few hundred cases. In total, there are 65 million people in China living under partial or complete lockdown, according to Chinese outlet Caixin.

[Having a needleless vaccine that protects against air-borne infectious virus would be a big step forward. India [Bharat] has also produced a nasal vaccine that uses nose drops.

"These mucosal vaccines target thin mucous membranes that line the nose, mouth and lungs. By prompting immune responses where SARS-CoV-2 first enters the body, mucosal vaccines could, in theory, prevent even mild cases of illness and block transmission to other people -- something COVID-19 shots have been unable to do. Vaccines that produce sterilizing immunity would be game changing for the pandemic. ...

Bharat compared its intranasal vaccine to Covaxin, a COVID-19 jab available in India, by measuring antibody levels in the blood. The company did not release results of this study, but deemed the trial "successful".

Exactly how successful these vaccines will be is unclear. Expecting a vaccine to stop transmission of a virus or prevent even mild illness -- achieving what is called sterilizing immunity -- is a high bar. Bharat and CanSino won't know whether their vaccines can achieve this until they have conducted further efficacy studies.

Scant data is available on the efficacy of the 2 other mucosal COVID-19 vaccines. Iran approved a COVID-19 vaccine administered as a nasal spray and made by Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute in Karaj, in October 2021. More than 5000 doses have been delivered to the public. And Russia's health ministry is reported to have approved an intranasal spray version of Sputnik V, the country's injected COVID-19 vaccine.

Mucosal vaccines have been developed for other diseases, including poliovirus, influenza and cholera. Most of these vaccines are taken orally, and one, against flu, is administered through the nose." (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02851-0) - Mod.LK]

Russia recorded 50 952 new COVID-19 infections over the last 24 hours, the government's coronavirus task force said on Friday [2 Sep 2022], the highest daily tally in almost 6 months.

Case numbers have climbed across Russia over the last 6 weeks, fuelled by the spread of new highly-transmissible variants of the coronavirus.

Fridays's [2 Sep 2022] tally was the highest number of new cases reported in a 24-hour period since [10 Mar 2022].

Russia was one of the countries most severely affected by the pandemic based on the number of excess fatalities, as the Kremlin largely shunned strict restrictions following a short lockdown in April 2020, while vaccine uptake was slow.

Study: Most COVID survivors had cardiac involvement nearly 1 year later
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A study of 346 previously healthy COVID-19 survivors finds that 73% had cardiac signs and symptoms more than 3 months after infection, and 57% still had them at nearly 1 year.

In the study, published yesterday {5 Sep 2022] in Nature Medicine, a team led by University Hospital Frankfurt researchers in Germany measured blood biomarkers of heart injury and dysfunction and performed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on 346 COVID-19 survivors who had no previous heart disease or notable chronic conditions at a median of 109 and 329 days.

The 1st screening took place from April 2020 to October 2021. Average participant age was 43.3 years, and 52% were women. A total of 144 participants (42%) received mRNA COVID-19 vaccination from baseline to follow-up, but the effects of vaccination weren't systematically assessed.

At 109 days, 73% of participants noted cardiac symptoms such as shortness of breath during exertion (62%), palpitations (28%), chest pain (27%), and fainting (3%). Participants who had symptomatic COVID-19 infections had higher heart rates and signs of heart inflammation on MRI than asymptomatic patients, but structural heart disease and biomarkers of heart injury or dysfunction were rare in symptomatic patients.

Of all participants, 38% had mild cardiac symptoms, while 33% reported moderate symptoms, and 3% had severe symptoms that resulted in the inability to leave home owing to sudden general weakness, dizziness, and blackouts.

At a median of 329 days, 57% of participants reported cardiac symptoms, including 5% who developed new cardiac symptoms since baseline. Those reporting cardiac symptoms had more evidence of diffuse myocardial edema than those without cardiac symptoms. Women were significantly more likely than men to have lingering cardiac symptoms (67% vs 46%).

"Ongoing inflammatory cardiac involvement may, at least in part, explain the lingering cardiac symptoms in previously well individuals with mild initial COVID-19 illness," the researchers wrote.

Abstract
--------
Cardiac symptoms are increasingly recognized as late complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in previously well individuals with mild initial illness, but the underlying pathophysiology leading to long-term cardiac symptoms remains unclear. In this study, we conducted serial cardiac assessments in a selected population of individuals with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) with no previous cardiac disease or notable comorbidities by measuring blood biomarkers of heart injury or dysfunction and by performing magnetic resonance imaging. Baseline measurements from 346 individuals with COVID-19 (52% females) were obtained at a median of 109 days (interquartile range (IQR), 77-177 days) after infection, when 73% of participants reported cardiac symptoms, such as exertional dyspnea (62%), palpitations (28%), atypical chest pain (27%) and syncope (3%). Symptomatic individuals had higher heart rates and higher imaging values or contrast agent accumulation, denoting inflammatory cardiac involvement, compared to asymptomatic individuals. Structural heart disease or high levels of biomarkers of cardiac injury or dysfunction were rare in symptomatic individuals. At follow-up (329 days (IQR, 274-383 days) after infection), 57% of participants had persistent cardiac symptoms. Diffuse myocardial edema was more pronounced in participants who remained symptomatic at follow-up as compared to those who improved. Female gender and diffuse myocardial involvement on baseline imaging independently predicted the presence of cardiac symptoms at follow-up. Ongoing inflammatory cardiac involvement may, at least in part, explain the lingering cardiac symptoms in previously well individuals with mild initial COVID-19 illness.

Discussion
----------
... in the present cohort of individuals with mild initial COVID-19 illness, cardiac symptoms were related to subclinical inflammatory cardiac involvement, which may, at least in part, explain the pathophysiological background of persistent cardiac symptoms. Notably, profound myocardial injury or structural heart disease is not prerequisite for the presence of symptoms defying the classical definitions of viral myocarditis. Subclinical cardiovascular inflammation is increasingly recognized as a risk factor in chronic autoimmune systemic conditions, necessitating further research to establish long-term outcome in the context of post-COVID.]

[B] Mobile app detects COVID-19 infection in people's voices

A mobile smartphone app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately detect COVID-19 infections in people's voices, according to research presented this week at the European Respiratory Society International Congress in Barcelona, Spain.

The developers of the app said the program detected infections with more accuracy than lateral flow or rapid antigen tests, and is cheaper than a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The app was accurate in detecting infection 89% of the time.

"These promising results suggest that simple voice recordings and fine-tuned AI algorithms can potentially achieve high precision in determining which patients have COVID-19 infection," said Wafaa Aljbawi, a researcher at the Institute of Data Science, Maastricht University, the Netherlands, in a European Lung Foundation press release. "Such tests can be provided at no cost and are simple to interpret. Moreover, they enable remote, virtual testing and have a turnaround time of less than a minute."

The researchers used different artificial intelligence models to classify voices, patterns of speech, power, and variation over time in audio samples collected by the University of Cambridge, which included recordings from 4352 healthy and non-healthy participants, 308 of whom had tested positive for COVID-19.

Participants provided several audio samples, which included coughing, reading a short sentence, and breathing deeply through the mouth.

The best performing model was called the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Using that model, researchers were able to correctly identify true positives 89% of the times, and true negatives 83% of the time.

Lateral flow tests, or home rapid antigen tests, have a sensitivity of only 56%, Aljbawi said, which means more true positives may be missed.

[European Lung Foundation press release (4 Sep 2022): https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/963516

... COVID-19 infection usually affects the upper respiratory track and vocal cords, leading to changes in a person's voice.

... The researchers say that their results need to be validated with large numbers. Since the start of this project, 53 449 audio samples from 36 116 participants have now been collected and can be used to improve and validate the accuracy of the model. They are also carrying out further analysis to understand which parameters in the voice are influencing the AI model.]

The omicron BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 subvariant predominance remained high last week, making up 88.6% of sequenced samples, down just a hair from 88.7% the previous week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today [6 Sep 2022] in its latest update. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions]

Meanwhile, over the past week the proportion of the BA.4.6 omicron subvariant rose from 7.5% to 8.4% of samples. The proportions of BA.4.6 are still highest in the southern tier of Midwestern states, where it accounts for 17.8% of samples.

The 7-day average for new daily cases continues to decline, and at 77 316 is at its lowest level since early May [2022], according to the Washington Post tracker, which said cases over the past week are down 12%, with a 9% decline in hospitalizations. Deaths remain steady.

In the wake of last week's emergency use approval of and recommendation for updated boosters from Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, 2 of the nation's major pharmacy chains -- Walgreens and CVS -- announced that customers can book online appointments as they begin receiving their supplies.

In international developments, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) today [6 Sep 2022] issued guidance on the use of updated COVID boosters, which urges that people at higher risk of complications be prioritized, including those age 60 and older, those who have weakened immune systems, and people with underlying health conditions.

Elsewhere, cities in China are still battling rises in local COVID activity, with Shenzhen ending a brief lockdown and officials in Chengdu extending its lockdown, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-shenzhen-eases-weekend-covid-lockdown-some-curbs-remain-2022-09-05/]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Immune responses at the respiratory mucosal interface are critical to prevent respiratory infections but it is unclear to what extent antigen specific mucosal secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies are induced by mRNA vaccination in humans. Here we analyze paired serum and saliva samples from patients with and without prior coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at multiple time points pre and post severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mRNA vaccination. Our results suggest mucosal SIgA responses induced by mRNA vaccination are impacted by pre-existing immunity. Indeed, vaccination induced a minimal mucosal SIgA response in individuals without pre-exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while SIgA induction after vaccination was more efficient in patients with a history of COVID-19.
