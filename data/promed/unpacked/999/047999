A comment re: Mumps - UK (03): (England) 20090211.0619
-----------------------------------------------
The moderator's comment that this is "Another consequence of the less than
optimal uptake of MMR vaccine in the UK" needs to be challenged. That may
be a part of the problem, but there are 2 other significant factors here,
and it would be wrong to overstate the case. (The mumps epidemic has been
cited by some of those engaged with anti-vaccinationists as evidence of the
harm caused by vaccine scares; anti-vaccinationists could claim that this
is a false argument to undermine the strength of the case against them.)

The 1st, and probably most important, factor is that there is a cohort of
people who had a single dose of MMR (single-component mumps vaccine has
never been licensed or widely used in the UK) before the introduction of a
2nd dose with the "pre-school booster vaccinations" in October 1996. Many
of these will have had an MR vaccine during a programme implemented in
schools; but there was insufficient mumps vaccine available at the time to
use MMR for this programme. In Mary Ramsay's words (in an internal Health
Protection Agency document; I'm not sure whether a version was published):
"The cohort identified to be at particularly high risk of mumps were those
who are too old to have received 2 doses of MMR in the routine schedule
(born before 1992) but young enough to have grown up during a period of low
incidence and so to have escaped catching mumps as a child."[1]

The 2nd factor is that the duration of effective immunity following mumps
vaccination is lower than for measles and rubella.[2]

[2] Mumps - UK: (Wales)

An investigation has been launched into a 2nd outbreak of mumps in Wales.
Public health experts are investigating 6 cases of suspected mumps in
Swansea. And there have been a further 31 cases of the illness -- 2
confirmed and 29 suspected -- in Anglesey and Gwynedd since 27 Dec 2009. No
links between the 2 outbreaks have been established, but it is thought that
a number of the cases are in children and young people who have previously
received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine.

Swansea became the heartland of the MMR backlash in Wales following claims
in 1998 that the jab was linked to autism and bowel disease. The MMR uptake
rate is now improving. The National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS)
has urged any teenagers or young adults who have not had both doses of the
triple vaccine to ensure they are immunised against measles, mumps and
rubella. Dr Hoffmann, a consultant in communicable disease control for the
NPHS, said: "The MMR vaccine is extremely effective in protecting against
measles and rubella, with 99 per cent of those who have received 2 doses
protected for many years. One dose of MMR protects around 65 per cent of
those who receive it against mumps, with a 2nd dose of MMR improving
immunity to around 85 per cent of recipients. So it is possible to see
mumps in individuals who have been vaccinated with MMR, although this is
not common."

In the North Wales outbreak, at least 26 of the people who have developed
mumps had previously received the recommended 2 doses of MMR. Dr Judy Hart,
a consultant in communicable disease control for the NPHS, said: "MMR
uptake is very high on Anglesey, so most school children are protected.
However, young people aged 16 and over were too old to have received a
routine 2nd dose of MMR before school entry when it was introduced in 1996.
They are more likely to be susceptible to mumps, as it is spread by coughs
and sneezes and directly through close personal contact. Symptoms include
swelling on the angle of the jaw on one or both sides of the face. This may
be preceded by several days of general symptoms such as fever, headache,
tiredness, muscle aches, and loss of appetite."

The NPHS is advising that anyone with mumps symptoms should see their GP or
family doctor and stay away from school or work until 5 days after the
start of the swelling, when they are no longer infectious.
