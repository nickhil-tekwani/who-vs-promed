Foot-and-mouth disease, Mongolia
--------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 19 Jan 2011 from Dr Batsukh
Zayat, deputy director, Veterinary and Animal Breeding Agency,
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia

Summary
Report type: follow-up report no 7 (final report)
Start date: 26 Aug 2010
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 29 Aug 2010
Report date: 19 Jan 2011
Date submitted to OIE: 19 Jan 2011
Date event resolved: 5 Jan 2011
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2009
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: O
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

Outbreaks: There are no new outbreaks in this report

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: the Government of Mongolia fully controlled
movement of animals and animal products in the country, quarantine,
screening, modified stamping out, and vaccination in response to the
outbreaks. A total of 25 914 livestock has been destroyed, out of
which 17 230 in Sukhbaatar province, 7390 in Dornod province, 191 in
Khentii province, 1030 in Tuv province, and 73 in Govisumber province
(100 percent culling of infected livestock).

There is considerable local concern about the potential role of
Mongolian gazelles (_Procapra gutturosa_) in the disease transmission.
- In total, 917 gazelles with clinical signs of FMD such as illness,
lameness, and chest [see comment below] and foot lesions were
observed. These 917 gazelles were hunted and carcasses were
disinfected and buried. These animals were severely affected and
unable to maintain contact with the herd or survive the illness.
Slaughter of these may be regarded as having a welfare purpose. The
diagnosis was confirmed by the OIE Reference Laboratory, the
Pirbright Laboratory (United Kingdom). The National State Central
Veterinary Laboratory submitted 4 samples to the Pirbright
Laboratory. 2 serological samples from gazelles showed negative
results by ELISA and PCR tests on 25 Nov 2010. But 2 samples from
gazelle epithelium were found infected with FMD virus by PCR and O
serotyping was confirmed by cell culture/ELISA test on 25 Nov 2010.
- At the same time, 688 carcasses of gazelles that died for unknown
reasons were collected and destroyed along with the above mentioned
917 sick gazelles.

Control measures
Measures applied: Quarantine, movement control inside the country,
screening, vaccination [in response to the outbreak; see details of

[The FMD epizootic above started, reportedly, on 26 Aug 2010 and was
resolved on 5 Jan 2011. A summary including the 8 relevant OIE
reports and an interactive map is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9653>.
The reporting coverage of this epizootic, in contrast with previous,
exemplary reporting from Mongolia, was sparse.

During the lengthy event, clinical cases and mortalities were
recorded in cattle, sheep, goats, camels (Bactrian=bi-humped) and
gazelles. This demonstrates the wide-spectrum and the high
pathogenicity of the virus strain involved, identified by WRLFMD as
serotype O, topotype SEA, strain Mya-98 (for the genotyping report
addressing samples from 7 cattle and one gazelle, see
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-00033%20O%20Mongolia%202010.pdf>).
Similar strains have been circulating during 2010 in Japan, South
Korea, Russia, Hong Kong, and, most probably, mainland China.

The Mongolian epizootic was, eventually, controlled by the
application of quarantine measures, mass-vaccinations, and "modified
stamping out" (culling selectively infected/suspected animals).

The involvement of wildlife (gazelles), as commendably described in
the epidemiological comments above, is of particular interest.

FMD in Mongolian wildlife has been reported several times throughout
the years, including an outbreak in unspecified animals (antelopes?)
in 2004 (see ProMED-mail no 20040219.0540).

In February 2010, mass mortality was reported in wild antelopes in
Russia's Zabaykalsky krai, bordering Mongolia; FMD was suspected, but
no confirmation has become available. Allegedly, the animals had
migrated from Mongolia (see ProMED-mail no 20100202.0354). At that
time the disease was not yet identified within Mongolia and mass
mortalities there were attributed to climatic conditions. Later, FMD
was diagnosed in the gazelles and reported to OIE (follow-up report 1
of 11 Sep 2010). Reportedly, 442 deaths were reported from a
population of 1044 susceptible animals. This demonstrates the
invasiveness and pathogenicity of this FMDV strain.

FMD outbreaks in antelopes of several species, in some cases
characterised by high mortalities, have been recorded in the past in
several geographical locations, mainly in Africa and Asia. One such
outbreak, affecting the Saigak (Saiga) antelope, was reported from
Kazakhstan during the late 1960s. The disease spread along the
long-distance north-south annual migration route of the animals, at
that time counting several hundred thousand. Among the signs observed
were the loss of horns and hooves and considerable mortality
(Kindyakov, Nagumanov, et al (1970); Veterinariya 47, 52). A similar
event was reported in Israel in 1985, affecting the mountain gazelle
(_Gazella gazella_). - Mod.AS]
