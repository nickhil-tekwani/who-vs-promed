New rice virus disease spreading in China
-----------------------------------------
The new virus called Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus
(SRBSDV) discovered in 2001 in Yangxi county, Guangdong province near
the coast appears to be spreading in China. The virus has [also]
spread to numerous provinces in northern Viet Nam [ProMED-mail post
20100506.1473], and in China the virus is found on maize as far north
as Shandong province. In total about 300 000 ha rice covering 9
provinces of China have been infected and in Viet Nam about 15 000 ha
[37 000 acres] covering [more than] 19 provinces were infected. More
than 6500 ha [16 000 acres] have suffered total crop failure.

Disease symptoms vary depending on the crop age. When infected in the
seedling stage, plants are dwarfed with stiff leaves and may die; in
the tillering stages, plants are dwarfed and show witches broom
symptoms [abnormal clusters of multiple small shoots - Mod.DHA]; at
the stem elongation stage, infected plants show [excessive] branching
with [formation of] upward rootlets at the nodes and small waxy
swellings, or galls, on the stems. Infected plants produce abnormal
panicles. We found that the virus is mainly transmitted by the white
back planthopper (WBPH). The small brown planthopper (SBPH) was also
able to transmit the virus but inefficiently. The brown planthopper
(BPH) [_Nilaparvata lugens_, vector of several other rice viruses -
Mod.DHA] seems unable to successfully transmit the virus.

The virus also infects maize, _Echinochloa_, _Juncellus_, and
_Pennisetum_ [wild grass species - Mod.DHA] and Chinese sorghum
[varieties]. A recent survey showed that infection rates in
Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan had increased. The summer crops
transplanted and using hybrid rice varieties were more seriously affected.

[Black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice due to _Rice black
streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) is known to cause
serious crop losses in South East Asia. It also affects some other
graminaceous hosts including maize, wheat, oat, and barley and is
spread by planthoppers including the small brown planthopper (SBPH;
_Laodelphax striatellus_) and _Unkanodes_ species.

Recently, the spread of a new virus associated with BSDD symptoms,
but transmitted by the white backed planthopper (WBPH; _Sogatella
furcifera_), which is not a vector of RBSDV, was reported from
southern China and northern Viet Nam. The new virus has been
tentatively named Southern rice black streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV).
RBSDV and the closely related _Maize rough dwarf virus_ (MRDV) have
both been classed into the serogroup 2 of _Fijivirus_, and SRBSDV
appears to belong to the same group.

Disease management for rice viruses may include cultural practices,
vector control, and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus,
the vector, or both. Since genetic resistance against SRBSDV has not
yet been identified, insecticide sprays against the vectors currently
appear the best option.

The new SRBSDV and an increase in WBPH numbers are a major concern in
the region where the rice crop is already frequently affected by
other viruses and their insect vectors. An additional secondary
SRBSDV vector (SBPH) as well as maize, sorghum (_Sorghum bicolor_)
and several grasses as additional crop or reservoir hosts, which are
reported above, further increase the risk to production of rice and
the other susceptible cereals.
