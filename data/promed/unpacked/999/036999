Colorado State University is one of the nation's premiere land-grant teaching and research universities with a total enrollment of over 30 000. The University consistently has been ranked as a top tier institution by US News and World Report's "America's Best Colleges and Universities" and named by Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine as one of the top public universities in terms of educational quality and affordability. Nestled at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills, the campus is located in Fort Collins, a city of approximately 150 000, 65 miles [105 km] north of Denver. Fort Collins provides a unique blend of big city advantages and small town friendliness, making it an attractive and great place to live. CSU consists of 8 colleges and more than 50 academic departments with the mission to provide a balanced program of teaching, research, extension, and public service. CSU provides national leadership in many disciplines, including veterinary medicine, human health, agriculture, environment, energy, and water -- all topics relevant to Global One Health. Further, Fort Collins is home to numerous Federal and State Agencies, providing an outstanding opportunity to bridge synergies between government entities and academia.

All 8 CSU colleges, local and federal agencies, and industrial partners, among others, have been involved in developing a University wide "One Health" Footprint over the past 18 months. This has included formation of a planning committee, several One Health Institute retreats, and presentations at local, national, and international One Health colloquia. Tangible outcomes have been the initiation of a One Health Dinner Series featuring national and local speakers and networking opportunities, Initiation of a Seed Grant Program, and defining the scope of One Health related issues at Colorado State University. Areas of strength among participants include disease emergence, food safety and security issues, impacts of new technologies on human and animal health, optimization of health through development by design, and impacts of environmental residue on ecosystem health. While initiated by the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, the One Health initiative has grown to encompass partners across the University, locally and globally.

Position description
Director, One Health Institute, Colorado State University
---------------------------------------------------------
The One Health Institute Director is a full-time, 12-month administrative professional leadership position that has dual reporting lines to the Colorado State University Vice President of Research and Dean of College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (CVMBS). The Director may select to have a faculty appointment in an appropriate college and department. Desire to maintain an active research program will be considered but is not required. We seek an established leader with working knowledge of the One Health concept who is committed to collaboration, networking, and team building. CSU's Colleges of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Agriculture Science, Health and Human Sciences, Natural Resources, Engineering, and Natural Sciences, along with Schools of Global and Environmental Sustainability (SoGES) and Public Health, provide a fertile basis for development of change making programs in One Health -- that is, collaborative and interdisciplinary studies in human, animal, and environmental health. Colleges of Business, Liberal Arts, and Engineering round out the capacity to develop and implement real world solutions for current and future global issues. A large number of state and federal governmental agencies, including CDC, USDA APHIS [Animal Plant Health Inspection Service ], USDA NWRC [National Wildlife Research Center], NPS [National Park Service], USGS [US Geological Survey], Colorado Parks and Wildlife, and others are located in the Northern Colorado area, providing an internationally unique opportunity to develop large collaborative programs of real global strength and significance. Nongovernmental stakeholders, including industry/producer groups, are also key constituents in this endeavor.

This newly created position will be responsible for developing the nascent One Health initiative at CSU into an internationally recognized institute. This will include developing strategic partnerships, alliances, and collaborations both on and off-campus; developing internal and external advisory boards; coordinate activities across campus and community; taking responsibility for representing the University through networking and professional collaboration with external constituents, industry stakeholders, schools, and organizations; and developing resources for programmatic growth and sustainability.
