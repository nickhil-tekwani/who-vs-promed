A 2-member team from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) today [28 Oct 2014] confirmed an anthrax outbreak in Kuruchdega village, Simdega, based on earlier RIMS pathological test reports and on-the-spot findings. Though an expert team of the state health department had visited the area last week following reports of mysterious deaths of 7 villagers, it had been waiting for the NCDC's formal confirmation.

Dr Shah Hussain, outbreak mentor of NCDC, reached Kuruchdega village on Sunday [26 Oct 2014], while his colleague Dr Priya Kant joined him this morning [28 Oct 2014]. State integrated disease surveillance programme officials said that the team would spend a few weeks in the area for further investigations.

Dr Ramesh Prasad, director of the state integrated surveillance wing, said: "According to our daily updates, things are completely under control. There is no need to worry. The only thing we must ensure is sustained treatment for victims."

At Kuruchdega, after the 7 deaths focused media attention, 10 other persons who displayed "puzzling symptoms" finally received correct treatment and are on their way to recovery.

Anthrax, a potentially lethal disease, is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Spreading through spores, it infects cattle through grazing and transfers to humans via touch, blood or flesh. Symptoms include cold and flu that escalate to pneumonia and respiratory collapse, and more rarely, severe gastro-intestinal disorders. Ambiguous symptoms can delay diagnosis.

Simdega civil surgeon A.D.N. Prasad said they were now working on a "sort of quarantine" to prevent the disease from spreading. "Technically, one can't quarantine a village, as the mobility of humans or for that matter cattle can't be tracked and restricted 24/7," he conceded, but added they were currently working out some modalities. From 22-23 Oct 2014 onwards, 2 antibiotics -- Ciprofloxacin and Doxycycline -- have been distributed to all villagers, including those undergoing treatment, as a precaution. "A team of 4 healthcare personnel, including doctors and ANMs, is keeping daily tabs," he said.

[This report reveals a number of aspects of this disease in India. Firstly, the medical profession lacks experience with it, whether in diagnosis or its basic epidemiology. They appear to regard it as a contagious disease. It is infectious, but contagion is very rare. Therefore, any suspect human case with a fever will respond very well to appropriate antibiotic treatment. And one does not quarantine the human population; you vaccinate the village cattle, and the sheep and goats if there is any evidence of exposure and restrict any livestock movement in or out of the village for 10 days. And to get the villagers' cooperation, you include them in the planning and control activities, along with a quiet word with the village policeman. And it would be a good idea if the medical services developed a professional interaction and relationship with the provincial veterinary service. Anthrax is primarily a livestock, and thus veterinary, problem, which can and does spill over into the human population. If you control it in the livestock, you do not see any human cases, period.
