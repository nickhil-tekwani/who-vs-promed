70 People Affected by Mysterious Illness in Costa Rica
------------------------------------------------------
SAN JOSE: At least 70 people have been infected with an unknown virus in
Costa Rica in 2 weeks, Minister of Health Xiania Carvajal said on Wed 11
Apr 2001. Symptoms of the illness are high fever and joint pain, but the
virus does not cause hemorrhage like dengue fever and is not lethal in
general, Carvajal said. The disease heals by itself, Carvajal said, adding
that there are drugs to cure [treat ?] it at the moment. [There is no
information in this report to implicate a virus, rather than some other
infectious agent, as the cause of this outbreak of disease. - Mod.CP]
The first cases were found during December 2000 in the north of the
country, and then similar cases occurred in areas along the Atlantic coast.
Doctors had tested the patients for dengue fever, German measles, measles,
and other [?] diseases, but all the results were negative. [Samples from
recent cases have now been] sent to laboratories in Mexico and results
could be available in 2 weeks.

[The differential diagnosis of a febrile illness associated with arthralgia
as stated in this newswire is rather extensive. As the article mentions
testing for dengue fever, measles, and rubella, it also suggests the
presence of a rash, still leaving a rather extensive differential
diagnosis. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving more information on this
outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
