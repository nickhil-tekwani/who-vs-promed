[1] What to watch for with omicron

@JeremyFarrar on Twitter:
As a new variant, many issues to resolve amid uncertainty. Having great public health & science people, teams, infrastructure, and close links into informed policymakers committed to sharing evidence is crucial. Fortunately, all that is true in South Africa. They need all our support.

Many things to learn & watch for - a non-exhaustive list:

1. The epidemiology (Is transmission increasing? Is its geographic footprint widening? Are there secondary cases distant from the original epicentre? Is the infectious period the same? Infectiousness, viral load, etc.)

2. Clinical (Is the clinical syndrome changing? Illness severity, demographic, illness/hospitalised in those previously infected or vaccinated, response to therapy, time in hospital, need for critical care, etc.)

3. Laboratory (Are the biological characteristics of the variant different? Affinity for receptor, different receptors, growth rate in lab, neutralisation with immune sera, T and B cell epitopes, structural biology changes, etc.)

4. Interventions (Do existing public health measures still work? Do existing vaccines continue to prevent infection/illness/severity? Development & capacity to manufacture & distribute new vaccines if needed? Do tests still diagnose? Do existing treatments work? etc.)

5. Communications (Clear, trusted, considered, transparent, calm). Undertake what public health, clinical & lab work that needs to be done - calmly, painstakingly, and transparently.

6. Pending results use existing classic public health & clinical measures that we know work: test, reduce & stop chains transmission, PPE, O2, equitable access treatments. Vaccination access globally to protect people getting ill & help reduce transmission. Enlightened self-interest.

7. New variants are inevitable; the virus remains highly plastic - still evolving & will continue to do so. New variants are not a reason to stop doing what we know works.

8. New variants are a reminder -- if we needed it -- that the pandemic is far from over; inequity is what will extend the pandemic. We do need to do inclusive public health better, including urgent equitable access to vaccines & all the tools needed stop pandemic.

9. Only way to stop new variants is to stop pandemic, reduce transmission, prevent illness, save lives, education, economies, trade, with equitable access vaccines, tests, treatments, PPE & O2. Enlightened self-interest. Until we do that, we are all at grave risk of a more protracted pandemic.

Final comment. On rush to "new vaccines" current vaccines were designed vs original strain. As an image, they may sit in middle of an "immune map" -- that is, they cover the variants. Make new vaccine vs a variant at extreme of the map & you may reduce protection vs other existing variants.

Need to ensure the vaccines give good protection with the whole "immune map" - so far that has been with the vaccines vs original strain at the centre of the map. Lessons from flu immune landscapes & immune distance.

[2] India: endemic, commentary
Date: Sat 27 Nov 2021
From: T Jacob John <tjacobjohn@yahoo.co.in> [edited]


This is in response to: ProMED. COVID-19 update (386): India (endemic), sleep disorders, measles, WHO 20211111.8699607

As my report on India reaching and sustaining endemic prevalence for over 19 weeks was posted, the moderator wondered if it will be further sustained. As of today, 16 more days has passed with continuing the low daily numbers of cases, about 10 000 for the last 10 days. A 2nd country has reached endemic phase: Japan. After reaching the 5th wave peak of 26 164 cases on 22 Aug [2021], cases declined and passed below 2000 (which is less than 10% of peak number) on 1 Oct [2021], 8 weeks ago. On 8 Oct [2021], the daily case number fell below 1000; on 20 Oct [2021], below 500; and on 10 Nov [2021], below 200.

The next country to reach and sustain low and steady daily case numbers -- the endemic phase, in other words -- is Israel. After reaching 5th wave peak of 11 155 on 20 Aug [2021], daily case number fell below 1000 by 24 Oct [2021], sustained for nearly 5 weeks; since 10 Nov [2021], below 500 cases. Both Japan and Israel have vaccinated over 2/3 of population with 2 doses, and the slow build-up of immune population (vaccinations and daily infections) will ensure continued endemicity. These numbers are 7-day moving averages (sources: Worldometer and Our World in Data).

One cautionary note pertains to the nu variant, B.1.1.529 [omicron], and its degree of antigenic drift and its basic reproduction number. If both are significantly more than that of delta variant, it may alter the pattern of endemicity. But we have the ability to prevent its importation through air travel testing/quarantine tactics and ability to 'hyper-immunise' with booster doses to prevent or at least slow down its widespread spread.

[3] Mild symptoms following omicron infection
Date: Sat 27 Nov 2021
Source: The Telegraph [edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/south-african-doctor-raised-alarm-omicron-variant-says-symptoms/


The first South African doctor to alert the authorities about patients with the omicron variant has told The Telegraph that the symptoms of the new variant are unusual but mild.

Dr Angelique Coetzee said she was first alerted to the possibility of a new variant when patients in her busy private practice in the capital Pretoria started to come in earlier this month [November 2021] with COVID-19 symptoms that did not make immediate sense. They included young people of different backgrounds and ethnicities with intense fatigue and a 6-year-old child with a very high pulse rate, she said. None suffered from a loss of taste or smell.

"Their symptoms were so different and so mild from those I had treated before," said Dr Coetzee, a GP for 33 years who chairs the South African Medical Association alongside running her practice. On 18 Nov [2021], when 4 family members all tested positive for COVID-19 with complete exhaustion, she informed the country's vaccine advisory committee.

She said, in total, about 2 dozen of her patients have tested positive for COVID-19 with symptoms of the new variant. They were mostly healthy men who turned up "feeling so tired". About half of them were unvaccinated. "We had one very interesting case, a kid, about 6 years old, with a temperature and a very high pulse rate, and I wondered if I should admit her. But when I followed up 2 days later, she was so much better," Dr Coetzee says.

Dr Coetzee, who was briefing other African medical associations on Saturday [27 Nov 2021], made clear her patients were all healthy, and she was worried the new variant could still hit older people -- with co-morbidities such as diabetes or heart disease -- much harder. "What we have to worry about now is that when older, unvaccinated people are infected with the new variant, and if they are not vaccinated, we are going to see many people with a severe [form of the] disease," she said. South African demographics are very different from those in the UK. Only about 6% of the population are over the age of 65. This means that older individuals who are more vulnerable to the virus may take some time to present.

The B.1.1.529 variant, now called omicron, was first identified in Botswana on 11 Nov [2021]. It has now been detected in the UK as well as South Africa, Israel, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Belgium. It is the most mutated form of COVID-19 discovered thus far, with 32 mutations to the spike protein. Scientists are concerned that the mutations may allow it to evade existing vaccines and spread quickly.

Two cases of omicron have now been found in the UK, with 2 people in Essex and Nottinghamshire testing positive for the new variant. UK officials are busy scouring testing databases for any further sign of the omicron variant, not least because there were many South Africans in the Twickenham area of south west London for the England and South Africa [rugby] match last Saturday [20 Nov 2021].

South African scientists say omicron is behind an explosion of cases in the country's Gauteng province, which is home to the country's commercial capital Johannesburg and Pretoria. Cases have rocketed up from about 550 a day last week to almost 4000 a day currently.

The UK, US, the EU, and Israel have all suspended travel to and from South Africa and the 5 surrounding countries: Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. The UK government added Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zambia to the travel red list as of Sunday [28 Nov 2021].

The Western travel ban has provoked anger among South Africans, with many claiming that they are being punished for having outstanding research institutions and being transparent about their findings.

[South Africa has administered at least 25 238 789 doses of COVID vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that's enough to have vaccinated about 21.6% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/south-africa/). Increasing the proportion of the population vaccinated in South Africa is the most important step to prevent omicron and other variants from spreading. Vaccines must be distributed globally, not only to privileged countries. Otherwise, everyone everywhere will remain vulnerable. Wearing masks and social distancing will contribute to protection as well. - Mod.LK]

[4] Molnupiravir
Date: Fri 26 Nov 2021
Source: Al Jazeera [edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/26/merck-covid-pill-shows-lower-efficacy-in-updated-study


Drugmaker Merck's experimental COVID-19 pill is significantly less effective in slashing hospitalisations and deaths than previously reported, the company has said, following the release of a full analysis of trial results. The United States-based firm said on Friday [26 Nov 2021] the oral drug, molnupiravir, showed a 30% reduction in hospitalisations and deaths when compared with a placebo, based on data from more than 1400 patients. Last month [October 2021], the company said data from 775 patients had showed that reduction was "approximately" 50%.

In the updated data, one death was reported in the molnupiravir arm of the study, compared with 9 in the placebo group.

Merck filed for a US authorisation of molnupiravir on 11 Oct [2021] following the interim data.

The release of the full analysis came before the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a set of documents on Friday [26 Nov 2021] intended to brief a panel of outside experts who are due to meet on Tuesday [30 Nov 2021] to discuss whether to recommend authorising the pill. The agency's staff did not make their own recommendation as to whether the pill should be approved.

FDA staff asked the panel to discuss whether the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks and whether the population for whom the drug should be authorised should be limited. They also asked the committee to weigh in on concerns over whether the drug could encourage the virus to mutate, and how those concerns could be mitigated. Merck's shares dropped nearly 3% to USD 80 in premarket trading amid an overall fall in the stock market due to news of a new coronavirus variant.

Pills such as molnupiravir and Paxlovid, a rival drug being developed by Pfizer, have been touted as potential game-changers as they can be taken as early home treatments to help prevent hospitalisations and deaths. Data from Pfizer's pill, following analysis of a study involving 1200 participants, showed an 89% reduction in the risk of coronavirus-related hospitalisations or deaths compared with a placebo.

The 2 experimental drugs have different mechanisms of action. Merck's is designed to introduce errors into the genetic code of the virus. Pfizer's drug, part of a class known as protease inhibitors, is designed to block an enzyme the coronavirus needs to multiply.

Last week, the European Union's medicines watchdog advised its member states they can use Merck's COVID-19 antiviral pill in emergency situations triggered by rising infection rates, ahead of the treatment's formal approval across the bloc. The United Kingdom conditionally approved molnupiravir, branded as Lagevrio, earlier this month [November 2021].

[In the past 24 hours, 15 countries including Germany (49 311), the UK (39 567), France (37 218), Russia (33 946), the USA (27 287), Poland (26 188), Turkey (23 759), the Netherlands (22 031), Belgium (21 772), Czech Republic (20 417), India (17 092), Viet Nam (16 067), Ukraine (14 200), Italy (12 869), and Austria (11 671) all reported more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 6689 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 25 Nov 2021 to late 26 Nov 2021). A total of 52 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 52 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 10.9 % decrease in daily reported cases and 8.4 % increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide, about 500 000 infections were newly confirmed in the past 24 hours with over 261.37 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.21 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
