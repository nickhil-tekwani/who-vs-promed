A total of 115 cases of anthrax in humans have been reported in the northern regions of the country, after they allegedly came into contact with, or consumed meat of suspected anthrax-infected carcasses.

Only 3 people have however been admitted [to hospital] with regard to the suspected anthrax outbreak, while no deaths were reported.

A joint press statement issued by agriculture ministry executive director Percy Misika and his counterpart in the health ministry, Ben Nangombe, detailed the effects of the suspected anthrax disease breakout in the Kunene and Zambezi regions.

The statement details that 104 suspected cases of human anthrax were reported at the Otjitanga village in the Kunene region after the village community had consumed and had close contact with anthrax-contaminated meat.

In the Zambezi region, the Katima Mulilo district reported suspected cases after 11 people developed lesions on different parts of their bodies after consuming meat from a hippo that died of an unknown cause, according to the statement.

A total of 68 small stock and 39 hippos have been reported dead. "Livestock deaths suspected to be caused by anthrax were detected at Otjitanga village in the Kunene region since [25 Sep 2019]," the statement said. "While in the Zambezi region, deaths of hippos at the lake of Liambezi were detected on the [29 Aug 2019].

Anthrax is a serious infectious disease that affects both animals and humans, and the bacteria can be found naturally in soil.
