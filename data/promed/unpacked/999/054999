BLUETONGUE, CATTLE, IMPORTED - S. KOREA

Among 663 cattle imported from Australia last month, 8 were found to be
infected with bluetongue, an insect-borne viral disease harmless to humans
but which may be fatal to cows. This announcement fueled already strong
opposition to the imports, which was further stoked on Sunday when 2 of the
cattle died.
In a compromise, the government asked the farmers to allow the cows into
the farm in Kyongju, about 300 km (186 miles) southeast of Seoul, and
promised further quarantine tests within 10 days. "They will be sent to the
quarantine office at Inchon within the next 10 days for another round of
(bluetongue disease) tests," said Nam Ho-kyung, chairman of an association
branch at Kyongju.
Authorities have given the cattle a clean bill of health, but farmers fear
possible disease from importing cattle and the loss of a pure home-bred
cattle industry. They fear distributors now allowed to sell imported cattle
as domestic if the animals are raised for 6 months here will unlawfully
also cover up the foreign origin of the cattle.
"Considering distribution flows, it is highly likely imported cattle will
be sold, disguised as pure home-bred cattle," Nam said. "What if other
cattle are later found to have the (bluetongue) disease or other diseases?
Who's going to pay for the damage, the importer or the government?" Nam asked?
On Monday, Australian officials said the cattle must have caught bluetongue
in transit, or some were carrying antibodies without having the disease, as
they tested negative before departing Australia.
Korea had outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease last year but has not had
bluetongue or mad cow disease.

[Bluetongue is a noncontagious viral disease of sheep, wild ruminants, and
occasionally cattle, goats, and carnivores. Infection is much more common
than disease; bluetongue infection and disease have been reported on all
continents except Antarctica. There are 24 serotypes worldwide. The
distribution of the disease is limited by the culicoid insect vector, which
serves as the principal means of transmission between ruminant species.
The usual incubation is 5-10 days. Cattle seldom have apparent infections.
The disease in cattle is characterized by vesicular and ulcerative lesions
in the oral cavity, hyperesthesia, and a vesicular and ulcerative
dermatitis. Susceptible cattle and sheep infected during pregnancy may
abort or deliver malformed calves or lambs. Ataxia and blindness at birth
may be caused by hydranencephaly or porencephaly.
There are vaccines that may be used. However, use of serotypes other than
the one(s) causing infection affords little or no protection. - Mod.TG]
