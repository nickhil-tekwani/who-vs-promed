A cholera epidemic in Cameroon's economic capital, Douala, has killed
at least 44 people since Jan 2004, national radio announced. A total
of 2669 cases of cholera have been registered since the start of
January, 98 of them on 3 Jun 2004 alone, the radio said.
The epidemic appears to be spreading rapidly. Nearly 750 new cases
have been reported by government media since 17 May 2004, and 15
people have died. On 17 May 2004, government daily Cameroon Tribune
said 1922 cases had been registered since the start of the year and
state radio said 29 people had died.
"We are overwhelmed by this situation. We need more medical staff to
get rid of this plague," one of the 70 young doctors sent to Douala
to help the city's medical team told AFP by telephone.
Several cases of cholera have also been registered since Jan 2004 in
Limbe, in the English-speaking southwest of the majority
French-speaking country.

Cholera Epidemic Coming to an End
------------------------------------
The Mozambican health authorities say that the cholera epidemic that
has been raging in parts of the country since December 2004 has come
under control, thanks both to the onset of winter and the improvement
of sanitation conditions in some urban centers.
Maputo city health director Olivia Ferreira, cited in the Mon 7 Jun
2004 issue of the daily paper "Noticias", said that the Cholera
Treatment Center (CTC) at the Mavalane General Hospital is currently
receiving only 2 or 3 patients a day, compared with more than 300 a
day at the peak of the epidemic. Only 5 patients were still under
medical care at the center by late Sun 6 Jun 2004. During the first
3 to 4 months of this year, the Mavalane CTC were always treating
more than 100 patients at a time.
Since the outbreak of the disease in Maputo, during the 1st week of
December 2003, the Mavalane CTC has treated about 12 000 patients,
with 40 deaths, all from Maputo city.
In the central province of Sofala, the 2nd most affected by the
disease, with more than 5000 cases and 32 deaths since January 2004,
the situation is also reported as calm.

In southern Sindh province contaminated water has caused the deaths of
38 people, mostly children, a minister said.
Tainted water in Hyderabad city, home to 3.6 million people, 160
kilometers (100 miles) northeast of Karachi, has claimed 38 lives
over the past month, while more than 4000 people reported
gastroenteritis problems.
"At least 32 children and 6 adults have so far died of water-related
diseases," chief of Hyderabad's Civil Hospital Hadi Bux Jatoi said.
The problem began when provincial irrigation authorities released
water from overflowing Manchar Lake, 130 kilometers (81 miles)
northwest of Hyderabad, into thr Indus River, the key source of the
city's water supply.
Officials said scores of people suffering from diarrhea, cholera and
other water-borne diseases had been rushing to the 2 public and
private hospitals daily ever since the problem erupted.
Water quality seems to have improved with emergency measures and
gradual replacement of water reservoirs with new ones. "Now the water
quality is better and the incidence of water-related diseases is receding,"
Ishtiaq said.
