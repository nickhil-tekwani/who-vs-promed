Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), which is caused by enterovirus 71 (EV-71) [as well as a number of other related viruses - Mod.LL] has reappeared in Cambodia, a local Kampuchea Thmey Daily newspaper reported Wednesday, 23 Apr 2014. Dr. Ly Sovann, chief of the Health Ministry's Communicable Disease Control Department, told the paper that the disease claimed the life of a boy and sickened 7 other children recently.

The disease broke out in the country from April to August in 2012. The severe form of the disease killed at least 57 Cambodian children during that period, according to a joint statement by the Health Ministry and the WHO. It had disappeared in 2013 and just reoccurred in 2014, Ly Sovann told the paper, adding that the ministry has been closely monitoring the situation.

HFMD virus is contagious and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons, according to WHO. Good hygiene practice can prevent HFMD as, currently, there is no specific treatment available for the disease.

[It is not clear where in the country the outbreak has occurred.

The following is an outbreak disease report from WHO (Mon 9 Jul 2012, http://www.who.int/csr/don/2012_07_09/en/index.html) regarding an earlier, impressive outbreak of an enterovirus 71 associated outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease, a usually quite benign illness in young children:

"As part of the continuing investigations into the undiagnosed illness, the Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Cambodia is finalizing the review of all suspected hospitalised cases. This final review added an additional 2 cases between April to 5 Jul 2012, making the total number of children affected to be 59. Of these, 52 have died. The age of the cases range from 3 months to 11 years old, with the majority being under 3 years old. The overall male:female ratio is 1.3:1. Laboratory samples were not available for the majority of the cases as they died before appropriate samples could be taken.

Based on the latest laboratory results, a significant proportion of the samples tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV-71), which causes hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). The EV-71 virus has been known to generally cause severe complications amongst some patients. Additionally, a number of other pathogens, including dengue and _Streptococcus suis_, were identified in some of the samples. The samples were found to be negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses, SARS and Nipah viruses.

Further investigations into matching the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological information are ongoing and are likely to be concluded in a few days. WHO and partners, which include Institut Pasteur and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are assisting the Ministry of Health with this event. The government is also reinforcing awareness of good hygiene practices to the public, which include frequent washing of hands.

Some facts on hand, foot and mouth disease: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. The symptoms commonly observed include fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild, self-limiting disease with a few complications. HFMD is also caused by enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications in certain groups and may cause deaths.

HFMD mainly occurs amongst children under 10 years old. The usual period from infection to onset of symptoms is 3-7 days. The disease usually begins with fever, poor appetite, malaise, and frequently with a sore throat. One or 2 days after fever onset, painful sores develop in the mouth. They begin as small red spots that blister and then often become ulcers. They are usually located on the tongue, gums and inside of the cheeks. A non-itchy skin rash develops over 1-2 days with flat or raised red spots, some with blisters. The rash is usually located on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and may also appear on the buttocks and/or genitalia. A person with HFMD may not have symptoms or may have only the rash or only mouth ulcers. In a small number of cases, children may experience a brief febrile illness, present with mixed neurological and respiratory symptoms and succumb rapidly from the disease.

HFMD virus is contagious, and infection is spread from person to person by direct contact with nose or throat discharges, saliva, fluid from blisters, or the stool of infected persons. Infected persons are most contagious during the 1st week of the illness, but the period of communicability can last for several weeks. HFMD is not transmitted from pets or other animals. HFMD should not be confused with the different disease in animals called foot-and-mouth disease.

Presently, there is no specific treatment available for HFMD. Patients should drink plenty of water or other liquids and may require treatment of the symptoms. Health care providers are advised to treat patients according to their symptoms and to refrain from using steroids." - Mod.LL
