[1] Viet Nam (Da Nang)
Date: Mon 27 Jul 2020 13:58 EDT
Source: BBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53549809


Viet Nam has closed Da Nang to tourists after 15 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases were recorded there -- the 1st in the country since April [2020]. Tourists cannot enter the city for 14 days and up to 80 000, mostly domestic, visitors are to be flown home.

Viet Nam has been lauded as a success story of the pandemic having acted early to close borders and enforce quarantine and contact tracing. It has recorded just over 400 cases and no deaths. But over the past 4 days, nearly 100 days after its last locally transmitted case, 14 new cases emerged in Da Nang, a central coastal city popular with domestic tourists. Another case was reported in nearby Quang Ngai Province.

Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Monday [27 Jul 2020] ordered Da Nang residents to re-implement social distancing and close all non-essential services. He said the response had to be "decisive" but that he was not yet ordering a total lockdown of the city. Analysis by scientists found that the strain of the virus in Da Nang had not previously been detected in the country, Viet Nam's health minister said. Nguyen Thanh Long said that claims the strain was more contagious than others seen in the country were yet to be confirmed.

Links between cases unclear
---------------------------
The 1st new case -- patient 416 -- was a 57-year-old man who sought medical care on [20 Jul 2020] for flu symptoms. He is now on a ventilator and, according to doctors quoted in local media, in a critical condition. Contact tracing identified more than 100 people who had interacted with the man, but all returned negative tests.

However over the weekend [25-26 Jul 2020], 3 more cases were confirmed, including one 17 year old from neighbouring Quang Ngai province who had travelled home on a coach with people who had been at the Da Nang C Hospital. Da Nang C Hospital sealed its doors in response to the 1st diagnosis.

On Monday [27 Jul 2020], a further 11 cases were confirmed. 7 were patients at a hospital in Da Nang and 4 are medical staff. The hospital was not identified. The cases have raised fears that a full outbreak could be under way in Da Nang.

With international travel largely impossible, Da Nang had been promoted as a holiday destination for Vietnamese people. Officials say up to 80 000 domestic tourists are in the city, so extra flights are being laid on to take them home. People may be asked to quarantine on their return, according to media reports. Hospitals across the country have also stepped up preventative measures, while the capital, Hanoi, has begun urging people to wear masks in public again. Domestic football matches were also suspended on Sunday [26 Jul 2020].

The new cases are a significant setback for Viet Nam, which has been proud of its success in containing the virus. It has been praised by the World Health Organization (WHO). Unlike many countries, Viet Nam acted early on the pandemic, before it even had confirmed cases. It recognised that it did not have the resources to tackle widespread infection so instead, did everything it could to keep the virus out altogether. It closed its borders to almost all travellers except returning citizens and requires anyone entering the country to quarantine in government facilities for 14 days and undergo testing. Most of its cases have been detected in quarantine. An extensive contact tracing and testing operation also meant it was able to quickly quash local outbreaks.

[Viet Nam had deserved all of the praise in handling the initial introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 early on. One suspects this virus has won again by a stealth entry -- possibly a returning Vietnamese who tested negative (false negative) during mandated quarantine, possibly beginning to shed virus at the end of the quarantine, and was asymptomatic. And may have returned to Da Nang, or perhaps had contacts who were infected and went to Da Nang on holiday. Hopefully with rapid implementation of control measures (including lockdown) this cycle will be interrupted. This virus is tenacious and smart, and nasty -- by the time it reaches a high risk individual, it has had stealth transmission ongoing under the radarscope. It's a similar story in many countries, with the true index case not being identified.

Da Nang is a beautiful resort city in the southern part of the central region, on the South China Sea.

[2] Clinical manifestations - D614G mutation role?
Date: Mon 27 Jul 2020
From: Philip Tierno <germdoctor@gmail.com> [edited]


Unusual manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-2) infection
--------------------------------------------------------
As I have been following the science and medical reports over these past few months of sequestration, I have been observing one report after another of unusual manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infections including in areas of the body far removed from the respiratory tract. Certainly, it is known that the virus causes respiratory and intestinal infections especially in individuals with co-morbidities like high blood pressure, diabetes, smokers (including vapor smokers), obesity, COPD, the elderly, and immunosuppressed.

We do know that the protein spike (S) on the surface of the virus attaches to ACE-2 receptors on human cells and likewise for animals. Previous studies have shown that ACE-2 proteins on alveolar epithelial cells in the lungs and on the enterocytes of small intestine serve as attachment sites for COVID-19 virus causing respiratory and intestinal infections. Yet we find many other manifestations of disease, some of which are strange, in this current pandemic caused by COVID-19 virus, such as clotting disease, infarcts, cardiovascular problems, inflammatory syndromes, nausea, and vomiting, persistent sporadic fever, chilblain, Kawasaki syndrome (toxic shock-like), headaches, brain fog, muscular fatigue, live, and kidney anomalies, etc. I think that these symptoms are not as unusual if one realizes that besides alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine there are numerous other tissues that have the capacity for expressing the ACE-2 protein such as vascular endothelial tissue, renal tubular epithelia, Leydig cells in testes, lymph nodes, thymus, spleen, liver, skin, gastrointestinal tract, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, brain stem and others. The prevalence of ACE-2 sites in such a wide variety of cell types may allow us to gain better insight and understanding into the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 virus infections.

Apparently the COVID-19 virus has a plethora of body sites to infect thereby causing additional pathology to primary respiratory pathology likely via a hematogenous route when the virus becomes systemic. The D614G mutation has also possibly enabled the spike protein to infect more cells and cell types than the non-mutated strains.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Tierno for sharing his insights with us. The observation of multiple different organ involvement associated with infection with the SARS-CoV-2 infection is continually adding to the list of manifestations of the clinical presentation. Coincidentally, there was a lay press article in Forbes on 26 Jul 2020, mentioning hearing loss as the sole clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (see https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/07/26/can-covid-19-coronavirus-cause-hearing-problems-even-with-no-other-symptoms/#7e1afaaa1902. While the article has a whimsical presentation, the information provided is supportive of the observation).

Dr Tierno's provocative speculation re: the role of the D614G mutation in the affinity for more cell type infections sent us to the literature in search of studies addressing this observation. We found the articles suggesting the role in increasing the transmissibility of the virus (refs 1 and 2). In ref 3, the authors demonstrated susceptibility to infection with resultant high cellular transduction in lung, liver, and colon cells.

Again, Thank you Dr Tierno for sending your comments and raising the possibility of this mutation increasing the varied cell lines susceptible to viral transduction.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences. Spain has been added again as it is dealing with a 2nd wave after lifting of restrictions, primarily focused in Catalonia and Aragon. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- This Thursday [30 Jul 2020] it will be 6 months since WHO declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. At today's [27 Jul 2020] press briefing WHO Director-General Dr Tedros reiterated the basic measures that are needed to suppress transmission and save lives -- to find, isolate, test, and care for cases; and trace and quarantine their contacts. "Where these measures are followed, cases go down. Where they're not, cases go up."

- The 'Subject in Focus' today highlights the Second Global Research and Innovation Forum which was hosted virtually by WHO on [1 and 2 Jul 2020]. This followed on from the 1st forum held in February 2020. Approximately 1200 participants from nearly 100 countries convened to review the science, to establish what we know now that we didn't know at the start of the pandemic, and to set priorities for the COVID-19 research agenda.

[Caution should be in place in drawing conclusions about relative standings as there is definitely weekend/post-weekend artifact with key countries not submitting reports to WHO on numbers of cases in the past 24 hours: In Europe, Spain, France, Sweden, and Belarus did not report any new cases. In the Americas, the USA reported over 60 000 new cases. In Africa, Algeria reported over 1000 cases...

The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 59.0% of the global newly reported cases and 67.7% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 8.3 million cases. The USA reported 42.6% of cases (63 968), Brazil 34.1% (51 147), Colombia 4.8% (7254), Mexico 4.5% (6751), Argentina 3.2% (4801), Peru 2.6% (3923), and Chile 1.5% (2198).

- The European region reported 6.8% of the global newly reported cases and 4.7% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 32.4% (5635 of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 8.1% (1402), (Spain 0% (0)), Israel 6.9% (1199), Romania 6.4% (1120), Turkey 5.3% (927), Ukraine 4.6% (807), (France 0% (0)), the UK 4.3% (745), Uzbekistan 3.4% (594), Kyrgyzstan 2.8% (483), and Serbia 2.7% (467). Italy, while not reporting more than 300 new cases to WHO, has increased its 7-day average by 19.2% over the preceding 7-day period, a sign there are increases in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (calculated from the daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=5351&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.9% of the global newly reported cases and 8.2% of global newly reported fatalities. Iraq reported 19.9% (2459), of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 18.9% (2333), Saudi Arabia 16.0% (1968), Pakistan 9.5% (1176), Oman 9.3% (1147), Morocco 5.1% (633), Egypt 3.9% (479), and Kuwait 3.8% (464). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020, while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq and Oman. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 6.6% of the global newly reported cases and 3.5% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 67.2% (11 233) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria 7.2% (1198), Ethiopia 2.6% (720), Ghana 3.5% (586), Nigeria 3.3% (555), Madagascar 2.6% (429), and Cameroon 2.4% (402). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 18 of the 27 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.5% of the global newly reported cases and 0.86% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 53.2% (2036) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 15.8% (607), Singapore 12.6% (481), Australia 11.8% (453), China 4.9% (189), and South Korea 0.65% (25).

- The South East Asia region reported 21.2% of the global newly reported cases and 15.1% of global deaths. India reported 92.6% (49 931) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.2% (2275) and Indonesia 2.8% (1492). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (26 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.4% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported 61 571 cases, followed by India (46 484), and Brazil (23 579). These 3 countries account for half of all confirmed cases globally (50.2%). There were 4449 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, South Africa, Spain, Russia, Mexico, and Argentina, all known global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4890 to 61 571. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Bangladesh, Iraq, France, Iran, Chile, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, Philippines, and Indonesia; their range of reported new cases is 1525 to 2772.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 10.7%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 14.8%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. That being said, the most severely affected region is still the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
