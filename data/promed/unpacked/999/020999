>Updated 2019.09.12 07:22 The Korea Centers for
>Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said that
>it has confirmed that contaminated fermented
>shellfish was the main culprit behind the
>hepatitis A outbreak this summer. The KCDC came
>to the conclusions after conducting an in-depth
>epidemiological investigation. The agency
>randomly sampled 270 of the 2,178 hepatitis A
>patients, diagnosed between July 28 and August
>24, and surveyed whether they consumed fermented
>shellfish this summer. It found that 42 percent
>of the patients had eaten fermented shellfish
>during the incubation period. KCDC also found
>that 80.7 percent of the 26 patients diagnosed
>with hepatitis A in August also ate fermented
>shellfish, while discovering Hepatitis A virus
>genes in 11 batches out of the 18 batches
>collected after the outbreak. Notably, five of
>these genes found in the research showed close
>relations with the virus detected in hepatitis A
>patients. The agency recommended that the public
>should stop consuming salted clams until it can
>confirm that they are safe to eat. The Ministry
>of Food and Drug Safety also plans to conduct a
>full survey of fermented shellfish distribution
>products this month. As of now, the disease
>control agency has confirmed 10 products that
>have tested positive to the hepatitis A virus.
>Nine of them were imported from China, and one
>was made in Korea. ÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬Ã..."Out of the total 10
>products, weighing 37,094kg, 31,764kg has
>already been sold to the markets, while the
>remaining 5,330 kg were recovered and disposed
>of,ÃÂ¢Ã¢ÂÂ¬ the agency said. The KFDC asked the
>producers of sauced clams to halt the
>distribution and sale of their products for the
>time being and to conduct the hepatitis A virus
>test for each product when importing fermented
>shellfish. corea022@docdocdoc.co.kr ÃÂ Best
