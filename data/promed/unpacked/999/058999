The numbers are up again for people infected with a bacterial illness after
visiting central Florida petting zoos. 5 new cases have been confirmed in
children, bringing the total number to 22. The latest results include 3 in
Volusia County and 1 each in Charlotte and Collier counties. 24 other
infections are suspected.
Some victims have tested positive for the _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacterium, and
others have developed a related kidney disease, potentially
life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. In one bit of good news, a
suspected link between the outbreak and the death of a 12-year-old Pasco
County girl has been ruled out. Tests came back negative for the _E. coli_
strain at the center of the probe.
Investigators are leaning more toward petting zoo animals than food vendors
as the source of the problem, Lindsay Hodges, a spokeswoman for the state
Health Department, said Wednesday. All of the victims visited the Central
Florida Fair in Orange County or the Florida Strawberry Festival in Plant
City earlier in Mar 2005.
A petting zoo planned this weekend at the Springtime Tallahassee festival
has been canceled. The Lake County Fair, starting Apr 7 2005 in Eustis, has
ruled out a petting zoo from the same company used by the 2 central Florida
events.

Is there any news about PFGE typing/identification of this O157?
The 1st posting mentioned a quote from one of the petting zoo operators who
offered to have his animals tested. PFGE would help narrow down/identify
the source and determine if this is a single outbreak or multiple
mini-outbreaks.

[The number of affected individuals (primarily children) continues to grow.
Since the incubation period from exposure to the petting zoos is over,
newly reported cases are either just being recognized after presenting
earlier or are secondarily spread infections. As suspected, the
12-year-old who died is no longer considered to be part of the cluster.
No data are yet available on any more specific typing of the O157 strain(s)
isolated. - Mod.LL]
