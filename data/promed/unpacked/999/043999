The outbreak of Japanese encephalitis [JE has pushed the demand for wild
boar meat in Pahang [a state on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia -
Mod. CYC. Checks of the markets [in Kuantan revealed that wild boar meat
were being sold out as soon as they were put up for sale.
One pork seller said a kilogram of the meat was being sold between RM6 and
RM7, compared with RM3 and RM4 last year. He added that the demand for the
meat had been overwhelming, as it was the alternative to [domestic pigs.
"Although we have told buyers that it is safe to eat pork, they are
skeptical," he said.
[Are wild boars carriers of any known infectious agents? - Mod. CYC
[Wild boars are hosts of various parasites and may harbor ticks infected
with viruses but that could be the least of the problems associated with
increased "harvest" of wild animals. - Mod.CHC

The Health Ministry has advised all persons handling pigs or pork to wear
masks, gloves and protective overalls as the new strain of virus
[Hendra-like virus is transmitted through direct contact. Deputy
Director-General of Health (public health) Datuk Dr Abdul Aziz Mahmood said
the virus could be spread through bodily fluids, blood and secretions of
the animal. He said the rule should be observed by those involved in
transporting pigs or pork, abattoir workers and even those selling pork.
"Those coming in contact with pigs or pork should take the necessary
precautions and play it safe ....this is serious advice," he told a press
conference at the Japanese encephalitis operations centre at the Health
Ministry [Sunday afternoon.
Also present were University of Malaya's Head of [Medical Microbiology
Professor Lam Sai Kit and Director of Epidemiology and Veterinary Medicine
at the Veterinary Services Department, Dr Abdul Aziz Mangkat. Although
there have been no new JE cases, Dr Aziz said 48 patients were recuperating
in hospitals. A total of 136 people have been infected by the virus and 64
deaths reported. [There were laboratory confirmed JE cases among the 136
people as stated by the Health Ministry; thus not all cases were due to
Hendra-like virus, as implied here. - Mod.CYC.
"Because it (the new strain) is unknown, we have to treat it with great
respect," Lam said. He said the experts [from Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention would also bring with them kits to test the virus. He said
a biohazardous microbiology laboratory had been upgraded for the tests to
be carried out. Lam said the laboratory would comply with international
safety standards and would have a safety rating standard of P3.
[Any such protective clothing should either be disposable or sterilizable.
By "implied here", Dr. Chan means "in this report", not "in ProMED-mail".
Does anyone know whether there have been laboratory infections with this
Hendra-like virus? - Mod.CHC

Experts at University Hospital [on Friday began treating victims of the
new Hendra-like virus with a drug which is now being used to treat another
virus that attacks the respiratory system. The experts are not sure
whether the US drug, called ribavarin, will be effective in treating this
new virus but it has been used to effectively treat the respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV). "At present, we do not know enough about the
Hendra-like virus, therefore we do not know if it will work. We have to
try. The new virus we found and the RSV are in the same [virus family. The
drug inhibits the growth of RSV and we hope it will do the same for the
Hendra-like virus," University of Malaya's Head of Medical Microbiology
Department Professor Lam Sai Kit said. The only problem is that the drug
has a side effect as it can cause anaemia. "But we thought at this stage
where the illness is causing more suffering that we have to try it. The
benefits far outweigh the side effects," said Lam.
