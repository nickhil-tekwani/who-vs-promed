Report of detection of exotic mosquito importation Darwin, NT, Australia, 2
Mar 2000.
Peter Whelan, Senior Medical Entomologist, Territory Health Services.
Importation, inspection and action details
An Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) officer, advised the
Medical Entomology Branch (MEB) of Territory Health Services (THS) at 2pm 2
March 2000, of the detection of mosquito larvae in cargo ex Dili, East
Timor which appeared to be _Aedes aegypti_. A sample of collected larvae
were examined by an MEB entomologist at the AQIS office at 2.30 PM and he
confirmed that they were _Ae. aegypti_. There were 5 freshly killed late
fourth instar larvae. The Northern Territory is currently free of _Ae.
aegypti_ but the species is present in Queensland and countries to the
north of Australia.
The large steel shipping container (reference number CRXY126) was from the
vessel Arktis Atlantic, that was loaded in Dili on 24 Feb 2000 and arrived
at the Perkins Wharf area at Frances Bay in Darwin on 26 Feb 2000. The
container was a returning 'empty' container but was loaded with
opportunistic items, which included luggage, rubbish and empty gas bottles.
The quarantine officer who first opened the shipping container on the 2 Mar
2000 had observed a live mosquito fly out. A mosquito was also observed to
bite a quarantine officer standing next to him. He immediately closed the
container doors. He thought the mosquito that was observed flying went back
inside the container. AQIS organised the immediate spraying of the inside
of the container and some pooling water in a plastic sheeting with a can of
aircraft disinsection aerosol on hand containing permethrin, and the
container was resealed.
The MEB and AQIS officers opened the container at 3pm while at the same
time spraying the aerosol d-Phenothrin 20:80 aircraft spray into the
opening door. They then sprayed the entire inside of the container with 2
complete cans of spray and closed the container for 15 minutes before
further inspection. No flying mosquitoes were observed and no dead
mosquitoes could be seen on the floor or luggage.
Mosquito larvae were found in two pools of approximately one litre of water
each in the folds of a large sheet of transparent plastic protective
sheeting jumbled into a large open slatted wooden box. There were two other
smaller volumes of water in the sheeting without larvae. Numerous live
larvae and dark coloured pupae were observed in the water. Pupal skins were
observed in the water. Samples of larvae were taken and the water surface
was sprayed with the d-Phenothrin. Further samples were then taken and
placed in to a separate sample jar after the spraying. A thorough
inspection of the container revealed two damaged truck tyres on rims, but
they were completely dry inside.
The container was then sealed again while arrangements were made to conduct
a fogging operation in the general area that night, and to obtain cans of
aerosol permethrin. The permethrin aerosol was applied to the water in the
container at approximately 3.30 PM and the container resealed overnight and
arrangements made for the incineration of the plastic the following day,
following similar spraying procedures when opening the container.
The MEB made arrangements to fog the Frances Bay Wharf area that evening. A
media radio statement was released to advise the public and businesses in
the area of the fogging. THS prepared an information flier and distributed
it to the businesses in the area in the afternoon. Arrangements were made
with the international freight manager of Perkins, to ensure access to all
parts of the premises in the evening, and for the caretaker to be on hand
to open all large sheds for fogging.
The fogging operation was conducted by MEB between 6.10 and 7.10 PM. 2 Mar
2000. A Leco ulv [ultra-low volume heavy-duty trailer mounted fogger was
used to dispense Bioresmethrin ulv formulation insecticide diluted 1:1.5
with diesel. The entire Perkins facility was fogged, as well as all
business premises within 400metres of Perkins, from the Frances Bay Mooring
basin to the former Powerhouse, including Darwin Ship Repairs and
Fisherman's Wharf premises.
This importation had a reasonable possibility for the introduction of
_Aedes aegypti_ into the port area of Darwin. The steel shipping container
was not air proof and two breather holes were not mosquito proof. The fact
that the container had hatched pupal skins and live adult female
mosquitoes, and had been in port for 5 days, indicates a possibility that
live females could have escaped. The fogging operation reduced the chance
of live adults in the area, but there was still the possibility that female
mosquitoes could be alive or that some could have escaped previously. Any
previous escapes could have already laid eggs in the numerous water-filled
tyres in the area.
Subsequent vector control and monitoring
1. All tyres and other receptacles containing water in Perkins were placed
under quarantine restriction.
2. All receptacles in the Frances Bay area within 400 metres of the Perkins
premises were sprayed with water emulsifiable deltamethrin (Cislin) at
label recommendations. The water surfaces, and above the water surface to
overflow levels, were sprayed to the point of spray run off. Each
receptacle was marked with an identifiable spray mark as it is sprayed. A
check was made after spraying to verify that all receptacles have been
sprayed before lifting the quarantine restrictions.
3. A complete larval survey was made of all receptacles in the Frances Bay
area. All larvae present in any receptacle were collected and identified.
No exotic larvae were found.
4. There was an expansion of the existing ovitrap program in the Perkins
vicinity. This expanded surveillance will remain for two months until the
all clear is given.
5. No exotic mosquitoes have been detected by AQIS or THS to date (20 Mar
2000). It appears that the eradication has been a success, but surveillance
is continuing.

[Hats off to the keen-eyed quarantine inspectors in Darwin! ProMED-mail
has an unconfirmed report that cases if dengue are being seen in the Darwin
area in people coming in from East Timor. If the dengue vector _Aedes
aegypti_ were to become established there, a dengue epidemic could easily
follow. - Mod.JW
