Brad Osadszuk, owner of the cow initially confirmed with bovine tuberculosis, and others were invited by the committee to brief members on the situation in south eastern Alberta, where 36 ranches are now in quarantine to contain spread of the illness.

Five more cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis have been found in south eastern Alberta since the 1st one was identified, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] confirmed on 18 Nov 2016. The 5 are from the same group as the 1st cow found with the disease, which was discovered in September 2016 after it had been shipped to the United States for slaughter.

Dr Penny Greenwood, national manager for domestic disease control with the CFIA, said the new positive cases show there has been transmission of TB from animal to animal. "These positive test results indicate transmission between animals has occurred. The CFIA is currently conducting a risk assessment to determine how these results impact the investigation and whether or not additional herds may be declared infected," she said.

Rich Smith, executive director of the Alberta Beef Producers, said discovery of additional cases was not necessarily a surprise, given that it is an infectious disease. "The fact that there has been transmission of it isn't good news," he said. "First, we were hoping that there wasn't any transmission. Now we're hoping that it is minimal. It would be really good if these were the last animals that were found with TB." Greenwood said the new cases have no effect on food safety, nor do they represent any impact on cattle or beef trade.

The 36 ranches quarantined, 34 in Alberta and 2 in Saskatchewan, comprise an estimated 18 000 animals. The infected cows are on 3 different premises because they were commingled in pastures in the Jenner, Brooks and Suffield regions of Alberta. The Saskatchewan ranches had cattle adjacent to those in Alberta and were thus included in the quarantine. No Saskatchewan cattle have tested positive.

Greenwood confirmed that the strain of TB in the 1st cow is related to a strain seen in Mexico, and it has not been seen before in Alberta. Results of genetic tests on TB strains that affected the other 5 infected animals have yet to be analyzed. The source of the infection thus remains unknown. More than 50 CFIA staff are now involved in the response and testing of the quarantined herds, with priority given to the source herd and trace outs, Greenwood said. She added that the testing is expected to take months.

The Canadian Cattlemen's Association, ABP, and other groups are working to set up a feedlot where calves from the quarantined cow herds could be fed over winter. Many of the ranchers involved in the quarantine habitually wean and sell the calf crop each fall and do not have the facilities, feed or in some cases, water, to overwinter double their usual number of animals. Greenwood said the province and Agriculture Canada are also looking at options to help producers with access to water and feed for their livestock to get them through the quarantine period.

Some ranchers have questioned whether the large wild elk herd that frequents Canadian Forces Base Suffield, which is in the same area, may have spread the TB. Greenwood said bovine tuberculosis favours cattle, so elk are "an abnormal host" for the disease. That said, she added a dense elk population could be a low-level reservoir for TB, as has happened at Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.

Given that the TB strain so far identified is from Mexico, Greenwood said the CFIA will be considering the ways it entered Canada, be it wildlife, imported cattle, or humans.

Drew Barnes, the Wildrose MLA for Cypress-Medicine Hat, said on 21 Nov 2016 that he had found "tremendous empathy" among his constituents for the plight of ranchers with herds in quarantine. "They know what a hardship this can be, and they're certainly hoping and cheering for things to go well." He said he is also hearing concern about the wild elk herd in the region and speculation about any connection between elk and spread of bovine TB.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] has approved a plan that would allow ranchers affected by the bovine tuberculosis outbreak in south east Alberta to move their cattle off their properties. The food safety watchdog said on Friday [25 Nov 2016] that it has given the go-ahead to a beef industry proposal to establish a feedlot as an alternate quarantine site, a move that would give some relief to the ranchers who have said their properties are not set up to feed and water quarantined cattle over the winter months.

A total of 35 ranches (31 in south east Alberta and 4 in south west Saskatchewan) are currently prevented from moving their animals while the CFIA conducts an investigation into an outbreak of bovine TB. Six confirmed cases have been found so far and linked to a single herd near Jenner, Alberta.

Dr Jaspinder Komal, the CFIA's deputy chief veterinary officer, said it will be up to the beef industry to find an available feedlot. He said if all goes as planned, cattle could begin to be moved to the approved location as early as Monday or Tuesday [28-29 Nov 2016] next week. "This feedlot option ensures that the quarantine is maintained and that appropriate biosecurity measures are in place to control the risk of disease exposure for other animals," Komal said.

The move was applauded by beef industry representatives, who have been lobbying for an alternate quarantine site to lift the pressure off ranchers who had expected to sell their calves earlier this fall [2016] and aren't prepared to winter them. Approximately 22 000 cattle are currently affected by the CFIA quarantine. "It'll make a big difference to these guys to get the calves out of the way," said Alberta Beef Producers chair Bob Lowe. "There's going to be people starting calving while this quarantine is still going on. So to be able to get this current calf crop out of the way is just going to make a big difference to their emotional state." It's not clear yet who will pay to feed and house the quarantined cattle at the approved feedlot. Lowe said he is hopeful a disaster relief funding package, expected to be announced as early as next week, will go a long way toward helping ranchers cover the expense.

Though details have yet to be announced, federal agriculture minister Lawrence MacAulay said in the House of Commons on Thursday [24 Nov 2016] that the government is considering all options to help ranchers under quarantine as a result of the discovery of 6 cases of bovine TB near Jenner, Alberta. He said discussions are taking place with the governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan to expedite an aid package. "The minister committed to working with his provincial counterparts as quickly as possible to cover extra costs faced by producers experiencing income declines due to bovine TB," said Guy Gallant, spokesperson for the minister, in an email on Friday [25 Nov 2016]. "This would help provide financial assistance for extraordinary costs such as interest costs on loans due to the circumstances."

Though the CFIA compensates producers whose animals have to be destroyed as a result of an investigation, it doesn't provide compensation for losses incurred as a result of being unable to get healthy animals to the feedlot or auction block because of a quarantine. Nor does it compensate producers for being forced to hold onto and feed their calves over the winter months while the investigation continues.

The province of Alberta has made a formal request to the federal government, under the terms of the AgriRecovery Framework, for assistance for producers affected by the bovine TB quarantine. AgriRecovery is a federal-provincial program designed to help producers recover extraordinary costs in the event of a disaster, beyond what is available through other financial assistance programs.

In an interview, provincial Agriculture Minister Oneil Carlier said he was encouraged to hear his federal counterpart suggest an announcement is forthcoming. "To be able to have this in place relatively soon is great news. ... I'm hoping perhaps as early as next week we'll have those details finalized and be able to move forward," Carlier said.

Bovine TB is a reportable disease in Canada and has been subject to a mandatory national eradication program since 1923. While Canada is considered to be officially free of bovine TB, isolated cases still occasionally occur. The latest bovine TB cases are not expected to affect border access for Canadian beef. Incidences of bovine TB generally pose very little risk to public health.

[These articles were published one day apart, but they differ in their reporting numbers. It is likely that there are 6 confirmed cases, as it is possible that a positive report was received late on 24 Nov 2016, to be reported on 25 Nov 2016.

It is good news that feed lots are being allowed and fellow ranchers and the government are likely to assist them. Keeping calves through the winter requires quite a lot of extra feed that is probably not budgeted for by anyone.

We wish the producers good luck as well as those involved in the tracing of this disease. - Mod.TG
