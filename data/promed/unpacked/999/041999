Farmers fear spread of unknown disease from deer
------------------------------------------------
The Junta (Provincial government) confirmed 42 deer cadavers in
Zamora, while the number of deer cadavers claimed by COAG
(Coordinadora de Organizaciones de Agricultores y Ganaderos,
Coordinated Farmers and Ranchers Organizations) is about 100.

The deer have died in the protected area of the Sierra del Culebra
(Zamora). So far, the authorities have failed to identify the cause
of these mortalities.

The 1st 2 dead deer were found on 28 Jul 2010 in the municipality of
Villadeciervos. Since poisoning was ruled out, an infectious disease
was suspected; autopsies results are not yet disclosed.

According to COAG, mouth lesion are suggestive of a hemorrhagic
disease. They fear a spread of the disease to cattle and other
domestic ruminants, criticizing the secrecy of the regional
government concerning the cause of disease.

[Orbiviruses, such as bluetongue and epizootic haemorrhagic disease
(EHD) viruses, are the main suspects of the described event. EHD is
known to be particularly pathogenic in deer.

The season of BTV-vectors activity has restarted in Spain and
Portugal, similarly to other European countries, in June. So far, no
BTV circulation has been reported during 2010. However, 2 virus
serotypes, BTV-4 and BTV-1, are known to be circulating in the
Maghreb countries. EHD was recorded there in 2006.

Details of the changes observed in the dead deer in Zamora, and
results of the their laboratory investigations are requested. In case
an orbivirus involvement is confirmed, the situation in Portugal,
bordering Zamora on its south, deserves to be investigated as well. - Mod.AS]
