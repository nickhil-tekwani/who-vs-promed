New cases of BTV-8 infections in Germany
----------------------------------------
The National Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue disease at the
Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) in Germany confirmed several new
outbreaks of BTV in Germany. A total of 2 sheep and one cattle, all
with clinical symptoms of bluetongue disease, had initially been
tested positive for BTV in both cELISA and PCR in regional
laboratories. Subsequently, the suspected cases were confirmed by the
reference laboratory at the FLI, Isle of Riems.
The Ct-values of the real-time RT-PCRs using EDTA-blood as sample
material were between 19 and 25, demonstrating a high viral load.
Therefore, the laboratory data are indicative of recent
BTV-infections. In all cases, including the 1st outbreak of BTV
reported in June 2007 (ProMED Archive Number 20070613.1928), BTV
serotype 8 was confirmed by using serotype specific PCR and sequence analysis.
The diseased sheep were detected in 2 herds in North
Rhine-Westphalia, located close to the 1st BTV outbreak of the year
2007 in Germany confirmed on 6 June 2007. The diseased cattle was
detected in Rhineland-Palatinate approximately 25 km [15.5 miles]
from the border to North Rhine-Westphalia. All confirmed cases have
been detected within the German BTV protection zone established in 2006.
Based on these 4 new BTV-8 outbreaks in different locations within
the same region in 2007, it has to be concluded that BTV-8 has
started to re-circulate within the ruminant population.

[This 1st-hand, authoritative notification is very much appreciated.
It will be interesting to obtain data on the breed of the affected
sheep and about the species of culicoides vector involved in the
renewed transmission of the virus in Germany.
It will also be useful to hear about the availability of a BTV-8 vaccine.
BT surveillance results from Belgium, France and the Netherlands are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
