Close to 550 malaria cases in Ahmedabad, Gujarat
---------------------------------
Between January and April last year [2011], there were close to 550 malaria cases in the city. This year during the same period [January to April 2012] there are more than 1600 malaria cases - a number that is alarming considering the fact that these cases have surfaced way ahead before the onset of monsoons.

The state health department and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) have now sought help from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP), Delhi and National Institute of Malaria Research in Nadiad to tackle the problem.

The NVBDCP team will be headed by head of malaria division G S Sonal and will 1st meet epidemiologists in Gandhinagar and then visit the affected areas in the city.

The scientists will ascertain reasons of the rapid spread of the malarial parasite in the female anopheles mosquito called _Plasmodium vivax_ (PV). A key component to this study is parasite mapping - which calculates that the rate of occurrence of the parasite in mosquitoes.

The recent temperatures and humidity can also be considered a reason for the sudden spread of mosquitoes. This parasite generally has a gestation period of 12 to 14 days before its starts infecting humans. "Normally it's after 12 to 14 days of biting humans that the mosquito starts infecting. Mosquito happens to be cold blooded insect and needs temperatures and humidity levels greater than 70 per cent to proliferate. This condition seems to be available to them," says a senior health official in Gandhinagar.

Another aspect that epidemologists will examine is whether the malarial parasite has undergone some mutation - making it more potent over previous times. What is interesting is the fact that there have been just 130-odd cases of [_Plasmodium falciparum_] between January and April this year [2012].

For the time being, all construction sites in the city are being extensively surveyed for fever and physical conditions that may lead to mosquito breeding. Summers also involve lot of water storage in containers which may act as effective harboring points for mosquitoes.

13 000 pre-monsoon malaria cases in Maharashtra
-------------------------------
Rains are yet to arrive, and the state already has recorded over 13 000 cases of malaria and 3 deaths due to mosquito-borne infections. In the period between January and April [2012], 13 067 people have been found positive for malarial infection.

However, the good news is, this number point to more than 50 percent drop in mosquito-borne infections compared to the corresponding timeframe the last year [2011] when 28 400 cases were reported.

With 5374 positive cases and one death due to malaria in the last 4 months, Mumbai continues to be on the top of the list, followed by Gadchiroli (1789) and Thane (1317) districts.

"Climactic conditions with temperature up to 30 degrees Celsius and a humidity level above 70 percent are favourable conditions for mosquito-breeding. Such conditions prevailed on most days in the last 4 months in Mumbai. That is one of the reasons for malaria cases during the pre-monsoon period. It is usually during monsoon season that cases of malarial infection rise," said V D Khanande, joint director (malaria) of the state health services.During the same period last year [2011], Mumbai had recorded 16 833 positive cases and 11 deaths.

The rural parts of Pune recorded 86 malaria cases while the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) recorded 13 and 36 malaria cases respectively in the last 4 months [January through April 2012]. Elaborating, Khanande said, "The perceptible drop in positive malaria cases as well as deaths can be attributed to multi-pronged strategy initiated at all levels - from village to district - of planning and administration." Micro-planning, regular review meetings of planned work and consistent monitoring of mosquito breeding sites helped reduce outbreaks, he added. "Usually, water scarcity starts after March. This is the time when we have to strengthen our monitoring work. We started conducting meetings of additional district health officials to review their work once every month. Micro-planning, regular review meetings of planned work and awareness about avoiding mosquito breeding sites have yielded results," Khanande said.

In 2010-11, 138 605 positive cases were recorded in the state, a figure higher than the 85 435 cases recorded the previous year [2009?]. In 2007, 67 850 cases were registered and 67 333 cases were registered in 2008. To control the growing mosquito menace, the state health department had to seek technical support and expertise from the Union government.

As many as 545 people of the 3.29 lakh [329 000] patients succumbed to malaria in the last 3 years. In 2011, there were 118 deaths as against 200 the previous year [2010] and 227 in 2009. Experts said it is impossible to control mosquito breeding and bring down malaria without the active participation of the general public. "Unplanned growth of cities, rapid industrialisation, labour concentration at project sites and movement of population across the border are reasons for high number of malaria cases in the last few years. On the positive side, there has been a considerable reduction in cases and deaths since last year," said state entomologist B R Mane.

The components of the national malaria control strategy include use of long-lasting insecticides, bed nets, indoor residual sprays, early diagnosis and treatment of cases, management of the environment, forecasting, prevention and control of epidemics. Meanwhile, health activists attached to various NGOs [Non-governmental organizations] said the number of malaria, dengue and chikungunya cases is just the tip of the iceberg. A majority of the cases remain unreported.
