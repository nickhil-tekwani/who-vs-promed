WHO Officials Fear Outbreak in Gabon May Be Ebola Fever
-------------------------------------------------------
A total of 10 people has died in Gabon of a mystery illness that
authorities fear could be the deadly Ebola fever, officials at the World
Health Organisation (WHO) said on Fri 7 Dec 2001. Another possible Ebola
outbreak has left at least 17 people dead in the Democratic Republic of
Congo, where the disease was first discovered in 1976.

A member of a medical team who visited Gabon's northeastern Mekambo village
said a nurse was among the 10 victims. An Ebola fever outbreak in the same
region killed at least 66 people in 1996. Ebola fever, which causes victims
to bleed to death in a matter of days, is passed on through contact with
body fluids and begins with aches and fever similar to flu symptoms. There
is no known cure or vaccine and the mortality rate can be as high as 90%.
An WHO official said blood samples had been taken from victims, but the
results were not yet available.
