Two patients in a Scottish hospital have become the first in Britain to
contract a [bacterium resistant to nearly all known antibiotics,
hospital officials said Friday. Two elderly patients at Glasgow's Royal
Infirmary tested positive for a bacterial strain of the common
hospital-based staphylococcal infection that is partly resistant to
vancomycin, the antibiotic often used as a last resort.
"This is the first time we have identified this in Britain," Simon Barber,
a spokesman for the Public Health Laboratory Service in London, said. "This
is a serious situation because what it means is that in some situations the
range of antibiotics available for treatment is going to be reduced," he
added.
Doctors around the world have found thousands of cases where ordinary
staphylococcal infections have [involved a strain called MRSA, or
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_. They are then normally
treated with vancomycin.
Some newer strains found in the United States and elsewhere have even shown
signs of resistance to vancomycin. These are what Barber called VISA -- or
Vancomycin Intermediate-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_. "The strain is
not wholly resistant to drugs, but shows signs of developing total
resistance," Barber said.
One of the patients in Glasgow was reported to have been placed in
isolation at the hospital, but the other was being monitored at home.
Barber said neither patient actually got infected by the bacteria, but were
detected with it during routine testing.
"This particular strain ...it hasn't killed anybody so far. It's not
spreading like wildfire, in fact it hasn't spread to anybody," he added.
But the longer term concerns are serious. The problem stems from
rampant use of antibiotics, experts say. During a single human
generation of 25 years, bacteria go through 100 000
generations, according to the experts.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention has said the
problem is "urgent" and estimates some 50 million unnecessary
prescriptions are written for antibiotics each year in the United States.
U.S. doctors estimate as many as 70 percent of the bacteria in
infections that people get in hospital now are resistant to at least
one antibiotic.
