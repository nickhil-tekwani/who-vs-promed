From: Fearon, Margaret <Margaret.Fearon@moh.gov.on.ca>

We have what looks like may be a case of St. Louis encephalitis (acute
titre of <10, early convalescent titre of 40) in Toronto, in a 75 year-old
gentleman who returned from a visit to New York City in early September,
with clinical signs of encephalitis. He is currently in a coma in ICU. We
are awaiting a follow-up specimen - probably early next week.
