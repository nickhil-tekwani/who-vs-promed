The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has formally appealed to the
international community for assistance in its fight against Avian Influenza
(AI), according to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the
UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
North Korea's official appeal was made public at an international
conference on bird flu that ended in Paris today, jointly organised by
OIE/FAO, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO).
Around 300 key veterinary experts and scientists met to discuss the current
scientific information on bird flu and to address different aspects of
disease surveillance and control strategies.
North Korea has asked FAO and OIE to provide diagnostic tools and technical
assistance for disease control strategies, including vaccination.
OIE and FAO welcomed North Korea's request as a sign of improved
transparency and international cooperation. Both organisations said that
they are ready to extend their technical support to ensure an effective
control of the disease in the country.
FAO experts have already been fielded to Pyonyang and are currently
supporting the government in obtaining information on the extent of the
outbreaks and designing control strategies. OIE has been asked to assist in
the training of veterinary experts.
The FAO/OIE conference in Paris appealed to donor countries to provide more
funds for the fight against avian influenza in Asia for which around USD
100 million would be urgently required. So far, only Germany, Japan and The
Netherlands have expressed their willingness to financially support
affected Asian countries.
Many of the countries affected or threatened by AI are under-resourced and
lack the capacity of veterinary services for an effective and early
detection and response to the epidemic in poultry, the conference concluded.
Improving the efficiency of veterinary services in affected countries is
essential for controlling the disease at its source in poultry and
free-farmed ducks. Strategies are needed for financing sustainable,
concrete actions at local level. This is likely to include support for
restocking or compensation for losses and should also encompass education
on safe poultry keeping and development of appropriate infrastructures and
services.
Further scientific research is required to obtain more information on the
potential virus transmission from animals to humans. The conference also
urged laboratory networks coordinated by WHO, OIE/FAO to conduct research
on the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus and other avian influenza
viruses that could pose a potential threat to humans.
Veterinary and Public Health Services should better work together to
improve national, regional and global health security. Public Health
Services should support the agriculture sector and veterinary services in
order to control and eliminate the disease at its origin.
OIE and FAO announced the launch of the New Worldwide Avian Influenza
Network (OFFLU) which will improve the collaboration between reference
laboratories specialised on AI in animals, coordinated by OIE and FAO and
laboratory networks focusing on human influenza coordinated by WHO.
The network will speed up the immediate exchange of scientific data on bird
flu and animal virus strains to produce efficacious vaccines for humans
that respond to specific virus characteristics.
