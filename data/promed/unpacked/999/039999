Pacific Island countries and areas (PICs) are responding to outbreaks of measles with cases being reported for the 1st time since 2014.

A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO regions since 2017. In the Asia Pacific region, outbreaks of measles have been reported from countries where measles has previously been eliminated (including Australia, Cambodia, Japan, New Zealand, Republic of Korea) and in endemic countries with high incidence rates (including Lao PDR, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam).

The following is a brief update on the measles situation in Pacific Island countries and areas (PICs):

Samoa
On 16 Oct 2019, the Samoa Ministry of Health (MoH) declared a measles outbreak with a state of emergency being declared on 15 Nov 2019. From 1 Jan through 4 Dec 2019, a total of 4217 confirmed and suspected cases, including 62 measles-associated deaths, have been reported, with the majority of cases reported among children under 5 years of age.

In 2018, WHO-UNICEF estimated the national routine immunization coverage for the measles-containing-vaccine 1st dose (MCV1) and the measles-containing-vaccine 2nd dose (MCV2) to be 31% and 13%, respectively.

Tonga
On 22 Oct [2019], the Tonga Ministry of Health declared a measles outbreak. The 1st cluster of cases was among teenage rugby players who had travelled to Auckland, New Zealand. The outbreak has been characterized by transmission in schools and has affected mainly teenage males and young adults. A total of 84% (260 cases) of measles cases are reported in people between the ages of 10 and 24 years. As of 2 Dec 2019, a total of 440 cases of confirmed or suspected measles and no deaths have been reported. Most cases are males and have been reported from Tongatapu island. No measles-related deaths have been reported.

In 2018, the Tonga Ministry of Health estimated the national routine immunization coverage for MCV1 and MCV2 to be over 95% in Tonga.

Fiji
From 1 Jan-3 Dec 2019, a total of 15 confirmed cases of measles have been reported, of which 11 cases were from, or linked to, cases in Serua/Namosi subdivision, 2 were from Suva, and 2 were from Rewa subdivision. No measles-related deaths have been reported.

In 2018, WHO-UNICEF estimated the national routine immunization coverage for MCV1 and MCV2 to be 94% in Fiji.

Public health response
The Ministry of Health in each affected country is coordinating response efforts with support from WHO and partners. A more detailed public health response by country is summarized below:

Samoa
On 20 Nov 2019, Samoan authorities launched a mass vaccination campaign that initially targeted all boys and girls aged 6 months to 19 years and women aged 20-35 years (unless pregnant). On 2 Dec 2019, the target age group was expanded to include people aged 6 months to 60 years. As of 1 Dec 2019, over 77 000 doses of measles-containing-vaccine have been administered through the mass vaccination campaign initiated on 20 Nov [2019] by the Ministry of Health (MoH). Case management and clinical care services are overburdened, particularly the intensive care and paediatric wards in the main hospital of the capital, Apia. International emergency medical teams are supporting the clinical management of cases and helping to train health workers.

Tonga
Outbreak response immunization is ongoing for high-risk groups, including secondary school students and children. As of 3 Dec 2019, over 15 000 people have been vaccinated with MCV as part of outbreak response efforts.

Fiji
Response activities are ongoing, and over 100 000 people have been vaccinated in phase one of supplemental immunization activities (SIA). The next round of SIAs began on 4 Dec [2019] in key risk groups.

[3] Fiji: case count
Date: Sat 14 Dec 2019
Source: Outbreak News Today [abridged, edited]
http://outbreaknewstoday.com/fiji-measles-case-count-now-21-67155/


With the report of 2 additional confirmed measles cases in a 13-year-old from Nakelo Rewa and a 27-year-old from Naitasiri, this brings the total measles cases in Fiji to 21. Both cases are contacts with previously reported cases in their respective villages.

The 21 cases to date are from the following areas in the Central division:
12 cases from the Serua/Namosi subdivision (Wailali, Wainadoi, Navunikabi, and Makosoi Deuba);
4 cases from Suva subdivision (Samabula, Vatuwaqa, Tacirua, Wailekutu);
4 cases from Rewa subdivision (Koronivia, Nasilai Village Nakelo, Davuilevu);
1 case from Naitasiri subdivision (Saumakia Village).

Earlier this week, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services received 200 000 measles vaccines, funded by the Australian government.

"Australia is proud to assist the Fijian government's response to this measles outbreak," said Ms Anna Dorney, Australia's acting high commissioner to Fiji. "The Ministry of Health and Medical Services has been working tirelessly to ensure that this outbreak is contained. We are pleased to support their critical work to protect Fijians against measles."

Minister for Health and Medical Services Dr Ifereimi Waqainabete thanked the Australian government for their assistance: "These vaccines will enable us to continue our mass immunisation campaign, targeting those most at risk of measles infection."

While the main focus of the mass immunisation campaign has been on the Central division, where all cases are currently from, the latest supply of measles vaccines will be distributed to the rest of Fiji for the next phase of mass immunisation, which will continue to target people most at risk of catching and spreading the disease.

The Ministry of Health and Medical Services will announce details, including start dates, of the roll-out of the campaign to the rest of Fiji shortly.

[4] Tonga: faulty vaccine

Tonga and 2 international health agencies are investigating tens of thousands of faulty measles vaccines.

In November [2019], Tonga said it would re-vaccinate up to 20 000 people after dozens of people with measles were found to have received both vaccine doses.

Ministry of Health chief executive Dr Siale 'Akauola said it's assumed the vaccines were either poor quality or incorrectly stored. He said the Health Ministry is investigating alongside the World Health Organisation and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

According to the latest available data, there were 440 confirmed or suspected measles cases in Tonga.

Dr 'Akauola said Tonga was confident it had 99% immunisation coverage for measles until it discovered people sickened with the disease who had already received both doses of the vaccine.

"There have been at least 177 suspected cases of measles in the country since an October [2019] outbreak was declared.

Ministry of Health chief executive Siale 'Akau'ola said of those cases, 43 had a 2-dose recorded history of vaccination, which was recommended for protection against the virus.

"Even though some children have 2 doses, they still contracted the measles. That is an interesting finding. We have been trying to trace the vaccines that have been given, but they were given 15-16 years ago."

He said the vaccines or systems could have been inadequate in the past, but they were investigating the issue.

"We are assuming that the quality of the vaccines or the cold-chain systems of vaccination at the time were not of the best quality we have seen in the last 10 years, for example."

He stressed current systems had improved.

Dr 'Akau'ola said because there had been very few cases of measles below the age of 10 it was thought recent vaccinations had worked.

The Ministry of Health had sent teams out to high schools, initially in areas where there were pockets of outbreaks, to re-vaccinate people.

Dr 'Akau'ola said even those who had recorded 2 doses of vaccine would be administered new shots. He said the target group was people between the ages of 10 and 20.

Dr 'Akau'ola said most of the measles cases in Tonga had experienced only a mild illness."

[The mild nature of the cases suggests there was at least partial immunity, which gave some protection against severe disease. - Mod.LK]

[5] New Zealand: source of Samoan epidemic

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) has confirmed New Zealand as the likely source of Samoa's measles epidemic, compounding its responsibility for the disease's arrival.

Measles has killed 72 people in Samoa since October [2019] in a deadly catastrophe that has highlighted the country's low vaccination rates -- just 16% had both doses of the measles vaccine last year [2018] -- and the influence of a growing anti-vaccination movement there.

But critics have also blamed New Zealand for the epidemic.

Samoa's prime minister, Tuila'epa Sa'ilele Malielegaoi, and senior health officials have maintained that measles travelled to Samoa from New Zealand. In at least one instance, Tui'laepa has used this to argue that Samoa could not have done more to prepare itself for the disease's arrival.

The Samoan government reported that the 1st case arrived from New Zealand in late August [2019], according to an MFAT spokesperson.

"International travel means that measles can spread quickly from country to country. It is highly likely that New Zealand is the main source for the outbreak in Samoa," the spokesperson said.

The comments are the 1st public admission of responsibility for the epidemic after New Zealand government ministers either evaded questions on where the disease came from or outright denied New Zealand was the source.

On Friday [13 Dec 2019] afternoon, foreign affairs minister Winston Peters announced further medical support to assist with Samoa's measles epidemic. Peters said Samoa's health system had experienced a massive strain, and its health workers were facing exhaustion as they dealt with the number of patients needing care.

More than 5000 measles cases have been reported in Samoa since the outbreak began in mid-October [2019], and scores of infected people remain in the hospital.

Peters said more New Zealand medical specialists will travel to Samoa, providing support where needed.

The assistance includes Samoan-speaking medical personnel and trauma support, a Samoan-speaking biomedical engineer, up to 4 anaesthetists, and funding for a new oxygen generation.

[The current measles outbreak was declared in October [2019] after some members of a high school rugby team that had returned from New Zealand developed the illness.

The Tongan Futsal team was also quarantined after travelling to a regional tournament in New Caledonia through New Zealand.

Seven members of that team developed measles, including 4 who had been administered 2 doses of the vaccine in the past.

The Ministry of Health says there is no evidence to suggest new lines of transmission, apart from those who had been to New Zealand.

Measles outbreaks had also been declared in Samoa and Fiji.
