Scabies outbreak in nursing home
--------------------------------

A scabies outbreak was declared 26 Dec [2011] in Caser Montesoria
nursing home for the elderly in Logro√±o, which houses 70 inmates and
has 110 workers. Four residents and three workers are reported to be
affected, even though personnel is still working and inmates are
confined in their own rooms, with no isolation measures, while waiting
for the definitive control of this easily and rapidly transmitted mite
infection; nonetheless, this condition does not imply any severe
health risk.

Spokesmen from Caser Montesoria nursing home confirmed the outbreak,
but they assured that routine life there still is "completely normal".
"We have strictly followed the protocol; and inmates, their relatives,
workers and La Rioja Health Authorities have been completely informed
about this", they added.

Physicians working in the nursing home are treating the patients with
permethrin topical cream. "The outbreak was detected on 26 December;
and as of now, no more inmates have been reported as affected. How
scabies was introduced is not known."

Spokesmen from Caser Montesoria nursing home do not rule out that new
cases may occur in the near future, since first symptoms appear at 3-4
weeks after skin transmission, but they insist that "apart from
preventive and therapeutic measures that have been implemented since
the very 1st day the outbreak was detected, life in the nursing home
is completely normal."

Therapy with permethrine (a topical cream that is evenly applied all
over the skin of the whole body) is used for 3-5 days, and the course
is repeated after one week. Transmission is by skin contact, and also
through clothes, so it is necessary to have thorough cleaning of
clothes, sheets, blankets and other bedding. Spokesmen from Caser
Montesoria nursing home insist the situation does not represent any
alarm: "This is not an every day occurrence, but, anyway, the outbreak
is under control and it is not a condition that may represent any
severe risk for health, it is not even mandatory to report scabies
cases, but we have done so."

[Outbreaks of scabies in institutions are not unusual. Resistance to
[permethrin by] _Sarcoptes scabiei_ (the scabies mite) has been
reported. Another treatment possibility is ivermectin administered
orally which can be combined with permethrine dermally in
immunocompromised patients (Scott GR, Chosidow O; IUSTI/WHO. European
guideline for the management of scabies, 2010. Int J STD AIDS.
2011;22:301-3).
