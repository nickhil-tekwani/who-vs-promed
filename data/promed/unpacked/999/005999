CORRECTION: Chestnut Hill Farm at 750 SW 91st Place [Ocala, Marion County, Florida] is not under a Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services quarantine. A Wisconsin operation by the same name, which is temporally leasing property in Marion County for the HITS Ocala Circuit, is the quarantined facility. A press release issued by the state did not differentiate between the farms.

Two more Marion County farms were quarantined Monday [4 Mar 2013] after they were tied to an outbreak of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) at HITS' Post Time Farm.

While no new cases were found, the farms -- Hard Ford Farm in Reddick and Chestnut Hill Farm in Ocala -- were quarantined because horses that later developed the illness were housed on the property.

The latest orders brings to 9 the number of Marion County facilities quarantined by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

The 1st horse that tested positive on 21 Feb 2013 was located on the HITS [Horse shows In The Sun] showgrounds. Initially, the state only quarantined the tent where the affected horse was housed, but after other horses that had been at the show started testing positive, the entire facility was quarantined 27 Feb 2013.

Despite the quarantine on the grounds, HITS organizers have vowed to continue the competition, which runs through 17 Mar 2013 with the horses on site. No horses on the property when the quarantine was issued can leave the grounds. Other horses can enter, but will not be allowed to leave until the quarantine is lifted.

Several hundred horses are still on the property, but that number would be closer to 2000 on a typical weekend.

The virus is spread between horses through the air via sneezing and coughing. It does not affect humans. Humans, however, can spread the virus from horse to horse via contaminated hands, clothing, and shoes.

The state has quarantined 14 facilities linked to the HITS outbreak. The others include: Up Country Farm, Ocala [Marion County]; Redfield Farm, Ocala; Montera Farm, Ocala; Flutterby Farm, Ocala; Calder Farm, Ocala; Kings Ridge Farm, Reddick [Marion County]; Brookmore Farm, Oviedo [Seminole County]; Foxwood Farms, Pinellas Park [Pinellas County]; Black Forest Farm, St. Augustine [St. Johns County]; Littlewood Farm, Wellington [Palm Beach County]; and Miles Away Farm, Loxahatchee [Palm Beach County].

[2] Florida (central and northeast)

The state of Florida has now quarantined 13 farms [and the HITS showgrounds] in central and northeast Florida, after concerns over the spread of equine herpesvirus.

Black Forest Stables in St. Augustine [St. Johns County] is a boarding facility where 10 of the horses that may have been exposed during a recent horseshow in Ocala [Marion County] are now staying.

"This one I just bought," said Colleen Acosta as she showed Action News her newest horse. "I brought her to the tent for one day and now she's quarantined."

Acosta is a Texas horse trainer who came to Black Forest Stables after appearing at the HITS horse show in February [2012]. She was supposed to leave St. Augustine last week [week of 25 Feb 2013] for another show, but can't because the state is concerned her horses now carry the virus. "I had to call the vet and ask 'what is the worst, and will they ever come out of this, and how much danger am I in'?"

This particular strain of equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) may cause neurologic and respiratory disease and can be spread through feed buckets and grooming tools. Days after arriving at Black Forest, the virus struck the same HITS show barn where Acosta's horses had been during the competition. The state tracked her down soon after the discovery was made, and to stop it from spreading, enforced an immediate quarantine for 13 farms and the still-ongoing show for at least 21 days. "I feel like I'm in a better position than being at the horse show with everybody that's still exposed."

Jacksonville trainer and owner of Coriander Farms Katie Young still has 4 horses at the show, unable to come home. "Our horses are in a tent that has been cleared and we're keeping them far away from the paths that the sick horses took. We're hoping by the end of the show, which is 16 Mar 2013, that the quarantine will be lifted and it will be no consequence to us at all."

Florida's outbreak is affecting the industry nationwide, but both trainers believe the state is doing all it can under unusual circumstances. "Every day there is a new update on the situation, if more horses are infected or more barns are quarantined," says Young.

But there are still many unanswered questions, like how the outbreak started in the 1st place, and if horseshows will now enforce new regulations to prevent another outbreak in the future.

Acosta says the quarantine is inconvenient for her customers and other shows that were expecting bigger turnouts, but says the priority is the health and safety of the entire industry.

"The state will continue to check on us everyday until 11 Mar 2013, but at this point I feel like we're good. They're doing the right thing."

The Utah state veterinarian's office has now confirmed a total of 6 equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) cases, according to a 4 Mar 2013 statement from the office. 2 additional horses are exhibiting clinical signs and are undergoing tests, the statement said.

"The state veterinarian's office is restricting the movement of animals at 7 locations in Cache County as a precaution to prevent the spread of the disease," the statement read. "The outbreak remains confined to Cache County, as there have been no other reports of EHV-1 symptoms in horses in other areas of the state. Nonetheless, horse owners throughout Utah are advised to take extra biosecurity precautions when taking their animals to shows or public arenas."

The outbreak began 26 Feb 2013 when 2 horses tested positive for the disease; 2 additional horses were confirmed to be EHV-1 positive the following day. 2 horses have been euthanized as a result of the disease. The remaining animals are being treated and are under veterinary care, the statement read. The statement also noted that the Cache County Fairgrounds Horse Arena has closed until further notice because most of the horses had been at the facility recently. "Horse owners who have taken their animals to the Cache County Fairgrounds Arena during the past 30 days should monitor their horse's temperature and report concerns to their local veterinarian," the statement read.

"The state veterinarian recommends that horse facilities proceed with planned equine events, and that horse owners planning on traveling to an event should take their horse's temperature daily, beginning 3 days prior to travel and daily during the event," the statement read. "Horses with temperatures of 103 deg F [39.4 deg C] and above should not travel or mingle with other horses. Horses should be isolated for 2 weeks after returning home from an event, during which time they should be monitored for disease signs. "Statewide, no other horses have shown signs of EHV-1; however, the state veterinarian's office is advising Utah horse owners to take extra security measures to prevent unnecessary contact with possibly infected horses, and to quickly report clinical signs to their veterinarian.

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
