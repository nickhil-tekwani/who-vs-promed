A Response to the RFI Concerning a Case of Yellow Fever in Liberia
----------------------------------------------------------------
On 4 Jan 2001 ProMED-mail posted a Request For Information (RFI) regarding
a Yellow fever case with onset in December 2000 reported in Rivercess,
southwestern Liberia.
I travelled to Liberia in March 2001 and obtained verbal confirmation from
health officials in Monrovia on the serologically-confirmed case and 2
other possible cases. I also travelled to rural Rivercess and Sinoe
Counties. In the latter, I confirmed that a yellow fever vaccination
campaign had been conducted during January and February 2001.
I have finally just received by mail the official Ministry of Health report
on this yellow fever case and the outbreak response. I can make a summary
of the contents of this report available to anyone who may be interested.
There is no author listed on the report, which was provided through the
good offices of a colleague, a University of Liberia Professor of
Parasitology whose students participated in the vaccination campaign.
