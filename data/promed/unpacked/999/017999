[This posting was delayed when I tried to send it in remotely from
the International Congress on Infectious Diseases in Portugal last
week. Upon returning, I find there must have been a failure to
receive it properly from Portugal. My apologies for the delay on
this one but the conference was very informative.
H5N1 has been reported previously in Hungary. Rather than reinvent
the proverbial wheel, I have copied the comments of Mod.AS on Avian
influenza (134) - Hungary 20060610.1616 to provide background:
"H5 virus was initially confirmed in Hungary in mute swans on 15 Feb
2006, apparently in the vicinity of the current outbreak.
As a writing on the wall, posting 20060217.0519 included the
following statement: "Bacs-Kiskun is an important poultry-producing
region in Hungary's agricultural heartland, and there is a farm
housing 3000 ducks near the villages."
Hungary is a major goose-liver producer/exporter. The mute swan
infection was duly reported to the OIE; see Hungary's OIE notification at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_29.HTM#Sec20>.
According to EU's Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS), 12 wild
birds have been reported so far as infected in Hungary, with the last
date of confirmation being 13 Mar 2006. So far, 4 of the ADNS
countries -- Denmark, France, Germany and Sweden -- have reported
HPAI in domestic fowl subsequent to the discovery of infection in wild birds.
A WHO map, showing the region in southern Hungary where wild birds
were affected, is accessible at
