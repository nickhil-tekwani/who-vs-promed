Federal regulators are warning diners to use caution when ingesting raw oysters in 2014 amid recalls by shellfish farms in Massachusetts and Connecticut that have detected a saltwater-based bacteria that can cause severe illness and, in rare cases, death.

According to Bloomberg News, the CDC said vibrios spiked 75 percent in 2013 to the highest levels on record since 1996, when tracking of the bacteria's effects 1st started. "The CDC and 13 states have been monitoring vibrios' spread ... Experts say the bacteria has rarely been associated with shellfish farms along the east coast, but that is changing."

The CDC said vibriosis annually accounts for roughly 80 000 illnesses in the USA and that approximately one in 800 victims die from the infection once it is contracted. "We have seen the west coast version of vibriosis migrate to the East, and we don't know when it will strike again," David Plunkett, a senior staff attorney in the Center for Science in the Public Interest's food-safety program, told Bloomberg. "It's going to be dangerous for the industry, dangerous for consumers. The sad part is that we know how to control it."

According to Bloomberg, the rate of vibrio illnesses still trails most other food-borne infections such as campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, which is responsible for around 1.2 million illnesses in the USA each year.
