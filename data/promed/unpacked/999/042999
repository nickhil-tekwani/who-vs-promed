EHV-1 spread in equines, UK
---------------------------
1. Confirmed outbreak in Thoroughbreds - Cheltenham: 10-11 Mar 2003
EHV-1 [equine herpesvirus type 1] neurological disease was diagnosed at a
National Hunt racing yard near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, at the
beginning of the Cheltenham Festival. There are about 50 horses on the
yard, not vaccinated against EHV. 2 horses were affected with acute onset,
[characterised by] severe hind limb paresis/paralysis and recumbency within
a 24 hour period.
EHV infection was suspected and the yard was closed to all horse movement
in accordance with the Horserace Betting Levy Board's (HBLB) Codes of
Practice. Runners were withdrawn from the Festival. The 2 horses with
severe signs were euthanized and whole carcasses submitted to the Animal
Health Trust(AHT) for full postmortem examination. Frozen sections of brain
and spinal cord from both horses showed lesions typical of EHV paresis,
including areas of vasculitis, haemorrhage, and malacia. Immunoperoxidase
staining of the sections revealed herpesviral antigen in endothelial cells
and myocytes in the meninges, confirming the diagnosis of EHV-1 paresis.
Heparinised bloods, clotted bloods and nasopharyngeal swabs from all
contact horses have been submitted to the AHT laboratories. EHV-1 has been
isolated from a nasal swab taken from a third horse showing hindlimb
ataxia. Complement fixation (CF) titres at the time of ataxia in this case
were EHV1: 40 and EHV4: 80. This horse is recovering. EHV-1 has also been
isolated from heparinised blood from one of the contact horses. CF titres
at the time of sampling were EHV1: 320 and EHV4: 160. This horse was
showing no signs of disease.
2. Confirmed case in Thoroughbred - Arundel, East Sussex: 13 Mar 2003
Samples of medulla and spinal cord tissue from an 8 year old point-to-point
thoroughbred, received by the AHT on 13 Mar 2003, were found to be positive
for EHV-1 antigen by immunostaining. The horse had suffered acute onset,
hindlimb paralysis and was euthanised. No clinical problems have been
reported to date in about 30 other horses on the premises. Screening of
these contacts (heparinised bloods, nasopharyngeal swabs and paired sera)
is continuing. There is no apparent connection with the outbreak in
Cheltenham. We have advised that the yard remains closed.
3. Probable cases in non-horoughbreds -- Kent: (around) 13 Mar 2003
2 horses on a small showjumping yard (about 11 resident horses) in Kent
developed hindlimb ataxia within a period of 24 hours. The yard had
received a mare from Belgium about 2 weeks previously and the mare had
shown signs of acute depression 2 to 3 days before the ataxic cases
presented. None of the horses on the premises is vaccinated against EHV.
Very high EHV CF titres were detected in sera from the mare and one of the
ataxic horses sampled on 13 Mar 2003, suggesting (in the absence of
vaccination) that EHV-1 is a likely cause of the ataxia. The CF results were:
Mare [Belgian] -- no signs of ataxia, recovered from depression: EHV1:
=>640; EHV4: =>640
Ataxic horse 1: EHV1: = 640; EHV4: =>640
Ataxic horse 2: EHV1: =80; EHV4: =20
So far, no signs of disease have been reported in the other horses on the
premises and screening is continuing. The yard remains closed.
4. Probable case in thoroughbred -- Kent: 17 Mar 2003
A 15 year old thoroughbred gelding on a large livery yard (40 to 60
resident horses in total) in Bromley, Kent developed ataxia on 17 Mar 2003.
Signs progressed to severe ataxia and paresis, dog-sitting, and urinary
retention. The animal was euthanized on 19 Mar 2003. EHV CF titres from a
serum sample taken on the day of euthanasia were EHV1: 320 and EHV4: 80,
suggesting that EHV-1 is a likely cause of the ataxia. None of the horses
on the premises is vaccinated against EHV. A large number of the other
resident horses are currently showing signs of respiratory disease.
Nasopharyngeal swabs, paired sera, and heparinised blood from all resident
horses and frozen tissues from the euthanized horse are to be submitted to
the AHT for examination. The yard remains closed. It has not yet been
established whether there is a possible connection with the other probable
cases in Kent.
Unusual features of these cases?:
All cases reported so far are in unvaccinated, non-breeding or performance
horses. Ataxia has been seen in some horses with relatively low (about 80)
EHV CF titres. Further developments will be posted.

[We thank Jackie Cardwell for the information on the said outbreaks which
seem to occur almost simultaneously in 4 separate, distant locations in
England. Their neurological nature, indicating systemic infection, is less
common than the respiratory syndrome caused by EHV-1. EHV-1 is an enzootic
virus in all countries in which large populations of horses are maintained.
In horses under 3 years of age, clinical ER usually takes the form of an
acute, febrile respiratory illness that spreads rapidly through the group
of animals; hence its common name, equine rhinopneumonitis (ER), which is a
List B disease (caused also by EHV-4). By far the greatest clinical threats
to individual breeding, racing, or pleasure horse operations posed by ER
are the potential abortigenic and neurological sequelae of EHV-1
respiratory infection. EHV-1 (and EHV-4) neurological disease may affect
any age or gender of horse, including mares within a group in which
abortion is occurring.
Although the range and severity of neurological signs associated with EHV-1
infection are broad, some form of hindlimb incoordination and weakness is
common to most cases. More severely affected animals may exhibit further
progression to either hindlimb or quadripedal paralysis, accompanied by
sternal or lateral recumbency. Both morbidity and mortality rates in horses
with EHV-1 neurological disease are highly variable from outbreak to
outbreak. Following recovery from ER, horses usually remain latently
infected with the virus for life. More information on ER diagnosis,
prevention, and control is available in the Office International des
Epizooties manual of standards, diagnostic tests and vaccines, 2000,
chapter 2.5.7. <http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00075.htm>. Recent
references can be found there as well. - Mod.AS]
