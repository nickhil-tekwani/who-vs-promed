Recent rain on the southern tablelands of New South Wales has led to outbreaks of botrytis in some vineyards, ruining up to half of some red wine grape crops.

Botrytis is a fungus which grows on the outside of berries and can change the flavour and colour of the fruit.

[A grape grower] says his shiraz grapes have been badly affected. "If we don't get [the grapes] off now, the botrytis will just run away, and we won't get any crop at all. Probably about half [have dropped] on the ground."

[The fungus _Botrytis cinerea_ can cause serious losses in both yield and fruit quality of grapevine. It causes lesions on leaves and also infects shoots, flowers and fruit leading to bunch rot. If blossoms are infected, the fungus remains latent until berries begin to soften. Infection is optimal at 15-20 C [59-68 F] with free water or over 90 percent humidity.

Grape cultivars with dense canopies, thin skins, and/or tight clusters are more susceptible. The rot may progress to infect berry clusters or whole bunches, and girdling lesions on the stems may lead to drying and premature fruit drop. Affected berries may split open, develop a grayish mold on the surface, and may shrivel in dry conditions.

The pathogen overwinters on plant material and is spread by water, wind, mechanical means, and juice from split berries. Mechanical damage caused by birds or insects creates entry points for the fungus and can greatly increase losses. Disease management relies mainly on fungicide applications, phytosanitation and cultural practices.

_B. cinerea_ also causes blights and grey molds on a wide range of hosts, including many crops such as brassicas and other vegetables, fruit crops and peanut.
