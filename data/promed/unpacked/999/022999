Several people worried they may have symptoms of typhoid have been referred to emergency departments a day after authorities revealed an outbreak in Auckland.

The Ministry of Health's Healthline service said they had received about 30 calls from people concerned about having symptoms. Those symptoms include: a high fever developing over several days, headaches, general weakness, and muscle aches. Other common symptoms are constipation and stomach pain, while some people may also get diarrhoea.

Healthline spokesman Calvin Cochran told the NZ Herald a number of people who had phoned through were told to go straight to their local emergency department. "Quite a few of those calls had to be referred on for further care -- a few people who were just a bit worried and a few people who did actually have the symptoms of typhoid,'' he said. People who were experiencing those symptoms were urged to get in touch with the 24-hour, 7-day hotline, which puts people directly through to a registered nurse. There they can speak with a nurse and determine whether or not any further action should be taken. "Otherwise, if they feel more comfortable, they can go to their GP. It is the weekend, so it might be a bit tough."

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service [ARPHS] yesterday [31 Mar 2017] confirmed an outbreak of the disease had led to 10 people having to be hospitalized.

The source of the outbreak has not yet been revealed, but those hospitalized are said to be from Mt Roskill, Blockhouse Bay, and Manurewa [all suburbs of Auckland].

The disease is mainly spread through water and food, but can also spread from person to person.

The ARPHS has not issued any other updates or advisories 24 hours later, nor responded to Herald requests for an update on the situation.

A spokeswoman for Middlemore Hospital confirmed they had one typhoid patient who was in a stable condition.

Auckland City Hospital referred all typhoid-related questions to the ARPHS.

[_Salmonella enterica_ subspecies Typhi is, unlike most other salmonellae, not a zoonotic pathogen but is rather essentially a pathogen of humans. The classical illness caused by _S._ Typhi is enteric fever, a mostly undifferentiated febrile illness usually without diarrhea. The pathogen is spread classically from contaminated food or water. ProMED awaits more information regarding the source of this outbreak. - Mod.LL
