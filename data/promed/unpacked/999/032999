Anthrax in Guinea Bissau
---------------------------
This is a copy of the joint appeal launched by the Ministers of Agriculture
and Health of Guinea Bissau regarding an outbreak of anthrax in the Oio
region of Guinea Bissau:
Appeal to control the Carbuncle epidemic in Guinea Bissau:
During the 3rd week of April 2005, in Mansoa Hospital, Oio Region, clinical
analysis on patients confirmed the existence of _Bacillus anthracis_,
responsible for Hematic Carbuncle disease, better known as anthrax. On 22
Apr 2005, the Minister of Health declared the Oio Region affected by a
carbuncle epidemic and appealed for urgent support for an emergency
vaccination campaign to control the epidemic and to prevent the spread of
the disease to the nearby Capital town of Bissau or to bordering Senegal
through infected cattle. Notwithstanding that carbuncle is a disease that
affects mainly animals, humans can become infected with anthrax by handling
products from infected animals. People also can become infected with
gastrointestinal anthrax by eating undercooked meat from infected animals
(source: CDC Atlanta web site).
Up to 28 Apr 2005, 80 cases of human infection have been reported,
including 13 hospitalizations, resulting in 4 casualties [deaths
presumably]. The affected area is, for the time being, restricted to the
Mansaba sector within the Northern Region of Oio. In 12 villages affected,
126 bovine deaths have been reported. Lack of knowledge of the disease by
the local population is increasing the risk of the spreading of the disease.
The Oio Region's economy depends, for a significant part, on animal
husbandry exercised by small farmers in a regime of subsistence. The
estimated cattle population in the capital is approximately 173 500
animals, including 52 128 bovines. The impact of the anthrax epidemic could
be disastrous for the region in the event it is not quickly controlled.
The Ministries of Health and Agriculture have no means available to
intervene and are appealing to the international community, aiming to
obtain support for containing the epidemic and to avoid the risk of
propagation to the neighboring Regions and Countries.
The immediate request done by the Ministries of Health and Agriculture include:
Bacteria Vaccine [Sterne vacccine?, - Mod.MHJ]: 200 000 doses
Symptomatic Vaccine: 200 000 doses
Oxycicline 20 percent (Oxytetracicline): 500 flacons[vials]/100 ml
Terramicine [Teramycin]: 300 flacons [vials]/100 ml
Syringe automatic for vaccination: 30 units /30cc
Syringe automatic for vaccination: 30 units /10cc
Wasting Material as appropriate
Support for vaccination brigades: USD 22 000
The value of the request is approximately USD 90 000.

[This report is at odds with Guinea-Bissau's routine report to OIE of not
having even one case of livestock anthrax in a region of Africa where the
disease is frequently rampant. Failure to report is not a cause for not
helping. So this is posted to bring awareness of their problems to a wider
audience. - Mod.MHJ]

[I referred the communication above [1] to my knowledgeable colleague,
Peter Turnbull, for his take on it. - Mod.MHJ]
[Geneva] told me about this outbreak about 2 weeks ago and indicated that
response was in the hands of OIE and FAO. This is the 2nd time in a few
months we have seen this call for financial aid for dealing with anthrax,
the other being the Uganda hippo epidemic.
Do we know they have got the diagnosis correct? Have OIE/FAO satisfied
themselves of that? [Good question! - Mod.MHJ] If it is correct, the 1st
action should be public education in not butchering and eating meat from
sudden death animals. I suspect the bigger problem now is the hides (and
bones??) which have been sold off elsewhere, but these may well still be
drying outside the houses of the owners, in which case, they need to be
confiscated before they do get sold off. (The letter does say lack of
knowledge of the disease by the local population is a risk factor.
Hopefully, they are already addressing that.)
Vaccination of cattle should, of course, have begun. In the list we have of
countries which have producers of the livestock vaccine, the nearest are
Mali and Niger; others in Africa are Kenya, Zambia and South Africa.
I have no idea what is meant by "Symptomatic vaccine," I'm afraid. [Nor do
I - Mod.MHJ]. Human vaccine is to all intents and purposes unavailable. But
even if it were, identifying the individuals at genuine risk would be
nearly impossible and, as always with natural anthrax, control in humans is
best exerted by control in their animals together with the relevant public
health measures already described.
For humans, and animals too, penicillin is the best choice, possibly with
streptomycin, at least in the animals. Remember, I am not a clinician
(human or animal!).
I hope this is of some help.

[Many thanks, Peter. The bible on anthrax is the WHO Anthrax Guide,
available on line at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/anthrax/WHO_EMC_ZDI_98_6/en/>
This covers treatment regimes for humans and animals. - Mod.MHJ]
[In the WHO Anthrax Guide, the recommendations for treatment state: "Prompt
and timely antibiotic therapy usually results in dramatic recovery of the
individual or animal infected with anthrax. Almost all isolates of B.
anthracis can be expected to be highly sensitive to penicillin and, being
cheap and readily available in most parts of the world, this remains the
basis of treatment schedules, particularly in animals and in humans in
developing countries. The organism is also sensitive to numerous other
broad spectrum antibiotics; should the use of penicillin be
contraindicated, a wide range of alternative choices exist from among the
aminoglycosides, macrolides, quinolones and tetracyclines. Chloramphenicol
is also a satisfactory alternative."
In the USA, there was a conference held in November 2001 in response to the
intentional anthrax outbreak in the USA that year. A summary of the
recommended treatment for anthrax can be found in Bell DM, Kozarsky PE,
Stephensin DS. Clinical Issues in the Prophylaxis, Diagnosis, and Treatment
of Anthrax, EID (8)/2 February 2002
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no2/01-0521.htm>.
65 isolates were tested and all those associated with the 2001 outbreak
were sensitive to the quinolones, rifampin, tetracycline, vancomycin,
imipenem, meropenem, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and the aminoglycosides.
The summary addresses the issue of not using penicillins: "The decision
regarding the use of penicillins, the drugs historically used for treatment
and prophylaxis of anthrax, is complicated. An inhibition assay shows
beta-lactamase activity at low levels in the isolates. Genomic sequence
data show two beta-lactamases: a potential penicillinase (class A) and a
cephalosporinase (class B), which is expressed. Concern about the use of
penicillin arises because an inducible penicillinase could be activated in
the face of treatment with beta-lactams, particularly if the number of
organisms present is high, as appears typical with inhalational disease.
Concerns have also been raised about the poor penetration of beta-lactams
into macrophages, the site where B. anthracis spores germinate."
At present the recommendations are for use of the Ciprofloxacin or
doxycycline with the caution that the latter should not be used if
meningitis is suspected as central nervous system penetration is
insufficient for treatment purposes. A multidrug regimen is suggested when
bacteremia is present, using either ciprofloxacin or doxycycline along with
one or more agents to which the organism is typically sensitive. - Mod.MPP]
