Hunter Local Land Services District Veterinarians are reminding producers to practice good farm biosecurity following the detection of cattle tick and tick fever on the NSW [New South Wales] Mid North Coast at Kendall.

Around 70 head of cattle have died as a result of tick fever across several properties.

Several properties in the area are now undergoing a NSW Department of Primary Industries supervised cattle tick eradication program. This includes tracing of cattle movements and monitoring and treating cattle to eradicate the tick and tick fever. A number of additional properties also have movement restrictions in place until it can be proven cattle tick has not entered those properties.

Quarantining new or returning stock onto your property and providing suitable livestock health treatments to rid the animal of pests, disease and weeds is an effective method to stop issues crossing your farm gate said Dr Lyndell Stone, District Veterinarian with Hunter Local Land services.

"Issues like this are a reminder to all producers that we must be vigilant with our biosecurity practices to prevent bringing diseases, pests and weeds onto our farms," said Dr Stone.

"Holding new cattle in a yard and treating for internal and external parasites as well as vaccinating for key diseases is really a "must do" if you want to protect your stock and your farm.

"There are a range tickicides and anthelmintics that treat for cattle tick as well products for other external parasites that may be a problem in different seasons, a combination drench is also a good choice for internal parasites and liver fluke."

Dr Stone said regular monitoring and maintaining stock proof fencing is also essential.

"While cattle are in your quarantine yard or small paddock, they should be inspected daily for any signs of disease or pest infestation and only let out with other stock and access to the wider property when you are confident they are healthy and not harbouring diseases, pest or weed seeds," Dr Stone said.

"Cattle tick is endemic in parts of Queensland, but fortunately is only very rarely identified in the southern parts of the North Coast of NSW, and these cases are then eradicated."

Cattle tick can carry a protozoal parasite that is injected into cattle when ticks attach and feed. The parasite causes fever, depression, and anaemia. Affected animals may stagger, show nervous signs and have red coloured urine (redwater).

Hunter Local Land Services can help with tick identification to distinguish between cattle, paralysis, and bush ticks. The key to identifying cattle ticks is their pale coloured legs and leg position.

"Investigating unusual illness in livestock and safeguarding agriculture is a key role of the District Vet team" said Dr Stone. "But, we rely on producers to work with us and report unusual illness, exactly as the producers have done in this instance.

"Early reporting of an issue gives us the best chance of containing and eradicating a disease threat."

Please contact your nearest Local Land Services office if you have any further questions about identifying ticks or biosecurity on your property on 1300 795 299.

[Tick fever is a cattle disease caused by any one of the following blood parasites:
- _Babesia bovis_
- _Babesia bigemina_
- _Anaplasma marginale_

These parasites are all transmitted by the cattle tick (_Rhipicephalus microplus_; see photo at http://www.nhc.ed.ac.uk/images/collections/ticks/hard/image017.jpg)

Disease caused by _B. bovis_ or _B. bigeminya_ is called babesiosis, often referred to as 'red water'. Disease caused by _A. marginale_ is called anaplasmosis.

_B. bovis_ is the most important parasite, causing more than 80 percent of outbreaks of tick fever in Queensland each year.

Clinical signs of tick fever include weakness, depression, loss of appetite.
These signs are mainly due to the associated fever and red blood cell destruction (causing anaemia).

Despite the common name 'red water', red urine is only occasionally present and late in the course of the disease. Other clinical signs may include jaundice and neurological signs.

Cattle with _B. bovis_ infections may be quite sick even in the absence of anaemia and red urine.

It is difficult to diagnose tick fever based on clinical signs alone. The best way to diagnose tick fever is to send blood smears to a laboratory for examination.

Risk factors for tick fever
---------------------------
Breed. British, European, and other _Bos taurus_ cattle breeds are more susceptible to tick fever caused by _Babesia_ organisms than Brahman and _Bos indicus_ breeds. Cross breeds (_B. taurus_ x _B. indicus_) have intermediate susceptibility determined by the percentage of each breed type.
All breeds, including _B. indicus_ breeds, are highly susceptible to disease caused by _Anaplasma marginale_.

Age. There is a strong link between age and resistance. Most outbreaks occur in animals 18 to 36 months of age. Calves exposed to tick fever organisms between 3 to 9 months of age rarely show clinical signs and develop a solid, long-lasting immunity.

Exposure. Cattle born and raised in areas where cattle ticks are endemic can develop natural immunity through exposure to ticks infected with tick fever. However, exposure of calves to ticks infected with tick fever (and subsequent development of protective immunity) can be highly unpredictable. Exposure is influenced by factors such as breed, season, and tick-control strategies.
All cattle raised in areas free from cattle ticks are at risk of tick fever if introduced into areas where ticks are present.
