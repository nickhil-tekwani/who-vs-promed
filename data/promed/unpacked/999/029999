Fisheries officials issue shellfish warning for area outside Halifax
--------------------------------------------------------------------
HALIFAX (CP): The federal Fisheries Department has issued a shellfish
warning for an area outside of Halifax bounded by Duncan's Cove, Pennant
Point, and Sambro Island. Routine testing has revealed the presence of the
paralytic shellfish toxin or red tide. Many people like to pick mussels
from tidal pools in the area. The ban is indefinite.

[Red tide is caused by an organism called _Gymnodinium breve_, which in
high concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept people
from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and throats. Red tide
irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can cause itchy eyes,
scratchy throats, and coughs.
Harvesting from affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red
tide poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness, which may last for
several days. - Mod.TG]
