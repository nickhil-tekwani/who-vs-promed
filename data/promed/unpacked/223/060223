Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Cape Town Confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------
A worker from the Maitland abattoir in Cape Town, South Africa, is being
treated at Groote Schuur Hospital for confirmed Congo-Crimean Hemorrhagic
Fever (CCHF). The patient appears to be improving and is in a stable
condition, after more than a week with features of severe DIC [disseminated
intravascular coagulation. The patient was admitted to Groote Schuur
Hospital on Sun 4 Feb 2001 with a febrile illness of unproven etiology. He
was admitted to a general medical ward, as he was suspected of having a
_Salmonella_ infection. Viral hemorrhagic fever was first suspected on Fri
9 Feb 2001, on the basis of the scoring system designed by R. Swanepoel et
al. (1987). The patient scored 16-17/20, whereas only 12 points are
required for a clinical diagnosis. The patient was immediately placed in
isolation with appropriate barrier nursing put in place.
Blood samples (both fresh and those retrieved from other routine GSH
laboratories) were sent to the Special Pathogens Unit of the National
Institute of Virology in Johannesburg, to be tested for CCHF.
(A) The initial RT-PCR and IgG assays were negative on all specimens, while
the IgM assay showed the early specimens to be negative and the specimen
from Fri 9 Feb 2001 to be "trace positive."
(B) Later blood specimens taken on 11 and 12 Feb 2001 were positive for
both CCHF IgM and IgG. (RT-PCR not done)
(C) Viral culture results (incubated for 3 days) received from the Special
Pathogens Unit on Tue 13 Feb 2001 were positive for virus isolation on the
previous week's specimens.
About 350 people who came into contact with the patient after he became
ill, including family members and close friends, fellow abattoir workers
and hospital personnel who treated him, are being actively monitored on a
daily basis. To date no contact person has been shown to have features
compatible with CCHF.
This is the first case of CCHF ever reported from a Cape Town abattoir,
although abattoirs in other parts of the country have experienced this
problem. Every attempt has been made to ensure that Cape Town residents are
aware that there is no risk to them as a result of eating meat from this
(or any other) abattoir.
