A case of fever caused by [a] hantavirus [infection] was registered in the Tonosí community in Los Santos province. This is the 1st case in the 1st 8 months of the year [2016]. The individual is a 28 year old young man who is in a stable condition in the Tonosí Rural Hospital.

Carlos Muñoz, the regional coordinator of epidemiology of Los Santos health region, stated that the patient is a farmer who was admitted on 23 Aug [2016]; it was expected that in the required time for the test, it will be positive, but the [patient] progressed favorably.

Muñoz stated that so far this year [2016] tests have been done on 27 people suspected of having [a] hantavirus [infection], but all have been negative. As for the capture of the [rodent] species that transmits [the virus], it has been very low, according to the Ministry of Health.

"Every 4 years, the mouse population increases and so do the cases of hantavirus [infection], but this year [2016] the numbers are low," Muñoz stated.

Last year [2015] closed with 15 cases, where most were registered in the Tonosí district.

[Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. In the report above, no mention is made of the ecological setting in which the infection occurred, but since the patient is a farmer, he probably acquired his infection in an agricultural area. The croplands and food sources of the area, such as stored grain, attract the rodent host of Choclo virus. The preventive measures indicated in this and previous reports include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
