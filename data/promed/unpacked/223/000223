A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says ticks are causing a deadly Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) epidemic in Mexico, and health officials are concerned it could spread to the US. Dr Luis Tinoco-Gracia, a research professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine at Universidad Autónoma de Baja California and director of the Laboratory of Veterinary Public Health Sciences, in Mexicali, Mexico, and colleagues from the University of California, Davis published the report in the September 2018 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the CDC's public health journal [1].

The RMSF epidemic began in 2008 in Mexicali, adjacent to the US border in Baja California. In 2014, a fatal human case was reported in Imperial County, California. In 2015, the Mexican Ministry of Health declared an epidemiologic emergency, which as of 2018 has affected approximately 4000 people. Since that time, 4 people who have been carrying the disease and crossed the border to the US have died.

"Overall, since 2000, in the United States, the incidence of RMSF has reportedly increased 4-fold; this dramatic increase may be caused in part by increased transmission via the brown dog tick, but also by changes in reporting and inclusion of false-positive test results in case diagnoses."

RMSF, caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is responsible for more human deaths than any other tickborne disease in North America, according to the authors, citing a total of 80 fatal cases reported from Sonora, Mexico, during 1999 to 2007.

According to the authors, the brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) has more recently emerged as a vector of _Rickettsia rickettsii_, which increases the threat to humans because of _R. sanguineus_' ability to adapt to indoor living.

The RMSF epidemic in Mexicali has not been contained and may be spreading to other parts of Baja California and into the US, according to the authors. "This large epidemic in a major city will require a far greater and more creative public health response," the authors continued. "Studying this epidemic offers an opportunity to understand the origin and dynamics of this epidemic and can inform response to emerging tickborne diseases in general."

Abstract
--------
"Since 2008, a large epidemic of Rocky Mountain spotted fever has been emerging among humans and dogs in Mexicali, adjacent to the United States in Baja California, Mexico. We molecularly confirmed the causative agent; this information can be used to study the origin and dynamics of the epidemic.

"Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), caused by the bacteria _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is responsible for more human deaths than any other tickborne disease in North America (1). During 1999-2007, a total of 80 fatal cases were reported from Sonora, Mexico, alone (2). Recent epidemics in Arizona (USA) and Sonora have been associated with the brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) (3,4), whereas most cases in the United States have been transmitted by bites of infected _Dermacentor_ spp. ticks (5). The risk to humans is heightened by the epidemiologic cycle of the brown dog tick, a cosmopolitan tick that prefers the dog as its host and can live its entire life cycle in a periurban setting, often spending its off-host time indoors. _R. sanguineus_ ticks, in addition to being vectors of _R. rickettsii_, are probable or confirmed vectors of _Leishmania_, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _R. conorii_ (6).

"The study
----------
"In 2008, an epidemic of RMSF began in Mexicali, adjacent to the US border in Baja California, Mexico. In 2015, the Mexican Ministry of Health declared the epidemic an epidemiologic emergency, which as of 2018 has affected [about] 4,000 persons. In 2014, a fatal human case in Imperial County, CA, USA, was probably associated with the Mexicali epidemic. Overall, since 2000, in the United States, the incidence of RMSF has reportedly increased about 4-fold (7); this dramatic increase may be caused in part by increased transmission via the brown dog tick but also by changes in reporting and inclusion of false-positive test results in case diagnoses.

"Local response to the ongoing epidemic in Mexicali has involved the Secretariat of Health and doctors and researchers at the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California schools of medicine and veterinary medicine. During 2008-2009, in the impoverished neighborhood of Los Santorales in Mexicali, at least 13 persons died of RMSF. Under agreement with the Sector Salud de Mexicali, the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California veterinary team documented 81% seroprevalence among local dogs and confirmed active _R. rickettsii_ infection in a human resident by conducting PCR of kidney tissue (8). Of 120 persons from Mexicali with clinical signs compatible with RMSF, 30 were positive by PCR for the gene gltA, according to an unpublished method (9). In 2014, the local team partnered with researchers at the University of California, Davis (Davis, California, USA), to further molecularly characterize the strains of _R. rickettsii_ and _R. sanguineus_ ticks from Mexicali. We provide definitive molecular confirmation of the identity of the disease agent causing the Mexicali epidemic.

"The University of California, Davis, laboratory received DNA extracted by use of QIAGEN Blood and Tissue Kits (Valencia, CA, USA) from 16 cases from Mexico. Initial _R. rickettsia_-specific real-time PCR for the citrate synthase gene (10) was positive for 10 samples. To obtain products for DNA sequencing, we performed traditional PCR for the ompA and 17kDa genes as published (11,12).

[...]

"We successfully obtained ompA and 17kDa products from 5 samples and compared the sequences with those in the GenBank database by using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). For ompA, the resulting 472-bp amplicons from the 5 products from Mexicali were 100 percent similar. For this gene, numerous accessions in GenBank also have 100 percent homology with 100 percent coverage, including strains Sheila Smith, Hauke, Hilo, Colombia, and Arizona. Sequences of 17kDa spanned 206 bps and were also completely homologous among them. This gene did not differentiate to species but was 100 percent homologous with _R. rickettsii_, _R. parkeri_, and others in the database. Representative sequences from Mexicali were submitted to GenBank (accession nos. KY689935 for ompA and KY824575 for 17kDa).

"Among sequence-confirmed samples, data were not available for 1 sample. The other 4 samples were collected in June, July, and September 2013 and April 2014. 2 samples were from men (41 and 25 years of age) and 2 from women (18 and 29 years of age); all patients had dogs with ticks. Signs and symptoms were fever and headache for all; for 1 patient, a rash and convulsions also developed. The 2 men died and the 2 women survived with treatment. All patients had home addresses in various parts of Mexicali, including central west, southwest, and southeast bordering agricultural land. Clinical data were not available for patients for whom samples were considered PCR positive but not sequence confirmed, although inclusion of such clinical data and risk factors could bias interpretation if they were false positive or only weakly positive.

"Conclusions
------------
"The RMSF epidemic in Mexicali has not been contained and may be spreading to other parts of Baja California and into the United States. More data are needed before we can understand why this epidemic emerged, where the specific areas of high risk for exposure to infected ticks are located, and whether the particular _R. rickettsii_ strain or relationship with this _R. sanguineus_ tick strain is likely to be particularly invasive or virulent. Pockets of RMSF have occurred in Mexico since at least 1947, when cases attributable to the brown dog tick in Sonora, Sinaloa, Coahuila, and Durango were described (13). Given the very limited phylogeographic resolution available for _R. rickettsii_ in many of the commonly used PCR products (14), it is not known whether the bacteria in the Mexicali epidemic originated from Sonora or more distantly. Next steps include obtaining a culture of the bacteria from Mexicali, studying bacterial virulence in vitro or in animal models, and assessing vector competence of the Mexicali _R. sanguineus_ tick strain for _R. rickettsii_. Epidemiologic data on the spatial distribution and prevalence of infection in dogs are needed.

"Aggressive intervention achieved partial and temporary resolution of the Arizona and Sonora epidemics, which were localized and relatively small; these interventions included dog spay and neuter programs, treatment of houses against ticks, and use of a long-acting tick collar (Seresto; Bayer, Shawnee Mission, KS, USA) directly on the dogs (15). However, the dog collars were initially donated and are prohibitively expensive and not feasible for the scope of the Mexicali epidemic. This large epidemic in a major city will require a far greater and more creative public health response. Studying this epidemic offers an opportunity to understand the origin and dynamics of this epidemic and can inform response to emerging tickborne diseases in general."

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tickborne rickettsiosis, caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_. RMSF is distributed through much of the USA, parts of southern Canada, and Central and South America.

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Rocky Mountain spotted fever - Mexico: (SO, BN) fatal, susp, RFI 20130831.1915146:

"The primary ticks that transmit _R. rickettsii_ in the United States include the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_), Rocky Mountain wood tick (_D. andersoni_), and brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/). A female _D. variabilis_ (the American dog tick) can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm#fig1. _R. rickettsii_ is passed transovarially from adult females to their progeny (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014489463900195).

"In 2003, investigators in Mexicali, Mexico were reported to have conducted an entomologic survey to determine the prevalence of the brown dog tick _R. sanguineus_ among 94 stray and privately owned dogs in the city and determined that 60 per cent of these animals were infested with _R. sanguineus_, a prevalence far greater than reported in other areas of Mexico and other parts of the world (Paddock CD, Telford SR III. Through a glass, darkly: The global incidence of tick-borne diseases. Available at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK57015/

"Subsequently, a large urban outbreak of RMSF that involved over 1000 cases occurred in Mexicali, Mexico in 2009. The Mexicali outbreak was linked to transmission by the brown dog tick, and spread through infected ticks by stray and free-roaming dogs. In 2009, surveys for _R. sanguineus_ identified these ticks in all 14 districts of Mexicali, where 96 per cent of the cases occurred (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK57015/).

"RMSF has also been reported along the US side of the border. During 2010, Arizona reported 41 cases associated with tribal lands, transmitted by the brown dog tick _R. sanguineus_ and also involved roaming dogs and heavy infestations of brown dog ticks that resulted in peri-domestic transmission and clustering of cases (Buelow ML. The epidemiology of rickettsial diseases on the US Mexico border: An analysis of incidence rates, clinical presentation and risk factors associated with _Rickettsia rickettsii_, _Rickettsia typhi_, and _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ infection. Available at: https://legacy-etd.library.emory.edu/view/record/pid/emory:92fnd

"The Mexican _R. rickettsii_ have been reported to differ genetically from isolates in other endemic regions of northern, central, and southern Americas; _Rhipicephalus_ ticks in Mexicali are also said to differ genetically from _R. sanguineus_ found in the United States (Eremeeva ME, Zambrano ML, Anaya L, et al. _Rickettsia rickettsii_ in _Rhipicephalus_ ticks, Mexicali, Mexico. J Med Entomol. 2011; 48(2): 418-21; abstract available at https://academic.oup.com/jme/article-abstract/48/2/418/894598).

"Mexicali, with a population of 689 775 in 2010, is capital of the Mexican state of Baja California (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicali). The city of Mexicali is located in the Mexicali Valley on the US-Mexico border adjacent to its sister city Calexico, California, which is located in the adjacent Imperial Valley of California, south of the Salton Sea; a map of this area can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mexicali,+Baja+California,+Mexico. Mexicali is an important industrial, as well as agricultural, center. - Mod.ML
