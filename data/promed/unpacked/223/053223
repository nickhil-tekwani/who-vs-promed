Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a husband and wife.
Brown P, Cervenakova L, McShane L, Goldfarb LG, Bishop K, Bastian F,
Kirkpatrick J, Piccardo P, Ghetti B, Gajdusek DC
A 53-year-old man died of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) after a
1.5-year clinical course. Four and a half years later, his then 55-year-old
widow died from CJD after a 1-month illness. Both patients had typical
clinical and neuropathologic features of the disease, and pathognomonic
proteinase-resistant amyloid protein ("prion" protein, or PrP) was present
in both brains. Neither patient had a family history of neurologic disease,
and molecular genetic analysis of their PrP genes was normal. No medical,
surgical, or dietary antecedent of CJD was identified; therefore, we are
left with the unanswerable alternatives of human-to-human transmission or
the chance occurrence of sporadic CJD in a husband and wife.

Let's see: 1-2 cases per million per year occurrence. Two cases within 5
years. This amounts to an expected probability of 1:10 D, or 1:9 D if only
over age 50 people are considered. Particularly amazing when viewed as a
conditional basis (given the first case occurred).
You won't find stronger proof of a common cause anywhere in science. Either
they were both exposed to a common agent, they both came from a
super-susceptible, inbred gene pool, or there is some means of human-human
transmission (e.g., sperm, blood, milk).
It certainly WASN'T an accidental coincidence of two "sporadic" cases.
Improbable events do not "just" occur: they have causes. This is the
"central dogma" of statistics.
