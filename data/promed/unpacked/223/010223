The Health Department has advised beachgoers not to expose open wounds to
saltwater or eat raw or undercooked shellfish. A rare [type of] bacteria
normally found on Gulf Coast beaches has shown up in Rhode Island waters in
Narragansett Bay. The bacteria, which can cause infections and nausea and
diarrhea in most people, [can be] life threatening to those with underlying
illnesses such as liver disease, AIDS, cancer, diabetes, and blood disorders.
The _Vibrio vulnificus_ bacterium has never been in Rhode Island waters
before, according to David R Gifford, director of the state Department of
Health. His department yesterday suggested that Rhode Islanders avoid
exposing open wounds to saltwater and avoid eating raw or undercooked
shellfish. (The shellfish advice is always in effect, Gifford said, because
of the potential dangers of eating raw shellfish.)
Of particular concern to the state are the warmer waters of the upper Bay,
from Greenwich Bay north to Providence, and inlets, shallow areas and
coastal ponds such as Ninigret Pond and the Great Salt Ponds.
Gifford said the bacteria need warm salt water to survive, but he would not
rule out the possibility of their presence in cooler parts of the Bay or in
the ocean. Nationally, there are about 100 cases of this infection a year,
1/3 of which are fatal, Gifford said.
In the last 5 years, Gifford said, there have been only 2 reported cases of
[infection by] the bacterium in Rhode Island. Both were in people who ate
shellfish in other states, Maryland and Connecticut, and then became ill
after they returned to Rhode Island.
The latest case is different. Gifford said a man in his 50s or 60s was
collecting shellfish near Warwick's Conimicut Point in Jul 2006. A wound on
his leg became infected, leading to a serious hospitalization. The man is
now recovering, Gifford said. He refused to release more information,
saying he did not want to jeopardize the man's privacy.
The state does not routinely test the water for this organism, since it is
normally found in warmer waters, Gifford said. But after learning of this
man's case, the waters and shellfish around Coniicut Point were tested. On
Thu night, 3 Aug 2006, the results came back showing low levels of the
bacteria. Gifford said the levels were high enough to issue the advisory
notice.
The department is now testing shellfish and water in the upper Bay and
other warm saltwater areas, including the inlets and coastal ponds. Results
could take a few weeks because of the complexity of [detecting] the
bacteria, Gifford said. The department was not sure how the bacterium got
to Rhode Island waters, but Gifford speculated that either the Gulf Stream
carried it up here or a ship in the Gulf carried it up here in water in its
ballast tank.

[_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative,
opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated
with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams,
and crabs), and finfish. It is found in all of the coastal waters of the
USA, usually in the warmer areas of the Gulf Coast. Cases of illness have
also been associated with brackish lakes in New Mexico and Oklahoma.
Environmental factors responsible for controlling members of _V.
vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH,
salinity, and increased dissolved organics.
Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea
water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral,
fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of
_V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The
"primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood
containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease,
particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged
skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream,
resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about
50 per cent). Over 70 per cent of infected individuals have distinctive
bulbous skin lesions (shown at
