Since 6 Mar 2016, 13 suspected cases of yellow fever have been reported in the Kongo-Central Province; 6 people have died.

Of the 13 reported cases, 10 have come from Angola, according to an information source in the Provincial Health Division of Kongo-Central Province. Last Saturday [12 Mar 2016], samples taken from the patients were sent to the National Institute for Biological Research (INRB) in Kinshasa for testing.

The same source within the Provincial Health Division said, without elaborating, that steps have been taken by the health authorities at the border with Angola to prevent the potential spread of a yellow fever epidemic.

On the side of civil society, some officials bemoan the lack of information about the disease since the 1st reports of suspected cases in the province.

[The number of suspected yellow fever (YF) cases has increased from 5 on 10 Mar 2016 to 13, and deaths from 2 to 6. If 10 of the current 13 cases of suspected YF came from Angola, presumably that means that 3 were locally acquired. It is critically important to confirm or rule out YF in these cases with laboratory testing as promptly as possible. If local transmission is occurring, swift response is needed to intensify surveillance with laboratory support and mount a vaccination campaign in the affected area.

Because the Angola-DRC border is likely to be leaky, it is probable that additional infected individuals may cross into the DRC. The coordination of health officials on both sides of the border will be helpful in restricting the flow of infected individuals across the border. - Mod.TY]

[Central Congo province is also known as Bas Congo (formerly Bas Zaire) and can be found on a map available at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/dr_congo_map.htm. It borders Angola on its south and west, the Republic of Congo on its north, Kinshasa to its northeast, and Bandundu to its east. - Mod.MPP
