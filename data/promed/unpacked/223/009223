Any person who spent 6 months or more in Britain between 1980 and 1996 will
be banned from donating blood in an effort to protect supplies from a fatal
brain disease linked to mad cow disease, New Zealand officials announced.
New Zealand's health ministry and blood service said a filtering process
would be put in place to identify any white blood cells associated with an
aggressive strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) before transfusion, a
move expected to cost the equivalent of $4 million each year.
The new strain of new variant CJD (nvCJD) has been linked to the British
outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease. The
spongiform diseases eat holes in the brains of victims, and no cure has
been discovered.
No New Zealander has ever contracted the disease, chief medical adviser
Colin Feek said. There is no evidence it can be transmitted by blood
transfusions or by any type of person-to-person contact, he said.
The European Union (EU) imposed a worldwide ban on British beef in 1996
when mad cow disease was linked to a similar fatal, brain-wasting disease
in humans. The EU lifted the ban in August, saying British beef was now safe.
Feek said there was no evidence people who visited Britain have become
infected - "even those who have eaten beef while traveling there."
"This is a case of erring very strongly on the side of caution, but we want
to assure recipients of the blood products that the blood supply continues
to be as safe as possible," Feek said.
The ban will come into effect from 17 Feb 2000. Feek said the policy was
not being implemented immediately as the blood service wants to ensure it
is "introduced consistently, effectively and without significant impact on
our ability to collect sufficient blood for patients."
