The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 10 Feb 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 819, of which 758 are confirmed and 61 are probable. In total, there were 516 deaths (455 confirmed and 61 probable) and 278 people cured.
- 170 suspected cases under investigation.
- 3 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Katwa, 1 in Komanda and 1 in Butembo.
- 3 new deaths from confirmed cases (all community deaths), including 1 in Katwa, 1 in Komanda and 1 in Butembo.
- 1 new recovery released from Butembo ETC

News of the response
Location in Bunia
-----------------
- The community death reported on Tue 12 Feb 2019 in Komanda [Ituri] is a woman resident in Katwa [North Kivu] who was the known contact of her husband who died of Ebola on 20 Jan 2019 in Katwa. She had refused follow-up contacts and vaccination. When she began to show signs of the disease, she fled with the help of her family to Bunia [Ituri] where she died. Her family in Butembo [North Kivu] decided to bring the body to Vuhovi [North Kivu] to bury her next to her husband. Having received the alert, Butembo's coordination of the response informed teams in the Ituri Provincial Division of Health to find the body and the family on the run. The security services intercepted the family at the Foner checkpoint in Komanda with the corpse who was disguised to appear that the young woman was still alive. The laboratory analyses of the samples taken from the corpse and the dignified and secure burial were carried out in Komanda. The family members escaped, but the provincial security services found them later.

- This case was classified in Komanda, where confirmation of the diagnosis of Ebola virus disease was made, in accordance with the convention adopted for this outbreak. Since this case went through Bunia during his illness, a mixed team of epidemiologists and vaccinators arrived in Bunia on Tue 12 Feb 2019 for in-depth investigations to trace his journey upon his arrival in Bunia, identify all his contacts, and vaccinate them.

Allegations of gender-based violence
------------------------------------
- The Guardian published on Tue 12 Feb 2019 an article entitled "Ebola vaccine offered in exchange for sex, Congo task force meeting told." The Ministry of Health contacted the Guardian asking them to correct the false allegations based on a misinterpretation of preliminary data from an assessment conducted by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The Department's response is available at https://tinyurl.com/yxk4c5vp.

- The Ministry of Health and its community engagement partners regularly conduct research and field surveys on various issues for the sole purpose of improving and adapting the response to the Ebola outbreak. These surveys are important tools for identifying and solving potential identified problems.

- In this case, IRC conducted an assessment in Beni on the impact of the Ebola outbreak and the response on women and girls. The results of this evaluation are still being analyzed, and a final report will be published once all the analyses are finalized. In focus group discussions, participants expressed concern that some services related to the Ebola response might be offered to women and girls in return for sexual favors given the social and security context in which they live. However, IRC clarified that during the discussions, no particular response service was mentioned by the participants. In addition, none of the focus group participants reported individual cases of sexual exploitation in exchange for any services related to the Ebola response.

- To date, the Ministry of Health has never received any complaints or reports of sexual exploitation by its staff as part of the Ebola response. Rumors about this had been circulating on social networks at one time and the Ministry of Health had been very clear that there would be no tolerance for this kind of behavior. Additional measures are being put in place to ensure a better system for detecting such incidents in the community.

- The exploitation of vulnerable groups in times of crisis is a real problem that must be taken into account in the design and adaptation of Ebola response strategies. These vulnerable groups are not just women and girls, but also include young boys, the elderly and people with disabilities. Together with our partners, we will continue to conduct community surveys to ensure the protection of all these vulnerable groups as part of the response to the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 78 000 people have been vaccinated.
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.

[To see the Guardian article referred to above, go to https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/12/ebola-vaccine-offered-in-exchange-for-sex-say-women-in-congo-drc.

It is important the MoH and the IRC look into the allegations made by the Guardian of women being exploited in exchange for the Ebola vaccine. The frequency of this abuse of power is exacerbated by women being unlikely to come forward with complaints personally at a meeting for fear of retribution and stigmatization. The frontline health care workers perpetrating these acts against women must be identified and punished accordingly. That is the only way it will stop. It must be taken seriously. As the MoH has stated, exploitation of vulnerable groups in times of crisis is a real problem. Therefore, one hopes it will be addressed with all haste.

Trina Helderman, senior health and nutrition adviser for Medair's global emergency response team, said the Ebola response should have established a higher standard of protection for women.

"This region of DRC has a long history of sexual violence and exploitation of women and girls. Though shocking, this is an issue that could have been anticipated," said Helderman. "Humanitarian actors should have been more prepared to put safety measures in place to prevent this from happening." (The Guardian) - Mod.LK]

[Buniaactualite.com, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://buniaactualite.com/bunia-un-cas-confirme-debola-enregistre-a-la-clinique-salama/

A confirmed case of Ebola haemorrhagic fever was recorded this Mon 11 Feb 2019 in the city of Bunia, capital of Ituri. The interim governor of the province, Pacific Keta, confirmed it to Buniaactualite.com, indicating that it is a woman who died at the Salama clinic and whose samples were not positive after laboratory analysis.

Emergency measures have been taken to prevent new contaminations, ensures the provincial authority.

This is the 1st ever confirmed case of this epidemic in Bunia city since the penetration of the virus in Ituri province in August last year [2018], killing more than 4 people including in Mambasa, Tchomia, and Komanda.

The risk of contamination in the capital of this province had increased since prevention teams along the border with neighboring North Kivu, epicenter of the contagion, have lowered their guard following the non-payment of their taxes.

[See the report regarding this case, which actually originated in Katwa, discussed in the MoH report above. It is unclear why the samples were not positive upon laboratory testing, as stated in this report, possibly because transmission was sexual(?), but the patient was confirmed to have died of Ebola according to the MOH. - Mod.LK]

[CIDRAP [Center for Infectious disease Research and Policy, abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/news-scan-feb-11-2019

Over the weekend and through today [11 Feb 2019] the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) health ministry reported 16 more lab-confirmed Ebola cases, 13 of them from Katwa, the outbreak's current hot spot. Also, in a 9 Feb 2019 update, health officials reported 7 more probable cases, all from Katwa involving people who became ill in November and December 2018 and died between November 2018 and January 2019.

Two of the latest lab-confirmed cases are from Butembo and one is from Vuhovi. The latest developments bring the overall outbreak total to 816 cases, which includes 755 confirmed and 61 probable infections. Outbreak responders are also investigating 178 suspected Ebola cases.

Eleven more people died from their infections. Seven occurred in the community, including 6 from Katwa and one from Vuhovi. Four people died in Ebola treatment centers, including 3 from Butembo and one from the Katwa facility. The latest deaths lift the outbreak's fatality total to 513.

In other outbreak developments, the ministry said in its 9 Feb 2019 update that immunization of primary care providers has started in Rwampara, a new health zone in Ituri province. It said it took the step because the health zone is located on a road used by thousands of people from Beni, and that vaccinating health workers is part of a plan to limit the spread of the virus to other provinces.

Event description
-----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. Since the last report on 4 Feb 2019 (Weekly Bulletin 5), 37 probable and confirmed EVD cases have been reported, with an additional 29 deaths.

As of 9 Feb 2019, a total of 811 EVD cases, including 750 confirmed and 61 probable cases have been reported. Seven retrospective probable cases (all died) were reported in Katwa health zone in the last week following a database update. To date, confirmed cases have been reported from 18 health zones: Beni (225), Biena (5), Butembo (61), Kalunguta (42), Katwa (196), Kayna (5), Kyondo (14), Mabalako (90), Manguredjipa (5), Masereka (8), Musienene (6), Mutwanga (4), Oicha (30), and Vuhovi (12) in North Kivu Province; and Komanda (27), Mandima (17), Nyankunde (1), and Tchomia (2) in Ituri Province. Thirteen of the 18 affected health zones reported at least one new confirmed case in the previous 21 days (20 Jan to 9 Feb 2019). Katwa, Butembo, and Beni health zones are the main hot spot areas, reporting 79% (89/112) of the new confirmed cases in the past 21 days.

A total of 510 deaths were recorded, including 449 among confirmed cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio among confirmed cases of 60% (449/750). 2 new healthcare workers were among the confirmed cases in the last week, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases among healthcare workers to 67 (8% of the total number of cases), with 21 deaths.

Contact tracing is ongoing in 16 health zones and remains challenging due to insecurity and continuing pockets of community reluctance. The number of contacts being followed as of 9 Feb 2019 was 7846, of whom 6625 (84%) had been seen in the previous 24 hours. The proportion of contacts followed in the previous 24 hours ranged from 55% (Vuhovi) to 100%.

[Highly recommended reading: In addition to the grave concerns over sexual abuse taken from the Guardian article cited above, the Daily Mail report contains a timeline of Ebola cases and deaths in the DRC and several excellent tables. It presents a figure demonstrating that "the rate of infection and death from Ebola has been rising since the outbreak began in August last year [2018]; it took more than 2 months (5 Aug-21 Oct 2018) for the 1st 200 cases to be confirmed, then 272 people were infected between 4 Nov and 25 Dec 2018."

A table shows "The history of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo since the killer virus was 1st discovered there in 1976," including year, cases, deaths, death %, strain, location. The case fatality rate ranges from 36% (Bundibugyo, Orientale, 2012) to 88% (Zaire, Yambuku, 1976). There is a single fatal Zaire case in Tandala in 1977 (100% CFR).

A final figure has data on which countries were struck down by Ebola during the 2014-16 epidemic. The range of case fatalities is from 28% in Sierra Leone to 67% in Guinea. The figures are from CDC. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 11 Feb 2019. Blood analysis
[Medical Press, abridged, edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-02-sophisticated-blood-analysis-clues-ebola.html

A detailed analysis of blood samples from Ebola patients in Sierra Leone is providing clues about the progression of the effects of the Ebola virus in patients and potential treatment pathways. A manuscript discussing the work, led by scientists at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory [PNNL], was published today [11 Feb 2019] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see citation below].

The findings point to a critical role for a molecular pathway that relies on the common nutrient choline, as well as the importance of cellular bodies known as microvesicles.

"There's a lot more research to be done; these are preliminary results based on a small number of samples," said PNNL scientist Jennifer Kyle, 1st author of the paper. "We do hope these results will someday benefit patients."

The results are based on the lipids, or fats, in the blood of people infected with Ebola, comparing the detailed lipid composition in patients who survived the illness to those who died and to people who were never infected. The study included blood samples from 11 patients who survived infection, 9 who died, and 10 healthy volunteers. The patient samples were from people in Sierra Leone who were infected with Ebola during an outbreak from 2014 to 2016, an event that caused more than 11 000 deaths in West Africa. The recent re-emergence of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo reinforces the need for approaches to manage this disease.

The team identified and quantified 423 separate molecular species of lipids, which are essential to everyday life. They serve as raw materials for our cell membranes -- structures that keep our body's cells intact -- and as signaling molecules and energy sources.

The team found major differences in "the lipidome" or collection of lipids between people who lived, who died, and who were never infected. Among the differences:

- Infected patients who survived had a much higher number of PC lipids (phosphatidylcholines or diacylglycerophosphocholines), and their levels increased with time as they successfully fought off the illness.
- Patients who died had higher levels of PS lipids (diacylglycerophosphoserines), which are known to spur cells to die. The Ebola virus relies on these molecules to replicate.

Significance
------------
Outbreaks of Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to emerge with severe and often deadly outcomes and global consequences. Novel strategies for examining host response differences that distinguish EVD survivors and fatalities can only deepen our understanding of the disease and expand diagnostic and treatment options. Lipids are major molecular constituents in human plasma with important structural, transport, energy, and signaling functions. Here we provide a comprehensive examination of the EVD lipidome. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we profiled the human plasma lipidome of patients that survived and succumbed to EVD during the 2014 outbreak in Sierra Leone. The results highlight the profound impact of EVD on the host lipidome, leading to possible therapies for improving EVD survival.

Abstract
--------
Ebola virus disease (EVD) often leads to severe and fatal outcomes in humans with early supportive care increasing the chances of survival. Profiling the human plasma lipidome provides insight into critical illness as well as diseased states, as lipids have essential roles as membrane structural components, signaling molecules, and energy sources. Here we show that the plasma lipidomes of EVD survivors and fatalities from Sierra Leone, infected during the 2014-2016 Ebola virus outbreak, were profoundly altered. Focusing on how lipids are associated in human plasma, while factoring in the state of critical illness, we found that lipidome changes were related to EVD outcome and could identify states of disease and recovery. Specific changes in the lipidome suggested contributions from extracellular vesicles, viremia, liver dysfunction, apoptosis, autophagy, and general critical illness, and we identified possible targets for therapies enhancing EVD survival.]

The 4 different drugs include 3 antibody treatments and one antiviral.

A clinical trial of patients taking place now in Congo is gathering evidence on experimental therapies to provide a proven option when the deadly virus inevitably emerges again.

The 1st multidrug clinical trial of Ebola therapies, which began enrolling patients in November 2018, will compare the effectiveness of 3 different antibody treatments and one antiviral drug. One therapy tested briefly during the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa, the largest ever, has already shown promise.

With the trial data, though, "We'll be able to say, ideally, that this drug or that drug actually does work, not just we think or hope it does work," says Richard Davey, one of the principal trial investigators and the deputy clinical director at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, MD.

The drug trial began at a treatment unit in the northeastern Congolese city of Beni, with plans to add additional units. Enrolled patients will receive 1 of the 4 trial therapies, as well as standard, supportive care including fluids, electrolytes and painkillers. Researchers will compare death rates between each group of enrolled patients after 28 days of treatment to determine each drug's effectiveness. All 4 treatments on trial have been studied in animals. The 3 antibody treatments have been deemed safe for human use, while safety testing of the antiviral in people is under way.

One [antibody treatment], called mAb114, was cloned from a sample taken from an Ebola survivor 11 years after the person's infection in 1995. This treatment targets a protein on the surface of the Ebola virus and somehow hampers the virus' entry into cells. All macaques given a lethal dose of Ebola and treated with mAb114 survived even when the drug was administered 5 days after infection, researchers reported in Science in 2016.

While mAb114 is comprised of a single antibody, 2 others -- REGN-EB3 and ZMapp -- are cocktails, each containing 3 different antibodies. In a study that evaluated different doses of REGN-EB3, certain dosing regimens prevented death in all or most macaques that had been infected with Ebola, according to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Meanwhile, ZMapp appeared to benefit some patients in a clinical trial conducted at the end of the outbreak in West Africa. Eight of 36 patients receiving the drug and supportive care died, compared with 13 of 35 patients who received only supportive care, researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016. But that earlier trial work didn't have enough patients to provide statistically significant evidence that the drug works better than supportive care alone.

The only non-antibody treatment being studied in the trial is an antiviral drug called remdesivir, or GS-5734, which appears to target a step in the virus' "owner's manual" for making copies of itself. The drug suppressed virus replication, and, in certain doses, helped Ebola-infected macaques survive, researchers reported in Nature in 2016.

All of the therapies under scrutiny are already being used in this outbreak under "compassionate use" protocols set by WHO. In the Congolese treatment units that will participate in the clinical trial, patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the drugs, with an equal number of patients in each group. If the trial doesn't enroll enough patients to get statistically significant results, it will remain open to patients in future outbreaks.

[Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), edited]
https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/msf-begins-enrolling-patients-clinical-trial-potential-ebola

Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) will participate in an ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 4 potential Ebola treatments in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, the international medical humanitarian organization said Tue [12 Feb 2019].

The trial, which began in November 2018 in another treatment center in the region, is taking place in MSF treatment centers in Katwa and Butembo, the current hotspots of the Ebola epidemic that was declared on 1 Aug 2018. It aims to identify the most effective of the 4 treatments being used in the trial: Remdesivir, mAb114, REGN-EB3, and ZMapp.

The 4 options have been offered to patients since the beginning of this epidemic under the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI) protocol. A trial could help generate the scientific data needed to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these treatments. The main objective of this trial is to identify the most effective of the 4 products.

The trial is overseen by a steering committee convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) and led by National Institute of Biomedical Research of DRC (INRB), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in collaboration with other national and international actors.

MSF's Butembo treatment center can admit 96 people, while the one in Katwa, which opened last month, has a 62-bed capacity. MSF has admitted more than 2100 patients to these 2 centers, of which 250 were confirmed cases, with 110 people recovered. The trial started in Butembo on 7 Feb 2019 and is expected to start in Katwa in the coming days.

"Collaboration is key to the Ebola strategy," said Dr Michel Yao, Emergency Operations Manager for WHO / Africa and Ebola response coordinator in North Kivu and in Ituri on Tue 12 Feb 2019. According to him, the Ebola response strategy is good and adapted. He calls for a general mobilization to "not reach extreme situations."

"To overcome this disease, it is imperative that the people work together. There are positive Ebola cases in Butembo for which we have not yet been able to vaccinate for more than a week," said Dr. Michel Yao.
