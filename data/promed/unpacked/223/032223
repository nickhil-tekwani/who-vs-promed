Viet Nam is among 9 countries in the Western Pacific region that face a serious threat of viral hepatitis B, the health ministry said yesterday, 6 May 2015. It said this was evident from the infection rate of 10 to 20 percent of the total population of Viet Nam.

The ministry's preventive health department said the WHO listed Viet Nam among countries that had alarming numbers of infected patients. The other 8 countries are Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, and Papua New Guinea, as well as the Philippines, the Solomon Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu.

Viral hepatitis is the top cause of liver cancer or cirrhosis of the liver. About 25 percent of the patients who suffer from viral hepatitis will develop liver cancer if they are not treated. Vaccination is considered the most effective method to prevent it.

Figures from the WHO show that the hepatitis B virus is responsible for about 1 million deaths annually.

[The seroprevalence rate of active, almost all chronic, hepatitis B in one area of Viet Nam was recently also reported in
Do SH, Yamada H, Fujimoto M, et al: High prevalences of hepatitis B and C virus infections among adults living in Binh Thuan province, Vietnam. Hepatol Res. 2015; 45(3): 259-68. The abstract (edited) is reproduced below.

"Abstract
--------
Viet Nam is one of the countries with the highest mortality from liver cancer, which is mostly attributed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. For planning preventive strategies against these infections, we investigated prevalences of HBV and HCV infections among adults living in Binh Thuan, Viet Nam.

Our study consisted of a serological survey for HBV and HCV infections and a questionnaire survey on their risk factors. The sample size was calculated based on anticipated rate of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). Subjects were randomly sampled using a multistage method. Confirmation and family-tree surveys were conducted to examine persistent HBV infection and intrafamilial HBV transmission, respectively.

A total of 509 adults, comprised of 230 men (45.2 percent) and 279 women (54.8 percent), were enrolled. Prevalences of HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody were 15.3 percent, 60.3 percent, and 71.7 percent, respectively. Most HBV DNA positive sera were classified as genotype B (75.3 percent) and C (11.7 percent). Of HBsAg positive subjects, 96.7 percent were persistently infected and 1 acutely HBV infected person was identified. Family-tree surveys suggested that horizontal extrafamilial HBV transmission might have been frequent. Prevalences of anti-HCV and HCV RNA were 3.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively. HCV genotype 6a was prominent (55.6 percent).

In Binh Thuan, prevalences of HBV and HCV infections are high, HBV genotype B and HCV genotype 6a are predominant, and horizontal HBV transmission may still occur. Therefore, raising the coverage of a universal HBV vaccination program may be an effective liver cancer control in Vietnam."

A vaccine to prevent hepatitis B was first available in the spring of 1982, more than 40 years ago. It seems clear that a universal HBV vaccination program is not in use in Viet Nam or in the other countries mentioned in the post, as such seroprevalence rates were probably about the same for decades. Such programs, used perinatally, will decrease the acquisition rate of HBV infection, vertically or horizontally, leading to a substantially lower chronic carrier rate of HBV and parallel substantially lower amount of HBV-associated cirrhosis and liver cancer. The HBV vaccine is the 1st cancer vaccine available to humans. - Mod.LL
