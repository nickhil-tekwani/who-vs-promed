Portrait emerges of anthrax suspect's troubled life
---------------------------------------------------
Nearly 7 years and many millions of dollars later, after an
investigation that included both path-breaking science and costly
bungling, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] concluded that ...
the anthrax killer had been at the investigators' side all along.
Prosecutors said they believed they had the evidence to prove that Dr
Ivins alone carried out the attacks, but their assertions immediately
met with skepticism among some scientists, lawmakers and co-workers of
Dr Ivins.

With the FBI preparing to close the case, The New York Times has
taken the deepest look so far at the investigation, speaking to
dozens of Dr Ivins's colleagues and friends, reading hundreds of his
e-mail messages, interviewing former bureau investigators and anthrax
experts, reviewing court records, and obtaining, for the 1st time,
police reports on his suicide in July [2008], including a lengthy
recorded interview with his wife.

That examination found that unless new evidence were to surface, the
enormous public investment in the case would appear to have yielded
nothing more persuasive than a strong hunch, based on a pattern of
damning circumstances, that Dr Ivins was the perpetrator.

Focused for years on the wrong man, the bureau missed ample clues
that Dr Ivins deserved a closer look. Only after a change of
leadership nearly 5 years after the attacks did the bureau more fully
look into Dr Ivins's activities. That delay, and his death, may have
put a more definitive outcome out of reach.

[The above are but 4 paragraphs from a long and insightful article by
Scott Shane. Members are encouraged to read it in full. It paints a
picture of a very disturbed man.

The hard evidence is still limited to a flask of _Bacillus anthracis_
spores in his laboratory which, sensu strictu, uniquely matched the
forensic genomic profile of the contents of the various 2001 letters,
which were cultured somewhere in the Frederick, Maryland, water table
area. The rest, unfortunately, is legal window dressing.

The unusually high silicon content embedded within the letter spore
coat has not been resolved, and the Provo laboratory was reportedly
unable to replicate it. Thus it is not normal variation. If Ivins was
capable of routinely producing large quantities of wet spores at a
high concentration for research, which it appears he was (see p. 6),
there should be residues of such production, which could be checked
for characteristics in common with the letter products. If he was
responsible for the letters, it would be unlikely that he would have
used a novel technique rather than a tried and true one.

Either way it is a sad business. - Mod.MHJ]
