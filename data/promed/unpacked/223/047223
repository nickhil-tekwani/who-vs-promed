An epidemic of animal tuberculosis has hit the countryside surrounding
Niamey, Niger One slaughterhouse just outside the capital city provided
statistics showing that 4/5s of the livestock in the Torodi area south of
Niamey had contracted the disease.
According to the wire report, there is an underground black market in freshly
slaughtered meat, bypassing regulated slaughterhouses inside the capital.
