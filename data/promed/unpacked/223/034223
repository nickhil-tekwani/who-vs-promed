ProMED-mail is a program of the
International Society for Infectious Diseases

[Note: as SARS activity has been decreasing, many of the official
websites are not posting updates on the weekends (Saturday and
Sunday). ProMED-mail will continue to monitor official websites and
post material as it becomes available. ProMED-mail will also monitor
newswire reports, but will continue to exercise prudence in posting
from newswires, as many "suspected" cases reported through newswires
are later found to have other etiologies. - Mod. MPP]
