The Minister of Health, Population and Hospital Reform, Abdelmalek Boudiaf, sent an inquiry committee to Cheria [district] public health institution in Tebessa to investigate the outbreak that has emerged in this province.

This came after the Pasteur Institute confirmed that the deaths of 4 people in Tebessa province on [Wed 16 Dec 2015] and [Thu 17 Dec 2015] were not due to seasonal influenza virus as it was reported by the institute earlier. Therefore, Boudiaf changed his position and sent an inquiry committee to investigate these deaths. Meanwhile the hypothesis of coronavirus as the most potential cause of the death of these people has reemerged.

It is worth mentioning that the head of the People's Assembly and members of the health committee belonging to this assembly have visited Cheria hospital to check the capacity of the hospital and its ability to receive more cases.

Several claims were raised by the relatives of the patients and city residents who did not accept the 1st diagnoses provided by the Pasteur Institute that mentioned seasonal flu.

[It seems more likely that these cases are not seasonal influenza, as the Pasteur Institute has now confirmed. MERS-CoV is certainly a possible cause of the outbreak. ProMED-mail looks forward to further information on etiology. See below for an additional case and comments. - Mod.LK]

A new case of death from seasonal influenza has been recorded today [20 Dec 2015] in Constantine Hospital. This is the 6th case of death from this outbreak in Algeria. According to our sources, an elderly person from Tebessa province has died after developing symptoms similar to those of the other 5 patients who died.

[The reports above confirm the occurrence of 6 deaths since Wed 16 Dec 2015 in Tebessa province, Algeria as a result of a disease that initially was claimed to be seasonal influenza. Seasonal influenza can result in hospitalization and death, but mainly among high-risk groups like the very young, elderly, or chronically ill.

As the Pasteur Institute has refuted earlier reports attributing these deaths to seasonal influenza, speculations have arisen, and these deaths have been linked to other diseases such as avian influenza or MERS-CoV. Occurrence of 6 deaths within a few days and involving young people goes more with infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 virus rather than seasonal influenza. However, no sources of bird infection or contact with infected bird products have been reported from Algeria.

These speculations and the state of high alert among people have led the Ministry of Health to establish an inquiry committee to investigate this outbreak.

Any additional information from knowledgeable sources about this outbreak would be highly appreciated. - Mod.NS

Thanks for providing the possibility to add the following comment:
In reference to the mentioning of avian influenza and MERS as candidate aetiologies for the described human (respiratory) cases:

1. Algeria indicated in the most recent annual report to the OIE (covering the year 2014, submitted in 2015) that highly pathogenic avian influenza is included among the diseases which have never been recorded in Algeria. The measures applied in relation to this disease are "General and targeted surveillance". The disease is reportable in Algeria.

2. MERS-CoV is not included in OIE's list of (reportable) animal diseases, but is expected to be reported as an emerging not-listed disease, if infection (for example, in camels) is diagnosed. 2 human cases were diagnosed in Algeria in June 2014, both suspected to have been infected while on pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia (see item 4 in MERS-CoV (01): Bangladesh, KSA, Algeria, UAE, Iran, WHO, RFI 20140616.2541707.) To the best of our knowledge, this disease has never been diagnosed in Algeria in animals, including camels. - Mod.AS
