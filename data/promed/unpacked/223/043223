Chivi livestock placed on indefinite quarantine
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Veterinary Services in Masvingo has imposed an indefinite
quarantine on the movement of livestock to and from Chivi, fearing the
spread of anthrax, which has claimed over 80 cattle and goats up to now.
The move to quarantine livestock in Chivi follows an increase in the number
of animals that are succumbing to the disease in the district since the 1st
outbreak was reported in November last year [2004].
Anthrax also claimed 3 people, after they had consumed meat from infected
cattle.
The acting provincial veterinary officer, Dr. Charity Sibanda, yesterday
[25 Jan 2005] said the quarantine of livestock in Chivi would remain in
place until further notice. "No person shall move any infectious thing from
Chivi district or otherwise in accordance with the conditions of a permit
issued by veterinary services, and no person is allowed to let his
livestock stray into or from Chivi district.
"We have decided to impose a quarantine in Chivi, because the situation has
now gone out of hand, as more livestock and humans continue to suffer from
the disease," said Dr. Sibanda. She said though anthrax had killed over 180
cattle and goats in Gutu and Zaka, the veterinary department believed Chivi
had more livestock deaths that went unreported and that more people have
continued to suffer from the disease there.
By last week [3rd week of January 2005], there were 31 reported cases of
anthrax in humans in Gutu, while Chivi had 96 reported cases, a number
which continued to increase. Dr. Sibanda said they had vaccinated over 40
000 cattle in Chivi district against anthrax but stressed that 30 000 more
anthrax doses were needed to vaccinate cattle in the whole district.
"We do not have sufficient doses to complete the vaccination of cattle
against anthrax in Chivi district, and we would be happy if we received
more vaccine doses," she said. She added that it was important for people
to realize that an animal that has died of anthrax would be infected on
every part, and it was, therefore, not safe for consumption.
Efforts to fight the anthrax outbreak have been affected by an acute
shortage of vaccines that are imported from countries such as South Africa
and Botswana. Officials at the veterinary department have said that they
were not getting sufficient allocations of foreign currency to import
anthrax vaccines. Last year [2004], the disease wreaked havoc in Bikita
district, where it killed hundreds of cattle in the Ngorima and Mutikizizi
areas.
The death of livestock in Masvingo, especially cattle, has seriously dented
efforts by the province to rebuild its cattle herd that was almost halved
during the severe drought experienced in 1992.

[If something is not done soon to protect the other livestock in this
region, much less district, we can expect this outbreak to progress
unchecked and increasingly impact the rest of the country. In 1978-80,
Southern Rhodesia/Zimbabwe suffered 10 000 human cases and untold livestock
deaths. We may be seeing the onset of a 2nd such epidemic. - Mod.MHJ]
