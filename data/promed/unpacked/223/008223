As the dry season begins, we expect an increase in the number of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) cases in Nigeria. This is the 1st SitRep [situation report] for the 2018/2019 seasons.

The National Technical Working Group for Cerebrospinal Meningitis has been improving [the] level of preparedness ahead of the 2018/2019 meningitis season. States in the meningitis belt were formally placed on alert on [8 Nov 2018].

As at epi-week 50, 8 new suspected cases were reported from Katsina state.

Beginning from 1 Oct 2018 to 18 Dec 2018, a total of 72 suspected cases have been reported from 10 states. Four samples were positive for bacterial meningitis. _Neisseria meningitides_ serogroup C (NmC) accounted for 100% (4) of the positive cases.

Key indicators:
Total [suspected] cases reported: 72
Total deaths: 9
Confirmed cases: 4
States that have reported at least one suspected case: 10
LGAs [local government areas] in alert in the last 4 weeks ([epi-]week 47-50, 2018): 1
LGAs in epidemic in the last 4 weeks ([epi-]week 47-50, 2018): 0
Cumulative LGAs ever in epidemic: 0

[Northern Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C, and, in some cases, other bacterial species.

Seven (Sokoto, Zamfara, Katsina, Kano, Jigawa, Yobe, and Bauchi) of the 10 states reporting suspected cases in 2018 are located in northern Nigeria, most along its northern border with Niger, and 3 states (Ebonyi, Bayelsa, and Ondo) are located in southern Nigeria. Katsina recorded most of the suspected cases (29) and deaths (5). With a total of 9 deaths, the case fatality rate (CFR) is 12.5% among all suspected cases.
