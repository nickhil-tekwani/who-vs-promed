The death toll from a meningitis epidemic in Burkina Faso rose to 324
on Fri 2 Mar 2007, and the UN says outbreaks and deaths have also
been recorded in 7 other West African countries in 2007.
Burkina Faso is by far the hardest hit country in the region, with
almost 1000 additional people infected in the last week bringing the
total number of recorded cases to 3625, according government health
authorities. Outbreaks have been recorded in 5 out of 53 health
districts, with 14 other districts on alert.
Elsewhere in the region the worst hit country is Cote d'Ivoire with
100 cases and 28 deaths followed by, 84 cases and 14 deaths in Niger,
73 cases and 6 deaths in Mali and 68 cases and 16 deaths in Benin,
according to figures provided by the UN humanitarian coordination
agency (OCHA). Other cases have been reported in Ghana, Togo and
Guinea.
According to OCHA and the Burkina Faso government, the number of
vaccines in the region is insufficient to stop the epidemic from
spreading. Last week the Canadian embassy in Ouagadougou announced it
would provide Burkina Faso with US $188 000 worth of vaccines but the
country's health minister Alain Yoda said that a comprehensive
preventive vaccination campaign would require [US] $1.6 million.
West Africa's semi-arid Sahelian countries, sometimes referred to as
the "meningitis belt", are hit each year by outbreaks of bacterial
meningitis during the dry seasons between December and June.
Dust-laden winds along with cold nights combine to lower people's
immunity to respiratory tract infections.
The countries in the region are among the poorest in the world and
vaccinations are usually administered only after an outbreak has
occurred.
