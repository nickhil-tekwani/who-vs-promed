Opposition activists have posted a video of what they say is chlorine gas floating through the streets of a Syrian village, and they accuse President Bashar al-Assad of mounting a chemical weapons campaign. Activists and medical sources said the village of Kfar Zeita, in the central province of Hama 125 miles north of Damascus, has been the focus of a 2 month assault, in which chlorine gas canisters have been dropped out of helicopters. The government denies its forces have used chlorine or deadlier poisonous gases and blames all chemical attacks on rebels waging a 3 year uprising against Assad.

The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has opened an investigation into the alleged chlorine attacks, more than a dozen of which have been reported since 11 Apr 2014 in several areas. "Inspectors for the fact-finding mission arrived in Syria last week and are trying to get to some of the sites," the OPCW said.

Text accompanying the opposition video, posted by a user called Mustapha Jamaa, said it was filmed on Thursday (22 May 2014) in Kfar Zeita by the Revolution General Commission opposition group. It showed green-yellow gas in a street. A man runs away from the gas cloud with a woman who is holding a cloth to her mouth. Another man in camouflage trousers and wearing a gas mask calls out for a car to assist the woman. A voice off screen says: "Chlorine gas bombing. Yellow smoke."

Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage. The video did not show an impact site or indicate where it was filmed. A freelance photographer told Reuters he arrived at the scene of the attack an hour after a helicopter dropped the bomb. "The smell of chlorine was very obvious. It smelt like vinegar, or bleach. I started to cough and hyperventilate. My eyes were burning," he said. One of his photos showed the woman who was running away from the gas in the video. She was being treated with oxygen at a field hospital. "There were 70 wounded people," he said. "Those who were at the impact site fainted."

Activists said Kfar Zeita was attacked twice on Thursday [22 May 2014], as well as the village of Al-Tamana'a in north west Idlib province. The alleged attack took place on the same day that Russia and China vetoed a resolution to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court for possible prosecution of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Assad agreed with the United States and Russia to dispose of his chemical weapons after hundreds of people were killed in a sarin gas attack on the outskirts of the capital last August [2013].

Chlorine is likely to be lethal than sarin but its use as a weapon is still illegal under a global chemical weapons convention that Syria signed. Its use would also breach the terms of the deal with Washington and Moscow, itself now weeks behind schedule, with roughly 7 per cent of Assad's chemical arsenal still inside Syria.

A diplomat in the region said that 15 OPCW inspectors were stuck in Damascus while they negotiate access with the government and rebels. "They are negotiating security guarantees from all sides. That's a challenge with opposition groups," he said. Syria did not declare chlorine as part of its stockpile, further complicating the operation to rid Assad of chemical weapons.

Syria's civil war started with a pro-democracy movement against Assad that armed itself following attacks by security forces on protesters. The ensuing conflict has killed more than 160 000 people, a third of them civilians, and caused millions to flee.

[This article offers limited information about the situation, and we hope a thorough investigation will provide clarification.

Chlorine is an element used in industry and found in some household products. It is sometimes in the form of a poisonous gas. Chlorine gas can be pressurized and cooled to change it into a liquid so that it can be shipped and stored. When liquid chlorine is released, it quickly turns into a gas that stays close to the ground and spreads rapidly.

Chlorine gas can be recognized by its pungent, irritating odor, which is like the odor of bleach. The strong smell may provide adequate warning to people that they are exposed. Chlorine gas appears yellow-green in color.

Chlorine itself is not flammable, but it can react explosively or form explosive compounds with other chemicals such as turpentine and ammonia. If chlorine gas is released into the air, people may be exposed through skin contact or eye contact. They also may be exposed by breathing air that contains chlorine. When chlorine gas comes into contact with moist tissues such as the eyes, throat, and lungs, an acid is produced that can damage these tissues.

During or immediately after exposure to dangerous concentrations of chlorine, the following signs and symptoms may develop:
- blurred vision,
- burning pain, redness, and blisters on the skin if exposed to gas. Skin injuries similar to frostbite can occur if it is exposed to liquid chlorine,
- burning sensation in the nose, throat, and eyes,
- coughing,
- chest tightness,
- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. These may appear immediately if high concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled, or they may be delayed if low concentrations of chlorine gas are inhaled,
- fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) that may be delayed for a few hours,
- nausea and vomiting,
- watery eyes,
- wheezing.

Showing these signs or symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to chlorine.

No antidote exists for chlorine exposure. Treatment consists of removing the chlorine from the body as soon as possible (shower, bathe, change clothes) and providing supportive medical care such as inhaled breathing treatments for wheezing in a hospital setting.
