Three patients who took shelter after the 2015 mega-earthquake (on 25 Apr 2015) visited our hospital with a history of fever, headache, lethargy and vesicular rash appearing on the face, trunk, chest and whole body. All patients spent at least 3 days in separate shelters together with other people.

1st case: A 17-year-old male, history of contact with his younger brother who had been diagnosed with chickenpox. He is currently in a shelter together with another approximately 19 people (including children). He is being treated on an outpatient basis in our hospital.

2nd case: A 6-year-old girl, no history of contact with chickenpox suspected/confirmed cases in the shelter. She was diagnosed with chickenpox based on clinical signs and symptoms. She is currently being treated on an outpatient basis in our hospital.

3rd case: A 26-year-old male visited the emergency department of our hospital a week ago where he was diagnosed with chickenpox. He was treated with the antiviral drug (acyclovir) and is now almost recovered from his illness.

Some medical doctors who have visited other shelters also found additional chickenpox cases in Kathmandu, indicating that chickenpox could potentially spread among people, especially to those who had not had been previously infected or immunized, because the virus is highly contagious and spreads quickly and easily through the respiratory route.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pun for this firsthand report.

The incubation period of varicella is 14-21 days, averaging about 17 days, so these individuals were exposed prior to the earthquake.

In a 1991 report on sero-epidemiology in Nepal (Kubo T, Rai SK, Nakanishi M, Yamano T: Seroepidemiological study of herpes viruses in Nepal. Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 1991;22:323-325), only 25 percent of children 1-4 years old showed antibodies to VZV, but the number of positives increased rapidly with age (82.9 percent in greater than 15 years age). This would suggest that most Nepali adolescents and adults (a cohort with higher risk of more severe illness from varicella) are likely to be immune, but overcrowding in shelters would enhance the likelihood of increased cases. - Mod.LL
