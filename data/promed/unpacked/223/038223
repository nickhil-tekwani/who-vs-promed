INFECTION CONTROL - CANADA (3)
==============================
Date: Fri, 28 Jun 1996 08:04:48 EST5EDT
From: "Shirley McDonald" <MCDONALD@ic.path.queensu.ca>

There are 3 Infection Control Practitioners at Kingston General
Hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada who follow ProMED-mail and other
Internet resources as an addional communication tool. Maybe it's
time to create an Infection Control Homepage!
[Send e-mail to: Kathy Wittman RN, CIC, Kaweah Delta Health Care District,
California, USA, kwittman@kdhcd.org to join the list - Mod.JW]
MRSA: We have been noticing an increase in MRSA numbers since March of this
year, which seems to coincide with what is being seen in other
hospitals in southern Ontario.
VRE: We also survey for VRE (no cases yet)
but do not routinely screen stool, although we did participate in a
one-month study this year in which VRE screening was done on ICU,
NICU, and Oncology patients and no VRE was found.
