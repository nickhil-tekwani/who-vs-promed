Alabama detects watermelon disease, yellow vine decline
-------------------------------------------------------
It appears we may have identified a new disease of watermelons and other
cucurbits in Alabama. On [8 Jun 2010] we collected samples from plants
expressing symptoms of "cucurbit yellow vine decline" (CYVD) from a small
commercial watermelon field in east-central Alabama.

This would be the 1st report of the disease in the state. We are trying to
confirm our diagnosis with the help of USDA [US Department of Agriculture]
scientists. The disease has been observed on squash and pumpkins, as well
as melons in the US.

Symptoms caused by CYVD are very similar to those of bacterial wilt, which
is a disease transmitted by cucumber beetles, but the progression is much
slower than CYVD, in which the plants rapidly turn yellow and wilt almost
overnight. Control of CYVD relies on managing the squash bug vectors early
in the season.

Fusarium wilt hits Georgia watermelons
--------------------------------------
Georgia [watermelon] farmers now grow seedless varieties. The switch has
them fighting a deadly plant disease that likes seedless melons as much as
consumers do, says David Langston, University of Georgia. Fusarium wilt
[FW] is now popping up frequently in Georgia watermelon fields.

"It will infect the roots and basically kills the plant," he says. Damage
so far this year [2010] has been localized, but as much as half of some
fields has been lost to it. "We've seen a considerable increase in FW this
year so far, twice as much as previous years," Langston says. Every
watermelon-growing county in Georgia has had reports of FW in seedless melons.

The industry has developed varieties with FW resistance, but all of them
have seeds. Seedless watermelons have become the most widely grown type in
Georgia and other states like Florida and Texas, where farmers are also
seeing increased problems with FW. It can build up in fields that are
planted with watermelons each year, killing even more plants the following
year.

Most important is finding resistant varieties. "Seedless melons have no
resistance at all and [private breeders] have a very difficult time
breeding FW resistance into them," Langston says. FW is just another
disease back on farmers' radars. But it will need to be defeated soon, or
many farmers could be planting themselves into an unavoidable corner in the
coming years.

[Cucurbit yellow vine decline (CYVD)
------------------------------------
CYVD is caused by the bacterium _Serratia marcescens_. Severely reduced
yields have been reported in a range of cucurbits such as pumpkin, melons,
and squash, but cucumbers do not appear to be affected. Symptoms include
yellowing and wilting of leaves and vines, discolouration of phloem in
lower crown and primary roots, failure to produce fruit, and plants may
collapse and die.

CYVD is transmitted by squash bugs (insects of family _Coreidae_ with
_Anasa tristis_ a common species in North America). Squash bugs overwinter
as adults and the bacterium survives within the vector which spreads it to
the new season's crop. Disease management relies on vector control by crop
rotation, biological, and chemical means. Some genetic resistance in
triploid seedless watermelon has been identified.

_S. marcescens_ is a cosmopolitan microbe with different strains living in
a range of environments including water and soil. Some strains are
non-pathogenic saprophytes while others may affect vertebrates (including
humans) or insects. In plants, some strains are growth promoting
rhizobacteria or potential agricultural biocontrol agents with anti-fungal
properties. The strains involved in CYVD have been shown to differ
significantly from strains isolated from other ecological niches.

Fusarium wilt (FW)
------------------
FW on watermelon is caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp.
_niveum_ and can cause serious crop losses. Symptoms include discolouration
of vascular bundles and wilting of the plant. Plants may be affected at any
growth stage: young seedlings are killed or severely stunted, while older
plants wilt at midday for a few days, then permanently wilt and die.
Disease development is favoured by high soil temperatures.

The fungus can persist in the soil for many years. Spread occurs mainly
with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water, and human activities
(for example on contaminated farm machinery). Disease management needs an
integrated approach including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures to
avoid spread to new fields. The usefulness of resistant cultivars, if
available, may depend also on fungal populations in the soil. Flooding of
fields has been reported to reduce pathogen survival in the soil.

_F. o._ f. sp. _cucumerinum_ affects cucumber, and f. sp. _melonis_ affects
rockmelon and muskmelon. Each pathogen is highly specialised attacking only
a single crop species.
