The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) is warning consumers not to eat certain 7th Heaven Gourmet spreads because they may have been improperly produced, making them susceptible to contamination with _Clostridium botulinum_. Ingestion of botulism toxin from improperly processed jarred and canned foods may lead to serious illness and death. No illnesses have been linked to any of the affected products at this time.

7th Heaven Gourmet of Hesperia, California, is voluntarily recalling the following varieties of spreads: Pate Mediterraneo and Eggplant & Shitake Tapenade. These products were sold under the 7th Heaven Gourmet label and packaged in 8 ounce, glass jars with screw-on metal lids. These food products lack production or date codes.

7th Heaven Gourmet jarred spreads were available for purchase between September 2011 and July 2012, and sold at the following Farmer's Markets:
-Victorville Farmers Market (Victor Valley College) 18422 Bear Valley Rd, Victorville, CA
-Victoria Garden Farmers Market, 12505 North Mainstreet, Rancho Cucamonga, CA
-Palm Springs Village Fest, North Palm Canyon between Amato and Ramon, Palm Springs, CA
-The Inland Certified Farmers Market, 5261 Arlington Ave., Riverside CA

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C. botulinum_. - Mod.LL
