A product considered to be an alternative to caviar has been linked to a botulism outbreak in Denmark. The incident occurred after 6 people ate together at a company in early March 2021 in Southern Denmark. A total of 3 were hospitalized because of botulism and 2 other people reported mild symptoms.

Agustson A/S, the producer, has recalled red fish roe because of a risk that some pots from the batch could contain toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. The Statens Serum Institut (SSI) examined a number of food leftovers that Fodevarestyrelsen (the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration) collected. In an opened glass of roe that was almost empty, SSI's laboratory tests were able to detect the toxins. However, there were no other positives in any of the other foods or in 2 other jars of the roe.

Patients were treated with botulism antitoxin and the condition of all of them is improving. Analysis of stool from one patient shows it is toxin type B.

The recalled "Nora Seafood Rod stenbiderrogn" in 60-gram jars was produced on [23 Apr 2020]. It has a best before date of [23 Oct 2021], and the lot number L0114. It was sold at Netto stores throughout the country.

Consumers who have bought this batch were advised to throw it out or take it back to the store where it was purchased. Nikolas Kuhn Hove, from Fodevarestyrelsen, said botulinum toxin is not suspected in other batches from the same supplier.

"We have no reason to suspect an issue by the consumer, nor in the supply chain or at the production. The specific batch has been sold back in July, September and December 2020 and we have no reports of other cases of illness or other faults on the lot. Fortunately, we have only seen one company with botulism illness. This can show that we, so far, only have this one glass of red roe, where _Clostridium botulinum_ has had the possibility to grow and develop toxin," he said.
