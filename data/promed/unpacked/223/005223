The National Ministry of Health says that an 8 year old girl has died of a hantavirus [infection] in Chubut province. The child presented with severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Due to her clinical picture, she was moved in order to consult with a local healthcare center on 8 Jul [2022]. This Tuesday [12 Jul 2022] she was admitted to the Zone Hospital in Esquel, where she deteriorated and died on Wednesday morning [13 Jul 2022].

After this case, the health agency reported that it will investigate who were the close contacts she had in order to carry out a series of control measures.

Including this girl, 32 cases of hantavirus [infection] have been confirmed in Argentina so far this year [2022]. This figure comes from the provinces of Buenos Aires, the City of Buenos Aires, Chubut, Entre Ríos, Jujuy, Salta, and Tucumán; 5 people have died.

[There is no indication of the environmental setting where this unfortunate young girl might have acquired her infection. The health agency's investigation may determine that and, one hopes, inform the public in that locality about preventive measures for avoiding infection. Although the virus involved in the above case and the previous one is not mentioned, the most likely virus involved is Andes virus, found in western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. There is also the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, which is widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_). Andes virus can also be transmitted directly between people in close physical contact, but there is no indication that this was the route of transmission in the above case. - Mod.TY
