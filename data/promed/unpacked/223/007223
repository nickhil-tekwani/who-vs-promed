[Again, this virus turns out to be a serotype A FMD virus. However, the
distance from the previous outbreaks in China is very great as farms are at
opposite ends of the country. In fact this outbreak in Beijing province is
closer to the outbreak in South Korea. As always, comparative analysis of
genotypes in a given geographical areas, irrespective of borders, will give
us the best insight into the epidemiology of an FMD outbreak at any
particular time.
