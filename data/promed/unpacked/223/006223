[West Nile virus surveillance reports are up-dated to 13 Oct 2000. The
number of human cases remains at 17 with one death. The volume of positive
reports is beginning to decline with onset of colder weather as expected,
and there has been no further outward spread of the virus. Please note that
the USDA report includes confirmed findings only up to 7 Oct 2000, but now
includes a useful map of the positive findings which among other things
illustrates how state boundaries are affecting efficiency of surveillance

On 13 Oct 2000, the State of Connecticut confirmed a horse testing positive
for West Nile Virus (WNV) in Newtown. This is the sixth horse testing
positive for WNV in Connecticut this year. The owner reported the onset of
clinical signs on 19 Sep 2000. The horse was euthanized on 21 Sep 2000 and
a serum sample was collected that day. The horse had an extensive travel
history inside and outside the state. The United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Veterinary Services in conjunction with the Connecticut
Department of Agriculture (DoAg) will conduct blood sample surveys around
the positive horse to assess WNV activity in the area.
The State also announced an additional crow has tested positive for Eastern
Equine Encephalitis (EEE). The bird, collected on 25 Sep 2000 in Milford
does not pose a human health risk to the public, but does indicate the
presence of EEE activity in the area. This crow brings the total number of
birds testing positive for EEE in Connecticut this year to 6, one wild
turkey and 5 crows.

Human Testing
In total, blood and/or spinal fluid samples from 46 residents have been or
are in the process of being tested for the presence of West Nile virus
(WNV). To date, 4 tests were positive, 27 were negative and 15 are pending.
These individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV
testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties
where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered. New
Jersey's positive human cases include an 82-year old Little Falls man who
became ill 3 Sep 2000, was admitted to a hospital 3 days later, and died 14
Sep 2000. New Jersey's other human cases include a 43-year old Jersey City
man, a 54-year old man with dual residency in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside
Park, Bergen County, and a 72-year old Bayonne woman. All 3 individuals
have either recovered or are recovering.
Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing
To date, the Department of Health and Senior Services' lab in Trenton has
accepted 1 882 birds for testing. A total of 1 080 birds (1 078 crows, a
blue jay and a cockatiel) found in 17 counties have tested positive for the
presence of WNV. Positive birds have been found in Atlantic (2), Bergen
(194), Burlington (13), Camden (5), Cape May (4, including a blue jay),
Essex (102), Gloucester (5), Hudson (64), Hunterdon (5), Mercer (11),
Middlesex (225), Monmouth (152, including a cockatiel), Morris (54), Ocean
(16), Passaic (83), Somerset (35) and Union (110) Counties.
In addition, avian testing conducted through the New Jersey Division of
Fish & Wildlife has detected WNV in 3 wild bird specimens: an American
Kestrel found in Cape May, a blue jay in Middlesex, and a Cooper's Hawk
found in Union County.
Mosquito & House Sparrow Testing
A total of 43 mosquito pools collected in Bergen (22), Essex (2), Hunterdon
(1), Middlesex (3), Monmouth (3), Passaic (9), Sussex (2) and Union (1)
Counties have tested positive for the presence of WNV. In total, 14 110
mosquito pools from all 21 counties have been collected by the Rutgers
Mosquito Research and Control Unit and tested by the Department of Health
and Senior Services and/or the CDC.
In addition to mosquitoes, the CDC also analyzed blood samples taken from
541 house sparrows collected in Bergen, Passaic and Sussex County in late
July. No sparrows with WNV were discovered in New Jersey.
Sentinel Chicken Testing
Blood samples are taken weekly from sentinel chicken flocks placed in all
21 counties and tested by the New Jersey Department of Agriculture for the
presence of WNV. To date, 4 chickens, stationed in Essex, Middlesex, Morris
and Sussex Counties, have tested positive for WNV. The National Veterinary
Services Lab (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, has confirmed the test results. Sentinel
chickens previously reported by the Monmouth County Mosquito Extermination
Commission (18 Sep 2000) as being positive for WNV were re-tested by the
New Jersey Department of Agriculture and NSVL and were negative for the virus.
Horse Testing
A total of 13 horses from Atlantic (2), Burlington (2), Cape May (1),
Monmouth (4), Ocean (2) and Sussex (2) Counties have tested positive for
WNV. Equine testing is conducted by the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture's animal health laboratory in Trenton and results are sent to
NVSL for confirmation. A total of 6 horse deaths have been attributed to
the virus.

On 10 Oct 2000, New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D.,
announced that the door-to-door West Nile virus (WNV) survey of households
on Staten Island which began last week was completed on Sun 8 Oct 2000,
ahead of schedule. The survey, which was conducted by the Health Department
and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), received
samples from a total of 877 voluntary participants in 634 households in
randomly selected neighborhoods on Staten Island. Participants in the
survey are scheduled to receive their individual WNV test results within
the next 3 months. Further analysis of survey data will be conducted by the
Health Department and CDC, and results will be made available to the public
within the next 6 months, once the analysis is complete. Information gained
from this survey will help to determine the percentage of people on Staten
Island who may have been exposed to the virus, who is most at risk for
being exposed to mosquitoes infected with WNV, and what were the symptoms,
if any, of people who were exposed to the virus, but were not aware that
they were infected. Households were selected at random, and participation
in the survey was voluntary.

A total of 8 horses were classified this week as having had confirmed cases
of West Nile virus (WNV) infection. Included was the first-ever equine case
of WNV infection in the State of Pennsylvania (Dauphin County); the horse
had no history of movement from the premises in 10 years. Also included
were one horse from Connecticut (Middlesex County) and 6 horses from New
Jersey (Burlington [2, Mercer [1, Monmouth [2, and Ocean [1 counties).
This brings to 23 the total number of equine cases of WNV infection in 2000.
The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) found that 5 of the 8
were WNV-positive on a 1:100 dilution (or greater) of serum on IgM-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Those 5 horses also had
WNV-positive results on a 1:10 dilution (greater) of serum on a
plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). The other 3 horses all had
brain tissue found WNV-positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 2
of the 3 also had WNV isolated from brain tissue. The third horse was found
to be WNV-positive on a 1:1000 dilution of serum on IgM-capture ELISA.

The European Union previously issued import restrictions, effective 15 Sep
2000, for horses originating from the 5 States that have had an equine case
of WNV. No other countries have notified the USDA of any WNV-related
restrictions on the importation of horses.
One new human case of WNV infection was reported this week, a 37-year-old
man from Richmond County, New York. His onset of illness was 10 Aug 2000,
but he was not hospitalized until 27 Sep 2000. There have now been 17 human
cases of WNV infection in 2000, all residents from 5 different counties of
New Jersey and New York.
No additional mammals were reported as WNV-positive this week.
There were 488 more birds reported as positive for WNV during the week. The
first confirmation of WNV activity in the District of Columbia was
reported, as 2 dead crows tested positive. Almost 3 000 birds have now been
documented as infected with WNV in 2000.
One new sentinel chicken was confirmed as WNV-positive in Middlesex County,
New Jersey. This is the third sentinel bird found positive in 2000.
One new county reported a positive mosquito pool: Columbia County, New
York. One new mosquito species was reported positive for WNV, _Culiseta
melanura_. A total of 2 positive pools of _C. melanura_ were collected in
Fairfield County, Connecticut, on 19 and 20 Sep 2000. A total of 21 new
positive mosquito pools were reported this week.
A total of 112 counties in Connecticut (7), District of Columbia (1),
Maryland (5), Massachusetts (10), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (18), New
York (61), Pennsylvania (4), and Rhode Island (4) have had confirmed
findings of WNV in some species of bird or mammal since 1 May 2000. All but
2 counties (109) have detected at least one positive wild bird, with 96
counties in Connecticut (7), District of Columbia (1), Maryland (3),
Massachusetts (8), New Hampshire (2), New Jersey (16), New York (55),
Pennsylvania (1), and Rhode Island (3) reporting 2 or more confirmed
findings of WNV-positive birds. Sussex County, New Jersey, and Dauphin
County, Pennsylvania, have had at least one positive horse, but no birds
reported as WNV-positive to date [7 Oct 2000. A total of 20 counties, 2 in
Connecticut (Fairfield, New Haven), 2 in Massachusetts (Norfolk, Suffolk),
5 in New Jersey (Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Monmouth, Passaic), and 11 in
New York (Bronx, Columbia, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Queens,
Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester), have had at least one wild bird
and at least one mosquito pool reported as positive.
The following is a Summary of all West Nile virus-positive findings from 1
May 2000 through 7 Oct 2000: 17 Humans, 23 Equines, 25 Other Mammals, 2 998

Human Morbidity? Request for Information
----------------------------------------
I have not seen many references to long-term health effects for humans
infected by the West Nile virus. Are there any studies monitoring the
health of those infected in the New York metropolitan area during the 1999
outbreak? Recently, I saw a quote by Dr. Paul Epstein in the Ottawa Citizen
that stated, "Of the 62 survivors [of West Nile Virus infection, most are
suffering from neurological disabilities." It seems that morbidity, rather
than mortality, from West Nile virus infection could be the key public
health problem. I would be interested in knowing of any studies or
individuals focusing on this dimension of the problem.
