DPJ working group asks Kan for foot-and-mouth disease public fund
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A working group of the Democratic Party of Japan [DPJ] concerning a
recent epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Miyazaki
Prefecture asked prime minister Naoto Kan on Monday [23 Aug 2010] to
create a public fund to resuscitate the southwestern prefecture's
tattered economy.

Kan told the working team that he intends to reach a conclusion soon,
according to the DPJ group.

''Fund establishment is stated in the special anti-FMD legislation,''
the team's leader, Mitsunori Okamoto, said after submitting to Kan a
report on the status of Miyazaki Prefecture. ''We asked the prime
minister to inject public money thoroughly.''

The livestock industry in Miyazaki has been severely damaged by the
epidemic, which was first reported in April [2010]. Miyazaki
Prefecture plans to set up a 30 billion yen fund [USD 354.3 million].

In Miyazaki, Gov Hideo Higashikokubaru said the prefectural
government plans to declare an official end of the epidemic on Friday
[27 Aug 2010] as intended earlier, saying disposals of animal excreta
have been finished at roughly 80 percent of the 1250 farms affected
by the disease.

The local government had set the date anticipating that the work to
dispose of excreta at the farms will be completed by then.

[Between 26 Mar and 4 Jul 2010, Japan suffered 292 outbreaks of FMDV
serotype O in the Miyazaki prefecture, affecting mainly cattle and
pigs. The most recent follow-up report, No 15, was submitted to the
OIE on 28 Jul 2010. Japan is still to declare the outbreak as
resolved. All reports, and a map showing all outbreaks, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9155>.

An official final report of this significant event, with lessons to
be drawn, is anticipated. At present, one has to suffice with the
detailed, illustrated chronology included in Wikipedia
