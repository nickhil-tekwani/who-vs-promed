County and state health officials on Friday [30 Jul 2010] said
several people have become ill after consuming water from a privately
owned public water supply near Hebgen Lake. The Montana Department of
Public Health and Human Services [DPHHS] has confirmed 14 cases of
_Campylobacter_ gastrointestinal illness, a common sickness, the
Gallatin County Health Department said in a statement Friday morning
[30 Jul 2010].

Information collected about the cases "strongly suggests that
exposure occurred at the Campfire Lodge Resort," according to the
statement. At least 70 more cases are considered "probable."

Along with county health agents and DPHHS, the Montana Department of
Environmental Quality, and Madison County Health Department are
involved in the probe.

"The good news is that we believe the likely source that has been
causing these illnesses has been identified," Shelley Nolan of DEQ
[Department of Environmental Quality] said in the statement.

Gallatin County health officer Matt Kelley said the risk to public
health is minimal because the likely source has been discovered. "We
believe the risk to public health from a well at this particular
establishment has been eliminated at this time...," he said. "The
investigation will continue looking at all possible sources that
might be causing this outbreak in order to ensure the public's safety."

The owners of the resort are cooperating with the probe, and have
taken action to prevent future illnesses, Kelley said in the statement.

[The specific source of campylobacteriosis in this outbreak is not stated.

_Campylobacter jejuni_ causes a generally self-limited diarrheal
illness after exposure to a dose of usually 10 000 or more organisms.
Most infections occur after an incubation period of 2-4 days
presenting with fever, malaise, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The
diarrhea may range in severity from loose stools to bloody diarrhea.
10 to 20 per cent of those infected may have symptoms lasting more than 1 week.

Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) occurs uncommonly after
campylobacteriosis, 1 case per about 2000 infections. 20 to 50 per
cent of GBS is linked to campylobacter infection, usually arising 2-3
weeks after the diarrheal illness. Certain O types of _C. jejuni_ (19
and 41) are more highly linked to GBS. Reiter's syndrome (a reactive
arthritis) can also occur in genetically-predisposed individuals
after infection with a number of agents of bacterial diarrhea.

Most cases of _C. jejuni_ infection resolve without therapy, but
erythromycin or ciprofloxacin have been used. - Mod.LL]
