Ministry says dioxins found in German animal feed
-------------------------------
Animal feed produced by a firm in eastern Germany tested positive in
January 2003 for carcinogenic dioxins, and over 100 tonnes of
possibly contaminated feed could have been exported to the
Netherlands, officials said.
Germany's Agriculture Ministry said in a statement that the Dutch
authorities had been informed.
Tests in January had shown animal feed produced by the company in the
state of Thuringia contained around 15 times more than the permitted
level of dioxin. Dioxin has been linked to several cancers in humans,
including lymphomas and lung cancer.
Some 300 pigs that had been given the feed had to be slaughtered
after tests showed high levels of the poison, according to a
statement on Thuringia's Agriculture Ministry Web site.
The firm was ordered to halt feed production on 31 Jan 2003 and test
its entire production for dioxins, the ministry said. The company was
not identified.
"According to test results published today, it cannot be ruled out
that feed delivered before 31 Jan 2003 was contaminated with
dioxins," it said.
Dioxin comes from both natural and industrial sources, such as
medical and municipal waste incineration and paper pulp production.
It enters the food chain when animals eat contaminated plants,
building up in the fat of mammals and fish.
