A fresh outbreak of the contagious African swine fever [ASF] has been detected in Lusaka province. The outbreak has been reported in Lusaka's Shimabala area. An outbreak of African swine fever in Lusaka late last year [2013] killed more than 3000 pigs, prompting the government to put in place measures to contain the disease.

In the fresh outbreak, a total of 162 pigs have already been slaughtered at Chikupi Vocational Training centre in Shimabala area by a combined team of ZNFU [Zambia National Farmers Union] and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock staff after tests showed that pigs on the farm had ASF, the ZNFU confirmed. It, however, said samples collected from about 5 surrounding farms were negative.

But agriculture minister, Wlybur Simuusa, said the Ministry of Agriculture had continued conducting tests on pigs in the area. "I am waiting for an official report because when I asked my people they said that outbreak in Lusaka was sorted out. However, they are going in the area to see whether that is the case or not", Simuusa said in an interview. He said the government was however ready to combat the outbreak: "...we are ready. We already demonstrated that, remember there was an outbreak in Lusaka and Southern Province and we contained it although it resulted in the slaughter of pigs. We have since compensated all the affected farmers", Simuusa said.

He urged farmers to play their part in keeping ASF out of the country. "...Of course if the new reports are confirmed, we will swing into action. The only thing is we need [cooperation] from farmers as well. If those new reports in Lusaka are confirmed, it means that our same farmers didn't follow the measures we put after the earlier outbreak," said Simuusa. "We insist that pigs should be [confined] in piggeries or in a fence but you find our farmers, they just leave the pigs roaming around, they don't keep them clean and you find our efforts [are in vain]. That is a serious concern. We need to work together."

Meanwhile, pigs in Luangwa district have continued to die from suspected ASF. More than 40 pigs have died in the last one month, according to veterinary officials in the district. The disease was reportedly detected last week when 20 pigs were found dead in INDECO compound, Chidada and Soweto villages, which are the most affected areas, according to Zanis [Zambia News and Information Services]. Officials are said to be worried about the disease spreading further as people in affected areas were throwing the carcasses in open areas, creating more danger to the communities.

ASF is a highly contagious viral disease that could kill 95 to 100 per cent of affected pigs. In Zambia, the 1st outbreak was reported in 1994.

[The outbreak, which reportedly started in Lusaka on 8 Nov 2013, remained solitary and was declared officially "resolved" on 1 Apr 2014 (see Zambia's final OIE report of 9 Jul 2014 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=15555).

The immediate notification of the said event included the following description of the affected population: "The cases are on commercial and semi-commercial farms rearing exotic pig breeds (mainly landrace, large white, and crosses, etc.). The pigs are housed in permanent buildings and mortalities have involved both young and old." The statistics were: out of 37 117 susceptible swine, there were 189 cases of which 180 died and 4627 were destroyed. No slaughtering was reported. The control measures applied were, according to the report: quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, and zoning. The epidemiological comment was: epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak and its extent.

No explanation was provided for the destruction of about 12 per cent of the susceptible, exposed population; have only animals with clinical signs been destroyed? Or those of a certain age group?

In view of the current remarks of Zambia's Minister of Agriculture, it will be interesting to obtain, on the one hand, data on the considerations upon which the decision to declare the event resolved were taken earlier this year (2014), and on the other hand, an updated evaluation of Zambia's ASF situation as seen on the ground.

ASF is a viral, OIE listed highly infectious disease of swine; it is not zoonotic. So far, no vaccine has become available. - Mod.AS
