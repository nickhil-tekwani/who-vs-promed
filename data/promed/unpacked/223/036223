Bovine Botulism Alert Sounded Jun 28 2003
-----------------------------------------
The Irish Government is bidding to reduce the risk of botulism hitting the
country's cattle herds. And Liam Aylward, Minister of States at the
Department of Agriculture and Food, confirmed that there was a continuing
problem with bovine botulism in different areas of the country.
He said that recently-reported cases were believed to have been caused by
cattle coming into contact, either directly or indirectly, with poultry
litter contaminated with decaying poultry carcases. Risks to cattle
increased during summertime.
Mr Aylward pointed out that, under an EU animal by-product regulation
recently adopted in the country, the spreading of organic material other
than farmyard manure on pasture land was forbidden. This would include
chicken carcase material, which must be removed from litter before spreading.
In the context of addressing the animal health issue associated with the
identified risk to cattle from poultry litter, Mr Aylward advised farmers
to take the following precautions:
- accept litter only from poultry farmers who have adequate systems in
place to ensure all poultry carcases are removed from houses, stored and
disposed of according to good practice
- vehicles used for the transportation of animal fodder should not be used
for the transportation of poultry litter or any other waste material,
including chicken carcase material
- do not chop litter, and check lands thoroughly after spreading to ensure
the pasture is carcase-free
- spread litter on tillage land, if possible and again check tillage land
thoroughly to ensure land is carcase-free
- animals should not be grazed on lands on which litter has been spread
- do not make baled silage from lands where litter was spread
- avoid spreading and stockpiling litter in warm weather
- sites for litter stacks must be on dry ground, vermin-proof and remote
from all water sources and proximity to livestock (including on
neighbouring farms)
- avoid spreading near waterways and follow local advice on recommended
levels of animal manure for land spreading.

[Botulism is a highly fatal toxemia caused by ingestion of the toxin of
_Clostridium botulinum_. There are 8 recognized types and subtypes of the
organisms. Botulism toxins C and D, which are the ones related to cattle,
are generally regarded as non-pathogenic to humans. In many cases, and
probably in the current case, the suspicion is based upon clinical
observations of the characteristic motor paralysis and the elimination of
other causes of motor paralysis. Laboratory confirmation is difficult and
not always possible. It is based upon toxicity of stomach and intestinal
filtrates in mice, but a negative answer -- which is not exceptional -- is
unreliable.
Vaccines against _Cl. botulinum_ toxins types C and D in cattle and other
farm animals (small ruminants, horses) are available and widely applied in
countries such as Australia, South Africa, and Israel.
