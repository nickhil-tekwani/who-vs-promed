Mysterious cattle disease breaks out in Zambia
-----------------------------------------------
A mysterious and deadly cattle disease has broken out in Gwembe
district in southern Zambia, local newspaper Times of Zambia
reported Tue 13 Apr 2004.
Philip Mweehe, an official in Gwembe district, was quoted as saying
animals were dying within 24 hours after contracting the disease,
whose symptoms include diarrhea, adding that the animals were
also found with lumps when they were skinned.
He urged veterinary officers to rush to the area and investigate the
nature of the disease before the cattle population was wiped out.

[The description of the "outbreak" in southern Zambia is rather
deficient. Acute diarrhea in bovines, combined with high mortality,
might have multiple, various causes -- both infectious and
non-infectious -- including poisons, helminths and others. Obviously,
the 1st disease to be considered, and hopefully ruled out by the
diagnosticians, is rinderpest.
Lumpy skin disease -- which might seem to be indicated by the
mentioning of "lumps" -- is endemic in Zambia, [but] it has a rather
lengthy course and does not include diarrhea as a typical symptom,
while mortality rates usually do not exceed 20 percent. - Mod.AS]
