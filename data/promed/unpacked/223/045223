Since its first detection in China in the mid-1990s, the Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus of the Asian lineage has
shown many special features, and in particular:
i) capability to infect and cause disease in many different species
of both poultry and wild birds as well as in mammals
(<http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/science/ahaw/ahaw_opinions/1484.html>); and
ii) very rapid and worrisome geographical spread in Asia, Europe and
Africa in 2005 and 2006, while previously it only occurred in
south-eastern Asia, with limited spread to a few countries in the Far East.
(<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?PHPSESSID=c291e72672e227dd84085d13f728b4a6&page=disease_outbreak_map&disease_id=15>)
As regards the role played by poultry and wild birds, evidence has
accumulated suggesting that both populations have indeed played a
significant role in recent virus evolution and spread, while all
information available indicates that mammals, including humans, have
only been a "cul de sac" of the infection, at least so far.
The emergence of the Qinghai Lake sub-lineage of the H5N1 virus in
spring 2005 probably represents an important milestone in the spatial
evolution of this virus. It followed extensive virus circulation in
domestic poultry in southeast Asia; and indeed it has been suggested
that the HPAI H5N1 virus was introduced in that region of China via
trade in live poultry. Following the emergence of that sub-lineage,
which caused extensive mortality in wild birds in the Qinghai lake,
the H5N1 virus spread in a very alarming manner in central, southern
and northern Asia and Europe, including 14 out of 25 EU Member States
and 10 non-EU countries (<http://disasters.jrc.it/AvianFlu/Europe/>),
the Middle East and Africa in the 2nd half of 2005 and early 2006.
Circulation of HPAI H5N1 in poultry -- particularly ducks and geese
-- in Southeast Asia has probably been very important for virus
evolution [See ProMED-mail posting 20061031.3116, referenced below])
As regards Europe, overwhelming evidence has accumulated (see the
reports published by the European Commission and the OIE) that its
wide geographical spread has been mostly if not entirely linked to
wild birds, and in particular to waterfowl.
In the EU, strong circumstantial evidence supported by molecular
epidemiology data shows that a number of outbreaks in domestic
poultry as well as infection in domestic and wild carnivores (cat,
stone marten, mink) have actually originated from infected wild birds
(see page 140 of the following:
<http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/704&type=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en>http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/06/704&type=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en>;
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/ai_part2_en.pdf>).
Outbreaks in domestic poultry have been successfully controlled and
this has probably prevented re-infection of wild birds. However,
following an outbreak in backyard poultry in Denmark which originated
from wild birds, infection of a magpie from those poultry has been described
(<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_16.HTM#Sec11>).
As regards the Middle East and Africa, there is no clear evidence
either that the disease has been introduced via wild birds or via
trade in domestic poultry or poultry meat. The latter hypothesis has
been suggested to take trade patterns into account; however,
molecular epidemiology data would indicate that at least in some
circumstances the former might be true [see ProMED-mail archive
2006211.0457, referenced below].
Many aspects of the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 are still unknown and
need further study. In recent months, the virus seems to have
disappeared from Europe. If in the next months this is confirmed, it
would indicate that wild birds are unlikely to act as a permanent
virus reservoir. This could be due to the very high lethality rate of
the infection. However, the reasons behind the wide spread of virus
via wild birds in Europe in the 2nd half of 2005 and early 2006
remain largely unknown.
In conclusion, wild birds seem to act more as spreaders of the HPAI
H5N1 virus than reservoirs. This would suggest that the HPAI H5N1
virus behaves in wild birds differently than the Low Pathogenic avian
influenza viruses, that are endemic in wild birds, mainly waterfowl,
and not usually found in domestic poultry. However, the persistence
of the HPAI H5N1 virus in domestic birds in some areas of Asia and
Africa might again lead to contamination of wild birds, which may
then spread the virus into uninfected areas via migration.
<http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/nature_conservation/focus_wild_birds/avian_influenza/pdf/avian_influenza_report.pdf>
Indeed, migration of wild birds, and in particular of waterfowl, may
lead to new large epidemics involving uninfected areas. This would
depend on many factors including species composition and assemblage,
moult and cold migrations, species, sex- and age-differentiated
pattern of migration, use of habitat and space, together with the
mixing of waterfowl population migrating from different continents in
some crucial areas (Western Siberia, for example)
(<http://www.wetlands.org/publication.aspx?ID=c1831ef9-8e19-46ef-9ccf-e0fd59068df0>
and
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/diseases-cards/conference/documents/Spread%20of%20HPAI%20from%20the%20West%20Siberian%20Lowland%20to%20the%20Eastern%20Meditrranean%20and%20beyond.pdf>
However, if wild birds are not acting as a permanent reservoir of
HPAI H5N1, the chances for successful control and eradication of the
virus worldwide will increase. However, disease surveillance and
early detection in domestic poultry and wild birds and separation
between these 2 populations will continue to be of paramount
importance to achieve this very important goal.

EU animal health experts have tightened rules for the import of live
captive birds as part of the bloc's strategy to fight bird flu, the
EU's executive Commission said in a statement on Thursday. "Under the
regulation agreed today, only specific countries or regions which
have already been approved to export live commercial poultry will be
allowed to export captive birds to the EU," it said.
The list of countries approved to export live captive birds to the EU
would be limited to those already approved to export live poultry to
EU markets, it said. These were Australia, Canada, Chile, Croatia,
Israel, New Zealand and the United States, along with certain states
in Brazil. However, certain 3rd countries that were geographically
close to the European Union would be exempt from the new rules, it
added -- Andorra, Lichtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino,
Switzerland and Vatican City.
"I am very glad that member states could agree to these tighter rules
for captive bird imports," EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer
Protection Markos Kyprianou said. "The devastation that the H5N1
avian influenza virus has caused globally serves as a reminder that
we can take no chances in this area," he said.
The EU's new rules will not apply to certain types of birds,
including commercial poultry and pet birds accompanying their owners,
since these were already covered by separate EU laws. Exporter
countries will have to prove the absence of bird flu as well as the
highly contagious Newcastle disease virus. Birds destined for EU
countries may not be vaccinated against avian flu and all imported
birds will have to be individually identifiable through a leg-ring or
microchip.

I am not an ornithologist. I was trained in ecology and evolution and
now work on human influenza. But I do know my local birds in Orange
County, California. So take it for what it is worth, but I swear I
had a pair of birds at my feeder during 2006 that looked exactly like
those in your link:
<http://tariquesani.net/albums/userpics/DSC_37062843_filtered.jpg>.
They were so striking. I tried to look them up in my Peterson's guide
and of course failed. I don't know if there are any other similar
looking species of Munias, but the dark rusty red face and
characteristic chest were what I was searching on.
Orange County/LA is home to millions of Asian immigrants and a
hospitable climate for immigrant birds as well. I assume they are pet escapees.
I wondered if the hard-core birders in Orange County had seen my
munias. So I went to the web site of our local Audubon society and
found this link: <http://groups.yahoo.com/group/OrangeCountyBirding>
Go there and search on "Munia". [There are 5 entries - Mod.MHJ]. It
is not too clear which or how many species of munias people are
seeing from these notes. But nobody seems surprised by seeing them.
And the posts are several years old.
My friend Tom Smith, an avian ecologist at UCLA, suspects that what I
saw were escaped "cage birds", which makes me wonder whether a call
to a pet store specializing in exotic birds might not shed a lot of
light on this issue.

[So if anyone thinks the EU is being excessively cautious, think
again. If Munias have come in once, they can come in again, and again
