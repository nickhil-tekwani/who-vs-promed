A red fox that attacked 5 people last week [11-17 Nov 2019] in Glen Ridge [New Jersey] has tested positive for rabies, authorities said. Borough police said they responded to a report of an animal bite on Woodland Avenue. 2 additional bites were reported in the borough while police and the Bloomfield Animal Control were searching for the animal. The fox was later found on the NJ Transit tracks near Toney's Brook.

Anyone who has had direct contact with a red fox around [14 and 15 Nov 2019] is advised to seek out medical attention, borough police said on a Facebook post. In particular, if a pet came in contact with a red fox on those 2 days, owners are asked to contact a veterinarian, police said.

Police in North Jersey had to previously euthanize a raccoon in September [2019] when the animal attacked 2 people and was later tested positive for rabies.

[In the USA, there exist several wildlife variants of _Lyssavirus_, that circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

While bat rabies is found throughout the USA, main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Foxes are common carriers of rabies in New Mexico, Nevada, and Alaska, not in New Jersey (see map at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html). The main hosts for rabies in New Jersey are raccoons.

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all domestic carnivores (that is, dogs, cats, ferrets) in the area up to date and not to approach wildlife with unusual behavior. - Mod.PMB
