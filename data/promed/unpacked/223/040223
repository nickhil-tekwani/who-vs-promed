Northern deer carried virus
---------------------------
Indiana wildlife managers came across a startling discovery while working
deer check stations last fall [2007]. EHD (Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease)
appears to have found its way into northern counties after biologists
previously thought the outbreak was contained to southern counties.

"Signs of low levels of EHD were seen in some deer examined in Marshall,
Kosciusko, LaGrange, Whitley, and Pulaski counties," wildlife research
biologist Chad Stewart said during a meeting of the Hoosier Outdoor Writers
recently. "The good news is that none of the deer we examined died because
of it."

Indiana biologists say EHD poses no danger to humans that handle or eat the
meat of an exposed animal, but a deer bitten by a bug carrying the disease
develops flu-like symptoms and often dies. On the bright side, said
Stewart, deer that survive the virus EHD develop an immune response that is
transmitted onto their young. The immunity could be good news for northern
Indiana deer that contracted the disease last fall.

The EHD virus is carried by biting midges (also known as no-see-ums) and
caused several deer fatalities in some southern counties in the past 2
years. Drought is believed to have exacerbated the midge population and
caused the deer die-off.

It was so serious in southern Indiana that Stewart believes much of a 20
per cent decline in the 2007 harvest within counties hit hardest can be
attributed to EHD. But he has reason to believe those herds will rebound.
"Where EHD affected other counties in 2006, the herd bounced back in 2007,"
Stewart said. "In most cases, antlered harvests were back up to 2005
levels." Also, a hard freeze generally will take care of the midge problem.

As predicted, Indiana's 2007 deer harvest was down slightly but still
ranked the 3rd highest on record. Of the 124 427 deer killed by hunters
statewide, 49 367 were antlered bucks. About 44 per cent of the antlered
bucks and 38 per cent of the adult does harvested were yearlings. Stewart
was pleased with the number of does taken during the latter part of the
firearms season and the muzzleloader season. That makes it easier for
biologists to maintain deer populations. "Antlerless deer are shot at a
2-to-1 margin over the last 9 days of the firearms season, and 80 per cent
of the harvest during the muzzleloader season is antlerless, with the
majority of those being does," Stewart said. "Without those efforts, the
deer herds in some areas could rise dramatically."

Steuben County led the state in total harvest with 3754. Kosciusko County
ranked 3rd (3003) while Marshall was 5th (2854). St Joseph County hunters
took 1259 deer, Elkhart 1359, and LaPorte 2285. Benton County produced the
lowest harvest with only 134 deer taken.

The antlered buck harvest exceeded 1000 in only 5 counties, including
Kosciusko. Antlered deer made up at least 50 per cent of the total harvest
in 87 of the 92 counties, including all of those in northern Indiana.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is closely related to bluetongue virus
infection (BTV). Both diseases are carried by biting midges. Recently
Europe has experienced a significant upswing in BTV. It also moved further
north than had previously been thought possible. EHD may be following a
similar pattern. This could indicate the virus is changing its virulence or
has become more resistant to cold weather [climate change? - Mod.SH]. The
virus has, in some way, changed its character. As such it means
veterinarians and producers in more regions not previously seeing EHD will
now need to add this disease to their differential list. - Mod.TG]
