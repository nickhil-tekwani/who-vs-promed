West African health ministers in joint fight against Ebola
----------------------------------------------------------
Ministers of Health from Guinea -- which is combating a new Ebola outbreak -- and neighbouring countries have agreed on a unified front to combat the virus that re-emerged about 3 weeks ago.

The meeting was opened by His Excellency, the Prime Minister of Guinea, Dr Ibrahima Kassory Fofana in Guinea's capital, Conakry on [2 Mar 2021]. Ministers and government representatives from Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, and Sierra Leone attended the inter-ministerial meeting.

"If in 2014 Guinea and the neighbouring countries were victims of Ebola, this time around Guinea and the region are resolutely facing up to Ebola," said H.E. the Prime Minister.

The ministers agreed in a final declaration to set up a coordination mechanism, enhance cross-border collaboration, including working with communities, to support the efforts in containing the virus. They also agreed to facilitate import regulations for vaccines and drugs as well as promote measures that were effective in bringing the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa under control.

Guinea declared an outbreak on [14 Feb 2021] after cases were confirmed positive for Ebola in a rural community in N'Zerekore prefecture, which lies near the border with Cote d'Ivoire and Liberia. As of [2 Mar 2021], 17 cases (13 confirmed, 4 probable) had been reported.

"We are greatly encouraged by the common front taken by Guinea's neighbours to tackle this outbreak. We know from experience how much this is critical in fighting Ebola," said Dr Abdou Salam Gueye, Regional Emergency Director at the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa. "With close cross-border trade and social ties, we cannot ignore the importance of regional approaches against health crises."

In support of Guinea's health authorities, WHO and partner organizations have ramped up response to the outbreak. Ebola vaccinations were launched just 9 days after the outbreak was declared. To date, 1317 people have been vaccinated and 32 000 vaccine doses have so far been delivered.

All the 6 countries bordering Guinea are stepping up readiness. Surveillance and screening are being stepped up at border crossing points and in high-risk communities. Rapid response teams are being deployed to border areas to support the preparedness plans of health districts. Testing and treatment facilities are being scaled up and work to ensure communities take full ownership and rally around public health responses is underway.

North Kivu: Provincial Minister of Health calls on traditional healers to get involved in the fight against Ebola
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Provincial Minister of Health, Dr Nzanzu Salita, invites traditional healers to get involved in the fight against the 12th Ebola epidemic. He made this call on Tuesday [2 Mar 2021], during an exchange he had with them. According to the minister, during the epidemic period, some patients flee conventional structures to seek treatment from traditional healers.

"This is why we wanted to sound the alarm among traditional healers to be vigilant, especially since we have all been trained in integrated disease surveillance and response so that they can help us alert patients who show signs resembling Ebola and COVID-19. They understood the magnitude of the threat and promised to lend us a hand," said Dr Nzanzu Salita.

Expressing their commitment to the fight against Ebola and COVID-19, these traditional healers pleaded for the provision of personal protective equipment, in order to protect themselves against Ebola in their various centers.

The provincial health minister has promised to find a solution to this request in the near future.

[Bringing the traditional healers into the response to combat Ebola would be very helpful. But they are at high risk of infection when treating infected patients. If they could be provided with personal protective equipment, they would be less likely to become infected themselves and thus unlikely to transmit the disease to naive individuals who come to seek care or accompany those who do. - Mod.LK]
