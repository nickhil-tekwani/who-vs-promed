Rescue of the coconut industry is among several food security
programmes set for the coming year [2012], Food Production Minister
Vasant Bharath announced. He also said that there were unique selling
advantages in crops such as coconut and pineapple.

The minister said the local coconut industry had been 80 percent
decimated by red ring disease, and a biological expert was expected in
the country at the end of the year [2011] to help treat the problem
and save the industry.

[Red ring disease of palms is caused by the nematode _Bursaphelenchus
cocophilus_. Around 20 species of tropical palms are known to be
affected, the most important crops being coconut, oil and date palm.
The disease was 1st described in Trinidad in coconut palms in 1905,
where today it kills an estimated 35 percent of coconut seedlings. It
has been reported from areas of Central America, South America and
many Caribbean islands. Red ring is considered one of the most
important palm wilts with an estimated annual yield loss of 15 percent
to coconut and oil palm industries in affected areas.

Symptoms may vary with host species but generally include a several
centimeter wide reddish ring visible only when the trunk is cut,
followed by leaf distortion with or without discolouration and
necrosis, crown reduction, stunting, and almost always death of the
palm. The nematodes live mainly in the trunk tissue of the red ring,
but the reason for this confinement is not yet known. The American
palm weevil _Rhynchophorus palmarum_, which is attracted to fresh
trunk wounds, appears to act as a primary disease vector, although
additional weevils and other insects may also be involved for certain
areas or palm species.

Disease management relies mainly on techniques to reduce vector
numbers and sources of nematode inoculum, such as phytosanitation,
vector trapping, insecticides, and selective elimination of infected
palms.
