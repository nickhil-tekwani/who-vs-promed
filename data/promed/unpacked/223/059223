RE: PRO/AH> Rinderpest - Kenya: OIE, suspected
----------------------------------------------
This is indeed an alarming event, as would be any occurrence of rinderpest
anywhere in the world, as we get close to its final eradication. As your
moderator suggests, events have moved quickly in the last 2 years, and
there is now growing confidence based on tangible surveillance data that
the Horn of Africa rinderpest reservoir is indeed the last.
We need to view this event as a tremendous opportunity, for there are
several very positive elements. Not least it confirms that rinderpest is
still present in eastern Africa, that its movement out of the conjectured
centre of endemic maintenance in the southern Somali pastoral ecosystem can
be detected, and that our recent improved understanding of rinderpest
epidemiology is valid. The events of Meru last year and Laikipia this year
fit well with the predicted epidemic cycle of Lineage 2 rinderpest virus.
It is a long time since there was a primary suspicion of rinderpest in
Kenya in cattle, leading to much speculation about subclinical rinderpest
and wildlife, as if the mildness of the strain in cattle were a fixed
attribute. If the investigations taking place now result in the
identification of African Lineage 2 rinderpest virus as the cause, we will
have convincing evidence that this clade has retained its ability to evolve
a more virulent characteristic. Many of us involved in rinderpest
eradication believe that the eastern African herders are able to detect not
just such episodes of exalted virulence but also when the mild virus is
moving through their herds, even if they give it a different name. This
episode tends to confirm that areas where the virus is active can be
detected by appropriately orientated surveillance combining conventional
reporting and investigation systems with participatory disease search
techniques.
This event also highlights the fact that a recrudescence of cattle plague
from this source remains a risk so long as any reservoir of rinderpest
virus is left and cattle move in trade. Almost all countries in the world
in both Africa and Asia have moved away from reliance on annual, pulsed,
mass vaccination campaigns. Now as herd immunity levels decrease and
vulnerability increases, there is an urgent need for all stakeholders to
focus action on eliminating rinderpest from what is almost certainly the
last reservoir left in the world.
So, one can only hope that this event, alarming as it is for the Kenyan
Department of Veterinary Services and African Union's Inter-African Bureau
of Animal Resources, focuses minds on the final thrust for rinderpest
eradication. Through AU IBAR's PACE (Pan-African Programme for the Control
of Epizootics) funded by the European Union, the prospects are better now
than ever before if the opportunity is seized and all stakeholders work
together in a concerted manner.

[The Rinderpest virus is phylogenetically divided into 3 lineages: 2
originating in Africa (African virus lineage 1 and 2) and one originating
in Asia (Asian virus lineage). African rinderpest virus lineage 2 seems to
have been widespread in the African continent, covering both West and East
Africa, while lineage 1 was generally restricted to East Africa. Lineage 2
escaped detection for about 30 years because of a change in virulence which
rendered the virus imperceptible. For further details refer to "Rinderpest:
a case study of animal health emergency management" by A.K. Mukhopadhyay,
W.P.Taylor and P.L. Roeder in Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz., 1999, 18
(1), 164 - 178. - Mod.AS]
