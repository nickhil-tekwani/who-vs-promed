99/170 First report of beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus in Syria [edited]
Surveys were carried out in Syria during 1996-1998 to detect rhizomania
(beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus - EPPO A2 quarantine pest). Rhizomania
is the most severe virus disease on sugar beet in Syria according to a
recent survey. Samples (2019) were collected from 290 sugar beet fields in
Homs, Aleppo and Hama governorates and were tested by DAS-ELISA. Results
of the survey were as follows: Homs governorate near Qsair (79% of fields
infected, average incidence 44%); Aleppo governorate (76% of fields
infected, average incidence 41%); and in Hama governorate, (16% of fields
infected, average incidence 16%). In The EPPO Secretariat had previously
no data on the occurrence of beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus in Syria.

[Rhizomania disease is caused by beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus which
is transmitted to healthy beet seedlings by the soil-inhabiting fungus,
_Polymyxa beta_. The disease is fairly common in Eurasia and the
Mediterranean region. Data (percent of sugar beet acreage infected)
provided by Bernd Holtschulte of KWS Saat AG, a major international seed
company in Einbech, Germany, shows that the disease is present in Syria
(24%), Iran (10%), Turkey (10%), Lebanon (30%), but it has not been
reported in Egypt or Pakistan. According to FAO sources, sugar beet
production in Syria is about 750 000 metric tonnes. - Mod.DH]
