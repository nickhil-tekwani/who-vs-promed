--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Recently discovered tick-borne phleboviruses have been associated with severe disease and death among persons in Asia and the United States. We report the discovery of a novel tick phlebovirus in Tasmania State, Australia, that is closely related to those zoonotic viruses found in Asia and North America.

Background
----------
In 2009, an outbreak of an acute febrile illness, known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), occurred in China. During an investigation of the outbreak, a previously unknown bunyavirus from the tick _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ was identified as the causative agent of SFTS. In June 2009, in northwestern Missouri, United States, 2 men from 2 geographically distant farms were hospitalized for fever, fatigue, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Both men had been bitten by ticks 5-7 days before the onset of symptoms. A virus was isolated from the leukocytes of each patient and later identified as a novel phlebovirus by next-generation sequencing.

Subsequent to these disease events in China and the United States, fatal SFTSV [SFTS virus] infections were reported in humans in Japan and Korea. Because similar viruses and human infections have been detected in 2 well-separated continents (i.e., Asia and North America), it is tempting to hypothesize that similar viruses may also exist in tick populations on other continents. We report the isolation and characterization of a phlebovirus from ticks in Australia that is similar to SFTSV and HRTV.

The Study
---------
In 2002, a disease outbreak occurred in a shy albatross (_Thalassarche cauta_) colony on Albatross Island, a small island in the Hunter Island Group in northwestern Tasmania, Australia. The disease in the albatrosses was characterized by weight loss and death. Serum samples and ticks (_Ixodes eudyptidis_) from healthy and affected birds were sent to the CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization) Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, for diagnostic investigation. Several laboratory tests were conducted to detect potential viral pathogens involved in the disease event.

Conclusions
-----------
We identified a novel tick-borne phlebovirus, HIGV [Hunter Island Group virus], during the investigation of a disease outbreak among shy albatrosses in Tasmania. Genetic characterization showed that the virus is closely related to 2 newly discovered tick-borne zoonotic phleboviruses (SFTSV and HRTV [Heartland virus]) that were responsible for severe disease and death in humans in 4 separate countries in Asia and North America. However, with the current data alone, the particular disease event in the shy albatrosses could not be attributed to HIGV.

The findings from this study demonstrate the key role that a vigilant pathogen investigation has in any diagnostic assessment. The study findings also suggests that zoonotic phleboviruses genetically related to SFTSV, HRTV, and HIGV may be widely distributed in different parts of the world and that heightened international surveillance is needed to fully understand and appreciate the public health risk from these emerging viruses.

[The geographic distribution of this group of related phleboviruses continues to grow. It will be of interest to know the results of the laboratory tests to determine the etiology of the agents responsible for the outbreak in the shy albatross colony, and if it proves to be due to the phlebovirus isolated from the ticks. It would be of interest to know if the virus is still present in the ticks and if the albatrosses have antibodies to it.
