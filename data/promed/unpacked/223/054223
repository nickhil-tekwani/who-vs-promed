A case of African swine fever [ASF] has been found in Rome. This case turns out to be the 1st outside the area from the province of Genoa and extends towards Piedmont up to Serravalle Scrivia, in the Alessandria area.

This was announced by the extraordinary commissioner for emergency, Angelo Ferrari: "Yes, there is a case. The area should be that of the Insugherata park. We are carrying out the necessary checks".

The case was reported and identified by the Zooprophylactic Institute of Lazio and confirmed by the Zooprophylactic Umbria and Marche, the national reference center for this disease.

Following confirmation of the case, monitoring has been activated on the area to control the boundaries of the area concerned. European notification procedures have also started. "Yesterday evening [4 May 2022], following the discovery of a specimen of wild boar dead due to ASF, the task force met", writes the Lazio Region. The administration "will make available from tomorrow the toll-free number of the regional civil protection (803555) to report any findings of dead animals and immediately activate the veterinary services". The Region has also decided to "identify, on the basis of the carcasses found, at the moment only one, the perimeter of the area and allow the interventions that the national commissioner will adopt".

[The above information is in need of official confirmation. ASF was initially reported from Italy's north-western region Piedmond in January 2022. It has spread south-east in the province of Genoa. The distance beween Genoa and Rome is nearly 400 km (249 mi), as the crow flies. In case confirmed, a possible spread related to human traffic will have to be taken into consideration.

A Pig-Progress map showing ASF cases on Italy's mainland is available at https://bit.ly/3w0yWWs.

A new EFSA scientific report, 'Epidemiological analyses of ASF in the European Union (September 2020 to August 2021)', has just been published. Its abstract follows:

"This report provides a descriptive analysis of the African swine fever (ASF) Genotype II epidemic in the affected Member States in the EU and 2 neighbouring countries for the period from 1 Sep 2020 to 31 Aug 2021. ASF continued to spread in wild boar in the EU, it entered Germany in September 2020, while Belgium became free from ASF in October 2020. No ASF outbreaks in domestic pigs nor cases in wild boar have been reported in Greece since February 2020. In the Baltic States, overall, there has been a declining trend in proportions of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive samples from wild boar carcasses in the last few years. In the other countries, the proportions of PCR-positive wild boar carcasses remained high, indicating continuing spread of the disease. A systematic literature review revealed that the risk factors most frequently significantly associated with ASF in domestic pigs were pig density, low levels of biosecurity and socio-economic factors. For wild boar, most significant risk factors were related to habitat, socio-economic factors and wild boar management. The effectiveness of different control options in the so-named white zones, areas where wild boar densities have been drastically reduced to avoid further spread of ASF after a new introduction, was assessed with a stochastic model. Important findings were that establishing a white zone is much more challenging when the area of ASF incursion is adjacent to an area where limited control measures are in place. Very stringent wild boar population reduction measures in the white zone are key to success. The white zone needs to be far enough away from the affected core area so that the population can be reduced in time before the disease arrives and the timing of this will depend on the wild boar density and the required population reduction target in the white zone. Finally, establishing a proactive white zone along the demarcation line of an affected area requires higher culling efforts, but has a higher chance of success to stop the spread of the disease than establishing reactive white zones after the disease has already entered in the area."
