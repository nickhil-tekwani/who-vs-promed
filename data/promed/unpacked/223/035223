Headlines
- The circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak in Syria, which was 1st detected in 2017, has been successfully stopped. The announcement came at the heels of an official outbreak response assessment, comprising of experts in public health, epidemiology and virology, who reviewed evidence and concluded the outbreak was closed. [http://www.emro.who.int/syr/syria-news/polio-outbreak-successfully-stopped.html]

- On [27 Nov 2018], the 19th IHR Emergency Committee including members, advisers, and invited Member States convened to discuss the status of international spread of poliovirus. The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of polio spread continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and proposed an extension of Temporary Recommendations for an additional 3 months. The Committee expressed concern that complacency to achieving a polio-free world could now become the biggest risk to the effort and urged that all countries and partners regard polio eradication as an emergency. "We have the tools, we need to focus on what works, we need to get to every child," commented Prof. Helen Rees, Chairperson of the Committee. "The reality is that there is no reason why we should not be able to finish this job, but we have to keep at it." Prof. Rees and the Committee urged countries, donors and partners to continue their support, until a polio-free world is achieved, cautioning that failure to eradicate polio would lead to global resurgence of the disease, with potentially as many as 200 000 new cases occurring annually within 10 years. "We have achieved eradication of a disease once before, with smallpox," Rees concluded. "The world is a much better place without smallpox. It's now more urgent than ever that we redouble our efforts and finish this job once and for all as well." The recommendations come amid the notification of the 4th cVDPV circulation in DRC, which underscores the need for sustained partnership, funding, and socio-political resolve.

- The Africa Regional Commission for the Certification of poliomyelitis eradication (ARCC) was held in Nairobi, Kenya, from [12 to 16 Nov 2018]. Made up of 16 health experts, recommendations were made to 10 countries to address issues of disease surveillance gaps, inaccessibility and insecurity.

- The Technical Advisory Groups (TAG) on Polio Eradication in Horn of Africa and Lake Chad Basin convened recently, to review the current status of polio outbreaks in both the regions and provide guidance on the next phase of the outbreak response.

- The GPEI report to the upcoming WHO Executive Board (in January 2019) has been published. The report provides a status update on polio eradication, summarizing programmatic, epidemiological and financial challenges to securing a lasting polio-free world, and introduces the concept of a new extended strategic plan to achieve global certification by 2023, taking into account the fact that circulation of wild poliovirus has not yet been interrupted.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan - 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case and 2 positive WPV 1 environmental samples.
- Pakistan - 9 WPV1 positive environmental samples.
- DRC - 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).
- Nigeria - 4 cases of cVDPV2.
- Somalia - 1 positive cVDPV2 environmental sample.

[Comments from the GPEI/WHO re: approaching eradication]
- Nominal variations (up or down) in the number of newly-reported cases at this point of the polio endgame - although tragic for the affected children and their families - are not operationally overwhelming, especially considering the population size in the 3 remaining endemic countries (upwards of 90 million children aged less than 5 years). However, confirmation of even a single polio case anywhere points to remaining vaccination coverage gaps which must be filled, to achieve eradication.

- Over and beyond case numbers, the GPEI and its partners actively and continuously evaluate a wide range of epidemiological, virological, programmatic, operational, surveillance, financial and social data, the analysis of which drives strategic planning and enables target eradication efforts.

- The 3 remaining endemic countries continue to intensify their eradication efforts, through implementation of national polio emergency action plans. Underpinning these plans is the data analysis, to identify area-specific challenges and reasons why children are being missed (i.e. due to population movement, inaccessibility, lack of infrastructure, inadequate microplanning, resistance, etc), and putting in place area-specific solutions to overcome those reasons. By clearly identifying high risk areas, teams are able to allocate and prioritize technical assistance to those areas. Afghanistan recently concluded a targeted national campaign.

- Analysis in 2018 by both GPEI partners and independent technical advisory groups, reviewing all available evidence, concludes that the near-term feasibility of eradication is possible, if remaining vaccination coverage gaps are rapidly filled, and the GPEI and its partners continue to work towards this goal.

- The aim is to urgently interrupt the remaining strains of wild poliovirus transmission, not only to eradicate such strains in their own right and prevent their global re-emergence, but also to subsequently remove oral polio vaccines (OPV) from routine immunization programmes globally, to eliminate the long-term risks of vaccine-derived polioviruses (VDPVs).

- The ultimate aim of the GPEI is to secure and sustain a world where no child will ever again be paralysed by any poliovirus - be it wild or vaccine-derived.

Afghanistan
- 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case in Uruzgan province, Shahid-e-Hassas district with onset of paralysis on [9 Oct 2018] has been reported. So far, the total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country is 20.
- 2 WPV1 positive environmental samples were reported this week: 1 from Kandahar district, Kandahar province, and 1 from Hilmand province, Lashkargarh district. Samples were collected on [5 Nov 2018].

Pakistan
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) have been reported this week. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 in the country is 8.
9 WPV1 positive environmental samples have been reported: 2 from Rawalpindi district and 1 from Lahore district, Punjab province; Peshawar and Mardan districts from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province; Sukkur and Karachi Gadap districts from Sindh province; Killa Abdullah district, Balochistan province, and Islamabad district, Federal Capital Territory. Samples were collected between [1 and 15 Nov 2018].
- It is important to note that cases are reported this year [2018] from only 4 districts across the country, and that no WPV cases (except 1 from Gadap, greater Karachi) have been reported from core reservoir areas in 2018. 20 years ago, the entirely country was affected by polio, and every year, more than 35 000 children were paralysed for life by the disease.

Nigeria
- 4 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week: 1 from Baure LGA, Katsina state, 1 from Ardo-Kola LGA, Taraba state, and 2 from Damaturu LGA, Yobe state. The onset of paralysis ranged from [22 Oct 2018 to 6 Nov 2018].
- No cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported. The most recently-detected WPV1 case, from Borno state, had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016].
- The country continues to be affected by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, the 1st centered in Jigawa state with subsequent spread to other states as well as to neighbouring Republic of Niger, and the 2nd in Sokoto state.
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 continues, including efforts to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno state.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week. There are 8 total number of cVDPV2 reported cases in 2018 in Niger, which are genetically linked to a cVDPV2 outbreak originating in Jigawa, Nigeria. The virus was isolated from children with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Zinder region, located in the south of Niger and on the border with Nigeria, with dates of onset of paralysis ranging from [18 Jul 2018] through [7 Sep 2018].
- Acute flaccid paralysis surveillance and routine immunization across the country with focus on the infected provinces and the provinces at the international borders with Nigeria are being reinforced.
- WHO and its partners are continuing to support local public health authorities in conducting field investigations and risk assessments to more clearly assess risk of the identified cVDPV2 and to conduct additional response measures as appropriate and necessary.
- Active case finding for additional AFP cases is continuing, and additional surveillance measures such as increasing the frequency and extent of environmental surveillance and community sampling of healthy individuals is being expanded.
- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to strengthen the risk communication and community engagement.

Central Africa
- 2 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in Mufunga-Sampwe district, Haut Katanga province with the onset of paralysis on [6 and 7 Oct 2018]. This is the 4th emerging cVDPV2 affecting the country.
- Previously, DRC was affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2, in the provinces of Mongala, Maniema and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- Following the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication in July 2016, the 2 large scale vaccination rounds implemented during September and October 2018, demonstrated better vaccination quality. Planning is underway to maintain the gains made so far and maintain population immunity as well as sensitive surveillance across the country.
- The polio outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to an ongoing Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network, to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country, to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- 1 positive cVDPV2 environmental sample has been reported in Somalia this week in Waberi district, Banadir province collected on [11 Oct 2018].
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia has reported a total of 12 cVDPV cases (5 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1, coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) in 2018.
- Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in one environmental sample in Kenya.
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally-agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia. Another vaccination round is planned during end-November [2018] as part of the ongoing outbreak response, to further enhance the population immunity in the highest risk areas. Special surveillance activities continue to be undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week.
- The total number of cVDPV1 cases in the country in 2018 is 25.
- Emergency Operation Centres are established and operational at the national level and in all affected provinces; environmental surveillance is functional in 5 sites in 2 major cities.
- 3 Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs) of expanding scope have taken place since late July [2018], from 3 provinces to 9, to nation-wide. The most recent was aimed at children under the age of 15, due to large numbers of poorly-immunized older children.
- Planning is underway for the next steps of the outbreak response, focusing on both vaccination and surveillance for polioviruses.
- Detection and reporting of new viruses or cases at this point in the outbreak response is not unusual or unexpected, as surveillance is being strengthened and most reported and confirmed cases had onset of paralysis prior to the start of comprehensive outbreak response.

[Always start on a positive note - the declaration of the interruption of transmission of the cVDPV2 in Syria is comforting. It is now more than 1 year since the date of onset of disease of the last case of cVDPV2 associated disease in Syria (21 Sep 2017).

The good news being said, the summary statement of newly identified polioviruses is sobering, with 1 new case of WPV1 associated disease (Afghanistan) and 6 new cases of cVDPV associated disease (2 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and 4 in Nigeria). Even more sobering are the positive environmental specimens - 9 in Pakistan and 1 in Somalia. Hence, there is currently evidence of widespread circulation of the WPV in both Pakistan and Afghanistan and several different cVDPVs in the DRC, Nigeria and Somalia. The absence of information on possible cases in Niger, Papua New Guinea and Kenya, do not rule out the possibility of continued circulation of the cVDPVs in those countries as it is too soon to declare interruption of transmission.

See the below discussion on the risk of resurgence of polio, and the cautions expressed by the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus. The risk of donor fatigue, as well as individuals working on the polio eradication effort in all of the countries is very great, as the continued need to postpone the estimated date for declaration of actual interruption of poliovirus circulation (both WPVs and cVDPVs) worldwide.

[2] Resurgence risk - media report
Date: Fri 30 Nov 2018

Progress has stalled in ridding the world of polio. An emergency committee of the World Health Organization unanimously agreed on [Fri 30 Nov 2018] to continue to designate the paralyzing disease a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern". WHO originally designated polio in this way in 2014, deeming it a health threat serious enough to endanger communities worldwide.

This year [2018], WHO has recorded 27 cases of wild poliovirus worldwide, compared with 22 total cases last year [2017]. Though the small number of cases may appear insignificant, the committee said the trend is noteworthy because it shows stagnation.

Poliomyelitis, which is transmitted person-to-person through the fecal-oral route or through contaminated food, mainly affects young children. Fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs are symptoms of the disease, which also can cause permanent paralysis. There is no cure for polio, and it can be prevented only by vaccine.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, a partnership of WHO, UNICEF, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary International and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was initiated 30 years ago. In 1988, polio was endemic in 125 countries and sickened 350 000 children annually, but as a result of the public-private initiative, polio is now endemic in just 3 nations -- Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan -- while total cases have dropped more than 99%, according to WHO.

On [Fri 30 Nov 2018], the WHO emergency committee praised the "continued high level commitment seen in Afghanistan and Pakistan," yet it noted that the number of wild polio cases in Afghanistan has almost doubled in 2018, with 19 cases reported this year, compared with 10 at the same time last year [2017]. In Pakistan, the 2018 polio situation is stagnant compared with last year [2017], while in Nigeria, more than 2 years have passed since the last case of poliovirus [this refers to the wild poliovirus - WPV, see above for information on the outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus - cVDPV outbreaks in Nigeria in 2018 - Mod.MPP] was detected, the committee noted.

In 2016, Nigeria reported a case of wild poliovirus after 2 years with none; WHO committee members did not speculate when the nation, which recorded 27 cases of vaccine-derived polio this year [2018], would be declared free of the disease.

Additionally, outbreaks of various strains of vaccine-derived polio in Somalia, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Papua New Guinea and Somalia continue to be of "major concern," the committee said, given that these viruses have rarely spread across borders.

Vaccine-derived polio occurs when the weakened vaccine virus in the oral polio vaccine is excreted and then spreads in the community, according to WHO. The solution for stopping this type of polio is the same as for all polio outbreaks, according to WHO: every child must be immunized several times with the oral vaccine.

Many countries remain vulnerable, according to WHO. "Gaps in population immunity," including in Western nations, would allow the disease to be imported into a nation where polio no longer exists.

If polio eradication around the globe is not accomplished in the next couple of years, a resurgence of the disease is likely -- much like what is occurring now with measles, the WHO emergency committee said. On [Thu 28 Nov 2018], WHO reported that measles cases, which occurred in all world regions, spiked in 2017 and led to an estimated 110 000 deaths.

[The full official statement of the 19th IHR Emergency Committee regarding the international spread of poliovirus can be found at: https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-11-2018-statement-of-the-nineteenth-ihr-emergency-committee-regarding-the-international-spread-of-poliovirus. Below are the conclusions of the Committee meeting:

"The Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The Committee considered the following factors in reaching this conclusion:

- "Although the declaration of the PHEIC and issuance of Temporary Recommendations has reduced the risk of international spread of WPV, progress is fragile, and should international spread now occur, the impact on WPV eradication would be even more grave in terms of delaying certification and prolonging requirements for dedicated human and financial resources in support of the eradication effort. The reversal in progress in Afghanistan and the stagnation in Pakistan with exportation of WPV continuing between the 2 countries, heighten concerns.

- "There is a risk of global complacency as the numbers of WPV cases remains low and eradication becomes a tangible reality, and a concern that removal of the PHEIC now could contribute to greater complacency.

- "Many countries remain vulnerable to WPV importation. Gaps in population immunity in several key high-risk areas is evidenced by the current number of cVDPV outbreaks of all serotypes, which only emerge and circulate when polio population immunity is low as a result of deficient routine immunization programmes.

- "The international outbreak of cVDPV2 affecting Somalia and Kenya, with a highly diverged cVDPV2 that appears to have circulated undetected for up to 4 years, highlights that there are still high-risk populations in South and Central zones of Somalia where population immunity and surveillance are compromised by conflict.

- "Similarly, the new spread of cVDPV2 between Nigeria and Niger highlights the significant risk of persisting type 2 outbreaks 2 years after OPV2 withdrawal, and the inability so far to prevent further spread within and outside Nigeria through application of consistently high quality mOPV2 SIAs is a concern.

- "The difficulty in controlling spread of cVDPV2 in DR Congo heightens these concerns and demonstrates significant gaps in population immunity at a critical time in the polio endgame; the low coverage with routine IPV vaccination in several countries neighboring DR Congo heightens the risk of international spread, as population immunity is rapidly waning.

- "Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in several countries currently infected with WPV or cVDPV, i.e. Afghanistan, Nigeria and Somalia, which all have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for prolonged periods.

- "The increasing number of countries in which immunization systems have been weakened or disrupted by conflict and complex emergencies pose another risk. Populations in these fragile states are vulnerable to outbreaks of polio.

- "The risk is amplified by population movement, whether for family, social, economic or cultural reasons, or in the context of populations displaced by insecurity and returning refugees. There is a need for international coordination to address these risks. A regional approach and strong cross­border cooperation is required to respond to these risks, as much international spread of polio occurs over land borders."
