[For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual , Chapter 2.3.2, Infection with _Aphanomyces invadans_ (epizootic ulcerative syndrome), from which the following commentary is quoted: http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_aphanomyces_invadans.htm

" Infection with _A. invadans_ is a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and farmed freshwater and estuarine fish. It has a complex infectious aetiology and is clinically characterised by the presence of invasive _A. invadans_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions, typically leading to a granulomatous response. Infection with _A. invadans_ is most commonly known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS). It is also known as red spot disease (RSD), mycotic granulomatosis (MG) and ulcerative mycosis (UM). In 2005, scientists proposed that the disease should be named epizootic granulomatous aphanomycosis; however, the term EUS continues to be used by most scientists. The disease is caused by the oomycete fungus _ Aphanomyces invadans_. Infection with _A. invadans_ has spread widely since the first outbreak in 1971 in Japan and to date only one genotype has been recorded. Parasites and rhabdoviruses have also been associated with particular outbreaks, and secondary Gram-negative bacteria invariably infect lesions caused by _A. invadans_".

During 2015, 1 outbreak of EUS was reported in South Africa. The outbreak was resolved on 1 Oct 2015, a final report was sent to the OIE on 11 Apr 2016. See updated report and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18293. - Mod CRD]
