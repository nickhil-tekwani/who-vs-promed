Outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections linked to backyard poultry
---------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update on 29 Jul 2020, 408 more ill people and one additional _Salmonella_ serotype (Newport) were added to this investigation.

As of 22 Sep 2020, a total of 1346 people infected with one of the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 49 states.

Total / 1346

Illnesses started on dates from 14 Jan 2020 to 28 Aug 2020. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 95 years, with a median age of 34 years; 58% are female. Of 698 people with information available, 229 (33%) have been hospitalized. One death in Oklahoma has been reported.

If antimicrobials are needed, some infections related to these outbreaks may be difficult to treat with some commonly recommended antimicrobials and may require a different choice. Whole genome sequencing performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from 1083 ill people and 2 environmental samples showed predicted antimicrobial resistance to one or more of the following antibacterials for 718 isolates: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (1.8%), ampicillin (4.1%), cefoxitin (1.8%), ceftriaxone (1.8%), chloramphenicol (0.8%), ciprofloxacin (0.2%), fosfomycin (2.6%), gentamicin (1.1%), kanamycin (0.4%), streptomycin (59.2%), sulfisoxazole (4.2%), tetracycline (59.3%), and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (2.3%). There was no resistance predicted for 367 (33.8%) isolates. Testing of 12 outbreak isolates using standard susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory showed resistance to streptomycin and tetracycline in 3 isolates and no resistance in 9 isolates (fosfomycin and kanamycin were not tested by this method).

Investigation of the outbreaks
------------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence shows that contact with poultry (such as chicks and ducklings) in backyard flocks is the likely source of these outbreaks. In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 613 people interviewed, 416 (68%) reported contact with chicks and ducklings before becoming ill. Testing of backyard poultry and their environments (such as backyard coops) in Kentucky and Oregon found 3 of the outbreak strains.

Ill people reported buying poultry from many sources, including agricultural stores, websites, and hatcheries. No single store chain or hatchery accounts for all of the illnesses.

Regardless of where backyard poultry are purchased, they can carry _Salmonella_ germs that can make people sick. Backyard poultry owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their flocks.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.
