Following the death of 2 captive elephants at the Theppakadu Elephant Camp recently, precautionary measures have been taken to ensure that whatever afflicted the 2 animals does not spread to the remaining 22 elephants. Both Narmada and Bharathi died within a few weeks apart, prompting the Forest Department to take steps to ensure that the remaining animals do not contract the same illness.

Both animals showed similar symptoms, contracting diarrhoea before dying suddenly. Forest veterinarians and department officials suspected that both animals could have died from similar causes.

After their death, the remaining 22 elephants were shifted to Madhagavail, Bombax, Bison Road and ET Mara camps. Forest Department officials said Madhagavail and Bison Road camps have 4 elephants each, while 8 were at Bombax, and 6 at ET Mara camp. This was to isolate the animals and ensure that the disease remained under check. Moreover, the elephants are being fed nutritious food at the camps and are also being given a course of antibiotics. Faecal and urine samples have been sent for forensic test to the veterinary college in Namakkal.

E. Vijayaraghavan, forest veterinarian, said lab results from Narmada and Bharathi tested negative for anthrax, and that they were still waiting for results to identify the cause of their death. The department is still awaiting test results of the water samples collected from Moyar River.

[It has been confusing to try to work out what was happening with these sick and dying elephants. Hopefully the real cause(s) will be determined shortly. - Mod.MHJ
