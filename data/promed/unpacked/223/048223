[So far in 2006,] 82 people, including 19 children, have been poisoned by
wild mushrooms in Ukraine, and 3 of the adults died. As was noted by the
press-service of Ministry of Health, the highest numbers of mushroom
poisonings have been registered in the Kiev (15 people), Rovno (11 people),
Dnepropetrovsk (8 people), and Chernigov (6 people) regions.
Mushroom poisonings are [usually accidental], that is, victims believe they
used edible mushrooms. The majority of poisonings [are related to] the use
of lamellar poisonous mushrooms -- _Amanita phalloides_, _Amanita
muscaria_, _Hypholome_ (false armillaire), Lycoperdaceae and others --
which are mistakenly thought to be edible, or conditionally edible
mushrooms that [when they crack open] secrete lacteal juice --
_Lycoperdaceae_, _Morchella_ and others -- as a result of inappropriate
culinary processing. There are other factors in poisonings: where mushrooms
are gathered, the age of mushrooms, and so forth).
Symptoms of poisoning develop from 30 minutes to 24 hours following
ingestion. Mushroom poisoning is quite often is complicated by the use of
alcoholic drinks.
A major concern is the poisoning of children. In fact feeding mushrooms to
children under 8 years old is categorically contraindicated. Experts
recommend that pregnant or nursing mothers not ingest mushrooms.
According to physicians, the main reason for fatalities is the delay of
medical assistance.

The following is from an essay by David Kaminstein, MD, in the Gale
Encyclopedia of Medicine (December 2002), available on the Health A to Z
website
<http://www.healthatoz.com/healthatoz/Atoz/ency/mushroom_poisoning.jsp>:
"Mushroom poisoning refers to the severe and often deadly effects of
various toxins found in certain types of mushrooms. One type, known as
_Amanita phalloides_ [Ap], also known as "death cap," accounts for the
majority of cases. The toxins initially cause severe abdominal cramping,
vomiting, and watery diarrhea which proceeds to liver and kidney failure.
"The highest reported incidences of mushroom poisoning occur in western
Europe, where a popular pastime is amateur mushroom hunting. Since the
1970s, the United States has seen a marked increase in mushroom poisoning
due to an increase in the popularity of "natural" foods, the use of
mushrooms as recreational hallucinogens, and the "gourmet" value of wild
mushrooms. About 90 per cent of the deaths due to mushroom poisoning in the
United States and western Europe result from eating Ap. Ap is recognized by
its metallic green cap (the color may vary from light yellow to greenish
brown), white gills (located under the cap), white stem, and bulb-shaped
structure at the base of the stem. A pure white variety of this species
also exists.
"Poisoning results from ingestion of as few as 1 to 3 mushrooms.
"Poisonous mushrooms contain at least 2 different types of toxins, each of
which can cause death if taken in large enough quantities. Some of the
toxins found in poisonous mushrooms are among the most potent ever
discovered. One group, known as amatoxins, blocks DNA production. This
leads to the death of many cells, especially those that reproduce
frequently such as those in the liver, intestines, and kidney. Other
mushroom poisons affect proteins needed for muscle contraction, and
therefore reduce the ability of certain muscle groups to perform.
"There is no specific antidote for mushroom poisoning. However, several
therapeutic advances have decreased the death rate over the last several
years. Early replacement of lost body fluids has been a major factor in
improving survival rates. Therapy is aimed at decreasing the amount of
toxin in the body. Initially, attempts are made to remove toxins from the
upper gastrointestinal tract by inducing vomiting or by gastric lavage
(stomach pumping). After that, continuous aspiration of the upper portion
of the small intestine through a nasogastric tube is performed, and oral
charcoal (every 4 hours for 48 hours) is given to prevent absorption of
toxin by the body. These measures work best if started within 6 hours of
ingestion.
"In the United States, early removal of mushroom poison by way of an
artificial kidney machine (dialysis) has become part of the treatment
program. This is combined with the correction of any imbalances of salts
(electrolytes) dissolved in the blood, such as sodium or potassium. An
enzyme called thioctic acid and corticosteroids also appear to be
beneficial, as do high doses of penicillin. In Europe, a chemical taken
from the milk thistle plant, _Silybum marianum_, is also part of treatment.
When liver failure develops, liver transplantation may be the only
treatment option.
"The mortality rate has decreased with improved and rapid treatment.
However, according to some medical reports, death still occurs in 20-30 per
cent of cases, with a higher mortality rate of 50 per cent in children less
than 10 years old.
"The most important factor in preventing mushroom poisoning is to avoid
eating wild or non-cultivated mushrooms. For anyone not expert in mushroom
identification, there are generally no easily recognizable differences
between nonpoisonous and poisonous mushrooms. It is also important to
remember that most mushroom poisons are not destroyed or deactivated by
cooking, canning, freezing, drying, or other means of food preparation."
