Question: Who should supporters of SatelLife contact to express their
displeasure with litigation initiated by Healthnet HMO of California to
strip SatelLife of its healthnet identity?
Answer from Holly Ladd: <Dan_T_Niccum@notes.fh.com>. He is their vice
president for external matters and provided us [SatelLife with his e-mail
address when he responded to messages from folks on the Afronets list.
