Nursery School Pupils Sick with Strange Illness
-----------------------------------------------------------
About 20 pupils from a single class in a nursery school in Jiayuan
District in Hankou have fallen ill, and the class has been suspended.

A [parent] explained that his 3-year old, Xing Xing (pseudonym), is
in the school's 5th class. On the morning of the 20th [20 Nov 2007],
Xing Xing suddenly had pain in his mouth. His parents brought him to
Wuhan Municipal Children's Hospital where it was discovered that the
inside of his mouth was covered with ulcers, rashes had appeared on
his extremities, and he had a mild fever.

Inside the hospital, [the family] bumped into 8 other pupils and
their parents from the same class. All of the pupils' symptoms were
extremely similar. The parents estimate that about 20 pupils in the
school's 5th class have contracted this type of illness. On Wed 22
Nov 2007, the classroom was found to be completely empty. This
[information] was reported to the Wuhan Disease Control Center.

Yesterday [23 Nov 2007], an official with the nursery school told
reporters that from the 19th of this month [Mon 19 Nov 2007], pupils
had been developing this strange type of illness. To avoid further
transmission, the school asked that all students in the 5th class
stay home to rest.

An official with the Epidemic Prevention Department of Jiangan
District Disease Control Center said that about 20 pupils have fallen
ill and that the diagnosis cannot yet be confirmed. Workers have
already disinfected the nursery school and arrangements were made for
experts to conduct observation.

[Dan Silver has indicated that Hankou is part of the city of Wuhan in
Hubei Province. A map of the province of Hunei can be accessed at

HealthMap of China can be accessed at

The description of this disease is compatible with an outbreak of
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), a disease which has been
reported from other regions of East Asia recently. HFMD is a common
viral illness of infants and children, most frequently affecting
children under 10 years of age and infants. HFMD is characterised by
fever and vesicles in the mouth and on distal extremities. Additional
complications are uncommon in most outbreaks.

Further information on the extent and diagnostic features of this
outbreak of disease would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
