The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment [CDPHE] says
2 people have died because of an outbreak of listeriosis. The CDPHE
says it is working with Denver Public Health and Denver Environmental
Health after 3 cases of listeriosis were reported since 20 May 2011.
All 3 cases involved people of Hispanic or Latino heritage, according
to the CDPHE. The 2 people who died were a man in his 30s and a woman
in her 60s.

"These cases are very concerning to us because we have seen 3 in over
a little more than a week, and usually we see only 10 cases a year. So
this is very concerning to us," Alicia Cronquist, an epidemiologist,
said. The CDPHE says Colorado averages 10 cases of listeriosis a year.
The source of the outbreak is still unknown.

People who are at high risk for _Listeria_ infection include people
with weakened immune systems from transplants or certain chronic
diseases, immunosuppressive therapies or medications; pregnant women;
and people age 60 and older. Healthy people rarely contract
listeriosis, according to the CDPHE.

Symptoms can include fever and muscle aches and also can include
diarrhea, headache, stiff neck, confusion and convulsions. Listeriosis
also can cause miscarriages and stillbirths. Antibiotics can cure it
and prevent the fetus from being infected.

Recommendations for those at high risk:
--------------------------------------
Cheeses
-------
- Do not eat soft cheese such as feta, queso blanco, queso fresco,
brie, Camembert, blue-veined, or panela (queso panela) unless it is
labeled as made with pasteurized milk. Make sure the label says, "Made
with pasteurized milk."

Meats
-----
- Do not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts, other deli meats
(e.g., bologna), or fermented or dry sausages unless they are heated
to an internal temperature of 165 F or until steaming hot just before
serving.
- Avoid getting fluid from hot dog and lunchmeat packages on other
foods, utensils and food preparation surfaces. Wash hands after
handling hot dogs, luncheon meats and deli meats.
- Do not eat refrigerated pate or meat spreads from a deli or meat
counter or from the refrigerated section of a store. Foods that do not
need refrigeration, such as canned or shelf-stable pate and meat
spreads, are safe to eat. Refrigerate after opening.

Seafood
-------
- Do not eat refrigerated smoked seafood unless it is contained in a
cooked dish, such as a casserole, or unless it is a canned or
shelf-stable product. Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon,
trout, whitefish, cod, tuna and mackerel is most often labeled as
"nova-style," "lox," "kippered," "smoked" or "jerky." These fish
typically are found in the refrigerator section or deli counters of
grocery stores and delicatessens. Canned and shelf-stable tuna, salmon
and other fish products are safe to eat."

General recommendations
-----------------------
>From the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

- Thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources, such as beef, pork or
poultry, to a safe internal temperature. For a list of recommended
temperatures for meat and poultry, visit
http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/IsItDoneYet_Magnet.pdf.
- Rinse raw vegetables thoroughly under running tap water before
eating.
- Keep uncooked meats and poultry separate from vegetables and from
cooked foods and ready-to-eat foods.
- Do not drink raw (unpasteurized) milk, and do not eat foods that
have unpasteurized milk in them.
- Wash hands, knives, countertops and cutting boards after handling
and preparing uncooked foods.

[The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in a prior
ProMED-mail post Listeriosis - USA: (NC, MA), alert 20071230.4186:

"_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely
distributed in nature. The organism can be found in soil, water,
silage, raw vegetables, raw meat and poultry, raw and pasteurized milk
[but see *** below], soft cheeses, kitchen premises, and in the
intestinal tract of many animals, including cattle, sheep, and humans,
and in crustaceans, fish, shellfish, ticks, and insects. Most human
infections are foodborne, although vertical transmission can occur
from mother to fetus transplacentally or during delivery through an
infected birth canal, and localized skin infections can occur in
veterinarians and farmers by direct contact with infected animals.

Contamination of food can occur in nature, e.g., raw vegetables
contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk by infected cows, or
[contamination can occur] following subsequent cooking or other
processing.

Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, it
is not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with
ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable products that have
been held at refrigeration temperatures. Listeria can also survive in
frozen food. Consumption of raw milk, raw-milk soft cheeses (e.g.,
brie, camembert, and Mexican soft cheeses), coleslaw, pate, deli
meats, and hotdogs has been sources of human listeriosis. The sources
of human infection can be pinpointed by DNA identification techniques
matching _Listeria_ spp isolated from a possible source with a species
recovered from a patient."

***In reference to the statement in the first paragraph of these
comments, above: reports have suggested that _L. monocytogenes_ is
relatively resistant to heat, which has raised concern about the
effectiveness of pasteurization for eliminating this organism from
milk (Bryan FL. Listeria monocytogenes. In: Riemann H, Bryan FL, eds.
Food-borne infections and intoxications. 2nd ed. New York: Academic
Press, 1979:266-8; Bearns RE, Girard KF. The effect of pasteurization
on _Listeria monocytogenes_. Can J Microbiol 1958;4:55-61). In an
outbreak of listeriosis that occurred in Massachusetts in 1983,
pasteurized whole or 2 percent milk was implicated as the source of
infection (Fleming DW, Cochi SL, MacDonald KL, et al. Pasteurized milk
as a vehicle of infection in an outbreak of listeriosis. N Engl J Med
1985;312:404-7). An inspection of the milk-producing plant detected no
apparent breach in the pasteurization process. In addition, 2 percent
of pasteurized milk samples from more than 700 U.S. milk-producing
plants were culture-positive for _Listeria_ species, primarily _L.
monocytogenes_, in a survey conducted during 1987 and 1988 as part of
the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Dairy Product Safety
Initiatives (Food and Drug Administration. FDA's dairy product safety
initiatives: 2nd year status report to the states. Washington, DC: US
Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service,
1988).

However, the U.S. CDC has noted that several studies have shown that
_L. monocytogenes_ is inactivated by standard milk pasteurization
practices and that contamination of pasteurized milk in the reports
cited above were most likely due to improper methods of pasteurization
or post-pasteurization contamination (see
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001316.htm).
