The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is investigating a case of necrotizing fasciitis (NF) involving a man aged 50. This is the 4th case reported in the past 2 weeks by the CHP.

The patient, with underlying illnesses, has presented with left hand swelling and redness since 21 Sep 2014 and was admitted to Yan Chai Hospital on the same day. He has been managed in the Intensive Care Unit since 22 Sep 2014 and is currently in a critical condition. His clinical diagnosis was left hand NF.

The patient's left hand wound swab yielded _Vibrio vulnificus_ (VV), a type of bacteria which can cause NF, upon preliminary laboratory testing by Princess Margaret Hospital. He has no recent travel history. His home contacts were asymptomatic. Investigations by the CHP are proceeding.

"NF is a serious bacterial infection of the soft tissue and fascia. It can destroy tissue and cause death within 12 to 24 hours after infection," a spokesman for the CHP explained.

VV may cause an infection of the skin when open wounds are exposed to warm seawater. These infections may lead to skin breakdown and ulceration. In some people, vibrio may then infect the blood stream, causing a severe and life-threatening illness. This illness may be characterized by fever, chills, decreased blood pressure, and blistering skin lesions. While healthy people also can get sick, people with compromised immune systems may be at higher risk for invasion of the organism into the bloodstream and potentially fatal complications.

[The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap10.html:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.

The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.htm). - Mod.LL
