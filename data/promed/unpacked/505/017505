Emerging Virus in Raccoons May Provide Cancer Clues
---------------------------------------------
Rare brain tumors emerging among raccoons in Northern California and Oregon may be linked to a previously unidentified virus discovered by a team of researchers, led by scientists from the University of California (UC), Davis. Their findings, published on 12 Dec 2012 in the journal 'Emerging Infectious Diseases,' could lead to a better understanding of how viruses can cause cancer in animals and humans. [Reference: F. N. Dela Cruz et al. Novel Polyomavirus associated with Brain Tumors in Free-Ranging Raccoons, Western United States. Emerging Infectious Diseases, Volume 19, Number 1; January 2013. Abstract reproduced below. - Mod.CP].

Necropsies conducted since March 2010 by scientists at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine and UC Davis-led California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory found brain tumors in 10 raccoons, 9 of which were from Northern California, the article reports. The 10th was sent to UC Davis by researchers at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.

The common factor, found in all of the tumors, was a newly described virus, dubbed raccoon polyomavirus. Researchers suspect this virus contributes to tumor formation. Polyomaviruses, which are prevalent but rarely cause cancer, do not typically cross from one species to another, so the outbreak is not expected to spread to people or other animals.

Two more raccoons with the tumor and the virus have been found in Yolo and Marin counties since September 2012, when the article was submitted to the journal for publication. "Raccoons hardly ever get tumors," said study author Patricia Pesavento, a pathologist with the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine. "That's why we take notice when we get 3 tumors, much less 12."

Polyomaviruses are known to cause cancer under laboratory conditions. Less is known about their ability to cause cancer under natural conditions among people, because cancer often takes decades to develop. Raccoons, with their short lifespans of 2 to 3 years, can provide a model for studying how these viruses spread outside the laboratory, how they cause cancer, and how easily they can jump from species to species.

Of the 12 raccoons affected, 10 were collected from Marin County. Pesavento said this does not mean the virus is limited to that county, or even to Northern California. Marin County is home to WildCare, an animal rescue and rehabilitation center that routinely submits animal remains for diagnostic testing, which might result in a sampling bias. Other California raccoons were submitted by Lindsay Wildlife Museum in Contra Costa County and Sonoma Wildlife Rescue. Pesavento said her lab is collecting specimens and data from other sources across the country, looking for the virus and for raccoon exposure to it. Pesavento said more research is needed to understand whether an environmental toxin, genetics or other explanation is contributing to the cancer. The study said that raccoons are exposed daily to human waste, garbage, environmental toxins and environmental pathogens as they travel along sewer and water lines.

"This is just the beginning of a story," said Pesavento, adding that high rates of cancer among wildlife are found in animals that live in close proximity to humans. "Wildlife live in our fields, our trash cans, our sewer lines, and that's where we dump things. Humans need to be guardians of the wildlife-human interface, and raccoons are important sentinel animals. They really are exquisitely exposed to our waste. We may be contributing to their susceptibility in ways we haven't discovered."

Infectious pathogens, such as viruses, are associated with 15-20 percent of all human cancers worldwide, according to the American Cancer Society. For example, human papillomavirus can lead to cervical cancer. Feline leukemia virus, for which UC Davis developed a vaccine, can cause cancer in cats. UC Davis also continues to study Marek's disease, a deadly virus in chickens that is providing insight into human cancer.

"This work to investigate natural associations of cancer verifies the importance of our One Health approach to addressing complex biomedical problems, such as viral causes of cancer," said Michael Lairmore, dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine, of which the UC Davis One Health Institute is a part. "Understanding how infectious agents may contribute to cancer in animals has provided fundamental new knowledge on the cause of cancer in people."

[The abstract of the original paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, which is more specific, reads as follows:

"Tumors of any type are exceedingly rare in raccoons. High-grade brain tumors, consistently located in the frontal lobes and olfactory tracts, were detected in 10 raccoons during March 2010-May 2012 in California and Oregon, suggesting an emerging, infectious origin. We have identified a candidate etiologic agent, dubbed raccoon polyomavirus, that was present in the tumor tissue of all affected animals but not in tissues from 20 unaffected animals. Southern blot hybridization and rolling circle amplification showed the episomal viral genome in the tumors. The multifunctional nuclear protein large T-antigen was detectable by immunohistochemical analyses in a subset of neoplastic cells. Thus, raccoon polyomavirus may contribute to the development of malignant brain tumors of raccoons."

[The authors interpret these observations as indicative of an outbreak of a specific disease, rather than isolated events, because a retrospective case search and literature review of more than 700 necropsies of raccoons from from California and other regions of the United States and Canada showed only 2 primary brain tumors in raccoons, both classified as low-grade astrocytomas. Because of the consistent anatomic location of the tumors, their absolute association with a specific virus (the novel raccoon polyomavirus isolated by the authors, and the expression of a specific tumour antigen, they reasonably infer infer that that this novel raccoon polyoma virus might plays a role in (as yet undefined) in tumourigenesis. Furthermore they observed that in their sampling of tissues from affected and unaffected raccoons, viral genomic sequences were limited to the neoplastic tissue of the brain and olfactory tract.

It remains to be determined if tumour production property is transmissible to uninfected raccoons or related specie. The polyomaviruses comprise a large group of DNA viruses which characteristically are transmitted as persistent infection. Dome polyomaviruses have oncogenic potential in rodents and one of the human viruses, JC polyomavirus, can induce brain tumours in monkeys. The pathogenic potential of polyomaviruses is diverse and the disease-producing potential of the raccoon polyomavirus will be a subject of considerable interest.

In humans, onset of viral-associated cancer typically occurs decades after initial infection with a transforming virus; however, free-ranging raccoons are short lived (approximately 2-3 years), so this naturally occurring transformation event must be relatively rapid. Natural models of viral-induced tumorigenesis provide an excellent opportunity to analyze mechanisms of transmission, transformation, viral persistence, and routes of shedding and infection. Raccoons are undeniably successful in the human suburban environment and have been proposed as a sentinel species for environmental contaminants and exposure to pathogens.

Raccoons in the affected geographic region have a nomadic suburban lifestyle and use sewer and water lines for travel and presumed daily exposure to urine, garbage, environmental toxins, and environmental pathogens, including polyomaviruses, which have been consistently detected in raw urban sewage samples worldwide.
