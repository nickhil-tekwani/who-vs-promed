The Northern Territory banana industry will know next week whether or not
the destructive Tropical Race 4 strain of Panama Disease is the one that's
been detected on a farm outside Darwin.
Plant samples have been sent to Queensland for testing, and quarantine and
government officials will today meet with the grower to discuss quarantine
for the 16 hectare farm.
As Sarah Hawke reports, if confirmed it'll be third outbreak of Tropical
Race 4 in two years.
(Sarah Hawke) "The soil-borne disease is one of the major threats to the
industry. However, the Territory has had the only outbreaks in Australia.
The other infected farms required eradication of banana plants and fencing
to ensure the disease isn't spread from the soil. Tropical Race 4 slashes
production and once plants are eradicated bananas cannot be grown on that
soil for a number of years." Quarantine spokesman for the Department of
Primary Industries, Ian Quilduff, says it's hard to quantify just how much
of the farm is infected.
(Ian Quilduff) "Because the spores build up in the soil and because of this
movement of machinery the chances of it spreading into the other areas is
very high."

[Panama disease of banana is caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. cubense
(Foc). There are no effective means of controlling the disease caused by
Foc Tropical Race 4. Infected plantations usually have to be abandoned.
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that officials in the New
South Wales Department of Agriculture have found an outbreak of Panama
disease near Coff's Harbor, NSW which indicates that the disease is no
longer confined to the Northern Territory. Plantation owners have been
apprised of the danger of moving infected plant material to other sites -
