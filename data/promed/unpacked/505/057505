Health officials in Caraga, Davao Orientale, in the Philippines have confirmed that the diarrhea outbreak experienced here early this week was caused by cholera, as the disease spread to 6 more villages. Three residents -- aged 11 months and 36 and 57 years old -- died of the disease that has affected a total of 461 people as of Friday [4 Feb 2022].

Dr. Chris Anthony Limen, the municipal health officer, said the laboratory test results from the rectal swabs taken on the patients and tests on the town's water sources were yet to be released. But he believed it was a cholera outbreak. "An ordinary diarrhea can fully be treated in 2-3 days. And it is not life-threatening. But cholera is an acute diarrhea that could be fatal and requires longer days of treatment. Bowel movement could not be stopped, and the stool is smelly," said Limen.

The outbreak, which was first detected in 9 subvillages of Barangay Santiago on 29 Jan [2022], had already spread to 6 other villages: Barangay San Jose, San Miguel, and Sobrecarey had 2 cases each; and Barangay Poblacion, Pichon, and Don Leon Balante had 1 each. The bulk of patients came from the village of Santiago, at 417. About 154 of the patients were aged below 16; 240 were from 16 to 59 years old; and 30 were 60 years and older, Limen said.

The diarrhea outbreak was blamed on Santiago's contaminated water source. In November [2021], they were reportedly advised to constantly sanitize the facility after a diarrhea outbreak in the village a month earlier. Of the 80 cases last year [2021], one turned out positive for cholera. Leaking pipes and a polluted reservoir have allegedly caused the contamination. Some PHP 20 million [USD 390 203] was allocated by the provincial government for the water system's rehabilitation, but work has yet to begin.

Limen warned villagers against drinking water from their faucets or using it for washing their utensils unless they boil it for at least 20 minutes. But municipal disaster risk reduction and management officer Melanie Ybanez said some families still defied the warning. Limen noted that one patient, who had already been discharged from the Davao Oriental provincial hospital in Mati City, started vomiting again.

Limen called for donations of purified water for the diarrhea-stricken villages. He also asked the local government to subsidize the cost of distilled water to be distributed to residents and assign purified water refillers for supply that could be used to clean utensils. Limen also said they were running out of intravenous fluids, since every patient would consume 6 bottles in 24 hours. A moderately dehydrated patient would require 3-5 days of rehydration, while a severely dehydrated one would need at least a week.

The commissioner of health in Kaduna State, Dr. Amina Muhammed-Baloni, has said that cholera outbreaks killed 175 people across the 23 local government areas [LGAs] of Kaduna State in 2021. Baloni spoke when receiving cholera-testing equipment donated by the WHO to the state in Kaduna, which were meant for the Zonal Cholera Laboratory located at the Late Yusuf Dantsofo Memorial Hospital in Tudun-Wada.

Dr. Baloni told journalists that Kaduna reported 175 deaths due to cholera outbreaks in 2021, as almost all the 23 LGAs in the state were hit by the disease. She said the donation by the world health body will go a long way to enhance the containment of the disease in the state.

Represented by the permanent secretary, Adamu Mohammed-Mansir, Baloni said, "As far as the issue of cholera was concerned in 2021, virtually all the local government areas had cases of cholera and casualties. So this effort by the WHO, concern about the health matters around the world, came at the right time, because this will enhance our capability to not only do the rapid diagnostic test, but also to know the type of cholera in the state. So we thank WHO for its support to Kaduna State."

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
