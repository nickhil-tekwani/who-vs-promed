The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is warning consumers not to
use certain jars of Earth's Best Organic 2 Apple Peach Barley
Wholesome Breakfast baby food because of the risk of contamination
with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause botulism, a
life-threatening illness or death. Consumers are warned not to use
the product even if it does not look or smell spoiled.
The affected product was sold in single individual jars and in
variety packs (which contain 4 jars of the apple peach barley and
other varieties). The food is part of the firm's "2nd Vegetables,
Fruits and Blends" line intended for babies 6-months and older. The
food was distributed through retail stores and sold through the
Earth's Best website. If consumers have any of the specified jars in
their home, they should not use them and destroy them immediately. To
date, no illnesses have been reported to FDA or the manufacturer in
connection with this problem.
The [consumer information of the] affected baby food is as follows:
Earth's Best Organic 2 Apple Peach Barley Wholesome Breakfast (4.5
ounce jars); UPC: 23923-20223; Lid: PF6J14 NP; Exp: 14 SEP 08 A
Earth's Best Organic 2 Wholesome Breakfast Variety Pack (12 pack);
UPC: 23923-20295; Exp: 13 SEP 08
Earth's Best Organic 2 Apple Peach Barley (4.5 ounce jars within 12
pack) UPC: 23923-20223 Lid: PF6J14 NP; Exp: 14 SEP 08 A
Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, usually causes
illness within 18-36 hours of exposure. Initial indication of illness
in infants is decreased frequency or absence of stools. Other signs
and symptoms noted are poor feeding, weak suck, lethargy,
listlessness, weak cry, decreased body tone, and diminished overall
movement. Difficulty with swallowing may be evident as secretions
drooling from the mouth. This may be followed by decreased
respiratory effort, which may lead to respiratory arrest from airway
occlusion from unswallowed secretions. Older populations who may be
consuming the product as part of a pureed diet might experience
symptoms such as blurred vision, dizziness, dry mouth, and
progressive weakness from head to legs. Constipation and urinary
retention are also common. Caregivers or people observing these
problems should seek immediate medical attention for those affected.
Hain Celestial Group initiated a recall of the food on 9 Feb 2007.
The recall is ongoing. Production and distribution of the product has
been suspended as FDA and the company work to determine the source of
the problem. Hain Celestial Group distributed 4072 cases of the
specified individual jars consisting of 24 jars per case and 38 298
variety packs with the specified jars.
Consumers who have questions should contact Hain Celestial Group at
1-800-434-4246.
