Recently there was an outbreak of disease among swine in the
Huangjinwei section of Shijingjie in Guangzhou's Baiyun
District. Tests performed at the National Foot & Mouth Disease
Reference Laboratory confirmed that the cause of the outbreak is Type
O Foot & Mouth Disease. A total of 1474 swine fell ill.

Yu Yedong, Vice Director of the Guangdong Bureau of Animal Husbandry
and Veterinary, reported yesterday [1 Mar 2010] that these 1474 swine
along with others from the same herd -- totalling 8382 heads -- were
culled and safely disposed of. There have been no new reports of
animal disease received in the province. There is a sufficient supply
of FMD vaccine in Guangdong, the swine market is steady, and there is
social stability.

[A great many thanks to Dan Silver for translating this piece from
the Guangzhou Daily. It confirms that the disease does not seem to
have spread, even though the OIE report indicates that it has been
over a decade since there has been a serotype O involved in Chinese
outbreaks. It would be critical to know, of course, if the supply of
vaccine mentioned in the article contains the serotype O.

One of the challenges in controlling FMD outbreaks is making sure
vaccination campaigns have the right serotypes
included. Nevertheless, it appears from the epidemiologic comments
in the OIE WAHID posting that a policy of no vaccination and strict
depopulation was adopted as the outbreak occurred in a isolated
place. The decision to vaccinate around an outbreak versus
depopulation of all exposed animals in the area is always a critical
choice for disease control officials and should be made on the basis
of the best local, up to date information on the status of the epidemic.

As always, the wisdom of the decision is confirmed by events on the
ground over time, so we hope this is the end of the outbreak as
implied by the Guangdong Daily. However, the official OIE report is
more cautious indicating that the outbreak is continuing. Again,
let's hope there is no more spread. - Mod.PC]
