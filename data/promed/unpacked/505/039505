National Service Trainee Camp Fever May Be Airborne
---------------------------------------------------
The number of National Service (NS) trainees who
have come down with high fever at a camp in Alor
Gajah has risen to 94 and health authorities
suspect the disease is airborne. "It�s because
the speed in which it spreads is explosive � a
large number of people were infected in a matter
of days," said deputy State health director Dr
Ghazali Othman. However, he denied that the
ailment had anything to do with avian influenza,
as was feared because a chicken farm was located
next door to the Taboh Naning Camp.
"We don�t think avian influenza is the cause here
because if it is a zoonotic disease, it would not
jump from human to human so quickly and easily.
Parents should not get unduly worried," he said.
It was reported yesterday that 81 trainees had
come down with high fever since Mon [17 Apr
2006], with 25 admitted to the Malacca Hospital
since Wednesday. The number under quarantine has
now reached 69. They have "acute upper
respiratory [tract] infection" and besides fever,
they also have sore throat and coughs. Blood
samples have been sent to the Institute of
Medical Research in Kuala Lumpur and Sungai Buloh
Hospital for analysis. Ghazali said the cause of the disease was still unknown.
He was visiting the quarantined trainees at the
camp with Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Ali
Rustam, state deputy Health and Consumer Affairs
committee chairman Datuk Abu Pit and NS council
members Gan Tian Loo and Kerk Kim Hock yesterday.
Mohd Ali, meanwhile, criticised the camp�s
canteen for being "very dirty" as the floor and
tables were covered with flies. "This is
unacceptable. I want the Health Department to
fine this canteen operator. On reports that they
fell sick after drinking polluted water, he said:
"We cannot confirm anything yet. Samples have
been taken for testing � let us wait for the
report. "I understand that the people here have
been using water that has been stored in the camp
tank for over a month. Hence, the water appeared murky," he said.

The city of Malakka is located in mainland
Malaysia due south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.
The description of the ailments affecting the
National Service trainees does not resemble H5N1
avian influenza virus infection. More likely the
outbreak is the result of seasonal human
influenza virus infection, or one of the many
other upper respiratory tract pathogens affecting
humans. But until a definite diagnosis is
established the bird flu possibility must be
considered. Further information on the final
diagnosis would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
