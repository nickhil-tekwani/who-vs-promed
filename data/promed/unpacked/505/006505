Certain viruses naturally infect and cause cancer in chickens and turkeys. They include the avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses (ALSV), reticuloendotheliosis viruses, and Marek's disease virus. Some of these viruses are among the most potent cancer-causing agents known in animals [that is, avians]. Humans are widely exposed to these viruses from contact with live poultry and their raw products, including eggs; from ingestion of raw or inadequately cooked products; or through vaccination with vaccines grown in eggs, such as measles, mumps, influenza, yellow fever, and typhus vaccines. It has been shown that exogenous ALSV-contaminated yellow fever vaccines caused malignant tumors when injected into chickens. Some but not all studies have reported the presence of antibodies to these viruses in the sera of poultry workers and subjects in the general population.

A study by Felini et al. published lately in Annals of Epidemiology [Felini et al. (2011) Annals of Epidemiology 21:755-766] was designed to test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers and in the general population may be associated with increased risk of death from liver and pancreatic cancers, and also to identify new risk factors. The source population for this case-cohort study consisted of 30 411 poultry workers and 16 408 non-poultry workers.

The conclusions are that slaughtering of chickens at work and catching live chickens at work were significantly associated with pancreatic cancer. Slaughtering of chickens at work was significantly associated with liver cancer.

[The paper described above by Martin Felini and colleagues is entitled "A pilot case-cohort study of liver and pancreatic cancers in poultry workers" and was published in Annals of Epidemiology, Volume 21, Issue 10 , Pages 755-766, October 2011 http://www.annalsofepidemiology.org/article/S1047-2797 percent2811 percent2900207-9/abstract.

The purpose was to test the hypothesis that exposure to poultry oncogenic viruses that widely occurs occupationally in poultry workers and in the general population may be associated with increased risk of death from liver and pancreatic cancers, and to identify new risk factors. A pilot case-cohort study of both cancers within a combined cohort of 30 411 highly exposed poultry workers and 16 408 control subjects was conducted, and risk was assessed by logistic regression odds ratios (OR) and proportional hazards risk ratios.

New occupational findings were recorded respectively for pancreatic/liver cancers, for slaughtering of poultry (odds ratio (OR) = 8.9, 95 per cent confidence interval [CI]: 2.7-29.3)/OR = 9.1, CI: 1.9-42.9); catching of live chickens (OR = 3.6, CI: 1.2-10.9)/OR = 1.0, CI: 0.1-8.5); killing other types of animals for food (OR = 4.8, CI: 1.5-16.6)/OR = 2.0, CI: 0.2-18.2), and ever having worked on a pig raising farm (OR = 3.0, CI: 1.0-8.2) for pancreatic cancer only.

It is concluded that this study provides preliminary evidence that exposure to avian oncogenic viruses may possibly be associated with the occurrence of liver and pancreatic cancers. Case-control studies nested within occupational cohorts of highly exposed subjects of sufficient statistical power may provide an efficient and valid method of investigating/confirming these findings.

Felini et al. [In Occup Environ Med doi:10.1136/oemed-2011-100310 http://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2011/10/17/oemed-2011-100310.abstract] have also described a case-cohort study of lung cancer in poultry and control workers demonstrating that excess deaths from cancer at 11 different cancer sites including lung cancer were observed in the poultry workers.

The authors believe that these results may have important public health implications, since the general population is also exposed to these poultry viruses. Similarly elevated risks were observed for non-poultry-related occupational exposures such as working in a stockyard, working in a chemical plant, use of chemicals to kill moulds, and working in plants where plastic products were manufactured. These preliminary findings indicate that full scale epidemiological studies of adequate statistical power are needed to examine the role of occupational exposures in cancer occurrence in poultry workers.

However, it must be stressed that these analyses contain no virological component. While it is true that avian leukosis/sarcoma viruses (ALSV), reticuloendotheliosis viruses, and Marek's disease virus are potent cancer-forming agents, their oncogenic potential is restricted to avians to a large extent. It has been just over 100 years since Peyton Roux discovered Rous sarcoma virus, the 1st oncogenic virus, and it has remained a uniquely avian virus.

Nonetheless, this study is a useful attempt to identify risk factors associated with employment in the poultry industry. - Mod.CP]
