A news station in Hastings, Nebraska (KHAS) has reported that
"Stormy," a ferret and one of 4 ferrets belonging to a family of
humans sick with the flu, has died from the H1N1 virus.

According to the news report, testing was done by the University of
Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Lab, where the ferret tested positive
for H1N1. The state public health veterinarian said the event is not
unexpected but that it is rare. Only 2 ferrets in the nation have died
from H1N1, including Stormy.

A 2nd sample has been sent to a national laboratory for confirmation
of H1N1 infection [Likely that national laboratory is the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.].

Ferrets have respiratory systems similar to humans and are known to be
susceptible to human flu viruses. Infectious disease specialists do
not think dogs and cats are at risk for H1N1 infection, and there have
been no reports of dogs or cats with H1N1 infection at this writing.
Pet birds may be at risk, since the H1N1 jumped to turkeys last summer
[2009]. Caution is also advised for pet pigs.

Proper hygiene and sanitation (washing hands, bowls, tools and
clothing) and isolating sick individuals are the best defenses against
flu viruses.

It should be noted that dogs and cats have their own flu viruses,
notably the H3N8 flu virus in dogs currently in the news.

[Ferrets have many of the same clinical signs as humans with flu:
fever, lethargy, weakness, coughing and sneezing. Ferret owners need
to be particularly careful with coughing or sneezing in the direction
of the pet, as it may pass the flu to it.
