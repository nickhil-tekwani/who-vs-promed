Up to 10 270 people in Viet Nam's southern region were registered as
suffering from dengue fever between January and early May [2004], a
year-on-year rise of 48.6 percent [since 2003]. The local newspaper
"Young People" quoted sources from Ho Chi Minh City-based Pasteur
Institute as saying that 16 people died of the disease during that
period.
Most of dengue fever sufferers live in Ho Chi Minh City and the
provinces of Tien Giang, Dong Thap, Kien Giang and Bac Lieu, whose
weather is most favorable for the development of mosquitoes that are
the main transmitter of the disease.
The country detected 35 073 cases of dengue fever, including 58
fatalities, last year [2003]. To curb the spread of the disease,
centers nationwide, especially those in 20 southern localities, have
continually called for local people to use mosquito nets and keep the
environment clean.

One of the hospitals in Jeddah recently registered new cases of
dengue fever, the Arabic daily Al-Madina reported without identifying
the hospital.
Hospital sources said that in the last 2 weeks a husband and wife
afflicted with the fever were admitted to the hospital. The wife was
treated for a week until she was fully cured, while the husband went
into a coma due to a hemorrhage caused by the fever.
The sources also revealed that another dengue fever case was admitted
this week, when a female African national was suspected of the same
disease. The sources added that a few cases of people with dengue
fever were admitted to the hospital.

[These cases were most probably imported; those reported from Saudi
Arabia in 2003 -- see ref. below -- were probably confused with the
tick-borne Al Khurma virus. - Mod.JW]
