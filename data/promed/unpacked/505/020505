EPPO report on notifications of non-compliance (detection of regulated pests)

The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance
for 2004 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2005/030) from
the following countries: Belgium, Cyprus, France, Greece, Israel,
Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, United Kingdom. When a
consignment has been re-exported and the country of origin is
unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets. When the
occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).

The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance
made because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications
of non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the
report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their notifications.

Note: in the previous report (RS2005/030), it was not _Clavibacter
michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ which was found on several
consignments of potatoes but of course _C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_.
