Since the beginning of August 2011, fish have been dying in the Wolf
river in Oberwolfach. The cause is not yet clarified, and the
fishermen are completely clueless. Meanwhile, the fish kill has
extended to a length of several kilometers in the
Oberwolfach-Kirche/Oberwolfach-Walke area [south western Germany].

Initially, the event affected only grayling and trout; currently,
additional fish species are involved. The fish mortality is now
shifting further upstream.

Industrial monitoring and environmental protection are being
undertaken by the Offenburg police, who have been investigating this
event since it began. Several samples of water and fish have been
obtained and are being examined in the Chemical and Veterinary
Investigation Office in Freiburg. Fish diseases were not detected in
the samples so far; toxicological investigation is continuing.
