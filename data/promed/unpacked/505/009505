Pigs under quarantine vanish from Carroll farm
----------------------------------------------
More than 100 pigs have vanished from a farm in western Carroll
County that is under quarantine because of trichinosis. Officials
were concerned that the pigs from the Marston farm may have been
taken to slaughterhouses. "The immediate public health concern ---
especially with the history of that farm --- is that some of his pigs
have shown up with trichinosis. ... That's something you don't want
in the food chain," said Larry Leitch, the county's health officer.
The farm owner said he can't find 104 of the 105 pigs that were on
the property, according to his attorney, Roland Walker. "I don't know
who took them or where they are now," Walker said.
Officials from the state Department of Agriculture had planned to
test the pigs on the property 14 Sep [2006] but arrived to find the
gates locked, said agency spokeswoman Sue duPont. On Tuesday [26 Sep
2006], they rescheduled the visit for 4 Oct [2006], she said.
The state's quarantine was imposed in April [2006] when an emaciated
pig was discovered to be infected with trichinosis, a deadly
parasite. The quarantine forbids pigs, dead or alive, from being
brought onto or taken off the property. Yesterday, duPont said, "We
were informed that all the swine were removed by somebody." State
agriculture officials who walked the property with the owner reported
seeing only one pig on the property late yesterday afternoon, duPont
said. "We're pursuing all avenues to figure out where [the missing
pigs] are," she said.
State veterinarians have discovered that a majority of the pigs found
roaming just outside the farm have trichinosis. All pigs trapped
outside the property are being euthanized to prevent public health
risks, officials said.
Two weeks ago, the owner was charged with polluting state waterways
and illegally disposing of dead animals. He faces 4 counts of
illegally discharging a pollutant into state waters and 4 counts of
illegally allowing the disposal of solid waste on his farm, according
to the state attorney general's office. He and his son also face 19
criminal counts, including animal cruelty, feeding garbage to swine
and selling contaminated meat on the property. The charges stemmed
from raids by federal and state investigators in the spring [2006]. A
federal judge ordered the family in late July [2006] to stop selling
butchered livestock on the farm or face fines, imprisonment or the
seizure of the property.

[Let us review the history of this farm: [1] "Late April" (2006) this
farm was placed under a swine quarantine order; [2] Around the 12th
July 2006 the owner & his son were arrested on a 19-count indictment
for operating a slaughterhouse without a license, resulting from
raids on the farm in March & April 2006; [3] Between April & July
2006, 5 pigs in relation to this farm have been diagnosed with
trichinosis; [4] At some point the Maryland Department of Agriculture
scheduled to test the pigs on this farm on 14 Sep 2006, a date some 5
months after the investigation started. By then [5] the pigs had
disappeared. No comment. Res ipso loquitor. MHJ Mod]
