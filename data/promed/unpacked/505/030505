2001/056 Unusual ilarvirus of tomato found in Greece & Southern Italy
------------------------------------------------
An unusual ilarvirus of tomato, serologically related to Parietaria mottle
ilarvirus [PMoV, and causing a necrotic disease in tomato], has been
reported in Italy and [southern] France (see EPPO RS 2000/081). Symptoms
are characterized by necrotic spots on leaves, [and] corky rings and brown
patches on fruits. In Italy, it was sporadically observed in Piemonte,
Liguria, Lazio and Sardegna. Recently, this virus was also found in
symptomatic tomato plants collected from 1997-1999 in Greece [Mount Athos
(Chalkidiki Prefecture), Arethoussa and Vasilika (Thessaloniki
Prefecture)]. In Southern Italy it was sporadically detected in Campania,
Basilicata, Sicilia and Puglia.

[PMoV was also detected in tomato crops in southern France in 1999.
Symptoms of the disease in tomato are very similar to those caused by
tomato spotted wilt tospovirus and cucumber mosaic cumovirus, thus
definitive serological tests are required for correct identification of the
causal viruses. - Mod.DH]
