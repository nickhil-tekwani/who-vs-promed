Preliminary Outbreak Assessment: H7N7 avian influenza of high pathogenicity in poultry in Italy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Disease Report
--------------
The Italian Authorities have reported an outbreak of H7N7 HPAI in commercial chicken layers in Ferrara region [OIE, 2 May 2016; see 20160502.4197376]. All 17 000 birds have been humanely destroyed. Restriction zones have been put in place in line with EU rules. In addition, this month [May 2016], 2 outbreaks of LPAI have been reported in Italy; one of H5N2 LPAI in poultry breeder of various species in Pordenone region, as part of the national surveillance programme, and one of H7N7 LPAI in a holding of ornamental birds in Ferrara region, where birds were sampled as part of pre-movement testing requirements for entry at an exhibition. According to the Italian Authorities, the LPAI and HPAI H7N7 viruses are phylogenetically distinct and represent 2 separate incursions.

Situation Assessment
--------------------
In the last 2 years, there have been several outbreaks in Europe of H7N7 avian influenza of both high and low pathogenicity viruses. H7 viruses have been detected in outbreaks in poultry several times in Europe in the past few years where an incursion of LPAI has mutated to HPAI. This is more frequently detected in poultry layer farms, which may be due to a combination of the age of the birds and other risk factors arising from the nature of the production system, such as increased frequency of contact with the environment and increased indirect contact with wild birds affecting the selection pressure for mutation to HPAI. The table below documents recent H7N7 viruses in Europe. Of the 7 H7N7 LPAI outbreaks in Europe between 2015 and 2016, only one spread to another premises, where the virus subsequently mutated to HPAI following transmission within the flock. This was in Germany (https://www.fli.de/de/aktuelles/tierseuchengeschehen/klassische-gefluegelpest/). In the UK, the H7N7 HPAI outbreak was the result of an initial incursion of H7N7 LPAI and subsequent mutation within the same poultry farm (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/469948/aiepi-report-july-2015.pdf).

At present, it is not clear if the Italian HPAI case is the result of an initial incursion with an LPAI virus and consequent mutation, or initial incursion of an HPAI virus; however, the most probable explanation is that there has been an undetected incursion of LPAI H7N7 virus which has mutated to HPAI as it spread through the flock. The Italian Authorities reported very sudden onset of increased mortality and drop in egg production, which they suggest means the an HPAI incursion; however, clinical signs of LPAI viruses in poultry, even galliforme poultry, can be difficult to detect, as it relies on record keeping for food and water intake as well as production records.

According the EU Electronic Trade Notification System, TRACES, there have been no recent consignments of live poultry or hatching eggs from Italy to the UK.

Conclusion
----------
If this is a wild bird strain of H7N7 which causes HPAI infection in poultry, as opposed to a mutation from an LPAI strain to an HPAI strain in poultry, then this would be concerning and novel. However, it will be important to await full laboratory and epidemiological findings before drawing firm conclusions. It is possible there is an as yet undetected H7N7 HPAI virus circulating in poultry or captive birds elsewhere which has not caused clinical signs, in which case this reinforces the difficulties experienced with using passive surveillance only for some of these viruses and the need to enhance such systems through early reporting where signs are not suggestive of AI, therefore utilising the Testing to Exclude (TTE) scheme.

The risk level for the UK remains at low, but heightened.
