PIGEONS, UNEXPLAINED MORTALITY - USA (CALIFORNIA)

The best minds in town were trying to figure out yesterday who or what was
killing the pigeons of San Francisco. The bodies of 39 birds turned up early
yesterday in three San Francisco neighborhoods. Authorities said they were
baffled.
"One of my officers saw one pigeon literally fall from the sky," said
Captain Vicky Guldbech of the Department of Animal Care and Control. "This
is very, very odd. We've really seen nothing like this before."
A street sweeper found the first small corpse early yesterday in Maiden
Lane, feet up. "At first I thought it was shot," said sweeper Jack McGann.
"But then I found the other three, and that many dead pigeons points to
poison." Minutes later, someone else noticed 15 more pigeon corpses in Union
Square, near the stage, and called the cops. Several officers rushed to the
scene, and a captain showed up, too. Small shrouds were placed over the
bodies of the deceased.
"It's sad if someone did this," said Linda Mjellen of the Union Square
Association. "On the other hand, it's not sad to see pigeons gone."
Guldbech said there was no evidence of deliberate poisoning. She said
disease or toxic plants could be the cause.
Later in the morning, the bodies of 10 more dead pigeons turned up the
Castro district. Another 10 pigeons went feet up near 13th and Division
streets. Animal control officers found no spiked birdseed or other
suspicious substances commonly associated with pigeon poisonings. "It's
suspicious, but we really don't know anything," Guldbech said.
Downtown business interests were not mourning over the deaths. The poisoning
of a pigeon may be a crime, said Mjellen, but the death of a pigeon is no
tragedy. "Filthy, disgusting birds," she said. Poisoning pigeons, she said,
was "not among our plans of action" for the pigeons, however. The
association prefers bringing in peregrine falcons to do the job "humanely"
although the pigeons might not see
it that way.
Necropsies are scheduled for 9 a.m. today [22.4.98] at the Animal Care and
Control hospital on 15th Street.

I would hope that the necropsies would include analysis of brain
cholinesterase activity to determine if there is depression which reflects
organophosphate or carbamate exposure ... very common compounds used in lawn
care (if depression is present then analysis of upper gastrointestinal
content will provide the answer). Starlicide is another poison that could
be used but cannot be analyzed for; the tell-tail sign is severe acute renal
tubular necrosis seen histologically. The next most common toxin is that in
"rid-a-bird" perches and this can be analyzed for but you want to analyze
the feet. Other poisons are used but less commonly (such as strychnine).
If no one is seeing clinical signs in these birds, just mortality, I would
have infectious disease lower on my list. The first to look for would be
Newcastle disease which is a neurological disease with characteristic
histological changes in the brain and spinal cord and the virus can be
isolated using traditional egg inoculation procedures for virus isolation.
The other infectious agents to look for would be trichomoniasis (easy to
diagnose presumptively on gross necropsy) and potential bacterial infections
such as the salmonella infections that can hit regional bird feeders pretty
hard ... but pigeons are not the typical species of birds affected and San
Francisco has not been a primary problem spot that I know of.

[We have been looking for the official report on these deaths but seemingly
it has not been reported. When in doubt crop and proventriculus contents can
be fed to chicks as a rough-&-ready test for poisoning. In the meanwhile
this has been posted because we get a number of such reports every now &
again. For example earlier this year there was a report from the New
Orleans/Metairie area of Redwing blackbirds dying in large numbers but in a
defined area. Dressed seed will kill birds very efficiently and when not
aware of alternatives, many will think first of infectious diseases. Unless
there was information to the contrary this San Francisco incident is
characteristic of a Tom Lehrer event, "Poisoning the pigeons in the park".
But it could just as well have been a range of other seed-eating species of
birds. - Mod.MHJ]
