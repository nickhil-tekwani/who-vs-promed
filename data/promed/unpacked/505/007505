Abstract
--------
Malaria control efforts require implementation of new technologies that manage insecticide resistance. _Metarhizium pingshaense_ provides an effective, mosquito-specific delivery system for potent insect-selective toxins. A semifield trial in a MosquitoSphere (a contained, near-natural environment) in Soumousso, a region of Burkina Faso where malaria is endemic, confirmed that the expression of an insect-specific toxin (Hybrid) increased fungal lethality and the likelihood that insecticide-resistant mosquitoes would be eliminated from a site. Also, as Hybrid-expressing _M. pingshaense_ is effective at very low spore doses, its efficacy lasted longer than that of the unmodified _Metarhizium_. Deployment of transgenic _Metarhizium_ against mosquitoes could (subject to appropriate registration) be rapid, with products that could synergistically integrate with existing chemical control strategies to avert insecticide resistance.

[The study found that "The number of adults present after the F2 generation in 3 replicates with Mp-Hybrid was reduced by 91.8% to 92.7%," and the study concludes that the anopheles population collapsed in the experimental area.

It is very impressive that this fungus selectively kills anopheles mosquitoes, and the creation of this manipulated fungus is very elegant. If the results can be reproduced at a larger scale, we have a very efficient tool to end malaria transmission and control the disease.

Safety of such a potent, genetically modified fungus is a major concern, especially in times when there is a focus on an overall decline in insect populations worldwide. Perhaps a way forward to access is to search for the fungus, _Metarhizium pingshaense_, in other insects. If found, it would imply that the insect would probably also be susceptible to the toxin introduced by the hybrid fungus. - Mod.EP]
