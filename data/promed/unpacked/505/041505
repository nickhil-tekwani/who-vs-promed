Nine cases of lumpy skin disease [LSD] of cattle were confirmed in Bulgaria since 14 Apr 2016 [the number has risen in the meantime; see 20160423.4179271. - Mod.AS]. Romania has been free of LSD so far, but is now exposed to immediate, very high risk, given the evolution of the disease in the neighboring country, warns the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (ANSVSA).

The disease affects bovines (cattle and buffaloes) of all ages and causes very high economic losses, both by the disease effects themselves as well as by the control activities that are particularly expensive, entailing severe restrictions on intra and international movement of bovines, ANSVSA states in a press release sent to Agerpres on Tuesday [26 Apr 2016].

According to the Terrestrial Animal-Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), a land infected and performing eradication of LSD can regain the status of "disease free" 3 years after the confirmation and eradication of the last outbreak, which would mean serious economic losses to cattle breeders/handlers.

"While there are vaccines for this disease, they are not approved by the European Union; vaccination is not feasible for Romania at present, given that the LSD vaccine is live-attenuated, and the country that uses it is considered -- in terms of official health status -- as an infected country," reads the release.

To address this risk, ANSVSA has undertaken immediate actions, including the instruction and training of veterinarians in respect to the prescribed diagnostic and control measures, while raising the awareness of farmers and cattle breeders to LSD.

The measures that apply in case of suspected and confirmed disease are laid down in Council Directive 92/119/EEC, introducing general measures for the control of animal diseases and specific measures relating to swine vesicular disease, transposed into national law by Order ANSVSA 133/2006 [see comment].

In accordance with the aforementioned normative act, ANSVSA developed and made publicly known a Contingency Plan and an Operational Manual for local/counties and veterinary authorities in respect to viral LSD in bovines.

ANSVSA is performing further work designed to prepare actions for control in the country should it cross borders from Bulgaria.

On 21 Apr 2016, the Association of Breeders and Exporters of Cattle, Sheep & Pigs in Romania (ACEBOP) -- member of the Federation Pro-Agro -- recommended cattle breeders in Romania not to acquire animals from Bulgaria following the confirmation of new LSD outbreaks and the consequent culling there of 366 cattle [This number has risen since. - Mod.AS].

"The disease causes severe symptoms, particularly in young animals, such as anorexia, reluctance to move, followed by development of nodules on the skin, swollen lymph nodes, and their necrosis. The only applicable measure is the killing and destruction of corpses (there is a vaccine, but it is a live vaccine and not recommended)," reads the communiqu√© of ACEBOP.

To reduce the risk of disease in Romania, the association advises farmers, in addition to recommending not purchasing cattle in Bulgaria until the end of the outbreaks, to check their animals on a daily basis, to inform without delay the veterinarian about any suspected signs, to remove manure from their holdings, and to apply insecticides in spaces with garbage.

[Since the initial introduction of LSD from Turkey to Evros (on the Greek-Turkish border) in August 2015, the virus spread within Greece and invaded neighboring Bulgaria and FYR of Macedonia; see OIE's WAHIS map showing all reported outbreaks in south eastern Europe as of 25 Apr 2016 (at http://tinyurl.com/zf5tr2t; click on the south eastern European cluster, zoom in). As can be seen in the said map, 4 European countries, of which 2 are EU members, neighbor the infected countries, namely Romania, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia. The upcoming Orthodox Easter festivity and the due favorable weather conditions for the vectors might further facilitate virus spread due to increased movement between and within the countries.

Romania is the 1st to officially adopt preventive measures, as described above. The mentioned Council Directive 92/119/EEC stipulates measures applicable in the event of an outbreak of each of 10 mentioned epizootic diseases, namely rinderpest; PPR, swine vesicular disease, bluetongue, EHD, sheep pox and goat pox, vesicular stomatitis, African swine fever, lumpy skin disease, and Rift valley fever.

The reservations from preventive LSD vaccination in hitherto LSD-free countries are based upon the assumption that the introduced disease can be eradicated by the application of stamping-out policy combined with other sanitary measures including the use of insecticides or repellents. This assumption deserves to be put to discussion in view of the gathered experience in Greece and elsewhere.

One of the countries which struggled with LSD during recent years was Israel. In March 2013, general cattle vaccination was officially announced and subsequently implemented using 2 live attenuated vaccines from 2 manufacturers (details in 20130319.1594378). In view of the absence of new cases since August 2013, the Director of Israel's VSAH (Veterinary Services & Animal Health) has issued, on 14 Apr 2016, a circular to all practitioners and cattle breeders announcing the due cessation of compulsory LSD vaccination of cattle, to come into effect on 1 Jun 2016. It will be interesting to follow the LSD situation in Israel during the 2016 season and onwards. - Mod.AS
