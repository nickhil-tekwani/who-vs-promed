[1] USA: racial gap in mortality in Washington, DC
Date: Thu 21 Oct 2021

https://www.npr.org/local/305/2021/10/21/1047945733/49-out-of-the-50-people-who-died-of-c-o-v-i-d-19-in-d-c-since-june-were-black


Nearly every person who died of COVID-19 in D.C. [District of Columbia] since June [2021] was a Black resident, according to an analysis of DC Health data by DCCovid.com.

Of the 50 people who died of the virus since June, 49 were Black. Sixty percent of those deaths occurred in just 2 wards: Wards 7 and 8.

The grim numbers coincide with a dramatic rise in cases due to the delta variant and the latest peak in infections, which came on [17 Sep 2021] in the District. Case numbers generally have been trending downward since then, though the city is still facing high levels of community spread and case counts that are 11 times higher than the lowest point in the pandemic, which occurred in mid-June [2021].

The death data from the summer and early fall are yet another indicator of a tragically familiar story of severe racial disparities in healthcare access, quality of life, working conditions, and housing, resulting in a wildly unequal pandemic.

From its earliest days, the coronavirus hit Black people and neighborhoods in the District the hardest, and the pattern has not changed since.

DC Health data shows that 63 305 people in D.C. have been infected with COVID-19, as of [19 Oct 2021]. Of those, 33 119 -- just over half -- were Black, in a city where Black people make up just over 40% of the population.

The racial gap is even more stark for deaths: of the 1184 Washingtonians who have died during the pandemic, 911 of them were Black residents, or 77%.

Majority-Black Wards 7 and 8 have seen a disproportionate share of deaths. Since the beginning of June [2021], Ward 8 has accounted for 38% of deaths, while Ward 7 accounts for 22% of the total.

The vast majority -- 42 -- of the 50 deaths since June [2021] have been among unvaccinated people, according to DC Health data. Since January [2021], when the vaccine rollout began, just 12 fully vaccinated D.C. residents have died of COVID-19, compared to 214 people who were not fully vaccinated or unvaccinated.

Officials and community leaders have struggled to increase vaccination rates among Black residents in D.C., working alongside trusted messengers to correct gaps in access and address concerns about the shot and historic mistrust of the medical establishment.

"The numbers are low east of the river with the COVID-19 vaccinations because people are uncertain and afraid," D.C. resident Elvera Patrick told DCist/WAMU earlier this year [2021]. "It's been so many stories and myths about the vaccination that many don't know what's the truth."

Even with significant outreach, majority-Black Wards 7 and 8 lag noticeably behind the rest of the city in the percentage of residents 12 and older who are fully vaccinated: 44% in Ward 7 and 37% in Ward 8, compared with 64% in Ward 4 and 59% in Ward 3.

COVID-19 has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80 000 and 180 000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says.

Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs.

The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year [2021].

Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year [2022].

There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally.

"Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, 2 in 5 healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated," Dr Tedros said.

"But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."

Fewer than 1 in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with 8 in 10 in high-income countries.

A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the COVID-19 crisis could "easily drag on deep into 2022".

Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents.

The vast majority of COVID-19 vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally.

The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley.

But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies.

Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead.

He said wealthy countries needed to "stocktake" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer [2021].

"I can tell you we're not on track," he said. "We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."

The People's Vaccine -- an alliance of charities -- has released new figures suggesting just 1 in 7 of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries.

The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax.

Official figures show that earlier this year [2021] the UK received 539 370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses.

Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still "morally indefensible" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements.

The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had "kick-started" Covax last year [2020] with a donation of Â£548m [USD754 mil].

The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million.

The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines.

The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: "As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."

Covax originally aimed to deliver 2 billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year [2021], but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

[3] Brain fog
Date: Fri 22 Oct 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/brain-fog-can-persist-8-months-after-covid-diagnosis


Adult COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized or visited the emergency department (ED) at a New York City hospital still had cognitive impairments an average of 8 months after diagnosis, according to a research letter today [22 Oct 2021] in JAMA Network Open.

Researchers at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai evaluated 740 COVID-19 inpatients and outpatients using validated neuropsychologic tests in April and May 2021. Average time since COVID-19 diagnosis was 7.6 months. Participants had no history of dementia.

The aim was to better characterize the relationship between COVID-19 severity and persistent cognitive problems, often called "brain fog," because previous studies have had small sample sizes and lacked optimal measurement of cognitive function, the researchers said.

The neuropsychologic tests included Number Span forward (to gauge attention) and backward (working memory), Trail Making Test Parts A and B (processing speed and executive function, respectively), phonemic and category fluency (language), and the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (memory encoding, recall, and recognition). Executive function involves working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control.

Different impairments in inpatients, outpatients
The most prominent cognitive impairments included processing speed (133 [18%] were impaired), executive function (118 [16%]), phonemic fluency (111 [15%]), category fluency (148 [20%]), memory encoding (178 [24%], and memory recall (170 [23%]).

In analyses adjusted for race, smoking, body mass index, underlying illnesses, and depression, hospitalized patients had higher odds than outpatients of deficits in attention (odds ratio [OR], 2.8), executive function (OR, 1.8), category fluency (OR, 3.0), memory encoding (OR, 2.3), and memory recall (OR, 2.2). Patients seen in the ED were more likely than inpatients to have deficits in category fluency (OR, 1.8) and memory encoding (OR, 1.7). There were no differences in impairments in other areas.

Of all patients, 63% were women, 54% were White, 20% were Hispanic, 15% were Black, and 11% were multiracial or another race, including Asian patients (4.5%).

Deficits suggest an executive pattern
The study authors said that the relatively higher capability for memory recognition despite memory encoding and recall deficits suggests an executive pattern. "This pattern is consistent with early reports describing a dysexecutive syndrome after COVID-19 and has considerable implications for occupational, psychological, and functional outcomes," they wrote.

While older adults are especially susceptible to cognitive deficits after severe illness, the researchers noted that patients in the study were relatively young (average age, 49 years). The findings, they said, were consistent with those of cognitive and emotional studies of patients who recovered from other viral illnesses such as flu.

"The association of COVID-19 with executive functioning raises key questions regarding patients' long-term treatment," the researchers concluded. "Future studies are needed to identify the risk factors and mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction as well as options for rehabilitation."

"Discussion
In this study, we found a relatively high frequency of cognitive impairment several months after patients contracted COVID-19. Impairments in executive functioning, processing speed, category fluency, memory encoding, and recall were predominant among hospitalized patients. The relative sparing of memory recognition in the context of impaired encoding and recall suggests an executive pattern. This pattern is consistent with early reports describing a dysexecutive syndrome after COVID-19(4) and has considerable implications for occupational, psychological, and functional outcomes. It is well known that certain populations (eg, older adults) may be particularly susceptible to cognitive impairment after critical illness(5); however, in the relatively young cohort in the present study, a substantial proportion exhibited cognitive dysfunction several months after recovering from COVID-19. The findings of this study are generally consistent with those of research on other viruses (eg, influenza).(6)

Limitations of this study include a potential sampling bias, as some participants may have presented to Mount Sinai Health System because of health concerns. Future studies should investigate long-term post-COVID-19 cognitive trajectories and the association with neuroimaging findings to assess potential mechanisms."

(Executive cognitive functions are defined as, and the definition is limited to, those high-level cognitive functions that require control and direction [e.g., planning, monitoring, activating, switching, and inhibiting] of lower level, more automatic functions.)

Abstract
--------
Background: Long-term health sequelae of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are a major public health concern. However, evidence on post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (post COVID-19) is still limited, particularly for children and adolescents. Utilizing comprehensive healthcare data on more than 45 percent of the German population from January 2019 through December 2020, we investigated post COVID-19 in children/adolescents and adults.

Methods: From a total of 38 million individuals, we identified all patients with laboratory confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 through [30 Jun 2020]. A control cohort was assigned using 1:5 exact matching on age, sex, and propensity score matching on prevalent medical conditions. COVID-19 and control cohorts were followed for incident morbidity outcomes documented at least 3 months after the date of COVID-19 diagnosis, which was used as the index date for both groups. Overall, 96 pre-defined outcomes were aggregated into 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes and 3 domains (physical health, mental health, physical/mental overlap domain). We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%-confidence intervals (95%-CI).

Results: The study population included 157 134 individuals (11 950 children/adolescents and 145 184 adults) with confirmed COVID-19. COVID-19 and control cohort were well-balanced regarding covariates. For all health outcomes combined, incidence rates (IRs) in the COVID-19 cohort were significantly higher than those in the control cohort in both children/adolescents (IRR = 1.30, 95%-CI = [1.25-1.35], IR COVID-19 = 436.91, IR Control = 335.98) and adults (IRR = 1.33, 95%-CI = [1.31-1.34], IR COVID-19 = 615.82, IR Control = 464.15). The relative magnitude of increased documented morbidity was similar for the physical, mental, and physical/mental overlap domain. In the COVID-19 cohort, incidence rates were significantly higher in all 13 diagnosis/symptom complexes in adults and in 10 diagnosis/symptom complexes in children/adolescents. IRR estimates were similar for the age groups 0-11 and 12-17. Incidence rates in children/adolescents were consistently lower than those in adults. Among the specific outcomes with the highest IRR and an incidence rate of at least 1/100 person-years in the COVID-19 cohort in children and adolescents were malaise/fatigue/exhaustion (IRR = 2.28, 95%-CI = [1.71-3.06], IR COVID-19 = 12.58, IR Control = 5.51), cough (IRR = 1.74, 95%-CI = [1.48-2.04], IR COVID-19 = 36.56, IR Control = 21.06), and throat/chest pain (IRR = 1.72, 95%-CI = [1.39-2.12], IR COVID-19 = 20.01, IR Control = 11.66). In adults, these included dysgeusia (IRR = 6.69, 95%-CI = [5.88-7.60], IR COVID-19 = 12.42, IR Control = 1.86), fever (IRR = 3.33, 95%-CI = [3.01-3.68], IR COVID-19 = 11.53, IR Control = 3.46), and dyspnea (IRR = 2.88, 95%-CI = [2.74-3.02], IR COVID-19 = 43.91, IR Control = 15.27). Conclusions: This large, matched cohort study indicates substantial new-onset post COVID-19 morbidity in pediatric and adult populations based on routine health care documentation. Further investigation is required to assess the persistence and long-term health impact of post COVID-19 conditions, especially in children and adolescents.

Conclusions. We found that COVIDâ19 diagnosis was associated with higher longâterm demand for healthcare services as reflected in outpatient and inpatient diagnoses of a broad set of outcomes more than 3 months after detection of SARSâCoVâ2 infection. While children and adolescents appear to be less affected than adults, these findings are statistically significant for all age groups. In children and adolescents, the incidence rate ratio of documented newâonset mental health problems during followâup was higher compared to adults, whereas the opposite was true for documented health outcomes of the pulmonary diagnosis/symptom complex. To the extent that these results reflect a higher longârun morbidity related to SARSâCoV-2 infections, they may indicate an important public health challenge that should be considered in discussions about adequate preventive measures. Of course, these discussions must also consider harmful side effects of preventive measures [26]. In summary, our findings demonstrate that post COVID-19 cannot be dismissed among children and adolescents. Controlled populationâbased studies and further indepth analyses are required to confirm results among children and adolescents and their impact for individuals and health care systems. Future analyses need to include currently unavailable, more recent data for extended followup of individuals with post COVID-19 condition identified in the present study and to get further insight into risk and protective factors. As more recent data become available it will also be possible to assess the persistence of the COVIDâ19ârelated documented morbidity during later phases of the pandemic.

[These are important findings as they are "the first that suggests relevant post COVIDâ19 healthcare utilization and new onset morbidity patterns documented by physicians in children and adolescents following COVIDâ19 disease in a large sample of patients with confirmed COVIDâ19 compared to a matched control group...." (They) demonstrate long term sequelae "across all outcome domains (physical/mental/overlap) in both [younger and older] age groups and for all diagnosis/symptom complexes in adults and most diagnosis/ symptom complexes in children and adolescents. These results suggest that longâterm sequelae of COVIDâ19 may play a role in both younger and older age groups." - Mod.LK]
