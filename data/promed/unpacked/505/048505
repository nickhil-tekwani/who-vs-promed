A terrifying disease spread by mosquitos is sweeping across Europe killing at least 170 people in Europe this year [2018], with the majority of cases in the south of the continent as infection rates soar.

Last year [2017], there were only 200 reported infections in the EU, with 25 people killed. But in 2018 there have been 1460 reported cases of the potentially lethal sickness, according to the EU Health Commission.

The fever has ripped across Europe in 2018, killing 44 people in Italy, 42 in Greece, 42 in Romania, and 35 in Serbia.

Fatalities in Kosovo (3), Bulgaria (2), the Czech Republic (1), and Hungary (1) have also occurred. Italy (550) and Serbia (410) have seen the highest number of cases.

Victims contract the virus from mosquitos that have fed on infected birds. Around 80 per cent of infected people have no symptoms, with about a fifth of those affected developing flu-like symptoms.

Roughly one in 150 people get seriously ill with a high fever and meningitis.

Cold weather is helping to reduce the killer virus's impact. So far, nobody has caught the virus while in the UK.

But with no vaccine to protect holidaymakers from West Nile virus, the NHS has warned British travellers to wear mosquito spray and use mosquito nets in affected countries.

Birds are the most common carriers and can spread the West Nile fever between countries when they migrate.
In September [2018], a German vet was diagnosed with suspected West Nile virus infection after performing an autopsy on a dead owl found in a wildlife park. The fever is not spread directly between animals.

By 30 Oct 2018, EU Member States reported 1463 cases in Italy (550), Greece (307), Romania (276), Hungary (214), Croatia (53), France (24), Austria (19), Bulgaria (15), Slovenia (3), and the Czech Republic (2).

It was first detected in 1937 in the West Nile region of Uganda. In the 1990s, it made the leap across the Atlantic with the US hit by an epidemic of more than 4000 sufferers and 250 deaths in 2002.

The spread of West Nile, a virus carried by mosquitoes that has claimed 44 lives since appearing in May [2018], is on the wane, according to the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO), with no new infections being reported in the last week.

Since its outbreak in the spring, 312 people have been infected by West Nile, making 2018 Greece's worst year for the virus on record.

The unusually high autumn temperatures, meanwhile, have prompted authorities across Greece to extend their mosquito-prevention programs. The Attica Regional Authority plans on [Mon 5 Nov 2018] to spray grassy areas, streams and riverbeds in the northern suburbs, focusing on leafy areas like Maroussi and Vrilissia and then moving up to Kifissia, Pefki, and other parts over the course of the week.

In the past 5 days, between 26 and 30 Oct 2018, EU Member States reported 3 human West Nile virus (WNV) infections in Hungary (2) and Bulgaria (1). EU neighbouring countries reported 12 cases, all by Serbia. No deaths were reported.

All human cases were reported from areas that have been affected during previous transmission seasons.

In the past 5 days, 6 outbreaks among equids were reported by Italy (3), Hungary (2), and Spain (1).

In 2018, as of 30 October 2018, EU Member States have reported 1 463 human cases in Italy (550), Greece (307), Romania (276), Hungary (214), Croatia (53), France (24), Austria (19), Bulgaria (15), Slovenia (3) and the Czech Republic (2). EU neighbouring countries reported 534 human cases in Serbia (410), Israel (110) and Kosovo* (14). To date, 170 deaths due to West Nile virus infection have been reported by Italy (44), Greece (42), Romania (42), Serbia (35), Kosovo* (3), Bulgaria (2), the Czech Republic (1), and Hungary (1).

In September 2018, a veterinarian was diagnosed with suspected WNV infection after performing an autopsy on a deceased owl found in a wildlife park near Poing, Ebersberg, Bavaria, Germany. WNV was detected in the owl by PCR in tissue samples recovered during the autopsy.

During the current transmission season [2018], 267 outbreaks among equids have been reported by Italy (139), Hungary (89), Greece (15), France (11), Spain (6), Romania (2), Germany (2), Austria (1), Slovenia (1), and Portugal (1).

In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should be deferred for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of West Nile virus circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative.

[Environmental changes have impacted not only the spread of vector borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile to regions and countries that had none or very few cases. Prevalence rates have also gone up, thereby requiring review of the public health response capacity and planning. - Mod.UBA]
