[With the addition of these 7 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections and 6 deaths, this brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals in Saudi Arabia to 480, including 139 deaths. The 6 newly reported deaths include one of the newly confirmed infections and 5 previously reported laboratory-confirmed infections. Four of the newly confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals had a history of contact with a previously confirmed case, and 2 of these were asymptomatic and were identified through contact screening; the other 2 had respiratory symptoms and are reported to be in stable condition. Three of the reported fatalities today were under age 40. No mention of history of pre-existing co-morbidities was made, nor was the possible location of transmission of the MERS-CoV.

[2] Jordan, 1 new case - media report

Jordan announced that it has registered a 9th coronavirus infection [in] a male nurse in his 50s who works at a private hospital and was one of a cadre that was treating an infected person at the hospital.

The health ministry said the new case was under an epidemiological investigation the ministry started for persons who dealt with infected people, adding that the man was in a stable condition.

The total number of cases registered in the Kingdom since reporting the 1st case in 2012 rises to 9; 4 of them died.

[It appears as though the single case of MERS-CoV infection in a Saudi national who sought medical treatment in Jordan has now resulted in 2-3 additional cases in healthcare workers [HCWs] in Jordan. One of the HCWs did not give a history of direct contact with a known MERS-CoV infected individual, but as a respiratory therapist there is a high probability this individual was infected through contact with a MERS-CoV infected individual requiring respiratory therapy. More information on the results of epidemiologic investigations surrounding this case would be greatly appreciated.

With the addition of this newly confirmed case in Jordan, and the 7 newly confirmed cases and 6 deaths in Saudi Arabia, if this moderator's calculations are correct, this will bring the global tally of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections to 569 cases, including 165 deaths.

[3] Saudi Arabia, Indonesian pilgrim(s) - media report

2nd Indonesian found with MERS in Saudi Arabia
----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian citizen in Saudi Arabia has been diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus.

According to a press release from the Indonesia Consulate General in Jeddah, [an 84-year-old-male] had arrived in Saudi Arabia to go on umrah (minor haj pilgrimage) on [15 Apr 2014], and was scheduled to return to Indonesia on [25 Apr 2014], as reported by tribunnews.com.

[This 84-year-old male] from Makassar, South Sulawesi, was admitted into the King Fahd Specialist Hospital on [28 Apr 2014] complaining of chest pains.

On [29 Apr 2014], the Health Ministry reported that another Indonesian -- [a 61-year-old] -- had died of MERS after being treated for 7 days at King Saud Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

"The patient [the 84-year-old] tested positive for the MERS virus and is currently undergoing treatment in an isolation room at the King Fahd hospital in Jeddah," Syarif Shahabudin of the Indonesia Consulate said.

MERS symptoms are similar to flu, such as fever and respiratory problems.

Syarif said that the doctors caring for [the 84-year-old] said that his condition was showing good progress.

He added that [the 84-year-old male's] companion, who is currently waiting in Jeddah, would also be examined for the MERS virus even though he seemed to be in good health.

"The consulate will continue to monitor this situation closely and coordinate with hospitals and other relevant parties," Syarif said.

Since its 1st appearance in 2012, the MERS virus has infected around 463 people and killed 126 of them.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has yet to impose a travel restriction on those wishing to travel to the Middle East. However, the Saudi Arabia authorities have issued warnings for those who would be vulnerable to the virus, such as the elderly, children, pregnant women and those suffering from chronic diseases. [See MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (43): UAE, WHO, Saudi Haj recs. 20130714.1823927 for a discussion on the Haj recommendations.]

[If this moderator understands the above media report correctly, this is a report of an individual from Indonesia travelling to Saudi Arabia as a pilgrim for a 10-day visit who is ill as a result of MERS-CoV infection. What is not mentioned in the media report are possible exposures of this individual.... Had this individual sought health care services for another reason prior to onset of MERS-CoV consistent illness where the exposure may have been in the health care environment? Had this individual visited a farm, spent time around animals such as camels; had this individual consumed raw animal products such as milk or meat? Had this individual had contact with known MERS-CoV infected individuals? Individuals spending short periods of time in the Middle East who develop MERS-CoV infections could be excellent sources of information for identifying what may be the high risk exposures.

This situation also points out the challenges of having public health recommendations that are aimed at "self exclusion." In principle this individual should have self excluded from visiting the Middle East at this time according to recommendations of the Saudi MOH last year (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (43): UAE, WHO, Saudi Haj recs. 20130714.1823927). - Mod.MPP]
