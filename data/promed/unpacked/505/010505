In a follow-up on the legionnaires' disease cluster in the Highbridge area of the Bronx [a borough of New York City], the New York City Health Department reports the cluster is over and the investigation is closed. No new cases of legionnaires' disease have been identified in residents of the area with symptom onset in the past 4 weeks. There were 30 cases of legionnaires' disease associated with this cluster. 28 people were hospitalized, 24 have been discharged, and 2 died.

After extensive epidemiologic investigation, sampling of area cooling towers, and molecular analysis [genotyping] of legionella bacteria from human and cooling tower specimens, the Health Department's Public Health Laboratory and epidemiologists have matched the legionella strain found in the cooling tower located at 1325 Jerome Ave, 10452 with the strain found in 2 patients from the Highbridge cluster. The Health Department sampled that cooling tower on the day the investigation began on 20 May 2022. The building owner was ordered to immediately disinfect on 23 May 2022 and perform additional remediation on 3 Jun 2022. The building has complied and is working with the Health Department on its long-term management program.

"Thank you to the dozens of elected officials and community leaders who worked with the Department to inform residents in the area about proper precautions," said health commissioner Dr Ashwin Vasan. "The Department's investigation was able to identify one cooling tower that had a genetic match with patient specimens, and the cooling tower was ordered to take additional cleaning and disinfection measures."

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by legionella bacteria, which grow in warm water. Symptoms resemble other types of pneumonia and can include fever, chills, muscle aches, and cough. Most cases of legionnaires' disease can be traced to contamination of artificial water systems where conditions are favorable for legionella growth, such as cooling towers.

People get sick by breathing in water vapor containing legionella bacteria -- it is not transmitted from person to person. Legionnaires' disease is not caused by drinking from water that has legionella bacteria [see moderator comments below]. Individuals at higher risk include those ages 50 and over, cigarette smokers, and people with chronic lung disease or compromised immune systems.

[Highbridge (population 37 727 residents in 2010) is a residential neighborhood in the New York City borough of the Bronx, located between the Cross-Bronx Expressway (I-95) to the north, Jerome Avenue to the east, Macombs Dam Bridge to the south, and the Harlem River to the west (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highbridge,_Bronx). A map showing the location of Highbridge can be seen at https://goo.gl/maps/GqQZ2VZRSWsWbvQx8. Yankee Stadium is on its south east boundary. The location of the incriminated cooling tower at 1325 Jerome Ave, which had a strain of legionella with the same genotype as that of the strain isolated found in 2 patients in the Highbridge cluster, is shown on a map found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/1325+Jerome+Ave,+The+Bronx,+NY+10452.

When ProMED last posted (5 Jun 2022) on this outbreak of the legionnaires' disease in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx, New York City, there were 24 cases with 2 dead; now there are 30 cases, but no additional deaths. Remediation of the incriminated cooling tower was completed on 3 Jun 2022 and no additional cases have occurred with symptom onset in the past 4 weeks, that is, beyond the incubation period of legionnaires' disease of up to 2 weeks. Consequently, the New York City Health Department closed the investigation.

However, we have not been told about genotyping of isolates from the other 28 cases, but perhaps their diagnoses may have been based on positive urinary antigen testing, with no isolates available for genotyping.

Legionella are common in natural water sources such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, but usually in low numbers. Humans acquire legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually through inhalation of aerosolized legionella bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of legionella-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease has also been described by Correia and colleagues (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). Legionella infection can be acquired, less commonly, by contamination of wounds.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a legionella-contaminated plumbing systems by showerheads, sink faucets, misters, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, car-wash facilities, as well as a building's cooling towers (structures that contain water and a fan as part of centralized air cooling systems), and even wastewater treatment plants. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C (77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of legionella from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of legionella within several species of protozoa, where legionella replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of legionella to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _L. pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems -- usually done by culture -- would miss VBNC legionella, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249). - Mod.ML
