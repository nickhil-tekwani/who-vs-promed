UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE - ETHIOPIA (SOUTH)

The Ethiopian private newspaper 'Ethiop' has reported that people in
different locations throughout Ethiopia are dying of an unknown contagious
disease.
This disease began killing people long ago particularly in the southern
region, and northern and southern Omo and Gurage regions. The newspaper also
noted that at least 5 people are dying every day in one area.
Since an increasing number of people are dying and burial places in churches
are already full, residents of various areas 30 to 40 km from Addis Ababa
are giving small portions of their land for burial, the newspaper reports.
It should be recalled that the Weyane [Ethiopian] radio itself reported in
its radio broadcasts that schools in Addis Alem town are likely to be closed
because many of the teachers and students are infected by the disease.
