An investigation into the cause of a summer fish kill on the St.
Joseph River near Elkhart and Mishawaka has concluded the cause was a
combination of fish pathogens. "Our test results show pathogens, and
not pollution, were the primary cause of death for several hundred
common carp," said Bill James, chief of fisheries for the Department
of Natural Resources.

The fish die-off, which occurred in July and August 2011, triggered a
joint investigation by the DNR, the State Board of Animal Health
(BOAH), and the Elkhart County Health Department. The Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory at Purdue University tested tissue samples and
found that in addition to bacterial and parasite issues, the carp were
suffering the effects of a pathogen known as koi herpes virus (KHv).

Unusually warm weather also is believed to be a contributing factor.
"The carp that died were pushed beyond their normal defense limits by
rapidly rising water temperatures, bacteria, parasites, and ultimately
the koi herpes virus," James said.

Indiana State Veterinarian Dr. Bret D. Marsh said: "The pathogens
involved in this case are specific to selected species of fish and are
not an imminent health threat to other fish in the river, neither are
they a source of health problems in people if fish taken from the
river are eaten." Marsh added that the koi herpes virus was not
identified previously in Indiana waters but was found in many of the
fish collected in this case.

The investigation shows the dynamic nature of life in rivers and the
uncertainty for stable and apparently healthy fish populations. KHv is
on the world watch list because it is known to cause significant
losses in wild populations and captive environments where specially
bred carp, commonly referred to as koi, are used in the aquarium
industry.

The bacteria and parasite identified are common in the aquatic
environment and by themselves normally don't cause fish die-offs.
However, when fish are stressed heavily by a virus, such as KHv, these
other common pathogens can contribute to losses. The new Great Lakes
fish virus disease -- viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) -- was not
detected.

James said the situation is a reminder to boaters, anglers and other
watercraft users that they can play an important role in preventing
the spread of unwanted organisms from one body of water to another.
The DNR advises boaters and anglers to clean, drain and dry all
equipment when moving from one waterway to another and to only release
fish into the body of water from which they came.

[The above report is a word for word repeat of the DNR news release of

(http://www.in.gov/activecalendar/EventList.aspx?view=EventDetails&eventidn=39387&information_id=78944&type=&syndicate=syndicate),
which did not define the common aquatic "bacteria and parasites"
identified besides the koi herpes virus, which is a pity.
