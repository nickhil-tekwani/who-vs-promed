The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health [Hong Kong SAR] is today [26 Nov 2012] conducting a joint investigation with the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) into a suspected outbreak of respiratory disease involving 5 AFCD staff working in the New Territories North Animal Management Centre (NTNAMC) in Sheung Shui. They were all males aged between 27 and 64 with onset of symptoms from [6-24 Nov 2012].

The 1st case affected a 64-year-old man who presented with upper respiratory symptoms since [6 Nov 2012].

He was admitted to a hospital in Australia since [12 Nov 2012].

The 2nd case is a 55-year-old man. He developed chills, cough and sore throat since November 8 and fever, shortness of breath, headache and myalgia since [19 Nov 2012].

He was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital (QMH) on [22 Nov 2012. His] chest X-ray showed bilateral upper zone patchiness and the clinical diagnosis was pneumonia. He is now receiving care in the Intensive Care Unit of QMH in stable condition.

Respiratory and urine specimens taken from the 55-year-old patient at QMH tested by the hospital yielded negative results for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Legionnaires' Disease, while test results for psittacosis and leptospirosis are pending. CHP's Public Health Laboratory Centre performed tests on the patient's respiratory specimens and it was negative for Novel Coronavirus associated with Severe Respiratory Disease.

The 3rd case affected a 62-year-old man who developed bilateral red eyes on [12 Nov 2012], and was admitted to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital on [17 Nov 2012] because of cough with blood-stained sputum, malaise, chills, rigors and sore throat. His condition was stable.

The diagnosis was pneumonia. Preliminary laboratory testing for influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, RSV and adenovirus was negative.

The 4th case is a 27-year-old man. He developed fever, headache and malaise on [14 Nov 2012] and was admitted to Yan Chai Hospital on [18 Nov 2012].

The diagnosis was pneumonia. He recovered after treatment and was discharged home on [22 Nov 2012] and his condition was stable.

The 5th case affected a 62-year old man who presented with cough, chills and rigor since [24 Nov 2012] and was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for further management on [26 Nov 2012].

His condition is stable.

The home contacts of the patients are asymptomatic.

CHP staff conducted a site visit to NTNAMC today and provided health advice to the staff.

According to the information provided by AFCD, there is a batch of 16 seized parrots being kept in NTNAMC since [20 Oct 2012].

Subsequently 3 died and 10 were euthanised as precautionary measures. The health condition of the 3 surviving birds is being closely monitored.

The possibility of psittacosis outbreak among these staff is being actively investigated.

The investigation is underway.

[With the current attention focused on heightened surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) worldwide, outbreaks of undiagnosed SARIs are being investigated and tested for the novel coronavirus identified in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. As noted above, testing for key known viral agents associated with SARI have been completed and were negative. The work locations of all 5 cases--all are staff working in an animal management center where 16 parrots were seized and under observation--and the history that 3 of the parrots had died raises the suspicion of psittacosis as the possible etiology of this outbreak.

Borrowing from Mod.LL's comment in Psittacosis - UK: (Scotland) susp. 20120315.1070385:

"Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

"The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

"People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

"Historically (http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Swine-Rabbits/DISEASES-AND-PARASITES-AFFECTING-poultry/Ornithosis-and-Psittacosis.html), the 1st description of a disease marked by an atypical pneumonia was reported in 1879 among persons having contact with sick parrots. A severe and sometimes fatal atypical pneumonia was observed in various European countries and the USA in later years. An unusually severe epidemic occurred in Paris in 1892. The name psittacosis was suggested for the disease in 1895.

"An epidemic involving more than 100 cases of atypical pneumonia, diagnosed as psittacosis, occurred in Argentina in 1929. A year later, outbreaks in Europe and the USA were traced to parrots newly imported from South America."

More information on this outbreak would be greatly appreciated, including results of laboratory studies on the human cases as well as the parrots.
