Launching of the Blueprint for canine rabies elimination and human
rabies prevention
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rabies continues to be an active threat in many countries throughout
the world, as regularly reported on ProMED. In an effort to help
countries find and implement realistic solutions to reduce the burden
of rabies throughout their territory, the Global Alliance for Rabies
Control, Partners for Rabies Prevention and FAO's Regional Central
Animal Health in Bamako, under the coordination of Dr Tiziana Lembo,
are launching a new on-line "Blueprint for canine rabies elimination
and human rabies prevention," accessible at
<http://www.rabiesblueprint.com/>.

This Blueprint brings together recommendations from WHO, OIE, FAO,
academic institutions, animal welfare organizations, vaccine
producers and other global stakeholders involved in rabies control as
well as published data from the field, and case reports for closer
examination of how human rabies can be prevented and canine rabies
can be eliminated. It is not meant to replace existing material or
national guidelines but rather to serve as an easy-to-use guide and a
one-stop website where national stakeholders can find up-to-date
normative and practical information on how to prevent and control rabies.

The information is available in both English and French and we hope
to have additional languages to increase the website's usage in other
countries. More chapters addressing wildlife rabies control will soon
be added. We invite everyone involved in rabies control throughout
the world to utilize the Blueprint and look forward to comments and
feedback on how we may improve the website.

[We welcome the "Blueprint for Rabies' initiative and encourage
subscribers to access this user-friendly site and to make use of its
updated information and interactive system. Applying the search tool,
69 articles have been found for the term "oral vaccination dogs."

Another example of the broad spectrum and transparent approach of
this site: when searching for 'population control,' the site
provides, among others, direct links to pdf copies of 3 available
guidelines: WSPA's 'Methods for the euthanasia of dogs and cats:
comparison and recommendations,' EU Commission's 'Recommendations for
euthanasia of experimental animals' (2 parts), and OIE's 'Stray dog
population control.'

Rabies in man and animal has been one of ProMED-mail's main issues
since its inception in 1994; 1101 postings are currently available on
the search archives. - Mod.AS]
