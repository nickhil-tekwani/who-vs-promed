On [22 Jun 2014] classical swine fever was detected on a farm in Dagda municipality (southeastern Latvia), reports LETA/Nozare.lv.

The Food and Veterinary Service representative Anna Joffe informed the business portal Nozare.lv that 3 cases of swine fever in wild boar had been registered in the region so far this year [2014]. Wild boar in this region have been regularly vaccinated against swine fever since 2013.

A total of 8 pigs were culled and cremated on the farm; disinfection has been carried out as well.

On [26 Nov 2012], swine fever was ascertained on 3 farms in Latgale [region in eastern Latvia]; 14 infected pigs were killed and disinfection was carried out, and the pig owners received compensation. No new cases of swine fever have been registered on Latvian farms since. In 2013, laboratory tests established 46 cases of swine fever in wild boars.

[Thanks to Sabine Zentis for the information provided.

According to the OIE follow-up report no 10, 2 new outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF) were reported. One occurred in the Baltinava municipality where a wild boar was identified as CSF-infected, and the other (mentioned above by the media) occurred in Dagda municipality where 3 pigs in a backyard farm tested positive.

The epidemiological comments noted that on 21 Jun 2014, a veterinarian notified the local authorities of the suspicion of CSF in a backyard farm. On [22 Jun 2014] the disease was confirmed in domestic pigs by the National Reference Laboratory. All suspect animals were destroyed that same day and protection and surveillance zones were established. The backyard farm is located within the current CSF-infected area, about 15 km (9.3 mi) from the Belarus border. Hunting and sampling of wild boar is still ongoing.

Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s) has been applied:
Administrative division / Species / total vaccinated / Detail
Latvia / wild boar / 6000 / since May 2013 wild boar oral vaccination against CSF virus is ongoing in the CSF infected area.
See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=15475

Since the event started in October 2012, 116 outbreaks of CSF have been reported in wild boar and swine. An updated report and map is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015475_20140625_155427.pdf.

On 26 Jun 2014, for the 1st time and despite biosecurity measures in place after the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in Belarus and Russia in 2013 (see ProMED-mail posting 20140321.2345369), Latvia also reported African swine fever (ASF). One of the ASF cases in Latvia also occurred in the Dagda region. For more information please see ProMED mail posting 20140626.2568442. - Mod.CRD

It would be interesting to know more about the oral vaccination of wild boar. Does the figure of 6000 mean that 6000 baits were distributed, assuming 100 percent uptake? Or that the local population of wild boar was estimated at 6000 and excess bait was distributed to hopefully cover it? - Mod.JW
