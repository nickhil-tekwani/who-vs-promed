3. Using an online dashboard tool, post relevant reports of events of interest in human/animal health to the South Asia region with appropriate commentary in a timely manner (less than 24 hours). Reports should include short, knowledgeable, appropriate contextual commentaries with background information.

Inter- and Intra- staff:

8. Attend periodic meetings (annual or biannual) of ProMED staff.
9. Report to the ProMED-mail Project Manager and Deputy Editor an informal monthly report, and a formal quarterly report of your activities, specifying the number of outbreak items you've found in your region; the number of ProMED-SoAs messages you moderated; and the number of invitations to join ProMED-SoAs you forwarded to relevant individuals or lists; plus any other information you believe to be of interest to ProMED-SoAs.
10. Set a regular schedule with the Regional Moderator and ProMED Deputy Editor and notify him/her in advance of any expected absence from moderation duties.
11. Contact the Regional Moderator with any questions or suggestions for improving ProMED-SoAs.

Qualifications:
1. An advanced degree in the human/animal health field required (MD, MBBS, DVM, PhD in microbiology or similar field), additional advanced degree in a related field preferred (MPH or participation in an international Field Epidemiology Training Program) a plus.
2. Five or more years of experience in human or animal infectious diseases, specifically in diagnosis, treatment, and/or research.
3. A track record of achievement in academic, governmental, or nongovernmental organization commensurate with career stage.
4. Ability and interest in maintaining expertise in infectious diseases through continuing education.
5. Email and World Wide Web proficiency and daily access.
