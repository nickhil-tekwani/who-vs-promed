Severe respiratory disease associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 21st update, 21 Oct 2015

Main conclusions and options for response
---------------------------------
The majority of the MERS cases continue to be reported from the Middle East.

Given the continuous occurrence of MERS cases in the Middle East and the substantial number of people travelling between the region and EU countries, sporadic importation of MERS cases to EU/EEA Member States can be expected. The last reported MERS case in Europe was in Germany in March 2015.

The most recent outbreak in Jordan is not unexpected, although it is of concern. The majority of the reported cases have an exposure history involving a hospital with an admitted confirmed MERS case. The role of hospitals as amplifiers of MERS-CoV infection is now well known.

The outbreak in Jordan is centered on hospitals in Amman. The importation of cases to EU/EEA Member States from Jordan is considered low.

WHO does not recommend travel restrictions in relation to MERS-CoV but rather recommends raising awareness among travellers to and from affected countries. EU citizens travelling to Middle Eastern countries need to be made aware that MERS-CoV is currently circulating in the region and that transmission in hospital settings is still one of the main sources of infection.

EU citizens should also be reminded that the risk of infection can be reduced by taking simple infection prevention measures.

Should someone infected with MERS-CoV enter Europe, they are likely to present themselves to a healthcare facility. The risk of nosocomial spread highlights the need for awareness among healthcare workers, stringent infection control precautions, early detection through functioning testing algorithms, and preparedness planning.

The risk of widespread transmission of MERS-CoV in the community after sporadic importation into the EU/EEA remains low. Previously issued advice for travellers, including pilgrims, and healthcare workers remains valid.

[See ProMED-mail "MERS-CoV (144): Saudi Arabia, 2 new cases, Nora Univ no student cases 20151018.3724154." The implication of these asymptomatic cases for transmission is unknown.

From Michael Coston [editor] Avian Flu Diary (http://afludiary.blogspot.com/) no. 10 641: 11 days ago, the Saudi MOH announced the 1st of what has now grown to be 7 MERS cases linked to a household of 36 female expat workers, all living together in a 3-room apartment in Riyadh. According to the MOH, these women worked for a private contractor providing janitorial services to Princess Nora University, and no students are involved.

The "Probable Source Of Infection" was listed as "under review" for the 1st 2 cases, as "household contact" for the 2nd 2 cases, and as "secondary household contact" for the 3 latest cases.

A map of Saudi Arabia showing the location of the cases reported today (21 Oct 2015) is available at the source URL above. - Mod.LK
