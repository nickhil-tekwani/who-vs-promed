Hundreds of thousands of wild birds have died in recent months in an unprecedented outbreak of avian influenza in Europe, North America, and elsewhere in the world. The wave of infections probably began in northern Europe around January [2022], and now experts and researchers are expressing concern that this outbreak will prove to be a turning point in the survival ability of certain species and in the biodiversity of the world's birds.

"We are facing an event of mass extinction of animals, entire populations are affected by this virus," says the deputy chief scientist of the Nature and Parks Authority, Uri Naveh. "This is not something we have seen before," adds Prof Ran Natan, of the movement's ecology laboratory at the Hebrew University. "In many thousands", says Natan, referring to the extent of mortality in Israel, "I am afraid that this number will double in a short time."

The H5N1 bird flu virus has been known to scientists and farmers since 1996, when it first broke out in China. Researchers know how to pinpoint the place where the plague began -- a goose farm in Guangdong Province. Since then, various variants of the virus have erupted from time to time in chicken coops and breeding farms around the world.

In 2016, an outbreak was also documented for the first time among wild birds, but it was limited in scope. According to experts, wild birds have always played a role in transmitting the virus from place to place but have usually not suffered from high mortality from it. This all began to change last year [2021], when reports began to arrive of abnormal mortality of wild birds living in flocks in Europe and Africa.

The deadly virus arrived in Israel at the beginning of winter [2021-22]. The largest eruption was in the Hula Reserve, where tens of thousands of cranes crowded. More than 8000 cranes and hundreds of other bird species died in the reserve. The JNF [Jewish National Fund], which manages the site, closed the reserve, and the Ministry of Agriculture, under the supervision of the National Security Headquarters, carried out extensive operations to evacuate the carcasses and clean up the area.

Following the incident, it was also decided to change the feeding policy of the cranes, which was intended to prevent them from roaming the agricultural fields but caused their overcrowding and allegedly aided the spread of the virus. At the same time, the Ministry of Agriculture destroyed more than a million poultry in chicken coops infected with the virus. Contrary to fears, no outbreak was recorded during the recent spring migration in Israel, but in recent weeks a frightening picture has become clear about the spread of the virus around the world.

Reports from many countries indicate that the disease is spreading both on farms and in the wild, among feral birds and especially waterfowl in Europe and North America. In some cases, the disease has caused such a severe mortality that it threatens the extinction of species that are already on the verge of extinction. One of them is the Dalmatian pelican, which spends the summer in northern Greece and is in danger of extinction. It is estimated that there are about 8000 individuals of this species in the world, and it is possible that up to half of them have died from the recent flu [20220322.8702159].

Naveh, from the science division of the Nature and Parks Authority, says it could be a death blow to the entire species: "Surviving individuals will produce fewer offspring, which in turn are threatened by anthropogenic actions such as poisoning, shooting, drying up habitats, high voltage lines and expelling fishponds that were once swamps. A bottleneck may be created here that the species will not be able to escape," he warns.

In Scotland the disease has struck the northern gannet, one of the most impressive and beautiful seabirds in the world. The disease has affected the largest nesting colony of the species and so far, there have been hundreds of carcasses. "We are helpless, all we have been left to do is watch and monitor the spread of the disease through the colony," Susan Davis, of the Scottish Seabird Center, told the BBC.

Earlier, at the start of the January wave of morbidity, the disease also affected barnacle goose [Branta leucopsis], a species of goose in Scotland [20220106.8700696]. In Southern Africa, the virus has affected a local population of cormorants [20220128.8701122]. The virus was most likely transmitted to the United States by a Heuglin's gull that crossed the Atlantic Ocean. The disease spread to almost every US state and killed dozens of bald eagles, the national bird of the United States [20220518.8703337]. The official number of the World Organization for Animal Health stands at 383 000 wild birds that have died from the disease, but the real numbers are probably much higher, as many birds have died in water or in remote places. In addition, as part of the fight against the disease, tens of millions of birds, especially ducks, geese, and turkeys, died or have been killed. In the United States alone, about 40 million birds have been exterminated in the current wave.

The disease is not limited to birds. In Europe, cases in predators, mainly foxes and skunks, have been detected, which apparently preyed on infected birds. There have also been cases of infection in humans in the past, but these are rare, as the virus hardly attacks humans in its current form. Until now, anyone infected with the virus were coop workers or people who lived in close proximity to infected birds. When a person is infected, the mortality rate is very high and reaches more than 50%.

Experts explain that the current wave of morbidity is characterized by 3 anomalies compared to previous waves. It is longer, more geographically extensive and harms wild birds in much larger numbers. "There have been eruptions in the past, but I do not remember such a rolling event, both in terms of time span and in terms of geographical space," says the ornithologist Dr Yoav Perlman, Society for the Protection of Nature.

Part of the explanation for this may be the climate crisis. "The winter in Europe is not as harsh as it used to be, the water in the lakes does not freeze and the viruses in the water survive more easily. When looking to the future the forecast is that these eruptions will intensify," Perlman adds. "The fear is that this effect will pass over the summer," adds Dr Motti Charter of the Haifa University.

A slightly different position is presented by Dr Nati Elkin, a poultry veterinarian, who maintains a site that collects information about the plague [https://www.poultrymed.com/]. Elkin is relatively optimistic about the current wave, as he says the plague is already in decline in Europe and the US and as the weather warms it is likely to disappear next winter.

Naveh explains that the virus joins other human threats to wild birds, and for some it may be the straw that will break their backs. "The prevailing explanation today is that what killed the dinosaurs was not the meteor explosion but the change of the environment. It weakens the animal's defense systems, immune system and feeding sites. Some species are unable to cope with the change. Species that do not know how to undergo rapid evolution become extinct "And we're in this event," says Naveh. "We see different behavior of birds, a change of migration route because we have reduced living space and turned swamps into ponds, their food quality has gone down and stress has gone up, the duck no longer sits in its quiet swamp but sees machines and people and it all damages their immune system and biological resilience. In their ability to resist viruses."

Experts agree that the disease is likely to hit Israel again next fall [2022]. For example, it is known that the virus has infected a population of gulls that usually nest in the Atlit area. They call on the Ministry of Agriculture, the JNF and other bodies to get organized for this purpose in preparing teams for skipping and evacuating damaged areas and to increase biological security on poultry farms and coops.

Thus, according to some experts, the Ministry of Agriculture should order farmers to increase bio security on the chicken coops --- erect fences, prevent the entry of vehicles and unauthorized people, establish shower procedures and clothes changing for workers and more. In addition, they say that the possibility of vaccinating the farm's poultry should be examined.

"One of the things that is missing in the State of Israel is preparation. The decision must be made. In Europe they are testing vaccines, in the US they have set up a vaccines bank. Israel does not have the knowledge and readiness in case of an outbreak," Elkin adds. According to him, to this day the Western world has preferred not to vaccinate to prevent the virus getting established within animal populations which get infected without showing clinical signs. However, countries like China and Mexico did vaccinate.

Poultry flu is a negative outcome of the meat and poultry industry. The plague would not have broken out without the industrialized and crowded growing methods. Thus, the farm where the virus first broke out is an industrial farm that used a natural water source to raise waterfowl -- what experts view as the perfect recipe for creating new virus strains, benefiting from nature's genetic reservoir, combined with overcrowded birds in weak health status. Meanwhile, the recent eruption in Israel also affected Naveh's menu. "All my life I grew up in chicken coops," he says, "my dad is a poultry veterinarian. At the last event I realized it's unhealthy for my body to eat poultry."

The Ministry of Agriculture responded: "The veterinary services in the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development are regularly prepared for optimal management of outbreaks of avian influenza, and prevention of its spread. Avian influenza in Israel is currently not an endemic disease, much thanks to the management of the outbreaks' foci by the veterinary services. The ministry strictly follows the epidemiological developments around the world, and -- as every year prior to the bird migration seasons -- distributes guidelines to farmers and enforces their compliance. At the same time, animal welfare regulations were recently approved by the Knesset Education Committee. As part of the regulations, new cage coops will no longer be established in Israel, and the entire layers branch will gradually move to the use of advanced coops that allow for more effective treatment of disease."

[HPAI H5N1 caused some earlier events of mass mortality in wild birds. In May 2005, thousands of wild geese died at Qinghai Lake in China. A smaller outbreak in migrant geese and swans followed, during 2009, in Mongolia (20060127.0255, item 2; 20090527.1971).

The recent explosive events in wild birds in 4 continents, and their interaction with outbreaks in farmed birds as demonstrated in Israel, are concerning. The article above provides an updated background illustrating the need for intensified, internationally coordinated efforts to control avian influenza in both wild and farmed bird species: a One Health project. - Mod.AS

The conservation impact of HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4 needs to be assessed. The mortalities reported in Eurasia and America surely add to the burden wild bird populations already face due to the multiple stressors of global environmental change. - Mod.PMB]
