The Livingston County Health Department said that they have confirmed the 17th case of eastern equine encephalitis in a horse from Hamburg Township.

The horse, an unvaccinated 3-year-old Paint gelding, had a sudden onset of neurological signs on [23 Sep 2019] and was euthanized. According to the health department, there have been no human cases of EEE reported in Livingston County.

According to the state, there have been 9 cases of EEE confirmed in residents of Barry, Berrien, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo, and Van Buren counties, including 3 deaths.

There have also been 17 animal cases of EEE confirmed; 15 equine and 2 canines, which were 2 wolf pups who both died at the Binder Park Zoo in Battle Creek.

EEE is very rare, but it is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the US, with a 33 percent fatality rate in people who become ill. The virus is transmitted to humans and other mammals through the bite of an infected mosquito.

Severe cases of EEE infection begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma. Anyone who thinks they may be experiencing these symptoms should contact a medical provider.

The state is reminding people that mosquitoes capable of transmitting the disease are assumed to be widespread throughout the region and will remain until the 1st hard frost reduces the mosquito population.

Michigan is also spraying in 14 counties for mosquitoes to stop the spread of EEE.

Residents should take these steps to avoid contracting EEE:
- avoid being outdoors between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes that carry EEE virus are most active;
- apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other US Environmental Protection Agency-registered product to exposed skin or clothing, and always follow the manufacturer's directions for use;
- wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites;
- maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside;
- empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused kiddie pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs;
- use nets and/or fans over outdoor eating areas.

Eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] continues to be a problem in the central part of the country.

According to the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH), there have been 11 cases of EEE in horses and 10 of them either died from the mosquito-borne illness or had to be euthanize because of it.

EEE is fatal to approximately 30 percent of the humans who contract it, according to the Center for Disease Control. Additionally, those who survive can have ongoing neurological problems.

Typically, about 9 humans contract EEE a year but this year [2019] there have already been 27 cases.

Last week [week of 23 Sep 2019], Michigan took precautions against EEE by aerial spraying in some counties.

The Connecticut Department of Agriculture (CDA) confirmed on 20 Sep 2019 a 4th New London County horse tested positive for eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE). The under-vaccinated 7-year-old miniature horse mare began showing clinical signs, including circling, leaning, and shaking, with sudden onset and progressive decline on 13 Sep 2019. The horse had no recent travel history and was euthanized.

Of the 3 Connecticut horses previously confirmed in September [2019], 2 were euthanized and 1 was reported to be recovering with treatment.

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquito-borne diseases in the United States.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include:
- avoid mosquito bites: Use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn;
- look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol);
- apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite;
- mosquito-proof homes: fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs;
- protect your horses: veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the US. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses;
- use approved insect repellents to protect horses;
- if possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn.
- eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly;
- stock water tanks with fish consuming mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [Bti], which are nontoxic to [mammals, including humans, birds, beneficial insects, plants, fish and most other aquatic organisms]) available at hardware stores.

Eastern equine encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes. Those mosquitoes pass the virus to horses and humans, but horses cannot pass the virus to humans without a mosquito vector.

Consequently, with many horses and humans having EEE, it is likely we all will be glad for some cool to colder weather causing the mosquitoes to die, thereby strongly diminishing or stopping the outbreak of EEE. - Mod.TG]
