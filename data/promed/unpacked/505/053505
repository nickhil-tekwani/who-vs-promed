63 percent of the water bodies in Moscow were infested with larva of
malaria mosquitoes in 2007. Rospotrebnadzor keeps special records [on
mosquito larvae], and the results show that out of 722 water bodies,
541 contained mosquito larvae, and 461 (63 percent) contained larvae
of malaria mosquitoes.

During the 1st half of 2007, 17 cases of malaria were registered in
Moscow, which is the highest in all of Russia. 46 cases of malaria
were registered in 2006 and 60 in 2005.

Unlike during previous years, the majority of malaria cases in 2006
were of the tropical type (52.4 percent). The official statistics for
all of Russia are 143 cases, which is lower by 28.5 percent than in
2005. Because of this unsatisfactory situation, several meetings were
held between the interested agencies, and proposals were sent to
local administrations and park management organizations for
improvement of sanitary conditions. Three day malaria [_P. vivax_
malaria] happens in Moscow every year, which is the result of climate warming.

The mosquitoes were not that successful before, when the summers were
short and not hot. They breed in waters rich in flora contaminated
with residential garbage.

The main way to control the breeding of mosquitoes is to clean the
water and populate it with larvae-eating fish. Tropical malaria [_P.
falciparum_] in Moscow is imported. Previously, it was being brought
in by foreign students. Presently, many illegal migrants from
Azerbaijan and Tajikistan bring tropical malaria [_P. falciparum_]
from their countries.

[It is difficult to interpret the reported numbers for malaria in
Moscow, as it is not clear how many are locally infected and how many
are imported cases. The data available from the WHO Regional Office
for Europe through the Central Information System for Infectious
Diseases <http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/>, which provides data on
selected infectious diseases for Europe, indicates that the Russian
Federation reported 11 autochthonous cases in 2006 (latest year for
which data are available), 40 in 2005, 0 in 2004, 72 in 2003 and 139
in 2002. The Russian federation reported 132 imported cases of
malaria in 2006, 165 in 2005, 382 in 2004, 461 in 2003 and 503 in 2002.

Local transmission of _P. falciparum_ from imported cases is a
possibility, but the cold climate during the winter months excludes
that _P. falciparum_ can become endemic in Moscow.

_P. vivax_ exists in a temperate variant named _P. vivax hibernans_,
in which the incubation period is prolonged, so individuals become
infected in autumn, but the clinical attack does not come before the
following spring, 6 to 8 months later. This form of _P. vivax_ is
common in northern temperate areas, including Russia, Siberia and Scandinavia.

Malaria prevalence in pre-control times can be seen from data from
military facilities in St. Petersburg in 1900 (6.6 per 1000) and in
Moscow during the same year (31 per 1000).

Malaria in the Russian federation came under control after WWII due
to a combination of classical drainage, insecticide spraying,
chemotherapy, and was regarded as eradicated in 1960. - Mod.EP]

[More information on the epidemiology of malaria in Russia and more
specifically Moscow, including 2007 data would be greatly appreciated.
