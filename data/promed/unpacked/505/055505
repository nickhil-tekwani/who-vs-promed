[This is Nigeria's 2nd event of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) occurring in January 2015.

According to the epidemiological comment in their report, "The outbreak occurred in a live bird market where birds (local/exotic) from different parts of the country are sold."

If the birds originated from different parts of the country, and if there is reasonable surveillance, it may be just a matter of time before new outbreaks are noticed and reported. Further, if exposed birds were purchased and are not immediately consumed, there is a possibility of further exposure. Based on what Nigeria reported, there were 50 000 susceptible birds, and 3300 of these died. The disposition of the other 46 700 birds is not clear. Were they sold? It would be of interest to learn what happened to these.

"Infected domestic birds are the most dangerous source of virus, followed by inanimate objects (fomites) contaminated with secretions (in particular faeces from infected birds). Airborne spread is not considered to be significant. Prevention and control of the disease involves 'finding it fast', 'killing it rapidly', and 'stopping its spread'. All 3 of these objectives must be achieved rapidly and simultaneously for disease to be effectively controlled. Continuous and vigilant surveillance helps to detect disease early once it has occurred. Culling is a very effective response if implemented early and consistently along with local incentives, including fair compensation.

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza is a disease that can be controlled through the application of effective biosecurity measures because it is highly dependent on the actions of people for its spread" (http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/249466/aj132e00.pdf).

In the follow-up report No. 1 of the event reported on 10 Jan 2015, 4 new outbreaks in the region of Kano have been reported. The report is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16970.

To date, only serotype H5N1 has been identified in Nigeria. See comments in ProMED-mail post 20150110.3083730.

Although this event may also be associated with H5N1, information on the neuraminidase type would be much appreciated, particularly given the recent spread of the highly pathogenic H5N8 subtype. - Mod.CRD
