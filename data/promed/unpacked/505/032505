New Cases of Bobcat Fever Prompts Tick Control Warning
------------------------------------------------------
Cytauxzoonosis, a parasitic blood infection also known as "bobcat
fever," has been linked to several cat deaths in Mississippi.

Cats need tick control to prevent a fatal disease that has recently
spread through much of the south and eastern seaboard of the United
States. Although the disease is not new to the state, these cases have
prompted veterinarians to stress the importance of tick control to pet
owners. "The key to protecting your cat is prevention because there is
no cure for this disease," said Sharon Grace, DVM, clinical professor
at Mississippi State University (MSU) College of Veterinary Medicine.
"Owners need to apply a topical product that will kill ticks that
carry the pathogen."

Even indoor cats need tick control because the American dog tick, the
carrier of the disease which picks up the pathogen from an infected
bobcat, can unknowingly be brought into the house by a human or a dog,
she said. The product must contain fipronil for tick control to be
effective, Dr. Grace said.

Dogs cannot contract the disease and neither can humans. Also,
infected cats cannot give the disease to other cats.

"This terrible disease is difficult to diagnose and treat, fatal in
most cats, and hard to observe in a patient dying of it," she said.
"The goal is to identify the disease early enough so that the
veterinarian can humanely euthanize the cat to prevent further
suffering."

Symptoms, which can be confused with other diseases such as
mycoplasma, toxoplasmosis and feline infectious peritonitis, include
becoming depressed and listless, and refusing to eat and drink. Cats
can look jaundiced and have a paleness around their gums, nose and eye
tissue. An extreme fever as high as 108 degrees F is the most
observable sign, according to MSU.

Cytauxzoonosis, which was 1st discovered in Missouri and eastern
Oklahoma in about 1973, is being reported more often and is moving
boundaries. The seasonal movement of bobcats and ticks has distributed
the disease through much of the south and the eastern seaboard of the
United States. There is evidence the disease is also moving north,
Grace said.

There are still a lot of unanswered questions and more research is
needed to get a better understanding of the disease, Grace said.

[The Merck Veterinary Manual
(http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/10404.htm)
describes it as follows:

Cytauxzoonosis is caused by the Theileria-like parasites of the genus
_Cytauxzoon_ of the family Theileriidae. Currently there is some
dispute as to its taxonomic status, but its multiplication by
schizogony in mononuclear phagocytes (macrophages) rather than
lymphocytes as for Theileria spp is a strong argument for its
classification in a separate genus.

Etiology and Transmission:
_Cytauxzoon spp_ infect ungulates in Africa while _C felis_ is a
natural parasite of wild cats (bobcat [_Lynx rufus_] and the Florida
panther [_Felis concolor coryi_]) of North America. C felis is
transmitted by the Ixodid tick Dermacentor variabilis; as a parasite
of wild cats its pathogenicity is unknown. Tick transmission to
domestic cats results in an acute and almost always fatal disease.
Most cases occur in the south and southeast states of the USA and are
usually associated with access to wooded areas. However, transmission
by blood infection appears to result in disease with variable
pathogenicity and often is not fatal. Studies of _C felis_ in
northwestern Arkansas and northeastern Oklahoma indicate that less
virulent strains may be present in these areas. This is evidenced by
mild to asymptomatic clinical signs and recovery without treatment for
infected cats. _Cytauxzoon spp_ in African ungulates are thought to be
transmitted by _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_. Young, stressed, or
immunocompromised animals are thought to be at greatest risk.

Clinical Findings and Lesions:
Onset of clinical signs for cats infected with _C felis_ usually
occurs about 10 days after infection by tick transmission. Severe
signs are usually evident 6 days later. Cats are febrile, anorectic,
weak, depressed, dyspneic, and dehydrated. Temperatures may be as high
as 105 degF (40.5 degC) but usually become subnormal in extremis.
Mucous membranes are often icteric.

At necropsy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, enlarged lymph nodes, and
renal edema are usually observed. The lungs show extensive edema and
congestion with petechial hemorrhage on serosal surfaces and
throughout the interstitium. There is progressive venous distension,
especially the mesenteric and renal veins and the posterior vena cava.
Hydropericardium is often seen with petechial hemorrhage of the
epicardium.

Diagnosis:
Hematology shows a normochromic, normocytic anemia with a declining
leukopenia and pronounced lymphopenia. Occasionally, mononuclear
phagocytes with schizont-filled cytoplasm are observed in peripheral
blood smears. Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears reveal
pleomorphic, intraerythrocytic protozoan parasites that usually appear
about 10 days after infection. Parasites may be round, oval,
anaplasmoid, bipolar, or rod-shaped.

The tissue stage of _C felis_ is schizonts in the cytoplasm of
mononuclear phagocytes that are attached to the endothelium of
vessels. These phagocytes can be identified in the interstitium of the
spleen, popliteal lymph node, liver, and bone marrow.

Treatment and Control:
Attempts to treat this pathogen have met with little success.
Parvaquone (20 or 30 mg/kg, IM, sid) and buparvaquone (5 or 10 mg/kg,
IM, sid) once parasites were detected were not successful. Treatment
with trimethoprim/sulfadiazine (60 mg, SC, bid) with supportive
therapy has been unsuccessful (1 cat) while treatment with sodium
thiacetarsamide (0.1 mg/kg, IV) for 2-3 days resulted in survival of 1
of 2 cats. More recently, 6 of 7 cats were successfully treated with
diminazene aceturate (not approved in the USA) or imidocarb
dipropionate (2 mg/kg, IM, 2 injections 3-7 days apart). Exclusion of
cats from areas likely to be infested with the tick vector is the best
method of control.
