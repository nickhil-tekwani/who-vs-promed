Syphilis rates among gay men have been rising in Los Angeles County [California] and around the country for several years, leading the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to finally take a look at the numbers of this sexually transmitted disease on a state-by-state level.

Nationwide data shows a 15 percent increase in the number of syphilis infections overall from 2013 to 2014 alone.

Two new studies presented at the CDC's 2016 STD Prevention Conference [https://www.cdc.gov/stdconference/], however, suggest that syphilis is taking a particularly severe toll on gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM), especially in the Southeastern U.S.

Nationally, the data show the estimated [primary and secondary] syphilis rate among MSM is 309 cases per 100 000. But estimates vary state-to-state for syphilis [incidence] rates among MSM from 73.1 per 100 000 individuals in Alaska to 748.3 per 100 000 individuals in North Carolina -- with no real explanation as to why that state's rates are so high. California levels [at nearly 332.2 cases per 100 000] are well above the national average. [See the source URL for CDC data on the primary and secondary syphilis incidence rates among MSM by state and region of the U.S. for 2015.]

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reports that since 2010, the number of reported cases [of primary and secondary syphilis] has increased by 74 percent. [The number of cases of primary and secondary syphilis rose from 632 in 2010 to 1097 in 2014 -- http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf.]

In 2014 alone there was a dramatic surge of congenital syphilis (a severe, disabling and often life-threatening form of the disease) with 31 cases reported, an increase over previous years of more than 300 percent [http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf].

According to the 2014 Annual HIV/STD Surveillance Report from the Los Angeles County Department of Health, LA county reported the highest rate of HIV infection in the nation at 1820 per 100 000. [The total number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in Los Angeles County in 2013 was 1820, not the rate, which was 18 per 100 000. The number of cases was highest among large urban US counties and independent cities in the U.S., but the HIV diagnosis rate in Los Angeles County in 2013 was actually similar to or lower than that of other large urban jurisdictions in the U.S. -- see Table 1.2 in http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf.] The county appears to have the nation's highest rate of new HIV infections [no], though that number declined very slightly in the past year. [The rate per 100 000 of newly diagnosed HIV fell from 22 in 2010 to 18 in 2013. The rate of HIV diagnoses in LA County had been decreasing since 2008 (see Figure 1.2, http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf]. LA County has the nation's highest number of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia infection [among large urban U.S. counties and independent cities in the U.S., but the rates actually similar to or lower than that of other large urban jurisdictions in the U.S.; see Table 1.2, http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/DHSP/Reports/HIV-STDsurveillanceReport2014.pdf].

"These studies underscore the critical importance of syphilis screening and care for gay and bisexual men. Prompt diagnosis and complete antibiotic treatment is essential to cure syphilis infections, prevent long-term health complications and stop the spread of infection," said Rachel Wingard, a spokesperson for the CDC.

Los Angeles headquartered AIDS Healthcare Foundation, led by Michael Weinstein, is among a handful of agencies nationwide to stress other STDs in its prevention messages, focusing on the risks of contracting gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia if you engage in sex without condoms in its prevention messages.

Transmission of HIV has been the primary concern of AIDS activists and many advocacy organizations, leaving prevention of other sexually transmitted diseases to only casual attention.

The "No Glove, No Love" condom code -- a staple STD catchall -- has been supplanted, some would say, by the now widely touted PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis), a pill that (if taken daily) blocks HIV and is often used without a condom, despite the CDC recommended protocol. PrEP, however, does nothing to prevent other STDs. [See prior ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803.]

Proponents of PrEP have argued passionately that such concerns do not outweigh the benefits of a reduction in HIV infection rates that might one day result in an end to AIDS as a crisis (at least a Western one). And while there is no evidence or suggestion of any kind that use of or promotion of PrEP has led to the problems highlighted by the new STD revelations from the CDC, it does raise concerns about safer-sex messaging. PrEP certainly has benefits if properly utilized, as outlined in this study by UCLA Raphael J Landovitz entitled "PrEP Adherence Enhancement Guided [by iTAB and Drug Levels for Women]" [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02584140].

[For a discussion of PrEP, see prior ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (09): (MS) MSM, PrEP 20160921.4503803.

If some of the increasing numbers of MSM also have unprotected sex with wives and girlfriends, there may be a spillover that could lead to a rising incidence of syphilis in women and congenital syphilis. Syphilis can be passed from mother to infant during pregnancy, causing congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis cases are attributable to a lack of prenatal care, because mother-to-infant transmission of syphilis can be prevented or mother-to-infant transmission that has already occurred can be treated with benzathine penicillin G when maternal syphilis is detected. - Mod.ML
