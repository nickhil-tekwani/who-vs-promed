A Jefferson County resident has died after contracting hepatitis A. The announcement came from Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness on [Tue 6 Mar 2018] afternoon, as the state continues to battle an outbreak of acute hepatitis A among the city's homeless and drug users. The person who died has not been identified, but officials say the victim had other health issues whose symptoms and lab results met the case definition of acute hepatitis A infection.

Kentucky declared an outbreak of acute hepatitis A in several counties on [21 Nov 2017]. So far, there have been 150 cases in Kentucky -- and 124 of those cases were in Louisville. Officials with Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness said they started noticing a few cases last August [2017]. By November [2017], the county documented at least 30 cases.

Director Lori Caloia said the state of Kentucky usually only see 20 cases each year. "For the outbreak itself, the at-risk populations are a little bit different than what the CDC's website would say," Caloia said.

The department is focused on vaccinating as many people in the high-risk categories, including the homeless and drug users, as possible. Caloia said it's a misconception that drug users will avoid getting hepatitis A if they avoid using needles. "It's not just IV drug use," she said. "Hepatitis B and C are spread through IV use, but hepatitis A is spread more through contact with contaminated surfaces."

Caloia said the spread of the virus could start once someone with Hepatitis A does not properly wash his or her hands and then touches any surface, object, food or liquid. "It's the fecal-oral route," Caloia said. "So someone has perhaps used the bathroom and has hepatitis A, they may wash their hands but may have contaminated a surface. Someone else touches that same surface, and they can contract the virus."

She says common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or stomach pain, jaundice or yellowing of the skin or eyes, light-colored stool, dark-colored urine, fever, chills and body aches. "Hepatitis A is more of an acute illness, typically," Caloia said. "So you get sick, you get pretty sick all at once. And then you tend to recover and get better pretty rapidly."

Since [1 Jan 2017], Utah public health has identified 217 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection. For more information on hepatitis A, click here [there is a link in the original URL].

[It is interesting that so far in Utah there have been no fatalities whereas the large outbreaks in southern California and southeastern Michigan reported case fatality rates of 3-4 percent. The hospitalization rate in Utah while high is also substantially below the 70-80 percent rate in those other outbreaks.

Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in [August 2016], public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Cumulatively, 14.6 percent of the total males are MSM, 2.9 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.6 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total cases continue to increase and have altogether in numbers and in fatalities surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak.
