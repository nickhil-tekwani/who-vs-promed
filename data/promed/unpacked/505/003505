Epidemiological comments: some of the feeder pigs at a quarantine station, which were transported from Taiwan Island to Penghu Island, were found with vesicular lesions. The testing result of collected samples from national laboratory showed positive reaction of RT-PCR tests confirming the serotype O of foot-and-mouth disease infection. All the pigs were destroyed and cleaning and disinfection of the premises were completed. Clinical inspection and epidemiological investigation were conducted on the origin pig farm in Taiwan and surrounding farms that keep cloven-hoofed animals within 3 km [2 mi] radius of the index premise (a total of 1 cattle/goat/deer farm, 1 goat/pig farm, 1 deer farm, 5 goat farms, and 7 cattle farms); the results showed the animals were in healthy condition and no clinical or epidemiological evidence of infection was found. Further tests of samples collected from the slaughtered feeder pigs are ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[There is little chance that this outbreak will spread from the quarantine station and this is an excellent example of how quarantine is an important disease prevention tactic. However, as in all outbreaks, identifying the source is critical to preventing the next outbreak.

Unfortunately, in Taiwan, there have been outbreaks on a regular if not widespread basis over the last couple years. Intensive outbreak investigation efforts may be warranted in this situation, especially given the history of FMD in Taiwan. See moderator comments in Foot & mouth disease - Taiwan: (PH) serotype O, porcine, OIE 20110324.0930. - Mod.PC]
