A group of 7 residents in a Belgian nursing home died after infection with a new variant, all of whom were fully vaccinated according to virologists on the scene. Though the vaccine used in these residents was not made public, it was likely either AstraZeneca or an mRNA vaccine such as Pfizer and Moderna, among those most frequently used in the country.

The new variant, B.1.621, has yet to receive a Greek letter designation from the World Health Organization. The variant already accounts for around 2% of coronavirus infections in the United States, and as much as 10% in Miami, according to Carlos Migoya, CEO of Jackson Health System. The variant can be traced back to identification in samples from Colombia in March 2021 and according to the GISAID coronavirus database, the variant has been identified in as many as 28 countries, but potentially more.

Figure 1 shows both the nonsynonymous nucleotide mutations that result in amino acid changes and synonymous "silent" nucleotide mutations in B.1.621 versus the original Wuhan strain. What follows is a brief tour of the potential impact of the mutations beginning at the 5' end of the genome and extending to the 3' end. Altogether, there are 17 nucleotide mutations, of which 13 result in amino acid mutations. [See the Forbes article and the URLs below for figures.]

The 5' most mutation is C241U. This mutation in the untranslated noncoding region, along with P323L in nonstructural protein (NSP) 12 and D614G in the Spike (S) protein, appear in almost all currently circulating strains today. These first appeared in late January and early February 2020 and have since become the dominant strain around the world. Almost all variants of interest or concern harbor these 3 mutations derived from the early variant. The D614G mutation in the S protein is critical to increased transmissibility and P323L in NSP12 is speculated to increase the replication efficiency of the virus. Here we speculate that the C241U 5' end mutation may confer increased production of full-length genomic RNA and packaging efficiency. This mutation is located in loop 3 of the leader sequence of genomic and subgenomic RNAs. We also note this mutation may affect the frequency of translation as it is located 25 nucleotides 5' to the Orf1ab initiation codon.

The B.1.621 variant has two mutations in NSP3--one silent and one amino acid altering. NSP3 is a multi-domain protein with a number of different functions. C3037U is a synonymous mutation that lies in the Acidic C-terminal (Ac) domain. The next mutation, T720I, lies in the SARS-specific unique domain (SUD). The SUD is involved in the formation of G-quadruplexes, which play a role in the modulation of host cell response to infection. Threonine to isoleucine is a major, polar-to-hydrophobic change, indicating a potentially major contribution to the SUD's operation.

Q160R is found in NSP6. This mutation is another major change from polar uncharged glutamine to positively charged arginine, which has a potential effect on protein structure and function. NSP6 is involved in a protein involved in the formation of the double-membrane replication vesicle, major inhibition of human immune responses by inhibiting STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation, and inhibition TANK binding kinase 1. We speculate that this mutation may contribute to pathogenesis by increased suppression of the immune response allowing the virus additional opportunity to replicate.

C18877U is located in NSP14 and C20148U is located in NSP15. As silent mutations, they may have an effect on the stability of the messenger RNA. The S protein of B.1.621 carries 6 common mutations in GISAID sequenced samples.

The most 5' mutation in the S protein is T95I in the N-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is a major binding site for monoclonal antibodies and other antiviral treatments. Mutations to this domain have been shown to increase virus escape from these medical interventions. T95I is a change from polar threonine to hydrophobic isoleucine. We speculate this could eliminate a binding site, potentially contributing to immune evasion. The significance of this mutation is heightened by the independent observation of the T95I mutation in the Iota variant of interest.

There are 2 mutations in the receptor-binding domain. The receptor-binding domain interacts directly with the host receptor ACE2. The mutations in the receptor-binding domain are found in many variants of interest and concern. E484K is reported to increase viral resistance to monoclonal antibodies and convalescent sera. N501Y is consistently noted to highly increase avidity between the receptor-binding domain and ACE2 receptor. Both are present in a number of VOIs and VOCs, including alpha, beta, gamma, eta, and iota.

The S protein also carries the P681H mutation. Both this and D614G are associated with enhancing the furin cleavage site in the middle portion of the S protein, which again contributes to highly increased transmissibility. D614G is a major change from negative aspartic acid to uncharged glycine. P681H is uncharged proline to positive arginine, again indicating a significant change. The P681H mutation is notable for its observation in the alpha variant, the fuel behind the third wave of COVID-19 in late 2020 and early 2021.

The final S protein mutation is D950N. The mutation is located in heptad repeat 1. The change from aspartic acid to asparagine is negative to polar uncharged, indicating a major shift in charge and polarity. Although the exact function of this mutation is unknown, it is also found in the currently pervasive delta variant, likely indicating some unknown increase in viral infectivity. Below is a comprehensive summary of the B.1.621 S protein and the documented and potential effects of its mutations (Figure 2).

Our conclusion from the extensive set of mutations found in this particular variant is that it deserves to be observed closely. We have been informed through private communication that because of the Orf3a deletion, it may not routinely be included in the GISAID catalog. Therefore, the representation of its true frequency in populations around the world is underrepresented. B.1.621 clearly has the potential to be lethal in vaccinated elderly patients and may have the potential to become more transmissible as well. Given the described changes, we can begin to understand why the B.1.621 variant should be considered certainly a variant of interest, if not a variant of concern, and merits much closer observation in the coming weeks and months.

A Taiwanese woman who tested positive for COVID-19 after returning from the United States in early August [2021] has been infected by the coronavirus variant discovered in Colombia, the 1st case of the new variant in Taiwan.

The woman in her 60s had received 2 jabs of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the United States in July [2021] before arriving back in Taiwan on 3 Aug [2021], Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) official Lo Yi-chun said at the CECC's regular press briefing Fri [13 Aug 2021].

A deep-throat saliva test the traveler received upon her arrival found she had contracted COVID-19 even though she was asymptomatic, and she was isolated at a government-run quarantine center, Lo said.

Gene-sequencing later found the woman to be infected with the Colombian variant, known as the B.1.621 variant, Lo said, and she was transferred to a negative pressure isolation ward at a hospital.

The patient has been asymptomatic and her viral load has remained low, however, and an evaluation is being conducted to determine if she can be released from isolation, Lo said.

It was the 1st time the Colombian variant was detected in Taiwan, Lo said, after first being discovered in Colombia in January 2021. The World Health Organization did not put it on its list of COVID-19 variants until May [2021]. Currently the variant has yet to receive a Greek-letter designation as more prominent variants have, Lo added.

According to Lo, the Colombian variant has been reported in at least 28 countries around the world, with about 2% of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. caused by the emerging variant.

The variant has received attention worldwide since it was found to be behind a recent cluster infection at a seniors' home in Belgium, where it claimed 7 lives despite all the deceased being fully vaccinated. [see [A] above]

Lo said there have been no reports indicating the Colombian variant is deadlier, more pathogenic, or more infectious than other variants, but it was found to be endowed with features of both the alpha and beta variants.

On Fri [13 Aug 2021], the CECC [Congressional-Executive Commission on China] published the gene-sequencing results of 6 imported COVID-19 cases from the United Kingdom, the U.S., China, Malaysia and Israel between 6 Aug and 12 Aug [2021], including the one caused by the Colombia variant.

4 of the other 5 cases were identified as being caused by the delta variant that was first discovered in India, and the other case involved the alpha variant, according to the CECC.

[This case which is asymptomatic appears to be much less severe than those reported in the Belgian nursing home where the cases were fatal. This patient was infected in the United States before going to Taiwan and had been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the United States. It is not known exactly which vaccine the Belgian residents had been immunized with. - Mod.LK]

[2] Canada: vaccination requirement

All passengers and workers on commercial air flights in Canada will soon have to prove they've been vaccinated against the coronavirus. Canada's government will also require all federal workers to be vaccinated, citing a "dynamic public health situation" due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The new travel vaccination policy will apply to passengers and workers in the federally regulated air, train and cruise ship sectors. It will be enacted "as soon as possible in the fall and no later than the end of October [2021]," the Canadian Treasury Board said on Fri [13 Aug 20121].

"Canadians deserve to feel confident when traveling that the environment around them is safe," Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said. "We need to regain public confidence in travel" to help the industry that's been hobbled by the pandemic, he added.

Details of the new vaccine mandate are still being worked out, the government said. Exceptions to the policy would require safety measures such as testing and screening.

On Mon [9 Aug 2021], Canada moved to reopen its border with the U.S., easing its travel ban in cases where would-be visitors from the U.S. have been vaccinated for at least 14 days and test negative for the coronavirus. Canada is Americans' 2nd most popular travel destination, 2nd only to Mexico.

Canada's new mandate for federal workers could come into effect "as early as the end of September [2021]," the government said. The policy promises to affect more than 1.2 million employees -- 8% of Canada's workforce -- who either work for the government directly or work in federal-regulated industries and at federal Crown corporations, which are essentially state-owned enterprises.

Canada has already endured 2 large waves in coronavirus cases -- one at the turn of the year, and a 2nd in the spring. With indicators now trending upward again, Canadian leaders are imposing new policies to boost vaccinations and limit the spread of the coronavirus.

"More than 71% of eligible people in Canada are fully vaccinated, and more than 82% have had their first shot," the treasury board said. "However, more than 6 million eligible people in Canada are still unvaccinated."

As of late July [2021], Canada had reported 53 111 coronavirus cases in the federal public service, the government said Fri [13 Aug 2021]. Overall, Canada has reported more than 1.4 million cases and nearly 26 700 deaths from COVID-19.

[Canada is responding quickly and appropriately to this "dynamic public health situation" due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Requiring vaccination to travel may be the only way to convince unvaccinated individuals it is past time to get vaccinated. Yet it is impressive that 71% of eligible Canadians are fully vaccinated. I assume children under 12 who cannot yet get vaccinated and others with medical exemptions are exceptions to the policy, as well as individuals who can prove they were infected naturally and are immune. It also should be part of the new policy that masks are required on flights and other locations where there are large groups of people in enclosed spaces. - Mod.LK]

...While the disease has been less lethal, with fewer than 3000 deaths per week compared to more than 20 000 a few months ago, the spread of the variant delta SARS-CoV-2 virus is out of control in some states.

Added to this is the stagnation in vaccination rates, mainly in conservative states in the southeast of the country.

"It's really a pandemic among the unvaccinated," Fauci told CNN on Sun [25 Jul].

A recent study, which appears in the journal PLOS One , reports that a quarter of the study participants had long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19 between 6 and 8 months after initial infection.

The participants had lingering symptoms of difficulty breathing and fatigue, and assessment results that indicated depression.

https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/news/virus-transmission-if-not-checked-situation-may-turn-grave-2151041


Health Minister Zahid Maleque yesterday [12 Aug 2021] said the COVID-19 situation in the country will turn grave unless the transmission of the virus is controlled.

"Unless we can control corona [COVID-19], the situation will become even tougher," he said while addressing a seminar -- "Challenges of COVID Pandemic and Dengue Outbreak" -- as chief guest.

The event was organised by Bangladesh Society of Medicine in association with US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Dhaka.

"The transmission has declined a little bit in recent days, but the number of deaths is still higher. We have to keep this transmission under control. For this, we have to adhere to health rules. Crowded buses and trains will only worsen the situation," the minister said.

However, the country yesterday [12 Aug 2021] recorded the lowest COVID-19 deaths -- 215 -- in the past 10 days.

Since [2 Aug 2021] the positivity rate has been declining steadily. Yesterday [12 Aug 2021], the positivity rate was 22.46% while it was around 30% on [2 Aug 2021].

A total of 10 126 COVID-19 cases were detected yesterday [12 Aug 2021] -- the lowest since Monday [9 Aug 2021].

In the seminar, the health minister also said the government is trying to vaccinate everyone gradually. "We cannot vaccinate the entire population at once. People need to be patient," he said, adding, "We are gradually vaccinating everyone. Millions have already registered."

Bangladesh can neither obtain nor store all the vaccines needed to inoculate 80% of the total population at once, he said.

"In order to vaccinate 80%, 26 - 27 crore [260 - 270 million] doses will be required. We are trying to bring in whatever quantity of vaccine doses are available.

"The world's largest countries have developed and stockpiled on vaccines. They have stocked 4 to 5 times more than they need, while many countries are yet to receive vaccine doses."

He further said, "Those who are always criticising ask where vaccines are when we don't have enough. When we do, they ask why so many people turn up to get jabs. It seems, either way, they have problems. It's very easy to criticise."

About vaccine supply, Zahid Maleque said, "54 lakh [5 400 000] more vaccine doses will reach within the next week and around one crore [10 million] in total by this month [August 2021]. The vaccination programme will continue."

Speaking at the seminar, Prof Abul Bashar Mohammad Khurshid Alam, director of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), said, "If the infection rate further rises, it cannot be tackled. We have already increased hospital beds, but that has a limit too. It is not possible to increase them further."

Other speakers stressed preventive measures against COVID-19 and dengue to reduce pressure on hospitals. Prof Md Billal Alam, president of Bangladesh Society of Medicine, presided over the event, while Dr Mohammad Shahidullah, president of the National Technical Advisory Committee on COVID-19, Dr Nazmul Islam, line director (Communicable Disease Control) of the DGHS also
spoke at the event among others.

Fresh COVID-19 cases remained above 20 000 for the 3rd day running in Kerala while Maharashtra's count topped 6000 for the 1st time in 5 days even as daily cases in India continued to decline marginally while staying close to the 40 000 mark.

India has seen a steady, although painfully slow, fall in daily COVID-19 cases so far in August [2021] after a spike in the last week of July [2021]. The 7-day rolling average of daily cases, which had risen to 40 832 on [1 Aug 2021], stood at 37 719 on [Wed 11 Aug 2021], the lowest since [25 Jul 2021].

India was likely to record its 2nd straight day of 40 000-plus new cases. After logging 41 649 on [Wed 11 Aug 2021], daily cases on [Thu 12 Aug 2021] stood at 39 248, with updates from Manipur, Tripura, and Jharkhand still awaited. The 3 states had together reported more than 850 cases on the previous day.

Kerala recorded 21 445 fresh infections, continuing to account for more than 50% of all new cases in the country. The state reported a test positivity rate of 14.73%, up from 14.49% on [Wed 11 Aug 2021], indicating that the virus was continuing to rage in the region.

While Karnataka reported 1857 new cases, the highest count in the state came from the Dakshina Kannada district bordering Kerala.

Maharashtra logged 6388 fresh cases, the daily tally having crossed 6000 for the 1st time since [7 Aug 2021]. The state also recorded more than 200 deaths (208) for the 1st time in August [2021].

The spurt in fatalities took the day's COVID-19 toll in the country to 570, the highest in 6 days. Kerala recorded 160 deaths, followed by 67 in Odisha, 33 in Tamil Nadu, and 30 in Karnataka.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 13 Aug 2021 at 07:10 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 32 117 826 / 430 285 / 308
Bangladesh: 1 396 868 / 23 613/ 142
Pakistan: 1 089 913 / 24 266 / 108
Nepal: 725 769 / 10 212 / 344
Sri Lanka: 345 118 / 5620 / 261
Afghanistan: 151 770 / 7000 / 175
Maldives: 78 815 / 222 / 403
Bhutan: 2553 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 261 069, 74 214, 31 508, 17 690, 23 689, and 1964 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 284 413, 96 401, 33 544, 17 437, 17 227, and 3283 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a slowly decreasing trend in India, a decreasing trend for the 1st time in Bangladesh since the new peak started building up from the beginning of last month (July 2021), almost a stable trend in Pakistan and Nepal, a decreasing trend in Afghanistan, but the continuation of the development of a sharp peak of new cases in Sri Lanka.

Live Situational Analysis on COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka can be seen at https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/. For the 1st time, the number of daily deaths in Sri Lanka attributed to the disease crossed the mark of 100, and such a death trend continued for
the last 3 consecutive days. The situation would aggravate further due to the spread of the delta variant in the country.

It is hard to comment whether or not the new wave in Pakistan has reached its peak because we are seeing a kind of stability of new cases over a period of just 7 days. Because the delta variant of the virus is active in the country, the possibility of seeing a reverse trend in the next week or so cannot be ruled out.

The current proportional case positivity is much higher in Bangladesh compared to other South Asian countries. Although the daily case positivity dropped to around 23% from the highest positivity of around 32% seen in the current peak, the country has withdrawn the strict lockdown measures imposed for 19 days in total with a recession of 7 days to celebrate Eid-ul-Adha ("Festival of Sacrifice").

The government has decided to lift most of the restrictions from 19 Aug 2021 despite a prevailing case positivity of around 23% and daily deaths of over 200 (https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/governance/news/everything-open-aug-19-2151036.

The beginning of an increasing trend again cannot be ruled out due to this relaxation.

The total number of deaths in Nepal attributed to the disease has crossed the milestone of 10 000, and 7000 in Afghanistan.
