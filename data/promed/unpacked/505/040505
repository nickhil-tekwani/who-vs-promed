NSW [New South Wales] Health is investigating a possible contamination source following confirmation 3 people have developed legionnaires' disease after spending time in the Macquarie Fields area.

A total of 2 males, 1 in his 50s and the other in his 60s and a female in her 70s - all South Western Sydney residents - were reported with the disease in the past week [week of Sun 8 Apr 2018].

All 3 cases developed the disease - a bacterial infection of the lungs - from breathing in water droplets contaminated with _Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria. Legionnaires' disease cannot be spread from person to person.

Dr Kate Alexander, Acting Director Public Health South Western Sydney Local Health District, said the Campbelltown City Council had not been advised of any elevated levels of legionellosis in the area, but has begun precautionary inspection and sampling of cooling towers and other potential sources of contaminated water droplets in the area, in partnership with the public health unit.

"The 3 people diagnosed with legionnaires' disease all spent time in the
Macquarie Fields area during the period they contracted the infection and all reported becoming unwell between [Fri 30 Mar and Mon 9 Apr 2018]," Dr Alexander said.

Isolated cases of Legionnaires' disease occur throughout the year. It is only when 3 or more cases are found to have been in the same area before becoming ill that there is cause for wider concern.

Legionnaires' disease causes fever, chills, a cough and shortness of breath. Dr Alexander said anyone who has recently been in the Macquarie Fields area who develops symptoms of legionnaires' disease, should visit their GP. "The time from exposure to the onset of symptoms is typically between 2 and 10 days," Dr Alexander said. "People who develop this disease are diagnosed by chest X-ray and a urine test [which is able to diagnosis legionnaires' disease due to only one type of _Legionella_, _Legionella pneumonphila_ serotype 1. Diagnosis of other _Legionella_ requires a culture of clinical specimens] and usually require antibiotic treatment in hospital." The bacteria that cause legionnaires' disease live in water and can multiply in the water used to cool air conditioning systems, so infection is prevented by routinely maintaining and treating the systems. People outside can be exposed to the bacteria when a water cooling system emits contaminated water particles into the air.

NSW Health has strengthened the Public Health Regulation to reduce the community's risk of legionnaires' disease, requiring building owners to conduct monthly tests on cooling towers and notify high levels of _Legionella_ and other bacteria to local council. The new regulation came into effect in January this year [2018].

In 2016 and 2017 there were 93 and 81 cases of _Legionella pneumophila_
infection notified to NSW Health. This year [2018] NSW Health has been notified of
27 _Legionella pneumophila_ cases.

[Humans acquire _Legionella_, the cause of legionnaires' disease, usually after inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients, or less commonly by inoculation of wounds. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Gon√ßalves J, Gomes, JP, et al: Probable person-to-person transmission of legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

Genotyping the strains isolated from the 3 patients will help establish a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.
