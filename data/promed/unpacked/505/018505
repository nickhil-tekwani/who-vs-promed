Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance] in St Petersburg and Leningrad regions have found a
quarantine pest in 2 batches of potatoes coming from France and
Belgium. 440 tons of potatoes on 2 ships were contaminated with pale
potato nematode.

Both complete cargoes are expected to be sent for processing to
destroy the quarantine organism. A batch of potatoes from France
infected with pale cyst nematode which was intercepted earlier was
destroyed using bleach.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and
pale (_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop
losses in potato. Other solanaceous crops (such as tomato) and weeds
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. PCN symptoms on potato include
stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a reduced root
system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first
occur in isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread
occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. Disease
management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host
species, use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races, and
nematicides. These control measures can be combined to keep nematode
levels below economic thresholds. Both PCNs have been included on the
alert list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

Pale PCN has never been reported from Russia and its immediate
neighbours. Transport of infected potatoes from the ships to
appropriate facilities followed by processing, as suggested above, is
not without risk and would need to be carried out under quarantine
conditions in order to prevent accidental spread of the pathogens to
local soils. The earlier approach of in situ treatment of infected
cargo with bleach is likely to be a safer option.

Golden PCN is widely distributed in the Eurasian area and has been
reported previously from a number of areas in Russia.
