Anthrax affects 13 people in W Bengal
-------------------------------------
13 people who ate the meat of an anthrax-afflicted cow have contracted the
serious disease in West Bengal's Murshidabad district, senior health
department official said.
Chief medical officer of health (CMOH) Sachidananda Sarkar said the 13
anthrax-affected people were residents of Bagdanaga and Sultanpur village
of the district. He said medical teams were at the 2 villages.
Sarkar said in Murshidabad district altogether 87 people to date since
January 2004 had been affected by anthrax, a disease that afflicts cattle
and is then transmitted to humans.

[We have seen a long string of anthrax reports from Murshidabad district in
West Bengal. For some reason they seem to be unable to control this disease
there, at a cost to date of 87 human cases, quite apart from the livestock
afflicted. I think some local clarification is needed to explain why this
is happening. - Mod.MHJ]
