The Southern Province has recorded over 55 suspected cases of typhoid disease in Mazabuka district. Southern Province Permanent Secretary Sibanze Simuchoba said the outbreak of the disease in the district calls for concerted efforts from various stakeholders, in order to avoid further spread to other neighboring districts.

Mr. Simuchoba revealed that Monze district has recorded 2 suspected cases, while Mazabuka is leading with 55 suspected typhoid cases. And speaking during the Provincial Epidemic Preparedness (PEP) quarterly review meeting in Mazabuka today [Wed 1 Nov 2017], Mr. Simuchoba disclosed that Monze district has since recorded one death.

The Permanent Secretary who is also the Chairperson of the PEP committee, called on the people of Southern Province to maintain high levels of hygiene and prevent outbreaks of diseases. He said government will continue enforcing the statutory instrument No 100 of 2011 which compels residents and various institutions to take responsibility of the waste they produce. Mr. Simuchoba added that everyone should take the responsibility of cleaning the environment and not just leave it to the local councils alone.

And speaking earlier, Mazabuka District Health Director Steven Shajanika said from the 55 suspected typhoid cases, 9 have so far been confirmed. Dr Shajanika said the district has since embarked on sensitizing the public on the possible ways of preventing the outbreak of diseases related to poor sanitation.

Meanwhile Southern Province Health Director Jelita Chiyonga said the authority in the region remains committed towards controlling the outbreak of communicable diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Dr Chiyonga has however appealed to the general public to remain alert and report any suspected cases of cholera and typhoid to the nearest health center. She said with the onset of the rains, disease trends are likely to increase if the public does not maintain good hygiene practices.

[Typhoid fever, so-called enteric fever caused by _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhi, has a totally different presentation from that of the commoner kinds of salmonellosis. Epidemiologically, usually spread by contaminated food or water, typhoid is not a zoonosis like the more commonly seen types of salmonellosis. Clinically, vomiting and diarrhea are typically absent; indeed, constipation is frequently reported. As it is a systemic illness, blood cultures are at least as likely to be positive as stool in enteric fever, particularly early in the course of the infection, and bone marrow cultures may be the most sensitive.

The symptoms of classical typhoid fever typically include fever, anorexia, lethargy, malaise, dull continuous headache, non-productive cough, vague abdominal pain, and constipation. Despite the often high fever, the pulse is often only slightly elevated. During the 2nd week of the illness, there is protracted fever and mental dullness, classically called coma vigil. Diarrhea may develop, but usually does not. Many patients develop hepatosplenomegaly (both liver and spleen enlarged). After the 1st week or so, many cases develop a maculopapular rash on the upper abdomen. These lesions ("rose spots") are about 2 cm in diameter and blanch on pressure. They persist for 2-4 days and may come and go. Mild and atypical infections are common.

The word typhoid (as in typhus-like) reflects the similarity of the louse-borne rickettsial disease epidemic typhus and that of typhoid fever; in fact, in some areas typhoid fever is still referred to as abdominal typhus

Regarding typhoid immunization, an important report has been published recently (28 Sep 2017) in Lancet: Jin C, Gibani MM, Moore M, et al: Efficacy and immunogenicity of a Vi-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine in the prevention of typhoid fever using a controlled human infection model of _Salmonella_ Typhi: a randomised controlled, phase 2b trial. Lancet. 2017. pii: S0140-6736(17)32149-9. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32149-9. [Epub ahead of print], available at: http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32149-9.pdf.

An excellent accompanying editorial (Feasey NA and Levine MM: Typhoid vaccine development with a human challenge model. Lancet. 2017. pii: S0140-6736(17)32407-8. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32407-8. [Epub ahead of print], available at:
http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(17)32407-8.pdf) is reproduced below (the references cited can be found at the original URL):

"Experimental human typhoid fever challenge was first described in 1896 by Wright, who vaccinated 2 men against typhoid fever and challenged one with what was then known as _Salmonella typhosa_ [1]. While challenge models are sometimes controversial, they offer enormous potential to study the pathogenesis of disease and to accelerate vaccine development, particularly in human-restricted pathogens such as _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi. The Maryland typhoid human challenge model, which ran from 1952 to 1974, led to insights into typhoid fever and facilitated the development of live attenuated typhoid vaccine Ty21a [2, 3]. A 21st-century typhoid challenge model has been developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group [4].

"In The Lancet, Celina Jin and colleagues [5] report results from challenging 3 groups of healthy adults from Oxford, UK, who were randomly assigned to receive Vi-conjugate vaccine, unconjugated Vi-polysaccharide vaccine, or control vaccine (ACYW135 meningococcal conjugate) with wild-type Quailes strain _S._ Typhi. Results of this volunteer challenge have been awaited with much anticipation by the public health community interested in control of typhoid fever in endemic areas of south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where _S._ Typhi is increasingly antibiotic resistant and few treatment options remain. Vi-conjugate vaccines that have been in development represent a new instrument to help to control typhoid. The most advanced conjugate vaccine, Typbar-TCV (Vi-polysaccharide [Vi-PS] conjugated to tetanus toxoid, Vi-TT, Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad, India), is licensed in India where it has been shown to elicit robust serum Vi antibody responses after only 1 dose, even in Indian infants as young as 6 months [6]. In toddlers, older children, and adults, Typbar-TCV was shown to be significantly more immunogenic than the unconjugated Bharat Vi-PS [6]. Bharat Biotech has submitted an application to WHO for pre-qualification of their Vi-TT. If approved, this would allow the vaccine to be procured by UN agencies. However, despite evidence of safety and immunogenicity in Indian children and adults, heretofore, there has been no evidence of actual efficacy of the vaccine in diminishing the attack rate of typhoid fever upon exposure to virulent _S._ Typhi compared with the control participants. Importantly, the authors provide the first data documenting that Typbar-TCV is protective.

"A total of 112 participants were enrolled in this observer and participant-blinded, randomised controlled trial, which showed that the Vi-TT is well tolerated, achieved 100 percent seroconversion of Vi antibody (versus 89 percent for Vi-PS), and stimulated significantly higher geometric mean titres than did unconjugated Vi-PS. Most importantly, Jin and colleagues document that Vi-TT recipients had a significantly lower attack rate for the primary aim endpoint diagnosing typhoid fever than control recipients. With the primary endpoint used in this ambitious trial, the attack rate for typhoid diagnosis was 24 (77 percent) of 31 in control participants, 13 (35 percent) of 37 in Vi-TT recipients, and 13 (35 percent) of 35 in those who received Vi-PS. This translates into vaccine efficacies of 54.6 percent (95 percent CI 26.8-71.8) for Vi-TT and 52.0 percent (23.2-70.0) for Vi-PS.

"As the authors suggest, the field efficacy of Vi-TT vaccine might be higher; for example, a well designed and executed field trial of an unlicensed Vi-conjugate produced by the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) in Vietnamese pre-school children showed an efficacy of 89 percent (95 percent CI 76-97) over 46 months of follow-up. [7] One possible explanation lies in the primary endpoint of so-called typhoid infection used by Jin and colleagues [5] (persistent fever of 38 deg C or higher for 12 hours or longer or _S._ Typhi bacteremia), which arguably is better suited to studying typhoid pathogenesis than assessing the efficacy of typhoid vaccines. Using slightly different endpoints such as fever 38 deg C or higher followed by a positive blood culture, similar to surveillance in a field trial and to endpoints used in the Maryland challenge model, Jin and colleagues [5] report that the efficacy of Vi-TT was 87.1 percent (95 percent CI 47.2-96.9), while efficacy of Vi-PS was 52.3 percent (-4.2 to 78.2). Although future typhoid challenges based on this as a co-primary endpoint would require larger sample sizes, the information gained might be more relevant and predictive of the efficacy that might be noted in a randomised controlled field trial. This highlights the need for the phase 3 and 4 trials, the first of which is expected to be initiated in Asia in late 2017 by the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC), a partnership between the University of Maryland, the University of Oxford, and PATH funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. However, because it will be some years before these field trials are reported, Jin and colleagues' challenge study results are timely and engender optimism that an effective new instrument has become available to help to control typhoid in hyperendemic populations." - Mod.LL
