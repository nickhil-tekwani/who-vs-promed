Georgia is seeing a spike in swine flu [influenza pandemic (H1N1)
virus infection] hospitalizations, having the most in the country for
3 weeks in a row, federal health officials said Monday [29 Mar 2010].
It is too early to say whether Georgia or the country are seeing
another wave of the illness, which had diminished across the nation
for several months, the officials said.

But the number of people being hospitalized in Georgia equals the
number of pandemic (H1N1) hospitalizations when the disease peaked
here last September [2009]. Officials stressed that no other state is
seeing such an increase. In the 1st 2 weeks of March [2010], Georgia
had 80 and 72 hospitalizations respectively, according to the state
Department of Community Health. In contrast, the 1st week of February
2010 saw 17 hospitalizations.

The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] was
so concerned about the Georgia situation that it sent a team of
researchers to investigate. CDC officials held a news conference
Monday [29 Mar 2010] that focused on the Georgia problem. Georgia's
increase is reflected to some degree in other southeastern states but
not in other parts of the country, she said. She described the illness
as "circulating intensely" here.

Georgia has one of the lowest immunization rates for pandemic (H1N1)
influenza, Schuchat said. State officials point out that the state's
immunization rate for children, however, is above average for the
country. "Most of the hospitalizations that we've seen have occurred
in ... adults with underlying conditions that put them at higher risks
of severe influenza," Schuchat said. Underlying conditions include
diabetes and heart disease.

The state health department, as well as county health departments,
have been boosting their efforts to get people vaccinated, stressing
that there is still an abundance of free vaccine. Last month [February
2010], the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Georgia had more
than 2.5 million doses of swine flu vaccine left. Less than 1/3rd of
Georgia's total allocation of 3.5 million doses -- 978 092 doses --
had been administered, according to the state. The problem has been
one of timing. Essentially, by the time the vaccine was widely
available, the flu -- and public interest -- had peaked. Neither
Georgia nor the nation is seeing a significant increase in swine
flu-related deaths, and there is no indication the virus has mutated
into a more dangerous form, officials said

Pandemic (H1N1) influenza first appeared last April [2009] and has
hospitalized 1012 Georgians and killed 60.

[It would be interesting to compare the demographics of the population
of the state of Georgia with those of other states to determine
whether there are any age-related factors which might be responsible
for the current spike in hospitalizations in the state.
