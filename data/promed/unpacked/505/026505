Anthrax kills five people in western Zambia
-----------------------------------------------------------
LUSAKA, Nov 8, 2002 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Five people and twenty herds of
cattle have died from anthrax in Sesheke District in western Zambia, where a
livestock movement and slaughter ban has been imposed with immediate
effect, according to a Zambia News Agency report Friday. The report quoted
the health authorities and veterinary officers in Sesheke, which is on the
border with Namibia, as saying that two more people are admitted to a local
hospital nursing sores which are typical characteristics of anthrax.
Veterinary officers in Sesheke cited the most affected areas as Muyatwac
village in Simungoma, where eight herds of cattle [died or were affected
with some deaths? MHJ] and three people died in one week, and three more are
sick at home.
However, Maondo area in the district has experienced rampant cattle deaths,
but livestock experts could not establish the exact mortality figure.
Meanwhile, the district veterinary officer, Dr. Webster Chikampa, has
imposed a livestock slaughter and movement ban in Sesheke because of the
anthrax outbreak, and the notice advised the anti-stock theft team of the
Zambia police service to clear only animals which have valid anthrax
vaccination documents.
[This affected area is down river (Zambezi) from prior outbreaks near Mongu
and Senanga of previous years. If it is as severe and widespread in the area
as this report would indicate, we may expect that the adjoining area of the
Caprivi Strip south of Sesheke will also be affected. I have asked
colleagues in Zambia for information on the probable true extent of these
outbreaks. 100% death rates in livestock is unusual unless in its epidemic
form involving horse flies or contaminated water, or we are considering
small herds of only a few animals. When the word "rampant" is used, one must
suspect the worst. I hope I am wrong. The area affected in Zambia is well
away from the reported Mashonaland outbreaks in NE Zimbabwe. - Mod.MHJ]
