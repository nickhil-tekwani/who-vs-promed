Health officials said there could be a possible outbreak of the
respiratory illness Legionnaires' disease at a Cudahy hospital. So
far, at least 8 people have come down with the illness. Of the 8
cases, 6 had some contact with Aurora Saint Luke's South Shore
Hospital, 5900 S. Lake Drive.

The disease causes symptoms similar to pneumonia, and is treatable
with antibiotics. The illness 1st received wide attention in 1976,
when an outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia
killed 34 people -- hence the name. Milwaukee County usually sees
just one or 2 cases of Legionnaires' a month. Health experts said
once news spreads about such a cluster, it's common that others will
go to doctors to get diagnosed. They also said the outbreak appears
to be isolated to just one hospital.

Aurora said its doctors routinely report cases of Legionnaires'
disease to state health officials. Those officials then start their
investigation. "When they see that cluster, they begin their
investigation of 'where are these people from, where do they shop,
where do they go to church?' -- all those kinds of questions to try
and trace back to see if there's a source for the infection," said
Doctor Bruce Van Cleave of Aurora Health Care. "Six of them, in these
in-depth interviews, said they were here at St. Luke's South Shore
Hospital. We want to make sure that other people who may have been
here get notified."

Aurora is notifying the more than 1000 patients who were at St.
Luke's South Shore between 24 Feb 2010 and 10 Mar 2010. Those people
are being told to call their doctors if they're experiencing cold or
flu-like symptoms. Aurora said it's safe to go back to St. Luke's
South Shore. State health officials have toured and tested the
facility and declared it safe.

"It usually comes from something in the environment that's creating
mists that carry the germ. So in our look at the facility, we've
identified different places where mists might be generated and we
shut them down," said Dr. Seth Foldy, a state health officer. "And
that's why we feel comfortable saying people can feel secure in the
building moving forward."

Legionnaires' disease is not contagious. To contract it, one would
have to have direct contact with the contaminated water vapor. Foldy
said everything from plant misters to hot tubs to respiratory
equipment could cause tainted mists. Officials are continuing to investigate.

[The following has been extracted from ProMED Mod.ML's comments in a
prior ProMED post, Legionellosis, neonatal, nosocomial, fatal -
Cyprus: susp. 20090102.0011:

"Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_ bacteria, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About
80-90 percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immuno-suppression.
Pediatric cases of Legionnaires' disease are uncommon.

"Usually a building's water system is incriminated as the source.
_Legionella_ are found primarily in the hot water portion of plumbing
systems and in cooling towers. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C
(77-104 deg F) support the highest concentrations of the organism in
plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are embedded in a biofilm
that lines the inner walls of the plumbing system's pipes and
containers. Concentrations of the organism in the water can be
increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious aerosols can
be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning systems, shower
heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

"Elimination or reduction of legionella colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>." Genotyping
bacteria has become a helpful tool in hospital epidemiology to
establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype in
patient specimens suggests transmission from a common source. Because
_L. pneumophila_ may be found in water supplies without history of
any cases, the actual causative, infectious reservoir should be
demonstrated by means of genotyping methods to assure frequently
costly corrective measures are carried out on the actual source
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/>; and
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/>).

Cudahy is a small town, 2 miles south of the city limits of
Milwaukee, the largest city in the state of Wisconsin, USA. The
Cudahy population was 18 429 at the 2000 census
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cudahy,_Wisconsin>). A map showing the
location of Aurora Saint Luke's South Shore Hospital in Cudahy can be
