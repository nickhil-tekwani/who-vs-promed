At least 11 people in northwestern China have contracted anthrax, usually found in domestic and wild animals.

The government in Ganquan county near Yan'an in Shaanxi province said in a statement that the people may have caught the illness through contact with infected animals or animal products.

15 animals have died of the illness, according to the report published on the government's website.

The statement did not comment on the condition of the people infected.

The common form of anthrax can result in blisters and ulcers on the skin and is treatable, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

The illness is usually spread by infected animals and person-to-person infection is rare, the World Health Organisation said on its website.

The provincial authorities in Shaanxi have launched measures to control the spread of the illness.

[Our thanks to Dan for finding this report.

The report does not specify the animal species and/or the animal product involved. Anthrax usually does not spread directly from an infected animal or person to another; rather, it is spread by spores. Humans may get infected through the digestive or -- less frequently -- respiratory route from infected animals. In case of the latter, consequences are worse.

Information on the identity of the "animals" is requested.

Shaanxi province is a part of the Northwest China Region; see map at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaanxi#/media/File:Shaanxi_in_China_(%2Ball_claims_hatched).svg.

According to Mod.MHJ's commentary accompanying the previous report on anthrax in the province Shaanxi, late Sep 2006 (see 20061002.2822), the number of human cases during earlier years was as follows: 2000 (594), 2001(824), 2002 (783), 2003 (602), and 2004 (610).

The figures from 2005 onwards, as available on OIE's WAHID data base (launched 2005), show continued trend of decrease, as follows:
2005 (532 cases, 12 deaths), 2006 (451, 12), 2007 (421, 1), 2008 ( 336, 10), 2009 (351, 3), 2010 (289, 6), 2011 (309, 3) and 2012 (237, 1).
(Later data not yet available).

In the last available semi-annual report from China to the OIE (Jan - Jun 2014), China reported 9 new anthrax outbreaks in animals, namely in cattle and pigs, as follows:
Bovines - out of 83 susceptible animals: 18 cases, 7 deaths, 11 destroyed, 74 ring vaccinated.
Porcines - out of 447 susceptible animals, 9 cases, 4 deaths, 5 destroyed, 421 ring vaccinated.

It will be interesting to note whether China's anthrax vaccinations of the animals kept on the infected premises prescribed repeated vaccinations of all animals of the holding in subsequent years and, in case confirmed, for how many years. - Mod.AS]
