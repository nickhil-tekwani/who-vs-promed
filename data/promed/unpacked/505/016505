The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) is calling for dogs that are exposed to the Ebola virus in countries that are not endemic for the disease to be tested and quarantined rather than be automatically euthanased. The call follows the euthanasia of the pet dog belonging to a Spanish health worker who was infected by the virus after caring for a missionary who died from Ebola.

The WSAVA reports that the dog was euthanased against the health worker's wishes on 8 Oct 2014 on the orders of the Spanish government. The Madrid regional government obtained a court order to euthanase the dog, claiming that "available scientific information" could not rule out "a risk of contagion". The WSAVA says that quarantine was not considered as an alternative. People who have come into contact with the health worker have been placed in quarantine.

"While it is possible that dogs may harbour the virus, particularly in endemic areas where they may have access to infected animal carcasses, domestic pets, potentially exposed in developed countries, represent a very different scenario," said Shane Ryan, chair of the WSAVA's animal wellness and welfare committee. "A precedent for automatic euthanasia is both unnecessary and a significant breach of animal welfare. The dog in question was not tested for the virus, and it is our view that available technology should allow for testing and quarantine as the 1st line response."

Michael Day, chairman of the WSAVA's One Health committee, added: "Zoonotic diseases, particularly those transmitted through pets, are concerning to the pet-owning public, but there have been no scientific reports indicating that Ebola virus has been isolated from or directly transmitted by dogs. One investigation has shown that dogs may develop antibody to Ebola virus consistent with exposure, but dogs do not develop any symptoms of the disease. As the virus spreads into more developed regions, we are likely to see increasing concern and media interest as to the role of dogs in the transmission of disease, and, as a profession, we must respond to pressure to euthanase pets as the exposure levels increase and fear escalates."

Meanwhile, the BVA and BSAVA have issued a press statement on Ebola virus and dogs, while also making information available to their members. The press statement, issued on 14 Oct 2014, emphasized that while there is evidence that dogs seroconvert and produce antibodies to the Ebola virus without showing clinical signs of the disease, the role of dogs, if any, in the transmission of the virus is not known.

"It would appear that the main route of transmission is human-to-human contact and that bodily fluids coming from infected people are highly infectious," the 2 organisations said. "As dogs may have contact with these fluids, it would be a sensible precaution to take great care when handling dogs in the face of an outbreak. If the dog has been in contact with a known infected person, the dog should be placed in strict isolation where they can be monitored until they pose no risk."

The information sent to BVA and BSAVA members offers similar advice, while also giving details of sources of further information about Ebola virus and dogs.

Among these is an article by J Scott Weese, published in the October [2014] issue of Clinicians' Brief, the official publication of the North American Veterinary Community. In the article, Dr Weese notes that the evidence that dogs can be infected with Ebola virus came from a study in a community where an Ebola virus outbreak was under way (Allela and others. Ebola virus antibody prevalence in dogs and human risk. Emerg Infect Dis. 2005; 11:385-390) [abstract in commentary of posting 20141012.2856328]. More than a quarter of healthy dogs had serum antibodies against the virus, but none had detectable virus in circulation. "Evidence of exposure was not surprising, as some dogs scavenged the bodies of animals that had potentially died of Ebola virus infection and had direct contact with humans with active disease," Dr Weese writes. This situation, he comments, is "profoundly different" from that of a household pet with transient exposure to a person who has been exposed or who has early infection.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has also reviewed current knowledge on Ebola virus and has issued a technical information sheet discussing the virus and the disease. The information sheet [available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Ebola_fact_sheet_EN_Final.pdf; excerpts in posting 20141010.2851028] considers the pathogenesis, occurrence, and natural hosts of the virus, as well as its transmission to people and the disease it causes. The OIE is encouraging veterinary services in affected countries to remain vigilant and to develop their involvement towards wildlife.

[Prior to the publications mentioned in the above review, we received the following question from a reader:

"Are dogs likely to become infected in the same way as humans -- for example, less likely if only exposed to mild symptoms of infection in their human contact? So maybe a timeline could be drawn on when to and when not to euthanize, depending on the symptoms of the human contact?" - Mod.AS]

I am attempting by this note to add something in general to our understanding of the Ebola virus epidemic and questions related to the possible role of dogs in the spread of disease, hopefully reducing some of the attendant tensions associated with the issue.

I have no direct experience or expertise with Ebola virus but have had extensive experience with Rabbit Calicivirus (RCV). Prior to its release for rabbit control in Australia in the mid-1990's, a wide range of domestic animals and wildlife were challenged by intramuscular inoculation with a significant dose of RCV, with no evidence of disease or seroconversion. Anecdotally, subsequent to the RCV pandemic which occurred, a range of predator/scavenger animals were found to have comparatively low-positive antibody levels.

The conclusion was that non-target species were eating infected material, with antigen passing into their systems via oral abrasions, tonsils etc. These animals were then stimulated to produce an antibody response, processing the virus as antigen without ever having had a productive virus infection.

An analogous situation could have occurred with the Ebola disease outbreak in which scavenging dogs were found to be seropositive. Equally in this situation, scavenging rodents and birds might also have tested positive had they been examined.

To ultimately "prove" that an animal is carrying a productive infection would be very difficult in a heavily contaminated environment. PCR, because of its sensitivity, could easily yield a false positive under these circumstances. So might virus isolation, unless proper procedures were strictly adhered to.

Immunohistochemistry of target tissues might be considered, if specific reagents are available. Always, we need to be aware of the severe risks associated with detailed investigation of Ebola virus disease.
