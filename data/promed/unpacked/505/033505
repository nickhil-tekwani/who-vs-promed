----------------------------------------------------------------------
The incidence of Lyme disease in New York State has changed little over the years, in contrast to increasing incidence reported on a national level. [1,2] See graph at http://cdn.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/LymeUSvNY1.bmp

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Berger for his continuing contributions.

While the number of new confirmed cases in the US as a whole fluctuated from 21 273 in 2003 to a peak of almost 30 000 cases in 2009, to fall to 22 561 cases in 2010, rise the next year to 24 364 cases in 2011 and fall again to 22 014 cases in 2012, the number of new confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in New York State, which fluctuated from 5399 cases in 2003 to a low of 4165 cases in 2007, only to rise again to 5741 cases in 2008, has indeed mostly fallen every year since 2008 to 2044 cases in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html).

However, Lyme disease is not evenly distributed across New York State. It is concentrated in several southern counties, such as Dutchess, Westchester, and Suffolk Counties (http://www.cdc.gov/Lyme/stats/), and there are likely "hotspots" for Lyme disease within these counties. The incidence is likely higher than reported in the Hamptons, because this beach community in Suffolk County has a population of transient renters during the warmer summer months and diseases are reported by county of residence, rather than where the disease was actually acquired. Under-reporting is thus likely to occur in a highly endemic area of summer rentals like the Hamptons, whereas over-reporting may occur in non-endemic areas.

The Hamptons is a group of villages in the towns of Southampton and East Hampton, which form the South Fork of Suffolk County, Long Island in New York State (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hamptons). Long Island may be found on the interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2645353,40685. - Mod.ML]
