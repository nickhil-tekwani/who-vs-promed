Mumps outbreak on University of California at Berkeley campus
-------------------------------------------------------------
At least 7 mumps cases have been confirmed at the University of
California [UC] at Berkeley, according to reports on Thursday [6 Oct
2011].

Mumps is a disease generally associated with small children and causes
fever, aches, weakness, and headaches. It is spread via saliva or
mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat.

Cases of mumps at the campus have risen sharply in the past week after
it was first discovered in 4 people on Friday [30 Sep 2011]. "There
hasn't been an outbreak in at least 5 years," Kim LaPean, a
spokesperson with Berkeley's health center, told The San Francisco
Chronicle. There are 13 more suspected cases.

According to an alert sent out by the university, school officials are
working with the state "to limit (the) spread of the disease,"
according to the CBS-5 television station.
