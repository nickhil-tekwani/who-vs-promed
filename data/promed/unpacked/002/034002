Saskatchewan's Ministry of Agriculture says 7 farm animals are dead due to anthrax. The province says the case was confirmed in the RM of Golden West located approximately 140 kilometres [about 87 mi] southeast of Regina [The Provincial Ministry of Agriculture has since issued a correction -- the outbreak is in Chester, not Golden West; see https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2019/august/29/anthrax. - Mod.MHJ]. It says lab results from [Thu 29 Aug 2019] confirmed anthrax caused the sudden death of 7 animals. Dr Betty Althouse, the ministry's chief veterinary officer, says the animals were farmed livestock.

She says the last cases of animal anthrax that resulted in death occurred in 2015. Althouse says there have been a few other suspected cases of anthrax throughout the summer, but all of them turned out negative. "We do suspect anthrax in the summer on pasture when there's sudden deaths in animals. It is important to get a veterinary diagnosis to confirm whether it is or not, so this is the first case that was confirmed."

Anthrax is caused by a bacterium that can survive for decades as spores in soil. The province is warning farmers to be on the lookout for anthrax as changes in soil moisture from flooding or drying can cause spores to build up on pastures. The ministry say animals are more at risk of being exposed to anthrax in drier years. Althouse says the livestock that died were grazing in a slough on a pasture.

She adds the veterinarian dealing with the herd is considering whether to relocate the rest of the animals off the contaminated pasture. A short-term treatment may also be needed.

The province says animal cases pose little risk to humans, but people can become infected through direct contact with sick animals or their carcasses. Anthrax can be prevented through vaccination, Saskatchewan notes. Althouse says couldn't confirm whether or not the livestock that died were vaccinated.

For a summary of the severe epidemic in 2006 affecting 153 herds, go to 24 Sep 2006 Anthrax - Canada (SK, MB)(12) 20060924.2728 and recovery in 2007 14 Jun 2007 Anthrax, bovine - Canada (SK) (03) 20070614.1946; 2008 29 Aug 2008 Anthrax, bovine - Canada (05): (SK) 20080829.2710; and 2009 30 Jul 2009 Anthrax, bovine - Canada (04): (MB, SK) 20090730.2674.

There was a severe epidemic in 2006 affecting the whole province with 153 ranches affected, involving 493 cattle, 254 farmed bison, 35 sheep and goats, 6 horses, and 3 pigs. These was a significant and effective vaccination response involving 400 000 cattle. As a result there were only 6 outbreaks in 2007 with 14 cattle affected and 1403 vaccinated; in 2008, 3 outbreaks, 14 cattle affected, and 780 vaccinated; and in 2009, 2 outbreaks, 18 head affected, and 736 vaccinated. There were sporadic outbreaks in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, and 2015. The provincial veterinary service has an active programme to maintain awareness of this disease, to report unexpected deaths, and the real need for the ranch owners to vaccinate their stock each spring. And they are successful. In a dry summer the moisture in a slough maintains green grazing and attracts animals. This can put animals at risk if in previous years an animal has died of anthrax in this slough contaminating the soil, and the spores will lurk there and can in certain circumstances germinate and multiply in the root mass of this grazing. Which is why it is so important to vaccinate your cattle each spring. - Mod.MHJ
