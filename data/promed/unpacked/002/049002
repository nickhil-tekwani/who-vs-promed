[1] Cholera - Tanzania (Zanzibar)

At least 4 people have died of cholera in the past week on Tanzania's
Zanzibar archipelago, officials said, announcing the creation of a task
force to fight the disease. In addition to the deaths -- 3 last week on the
island of Pemba and 1 this week on the main island of Unguja -- more than
120 Zanzibaris have been sickened with cholera symptoms, health minister
Sultan Mohamed Mugheiry said.
He said 2 special health facilities had been set up to deal with the
illness, which appears to be spreading, but urged islanders to improve
their hygiene and ensure that water they use for cooking or drinking is clean.
"The most important prevention is for people to observe hygiene," Mugheiry
told reporters at a news conference, warning that he would order the
closure of schools, restaurants and other facilities that do not meet
health standards. He said a preliminary investigation had shown the
outbreak was the result of a lack of proper toilets, including in schools
on Pemba, and the use of contaminated water despite repeated appeals for
water to be boiled.
Cholera has repeatedly hit Zanzibar in recent years, with the last severe
outbreak recorded in 1997 when more than 1100 people were taken ill by the
disease, at least 124 of whom died.

Eight people have died out of the 26 recorded cases of cholera in the last
7 days in Ndalatando, northern Kwanza-Norte Province, in the sequence of
the disease that has been hitting this region. According to Kwanza Norte`s
provincial hospital director, Caetano Jose Miguel, the 26 cases were
registered in Sambizanga and 11 de Novembro wards, with the dead being
mostly children 9 years old or younger.
Caetano Jose said that the Health Provincial Board, through its disease
control department, is engaged in the evaluation of deaths that occur in
the township, to identify if the deaths are being caused by cholera. The
health provincial administration is appealing to the population to follow
preventive measures to protect themselves from the disease, such as basic
sanitation in the area, cleaning toilets, boiling water or disinfecting the
water before drinking it, among other measures.

90 new cases of cholera, without any deaths, were registered in the last 24
hours, in Luanda, adding to 1038, since 13 Feb 2006, date of the disease
outbreak in the province.
The information was given by the Health Luanda provincial director, Vita
Vemba, stating that the illness already caused 23 deaths, representing a
mortality rate of 2 per cent.
About the spread of the disease in every municipality, Vita Vemba said that
it is due to basic sanitation problems, lack of toilets in some areas, and
low water quality, aggravated by the lack of water distribution network in
most parts of the city.

[7] Cholera - Uganda (Moyo)

Moyo district has been hit by the less common cholera subtype Inaba, the
commissioner for community health, Dr Sam Okware, has said. He said Inaba
has killed 3 people in the district.
Okware said on Thu, 23 Mar 2006, "There is a big problem in Sudan. This
rare subtype could have been imported from there because there is already a
severe cholera epidemic."
Earlier reports indicated that a cholera-like disease had hit the district
with over 20 people admitted to Obongi health center in critical condition.
At least 5 people were being admitted every day with mild diarrhea.
However, Okware said samples tested from Kampala showed Inaba, a milder
type compared to the typical cholera. "With Inaba, the diarrhea is not as
intensive as in the common cholera. It (diarrhea) is mild and patients tend
to improve faster, hence not a serious danger," Okware said.

[The flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are shared with many water
vibrios and therefore are of no use in distinguishing strains causing
epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains
of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of
_V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal strain
(which is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible
for epidemic cholera.
However, there are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and
Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype.
The Bengal strain (O139) is a new serological strain with a unique O
antigen, which partly explains the lack of residual immunity.
