Hepatitis E is a virus-induced liver inflammation, which is relatively
rare in Germany. Until now, it has been assumed that human cases in
Germany were mostly a result of travels to Asia and Africa, where this
disease is more common.

Recent studies by the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and
other research institutes indicate that, on average, 15 percent of
wild boars hunted in Germany carry the hepatitis E virus. However, it
is not clear so far whether these viruses can be transmitted directly
to humans.

For protection from infection with the hepatitis E virus, BfR
recommends that consumers such as hunters should strictly keep
sanitary conditions during carving up and that the meat should always
be properly cooked before consumption. BfR has compiled a collection
of consumer advice on kitchen hygiene.
