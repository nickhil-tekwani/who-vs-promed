[The Tambov regional administration of Rospotrebnadzor (Territorial
Directorate of the Federal Services for Consumer Protection and Human
Welfare) communicated to IA Regnum that local authorities] had
started an investigation in connection with the infection with
scabies of more than 10 healthcare workers.
The infections occurred in the 3rd municipal hospital, which serves
as a base for emergency care. A woman who died in the hospital
because of pulmonary complications on 13 Jul 2007, was infected
[according to unofficial reports] by Norwegian scabies, a disease,
which is caused by the [scabies mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_.]
This disease occurs usually in weak and emaciated people, in patients
with TB or HIV and in patients receiving steroids and cytostatics. A
polymorphic eruption is typical for Norwegian scabies (papules,
vesicles, pustules, chaps).
The crusts contain huge amounts of parasites in different stages of
development (up to 200 in 1 sq. cm). It is assumed that the woman
admitted from a village was the source of infection in the hospital.
The quarantine was announced from 16 Jul 2007, and anti-epidemic
treatment of the rooms and of personnel is under way.

[Norwegian scabies is a rare disease and there are singular cases of
it recorded in history. This report is not an official one and the
diagnosis may not be reliable. - Mod.NR
Norwegian scabies is a well-known but rare disease usually seen in
immunocompromised patients. It is easily treated with a single dose
of ivermection, which is also the drug of choice in accidentally
infected health care workers. - Mod.EP
[From ProMED: Scabies outbreak in SFO 19941219.0154
"This just overheard on Performance Today on National Public Radio: there has
been an outbreak of scabies in members of the San Francisco Orchestra.
Anyone have any details? Are orchestras a high risk group? Do the mites
hide out in the chin pads the violinists use? Does the string section,
therefore, have a higher attack rate than the wind? What about chamber
groups? Marching bands? Jazz groups? Choirs? Are the mites attracted to
the supersonic or subsonic harmonics? Where does one go to apply for a
research grant on this?" - Mod.JW
