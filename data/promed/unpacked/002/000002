A team from the Ministry of Agriculture's department of Animal Health and Production spent the past 2 weeks identifying bee farms in Ba [Western Division] affected by the American Foulbrood (AFB) disease.

Director Tomasi Tunabuna confirmed the team was surveying the affected farms.

"The team has been able to identify a number of affected farms in the Ba district," he said.

"We have a strategy in place for the removal of infected hives.

"The team has been doing these surveys and we should be able to cover all of the suspected areas in the next 2 weeks [3-17 Aug 2013]."

Mr Tunabuna said the government would assist affected farmers. "We are also trying to assist those who have been affected by the removal of the beehives.

"We help them find ways to recover from the losses they incurred during the removal of their beehives."

The director said a hive infected with AFB was a hazard to all hives in surrounding areas for a distance of about 2 kilometres [about 1.2 miles].

"Burning and burial of infected hives are the most effective ways of removing this hazard. If discovered early, a farmer may only lose 1 or 2 hives, but if left alone he may lose all of them and perhaps spread the disease to neighbouring farms."

Mr Tunabuna said the bacterium killed honey bee larvae in brood cells.

"Typically, in infected hives, the colony has a mottled look due to empty cells. There may be a typical smell and the brood has a characteristically slimy or ropey appearance. AFB is spread by bacterial spores formed in infected larvae which are very resistant and survive many years.

"The disease is spread by transfer of wax of queens in exchange of combs, by contaminated honey or contaminated equipment, and is often spread by the bees themselves when they rob honey from infected hives."

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to cause American foulbrood, a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. _P. larvae_ spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae, leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
