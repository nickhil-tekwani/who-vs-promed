From: LUIZ JACINTHO DA SILVA <ljacinth@saude.sp.gov.br>

These are confirmed cases, positive for Sin Nombre. The epidemiological
investigation is being undertaken. Both patients had been husking corn
recently. The previous two cases occurring this year in Sao Paulo were in
a different region, albeit with similar geographical and ecological
aspects. A search for rodents in the farm where the cases occurred brought
only _Rattus_ sp and _Mus_ sp. Three specimens were positive to Andes
virus, an Argentinean hantavirus.

[We are assuming that "positive for Sin Nombre" and "positive to Andes
virus" indicate serologic results and do not indicate the etiologic agent.
