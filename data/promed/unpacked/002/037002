Viet Nam: Sequence Variation of Isolates from Southern Region
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam's Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute discovered that the
avian H5N1 influenza in the country has mutated into a more dangerous
version, according to the local newspaper Youth. The daily reported
on Sat 12 Nov 2005 that results of the Institute's research on 24
virus samples from infected poultry and people in the southern region
between December 2003 and March 2005 show there are some changes in
gene segments coding for the surface antigens HA and NA and some
other gene segments of the H5N1 virus in Viet Nam in early 2005. The
changes indicate that the virus has been mutating to reproduce
effectively in cells of mammals and increase its attacking
capability. All the viruses researched by the institute in southern
Ho Chi Minh City are resistant to the 2 antiviral medicine agents
Amantadine and Rimantadine.
The Institute has decoded completely or partly genes of 24 virus
samples. 5 samples from humans and 16 from fowl have been decoded
completely. However, the institute has been unable to define which
kinds of mutations allow human-to-human transmission, and which
conditions lead to the mutations.
Up to 92 Vietnamese people from 32 cities and provinces have been
infected with bird flu virus strain H5N1 since the disease started to
appear in the country in late 2003, according to the Vietnamese
Ministry of Health. The World Health Organization, on 9 Nov 2005,
confirmed a total of 125 human cases of bird flu infections,
including 64 deaths, in Southeast Asia since December 2003.

[Similar findings have been reported previously. It is not clear from
this press report whether experiments were conducted using
experimental animals to substantiate the statement that all the
viruses sequenced had enhanced ability to multiply effectively in the
cells of mammals. This does not necessarily equate with increased
ability to transmit from person-to-person. For a recent review and
discussion, see the Report of the WHO Writing Committee: New England

Indonesia: New suspected Human Case of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
An Indonesian women died of suspected avian influenza, a hospital
spokesman said on Sun 13 Nov 2005, adding that tests would be carried
out to confirm the cause of death. Dr. Ilham Patu said that "all the
indications" were that the 20-year-old woman had contracted the
virus. She died late on Saturday [12 Nov 2005] in Jakarta's
Infectious Diseases Hospital, where all suspected cases of bird flu
in the capital are treated, he said. Patu said the woman lived close
to a flock of backyard chickens that died suddenly. She had a high
fever and breathing difficulties when she died. Tests would be
carried out on Mon 14 Nov 2005 to confirm the diagnosis, he said.
Samples would also be sent to a Hong Kong laboratory for further
tests.
Bird flu is endemic in flocks across Indonesia and killed at least 5
humans this year [2005]. At least 64 people across Asia have died
after contracting the virus since 2003. Most of the people in Asia
infected with the H5N1 strain of bird flu have had contact with sick
birds. International health experts fear that if the virus mutates
into a form that is easily transmissible between people, it could
spark a pandemic, possibly killing millions.

no more than tentative. - Mod.CP]
