[A number of banana (_Musa_ species and hybrids) pathogens have been reported from the region, including, for example, _Banana bunchy top virus_, as well as the fungal diseases of black and yellow sigatoka (_Mycosphaerella_ species) and Panama disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_) including tropical race 4 (TR4). (For more information, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

Plantains are banana cultivars in the AAB subgroup (A for _M. acuminata_, B for _M. balbisiana_ genomic sets) of the genus that are usually cooked before eating. However, the term is also used for cooking bananas in other subgroups. Cooking may not be essential for a number of cultivars either, these are also edible uncooked when ripe.

Symptoms described above are not sufficient to speculate on the disease or disorder referred to. Reliable diagnosis is required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
