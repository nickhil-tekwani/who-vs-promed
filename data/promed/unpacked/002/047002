Ebola: the economic impact continues
------------------------------------
"At least 80 per cent of our reservations have been canceled," Ibrahima Capi Camara, general manager of the 217-room Grand Hotel de L'Independence in the heart of Conakry, said on 8 Apr 2014. "Clients are scared to come because of Ebola."

Measures such as closing borders and restricting travel "don't make sense," according to WHO, which says avoiding close contact with patients will help contain the spread of the disease. That hasn't stopped Senegal from shutting a border or Ivory Coast from barring buses from Liberia and Guinea. Rio de Janeiro-based Vale SA (VALE5), the world's biggest iron-ore producer, sent foreign workers in Guinea back to their homes last week [6-11 Apr 2014?].

"The extreme fear it provokes in populations means that local and regional businesses are already seeing disruption to operations," Charles Laurie, head of Africa research at risk consultant Maplecroft in Bath, England, said in an email. "Regional trade is at risk of grinding to a halt." The disease will curb economic growth in Liberia by slowing cross-border commerce, reducing customs revenue, and investment, finance minister Amara Konneh said in an interview yesterday [11 Apr 2014]. Gross domestic product will expand [only] 6.8 per cent this year, slower than the 8.7 per cent last year [2013], he said.

Mohamed Cherif Abdallah, head of the Organized Group of Businessmen in Conakry, said the outbreak is hurting the economy. "Guinean business owners are losing money because of this," he said by phone yesterday [10 Apr 2014]. "The disease has halted economic activity in the country's interior, and many foreigners are reluctant to come now." The Guinean region and towns of Gueckedou and Macenta where [Ebolavirus] was first detected last month [March 2014] produces most of the fruit and vegetables sold in the capital. "People claim that our bananas contain ebolavirus because they come from Gueckedou," a market vendor in Conakry, said in an interview. "For the past 2 weeks, I've had to throw all my bananas away. Business is dwindling."

[3] Gambia: flights banned
Date: Sat 12 Apr 2014

http://www.freedomnewspaper.com/Homepage/tabid/36/newsid367/9809/Jammeh-Ban-Flights-Coming-From-Liberia-Sierra-Leone-And-Guinea-From-Landing-In-Gambia-Following-Ebola-Outbreak/Default.aspx


Gambia's dictator Yahya Jammeh has ordered the banning of all flights coming from Guinea Conakry, Sierra Leone, and Liberia from landing at the Banjul International airport with immediate effect, the Freedom Newspaper can reveal. The decision followed the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the West African region. He said the decision to ban flights coming from the above-named countries was in line with Gambia's efforts to prevent its citizens from getting infected with the dreadful Ebola pandemic. Hundreds of passengers have been stranded across the West African region, following Jammeh's latest decree to ban airlines from landing in The Gambia.

Health Ministry officials and Banjul Aviation staff have confirmed the story. According to sources, many travelers have been compelled to travel by land through other countries as The Gambia Civil Aviation Management said they have been instructed by Jammeh to turn down flights coming from Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.

"The approach taken by Jammeh is wrong, says an official of the Ministry of Health. "We can fight Ebola without banning incoming flights." Even the minister of health is not happy with the decision. The airport is going to lose a lot of revenue in coming days and weeks because of Jammeh's decision," he warned.

In Liberia, it is reported that many passengers travelling to The Gambia have been stranded. One of the passengers told the Freedom Newspaper that he had to cancel his air ticket reservation because of Jammeh's decision to ban incoming flights.

[4] HealthMap: Ebola updates and an interview
Date: Fri 11 Apr 2014

http://www.healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/ebola-updates-and-interview-41114


Dr Thomas Yuill [TY], a moderator for ProMED-mail and professor emeritus in the Department of Pathobiological Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison spoke with me about the challenges that exist with the current [Ebolavirus] outbreak. Dr Yuill has a joint PhD in wildlife ecology and in veterinary science with a specialization in virology. He has worked throughout the world in the field of zoonoses.

AH: Are you aware of any challenges specific to the current outbreak?

TY: The thing that is most challenging about this outbreak is not only that it is in West Africa, where the virus had not previously been seen, but that it is in many different places including Guinea and Liberia, with suspect cases previously identified in Sierra Leone in people that had traveled from Guinea.

Another challenge that exists is catching up with contacts, as the population is spread out and highly mobile. In addition, some of the regions in Guinea did not have reliable maps available, however maps have since been provided so that health authorities are better able to find houses in these hot spot areas and may now begin going house-to-house to identify any missed cases and potential contacts. Tracking and identifying contacts to specific locations is a tremendous task for officials to complete.

Lastly, there is a lot of fear among locals, which is not surprising given the nature of the disease and the high case fatality rate.

AH: Do you think we will continue to see more cases as part of this outbreak, and what can health officials do at this point to stop the disease from continuing to spread?

TY: Authorities will be able to halt the current outbreak with good case finding and contact tracing practices. It is likely that more cases will be seen however, and getting this outbreak halted will not be easy and will take some time.

AH: Could you tell me more about why the reservoir for [ebolavirus] has not yet been confirmed?

TY: If [ebolavirus] is not highly prevalent in wildlife populations it will take an enormous effort, including costly field studies to track it down. If you are not in the right place at the right time one may not find it.

AH: Do you have any insight about the consumption of bushmeat in these countries, as that is a risk for disease transmission?

TY: The consumption of bushmeat is a well-established practice in many parts of Africa and it constitutes a significant amount of protein for many people as well as a source of income. The ban on bushmeat that has been placed by several countries will likely be extremely difficult to enforce.

AH: Any final thoughts on the ongoing Ebola outbreak?

TY: I think for all of us this has been a major wake-up call. These things can and do happen by surprise and then the challenge is to be ready for them when they occur to be able to respond quickly because the virus isn't going to wait for us to get organized.

Bushmeat safe to eat
--------------------
Officials in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have banned the sale of bushmeat in local markets in an effort to stop the spread of [ebolavirus]. Reuters reports that some specialists remain skeptical about the ban's effectiveness as many depend on bushmeat for protein and income. Further, some are not convinced that smoked or cooked bushmeat is a significant source of [ebolavirus] infection. In late March [2014], Reuters spoke with a virologist and hemorrhagic fever specialist, Bob Swanepoel, who stressed that filoviruses are transmitted by infected animals and "fresh carcasses" rather than cooked or smoked meat. -

[5] Survivors: immunity and transmission
Date: Fri 11 Apr 2014

How a person can recover from [Ebola virus disease]
---------------------------------------------------
Marie-Christine Ferir, Brussels-based emergency coordinator for Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF; doctors without borders], says a person's blood may be free of Ebola, but the virus can persist in semen for 2-3 months after recovery. (That's because antibodies produced in the bloodstream don't reach the testicles.) Since Ebolavirus can be transmitted through sexual contact, male survivors are sent home with condoms and instructed to use them for the next 3 months if they engage in intercourse. The virus can also linger in breast milk, so mothers are told to wean any child who had been breastfeeding.

Ebola survivors do not have to worry about contracting the disease again, says Pierre Rollin, deputy director of the viral special pathogens branch of CDC, who has traveled to the site of previous Ebola epidemics over the past 20 years. "When they start to test negative, they're going to remain negative for the rest of their lives."

Mental health is another matter. Health care workers often check on patients in their homes to see how they are faring after the trauma of suffering through Ebola -- and perhaps losing family members to the disease as well. They must also deal with the stigma associated with having had the virus. Health workers teach the community that the Ebola survivor cannot infect them. "They will do a lot of things, especially holding hands with [the patients], to publicly demonstrate that they're not afraid of these people," says Knust. Adds Ferir: "[In the past] we would bring the patient into the middle of the village, and we would give a big kiss to the patient to show that it's OK, no problem."
