The Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW) has confirmed that 2 legally
harvested bull moose from northern Colorado have tested positive for
chronic wasting disease (CWD).
A moose killed in game management unit (GMU) 7, a few miles southeast
of Glendevey, was the 2nd CWD-positive moose diagnosed in Colorado in
2006. This moose was harvested and submitted for testing in October
2006. This unit is northeast of the unit where Colorado's 1st
positive moose was harvested in 2005. Another moose harvested from
GMU 6 in October also tested positive; this unit is within the same
population unit as the 2005 case.
CWD is a fatal neurological disease that has been diagnosed in wild
deer and elk in 10 states and 2 Canadian provinces. Animals show no
apparent signs of illness throughout much of the disease course. In
terminal stages of CWD, animals typically are emaciated and display
abnormal behavior.
CWD was diagnosed in testing completed by the Colorado State
University Veterinary Diagnostic lab. CWD testing for moose was made
mandatory in Colorado in 2003 to aid Division biologists in
monitoring this species for evidence of CWD. Since 2002, 528 moose
have been tested, resulting in 3 positives to date.
CWD has been found in portions of northeastern Colorado and
southeastern Wyoming for more than 2 decades. State and federal
health officials have found no connection between CWD and any human
illness. As a precaution, however, hunters are advised not to eat
meat from diseased animals.
Hunters who submit infected animals for testing are contacted and
given the choice of having their license fee refunded or receiving a
replacement license for the same game management unit. They also
receive a refund for the cost of reasonable processing.
Hunters may submit animals for testing at DOW offices around the
state and at the offices of some veterinarians. For a complete list
of submission sites and for more information about testing and
chronic wasting disease, visit the DOW Web site at

The Colorado Division of Wildlife is the state agency responsible for
managing wildlife and its habitat, as well as providing wildlife
related recreation. The Division is funded through hunting and
fishing license fees, federal grants and Colorado Lottery proceeds
through Great Outdoors Colorado.

_Alces alces_, the moose, is the largest member of the Cervidae
family and is found in many regions of North America, Russia, and
Europe. In Europe they are sometimes referred to as elk. By nature,
they prefer cooler temperatures, having a difficult time when the
temperature reaches 80 F or 27 C. - Mod.TG]
