[The] source of _Listeria_ bacteria [has been] found. Smoked blade shoulder pork produced by a firm called "Ekstra Mein" in Kumanovo [Macedonia] is most probably the source of _Listeria_ bacteria in Macedonia, which infected 8 people, 4 of whom died, the Macedonian online news edition Utrinski Vesnik reported.

The contagious diseases commission with the ministry of health said the _Listeria_ found were of the same prototype the 8 people were infected with. Yesterday [6 Aug 2014] it was announced that a 5th person had died of listeriosis in Macedonia.

A sample of smoked pork neck slices, product of Kumanovo company 'Extra Mein', has tested positive for the presence of _Listeria_ bacteria, which is a 98 percent match with the bacteria genotype found in 8 patients in Macedonia, 4 of whom have died.

This is a serious direction for locating the source of the disease. Relevant institutions should now make epidemiological tests and take further measures for following the chain of the disease outbreak, Zvonko Milenkovic, chair of the Commission for Infectious Disease at the Ministry of Health, told reporters on Wednesday [6 Aug 2014].

Director of the Food and Veterinary Dejan Runtevski said all of the smoked pork neck slices products would be withdrawn from retail sale by the end of the day. An order has been also issued for putting the production on hold, which will enable testing of samples taken from the working places, machines, and anywhere that this bacterium may be present, Runtevski said. All products that are to be distributed to markets will be also tested, he added.

Potentially _Listeria_ contaminated products of 'Ekstra Mein' meat industry have been recalled Wednesday [6 Aug 2014], after Health Ministry and Food and Veterinary Agency detected _Listeria_ presence in smoked pork neck slices.

Meanwhile, Food and Veterinary Agency recommends for citizens to stop consuming Ekstra Mein's product 'smoked pork neck slices', lots 07632 and 07633, produced at 21.07.2014 and best before 04.09.2014.

The Food and Veterinary Agency is working toward detection of the _Listeria_ source, conducting further tests and analyses.

As of 30 Jul 2014, the Agency implements extremely strict control of all lots of animal source food to prevent, decrease, and eliminate the risk of _Listeria_ [contamination].

[Telegraf.mk reports that in response to findings that their product vacuum pork neck, is the cause of the listeriosis that infected 9 people and killed 4 of them, the company "Ekstra Mein" from Kumanovo, said all their products, including the sliced pork neck, are thermally treated at a temperature of 73-79 deg C [163.4-174.2 deg F], which guarantees destruction of the bacteria _Listeria_.]

The company claims that since the beginning of the year [2014], according to a regular plan for sampling, 158 samples were taken from 112 products and swabs (69 of desktops and machines and 43 of workers). All obtained results were negative to the presence of any bacteria.

"It is impossible for thermally unprocessed product to exit our company. All products, including the sliced pork neck are thermally treated at a temperature of 73-79 deg C [163.4-174.2 deg F], which guarantees destruction of the bacteria _Listeria_. Additionally, the company is subject to constant quality controls of the products. We have a regular plan of test sampling of the finished product in accordance with legal regulations, a regular plan for taking swabs, as well as our own control system using a device that detects the presence of organic matter. The 3 extraordinary controls in our factory in the past 10 days by the Food and Veterinary Agency and the Ministry of Health of the overall HACCP [Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points]-documentation and hygiene-technical norms at the facility showed no irregularities. All samples and swabs taken from "Ekstra Mein" were negative," the statement said.

The company will require superanalysis of this product (for the isolate as well as the typization) from the Food and Veterinary Agency, which should be made in world-renowned institution.

"Ekstra Mein" management also [points out] the fact that the sample with bacteria was found in products in retail shops, so the company cannot guarantee how the products were kept, if loss of vacuum was possible and, if that was the case, whether they came in contact with other products that contain bacteria.

[A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail archive no 20071230.4186.

In the US, _Listeria monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).

Presumably, what the 1st news report refers to as the "prototype" may be the molecular pattern found on PFGE of _L. monocytogenes_ strains. If so, the news report is saying that all 8 patients had the same "prototype" (that is, PFGE subtype), suggesting a common source, and the "prototype" of the strains isolated from the 8 patients is the same as the "prototype" of the strain isolated from the suspected food source (smoked pork). However, the manufacturer of the pork meat product contends that contamination with _L. monocytogenes_ occurred after the product left their facility.
