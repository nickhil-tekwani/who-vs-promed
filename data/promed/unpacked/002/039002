Morobe people dying of mysterious disease
-----------------------------------------
Authorities in Papua New Guinea [PNG] are investigating a mysterious
disease that reportedly claimed the lives of more than 40 people in a
remote District of Morobe province last week. A total of 10 villages with
no health facilities and poor road and communication links are reported to
have been affected by the disease.

While local media reports say 70 people have died from the mysterious
disease, the Morobe Provincial Health Office has denied that. The health
advisor Dr Theo Likei says that 20 people died of dysentery in the remote
Menyamya District last week, and 21 died of a mysterious influenza-like
disease. He says more than 800 people have been affected from nearly 10
villages. He says the worst affected are children and pregnant women.

The Morobe Provincial Health authorities say they have responded as soon as
the reports of the deaths reached them. But Dr Theo Likei says medicines
could not be delivered on time as the area is so remote and there are no
road links.

Officials from both WHO and PNG's Health Department have visited the
affected villages and will test samples collected, to determine the cause
of the deaths.

41 dead, hundreds affected by mystery illness in Papua New Guinea's Morobe
Province
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Outbreaks of dysentry and influenza in the Menyamya district of Papua New
Guinea's Morobe Province have claimed the lives of 41 people in the past 3
weeks. The provincial health advisor for Morobe, Dr Theo Likei, confirmed
more than 800 people have become unwell and 21 have died from influenza and
a further 20 are dead due to dysentry. He says the cause is not yet known
and more villagers may die.

"The centre of the outbreak is in one village in Menyamya district but
people in 9 other villages have also become unwell. The location of the
problem seems to be centred around one particular village, that's Akwanda
village. There are 9 other villages being involved, but with fewer numbers
than Akwanda. Akwanda definitely had about 99 per cent of the total. Out of
830 700 plus are from Akwanda. Out of 41 deaths, 40 deaths are from Akwanda
alone."

A total of 27 people have been transported out of Akwanda village for
further treatment. A medical team from Port Moresby, including staff from
WHO, and supplies have been dispatched. The situation is being continuously
monitored but communication with the villages is difficult due to their
remote locations.

Dr Likei says medical staff are working around the clock to contain the
illness outbreak and, if there is any further spread, more help from
outside the district will be needed.

[These 2 reports are conflicting. The 1st suggests a specific outbreak of
influenza-like illness (possibly influenza pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza
virus) on account of the vulnerability of children and pregnant women. The
2nd suggests a more extensive multifaceted outbreak. Further information is
awaited.
