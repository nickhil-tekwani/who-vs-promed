Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation confirmed on Monday [16 Jun 2014] that it had so far recorded 19 deaths and 53 ebolavirus infections. According to a press statement, 138 cases of the Ebola disease have so far been tested.

Community sensitisation in the Kailahun district in the east and its environs including other areas in the West African state has been intensified.

The release made it clear that rumours about a confirmed case of an Ebola patient at the main referral hospital in the capital Freetown, the Connaught Hospital, were not true [see comment below].

The release states: "The Ministry of Health is not restricting the movement of people, but the purpose of the screenings at checkpoints or border crossing areas are to avert the risk of contracting the disease." The statement also mentioned the strengthening of surveillance at checkpoints within Kailahun where the disease 1st manifested itself.

Meanwhile, the ministry said it was happy to disclose that 4 people, who earlier tested positive, had proved to [have converted to] negative and had been discharged.

[Below is the latest revision of EVD numbers from Sierra Leone. When a patient who initially tested PCR positive for a virus has a negative PCR test result after treatment, it means that person has cleared the virus from the bloodstream and may be considered cured. News of cured EVD patients in Sierra Leone is very welcome:

WHO reported in its update of 10 Jun 2104 http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_06_10_ebola/en regarding Sierra Leone:

"As of 18:00 on 6 Jun 2014, 8 new cases (2 confirmed and 6 suspected) and one new death were reported from Kailahun (3 cases and 1 death), Kenema (1 case and 0 deaths), Bo (1 case and 0 deaths), Port Loko (1 case and 0 deaths), and *Freetown* (2 cases and 0 deaths)." But WHO also stated in the same update that: "Overall, the total number of cases is subject to change due to reclassification, retrospective investigation, consolidation of cases and laboratory data, and enhanced surveillance," (asterisks added). - Mod.JW
