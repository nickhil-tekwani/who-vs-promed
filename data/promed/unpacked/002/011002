[1] WHO update
Date: 3 Aug 2014

http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news/4238-ebola-virus-disease-west-africa-31-july-2014.html


As of 30 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 4 countries stands at 1440 including 826 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:

- Guinea, 472 cases (337 confirmed, 122 probable, and 12 suspected) including 346 deaths;
- Liberia, 391 cases (109 confirmed, 181 probable, and 101 suspected) including 227 deaths;
- Sierra Leone, 574 cases (507 confirmed, 41 probable, and 26 suspected) including 252 deaths;
- Nigeria, 3 cases (1 probable and 2 suspected) and 1 death.

[See [4] below for WHO definitions of confirmed, probable & suspected for EVD. - Mod.JW]

Between 28-30 Jul 2014, 55 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD, and 58 deaths, were reported from the 4 countries as follows:

- Guinea, 5 new cases [including] 3 deaths;
- Liberia, 31 new cases [including] 46 deaths;
- Sierra Leone, 17 new cases [including] 9 deaths;
- Nigeria, 2 new suspected cases which on 1st test were negative.

The surge in the number of new EVD cases, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, calls for concentrated efforts by all to address the identified problems such as health facility transmission and effective contact tracing. More human resources experts are requested in these 2 countries to really tackle the progress of this outbreak. The situation in Guinea seems to be stable these 2 last days.

In Nigeria, 2 suspected cases among the contacts followed up at the airport were tested negative in the 1st PCR test. Another test will be done 48 hours later to confirm the status. The contact tracing is continuing as well as communication activities.

In Togo, some passengers from the flight to Lagos disembarked in Lome, and our epidemiologists in the field are working with the services at the airport to find out their addresses for contact tracing. The Togo and Nigeria EVD operational plans have been finalized and sent. The national authorities in Nigeria, Togo and Ghana continue to work closely with WHO and partners in identification of contacts and contact tracing as well as in preparing response plans [This suggests that, as he had no symptoms on embarkation in Sierra Leone, he developed them some time between Accra, Ghana & Lome, Togo. There is a table of confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Nigeria as of 30 Jul 2014 in the source. - Mod.JW].

The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone or Nigeria based on the current information available for this event [Nevertheless, the 3 originally infected countries have agreed to establish a militarized quarantine zone along their common borders; see ProMED archive 20140801.2652930. - Mod.JW].

[2] USA: no need to panic
Date: 2 Aug 2014

The State Department has brought one of 2 US citizens infected with EVD in West Africa back for treatment. The patient is now being treated in a special isolation unit at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, according to Reuters. Emory University confirmed that they're treating the patient:

"This special isolation unit was previously developed to treat patients who are exposed to certain serious infectious diseases. It is physically separate from other patient areas and has unique equipment and infrastructure that provide an extraordinarily high level of clinical isolation. Emory University Hospital physicians, nurses and staff are highly trained in the specific and unique protocols and procedures necessary to treat and care for this type of patient. The standard, rigorous infection control procedures used at Emory protect the patient, Emory health care workers, and the general public. As the CDC says, EVD does not pose a significant risk to the U.S. public."

The statement also said that a 2nd patient should arrive sometime during the week of 3 Aug 2014. It's most likely that this patient is a female missionary, the other infected American. Transmission of EVD will be prevented using standard protocols, and health officials say that the 2 pose very little risk to the general public.

Even if there were some terrible, unforeseen accident with one of these patients, EVD wouldn't be likely to spread very far. Firstly, EVD doesn't jump from person to person through the air, but through close contact by touching bodily fluids such as sweat, vomit, or blood. The outbreak in West Africa is so severe for a number of key reasons, including a lack of resources, inadequate infection-control measures, and mistrust of health workers [and government]. The USA, by contrast, has far better public-health infrastructure, and that makes all the difference.

[3] Other news

Militarized borders
------------
1 Aug 2014: A taxi driver in the frontier town of Nzerekore [Guinea], said he had to continue plying his trade across the border to earn an income. "The way I see it, either I die of starvation, or I die of Ebola. I won't take any passengers that have the symptoms, but in most cases it's malaria," whose early symptoms mimic those of EVD and kills thousands each year.

Repercussions elsewhere
-----------------------
1 Aug 2014: Four women have been arrested for illegally selling bush meat in Yamoussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire's capital. The outbreak has had unexpected effects beyond its borders. A military spokesperson for the African Union said it had cancelled a Sierra Leonean battalion rotation to Somalia, where the organisation is battling Al-Shabab Islamists.
http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/aug/01/ebola-outbreak-world-health-organisation-chief.

Sierra Leone athletes in UK for Games
-----------------------
1 Aug 2014: On Friday [1 Aug 2014] it emerged that athletes from the country were considering extending their stay amid fears over the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in West Africa; 2 Sierra Leone athletes at the Games have been tested and cleared for EVD. On the issue of the team returning to Sierra Leone, Unisa Deen Kargbo said: "Athletes have come to me and said they don't want to return because of the EVD situation. There have been discussions back home to see what the final decision will be on that. I have a mandate to return the athletes on 5 Aug [2014], and that's what I'm working towards now" http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-28621318.

[There is an obvious need for education about avoiding EVD infection for Sierra Leoneans, even for those outside their country. - Mod.JW]

India: airport screening
--------------------
1 Aug 2014: Indian troops deployed in the UN peacekeeping operations in west and central Africa have been put on high alert against the Ebola virus disease [EVD] following the deadliest outbreak of the disease in the region, the Union health ministry said on Friday [1 Aug 2014]. All airports have also been put on alert. Doctors attached to the Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata [Calcutta] told HT that they would start screening all passengers for EVD from the coming week. As of now, passengers are being tested for Japanese encephalitis and dengue http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ebola-virus-scare-kolkata-airport-to-screen-passengers/article1-1247485.aspx.

Ethiopia, Kenya Boost Anti-Ebola Measures
------------------------------
3 Aug 2014: Kenya and Ethiopia, home to 2 of Africa's largest transport hubs, said Thursday [31 Jul 2014] they had boosted measures to combat possible Ebola virus disease cases arriving in their countries. Kenya's National Disaster Operation Centre said in a statement that "port health services are on standby, with enhanced screening at border points to prevent and contain any possible disease threat."

Meanwhile, Ethiopia Airlines said it was taking "extraordinary precautions in connection with the outbreak of the disease." Ethiopia's national carrier is a major airline connecting countries across Africa, as well as flying to the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. "Stringent and specific surveillance is being carried out regarding all flights from West Africa at Addis Ababa airport," the airline said in a statement http://www.tadias.com/08/03/2014/ethiopia-kenya-boosts-anti-ebola-measures.

[4] WHO Case definition recommendations for EVD
Date: 9 Apr 2014

http://who.int/csr/resources/publications/ebola/ebola-case-definition-contact-en.pdf


Case definition recommendations for Ebola or Marburg Virus Diseases
-------------------------------------------
Note: During an Ebola or Marburg outbreak, surveillance should use the case definitions described in section 2, 3 and 4.

2. Community-based surveillance: standard case definition
This definition of "alert cases" for Ebola or Marburg virus disease has been developed for use by the community or community-based volunteers. It may be used for community-based surveillance during the pre-epidemic phase and during the outbreak.

Alert case:
Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area,
OR at least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine
OR any sudden death
Instructions:
If an alert case (living or dead) is identified:
Report the case to a surveillance team or to the closest health centre.

3. During an Ebola or Marburg outbreak, case definitions used by the surveillance:
Important: during an outbreak, the case definitions are likely to be modified to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local event.

3a. Case definition to be used by mobile teams or health stations and health centres:
SUSPECTED CASE:
Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with:
- a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola or Marburg case;
- a dead or sick animal (for Ebola)
- a mine (for Marburg) [as for gold or diamonds]
OR: any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least 3 of the following symptoms:
- headaches
- vomiting
- anorexia/loss of appetite
- diarrhea
- lethargy
- stomach pain
- aching muscles or joints
- difficulty swallowing
- breathing difficulties
- hiccup
OR: any person with inexplicable bleeding
OR: any sudden, inexplicable death.
Instructions when a suspected case has been identified:
- Report the case to the surveillance team.
- After obtaining express consent, collect a sample.
- Fill in a case notification form.
- Draw up a list of contacts of the suspected case.
If the subject is alive, explain to the patient and his/her family the need to go to hospital to receive adequate medical care. After having obtained the consent of the patient or his/her family, arrange for transfer. If the subject has passed away, explain to the family the need for conducting a safe burial. After obtaining consent, coordinate funeral arrangements with the burial team.

3b. Case definition for exclusive use by hospitals and surveillance teams
PROBABLE CASE:
Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician
OR: Any deceased suspected case (where it has not been possible to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation) having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case
Note: if laboratory specimens are collected in due time during the illness, the preceding categories are reclassified as "laboratory confirmed" cases and "non-case."
LABORATORY CONFIRMED CASE: Any suspected or probable cases with a positive laboratory result. Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Marburg or Ebola.

NON-CASE: Any suspected or probable case with a negative laboratory result. "Non-case" showed no specific antibodies, RNA or specific detectable antigens.

[I do not expect soldiers to be happy about being posted into the hot zone at the border; expect some resistance or desertion.

There is, unfortunately, a lot of unreasonable fear in the USA about EVD in the wake of the repatriation of an American case. Apparently, Sierra Leoneans abroad are not the only ones that need educating about EVD transmission and prevention. - Mod.JW
