I am forwarding you a link with the official information published in the website of the veterinary services of Macedonia, regarding the undiagnosed death in small ruminants.

Briefly, it says that the cause of death is _Listeria_ and the animals were infected via contaminated feed.

Laboratory analysis of samples from the animals and feed in the sheep/goat farm in the village of [Sopot in Kumanovo district], where 175 animals died in December [2014], have confirmed listeriosis to be the cause of the reported mortality. The bacterium was detected in tissues of the dead animals and in feed samples. This confirms the initial suspicions by the competent veterinary association of Kumanovo and representatives from the Food and Veterinary Agency.

The infection was caused by contaminated silage, a common source of infection for such cases in winter and early spring. The incubation period for the disease is 2-3 weeks; unfortunately, the breeder, without being aware of the problem, continued to feed the animals with the contaminated silage up to the appearance of the clinical signs.

Representatives of the Food and Veterinary Agency visited the farm on 15 Jan 2015, and noted the disease subsiding and no new cases appearing. Restrictions on the movements of the animals and disinfection requirements have been imposed on the affected farm. Guidelines to protect humans from infection have been issued. The measures will remain in force until expiration of the incubation period of the disease following detection of the last case.

[A wide variety of animal species can be infected with _Listeria monocytogenes_, but clinical listeriosis is mainly a ruminant disease, with occasional sporadic cases in other species. Outbreaks in ruminants are most prevalent during spring and winter seasons. Soil contamination and ingestion of contaminated silage are the primary modes of transmission. Poor quality silage, a pH greater than 5.5 is commonly implicated, and accounts for listeriosis often being referred to as "silage disease". Both host management and the pathogen itself make different contributions to the occurrence of the disease.

The clinical manifestations of listeriosis in animals include rhombencephalitis (affecting the brainstem and cerebellum; or in some cases more disseminated encephalitic changes), septicaemia, and abortion, especially in sheep, goats, and cattle. During an outbreak within a flock or herd, usually only one clinical form of listeriosis is encountered. The rhombencephalitic form is referred to as "circling disease" because of a tendency of the animal to circle in one direction, and it is the most common manifestation of the disease in ruminants. Also, it is amongst the most common causes of neurological disease in ruminants. The clinical signs include depression, anorexia, head pressing or turning of the head to one side, and unilateral cranial nerve paralysis. The latter is due to involvement of cranial nerves and their nuclei within the brainstem. Abortion is usually late term (after 7 months in cattle and 12 weeks in sheep). The septicaemic form is relatively uncommon and generally, but not invariably, occurs in the neonate. It is marked by depression, inappetence, fever, and death. In sheep, endophthalmitis (inflammation of the ocular cavities and their adjacent structures) is a typical disease sign, and may be unilateral. Rarely, mastitis (inflammation of breast tissue) of ruminants has been associated with _L. monocytogenes_ infection. Gastrointestinal infections can occasionally occur in sheep.

The post-mortem findings and histopathology in animal listeriosis depend on the clinical presentation. In the encephalitic form, the cerebrospinal fluid may be cloudy and the meningeal vessels congested. Gross lesions are generally subtle and characterised by vascular congestion and mild tan discoloration of the brainstem. On occasion, the medulla shows areas of softening (malacia) and abscessation. Characteristic histopathological changes consist of foci of intraparenchymal neutrophils and macrophages (microabscesses) in the brainstem with adjacent perivascular mononuclear cuffing. The microabscesses often affect one side more severely. More extensive malacic pathology may occur. The medulla and pons are most severely involved. In the septicaemic form, multiple foci of necrosis in the liver and, less frequently the spleen, may be noted. Aborted fetuses of ruminants show very few gross lesions, but autolysis may be present if the fetus was retained before being expelled.

Those diseases affecting the nervous system such as rabies, gid (coenurosis or sturdy; invasion of the brain and spinal cord by the intermediate stage of _Taenia multiceps_), scrapie, pregnancy toxemia, and deficiency diseases in lambs such as enzootic ataxia (swayback) and polioencephalomalacia (PEM, or cerebrocortical necrosis, CCN) should be differentiated from listeriosis. Silage feeding should be discontinued if an outbreak of listeriosis is confirmed. In the case of abortion, isolation of aborting ewes and does from their offspring reduces further infection of the dam. The recommended drugs used for treatment of listeriosis include oxytetracycline, penicillin-G, and dexamethasone.

Listeriosis is zoonotic; affected animals may not be slaughtered for meat. They must be either treated immediately or euthanized.

The food industry and public health agencies play a pivotal role in the prevention of foodborne listeriosis by developing and implementing effective HACCP (hazard analysis and critical control points) programmes to reduce the presence of _L. monocytogenes_ at all critical points in the food production and distribution chain (from the farm to the market). Likewise, the lack of well designed and tested vaccines for animal use, means that control of listeriosis in animals is most feasible by preventing the environmental conditions that favour its presentation. There is a well established link between silage feeding and listeriosis and, as _L. monocytogenes_ is widely distributed in nature, with animals and birds acting as carriers, contamination of silage is not uncommon. Emphasis should therefore be placed on reducing the likelihood of the multiplication of the organism, which occurs more frequently at pH values greater than 5, particularly where ineffective fermentation has occurred and where there is concomitant growth of moulds. Every effort should be made to produce silage of good quality, with early cutting of grass, minimal contamination with soil or faeces, and ensuring optimal anaerobic fermentation, which will insure that the pH falls below 5.0; at that level, growth of _Listeria_ spp is inhibited. The best silage for feeding should be selected, especially in the case of sheep, discarding material that has obvious signs of contamination with mould. Material a few centimetres from the top, front and sides of an opened bale or bag, should also be discarded. Leftover silage should be removed.
