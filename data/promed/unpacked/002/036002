Meat in one of the markets in Pavlodar was contaminated with anthrax
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Meat which was illegally for sale in one of the markets in Pavlodar was
contaminated with anthrax organisms. "Laboratory tests have confirmed the
presence of _Bacillus anthracis_ in the meat," said the chief state
sanitary-veterinarian Rashid Nurbekov.

Investigations have identified the owner of the goods. Results of
laboratory tests will be given to prosecutors.

Readers will recall that on 24 Jun 2010 at one of the markets in Pavlodar
some 150 kg [330 pounds] of horse meat were seized. It had been imported
from the quarantine area closed because of the anthrax in Aksu region. It
was found that the undocumented meat in the market was rejected, but had
been bought for sale by one of the market dealers.
