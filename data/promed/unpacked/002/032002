According to the local Public Health Epidemiological Bulletin, 4 people were poisoned last week [week of 28 Sep 2015] in Huesca Province [Aragon], after eating wild mushrooms collected in the Broto area. This was a familial occurrence, and all persons affected received medical care after presenting with profuse sweating and diarrhea.

The mushrooms, which were collected in the morning in the Broto area and eaten at night, were from different species, and the affected persons picked them up believing they were edible.

This outbreak is the 1st occurrence reported from the Public Health service since the beginning of the mushroom season in Aragon. Each fall, the agency reports numerous cases of food poisoning and advises the public to only collect mushrooms they know well and know they are fit for consumption.

In the highland Pyrenees the season started in mid-September [2015], while in the rest of the community it has been in the last 2 weeks. The spring drought and the July heat did foresee a rough start, but the August and September rainfalls helped in the recovery of forests and the forecast for mushroom picking is good for this early fall.

[It can be difficult to distinguish between mushrooms that are toxic and those that are not toxic. Many stories and articles are written about successful mushroom hunters and these stories take on some romanticized ideal in the minds of many; after all, how hard can it be find the right mushroom? It can be very difficult. Deadly difficult. And do not feed those mushrooms to your pets. Dogs and cats die every year because of toxic mushrooms. Play it safe, pay the price, and purchase from a reputable market. - Mod.TG
