Abstract:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease, has moved rapidly around the globe, infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used, appropriately and less appropriately, to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, often dominated by a small number of individuals, and heavily influenced by superspreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features of SARS-CoV-2, e.g., high stochasticity under low prevalence (as compared to other pathogens, such as influenza), and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics cannot be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings, stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, produce processing facilities, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties, and nightclubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity to effectively contain outbreaks with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the different types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, empirical evidence for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.

In this paper, the authors have highlighted the various congregational/gathering events and accounts from super spreading events in long-term care facilities, prisons, meat and fish processing facilities on the transmission dynamics and subsequent epidemiological control of SARS-CoV-2. The paper describes the potential types of SSEs, their impact on transmission, and gives recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.

The paper describes at least 4 types of SSEs, including;
1. Biological. Individuals with a higher probability of transmitting per contact. These may be hard to identify prior to the event based on a number of factors;
2. Behavioral/social;
3. High-risk facilities and places such as meat-packing plants, workers' dormitories, prisons, long-term care facilities, or healthcare settings. The nature of interactions in these places can potentially repeatedly place individuals at higher risk of acquiring and transmitting infection. Importantly, this driver of SSEs can lead to spillover from these locations into the larger
community;
4. "Opportunistic" scenarios. The 1st scenario is when larger numbers of individuals temporarily cluster, and even with an average probability of transmission per contact, people are briefly far above their "average" number of susceptible contacts. The 2nd scenario is that the probability of transmission per contact is temporarily increased in an unusual way, such as singing or frequent loud speaking. These 2 opportunistic scenarios are more frequently seen in outbreaks at nightclubs, cruise ships, crowded public transportation, parties, choirs, or other mass gathering events. The same individual placed in 2 different situations can or cannot initiate an SSE based on the situation.

The authors conclude: "Many recent outbreaks such as in Florida, Texas, California, the Montreal metropolitan area, and in Spain (Catalunya and Aragon) were either linked to the reopening of indoor dining, bars, nightclubs, or private social gatherings where physical distancing wasn't respected, or linked to workers living in close quarters. Therefore, even though some governments took drastic measures to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the loosening of these measures has blind spots, which may not be very large, but are large enough for SSEs to occur.

Novel methods are needed to quickly predict, identify, or isolate individuals/hotspots with the potential for causing SSEs. It may prove difficult to identify and isolate individuals with the potential for causing SSEs and infectious individuals that still transmit. This is compounded with the sizeable proportion of pre-symptomatic as well as asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals who can actively transmit.

If SSE predictors cannot be identified, then every infectious individual has the opportunity to cause an SSE if exposed to sizable susceptible populations. Therefore, it is crucial to understand types of hotspots and patterns of transmission for each type, as interventions might have to focus on all hotspots at high risk for SSEs and limit gatherings at these places and/or through rapid and extensive testing and contact tracing (both traditional and digital) identify pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people."

So, the protocol remains: Social distancing, promoting universal masking behaviors in all public locations for the unforeseeable future, and, in case an event occurs, treat as a potential SSE with active case finding and contact tracing to contain transmission. - Mod.UBA]

[2] COVID-19 disruption of immunization campaigns
Date: 11 Nov 2020

https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-11-millions-coronavirus-disrupts-immunisation-campaigns.html


Millions of people, including in Africa's most populous country, Nigeria, risk contracting diseases such as polio and measles as the coronavirus pandemic has halted vaccination campaigns, the UN said on Wed 11 Nov 2020.

Additional financial resources are needed to safely resume vaccinations, the UN childrens' agency UNICEF and the World Health Organization said in a joint statement.

"We cannot allow the fight against one deadly disease to cause us to lose ground in the fight against other diseases," said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore. Addressing the global COVID-19 pandemic is critical. However, other deadly diseases also threaten the lives of millions of children in some of the poorest areas of the world," she added in a joint statement with WHO.

While Nigeria, home to 200 million people, eradicated wild polio in August 2020, it remains at risk of vaccine-derived polio.

Measles is among the leading cause of death and disability in children in the country, where 54 percent have only received one vaccine dose, according to the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey.

On Mon 9 Nov 2020, authorities said they were battling a suspected outbreak of yellow fever in 2 southern states, Delta and Enugu, that left more than 70 dead according to local media.

In neighbouring Benue state, more than a dozen unexplained deaths have been reported in recent days.

The percentage of people immunised against yellow fever remains low in many parts of Africa, even though the vaccine is nearly 100 percent effective.

Coronavirus has claimed 1160 lives and infected 64 336 in Nigeria, but these numbers are thought to be conservative due to a lack of testing.

International health bodies are now calling for immunisations to fully resume worldwide in order to protect lives.

"Unlike with COVID, we have the tools and knowledge to stop diseases such as polio and measles," said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "What we need are the resources and commitments to put these tools and knowledge into action. If we do that, children's lives will be saved," he said.

In Nigeria, immunisations for measles and polio are available at all government health centres, according to Peter Hawkins, UNICEF Nigeria Country Representative.

"All caregivers and parents need to ensure that their children are fully vaccinated and protected from childhood killer diseases," he said, "including ensuring that all doses are taken, so that the vaccine can be effective."

[3a] Dominant Mutations in circulating COVID-19 strains

Abstract
The spike D614G substitution is prevalent in global SARS-CoV-2 strains, but its effects on viral pathogenesis and transmissibility remain unclear. We engineered a SARS-CoV-2 variant containing this substitution. The variant exhibits more efficient infection, replication, and competitive fitness in primary human airway epithelial cells, but maintains similar morphology and in vitro neutralization properties, compared with the ancestral wild-type virus. Infection of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transgenic mice and Syrian hamsters with both viruses resulted in similar viral titers in respiratory tissues and pulmonary disease. However, the D614G variant transmits significantly faster and displayed increased competitive fitness than the wild-type virus in hamsters. These data show that the D614G substitution enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, competitive fitness, and transmission in primary human cells and animal models.

[This study offers a compelling argument for why D614G has become the dominant strain worldwide. The authors have demonstrated through animal studies the efficient transmission dynamics of the virus strains carrying the specific Aspartate(D) amino acid to Glycine(G) mutation in mammalian hosts. Other studies have reported that this particular strain now dominates globally and is associated with high transmission capacity. Almost all strains with D614G mutation also have a mutation in the other proteins responsible for replication (ORF1ab P4715L; RdRp P323L), which might affect replication speed of the virus. This protein is the target of the anti-viral drugs, remdesivir and favipiravir, and the susceptibility for mutations suggests that treatment-resistive strains may emerge quickly (https://www. who.int/bulletin/volumes/98/7/20-253591/en/).

The study concludes appropriately that "The effect of the D614G variant on vaccine efficacy has been of major concern. Consistent with previous studies, we showed overall equivalent sensitivity of the both luciferase reporter viruses to the 25 convalescent human sera and 6 RBD [Receptor binding Domain]-binding mAbs, suggesting the D614G substitution does not significantly shift SARS-CoV-2 neutralization properties.

These data also suggest that the current vaccine approaches directed against WT spike should be effective against the D614G strains. The relationship between increased transmission and virulence remains complex and could be impacted by age, sex, and other comorbidities, and it is unclear whether the minimum infectious dose may be lower for D614G in humans. It is clearly important to monitor and identify the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission and pathogenesis and/or altered antigenicity, especially as levels of human herd immunity and active interventions alter the selective forces that operate on the genome. - Mod.UBA]

[3b] Dominant Mutations in circulating COVID-19 strains
Date: 11 Nov 2020

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8945641/D614G-strain-coronavirus-better-infecting-human-cells-original-version.html


A mutated version of the coronavirus, dubbed D614G, is found in 85 per cent of global cases, and researchers believe this version is so common because its genetic modification makes it more infectious and better at spreading.

However, analysis from experts at the University of North Carolina found the change did not make it more deadly or likely to cause severe symptoms.

D614G is by far the most common strain of coronavirus affecting humans worldwide and 1st appeared in February 2020 in Europe. International travel allowed this variant to spread across the continent and into the Americas, Oceania, and Asia within weeks.

In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, the dominant guise of the virus was a variant now called the "D strain." However, the D614G mutation sprung up at one specific location, position 614, on the spike protein of the virus, in a European patient. This viral spike hijacks the human receptor ACE2, and this is how it infects human cells.

The location of the mutation sits at a critical juncture, which affects how the virus cleaves in half after infiltrating a cell. The mutation is very small and simple, one amino acid is changed from a D (aspartate) to a G (glycine), hence the moniker D614G.

As Italians, Britons, and others from coronavirus hotspots travelled to Asia, Australia and America, the D614G virus then took hold in these regions. Data from a study published last month [October 2020] show a spike of the G strain in Europe at the start of February 2020, followed by another resurgence of the G variant a fortnight later.

By the start of March 2020, cases of D614G were spotted around the world, and this specific mutation made up around a quarter of all cases. It continued to take over and constituted more than 70 per cent of all cases by May 2020, and the number is now thought to exceed 85 per cent.

Scientists have been trying to determine why the D614G strain emerged as the principal form of SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 14 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov14_1605436507.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 40.9% of daily case numbers and 34.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 22.7 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Other countries/territories reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica and Panama. And countries reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Paraguay.

- The European region reported 43.4% of daily case numbers and 48.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 14.7 million. Countries not reporting cases today (14 Nov 2020) include Israel, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, UK, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Spain, and Ukraine.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.3% of daily case numbers and 8.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.5 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, Tunisia, and UAE. Libya, Palestinian Authority, and Kuwait each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, Yemen and Somalia have not reported any cases in the last few days.

- The African region reported 1.03% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.39 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Ghana, Ethiopia, Uganda, Nigeria, Congo Republic (Brazzaville), Cabo Verde, Mayotte, Angola, and Mozambique. Countries not reporting any new cases include Ghana, Madagascar, Gabon, Mauritania, and Botswana, among others.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.82% of daily case numbers and 0.53% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.79 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by the Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, French Polynesia, Guam, China, and Mongolia.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.9 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: There is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region with combined reports from these 2 regions representing over 82% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (157 253), India (41 659), Italy (37 255), and France (32 095) have been dominant. A global total of 8897 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (13-14 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, India, Italy, France, Brazil (29 463), UK (26 860), Poland (25 571), Russia (22 702), Germany (16 077), Ukraine (12 524), and Iran (11 203). A total of 57 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 29 of the 57 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 4.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 15.8%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with the daily increase approaching 600 000 new cases in last 24 hours. This will change over the next few days as the weekend reporting artifacts set in with reduced or no reporting of cases in countries with known high levels of transmission [total number of reported cases has declined with many countries in Europe not reporting]. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The growth in the USA is exponential with almost 160 000 cases reported in the past 24 hours and the total number of reported deaths exceeding quarter of a million. - Mod.UBA]
