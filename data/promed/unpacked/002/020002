According to a report of the State Veterinary Inspectorate published on Mon 9 Aug 2021, 7 foci of bluetongue disease were discovered in cow herds in agricultural enterprises in Tissemsilt on Sun 8 Aug 2021. They included 10 cows kept on private agricultural enterprises located in the areas of Bani Mayda, Ain al-Enab, and Boumnouche in the municipality of Tissemsilt, and in the areas of Khanq al-Nahar, Mughila (Al-Ayoun), and Ain Tahtarit (Khemisti) in the city of Khemisti. The cattle were examined by veterinarians affiliated with the aforementioned inspectorate.

Based on the inspection report, preventive measures have been undertaken, including spraying the animals with insect repellents. This was accompanied by the launching of a wide awareness campaign at the level of agricultural enterprises, urging breeders to apply periodic disinfection and cleaning of stables, as well as spraying with insecticides. Public and private veterinarians have been alerted.

Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, primarily vectorborne viral disease that affects wild and domestic ruminants such as sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, deer, and most species of African antelope, and camelids as vertebrate hosts. The virus is primarily transmitted between susceptible vertebrate hosts by competent species of _Culicoides_ midges, and the global distribution of the disease is largely determined by the distribution of competent vectors. Infection with bluetongue virus (BTV) is inapparent in the vast majority of animals but can cause fatal disease in a proportion of infected sheep, deer, and wild ruminants.

There are 27 recognised BTV serotypes and several recently isolated but as yet unclassified unique 'atypical' strains.

BTV-4 is one of the oldest known serotypes, according to the Onderstepoort (South Africa) veterinary institute's data. In July 2020, BTV serotype 4 was reported by Algeria to the OIE as the cause of disease in sheep. BTV4 has recently been reported from Spain's Balearic islands, in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Information about the serotyping results of the BTV involved in the current event in Algeria, and about the clinical signs observed, is requested. BT infection of cattle is usually subclinical, with the exception of BTV-8 infection. Sheep are regarded significantly more susceptible, clinically, to BTV.
