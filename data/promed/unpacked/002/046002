Officials say Atlanta's largest hospital [Grady Memorial Hospital]
has confirmed finding _Legionella_ bacteria in patient rooms that
likely caused 4 cases of Legionnaire's disease in patients. [see
Archive 20090207.0555 - Mod.DK]

Grady Memorial Hospital officials said Thursday [12 Feb 2009] lab
tests showed _Legionella_ bacteria in water samples taken from
patient rooms on the 11th and 12th floors of a hospital tower. The
positive samples were taken from bathroom areas, not air vents. Four
of the patients who had stayed in rooms in that area have come down
with Legionnaire's disease since 1 Jan 2009.

No _Legionella_ were found in other parts of the hospital. The water
system is being flushed with hyperchlorinated water, but patients
still are not being allowed in the areas.

[The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in a prior
ProMED-mail post, Legionellosis, neonatal, nosocomial, fatal -
Cyprus: susp. 20090102.0011:

Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of disease caused
by _Legionella_ bacteria, usually _Legionella pneumophila_. About
80-90 percent of cases are caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1.
Legionnaires' disease is usually acquired by inhalation by a
susceptible person of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_.
Risk factors in adults include age over 50 years, cigarette smoking,
diabetes, chronic heart or lung disease, and immuno-suppression.

Usually, the water system in a hospital is incriminated as the
source. _Legionella_ are usually found primarily in the hot water
portion of plumbing systems and in cooling towers. Warm water
temperatures of 25-40 C (77-104 F) support the highest concentrations
of the organism in plumbing systems. In addition, _Legionella_ are
embedded in a biofilm that lines the inner walls of the plumbing
system's pipes and containers. Concentrations of the organism in the
water can be increased by any disruption of this biofilm. Infectious
aerosols can be generated by a building's faulty air conditioning
systems, shower heads, misters, and whirlpool spas.

Elimination or reduction of _Legionella_ colonization in a hot water
system is difficult. For a discussion, please see
<http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/html/legionella.htm>.

Genotyping patient and environmental isolates will help to confirm
the environmental source.
