Two new cases of measles detected in South Australia [ex Thailand and Bali, Indonesia]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A 45 year old man and a 21 year old woman have contracted measles during overseas trips to Thailand and Bali, in the latest spate of diagnoses in South Australia [SA]. Both are in a stable condition in hospital.

SA Health is warning South Australians to ensure they have measles vaccinations before going on holidays. "Measles is highly contagious among people who are not fully immunised, and is spread through coughing and sneezing," SA Health's chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said. "Measles is common in South East Asia so it is vital that people travelling to those regions check that they have had 2 doses of measles vaccine before leaving home."

The illness brings on symptoms such as fever, coughing, a runny nose and sore eyes, as well as a blotchy rash on the head and body. Professor Phillips warns people suffering similar symptoms should contact their GP prior to visiting to prevent the spread. "We are especially encouraging people to check their vaccination records and request the vaccine if there is no record of them receiving 2 doses," he said.

People born in Australia in mid-1960s to mid-1980s have commonly only had 1 vaccine. There have been 4 confirmed cases of measles this year [2016] in South Australia, compared to 4 in total for all of last year [2015].

[After 1 dose of measles vaccine, 85 per cent of children 9 months of age and 95 per cent over 12 months of age are immune. Nearly all of those who do not develop immunity after a single dose develop it after a 2nd dose.

Ottawa [Ontario] measles outbreak mitigated
-------------------------------------------
Ottawa Public Health [OPH], in collaboration with Leeds, Grenville, and Lanark Health Unit and Public Health Ontario, have determined, through further laboratory analysis, that 1 of 3 identified cases of measles is negative. This is welcome news in the evolving investigation of the measles outbreak, as it reduces the locations where measles exposure may have occurred.

OPH will continue to work closely with partners in protecting the community from further spread of this very contagious disease and will provide public updates as required.

OPH is also reporting that the following locations previously identified in the public service announcement, issued on 3 Sep [2016], are no longer considered sites where exposure to measles may have occurred. [See list of locations at source URL.]

The risk of contracting measles in Ottawa is low for those who have been vaccinated. However, given that measles is highly contagious, it is very important that you ensure you and your loved ones' measles immunizations are up to date.

[While 1 less case may seem insignificant, because of the infectiousness of measles and how easily it spreads, it is good news.
