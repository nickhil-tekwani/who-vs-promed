The list of symptoms of COVID-19 has grown longer and stranger throughout the pandemic. With so many people now vaccinated, the warning signs of an infection have grown more subtle and vague. That's becoming especially evident as the omicron variant gallops around the world, squeezing through the nooks and crannies in the wall of immunity that's been built over the past 2 years.

An international team of researchers has been tracking signs of infection throughout the pandemic with the COVID Symptom Study using a mobile app where users could self-report their symptoms. Data on the omicron variant are still preliminary, but a group of 171 app users in the United Kingdom, most of whom are vaccinated, recently reported that their top symptoms for omicron were a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and a sore throat. These were also the top symptoms for people infected with the delta variant.

That's a departure from "the classic 3" COVID-19 symptoms of fever, cough, and loss of sense of smell or taste associated with earlier variants, researchers say. "For most people, an omicron-positive case will feel much more like the common cold, starting with a sore throat, runny nose, and a headache," Tim Spector, a professor of epidemiology at King's College London and the lead scientist for the symptom study, told the BBC this week. "We need to change public messaging urgently to save lives" (https://www.bbc.com/news/health-59768366).

Among the 171 people in the recent symptom data analysis who were suspected or confirmed to be infected with omicron by Britain's National Health Service, the symptom study team found only half reported fever, cough, or a loss of taste or smell. Researchers in Norway recently reported similar findings from an omicron outbreak among fully vaccinated guests of a Christmas party. In 87 confirmed or probable cases, the most common symptoms were cough, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue, sore throat, and headache. Just over half reported a fever, while 23% experienced a loss of taste and 12 had a decline in smell (https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.50.2101147).

These cases are further evidence that the omicron variant is the most transmissible version of the virus so far, and it seems to be better able to evade prior immunity. Vaccines in the United States still offer strong protection against severe illness, however, especially with a booster shot.

"We know we will continue to hear more about people who get infected who are vaccinated," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House press conference this week. "These people may get mild or asymptomatic infections and could unknowingly spread those infections to others" (https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/12/22/press-briefing-by-white-house-covid-19-response-team-and-public-health-officials-75/).

In South Africa, one of the 1st places where the omicron variant was detected, widespread vaccinations against the disease combined with some immunity from prior infection may explain why omicron seems to present with milder symptoms. "We believe that it might not necessarily just be that omicron is less virulent, but we believe that this coverage of vaccination, also in addition to natural immunity of people who have already had contact with the virus, is also adding to the protection," South Africa's Health Minister Joe Phaahla told reporters last week. "That's why we are seeing mild illness."

In the United States, 73% of the population has had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and more than 50 million people have been infected previously, so a significant portion of the population has some degree of protection against the disease.

Even so, some people with omicron will fall severely ill. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 symptoms that demand emergency medical care include sudden confusion; inability to stay awake; persistent chest pain or pressure; trouble breathing; and lips, fingernail beds, and skin turning blue, pale, or gray.

While a smaller percentage of the infected get sick enough to go to the hospital, the overall increase in cases from omicron could result in enough illness to overwhelm the US healthcare system in the coming months. In addition, severe illnesses often start out with mild symptoms, and many COVID-19 treatments are most effective in the early stages of the disease. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently granted emergency authorization to the drug Paxlovid from Pfizer, the 1st oral antiviral to get a green light from the agency. It's recommended for "mild-to-moderate" COVID-19 cases in people with risk factors for severe disease.

The emergence of the cold-like symptoms with the omicron variant means that getting tested to confirm whether someone is infected with COVID-19 is more critical than ever to slow the spread of the virus. For people with preexisting health conditions, identifying infections early is key to deploying effective treatments in time.

Frequent rapid testing for COVID-19 can catch omicron cases, though they tend to have lower accuracy compared to more expensive and time-consuming PCR tests. Many local health departments are scaling up their public testing systems, and the FDA has increased the number of rapid rests authorized for use. But in some areas, rapid tests remain scarce and too costly to use regularly.

So it's crucial to take mild COVID-19 symptoms seriously and just as important to prevent infections in the first place. That requires getting vaccinated against COVID-19, getting a booster dose if eligible, wearing an effective face mask in public settings, and social distancing. Despite the latest twists in the pandemic, these measures remain the best bets for keeping the virus in check.

[Because of the similar early symptoms of COVID, the flu, colds, and allergies, it is difficult to distinguish which you have. With any question it might be COVID, a rapid test and isolation from others would be a good approach. Vaccination against flu and COVID should help prevent serious disease if exposure to either virus occurs. - Mod.LK]

[2] Pandemic mistakes
Date: Thu 23 Dec 2021

With omicron, everything is sped up. The new variant is spreading fast and far. At a time when delta was already sprinting around the country, omicron not only caught up but overtook it, jumping from an estimated 13% to 73% of US cases in a single week. We have less time to make decisions and less room to course-correct when they are wrong. Whereas we had months to prepare for delta in the United States, we've had only weeks for omicron. Every mistake gets amplified; every consequence hits us sooner. We should have learned after living through multiple waves and multiple variants of COVID, but we haven't, at least not enough. We keep making the same pandemic mistakes over and over again.

This is not March 2020. We have masks. We have better treatments. Our immune systems are much more prepared to fight off the virus, thanks to vaccines. But as a society, we are still not prepared. Here are the 6 traps that we keep falling into, each consequence made all the more acute because of omicron's speed.

We rush to dismiss it as "mild."
--------------------------------
In February 2020, when the then-novel coronavirus still seemed far away, a reassuring statistic emerged: 82% of cases were mild -- milder than SARS, certainly milder than Ebola. This notion would haunt our response: What's the big deal? Worry about the flu! Since then, we've learned what mild in "most" people can mean when the virus spreads to infect hundreds of millions: 5.4 million dead around the world, with 800 000 in just the United States.

This coronavirus has caused far more damage than viruses that are deadlier to individuals because it's more transmissible. A milder but more transmissible virus can spread so aggressively that it ultimately causes more hospitalizations and deaths. Mild initial infections can also lead to persistent, debilitating symptoms, as people with long COVID have learned. The notion of a mostly mild disease became entrenched so rapidly that the experience of many long-haulers was dismissed. We've seen how such early concepts can lead us astray, and still the idea of omicron as an intrinsically mild variant has already taken hold.

We don't know yet if omicron is less virulent than delta. We do know it's far more transmissible in highly immune places. That's enough for worry. We can expect omicron cases to be milder in vaccinated people than unvaccinated. And because the variant is able to infect many vaccinated people that delta cannot, the proportion of infected people who need to be hospitalized will look lower than delta's. What's less clear is if omicron is intrinsically any less virulent in unvaccinated people. Some early data from South Africa and the UK suggest that it might be, but confounding factors like previous immunity are hard to disentangle. In any case, omicron does not appear so mild that we can dismiss the hospitalization burden of a huge wave.

That burden will depend largely on how many unvaccinated and undervaccinated people omicron reaches. The United States simply has too many people who are entirely unvaccinated (27%) and people over 65 -- the age-group most vulnerable to COVID -- who are unboosted (44%). In a country of 330 million, that's tens of millions of people. Omicron will find them. Because this variant is so fast, the window for vaccinating or boosting people in time is smaller. And although vaccines remain very good at protecting against hospitalization, we make a mistake when...

We treat vaccines as all-or-nothing shields against infection.
--------------------------------------------------------------
When the COVID-19 vaccines first started rolling out this time last year [2020], they were billed as near-perfect shots that could block not only severe disease but almost all infections -- absolute wonders that would bring the pandemic to a screeching halt. The stakes some prominent experts laid out seemed to be: Get vaccinated, or get infected.

The summer of delta made it clear that the options were not binary. Vaccinated people were getting infected. Their antibody levels were dropping (as they always do after vaccination), and the new variant was super transmissible and slightly immune-dodging. Infections among the vaccinated very, very rarely turned severe, and the vaccines had never been designed to stave off all infections. But every positive test among the immunized was still labeled a breakthrough and carried a whiff of failure.

Our COVID shots were never going to stop infections forever -- that's not really what any vaccines do, especially when they're fighting swiftly shape-shifting respiratory viruses. Think of disease as a tug-of-war on a field with death and asymptomatic infection at opposite ends, and symptomatic disease and transmission in between. The vaccines are pulling in one direction, the virus in the other. A jacked vaccine can force the virus to yield ground: People who would have been seriously ill might get only an irksome cold; people who would have been laid up for a week might now feel nothing at all. When the virus shifts and gains strength, it will first make gains in the zone of infection. But it would have to pull really hard to completely usurp the stretch of field that denotes severe sickness, the vaccines' most durable stronghold.

With the highly mutated omicron, the coronavirus has once again yanked on the line. This should prompt a heave from us in response: an additional dose of vaccine. But no number of boosts can be expected to make bodies totally impermeable to infection. That means the vaccinated, who can still carry and pass on the virus, cannot exempt themselves from the pandemic, despite what the White House has implied. None of our tools, in fact, is sufficient on its own for this situation, which makes it extra dicey when...

We still try to use testing as a one-stop solution.
---------------------------------------------------
For tests to fulfill their very essential role in the pandemic toolkit, they need to be accessible, reliable, and fast. Nearly 2 years into the pandemic, that's still not an option for most people in the United States.

PCR-based tests, while great at detecting the virus early on in infection, take a long time to run and deliver results. Laboratory personnel remain overstretched and underfunded, and the supply shortages they battled early on never truly disappeared. Rapid at-home tests, although more abundant now, still frequently go out of stock; when people can find them, they're still paying exorbitant prices. The Biden administration has pledged to make more free tests available and reimburse some of the ones people nab off shelves. But those benefits won't kick in until after the new year, leapfrogging the holidays. And only people with private insurance will qualify for reimbursements, which are not always easy to finagle. If anything, the gross inequities in American testing are only poised to grow.

Even at their best, test results offer only a snapshot in time -- they just tell you if they detected the virus at the moment you swabbed your nose. And yet, days-old negatives are still being used as passports to travel and party. That left plenty of time for delta to sneak through; with the speedy, antibody-dodging omicron, the gaps feel even wider. It's a particular worry now because omicron seems to rocket up to transmissible levels on a faster timeline than its predecessors -- possibly within the 1st couple of days after people are infected. That leaves a dangerously tight window in which to detect the virus before it has a chance to spread. Test results were never a great proxy for infectiousness; now people will need to be even more careful when acting on results. Already there have been reports of people spreading omicron at parties, despite receiving negative test results shortly before the events.

Omicron cases are growing so quickly that they're already stressing the United States' frayed testing infrastructure. In many parts of the country, PCR testing sites are choked with hours-long lines and won't deliver answers in time for holiday gatherings; a negative result from a rapid antigen test, although speedier, might not hold from morning to afternoon. (Some experts are also starting to worry that certain rapid tests might not detect omicron as well as they did its predecessors, though some others, like the very-popular BinaxNOW, will probably be just fine; the FDA, which has already identified some PCR tests that are flummoxed by the variant, is investigating.) Our testing problem is only going to get worse, even as...

We pretend the virus won't be everywhere soon.
----------------------------------------------

We fail to prioritize the most vulnerable groups.
-------------------------------------------------
As omicron tears through the Unites States, it will likely repeat the inequities of the past 2 years. Elderly people, whose immune systems are naturally weaker, are especially reliant on the extra protection of a booster. But on top of the 44% who haven't had their boosters yet, 12% of Americans 65 and over aren't even "fully vaccinated" under the soon-to-be-updated definition. Boosters might not even be enough, which is why the most vulnerable elderly people -- those packed into nursing homes -- must be surrounded by a shield of immunity. But Joe Biden's vaccine mandate for nursing-home staff has faced legal opposition, and almost a quarter of such workers still aren't vaccinated, let alone boosted. Even if they all got their 1st shots today [23 Dec 2021], omicron is spreading faster than their immune defenses could conceivably accrue. Without other defenses, including better ventilation, masking for both staff and visitors, and rapid testing (but ... see above), nursing homes will become grim hot spots, as they were in the early pandemic and the 1st delta surge.

Working-class Americans are vulnerable too. In the pandemic's 1st year [2020], they were 5 times as likely to die of COVID-19 as college-educated people. Working-age people of color were hit even harder: 89% fewer would have lost their lives if they'd had the same COVID death rates as white college graduates. These galling disparities will likely recur, because the United States has done little to address their root causes.

The White House has stressed that "we know how to protect people and we have the tools to do it," but although America might have said tools, many Americans do not. Airborne viruses are simply more likely to infect people who live in crowded homes, or have jobs that don't allow them to work remotely. Making vaccines "available at convenient locations and for no cost," as the White House said it has done, doesn't account for the time it takes to book and attend an appointment or recover from side effects, and the 53 million Americans -- 44% of the workforce -- who are paid low wages, at an hourly median of USD 10, can ill-afford to take that time off. Nor can they afford to wait in long testing lines or to blow through rapid tests at USD 25 a pair. Making said tests reimbursable is little help to those who can't pay out of pocket, or to the millions who lack health insurance altogether.

Once infected, low-income people are also less likely to have places in which to isolate, or paid sick leave that would let them miss work. To make it feasible for vulnerable people to protect those around them, New York City is providing several free services for people with COVID, including hotel rooms, meal deliveries, and medical check-ins. But neither the Trump nor Biden administration pushed such social solutions, focusing instead on biomedical countermeasures such as therapeutics and vaccines that, to reiterate, cannot exempt people from the pandemic's collective problem.

Unsurprisingly, people with low incomes, food insecurity, eviction risk, and jobs in grocery stores and agricultural settings are overrepresented among the unvaccinated. The vaccine inequities of the summer will become the booster inequities of the winter, as the most privileged Americans once again have the easiest access to life-saving shots, while the more vulnerable ones are left to keep the economy running. Ultimately, the weight of all these failures will come to rest on the hospital system and the people who work in it.

We let healthcare workers bear the pandemic's brunt.

[3] Research: genetic selection for new variants

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic becomes increasingly challenging as the virus adapts to human hosts through the continual emergence of more transmissible variants. Simply observing that a variant is increasing in frequency is relatively straightforward, but more sophisticated methodology is needed to determine whether a new variant is a global threat and the magnitude of its selective advantage. We present 2 models for quantifying the strength of selection for new and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 relative to the background of contemporaneous variants. These methods range from a detailed model of dynamics within one country to a broad analysis across all countries, and they include alternative explanations such as migration and drift. We find evidence for strong selection favoring the D614G spike mutation and B.1.1.7 (alpha), weaker selection favoring B.1.351 (beta), and no advantage of R.1 after it spreads beyond Japan. Cutting back data to earlier time horizons reveals that uncertainty is large very soon after emergence, but that estimates of selection stabilize after several weeks. Our results also show substantial heterogeneity among countries, demonstrating the need for a truly global perspective on the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

The emergence of new variants with increased contagiousness or resistance mutations has significant implications for control of COVID-19, especially given that very few countries have been able to use NPI [nonpharmaceutical intervention] alone to bring the viral growth rate subcritical for extended periods of time. This situation is challenging as elevated contagiousness narrows the range under which vaccination programs can eliminate the virus, and it also opens up the possibility of escape mutations allowing infection among vaccinated persons. Integrating modeling into surveillance systems will help facilitate early-warning systems and improve our ability to design both pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions that can stop the spread of COVID-19.
