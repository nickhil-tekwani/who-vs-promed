Study shows hidden bird flu cases in Cambodia
---------------------------------------------
The H5N1 bird flu virus can infect people without causing noticeable
symptoms, but only rarely, according to a report published on
Thursday [21 May 2009].

A survey of more than 600 people in Cambodian villages where 2
children died from the virus shows 7 more were apparently infected,
but without having known about it. The study, published in the
Journal of Infectious Diseases [see comment below], also suggests
that people may become infected by swimming in ponds where infected
birds have dabbled. "Although these results cannot be considered to
be representative without broader confirmation, they show that, in
some settings, surveillance may substantially miss H5N1 virus
infections," Dr Sylvie Briand and Dr Keiji Fukuda of the World Health
Organization (WHO) wrote in a commentary.

The H5N1 avian influenza virus has been regularly causing outbreaks
of disease in birds -- 250 outbreaks in February [2009] alone in
Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, and Viet
Nam, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It
only rarely infects people but is often deadly when it does. WHO says
it has killed 261 people out of 424 infected since 2003. The big fear
is that is could change into a form that people can pass easily to
one another, sparking a pandemic. These fears have been overshadowed
at least a little by the near pandemic of much milder H1N1 swine flu
that started in March [2009].

One big question has been whether some people have been infected
without knowing it. If this is the case, the fatality rate would go
down. With current numbers, the fatality rate appears to be around 60
percent but if there are more than 424 infections it would make for a
lower rate.

Sirenda Vong of the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia and colleagues
followed up on 2 deaths of children from H5N1 in 2006. They
interviewed villagers and took blood samples. "7 (1 percent) of 674
villagers tested seropositive for influenza H5N1 antibodies and did
not report severe illness," they wrote. This means their bodies had
at some point fought off an H5N1 infection. Most were male, 18 or
younger, and were more likely than other villagers to have reported
bathing or swimming in household ponds. They all lived in wooden
houses on stilts with well or pond water as the only water source for
the family and none had known contact with the 2 children who died.

Scientists know that birds can pass influenza viruses in their
droppings and ducks, especially, can foul ponds with virus-infected
droppings. The virus can live in droppings or water for up to 6 days.
"During the study period, most participants reported repeated direct
and close poultry contact, including feeding or touching poultry
(73.3 percent), collecting poultry feces for manure (50.9 percent),
plucking feathers of sick poultry (31.1 percent), or collecting sick
and/or dead poultry with bare hands (36.8 percent)," the researchers
wrote. But, they added that the findings suggest that transmission
from sick bird to human in Cambodia was rare in 2006.

They found genetic material from the H5N1 virus in specimens taken
from ponds and pond plants. "Our results also indicate that swimming
or bathing in household ponds could be a risk factor for influenza
H5N1 virus infection. These small ponds are common and usually serve
as a water source for backyard animals and gardening," they wrote.
"Ducks usually have access to these ponds and may deposit large
amounts of feces in ponds in which children commonly bathe and play."

[Somewhat surprisingly in the light of this investigation Cambodia
has been one of the least affected countries in East Asia with only 4
human cases in 2005, 2 cases in 2006, and single cases in 2007 and
2008, all but one of which were fatal.

Risk Factors Associated with Subclinical Human Infection with Avian
Influenza A (H5N1) Virus - Cambodia, 2006. The Journal of Infectious
Diseases 2009; 199: 1744-1752 (available at

Abstract
--------
"Background
-----------
We conducted investigations in 2 villages in Cambodia where outbreaks
of influenza H5N1 occurred among humans and poultry to determine the
frequency of and risk factors for H5N1 virus transmission.

Methods
-------
During May 2006, approximately 7 weeks after outbreaks of influenza
H5N1 among poultry occurred, villagers living near households of 2
patients with influenza H5N1 were interviewed about potential H5N1
exposures and had blood samples obtained for H5N1 serological testing
by microneutralization assay. A seropositive result was defined as an
influenza H5N1 neutralizing antibody titer of 1:80 or greater, with
confirmation by Western blot assay. A case-control study was
conducted to identify risk factors for influenza H5N1 virus
infection. Control subjects, who had seronegative results of tests,
were matched with H5N1-seropositive persons by village residence,
households with an influenza H5N1-infected poultry flock, sex, and age.

Results
-------
7 (1.0 percent) of 674 villagers tested seropositive for influenza
H5N1 antibodies and did not report severe illness; 6 (85.7 percent)
were male. The 7 H5N1-seropositive persons, all of whom were aged 18
years or younger, were younger than participants who tested
seronegative for H5N1 antibodies (median age, 12.0 years vs 27.4
years; P=0.3) and were more likely than were the 24 control subjects
to report bathing or swimming in household ponds (71.4 percent vs
20.8 percent; matched odds ratio, 11.3; P=.03).

Conclusions
-----------
Avian-to-human transmission of influenza H5N1 virus remains low,
despite extensive poultry contact. Exposure to a potentially
contaminated environment was a risk factor for human infection."

One conclusion from these observations might be that infection of
humans by a non-respiratory route does not result in overt disease,
in contrast to the lethality observed following other exposure by a
respiratory route. - Mod.CP]
