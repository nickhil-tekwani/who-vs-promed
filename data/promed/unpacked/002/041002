Haiti's cholera outbreak has spread to the country's capital, where 10
deaths raised the number of people killed by the disease to 724 nationwide,
the Health Ministry said.

The deaths in Port-au-Prince fueled concern that the epidemic could take
hold in tent camps throughout the city housing many of the 1.3 million left
homeless by January's [2010] earthquake.

"The crowded and unsanitary conditions in the tent camps put people at
higher risk," said Daniel Epstein, a spokesman for an arm of the World
Health Organization, in a telephone interview from Washington. "We have
every reason to expect cholera will continue to spread."

The reported death toll climbed by 81 from a day ago, compared with an
increase of 60 the day before. Of 11 125 reported cases, 278 occurred in
the capital Port-au-Prince, according to the Haitian Health Ministry's website.
