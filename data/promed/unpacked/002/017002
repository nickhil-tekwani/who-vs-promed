NE China city reports 7 hemorrhagic fever cases
-----------------------------------------------
A city in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province has reported 7
hemorrhagic fever cases, a local health official said Monday [17 Aug 2009].

Zhang Yanjie, director of the Yichun municipal health bureau,
confirmed the outbreak in a bid to dispel rumors on the Internet that
say the city had pneumonic plague cases. The 7 people living in
different parts of the forests in Jinshantun District contracted the
disease between 28 Jul and 3 Aug [2009], he said. The patients are in
stable condition. Investigation shows that the patients drank water
or ate food contaminated by mice. Local health authorities are
ordered to ensure earlier recovery of the patients from the illness
and to step up efforts to prevent outbreaks of contagious diseases.

[The hemorrhagic fever is not identified in this report, but the
involvement of mice in its transmission suggests that it is one of
the agents responsible for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS). HFRS is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by
hantaviruses classified in the family _Bunyaviridae_. HFRS includes
diseases such as Korean hemorrhagic fever, epidemic hemorrhagic
fever, and nephropathia epidemica. The viruses that cause HFRS
include Hantaan, Dobrava-Belgrade, Seoul, and Puumala. HFRS is found
throughout the world. Hantaan virus is widely distributed in eastern
Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is
found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and Russia. Dobrava virus is
found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide.
Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can
become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to
aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after
exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when
infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into
broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth.
These viruses are not normally transmitted from person to person.

Further information would be welcomed, confirming the identity of the
etiologic agent.
