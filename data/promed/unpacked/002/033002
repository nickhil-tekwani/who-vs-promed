A total of 8 people in Los Angeles County [California] have been diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) this year [2014], health officials announced today [2 Apr 2014] as they issued a call for gay men to be vaccinated against the potentially fatal ailment.

According to the county Department of Public Health (DPH), 3 of the 8 patients either lived or were known to socialize in the West Hollywood or North Hollywood areas. The county plans to offer free vaccinations to people without health insurance beginning tomorrow [3 Apr 2014].

Dr. Jonathan Fielding, head of the county health department, said men who have sex with other men (MSM) should be vaccinated -- especially those who find partners online or who share cigarettes, marijuana or illegal drugs.

Of the 8 cases reported in the county, 4 involved MSM, including 3 who were HIV-positive, according to the county.

County DPH officials consulted with state health experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and they recommended vaccinations for all MSM, regardless of whether they consider themselves gay or bisexual, and regardless of their HIV status.

Health officials noted that the risk of contracting IMD is low among the general population, noting that the bacteria is less contagious than viruses that cause the flu. Activities that can put people at risk of the disease include: smoking, including marijuana, cigarettes and hookah; close contact with an infected person, including sharing beverages or cigarettes, kissing and coughing; and staying in group settings such as dorms, jails or shelters for extended periods.

The infection can cause brain damage, hearing loss or potentially death. Symptoms can include fever, stiff neck, skin rash, severe headaches, low blood pressure and muscle pain. The disease spreads quickly, so fast diagnosis and treatment is "imperative," health officials said.

The county plans to offer free vaccines to residents without health insurance beginning tomorrow [3 Apr 2014]. A list of clinics is available by calling the county information line at 2-1-1 or online at http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public Health) today [2 Apr 2014] confirmed reports of a total of 8 invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) cases in Los Angeles County in 2014. Of these 8, 4 cases were reported among men who have sex with men (MSM), including 3 men who were HIV-positive. Of those cases, 3 died. Public Health refused to provide any more information, so it remains unclear if any of the deaths were of gay men.

A vital difference between these cases and investigations of IMD in 2012 and 2013 is that distinct epidemiological commonalities were found among the 2014 MSM cases.

Of the 4 IMD cases among MSM, 3 reported either residence in, or socializing around, the West Hollywood and North Hollywood areas, and 3 were between 27-28 years of age (the 4th case was 50 years of age).

The nexus being West Hollywood and the illness extending to the HIV community raise the level of caution issued by the Public Health Department. Based on consultations with the Centers for Disease Control, Public Health recommends that all HIV positive men and men who have sex with men (MSM) get vaccinated for meningitis immediately.

"All HIV-positive MSM, and all MSM regardless of HIV status, who regularly have close or intimate contact with multiple partners, or who seek partners through the use of digital applications, particularly those who share cigarettes, marijuana or use illegal drugs, should visit their health provider to be vaccinated against invasive meningococcal disease," said Jonathan E. Fielding, MD, MPH, Director of Public Health and Health Officer. "At-risk MSM who don't have health insurance can obtain a free vaccination through the Department of Public Health."

Last year [2013] West Hollywood took a scare when a popular lawyer died hours after falling ill from the disease. Days later it was revealed that a 2nd gay man had succumbed to the disease [in December 2012, but Public Health had not made the connection between his death, meningitis and his sexual orientation until April 2013]. Still, despite the concerns expressed at the time about the potential for widespread contagion, neither man had an acquaintance or crossed paths, and no more gay men came down with the infection in the weeks following.

Public Health was slower to get off the dime than city and HIV/AIDS leaders council member John Duran and AHF [AIDS Healthcare Foundation] founder/president Michael Weinstein, however, so AHF dug into its own pockets to offer free meningitis vaccinations to the HIV and gay community, to phenomenal response. Within 3 days of offering the vaccine, AHF's outreach campaign had provided 2896 free vaccinations to the community. It also came to light that Public Health until November 2012 did not do any sexual orientation screening, but that a retroactive look for indicators had been done and found that gay men in West Hollywood/Los Angeles were not spreading the illness in larger than usual numbers.

"Most of the meningitis we see," Jonathan E. Fielding, the county director of public health said last year [2013], "is in family groups. Children, especially, spread the illness." Explaining last year that he understood the "level of concern" in the gay community, that meningitis should not be considered a "gay disease," and while meningitis is infectious, it is not as contagious as flu or the common cold, he said. Still, the community stakeholders and Public Health remain wary of large gatherings of people likely to share water bottles, cutlery or engage in deep kissing, such as [at] nightclubs.

AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which led the way to vaccinations last year [2013], will also be offering them at their Men's Wellness Center located at 1300 North Vermont Avenue, Suite 407, Los Angeles. For more information, please call (866) 339-2525 or visit http://www.aidshealth.org. The LA Gay & Lesbian Center offers meningococcal vaccine at its McDonald/Wright Building, located at 1625 North Schrader Boulevard, Los Angeles. It also offers free meningococcal vaccine at The Spot, located at 745 North San Vicente Boulevard, West Hollywood. For more information, please call (323) 860-5855 (McDonald/Wright) or (323) 993-7440 (The Spot) or visit http://www.lagaycenter.org. The Saban Community Clinic offers free meningococcal vaccine at its Hollywood-Wilshire Health Center, located at 5205 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles. For more information, please call (323) 769-7800 or visit http://www.sabancommunityclinic.org. In West Hollywood, the MinuteClinic at CVS/pharmacy, located at 8491 Santa Monica Boulevard, offers meningococcal vaccine for a fee, though the MinuteClinic will accept health insurance coverage. For more information, please call (866) 389-2727 or visit http://www.minuteclinic.com/CA/Los-Angeles/West-Hollywood.aspx.

[Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with the same multilocus sequence type (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM occurred in Canada and the US caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C. The US outbreak involved 22 cases in New York City between 2010 and 2013, with 7 deaths (see prior ProMED-mail posts).

In April 2013, 2 cases of IMD in Los Angeles (LA) County suggested that the outbreak in New York City may have spread to the West Coast, but the strain from one of the Los Angeles cases was said to be different from the one in New York (ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (02): (New York City) fatal, MSM, vaccination 20130520.1725339). The news report above does not state what serotypes are involved in the 8 cases that have occurred in LA County so far this year (2014), especially in the 4 MSM cases, nor if molecular typing has been done on the current strains and if so, whether these strains are related to the prior LA County strain or the European, Canadian or New York outbreak strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information on the molecular characteristics of the strains involved in the current LA County outbreak.

Molecular epidemiology has revealed that most cases of invasive meningococcal disease are caused by only a few hypervirulent clonal lineages, whereas the genetic diversity is higher in meningococci recovered from healthy carriers (Claus H, Weinand H, Frosch M, Vogel U. Identification of the hypervirulent lineages of _Neisseria meningitidis_, the ST-8 and ST-11 complexes, by using monoclonal antibodies specific to NmeDI. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(8): 3873-6; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC179822/).

However, less virulent strains have been reported to cause invasive meningococcal disease in immunocompromised HIV infected patients (Ferreira de Andrade C, Cotrim da Cunha D, Cavalcanti V, de Filippis I. Fatal meningococcal meningitis in a HIV-infected patient caused by serogroup C _Neisseria meningitidis_ belonging to the non-hypervirulent clonal complex ST-60 (cc60). Braz J Infect Dis. 2011; 15(2): 178-80, available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1413-86702011000200017).

We are told that 3 of the 4 infected MSM were co-infected with HIV, but not if their CD4 counts were low. Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).

The primary method for preventing sporadic meningococcal disease is chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics, such as rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone for persons who are known to be close contacts after a case is identified. Close contacts of patients are considered to be household members, day-care center contacts, and other persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for _N. meningitidis_ are useful for deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

In the face of multiple anonymous sexual encounters among some MSM, a mass vaccination campaign has been used to control outbreaks of IMD in MSM. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released recommendations for the use of meningococcal vaccine to control outbreaks of serogroup C meningococcal disease (CDC. Control and prevention of serogroup C meningococcal disease: evaluation and management of suspected outbreaks: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep. 1997; 46(RR-5): 13-21; available at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm).

Los Angeles County, with a population of 9 818 605, is the most populous county in the United States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California). The county seat is the city of Los Angeles, the largest city in California and the 2nd-largest city in the United States.
