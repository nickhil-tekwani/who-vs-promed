Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- update
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministries of Health of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently announced additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The 4 additional laboratory-confirmed cases reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia on [28 Mar 2014] and [2 Apr 2014] include:
- a 26 year old man from Jeddah. He became ill on [22 Mar 2014], was hospitalised on [23 Mar 2014], and died on [6 Apr 2014].
- a 26 year old man from Jeddah. He became ill on [16 Mar 2014] and has been hospitalised since [25 Mar 2014].
- a 77 year old woman from Riyadh region. She became ill on [25 Mar 2014] and is currently in a stable condition. She is not known to have a history of exposure to animals.
- a 59 year old man from Riyadh region who became ill on [22 Mar 2014]. He is not known to have contact with animals or a known case.

The additional laboratory-confirmed case reported to WHO by the Ministry of Health of the UAE on [30 Mar 2014] was:
- a 64 year old man from Abu Dhabi with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on [21 Mar 2014], was hospitalised on [25 Mar 2014] and died on [30 Mar 2014]. He had underlying medical conditions. He did not have contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case, but has had exposure to animals. The patient visited a camel farm in Harb city in Saudi Arabia on [10 Mar 2014] and visited Nezwa city in Oman for a day on [20 Mar 2014]. He owned an animal farm in the UAE with poultry and sheep, but had no recent visit to the farm. Investigation into the family and healthcare contacts is ongoing.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 211 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 88 deaths.

WHO advice
----------
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in healthcare facilities. Healthcare facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, healthcare workers, and visitors. Healthcare workers should be educated, trained, and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that healthcare workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Healthcare providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[4] Malaysia: medical screening pre-Hajj
Date: Thu 10 Apr 2014
Source: New Straits Times, Malaysian National News Agency (Bernama) report [edited]
http://www.nst.com.my/latest/health-screening-essential-to-performing-haj-this-season-1.560534


Would-be pilgrims, who failed health screenings by Tabung Haji (TH) [Malaysian hajj pilgrims fund board] will not be allowed to perform the hajj to prevent them from being infected by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which took 2 lives in Saudi Arabia to date [there have been 3 deaths reported this month, April 2014].

TH chairman Datuk Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim said TH would take precautionary measures to combat the disease, including stationing Malaysian medical specialists to assist pilgrims there. Pilgrims found not feeling well while performing hajj would be given medical assistance, he told reporters after meeting children of a Permata Insan programme to Saudi Arabia at Seri Perdana [in Putrajaya] today [10 Apr 2014].

Also present were the prime minister's wife, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, who is also the patron of Permata programme, TH group managing director and board chief executive officer Datuk Paduka Ismee Ismail, Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM) vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Asma Ismail, and Permata Insan director Prof Datuk Dr Mizan Adiliah Ahmad Ibrahim.

[According to the WHO report above, it appears as though the earlier reports on cases of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in two 26 year old males in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia were in fact, 2 separate cases and not duplicate reports as suggested in prior ProMED-mail posts (MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (21): Saudi Arabia 20140328.2364957 and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (23): Saudi Arabia 20140404.2378035). We apologize for any confusion caused by this error.

The global tally maintained by WHO for total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection as of 10 Apr 2014 is 211 including 88 deaths. According to reports on the Saudi MOH website, since 2 Apr 2014 there have been an additional 12 cases in Jeddah including 1 death (and including the 3 newly reported cases mentioned in item [2] above), and an additional 4 cases in Riyadh including 1 death. In addition there has been a media report of an announcement on the part of the UAE Ministry of Health of an additional case in Abu Dhabi (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (26): Saudi Arabia 20140409.2392763, MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (25): Saudi Arabia, UAE, RFI 20140408.2390003, and MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (24): Saudi Arabia, RFI 20140406.2385665 for details of these cases).

If the media report in item [3] above is correct, there are an additional 7 cases of MERS-CoV in Jeddah than previously reported, as the most recent Saudi MOH reports, dated 9 Apr 2014 and 10 Apr 2014, give the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Jeddah as 14, and the total number of laboratory confirmed cases in Saudi Arabia is listed as 182 including 67 deaths (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (26): Saudi Arabia 20140409.2392763 for details). We await further information as to the validity of this media report.

The media report from Malaysia contained in item [4] above, is the 1st report this moderator has seen where a country will be screening the health of prospective Hajjis prior to approval for attending the Hajj in an attempt to screen out identified high risk individuals with pre-existing comorbidities recognized to be risk factors for the development of severe disease with MERS-CoV infection. As a reminder, prior to the 2013 Hajj, the Saudi Arabian MOH and Hajj ministries requested that Hajj attendees self-screen and those with risk factors for severe disease with MERS-CoV were requested not to make the Hajj (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (43): UAE, WHO, Saudi Haj recs. 20130714.1823927).
