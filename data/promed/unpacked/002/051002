Several northern and eastern Indian states banned the sale of mustard oil
last week as the death toll in the capital climbed. Mustard oil is used
mostly in the eastern and northern states for cooking.
Hundreds of people complained of swollen limbs, vomiting and breathing and
cardiac problems after consuming adulterated oil. At least 15 people have
died and more than 500 have been treated in hospital. Dropsy is caused by
the toxic alkaloid sanguinarine present in argemone oil, which -- whether
added accidentally or deliberately -- adulterates mustard oil. Pyruvic acid
accumulates in the blood after consumption of adulterated oil. The patient
develops swollen legs and suffers from loose bowels, breathing difficulties
and, in some cases, heart failure.
Indian newspaper reports said there was evidence that cooking oil had also
been mixed with machine oil by unscrupulous businessmen.

Killer cooking oil kills four more in Delhi, dropsy toll 41
NEW DELHI, Sept 2 - Four more people died in New Delhi from dropsy caused
by adulterated mustard oil as Indian authorities stepped up efforts to
seize stocks of the oil, officials said Wednesday.
New Delhi city Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said the four deaths overnight
took to 41 the number of fatalities in New Delhi since August 21 when the
first dropsy death was reported there.
City authorities banned the sale of mustard oil here on August 26 and two
days later sounded a nationwide alert.
Twelve of India's 26 states have banned sales since the outbreak of dropsy,
which causes swelling of the limbs, accompanied by breathlessness and nausea.
Doctors say if it is not checked it can lead to glaucoma or fatal cardiac
arrest.
Health minister Vardhan said 573 people were currently in hospitals with
symptoms of dropsy while 1185 others had been released after treatment.
He said 113 new dropsy patients had been admitted to various hospitals
since Tuesday.
A report from the northern Himalayan state of Kashmir, meanwhile, said
seven people including five women were taken to hospital Wednesday with
dropsy.
The Delhi government has called for a full-scale inquiry by High Court
judges into the source of the adulterated mustard oil, which is a popular
cooking oil and a key agent for the pickle industry.
Vardhan said the government has so far pressed charges against 37 mustard
oil producers for allegedly lacing the oil with cheap petroleum lubricants
and other toxins.
Most fast-food centres in India, including subsidiaries of western chains,
have taken mustard off their menus following the outbreak.
Nepal and Bangladesh have also taken precautions against the smuggling of
contaminated mustard oil from neighbouring India.
Two men were killed in the eastern state of Bihar when police fired at a
mob protesting against the seizure of stocks of mustard oil, the Press
Trust of India reported on Wednesday.
Police opened fire Tuesday in the town of Kasnagar after some 200
protestors attacked them with stones following a raid on shops.
Five other demonstrators and a few policemen were also injured.

contaminated.
