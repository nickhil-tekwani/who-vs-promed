Serosurvey of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Domestic Animals, Gujarat, India, 2013.

Abstract
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral disease that causes a fatal hemorrhagic illness in humans. This disease is asymptomatic in animals. CCHF was 1st confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 in Gujarat State. Another notifiable outbreak occurred in July 2013, in Karyana Village, Amreli district, Gujarat State. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity against domestic animals. The present serosurvey was carried out to determine the prevalence of CCHFV among bovine, sheep, and goat populations from 15 districts of Gujarat State, India. A total of 1226 serum samples from domestic animals were screened for IgG antibodies using a CCHF animal IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Antibodies were detected in all the 15 districts surveyed; with positivity of 12 per cent, 41 per cent, and 34 per cent in bovine, sheep, and goat, respectively. This necessitates the surveillance of CCHFV IgG antibodies in animals and hemorrhagic fever cases in humans.

[CCHF has been an ongoing public health problem in Gujarat state over the past 3 years. It is not surprising that there is relatively high antibody prevalence in domestic animals in this area. As Mod.CP noted (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100810.2732), CCHF virus is tick-borne, and in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
