Indonesia: New Suspected Human Avian Influenza Case Reported from East Java
-----------------------------------------------
An 18-year-old East Java shuttlecock maker has been diagnosed with bird
flu, according to local test results announced on Sun 21 May 2006. The
Health Ministry's Director General for Disease Control, I Nyoman Kandun,
told Reuters that the victim was undergoing treatment in hospital and that
a sample of his blood will be sent to a Hong Kong laboratory recognized by
the World Health Organization (WHO) for further testing. "He was working as
a shuttlecock maker. We are still tracing where (the factory) got the
feathers," Kandun said. Most human cases of bird flu from the H5N1 virus
are believed to stem from direct or indirect contact with infected poultry.
At least 32 people have died of bird flu in Indonesia, the 2nd highest toll
after Viet Nam, where 42 have died. More than half that number have died
this year [2006].
Last week, the number of confirmed infections in one family on Indonesia's
Sumatra island hit 6, a so-called "cluster" case that raised concern about
possible human-to-human transmission of the virus. Indonesian and
international officials are still investigating the case to try to
determine the cause. Experts fear if human-to-human transmission developed,
it could lead to a pandemic. No other members of the North Sumatra village
where the family lived are known to have been infected with bird flu, the
WHO has said, but the world body has not ruled out limited human-to-human
transmission in the family cluster.
Bird flu has spread across Europe, Africa and Asia and has killed 123
people worldwide, the majority in east Asia, since reappearing in 2003.
Virtually all the victims caught the disease from poultry. The H5N1 virus
is endemic in much of Indonesia.

[If this diagnosis is confirmed by an independent WHO-designated reference
laboratory, the number of human cases of avian influenza in Indonesia will
rise to 42, and the global total will become 218. This is only the 2nd
avian influenza case to be reported from East Java. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: 2 More Suspected Human Avian Influenza Deaths
-----------------------------------------------
Local tests have confirmed 2 more people have died of bird flu in
Indonesia, a senior health ministry official said on Mon 22 May 2006. One
of the victims belonged to a Sumatran family at the center of fears of
human-to-human transmission, after 6 members of the family died this month
[May 2006] of avian influenza. "One man from the same Sumatra cluster died
this morning [22 May 2006]. He is the father of the child who died on 13
May 2006. He ran away after he received Tamiflu," said I Nyoman Kandun,
director-general of communicable disease control at the health ministry.
"He was found in the village later but refused treatment," Kandun told
reporters.
Local results on bird flu cases are not considered definitive and need
confirmation from the World Health Organization. The WHO confirmed last
week that 6 family members from Kubu Simbelang village in North Sumatra
province were infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Kandun said
there was no evidence the H5N1 virus had mutated in the Kubu Simbelang
cluster case, which has drawn global concern, because officials have found
no definitive source of the outbreak.
Most cases of human infection worldwide have been through contact with sick
poultry or their droppings. Tests on poultry in the village were positive
for the H5 subtype virus, but more tests are need to confirm whether they
were infected with H5N1. Tests on pigs have been positive for antibodies
[but no virus has been isolated from these animals - Mod.CP], suggesting
that they had been recently infected with the H5N1 virus.
Kandun said a 38-year-old man from Jakarta who died last week had also been
declared positive for bird flu by local tests.
The WHO has confirmed 32 fatalities from avian influenza in the world's 4th
most populous nation, the 2nd highest number of human deaths after Viet
Nam. The virus has spread in birds at an alarming rate in recent months,
sweeping through parts of Europe, down into Africa and across into South
Asia. It is difficult for humans to catch, but experts fear the virus could
evolve into a form that passes easily from human to human, causing a
pandemic that could kill millions.
