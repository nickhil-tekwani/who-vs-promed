I sent my brother (Dr. William Aldis, WHO Rep. in Sierra Leone) the note
about access to ribavirin. His response was as follows:
"There is a producer of ribavirin in China. All of the ribavirin we have
here is Chinese origin. It was assayed a couple of years ago and found to
be OK but I have no current info on production standards/manufacturing
practices of the source company. I need to get that info so this prompts me
to go ahead and get it sooner...."
When I get more information, I'll let you know. Of course, I doubt the
Chinese product would probably be openly marketed in the United States, but
it might be useful information for overseas clinics.

Boxes of Rebetron, used in the treatment of hepatitis C, contain not only
interferon, but 70 or 84 200 mg tablets of ribavirin (depending on the
box). If urgently needed, the material is packaged by Schering Plough who
may have ribavirin tablets available in an emergency which are not linked
to the interferon boxes.

[Problem is, use of ribavirin for treatment of Lassa fever and certain
other arbovirus infections is by intravenous dosing. As I understand it,
ICN's patent expires in less than two years and things should change at
that time. If the production of ribavirin in China and India is outside
international patent agreements, it is clear that ribavirin produced in
these countries would not be for sale in the U.S. or in many other
countries. This should be an embarrassment for all who believe that
international laws and agreements should have positive effects on the
health of humans and their livestock. Given that we went through this
exercise in 1997, it is, as Yogi Berra said, "deja vu all over again".
Nothing has changed. I expect the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will
soon be in a position to take some action. - Mod. CHC
