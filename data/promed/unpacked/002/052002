The Ministry of Health announced the control of the outbreak of Mayaro
fever registered this year [2010] in Portuguesa, which affected 77
patients from the village La Estacion, [in] Ospino municipality.
Following a technical meeting held in the State Directorate for
Environmental Health, the only health authority in Portuguesa, Carlos
Ocanto, said that the virus was completely controlled and no new cases
have been reported anywhere in the area. "The last case was registered
on 19 Apr [2010]," he stated and indicated that the Mayaro fever
outbreak was registered only in the village of La Estacion and there
is no proof that the disease was propagated to another locality in
Portuguesa.

Ocanto said that both the diagnosis and the treatment of the disease
were carried out in the area with specialists and epidemiologists,
which limited the damage from the virus and that surveillance and
vector control measures were intensified. "Although Mayaro fever is
not fatal, fundamentally it affects the joints and causes many
limitations in patients," he said.

Ocanto noted that, despite having controlled the virus outbreak,
health authorities continue monitoring in order to guarantee follow up
for affected patients and continue vigilance for any suspicion of a
new outbreak.

The [clinical] manifestations of Mayaro fever are similar to dengue
and its vector is the _Haemagogus_ mosquito, whose ideal habitat
consists of humid sites, the bark of trees, and shady areas in the
tropical forest.

The official recalled that in Portuguesa the health alert was
activated in January of this year [2010] because a patient coming from
La Estacion presented with a sudden high fever, intense pain and edema
[swelling] of the joints, skin rash, and headache, among other
symptoms characteristic of the disease. "We initiated the analyses
because the general clinical picture did not meet the criteria for any
of the diseases which we routinely look for in the state," he explained.

The symptoms of the disease are similar to those of dengue, with
manifestation in 3-5 days and, in most cases, the patient presents
with reactive arthritis as a sequela of the infection.

Portuguesa specialists in epidemiology, environmental health,
virology, emergency medicine, internists, and intensive care worked on
the study and treatment of Mayaro fever.

This viral disease is found in South American countries. It is caused
by a group A arbovirus [alphavirus], 1st isolated in 1954 in the
locality of Mayaro in Trinidad and Tobago.

[The natural hosts of Mayaro virus are forest monkeys, and the
_Haemagogus_ mosquito vector lives in the jungle canopy, brought down
to ground level when trees are felled. It is not at all easy to
distinguish Mayaro fever from dengue or other arbovirus infections on
the basis of symptoms alone. In January 2010, a French tourist
developed high-grade fever and severe joint pains following a 15 day
trip in the Amazon basin, Brazil, and was diagnosed with MAYV
infection in France. This case is the first reported in a traveler
returning from an endemic South American country to Europe.
