We recently received an alert about some cases in Houston from the Texas
Department of State Health Services:
Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) has recently been diagnosed in Houston, TX.
Health care providers should be vigilant for LGV, especially among men who
have sex with men (MSM) and/or sexually exposed to persons from Europe.
LGV, rare in the USA, has the potential for rapid spread if cases are not
identified and treated, and basic control measures such as partner
notification are not aggressively applied.
The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) encourages providers to:
- Review and apply LGV detection and treatment recommendations from the CDC.
Another information source is the Oct. 2004 MMWR report at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5342a2.htm>.
- Report possible cases to your local health department or to the Texas
Department of State Health Services Regional office for your area, or DSHS
at 1-800-705-8868. You may also contact DSHS HIV/STD Surveillance in Austin
at 512-490-2505 for reporting assistance.
