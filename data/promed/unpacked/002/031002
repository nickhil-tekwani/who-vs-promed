INFECTION CONTROL: RISKS
========================
Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 16:50:57 -0700
From: parcidia@ix.netcom.com

I spent 10 1/2 years as Infection Control Nurse in a skilled nursing
facility of 60 beds. Infection control was just becoming very important
in all facilities which housed residents of all kinds.
I, too, started from the bottom and found there was so much to learn
and nowhere to look for answers except from other nurses struggling with
the same problems which I faced. I found this to be an ideal situation
and sharing experiences with one another with open discussions gave all
of us much food for thought.
In most cases I found my residents being admitted from the acute hospitals
had a variety of infections. Many times, blood work had been done and before
the results were back the patient was transferred to our facility with
diseases unknown to us, only to learn days later the nature of, in some
cases, serious disease which put the staff and other patients at risk. A
few examples which come to mind were an active case of TB, a patient with
_Hemophilus_ influenza, Aids and Hepatitis B.

A point of interest that in most cases just good handwashing between patients
can result in effective infection control. It sounds so simple that it
almost sounds silly to be the major cause of infection. It is a difficult task
to get the point across to non-professional personnel because they tend
not to fear that which they cannot see (micro-organisms).
I find this list of info provided by you to be an excellent resource.
Thanks for all the postings.
