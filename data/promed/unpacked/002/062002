Re: Poliomyelitis update (18): cVDPV2 (Pakistan, CAR, Chad, Somalia), nOPV2 20201211.8009474

Public health interventions must result in equitable distribution of risks and benefits. This ethical norm is not satisfied when there are 17 cases of polio caused by vaccine lineage virus in 4 countries, but zero cases of polio caused by natural wild poliovirus, in the week under report. Are these children and their families informed and compensated, as required under public health ethics as enunciated by David Isaacs, 2012? (Isaacs D. An ethical framework for public health immunisation programs. N S W Public Health Bull. 2012 May-Jun; 23(5-6):111-5).

The novel OPV [oral polio vaccine] type 2 is an interesting scientific achievement. In Pakistan, about 100 health workers were killed and at least one hospital burned down, because of the belief that oral polio vaccine has some hidden motive. All injected vaccines are accepted in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Will the nOPV be acceptable in the 2 countries? What if nOPV is equated to Sabin OPV and rejected by those misguided people?

The global eradication program has the ethical responsibility to protect every child against cVDPV polio. Such protection is offered by 2 well-timed doses of IPV. One dose of IPV is already in the program since April 2016. It will take only one more dose to protect them against polio, whether caused by wild virus or by cVDPV.

The program also has an epidemiological responsibility to the world: (1) not to seed any more polio due to vaccine-progeny viruses, and (2) to conclude global polio eradication, for which every case of polio must be prevented in all countries. A 2nd dose of IPV following the currently required one dose, and feeding no more live virus to children, will make the world advance well on its way to conclude the program. When all children are protected from polio, polio disease will be eradicated. When all children are protected from polio, the virus will also die out in communities. If not, then live virus vaccines could be used to get rid of any surviving poliovirus in transmission. We must not create polio in the name of eradicating polio.

[I would like to thank Dr. T Jacob John for his very insightful comments. I personally remember having similar discussions about vaccine policies in the USA back in the mid 1970s, when outside of the sporadic imported case, all our cases were vaccine-associated cases (prior to the imported outbreak in 1979-1980).

An argument has been made for the logistic challenges of IPV and the cost of the vaccine, but has the cost of the cVDPV-associated cases been calculated to do a cost-benefit assessment? The risk benefit of recurrent cVDPV outbreaks is clear. - Mod.MPP]
