360 people sickened by drinking contaminated holy water
-------------------------------------------------------
The number of persons becoming ill after drinking Holy Water during an
Epiphany celebration in Irkutsk, a city in Siberia, has risen to 360
according to a report by the Federal Service for Consumer Protection
(FSCP) in Russia [Rospotrebnadzor].

All affected persons are responding to treatment and most of them will
be discharged. A total of 142 persons have already recovered according
to the FSCP, cited by the RIA-Novosti press agency. The majority of
affected people presented with symptoms compatible with
gastrointestinal infections, such as diarrhea, vomiting, and
high-grade fever, and they were diagnosed with rotavirus
gastroenteritis.

An epidemiological investigation established that the outbreak of
illness took place on Tue 19 Jan 2010, during an Epiphany celebration.
According to the tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church, water
collected from rivers and lakes during this religious festival, which
celebrates the baptism of Christ, has certain curative and
strengthening properties.

A spokesperson from FSCP declared that tap water from the local Church
was pure, and consistent with local hygiene regulations. However, the
water of a local lagoon, which was collected by some Orthodox
followers for drinking after being blessed by the local Church priest,
was stagnant and contaminated, explained the Sanitation Department of
Irkutsk when this massive outbreak of illness was 1st reported. "That
water does not comply with hygiene regulations because of its
microbiological and sanitary-chemical contents," they explained in a
statement. They also said that tests performed on samples of the Holy
Water found in the homes of affected persons detected rotavirus
antigens.

[Rotavirus is currently the most common cause of severe
gastroenteritis in infants and young children worldwide and of
diarrhoeal deaths in developing countries with a distinct winter
seasonality in temperate climates and year-round exposure elsewhere.
Virtually all children are infected by the time they reach 2 to 3
years of age. Most symptomatic episodes occur between 3 months and 2
years of age with a peak incidence between 7 and 15 months. Symptoms
include watery diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and
dehydration. Outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis in day-care
centers and hospitals can spread rapidly among nonimmune children,
presumably through person-to-person contacts, airborne droplets, or
contact with contaminated materials.

The global situation recently changed with the advent of new oral RV
vaccines. 3 oral rotavirus vaccines are currently licensed: a human
monovalent live attenuated rotavirus strain, RotarixTM; a pentavalent
live bovine-human reassortant vaccine, RotaTeqTM; and a lamb-derived
monovalent live attenuated strain, LLR, which is only being used in
China. An up-to-date account of rotavirus vaccines can be accessed at:
<http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index5.html>.

Rotaviruses are ubiquitous in sewage-contaminated water and as in the
situation in Irkutsk infection can occur also in adults, especially in
institutionalized or hospitalized elderly patients. Both symptomatic
and asymptomatic patients shed rotavirus in their stools for 7-10
days, but shedding can happen to last for several weeks. The virus is
highly resistant in the environment and can survive for months in
contaminated water and faeces. However in adults rotavirus
gastroenteritis is mild and self-limiting as observed in the outbreak
of illness in Irkutsk. Only the elderly and immune-compromised
individuals are at serious risk.
