Monkey deaths due to yellow fever (YF) in Parana state have increased to 46 from 40 the previous week. According to a report issued by the state secretary of health, no case has been confirmed in humans so far, although 16 suspected cases are being investigated.

Five of the new confirmed monkey cases were from Lapa, in the metropolitan region of Curitiba. This municipality had no previous record of dead monkeys due to YF. Another monkey death due to YF was in Antonio Olinto, in Southern Parana state. That city already had reported a confirmed case in monkeys.

The previous list of localities with records of monkey deaths due to YF is as follows:
Castro: 11
Ponta Grossa: 8
Lapa: 5
Candido de Abreu, Sapopema, Teixeira Soares, Antonio Olinto, Ipiranga and Piraí do Sul: 2
Balsa Nova, Mandirituba, Quatro Barros, Rio Negro, Palmeira, Sao Joao do Triunfo, Imbituva, Mallet, Prudentópolis and Sao Mateus do Sul: 1.

"The weekly newsletter is useful to monitor the outbreaks and alert on the presence of the virus in these localities", said the secretary of health, Beto Preto.

Citizens of Parana state are being summoned to local units of health to receive vaccination against YF. The vaccine is indicated for adults of up to 59 years old, and children from 9 months of age, with a booster at the age of 4 years. Pregnant and breastfeeding women, children up to 9 months of age and adults over 60, people with severe egg allergy or immunocompromised people should be vaccinated only after medical assessment.

[The current expansion of YF in South America raises concern for public health and also about potential conservation problems for susceptible non-human primate species in the continent. The virus is endemic in much of central and northern South America, and makes sporadic incursions to southern areas of the continent, like the states of Santa Catarina, Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, Misiones in Argentina, or Paraguay.

The YF virus was introduced into the Americas about 400 years ago, yet the complex interactions that were established after its introduction are far from being elucidated. There is need for more research on the eco-epidemiology of the disease in the continent, specifically on the role of each non-human primate species, and especially in the presence of the persistent anthropogenic global environmental change. - Mod.PMB
