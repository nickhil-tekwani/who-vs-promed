In addition to Hendra virus at Cawarral near Rockhampton, Biosecurity
Queensland is now managing a case of Hendra virus infection on a
property outside Bowen in North Queensland. Test results on a
deceased horse came back positive for the virus last night (Tue 8 Sep
2009) and Biosecurity Officers have immediately implemented control procedures.

Eight potential Hendra infections found
---------------------------------------
Authorities are monitoring 8 people for signs of the deadly Hendra
virus after a horse tested positive to the disease in north Queensland.

Bowen vet Dr Tim Annand euthanised the horse last week [week of 1 Sep
2009], believing it had contracted the disease, which can be
transmitted to humans. His fears were confirmed last night [8 Sep
2009] when Biosecurity Queensland revealed blood samples taken from
the horse had tested positive to the disease.

The property, located outside Bowen, has been placed under
quarantine, and Queensland's chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young
said half a dozen people who came into contact with the animal were
being monitored.

It is believed the horse may have contracted the virus from bats that
frequent melaleuca [myrtle family] trees on the property.

Dr Annand said he donned protective clothing and was careful about
what he came in contact with during and after his time with the
horse. "I had a very high level of suspicion (that this was Hendra)
before I went into this," he said. "I spent a couple of hours
preparing for it."

Still, he is concerned he may have been exposed to the virus from
another horse he treated on the same property, which died last month.
[August 2009]. He said, though he wore some protective clothing in
that instance, he did not take the same level of precautions because
the horse's symptoms were not consistent with Hendra. "(If I had it)
you would have expected that I would have shown some symptoms, but
there's very small chance of it developing down the track," he said.

Queensland deputy chief veterinary officer Rick Symons said
Queensland Health officials were attempting to locate missing samples
taken by the vet at the time.

Biosecurity Queensland officers are attempting to ascertain whether
horses on a nearby property had been exposed to the horse that died
most recently and have spoken to local residents about the disease.

The Queensland Horse Council (QHC) said the outbreak would not have
the same impact as a recent episode at Cawarral, near Rockhampton.
"There's not the same level of worry that there was with the Cawarral
case," she said.

This is the 13th known instance of Hendra virus infection since 1994.
A Rockhampton vet died on 1 Sep 2009, after catching the virus from
an infected horse he treated at the Cawarral property on 28 Jul 2009.
The funeral will be held in Rockhampton tomorrow [10 Sep 2009].

[The exposed individuals are hopefully being treated with some
antiviral drug or drug combination. If there is a contact in a
position of authority who can share the treatment of the exposed
individuals, this would be appreciated. - Mod.TG]
