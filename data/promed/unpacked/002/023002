More than 600 people have been infected by a new disease called chikungunya.

Chikungunya is a mosquitoborne viral disease that was 1st discovered in parts of Africa, Asia, and Europe. The disease was also detected in New Caledonia and just recently, in Vanimo's urban area, in the West Sepik Province.

The disease was 1st reported in June this year [2012]. Between June and September, more clinic presentations were discovered with symptoms similar to those of malaria.

"There is no need to panic as no deaths have been reported yet. Deaths due to chikungunya [virus] infection are usually rare," secretary for health Pasco Kase stated in a media release yesterday [9 Oct 2012].

Early this month, the Institute of Medical Research (IMR) confirmed that 14 out of 52 samples sent for testing were positive for chikungunya. Further investigations into the outbreak are currently undertaken by the National Department of Health (NDOH) and the IMR. The World Health Organization (WHO) is providing technical assistance.

Since June to this month, a total of 633 patients suspected of having symptoms of chikungunya have been reported from Vanimo hospital. The outbreak is localised to the town vicinity and its satellite communities.

Chikungunya fever is a viral illness transmitted through the bite of infected _Aedes_ mosquitoes. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are also the vectors of dengue fever, and are known day-biters (mosquitoes that bite only during day time), usually in the morning hours or in the early evenings.

According to WHO, chikungunya is characterised by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by joint pains. Other common signs and symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rashes. The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually ends within a few days or weeks. Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years. Occasional cases of eye, neurological, and heart complications have been reported, as well as gastrointestinal complaints. Serious complications are not common; but in older people, the disease can contribute to the cause of death. Often symptoms in infected individuals are mild and may go unrecognised or be misdiagnosed in areas where dengue occurs.

The name "chikungunya" derives from a Kimakonde language verb that means "to become contorted" and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pain.

WHO states there are no specific drugs to cure the disease. Treatment is directed primarily at relieving the symptoms. There is no commercial chikungunya vaccine. The Department of Health states that patients in its acute phase are treated with paracetamol tablets and are requested not to take aspirin during this time due to a possible rise in the risk of bleeding. Patients are also advised to seek early treatment with bed rest and sufficient intake of fluids.

Meanwhile, the NDOH and WHO will assist provincial health authorities to carry out appropriate control activities.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of chikungunya virus infections on Papua New Guinea. Appearance of chikungunya virus infections in places where _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes are abundant is not surprising, in a world where rapid international transport of viremic people is possible with modern long distance aircraft.
