I am wondering, Dr. Chaitanya S. Buch did not mention the infectious status
(or serologic status) of persons in the study.
He said: "Therefore the results observed may be seen as a consequence of
the modification of an intrinsic factor that influences the predisposition
of plaque rupture.
There are at least two possible explanations for the findings of the
present study. First, roxithromycin, through its antichlamydial activity,
may suppress the reactivation of chronic infection within the
atherosclerotic plaque. Secondly roxithromycin also has antiinflammatory
activity, this action may attenuate the persistent inflammation in the
plaque leading to a more stable state."
Perhaps roxithromycin gave the results due to another reason - that it was
effective against other unmeasured/undocumented infectious agents, such as
_H. pylori_ or cytomegalovirus, or other. Has this been considered? Also, is
this study going to be published?

1. The referred trial is reported in Lancet 1997,350:404-407
2. From that study (Lancet) "Other pathogens such as _H. pylori_ and
cytomegalovirus are being investigated. In the present study, treatment was
randomly allocated independent of baseline _C. pneumoniae_ IgG titres and no
differences were observed in baseline characteristics of patients.
Therefore, the results observed may be seen as a consequence of the
modification of an intrinsic factor that influences the predisposition of
plaque rupture......
To our knowledge the present study is the first prospective study that
focused on the anti-inflammatory and anti-chlamydial effect of
roxithromycin. Further large-scale trials are required to confirm our
findings and more research into the mechanisms involved is needed."
