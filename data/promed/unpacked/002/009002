Measles Outbreak In Nimba
-------------------------
There has been a report of an outbreak of strange [i.e., strange in
the sense that unusually the illness is being observed in young adults
rather than children - Mod.CP] measles in Nimba County, a place that
is located in the northern part of Liberia and has experienced an
influx of refugees since the outbreak of the post-elections crisis in
neighboring Ivory Coast [Cote d'Ivoire].

However, the Minister of Health and Social Welfare, Walter T.
GwenIgale, has confirmed that indeed there is an outbreak of strange
measles in that county which [is currently affecting] young adults,
something that is [considered] strange. Also he added that the
outbreak had left one dead in the county. The Ministry has already
dispatched a team there to do all it could to bring the situation
under control.

Meanwhile, research done by this paper has shown that such outbreaks
have also happened in Australia involving predominantly young adults
in Victoria, which spread to South Australia between February and May
1999. And that in some countries where universal measles vaccination
has been introduced over an extended period of time, young adults are
emerging as the group most at risk of measles infection; approximately
85 percent of the 75 noticed cases confirmed with measles in that
outbreak were born between 1968 and 1981 (aged between 18 and 30
years). These young adults were most likely to be susceptible to
infection because of the timing of changes to measles vaccination
practices in Australia.

Prior to the introduction of vaccines, most people acquired immunity
through infection with wild measles virus in childhood. The reduction
in circulating wild measles virus and low vaccine coverage left a
cohort of young Australian adults with varying susceptibility to
infection.

[The moderator's assumption that the term "strange" should be
interpreted as meaning "young adults" implies that the population
principally at risk of contracting measles virus infection (children)
has been well protected by comprehensive vaccination, leaving only
only a proportion of young adults still at risk of infection (as
discussed in the above press report). This interpretation needs to be
substantiated and, further information from Liberia would be welcomed.
