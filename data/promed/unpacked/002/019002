Wangaratta racecourse [Victoria] is in lockdown following the detection of the highly contagious strangles disease in a horse stabled on the course. Today's [13 Apr 2016] 8-race program, which was to start at 1pm, was abandoned after the disease was detected in the horse about 11am.

Horses from the barn where the strangles was detected had worked this morning on the track and used the swimming pool. The horse with the strangles had not used the facilities today, but there is an incubation period where strangles is undetectable in horses.

Strangles is a contagious upper respiratory tract infection of horses which can be spread through mucus which has been discharged on racing equipment and facilities. It cannot be passed onto humans.

A Cranbourne [Victoria] trainer was the only trainer to arrive at the course, about half an hour before the opening race where he had the 1st starter entered. He unloaded the horse, along with another 2 starters which were to race later in the program, before stewards told him to put them back into the float and take them home. He was told to disinfect his float. He said he would take the 3 horses -- all with the same owner -- back to the owner's property where they would be isolated for a few days and observed before being brought back into work. "They have been inoculated and we have the veterinary documentation, so it's nothing serious for us," he said.

"They should have had someone on the gate as soon as they found out -- it was 11:30am when we got there, only half an hour before the time you have to be there. We were there for 5 minutes before we were told to put the horses back onto their float." The trainer said he was bewildered that a television crew could film his float leaving the course, yet no-one had locked the gate to stop him entering the course.

Racing officials had contacted trainers to inform that the meeting would not go ahead and turned trucks and floats away from the gates before they were locked. Steward Peter Ryan, who was to chair the meeting, said a case of strangles was reported to Racing Victoria's [RV's] veterinary department. The horse diagnosed with strangles is in a barn near the main gate and adjacent to the carpark.

RV's veterinary department will inform Wangaratta trainers today on how to handle the outbreak and when the track and facilities will reopen.

[Wangaratta is in northeast Victoria; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wangaratta.

Strangles is caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_). The bacteria typically infect the upper airway and lymph nodes of the head and neck. The disease has been in the equine population for centuries, and was 1st reported in 1251. The infection is highly contagious in horse populations, particularly affecting young horses, and can recur on farms with previous outbreaks of the disease.

Though strangles is highly contagious and can affect many horses on a farm, most horses with infection recover without complication. Complications from the infection include spread of the infection to lymph nodes other than the head and neck (also known as metastatic infection or bastard strangles), immune mediated disease (such as purpura hemorrhagica), muscle disease and pain and lack of milk production. Horses that develop complicated infections typically require antibiotic and additional therapies based on veterinary examination.

The hallmark clinical signs of infection are fever (temperature over 101.5 F), nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes (in the space between the lower jaw bones), which ultimately abscess. Purulent nasal discharge is typically present, although it may initially be clear. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes (located deep behind the throatlatch) may also become enlarged and abscess. These will sometimes drain into the guttural pouches, which are air-filled spaces within the head that are an expansion of the Eustachian tubes. Guttural pouch infection and pus accumulation (empyema) are often the result of retropharyngeal lymph nodes that abscess and rupture into the guttural pouches. Guttural pouch infection may also occur from bacterial entrance through the pharynx (throat). Anorexia, depression, and difficulty swallowing may also accompany signs of infection.

Nasal discharge from the infected horse is the largest source of contamination. Sources of infection can be nose to nose contact with an infected horse, sharing contaminated water buckets, feed tubs, twitches, tack and clothing and equipment of handlers who work with infected horses.

Once the horse comes into contact with a potential source of infection, it may take 3-14 days after exposure before the horse will show the 1st clinical sign of strangles (fever). Based on this information, a minimum isolation period for introduction of new horses to the farm should be 14 days.

Clinical signs of strangles are highly suggestive of the diagnosis. There are 3 methods to confirm the diagnosis of strangles:
- Culture of the bacteria from the nasal discharge or abscess
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects DNA of the _S. equi_ bacteria
- Blood test (serology) that measures a titer to a specific protein (SeM) of _S. equi_

Antibiotic therapy remains controversial for the treatment of strangles. Complicated cases and those requiring tracheostomy for management of respiratory distress generally do require antibiotic and other supportive therapies. There is some evidence that treatment with antibiotics (such as penicillin) at the 1st sign of fever and in horses with no lymph node enlargement may prevent infection. However, early antibiotic treatment will also prevent these cases from developing immunity to the infection, and subsequently makes them susceptible to reinfection sooner.

Vaccination is one method for prevention and control of infection with _S. equi_. However, vaccination cannot guarantee disease prevention. With strangles, vaccination will likely reduce the severity of disease in the majority of horses that are infected. Available vaccines can be administered by intramuscular and intranasal routes. Improper administration of the vaccination can result in poor protection against infection and/or complications at the site of injection; therefore, administration by your veterinarian is recommended. The intranasal vaccination results in the best local immunity.

Vaccination is generally not recommended during an outbreak of strangles.

When an outbreak or potential outbreak occurs, it is important to work with your veterinarian. Strangles is a reportable disease in some states. Isolation of the affected animal or animals is important. Other measures to take include taking the temperature of all horses on the farm at least twice daily. Normal rectal temperature is 99-102 F. Monitoring the rectal temperature and isolating horses at the 1st sign of fever is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of infection. Infected horses can transmit the bacteria to healthy horses 1-2 days after they develop a fever.

Unexposed horses should be kept in a "clean" area and ideally should have separate caretakers, cleaning equipment, grooming equipment, water troughs and pasture. People and equipment can transfer the infection from horse to horse. Extreme care, hand washing and disinfection of supplies must be observed by everyone involved. If different individuals cannot care for infected and healthy horses, then healthy horses should always be dealt with 1st.
