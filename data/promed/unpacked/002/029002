Three more people have been killed by [vancomycin resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (VRSA). The deaths bring the toll in Hong Kong to 4 and
heighten fears about over-prescription of antibiotics.
The South China Morning Post reported in February [1999 that a middle-aged
woman suffering from cancer was killed by the bacterium after 2 weeks of
antibiotic treatment failed at a public hospital. It was the first case
reported in the territory.
University of Hong Kong microbiologists, using advanced testing techniques,
have confirmed that 2 other deaths at the same hospital were caused by
the [organism. A fourth death has been detected at a separate hospital.
The [case fatality rate for VRSA [infections is almost 100 per cent.
University of Hong Kong microbiologist Dr Ho Pak-leung said last night that
the patients who died were all chronically ill and were being given
long-term antibiotic treatment.
Dr Ho said it was alarming the drug resistance of _Staphylococcus aureus_
was higher here than in the United States and Europe. Abuse of antibiotics
is a global concern because it induces drug resistance in bacteria, which
can change their make-up to survive.
Since the late 1970s, some strains, known as methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), have been resistant to the antibiotics
methicillin and cloxacillin. Now the bacteria are resistant to vancomycin,
[often the best or only alternative for treatment of MRSA - Mod.ES.
After the first death from VRSA was detected, the university began a
screening programme. The findings, published in the international medical
journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, showed that of the 164 _Staphylococcus
aureus_
isolates from patient blood collected between July 1997 and June 1998,
52 were resistant to methicillin, and 3 also resistant to vancomycin.
The 3 infected with VRSA died of bacteremia and multi-organ failure.
Figures from the Department of Health show that of the 392 _Staphylococcus
aureus_ isolates collected from its outpatient clinics, 14 per cent were
resistant to methicillin, compared with 30 to 50 per cent at public
hospitals. "That means the drug resistance problem is becoming more serious
and has started to spread from the hospital to the community," Dr Ho said.
Hong Kong is only the fourth place in the world to report VRSA. The
[organism was first found in Japan in 1997, where a boy with an infected
surgical wound did not respond to 29 days of vancomycin treatment. It has
also been found in the US and France.
