Farmers need to bring sheep in from hills. Farmers claim that a new
system to allow controlled movement of livestock in the wake of the
foot-and-mouth crisis is in chaos. Many farmers have been unable to
move their livestock since the start of the outbreak 7 months ago. The
transport ban has threatened special problems at this time of year as
grass starts to run out on the hills and animals are normally moved to
market or for breeding.
Last month ministers said new rules would allow more animals to be
transported under a complex licensing system to prevent any further
spread of the disease. The system was supposed to start last week.
The spokesman for the Department of Food, Environment and Rural
Affairs (Defra) said 3000 movement licences had gone out to farmers in
counties declared free from the disease. The East Midlands and
Leicestershire were the latest regions to be declared "foot-and-mouth
free" after 3 months without a case.
Since the start of the outbreak there have been 2027 cases with 3 898
000 animals slaughtered and 5000 animals awaiting slaughter.

[Yesterday, one new outbreak was reported. As the autumn begins it is
important to be able to bring flocks down onto more sheltered ground.
Another problem is the urgent need to sell off excess stock and
culls. - Mod.MHJ
