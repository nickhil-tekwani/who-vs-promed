Anthrax kills 44 hippos in eastern Zambia: minister
---------------------------------------------------
The Zambian government on Thursday [6 Oct 2016] confirmed an outbreak of anthrax, which has killed 44 hippos in Chama district [Muchinga province] in the country's eastern region.

Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya said the outbreak of the disease could be due to low water levels, with the 1st case recorded on 22 Sep [2016].

He said in a ministerial statement in parliament that people in the district have since been advised against eating hippo meat because as it was infected with anthrax. "We have dispatched an emergency multisectoral team to Chama and we are sensitizing people in the area not to eat hippo meat," he said.

A mobile laboratory has also been set up in the area and sufficient machines have been provided, he added.

[The previous reports were not clear as to the 44 cases and we mistakenly assumed these hippo cases were human cases. It appears that there were 22 human cutaneous cases as stated in the last report. Obviously someone has said something to someone and they had 44 hippo carcasses. Obviously a great temptation for those wanting free meat. There should be adequate opportunities to sample the remaining dead hippo. As we have advised before, with carcasses that have been dead for more than 3 days it is best to go straight to the nasal turbinates for tissue to sample. The anthrax spores will remain viable there for at least 3 years in our experience. - Mod.MHJ
