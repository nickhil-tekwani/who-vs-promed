HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (9)
=====================================
Subject: BIH on PROMED
Since the informations about hantaviruses and HFRS in Bosnia and
Herzegovina are daily on PROMED, I decided to write a few sentences
concerning this subject.
The country of Bosnia and Herzegovina is for decades well known to
be a highly endemic region of HFRS. Based upon published data and
our own research experience we are aware of the simultaneous
coexistence of four hantaviruses in this part of the Balkans: Fojnica
virus (identical to prototype Hantaan), Vranica virus (identical to
Hallnaes B1 [= strain designation of Puumala virus. Mod.]), Dobrava
virus (originately isolated in our laboratory) and Seoul virus.
Therefore the proper laboratory assays (e.g. confirmatory tests)
should be used when the diagnosis of HFRS cases are suspected. The
situation is even more confused since the same region is endemic for
leptospirosis as well as for rickettsial diseases. I think that
differential diagnosis of those infections is important since the
clinical pictures are similar, and even double infections with
hantaviruses and leptospira are documented.
A year ago I wrote a chapter about Hantaviruses and the diseases they
are causing in the Balkans for the Monographs in Virology (eds. Morse
S. and LeDuc JW) which summarised historical review, major outbreaks,
epidemiology, hantavirus characterization and clinical features of
HFRS in the Balkans.
Our laboratory was recognized as a WHO Collaborating Centre for
Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fever Reference and Research with regard of
our ten years experience in research and laboratory diagnostic work in
this field.
Therefore our laboratory is willing to give the neccessary support for
diagnosis or confirmation of any of the suspected infections.
