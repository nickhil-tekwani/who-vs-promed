Namibia has detected an outbreak of lung sickness among cattle in the western part of the Kavango region, officials said on Friday [18 Mar 2022]. According to Agriculture Ministry chief veterinary officer Albertina Shikongo, farmers alerted veterinary officers after observing some deaths and clinical signs in their cattle.

She said lung sickness was confirmed by the Windhoek Veterinary Laboratory from 10 Mar 2022 and that the source of infection is under investigation. "In Africa, lung sickness is known to cause greater losses in cattle than any other disease because it is highly contagious and with a mortality rate of 50 per cent," Shikongo said. Lung disease, which affects cattle and water buffaloes, is caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subspecies _mycoides_ SC [small colony], a type of bacteria that attack the lungs of susceptible animals.

The agriculture ministry has put a complete ban on the movement of live animals around the affected areas until further notice, Shikongo said. She said surveillance teams have been deployed to the region, located in northeastern Nambia, to assess the extent of the outbreak, and that vaccination of all cattle in the region against lung sickness will be conducted in the next few weeks.

["Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is a disease of cattle and water buffalo caused by _Mycoplasma mycoides_ subsp. _Mycoides_ (_M. mycoides_). As the name suggests, it attacks the lungs and the membranes that line the thoracic cavity (the pleura) causing fever and respiratory signs such as labored or rapid respiration, cough, and nasal discharges.

"Because it is highly contagious with a mortality rate of up to 50%, it causes significant economic losses. CBPP is a prominent cattle disease in Africa.

"CBPP is a disease listed by the OIE in the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Members are obligated to report occurrences of the disease according to the standards in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

"CBPP is one of the diseases for which the OIE has established an official procedure for recognition of status. The OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code specifies the steps a country must follow in order to be officially recognized by the OIE as free of CBPP.

"Transmission of the disease occurs through direct contact between an infected and a susceptible animal, which becomes infected by inhaling droplets disseminated by coughing. Since some animals can carry the disease without showing signs of illness, controlling the spread is more difficult.

"There is no evidence of transmission through fomites (inanimate objects such as clothing, implements, or vehicles), as the organism does not persist in the environment.

"Humans are not known to be susceptible to CBPP, so there is no public health risk.

"CBPP was known in Europe as early as the 16th century. It was spread throughout the world by increased international trade in live cattle in the 2nd half of the 19th century. Stamping out policy eradicated the disease from many countries; however, it currently persists in sub-Saharan Africa."

During the 82nd OIE General Session held the week of 27 May 2021, Namibia received the OIE endorsement as a country having an official control program for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP).

West Kavango province, located in the northern part of Namibia, borders Angola. A previous outbreak of CBPP was reported by Namibia to the OIE in September 2021. It was located in the Omusati province, western to Kavango, similarly bordering Angola.
