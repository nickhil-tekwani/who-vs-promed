Measles in Italy -- background
------------------------------
Regarding the recent measles outbreak in Apulia, Italy [see:
ProMED-mail post Measles - Italy (Apulia) 20070404.1146], a gradual
decrease in measles rates may reflect the fact that vaccine coverage
for Italy has exceeded 80 percent only since 2002. See graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles-italy.jpg>.

Outbreaks of measles in Italy:

1996 to 1997 -- An outbreak (1642 cases seen at one hospital) was
reported in Palermo.
2002 -- An outbreak (24 000 clinical cases; 368 hospitalized; 13
encephalitis; 3 fatal) was reported in Campania. The rate among
children below age 15 years was 3750 per 100 000.
2003 -- An outbreak (1217 cases) was reported in Calabria and Puglia.
2003 -- An outbreak (26 cases) was reported in South Tyrol.
2006 -- An outbreak (40 cases) was reported in Grosseto.
2006 -- Outbreaks (187 cases in 3 outbreaks) were reported in the
Roma/Sinti populations of South Tyrol (17 cases), Sardinia (9 cases),
and Lazio (161 cases).
