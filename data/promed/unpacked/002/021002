Raw Oysters Cause Record Illnesses
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ in raw oysters and other shellfish killed one
person and sickened 208 others in the United States and Canada last summer,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. The illnesses
were reported in Washington state, California, Oregon, Utah, Alaska,
Maryland, Hawaii and British Columbia in Canada during July and August.
All 209 people tested positive for _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, bacteria
commonly found in shellfish that can cause diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps
and fever. Most patients reported eating raw oysters; some reported eating
mussels, crabs and other shellfish. The oysters had higher-than-normal
concentrations of the bacteria, perhaps because of warmer water in the
Pacific Ocean, the CDC said.
The CDC is urging people not to eat raw or undercooked shellfish. Cooking
shellfish will kill the bacteria.
