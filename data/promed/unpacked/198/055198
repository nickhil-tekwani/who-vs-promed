Consumers should avoid eating fresh bagged spinach after an outbreak
of _E. coli_ in 8 states killed 1 person and sickened at least 49,
federal health officials announced Thu night, 14 Sep 2006. The
outbreak involves a virulent strain of _E. coli_ known as O157:H7,
which produces a toxin that can lead to bloody diarrhea, kidney
failure and, in rare cases, death.
State and federal health officials have used genetic screening tools
to confirm that all 50 people sickened by the disease suffered from
the same bacteria, said Dr. David Acheson of the Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA. But health officials still
have no idea which food manufacturer may be to blame. The 1st case
was reported on 23 Aug 2006 and the most recent on 3 Sep, Dr. Acheson
said. "It's increasing by the day," Dr. Acheson said. "We may be at
the peak, we may not. We're giving preliminary data here."
Dr. Acheson said the FDA became aware of a possible outbreak on Wed,
13 Sep 2006. But delays are common as information is gathered and
compared, he said. "It takes quite some time for someone to be
exposed, get sick, get sick enough to see the doctor, have it
examined, have a sample sent to a lab, have it confirmed positive and
have it be put in the public health system," Dr. Acheson said.
Dr. Acheson described the outbreak as "significant." It is broadly
distributed across the country. Twenty cases -- including the only
confirmed death -- occurred in Wisconsin. There were 11 cases in
Utah, 5 in Oregon, 4 in Indiana, 3 each in Idaho and Michigan, 2 in
New Mexico and 1 in Connecticut, he said. Most of those affected have
been women. Although this strain of _E. coli_ commonly affects
children, many patients have been older than 20, Dr. Acheson said.
Health officials are by no means certain that bagged spinach is the
culprit. When patients have a confirmed case of the disease, health
officials ask the victims many questions about what they ate over the
previous weeks. Bagged fresh spinach is the only food that patients
so far have had in common, Dr. Acheson said. Asked if consumers
should also avoid bagged salads, Dr. Acheson answered somewhat
tentatively, saying, "At this point, there is nothing to implicate
bagged salad."
The CDC estimates that the O157:H7 strain causes 73 000 infections
and 61 deaths a year in the USA. The bacteria can live in cows'
intestines without making the animals sick, and most infections in
people come from eating undercooked hamburgers (cooking to at least
160 degrees Fahrenheit destroys the bacteria and the toxin they
produce). In 2002, 19 million pounds of raw beef were recalled
because of O157:H7 contamination.
In a notorious outbreak in 1993, 4 children died from the infection
after eating contaminated Jack in the Box hamburgers. Raw milk and
unpasteurized cheese can also spread the bacteria. Outbreaks have
been linked to petting zoos where children touched farm animals that
carried the bacteria.
Produce can also become contaminated by animal wastes or unsanitary
water, and outbreaks have been caused by sprouts, lettuce, and
unpasteurized fruit juice or cider. In 1996, 1 child died and 66
others became ill after drinking unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
Thorough washing should make it safe to eat most produce raw, except
for alfalfa sprouts.
But Dr. Acheson advised consumers to avoid bagged spinach altogether,
although he noted that thorough cooking killed the bacteria.

[The investigation will continue to better elucidate the source of
this outbreak. It is likely that the reason that the cases have been
in adult women relates to the fact that, whatever the vehicle is, it
is ingested more by this cohort than by children. Spinach would fit
that profile. ProMED thanks Brent Barrett & Carla Rosenfield for
submitting similar reports. - Mod.LL/JW]

The FDA is issuing an alert to consumers about an outbreak of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 in multiple states that may be associated with the
consumption of produce. To date, preliminary epidemiological evidence
suggests that bagged fresh spinach may be a possible cause of this outbreak.
Based on the current information, FDA advises that consumers not eat
bagged fresh spinach at this time. Individuals who believe they may
have experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach
are urged to contact their health care provider.
"Given the severity of this illness and the seriousness of the
outbreak, FDA believes that a warning to consumers is needed. We are
working closely with the CDC and state and local agencies to
determine the cause and scope of the problem," said Dr. Robert
Brackett, Director of FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied
Nutrition (CFSAN).
_E. coli_ O157:H7 causes diarrhea, often with bloody stools. Although
most healthy adults can recover completely within a week, some people
can develop a form of kidney failure called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(HUS). HUS is most likely to occur in young children and the elderly.
The condition can lead to serious kidney damage and even death.
To date, 50 cases of illness have been reported to the CDC, including
8 cases of HUS and 1 death. At this time, the investigation is
ongoing and states that have reported illnesses to date include:
Connecticut, Idaho, Indiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin.
FDA will keep consumers informed of the investigation as more
information becomes available.
