Hepatitis B cases rise in Dehradun, doctors fear epidemic in future
-------------------
Sending alarm bells ringing among health providers, the number of hepatitis B cases in Dehradun is on a gradual rise. As per experts, nearly 10 percent of all the monks in the Tibetan community have been infected by the virus, which is spreading fast among the general population of the city.

"Dehradun has primarily 4 centers where Tibetan communities reside -- Sakya, Deklying, Clement Town and Manduwala -- where we have conducted hepatitis screening and awareness camps. Our study has found that a large number of monks have been infected by the virus," said noted specialist PK Agrawal, talking to TOI. "The virus is primarily bloodborne or sexually transmitted. But as they are monks and celibate, there is a high possibility that they were infected by the blades used for shaving their heads," the doctor added.

As per Agrawal, since the opening of the blood bank in Dehradun 9 years ago, nearly 2 lakh [200 000] units of blood has been donated by people, out of which more than 600 cases were found to be hepatitis B positive, 0.3 percent. Those born after 1993 would be at low risk of hepatitis B because the Centre made it compulsory to vaccinate them. Older citizens, however, are still at risk and need to be targeted.

Meanwhile, Doon Women Hospital has also confirmed that, on an average 1 patient is diagnosed with the virus every day at the hospital and if awareness is not spread the disease might become an epidemic. "Hepatitis B can be deadlier than AIDS because people are not aware that the end result of the virus is cancer. In the initial stage, mild jaundice is observed among the patients followed by cirrhosis in liver and then carcinoma, said Sunita Singh, senior pathologist at the hospital. "The virus has a higher chance of spreading through all the surgical interventions where blood is involved, even in hospitals. Awareness is crucial," Singh added. According to her, all the women diagnosed with the virus in the hospital had contracted it from their husbands, showing the fast pace at which hepatitis B was spreading.

PK Agrawal has claimed that he has identified cases from the age group of 4 to 80. "Clearly, age has no relevance and the best solution is to get immediately vaccinated," he said. As per experts, the virus is fast spreading among Jaunsari and Muslim communities because of their tradition of multiple partners and less awareness about the virus. Experts feel that in the coming days, hepatitis B will be a major killer as far as communicable diseases are concerned.

[In many reports such as this, it is difficult to assess how many of the patients have acute hepatitis B and how many have chronic infection when diagnosed. They can be differentiated serologically by the presence of IgM anti-hepatitis B core antigen in the blood in acute cases. When hepatitis B is acquired in adulthood, generally 5-10 percent of those affected will be chronic carriers with a risk of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. However, if the disease is acquired neonatally from vertical transmission from infected mother to neonate, the risk of that individual being a chronic carrier can be 95 percent. The hepatitis B vaccine is quite effective and safe in preventing infection. In chronically infected individuals, there are a number of medications that can be useful in treatment include lamuvidine, tenofovir and adefovir, all used in HIV treatment as reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Dehradun is the capital of the Indian state of Uttarakhand in northern India, which can be seen on a map at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttarakhand#/media/File:India_Uttarakhand_locator_map.svg - Mod.LL
