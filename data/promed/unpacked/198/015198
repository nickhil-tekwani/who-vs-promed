Chronic wasting disease [CWD] in deer has spread farther west into
the province [Alberta] and within 5 years will likely be found at
Edmonton's outskirts and in Calgary, says a University of Alberta
biologist.

Dave Coltman came to that conclusion after looking at the latest
testing results and map posted by Alberta Sustainable Resource
Development last week [week of 14 Feb 2011].

Altogether, 17 new cases were found in the nearly 4200 deer tested
since September 2010. That brings the total number of wild deer cases
found in Alberta since 2005 to 91.

CWD is caused by a prion, similar to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, which causes deer to slowly waste away.

In the past 2 years, the government has relied on a hunter
surveillance program to track the spread of the disease.

Government staff collect the heads of deer killed by hunters in
specific wildlife management areas where past cases have been found.
They also test deer hunted in areas close to past cases. Prior to
that, they had also used an aggressive winter cull program to reduce
the densities of deer in infected areas.

Coltman, a biology professor who studies CWD, said the most recent
map of the cases shows there are 4 new ones in a new wildlife
management unit. He said the disease, as expected, is moving along
river valleys. "Those are like superhighways for CWD and deer."

There are likely many more cases that haven't been found, he said.
"If we're going to continue to have surveillance to guess where the
leading edge of this thing is, we're going to have to go another set
of management units further west, particularly in the south. It's at
the gates of Calgary now, basically."

Alberta Sustainable Resource Development spokesman Darcy Whiteside
said the testing program is nearing completion for the season. When it
wraps up, they will evaluate their disease management program to see
how it might change next season.

There is no evidence that the disease in its current form can infect
humans. But research published earlier this year [2011] out of the
United States suggests that over time, as the strain adapts over
successive generations in the wild, it could become progressively more
transmissible to humans. The study, published in The Journal of
Biological Chemistry, said the transformation could take years or
decades, or might not even happen. But it also notes that it is likely
that CWD prions are progressively accumulating in the environment,
since they bind tightly to soil and can remain infectious for a long
time.

Coltman said there's a delicate line to walk when talking about the
risks associated with the disease. He doesn't want to sound alarmist,
but he also said that everyone working in the field expects there will
come a day when a new form of a prion disease evolves from CWD and it
could become transmissible to humans. The public wants to know what
the chance is that that will happen. "It's a very small number. ...
But the day that it does happen it will blow up. And people will say,
'Wow, we let it go and now look where we are.' "

Some hunters, when they get a call telling them their animal was
positive, say they've already eaten the animal and don't care.

"We tell people you can store it in the freezer until you get the
results, but the (U. Centers for Disease Control) has found no link
between eating deer or elk and prion disease in humans," Whiteside
said.

The World Health Organization recommends a precautionary approach,
though, and says any animal product known to be infected with any
prion disease should not be consumed by humans.

"Personally, I'd think twice about eating a deer if I knew it was
positive," Coltman said.

[Chronic wasting disease (CWD), one of the transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy diseases, has been in the US since the late 1950's or
early 1960's.

The research mentioned in this article is somewhat speculative. The
more surveillance we do the more likely we are to find the disease. It
does not necessarily mean the disease is moving, but that we are
better at recognizing it and finding it.

There has been much speculation and some research on how the disease
may move. Among the research is prions in the kidneys, and thus likely
in the urine. Many hunters use urine to lure deer, but the urine from
deer is shipped all over the country. Perhaps it came from deer
unknowingly infected with CWD?

The research continues on this disease. - Mod.TG
