More than 45 000 animals die of foot-and-mouth disease
------------------------------------------------------
A foot-and-mouth [FMD] epidemic has broken out in 39 provinces,
affecting more than 150 000 head of cattle. More than 45 000 animals
have died or been destroyed, including over 5000 buffalos, 938 cows,
37 760 pigs, and 329 goats.

These figures were from the report delivered by the Animal Health
Department at a meeting in Hanoi on 24 Jun 2011 to sum up the
prevention of the disease.

At the meeting, Hoang Van Nam, head of the department under the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, stressed that the
epidemic had spread more quickly than previous years because of the
carelessness of local inhabitants and authorities. Nam said they did
not closely manage the epidemic hot spots and did not destroy diseased
cattle as instructed.

Bad weather and the habit of tending buffalos and cows on a small
scale contributed to the high risk of epidemics, Nam added.

The Animal Health Department has asked provinces to work out
programmes to prevent the disease, organize vaccinations for 2011, and
use the correct vaccines. The aim is to contain FMD in 2015.

Addressing the meeting, deputy minister of agriculture and rural
development Diep Kinh Tan warned that FMD virus strains are constantly
evolving. He said Viet Nam has found effective vaccines to fight the
disease, but veterinary agencies must continue to closely monitor the
epidemic.

[The FMD epizootic in Viet Nam started in June 2007, as officially
reported by the veterinary authorities to the OIE; on 23 Feb 2008 it
was declared as endemic. According to the 2010 annual report, 280
outbreaks were recorded during that year; ring vaccinations were
applied in 98 500 cattle and 135 500 buffaloes.

According to the website of the South East Asia FMD Campaign
(SEAFMD), no outbreaks were recorded during June-August 2010; in
September 2010, the disease recurred (34 outbreaks), followed by 45
outbreaks in October, 69 in November, 70 (December), 247 (January
2011), 279 (February), 46 (March), and none during April and May 2011
(no reports submitted?!). All serotyped isolates, during the period
September 2010 to March 2011, were of serotype O.

For the above and additional details, including an updated,
interactive map of FMD distribution, visit

Viet Nam has been methodically submitting FMD samples to WERFMD
(Pirbright) for serotyping and genotyping since 2005. The most recent
FMDV serotype O isolates from Viet Nam, collected between 11 Nov 2010
and 29 Mar 2011 from cattle and buffaloes, have been genotyped as
topotype ME-SA, genotype/strain PanAsia. Notably, the most closely
related reference virus in WRL's arsenal was found to be the 2001
isolate from porcine in the UK (O/UKG/35/2001), its identity
percentage given as 93.58. For more details, including a dendogram,
please see

Earlier Viet Nam's serotype O isolates (2006), were both Cathay and
ME-SA/strain Mya-98. These and additional data on Vietnamese FMD virus
history are available at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm.

Viet Nam has been developing its dairy cattle sector apace. As
reported by various sources, including the national radio broadcaster
Voice of Vietnam (VOV), one of the recent projects was planned to
develop 12 cow farms and 500 tons of milk per day at a processing
factory in Nghia Dan District and maintain thousands of dairy cows,
imported from New Zealand. The importation of such susceptible animals
to FMD-stricken environment is a complex undertaking; it is of great
importance that the veterinary authorities are equipped with an
efficacious vaccine against the circulating FMD virus strain and that
the heifers are vaccinated prior to their potential exposure to the
virus. - Mod.AS]
