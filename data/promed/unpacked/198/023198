Winter wheat stages across the United States range from full maturity to flowering, but one consistent theme this spring [2016] is stripe rust. The yellow-orange pustules have swept through fields from Oklahoma and Kansas up into the Dakotas and east into the Great Lake states.

"The weather conditions were just right for stripe rust this year [2016]," noted Oklahoma State University's Bob Hunger. "It started early in southern Texas, and the winds blew it north, where it was favored by the cool, wet conditions that we had through spring." The disease is hitting in the maturing wheat crop of Nebraska, the Dakotas, the Great Lake states, and Ohio. "This is the most widespread and the earliest I have seen this disease in the state in 13 years," Ohio State University's Pierce Paul reported from Oklahoma.

[A farmer] in Nebraska [said that] every field has some disease. "I have not seen any variety that has not been infected. The rust keeps changing races so some (varieties) that were okay before may not be now." Growers with susceptible varieties who opted not to apply fungicides are likely to see 30-40 per cent yield loss or more.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge", providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

While stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_) poses a huge potential threat to world wheat production, stripe rust is currently causing the most damage to wheat crops on a global scale. New strains of both rusts with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat-growing areas worldwide. Projects for double resistance breeding to manage both stripe and stem rusts simultaneously are in progress (see ProMED-mail post 20120831.1274190).

Serious problems with stripe rust are currently also being reported from the UK (see link below) where a new strain is emerging (ProMED-mail post 20160219.4033809).
