Influenza update number 337 (based on data up to 3 Mar 2019)
----------------------------------------
Summary
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to be reported.
- In North America, influenza activity continued, but in recent weeks influenza A(H3N2) was the dominant virus, followed by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.
- In Europe, influenza activity decreased across the continent, with two-thirds of countries still above baseline for influenza-like illness activity. Influenza A viruses co-circulated.
- In North Africa, influenza activity was still reported in some countries.
- In Western Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, with the exception of some countries where activity remained elevated.
- In East Asia, influenza activity appeared to decrease overall, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity remained elevated overall with influenza A viruses predominating.
- In the Caribbean, Central American countries, and the tropical countries of South America, influenza and RSV activity were low in general.
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels, with the exception of some parts of Australia where influenza activity remained above inter-seasonal levels.

Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 114 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 18 Feb 2019 to 3 Mar 2019 (data as of 15 Mar 2019 07:02:52 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 205 150 specimens during that period. A total of 59 350 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 57 635 (97.1%) were typed as influenza A and 1715 (2.9%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 14 751 (59.5%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 10 037 (40.5%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 147 (19%) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 625 (81%) to the B-Victoria lineage.

The WHO Consultation and Information Meeting on the Composition of Influenza Virus Vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 Northern Hemisphere Influenza Season was held on 18-21 Feb 2019 in Beijing, China. It was recommended that egg-based quadrivalent vaccines contain the following: an A/Brisbane/02/2018 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus; an A(H3N2) virus to be announced on 21 Mar 2019*; a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage); and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage). It was also recommended that the influenza B virus component of trivalent vaccines for use in the 2019-2020 northern hemisphere influenza season be a B/Colorado/06/2017-like virus of the B/Victoria/2/87 lineage.

*In light of recent changes in the proportions of genetically and antigenically diverse A(H3N2) viruses, the recommendation for the A(H3N2) component has been postponed.

Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

[2] USA seasonal update
Date: Fri 29 Mar 2019

The flu season in the USA has now reached 18 straight weeks above baseline levels but shows signs of easing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said today [29 Mar 2019] in its weekly FluView update.

Partly because of increased activity of the H3N2 strain, however, the CDC issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory yesterday [28 Mar 2019] to clinicians about the prolonged season and the need for antiviral drugs for some patients. The past 5 seasons have averaged 16 weeks, with the longest being 20 weeks.

The agency noted that, although H3N2 cases have climbed in recent weeks, the 2009 H1N1 strain is still circulating, and low levels of influenza B have been detected, as well. "Because influenza A(H3N2) viruses may be associated with severe disease in older adults, this health advisory serves as a reminder that early empiric treatment with influenza antiviral medications is recommended for hospitalized and high-risk patients, especially those 65 years and older," the CDC said in the HAN notice. "Antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible after illness onset and should not wait for laboratory confirmation."

The CDC said it recommends antiviral drugs for all hospitalized, severely ill, and high-risk patients with suspected or confirmed influenza. It recommends them for treating the flu regardless of the patient's vaccination status because of their proven efficacy in reducing illness and severe outcomes.

The agency said in a summary of the FluView report, "While CDC continues to recommend influenza vaccination as long as influenza viruses are circulating, influenza antiviral drugs are an important 2nd line of defense that can be used to treat flu illness." The CDC said in the HAN advisory that the season "is likely to last several more weeks."

In the FluView report, the CDC noted that the percentage of clinic visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) has taken a healthy downturn. At 3.8% for the week ending 23 Mar [2019], it is still well above the national baseline of 2.2% but dropped from 4.4% the week before. All 10 US regions reported ILI at or above their region-specific baselines.

Twenty states experienced high ILI activity for the week, which is down from 26 the week before. Flu is geographically widespread in Puerto Rico and 34 states, compared with 44 states the week before.

H3N2 has now become more than twice as common as H1N1 among specimens tested at public health labs. Among 841 influenza A viruses subtyped, 68.1% were H3N2 and 31.9% were H1N1. The week before, H3N2 accounted for 65.4% and H1N1 34.6%. Only 5% of samples that tested positive for influenza were influenza B strains.

The CDC confirmed one new flu-related death in a child, bringing the number of pediatric flu deaths to 77 for the season. For comparison, the 3 previous flu seasons saw 95, 110, and 185 pediatric flu deaths over the entire season, respectively, according to CDC data.

As typically happens late in the season, the overall hospitalization rate for flu continued to climb. It rose to 52.5 per 100 000 population, up from 47.1 per 100 000 the week before.

The rate in seniors was 167.0 per 100 000 population, up from 146.0 per 100 000 the week before. People aged 50 to 64 years were the next hardest-hit group (67.4 per 100 000 population), then children 4 years old and younger (63.6 per 100 000).

The overall rate of deaths from pneumonia and flu was 7.4%, up from 7.1% and back up above the epidemic threshold of 7.2% for the week, the 6th week this season it has been above the threshold.

[3] Antiviral resistance surveillance in Japan (as of 25 Mar 2019)

To monitor antiviral-resistant influenza viruses, we tested A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B viruses by a combination of phenotypic and genotypic assays. In the phenotypic assay, approximately 10% to 20% of total isolates were randomly selected and subjected to a neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay for NA inhibitors, oseltamivir, peramivir, zanamivir, and laninamivir, or a focus reduction assay for baloxavir marboxil. In the genotypic assay, allele-specific TaqMan RT-PCR and/or sequencing of NA, PA, and M2 genes were performed to detect antiviral resistance mutations.

The data summarized below are results of phenotypic and genotypic assays reported.

2018/2019 influenza season (September 2018 to August 2019)
A(H1N1)pdm9: baloxavir resistant, 3 (2.3%); numbers of viruses tested, 133

[Rapid increase in seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 virus resistance to the new antiviral drug baloxavir is a matter of concern, and merits close consideration while making therapeutic decisions and monitoring patient response to treatment. - Mod.UBA
