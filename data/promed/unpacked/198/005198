Hendra human risk alert 'failure'
---------------------------------
Health authorities failed for 9 months to pass on warnings that humans
could contract Hendra virus [infection] from horses with no symptoms.
In a damning assessment of the state government's handling of the
bat-borne disease, which has killed 4 of 7 people infected since 1994,
Queensland Ombudsman Phil Clarke found the Department of Primary
Industries and Fisheries acted unreasonably when it failed to warn the
public of the risk, The Australian reports.

The report into the government's handling of 6 clusters of the disease
between 2006 and 2009, when 2 veterinarians died -- ahead of this
year's 18 outbreaks across Queensland and New South Wales -- found
systemic failures in the response.

Premier Anna Bligh said there had been a "significant shift" in the
government's handling of outbreaks since the study period, but echoed
the Ombudsman's call for more to be done before the next Hendra
outbreak.

The report says Queensland Health advised Primary Industries of the
risk of Hendra virus infection from horses without symptoms on 28 Jul
2008. Updated guidelines were issued to veterinarians in August and
November 2008, but did not mention the risk until April 2009. "In
hindsight, (the department) acknowledges that as a precaution, the
information should have been made more widely available with the
necessary caveats," the department said in response to the report.

Mr Clarke said the lack of compensation for owners of Hendra-positive
horses was "unreasonable." Ex gratia payments totalling AUD 220 000
[USD 228 316] were made through a trust to 2 veterinary clinics
without adequate records or a thorough assessment of how and why the
funds were sought, he said. Confidentiality clauses were "designed to
reduce the risk" of setting a precedent for compensation.

Among 74 recommendations, the Ombudsman calls for a review of the
department's policy of euthanizing Hendra-positive horses,
consideration of a framework for discretionary payments and a review
of communication practices. The government has until mid-December
[2011] to respond.

Agriculture Minister Tim Mulherin said the government had successfully
responded to this year's 10 outbreaks. "Biosecurity Queensland
http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/4790.htm has successfully managed all of
these cases without any spread of infection from the primary
location," he said. New legislation addressing many issues raised in
the report was introduced into parliament late last month [October
2011].

Queensland Horse Council president Debbie Dekker said the government
"really started taking it seriously in the last few years" and it was
unfortunate the report focused on earlier events. "There certainly
were shortcomings in the way the government handled the Hendra virus
[outbreaks]," she said. "I think they'd got a little bit slack because
nothing much had happened for 3 years, and the human infection part of
it had sort of been dismissed."

Liberal National Party agriculture spokesman Andrew Cripps called on
Mr Mulherin to detail the government response to the recommendations.

[Hendra virus was 1st recognized in 1994 during an outbreak of acute
respiratory disease among 21 horses in Australia. 2 people were
infected, and one died. Since then, there have been another 10
outbreaks, all in Australia, and 3 involving human cases. Initially
named Equine Morbilivirus, Hendra virus is a member of the genus
_Henipavirus_, a new class of virus in the family _Paramyxoviridae_.

Hendra virus is a rare, emerging zoonotic virus that can cause
respiratory and neurological disease and death in people. It can also
cause severe disease and death in horses, resulting in considerable
economic losses for horse breeders. Hendra virus is transmitted to
people through close contact with infected horses or their body
fluids. To date, no human-to-human transmission of Hendra virus has
been documented.

Fruit bats of the family _Pteropodidae_ -- particularly the species
belonging to the genus _Pteropus_ -- are the natural hosts for Hendra
virus. There is no apparent disease in fruit bats. It is assumed that
the geographic distribution of Henipaviruses overlap with that of
genus _Pteropus_. This hypothesis was reinforced with the evidence of
Henipavirus infection in Pteropus bats from Australia, Bangladesh,
Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Papua New
Guinea, Thailand and Timor-Leste. Recently, African fruit bats of the
genus _Eidolon_, family _Pteropodidae_, were found positive for
antibodies against Nipah and Hendra viruses indicating that these
viruses might be present within the geographic distribution of
_Pteropodidae_ bats in Africa.

Although Hendra virus has caused only a few outbreaks, its potential
for further spread and ability to cause disease and death in people
have made it a public health concern. The concern has heightened in
the most recent outbreaks, as the horses' symptoms have shifted to
become largely neurological instead of respiratory. This suggests the
possibility of genetic diversity in the strain, and potentially a more
infective virus.

Human infections with Hendra virus range from mild influenza-like
illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. Infected people
initially develop fever, headaches, myalgia (muscle pain), sore throat
and a dry cough. They could also have enlarged lymph nodes, lethargy
and vertigo. The incubation period (interval from infection to onset
of symptoms) ranges from 5 to 14 days. To date, there have been 6
confirmed human cases including 3 deaths.

One of the people who died developed pneumonitis, respiratory failure,
renal failure, and arterial thrombosis. The patient died of cardiac
arrest. Another person demonstrated an unusual, progressive fatal
neurological illness. He initially had a mild type of inflammation of
the brain (meningoencephalitis) with a sore throat, headache,
drowsiness, vomiting and neck stiffness. After treatment with
antibiotics, he made a full recovery, but 13 months later he developed
signs of encephalitis that progressed to coma and death. The 3
infected people who made a full recovery have had no residual problems
or relapse.

In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in
people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating
people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the
virus.

Public health educational messages should focus on the following: (1)
Reducing the risk of horse-to-human transmission. Protective equipment
such as gloves, gowns, masks and protective eyewear should be worn
while handling sick animals or their tissues, and during post-mortems;
(2) Reducing the risk of bat-to-horse transmission. Horse feed and
water troughs should be relocated to areas away from where bats feed
or roost; and, (3) Controlling infection in health-care settings.
