Measles virus genotyping an important tool in measles outbreak investigation in Norway, 2011. (By Vainio K, Steen TW, Arnesen TM, Ronning K, Anestad G, Dudman S.)

Summary
--------
This study describes 33 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles that occurred in Norway in 2011, mainly among unvaccinated children between 7 months and 10 years of age. Laboratory testing included detection of anti-measles IgM and IgG antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and molecular detection and characterisation of measles virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Epidemiological data and genotyping revealed that the measles cases originated from 8 separate importations, resulting in 4 outbreaks and 4 sporadic cases. Except for the 1st outbreak which affected 18 cases, limited secondary spread occurred in each of the 3 other outbreaks. The outbreaks were caused by measles virus genotypes B3, D4 and D9, whereas genotypes D8 and B3 were detected in the sporadic cases. This study highlights that genetic characterisation of measles virus is an essential tool in the laboratory surveillance of measles, especially in countries like Norway which are approaching the measles elimination goal. The investigation revealed that importation of measles resulted in subsequent transmission within Norway to non-vaccinated individuals, and 12 cases occurred in healthcare settings, involving both staff and children. The 4 cases detected among healthcare workers (HCWs) emphasised that the coverage of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination among healthcare personnel needs to be improved, and both primary and secondary vaccine failure was demonstrated in 2 fully immunised HCWs.

Introduction
----------
Measles, a highly contagious respiratory viral disease characterised by the appearance of fever and a rash, is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality worldwide [1]. The incubation time is between 10 and 14 days, and a measles infected person is contagious from 4 days before to 4 days after the rash appears. Although a safe and cost-effective vaccine has been available for decades, measles is still an ongoing public health problem in several European countries. Between January and October 2011, 26 074 measles cases were reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) European region [2]. The target date for elimination of measles in Europe has been changed a number of times, and due to widespread outbreaks occurring in both eastern and western Europe (Austria, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Romania, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (UK)) [3], the WHO Regional Office for Europe most recently (2010) changed the target date from 2010 to 2015 [3,4].

Measles elimination is defined as the interruption of indigenous transmission of measles virus for a 12-month period [5]. In order to prevent outbreaks, a measles vaccine coverage of 95 percent for 2 doses of vaccine is needed [6]. In addition, strong national surveillance systems are necessary to detect all clinical cases of measles and to investigate thoroughly all single cases and outbreaks. In Europe, personal attitudes toward vaccination are factors that influence the vaccination coverage, which is variable [3].

Laboratory diagnosis is required for confirmation of measles, especially in times of low incidence, when most cases of fever illness with rash are caused by other agents. The WHO currently recognises 8 clades of measles virus (A-H) with a total of 23 genotypes recognised within the clades, and viruses with related sequences within a genotype (e.g. B3) are referred to as clusters [7,8]. Molecular characterisation of measles virus isolates is vital in outbreak investigations and the only tool that demonstrates the interruption of circulating endemic virus [5,9]. Consequently, it is one of the key components of the verification of measles elimination.

In Norway, measles is a mandatory notifiable disease. Between 1975 and 1988, only measles encephalitis cases were notified, but since 1988, all cases of measles are notifiable. All children residing in Norway are offered the measles vaccine free of charge as part of the childhood vaccination programme. One dose of a monovalent measles vaccine was introduced in the national vaccination programme in Norway in 1969. This was replaced by the combined measles-mumps-rubella MMR vaccine in 1983, applied in a 2-dose schedule (at 15 months and at 11-12 years of age). Due to a high coverage (over 90 percent) of 2 doses of the MMR vaccine in the last decades, according to the National vaccine register (SYSVAK) [10], measles incidence has declined in Norway since the 1st half of the 1980s [11,12]. In 2011, the vaccination coverage in 2 year olds (birth cohort 2009) with the 1st dose was 93 percent in the whole of Norway, 92 percent in Oslo, and 88 percent in the district of Old Oslo in Oslo [10]. The MMR vaccine coverage data for the 2nd dose is available for 16 year olds (birth cohort 1993), and the coverage was 90 percent in the district of Old Oslo and 94 percent in Oslo as well as in rest of the country [10]. All measles cases identified during the last decade in Norway have been linked to importation from endemic areas or linked to other outbreaks in Europe [12,13]. The last outbreak in Norway before 2011 occurred in 2008 in an anthroposophical community, where the index case fell ill after returning from Austria [14]. In 2007, there was an outbreak among members of the Irish travelling community from England who were in Norway at the time [13]. Measles spread among unvaccinated children within the community, but no cases occurred in the local population.

Results
------
Clinical, epidemiological and genotyping results revealed that 29 of the cases belonged to 4 different outbreaks, whereas the remaining 4 cases were separate importations. The outbreaks were caused by 2 distinct variants of genotype B3, genotype D4 and D9, whereas genotype B3 (2 variants) and D8 were detected in the 4 sporadic cases.

[Interested readers should access the original text via the source URL to obtain detailed accounts of the 4 outbreaks. Outbreak 1 involved measles introduction with secondary spread, and outbreaks 2, 3 and 4 involved measles introduction with limited spread. The figures include a phylogenetic tree showing clusters of measles virus sequences derived from clinical samples of each measles case in Norway in 2011 (n=33), which is an important outcome of this research.]

Discussion
---------
This study describes the introduction of at least 8 different measles viruses into Norway during the year 2011. We investigated a total of 33 measles cases, which could be grouped into 4 outbreaks and 4 sporadic cases. The measles virus genotypes detected during 2011 were D4, D9, D8 and 4 different sequence variants of genotype B3. This is the largest number of measles cases reported within a single year since the large outbreak at Nesodden near Oslo in an anthroposophic community in 1997. Since then, only imported cases have been identified in Norway. The situation seen in Norway in 2011 may thus reflect the increased number of measles cases and multistate outbreaks of measles that have been observed in European countries.

The largest outbreak in Norway started in January 2011 with importation from Ethiopia, and 18 people were infected during the following 9 weeks. Genotyping showed that the outbreak was sustained by an identical B3 variant. Genotype B3 was the most frequently reported genotype from Africa to the WHO Global Sequence database during the period from 2007 to 2009, and was also found circulating in Malawi, Liberia and Mauritania in 2010. Genotype B3 has been associated with outbreaks in Kenya in 2005, and a nearly identical B3 variant was detected in outbreak 1. Genotype B3 is currently regarded as an endemic genotype in most of the African continent, including Kenya and Ethiopia and has been associated with importations from African countries to other parts of the world. The index case in outbreak 1 was a family member living in Ethiopia, and the B3 variant detected in this outbreak differed by only one nt from a B3 variant causing outbreaks in Kenya in 2005.

Additionally, 3 other genotype B3 variants were imported to Norway from Kenya during 2011; however, only one of the variants resulted in a small outbreak 3. These different B3 variants were either identical or 1-3 nt different from the B3 variants (MVs/Minnesota.USA/12.11 and MVs/Minnesota.USA/10.11/2) that caused outbreaks in the Somali community in Minnesota in 2011. Epidemiological data did not identify a link between all cases infected with the slightly different B3 variants, indicating that the strains were independent importations and showing how easily measles virus spreads between countries among susceptible individuals. However, one must bear in mind that only minor sequence differences were obtained.

Population immunity in Norway is generally sufficiently high to prevent sustained transmission of measles virus and was probably the reason why further transmission of some of the imported strains did not develop. In addition, there was a lot of awareness among HCWs [health care workers] and the public due to the ongoing outbreaks, especially the 1st 3, and local health authorities organised vaccination campaigns and provided information to the affected community. In spite of this, this study nevertheless shows that even in a country with a generally high MMR coverage, measles virus can affect a group with low vaccine coverage and cause an outbreak affecting unvaccinated individuals both in and outside the group. The measles outbreaks gave an opportunity to investigate the reasons why parents choose not to vaccinate their children and, at the same time, to disperse misunderstanding concerning MMR vaccination. Reasons for non-vaccination were mainly fear of side effects of the vaccine.

The results highlight the importance of genotyping in order to trace the source of infections, to distinguish sporadic cases from outbreak cases, and to verify the end of an outbreak. For example, measles cases with the outbreak 1 genotype were not detected after week 12, suggesting the end of this outbreak, while 2 measles cases subsequently occurring in week 16 were shown to be part of a new different outbreak (outbreak 3) involving a different genotype from that of outbreak 1.

The outbreaks also demonstrated that the measles virus was easily transmitted to unvaccinated individuals in healthcare facilities and emergency centres, which are separate centres located outside the hospitals. As seen in other studies, the outbreaks affected mainly unvaccinated children under 2 years of age. Many of the affected children were under the age when the 1st MMR dose normally is given (15 month). This raised the question as to whether the age for administration of the 1st dose should be brought down to 12 months; however, as 8 of the cases were under 12 months of age, these would not have been avoided by lowering the age.

Measles infection was also demonstrated in 4 HCWs, 2 fully immunised, one unvaccinated, and one with no information on vaccination status. Genotyping revealed an identical B3 variant in 2 of the HCWs (case 17 and case 20), and demonstrated that these 2 also became a source of transmission. The 2 fully immunised HCWs had, according to the national vaccination programme, received 2 doses of MMR vaccines during childhood and were, therefore, classified as primary and secondary vaccine failure (PVF and SVF). Diagnosis of SVF may be challenging; however, anti-measles IgM in oral fluid and high-avidity anti-measles IgG in serum samples were documented in the case with SVF (case 19). An assay for detection of measles plaque reduction neutralisation antibodies was not available. SVF cases with mild clinical courses similar to the case reported in this study have been observed in several studies. Such cases are regarded as less contagious than unvaccinated measles cases, as measles virus in these circumstances can be difficult to detect, and transmission is limited. Waning of the measles antibody has been observed in cohorts of vaccinees 10 years after the 2nd dose, and, in the case of extended duration of measles virus exposure, previously immune individuals can develop infection.

The genotype D4 detected in this study differed only by one nt from the genotype D4 detected in Irish travellers in UK and Norway in 2007, indicating that a nearly identical D4 variant is still circulating in Europe. Genotype D4 has been associated with large numbers of cases and outbreaks in Europe in the last years and was detected in 24 countries in Europe during 2011. The index case in outbreak 2 fell ill 12 days after arrival in Oslo and was probably infected in Spain or during transit; however, endemic circulation of closely related D4 variants makes it difficult to trace the transmission pathways.

The genotype D9 causing outbreak 4 was imported by the index case, who had visited Southeast Asia. Genotyping revealed identical sequences in 2 additional measles cases, although an epidemiological link was only confirmed between the index case and a schoolmate. However, all 3 cases lived in the same area of Oslo. Measles has a high basic reproduction number (R0: 12-18), and transmission is possible by infectious measles virus-containing respiratory droplets for up to 2 hours after the infectious individual has departed an area. Genotype D9 has been associated with endemic transmission in several countries in Asia.

This study demonstrates the importance of obtaining an adequate sample for virological surveillance. Oral fluid is the preferred sample type for PCR examination and genotyping, and the chance of detecting measles virus is highest in the 1st week of the disease. Acute phase oral fluid was obtained from the majority of cases, and PCR was able to detect measles virus in oral fluid taken between day one and day 8 from the onset of symptoms. In addition, as most of the cases in this study were small children, oral fluid is also easier to obtain. Although some cases with milder symptoms could have been missed, we do not believe that there were many missed opportunities in identifying the exposed individuals, as samples are taken from patients showing any symptoms of measles. Nevertheless, there might have been a few missed cases, especially ones with mild symptoms.

In conclusion, this study has shown that molecular analyses of measles virus detected in Norway in 2011 provided important information in order to track the transmission path and the origin of the infection, to distinguish sporadic cases from outbreak cases, and to confirm vaccine failure. Especially in countries nearing the measles elimination goal, molecular analysis is essential in verification of elimination and to monitor the impact of importations, which can cause limited outbreaks. For preventing such outbreaks, organising information and vaccination campaigns in the affected communities is important. In Norway, hospitalised children with rash illness are isolated, but this measure is not in place for outpatient settings. Recommendations concerning the handling of suspected measles cases in outpatient settings are warranted in order to avoid the spread of measles within healthcare centres. The 4 cases among the HCWs emphasised that the coverage of MMR vaccination among healthcare personnel needs to be improved as, due to their type of work, HCWs can be particularly exposed to measles and, if infected, can potentially transmit the disease to patients. More studies are also needed to investigate the cause of the SVF [secondary vaccine failure].

Nearly 30 children have contracted measles in the Carlisle and Eden areas so far this year [2012]. The Health Protection Agency has released figures for Cumbria and Lancashire in a desperate plea for parents to ensure their children are immunised. There are 91 confirmed cases across the 2 counties so far this year, compared with just 6 in 2011. Of those, 18 are in the Carlisle district, and 10 are in Eden.

Health experts are particularly concerned, as an outbreak in Merseyside has already affected more than 500 people. Dr Ken Lamden, a consultant with the HPA's Cumbria and Lancashire health protection unit, said: "There's a lot of measles around at present. It's a highly infectious disease that can have serious consequences for some people, and anyone who isn't fully vaccinated is liable to be vulnerable to it." He continued: "There's an on-going outbreak of measles on Merseyside, where more than 500 cases have been confirmed by laboratory testing. 1/3rd of these patients were ill enough to require inpatient treatment in hospital, and a number were seriously ill, a reminder that measles should not be taken lightly."

Two doses of MMR vaccine give full protection against measles, mumps and rubella (German measles). The 1st dose is given to toddlers at the age of 13 months and the 2nd at the age of 4, before the child goes to school. However, the agency is keen to stress that it is never too late for older children, teenagers, and young adults to be vaccinated if they missed out as toddlers.

Dr Rebecca Wagstaff, deputy director of public health at NHS Cumbria, said: "Measles is highly infectious, and anyone who has not previously been vaccinated is at risk when it gets into a community, as it has done here. While vaccination rates amongst children in Cumbria are currently amongst the highest in the country, there are still a number of teenagers who failed to get protected when they were younger." She added: "It is not too late, and no one anywhere in Cumbria should take the risk of catching measles when a safe and effective vaccine is available."

Parents are being reminded of the importance of having their children immunised against measles after a rise in the number of cases in Middlewich. The best prevention is the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The 1st dose is given at 13 months and at 3 years, 4 months for the 2nd dose. Some of the signs and symptoms of the disease are: cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, red eyes and sensitivity to light, aches and pains, dry cough, and red-brown spotty rash. If your child is unwell with these symptoms, they should not be in nursery, playgroup or school. If you are thinking of taking your child to the GP, you are asked to ring beforehand; this is because measles is very infectious, and your doctor may want to make special arrangements for your children to be seen. Clr Janet Clowes, Cheshire East cabinet member for health and adult social care, said: "Measles can be a particularly unpleasant illness and one that can be easily avoided by having the MMR vaccine. Thankfully, there has only been a small number of cases recently, but this is a timely reminder for parents of the need to keep up to date with their child's immunisations."

More than 120 cases of measles have been confirmed by doctors across St Helens and Knowsley already this year [2012]. Concerned health chiefs are urging parents to vaccinate their children following a large outbreak of the disease across the region. There have been 33 laboratory confirmed cases in St Helens and Halton since the outbreak began at the start of February 2012 and 90 in neighbouring Knowsley. Dr Anjila Shah, a consultant with the region's Health Protection Unit, said: "Measles is clearly circulating in the community. It's a highly infectious disease, and the only protection against it is the MMR vaccine. The 1st dose of MMR should be given at 13 months and the 2nd at approximately 40 months before the child goes to school. However, older children, teenagers and young adults who missed out as toddlers can still be vaccinated," Dr Shah added.

The Health Protection Agency is advising people with symptoms of measles to stay away from school, nursery or work until 5 days have elapsed since the onset of the rash. You should telephone your GP or NHS walk-in centre before attending so that arrangements can be made for you to be treated in isolation from other patients and to avoid contact with people, particularly babies, pregnant women, and anyone who is known to have poor immunity. Measles is an infectious viral illness spread through coughing and sneezing.

An outbreak of measles has been reported in Belfast after 4 cases were detected in recent weeks. The Public Health Agency has warned that children who have been exposed to these cases -- all detected in the south of the city -- will need to be vaccinated as soon as possible against measles, mumps and rubella. Warning letters have been written to GPs, hospital and emergency department staff asking them to be vigilant for people presenting with the symptoms of measles. Parents of children who have not been fully vaccinated are being advised to organise for them to have the MMR injection as soon as possible.

Dr Richard Smithson, Consultant in Health Protection (PHA), said there is no room for complacency on the issue. "In Northern Ireland, we have had high uptake levels for MMR immunisation, which is why we have generally seen very few cases of measles here compared with the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland," said Dr Smithson. "However, cases which have occurred here in unvaccinated people are of serious concern and remind us that there is no room for complacency. For those children and young people who have not been vaccinated, it is essential that they get vaccinated as soon as possible."

Some of the warning signs to look out for if someone is infected with measles are cold-like symptoms, a poor appetite, aches and pains, and a red-brown spotty rash. If a parent suspects their child of having the symptoms, they are advised to call a doctor for advice rather than bringing them straight to a hospital, where the infection could spread. A spokesman for the Public Health Agency said: "The PHA is reminding parents and individuals about the importance of protecting their children and themselves against this serious infectious disease, which can be life-threatening and can spread to those who are unprotected."

Further measles outbreaks are expected after an expert report found clusters of children were affected where the HSE had cut back on vaccinations. Pockets of the country hit hard by the disease matched areas where a school-based programme to deliver the MMR jab was discontinued. The revelation has emerged in an investigation into potentially life-threatening measles' outbreaks in Dublin last year [2011].

Dr Gabriel Fitzpatrick, a public health specialist in the Health Service Executive (HSE), led a team that found that a majority of the 285 cases of measles reported for the country last year [2012] were in Dublin. But the areas where children suffered most, and where clusters broke out, were in the north inner-city districts and suburbs. Many children here ended up hospitalised with the illness.

Measles is highly infectious, with potentially serious complications, including blindness and even death. Children need 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to protect them from measles at 12 months of age and again later when they are 4 or 5. Children ordinarily get this 2nd dose at school, when a public health team come to vaccinate children with the permission of their parents, ensuring that as many youngsters as possible are given the jab. But Dr Fitzpatrick and the study team found that in 2000, the HSE stopped giving the children in Ballymun and East Wall the school-based vaccine because of a funding crisis. It was left to the more unreliable system of mothers in these areas remembering to bring their child to a GP for the 2nd dose. This contrasts to parents in affluent areas where the school-based programme continued. The findings, published in the journal Eurosurveillance, showed that the axing of the school-based vaccination in East Wall and Ballymun was never reversed. Just 75 percent of children in these areas have the full course of MMR vaccine, when it should be as high as 95 percent to ensure protection.

Dr Fitzmaurice told the Irish Independent: "We showed that the vaccination policy currently being employed in Dublin facilitated the outbreak in the north inner-city during 2011. This policy has not changed, and as a result, future outbreaks can be expected in this area of the city." He pointed out that many of those who caught measles were babies under 12 months who were not eligible for the 1st dose of vaccine but who should be protected by "herd immunity" as a result of older children getting the jab with less infection circulating. Dr Fitzmaurice said of the 250 notified cases of measles in Dublin last year [2011], 145 of the children had received no MMR vaccination, and for 38, it was unclear whether they had any jab. The outbreak led to 24 children in the Dublin region being admitted to hospital with complications such as seizures, pneumonia, high temperature, dehydration due to nausea and vomiting, and tonsillitis. No child died from the effects of measles.

Nearly 100 children among over 1000 recorded cases of measles have died between October and November 2012 in the Health Area of Yawuma (Province Orientale). These figures were revealed on Mon 10 Dec 2012 by Dr. Cyprian Loseya, Chief Medical Officer of health for the district Tshopo-Lomami. 51 deaths were recorded in October 2012. According to local sources, the high number of measles cases in this Health Area are due to the poverty of the population, who lack money to bring sick children to health centers.

A team from Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) has been in Yawuma since Thu 6 Dec 2012 to help health officials in the fight against measles. The team brought drugs and intend to train local staff.

Health officials in Birnin Kebbi Local Government and Ambursa/Kardi Development Area in Kebbi State said they discovered 37 fresh cases of measles in rural communities. The discovery came 2 weeks after 7 children died of the disease.

The Director of Health in the area, Malam Yusuf Sani, said in Birnin Kebbi that the disease was discovered in Runtuwa, Gawasu in Ambursa/Kardi development area. He said treatment and isolation of the affected children as well as provision of drugs had begun.

Measles, which had so far claimed 7 lives since its outbreak, was uncovered 2 weeks ago, while 245 out of the 275 children had been treated. Sani said 38 new cases had been recorded in Runtuwa and Gawasu as well as in sections of the metropolis.

"We have been getting assistance with drugs now from the federal and state governments and NGOs," he said, and called on parents to monitor their children's movements, as the disease is airborne.

Fearing an outbreak of measles in Larkana division following reports of several deaths in Naudero town and some villages, the district health authorities have requested the Expanded Programme of Immunisation (EPI), Sindh to provide adequate funds for launching a vaccination drive against the disease.

There were reports that at least 6 children -- 4 of them in Naudero town alone, one in Burirro village, and another in Naich village -- died of measles within a fortnight. Only on Tuesday [11 Dec 2012], an 8-year-old boy died of measles, said his relative, a resident of Gharibabad. This was the 3rd death in his family, he added. While Larkana district health officer (DHO) Dr Abdul Fatah Bughio said he could not verify the reported deaths, cases of measles were constantly being reported from upper Sindh.

"We have sent blood samples of 400 suspected measles cases to the National Institute of Health, Islamabad. Of them, 125 cases tested positive for measles, and this is enough to gauge the gravity of the situation," the DHO said. He confirmed to Dawn [newspaper] that a request for provision of adequate funds to launch an anti-measles drive had been sent to the EPI after a discussion on the issue. Addressed to the Sindh EPI project director, the communique stressed the need for launching a campaign in the division before the disease took the shape of an outbreak, he said, adding that the letter also suggested to the EPI that the required funds could be arranged through the World Health Organisation. He said a lack of sanitation and poverty topped the causes of measles spread. A round of immunisation against the disease along with a sanitation drive was recently conducted in Bakrani and Dokri areas after many cases were reported from these areas, he added. He did not come up with a satisfactory reply when asked why more measles cases were being reported even after the routine immunisation and other preventive measures. He, however, linked the situation with unhygienic conditions and poverty in the affected areas.

Dr Ashique Jokhio, the head of the immunisation surveillance, Larkana, said that he had information about 550 cases of measles and that samples of suspected cases were regularly being dispatched to the NIH. A professor of paediatrics at the Chandka Medical College Hospital, Dr Shanti Lal, said that he had examined 50 cases of measles at his clinic over the past 4 to 5 weeks.

Prof Dr Saifullah Jamro, chairman of the department of medicine and allied sciences at the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Medical University (SBBMU), Larkana, told Dawn that poor immunisation practices in the country coupled with under-reporting of cases were major factors in aggravating the situation. He said measles was believed to be one of the leading causes of mortality in young children. He said that 139 300 deaths from measles were reported in 2010 globally; that came to nearly 380 deaths every day or 15 deaths an hour. He observed that more than 95 per cent of measles-related deaths were reported from countries with weak health infrastructure.

Vaccination against measles had reduced the death rate by 74 per cent between 2000 and 2010 worldwide, Prof Jamro said, adding that by the end of 2012, some 21 000 children in the country were vulnerable to measles. As many as 2143 cases had already been confirmed across the country, he said, while terming the situation alarming. He said Sindh topped all the provinces with 737 cases having been reported this year [2012] so far. It was followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 648 cases and Punjab with 582 cases, he added.

Prof Jamro said that from 1 Jan to 6 Oct 2012, a total of 236 outbreaks were reported in the country. Giving a breakdown, he said 51 were reported from Qambar-Shahdadkot district, 24 from Dadu district, and 23 from Khairpur district. A total of 3833 cases were reported from these districts. Of them, 543 cases were reported from Qambar-Shahdadkot followed by Larkana with 371 cases and Dadu with 320 cases, he said. During this period, 67 deaths from measles were reported, he said, adding that 14 of them were reported from Karachi, 13 from Qambar-Shahdadkot, and 7 from Sukkur.

"Devastating rains and floods have aggravated the situation in the districts, and a nationwide measles elimination campaign needs to be launched on an urgent basis," he said.
