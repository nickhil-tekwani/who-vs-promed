Workers on a gas production platform in the Bass Strait want their barge returned to port after a major outbreak of salmonella and gastroenteritis. One construction worker on the Origin Energy project has been flown to hospital in Melbourne. In total, 36 of more than 200 workers have fallen ill in the 2 weeks since the outbreak, their union said.

"We are recommending a full vessel decontamination, but these calls are being pushed aside," Australian Workers Union Victorian state secretary Cesar Melham said. Crew say their calls to evacuate are being ignored in order to keep the 345 million dollar platform expansion project on-track.

An Origin Energy and Downer Engineering spokesman said they had been working with Tasmania's Department of Health and best-practice guidelines had been followed. "We have been working with . . . on-site health professionals to institute preventative measures including quarantine and to continue infection control measures," the spokesman said.

Mr Melham said the outbreak was believed to have stemmed from improperly prepared meat. However, workers continued to fall ill following a clean-up and other control measures that took place 4 days ago.

[The Bass Strait is the body of water separating Tasmania from the south of the Australian mainland, specifically the state of Victoria. It can be seen on the maps at

If the outbreak has been ongoing for 2 weeks, a continuing source of food/water contamination should exist since the incubation period of salmonellosis is only several days and, unlike shigellosis and _E. coli_ O157 infection, person-to-person transmission of salmonellosis is not the rule. The serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ is not given in the report. - Mod.LL]
