A 12-year-old boy has been found suffering from scrub typhus at PHC [Primary Health Center] Thanga, said a statement of Dr. L. Gojendra Singh, CMO [Chief Medical Officer] Bishnupur.

The boy was found suffering from the disease on 8 Sep [2020] and was referred to JNIMS [Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences], on family's request. His condition is improving, said the CMO, stating that scrub typhus is endemic in the district and there have been casualties every year due to the disease. Most of the casualties happened due to lack of medical attention.

Anyone feeling unwell should report to the nearest PHC/CHC [Community Health Center], said the CMO. Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is a disease caused by a bacterium called _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. Scrub typhus is spread to people through bites of infected chiggers (larval mites). The most common symptoms of scrub typhus include fever, headache, body aches, and sometimes rash.

[Thanga is an island village in Loktak Lake, with a population of 13 085 residents in 2001, located in the Bishnupur district in the Indian state of Manipur; the main occupation of this village is fishing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanga). A map showing the location of Thanga can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanga,+Manipur,+India. Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences, a state-funded medical college and hospital, is located in the city of Imphal, the capital of the Indian state of Manipur (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences). Imphal is about 66 km (41 mi) from Thanga.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated.

ProMED has posted multiple reports of scrub typhus in several Indian states in the past, especially since 2011. For background information, see ProMED post Scrub typhus - India (05): background 20111208.3546. - Mod.ML
