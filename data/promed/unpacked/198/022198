Outbreak of Yellow Fever in Ghana Not Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail has learned from the same reliable source that the outbreak
suspected to be due to yellow fever, which began in February 2001 on the
border of Ghana and Burkino Faso, with 9 suspected cases including 6 deaths,
is not yellow fever. The laboratory tests were negative.
ProMED-mail would be interested to learn the final diagnosis.
