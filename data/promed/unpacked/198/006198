Police said on Tue 3 Dec 2002 that 10 members of a family, including 6
children, the youngest only 3 years old, died of suspected food poisoning
after a family feast in a remote Indian village. Two neighbors also died
after eating what police believe was rotten chicken on Mon 2 Dec 2002 in
Bundi district, about 125 miles from Jaipur, capital of the desert state of
Rajasthan, a police officer said.
Chicken is a rare treat among the impoverished Mogiya tribespeople in the
farming district. There are 2 people, including a child, in critical
condition in hospital. Police said autopsies would be done [on the
deceased], but initial indications were that all died of food poisoning.
Newspapers quoted village officials as saying the victims complained of
dizziness and started vomiting soon after eating the chicken.

[The exact source of the offending preformed toxin or poison is not clear
in this case, but what appears to be a short incubation period suggests
that this was not an infection per se. Even staphylococcal or _Bacillus
cereus_ food poisoning can be fatal if enough toxin is ingested. The
posting does not offer any information on symptoms other than dizziness and
vomiting. The postmortem examinations may not produce a diagnosis, but we
would be pleased to hear more from any subscribers with information about
this incident. - Mod.LL]
