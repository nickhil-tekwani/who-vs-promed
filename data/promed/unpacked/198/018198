Unusual pneumonia outbreak kills camels on Dubai farms
------------------------------------------------------
Scientists are investigating an unusual outbreak of pneumonia in camels. So
far, 15 cases -- all of them fatal -- have been recorded since March 2008.
The [bacterium] causing the disease, _Rhodococcus equi_, is common in foals
and can sometimes infect people. But this is the 1st time it has been
discovered in camels.

"It is a new disease for us," said Dr Ulrich Wernery, scientific director
of the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (CVRL). "It came out of the
blue."

Between March 2008 and July the following year [2009], the laboratory
received 4 dead camels from a large farm in Dubai. More animals arrived
from a 2nd farm, raising the total number of animals to 15. "The camels
came to CVRL for necropsy and we saw that they had severe pneumonia," he said.

Tests in Germany isolated the bacteria from the dead animals' lung tissue.
Later, the bacteria were also found in liver and spleen tissue samples. A
scientific paper describing the findings, including an account of the
disease found in a llama in the US, has been published in the most recent
issue of the international journal Veterinary Microbiology. "This is the
1st published account of this disease for old-world camels," said Dr Wernery.

A soil-living bacterium, _Rhodococcus equi_, is mainly present in damp
conditions. On farms, contamination often starts from areas where there is
dripping water from pipes or other sources of leakage.

In young horses, the disease is usually easily treated with antibiotics
because those animals exhibit heavy breathing, lethargy, coughing, and
fever early on. Camels, however, do not develop those symptoms until the
pneumonia has become very advanced, making it much more difficult to
identify. "Camels can endure so much pain, that you will not see it until
it is too late," Dr Wernery said. "Most of the time, an animal is sick for
2 days and then it just drops dead."

The scientists are now looking for clues as to what might have caused the
outbreak. "This is an emerging, new disease in camels," Dr Wernery said.
"We do not know if the pattern of disease in camels is the same as in horses."

This month [November 2010], his laboratory started collecting and testing
samples from the 2 affected farms. Feed and soil samples are being
collected, as well as samples from camel droppings on the 2 farms. The
latter are tested, as droppings are a common way of passing the infection
in horses. So far, scientists have tested 20 samples, all found to be
negative, with 100 more to go. "We have no idea, but I hope in 6 months we
would know the source ... Once we find the source, we can hopefully prevent
[further] spread," Dr Wernery said.

[The newswire above relates to the following paper:
J Kinne, H Madarame, S Takai, et al. Disseminated _Rhodococcus equi_
infection in dromedary camels (_Camelus dromedarius_). Vet Microbiol. 2010
Oct 8 [Epub ahead of print]. For subscribers' convenience, here is the
abstract:

"_Rhodococcus (R). equi_, a recognized pathogen in horses, is emerging as a
human opportunistic pathogen, especially in immunocompromised people. It
affects also New World camelids, but there are no reports of _R. equi_
infection in Old World camelids yet.

"Four cases of disseminated _R. equi_ infection in adult breeding
dromedaries occurred at one camel farm near Dubai within 16 months of each
other. At necropsy the lungs were diffusely consolidated with large caseous
areas. Histology revealed severe suppurative to necrotising pneumonia with
multiple encapsulated abscesses. Immunohistochemistry enabled the detection
of 15- to 17-kDa antigens (VapA) of _R. equi_ in the lung sections. High
numbers of _R. equi_ were isolated from the lung lesions as well as from
liver, spleen, and mediastinal lymph nodes, indicative of septicaemia. The
isolated strains were PCR-positive for the specific virulence plasmid
(VapA-Gen) of _R. equi_, indicating virulent strains and containing an
85-kb type I plasmid.

"This is the 1st report of disseminated _R. equi_ infection in Old World
camelids. Since adult camels in general do not suffer from bacterial caused
pneumonia (except tuberculosis), this is a new emerging disease for camels."

_Rhodococcus equi_ was 1st described in 1923 by Magnusson as
_Corynebacterium equi_, based on an isolate from the lung of a foal with
pyogranulomatous pneumonia. In 1977, it was reclassified as _R. equi_. It
is a zoonotic disease, mainly affecting immunocompromised humans, mostly
resulting in pneumonia with fever, cough, and chest pain, but can also
spread to other organs and cause bacteremia.

In addition to equines and humans, other mammals have also been reported as
sporadically infected: pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, llama, cats, and dogs.

In pigs, _R. equi_ can cause a chronic cervical lymphadenitis with
tuberculosis-like lesions, but also found in submaxillary lymph nodes and
tonsils of healthy animals.

_R. equi_ can cause tuberculosis-like lesions in lymph nodes of cattle and
in the livers of young goats (see reference below).

weather the information relates to dromedaries (single-humped) or Bactrian
(2-humped) camels.
