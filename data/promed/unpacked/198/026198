HANTAVIRUS PULMONARY SYNDROME: COMMENT

I was struck by the statement in the HPS [hantavirus pulmnonary syndrome
piece [ibid that 40% of people infected with a hantavirus die and I
suspect that is be the mortality for HPS patients, rather than all comers.
There is a little population seroprevalance information available. It
suggests that prior infection by one of the hantaviruses is between 9% and
40% of tested populations. Some references (percentages of positive follow
the NLM cite) are:

[David is quite right. The mortality rate given in the aforesaid mentioned
message was for people with HPS. The antibody prevalence of individual
hantaviruses varies by the virus and the study done. Last I saw, in the
U.S. the mortality rate was 43%; most of that was due to Sin Nombre virus.
Thanks for the correction. - Mod. CHC
