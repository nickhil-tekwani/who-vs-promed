national public health authorities.
2. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of Affected Areas.
3. One death attributed to Hong Kong SAR occurred in a case medically
transferred from Viet Nam.
[B] The list of affected areas can be accessed at
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/2003_04_25/en/> and is unchanged from
previous reports.
[C] Update 39 - Optimism in Viet Nam, caution urged when using diagnostic
tests 25 Apr 2003 <http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_25/en/>
Viet Nam may soon become the first country to contain SARS. No new cases of
SARS have been detected in Viet Nam for 17 days in a row, despite a high
level of awareness and good surveillance. Although numerous rumors have
been reported, all have been investigated by WHO and government officials,
and all suspect cases have been determined to have other causes.
The most recent probable case was detected on 8 Apr 2003, bringing the
cumulative total in Viet Nam to 63 cases. Detection of that case initially
brought disappointment, as it occurred after no new cases had been reported
over an 8 day period. Since the outbreak was first recognized in Hanoi in
late February [2003], 5 deaths have occurred. As of today, 5 patients
remain in hospital.
Viet Nam was the second country to experience a SARS outbreak. The first
was China, where an outbreak began in Guangdong Province in mid-November
[2002].
If no new cases are detected by 30 Apr 2003 (a date which marks the end of
2 incubation periods), Viet Nam could become the first country to be taken
off the list of SARS-affected countries. This achievement would also make
Viet Nam the first country to successfully contain its SARS outbreak.
SARS was first identified by Dr Carlo Urbani, a WHO infectious disease
specialist. Dr Urbani alerted the world to SARS when cases of an unusual
and severe respiratory disease began appearing among health staff treating
a Chinese-American businessman at the French Hospital in Hanoi. The
patient, a 48 year old resident of Hong Kong, was admitted to hospital on
26 Feb 2003 with fever and respiratory symptoms. His recent travel history
included trips to Guangdong Province, Shanghai, and Macao SAR. By 20 Mar
2003, at least 22 staff at the Hanoi hospital were ill with influenza-like
symptoms. 20 had signs of pneumonia, and 2 were in serious condition. The
Chinese-American businessman died of SARS in Hong Kong on 13 Mar 2003. Dr
Urbani died of SARS in Thailand on 29 Mar 2003. WHO country staff attribute
Viet Nam's success in combating SARS to the quick manner in which the
country initially reacted. "After Carlo identified the disease, we were
able to influence the hospital to take the right infection control measures
very quickly," said Pascale Brudon, the WHO representative in Viet Nam.
The commitment of the Vietnamese government came soon thereafter, including
high-level support for a WHO coordinated response in Hanoi. "The first
priority was to contain the disease and monitor each case," said Brudon.
International collaboration to combat SARS came quickly via the Japanese
government and Medecins sans Frontieres, who both worked under the umbrella
of the WHO initiative in Viet Nam.
Viet Nam was fortunate in that the country had only a single index case,
who spent less than 3 days in Hanoi prior to hospitalization. This short
time in the community effectively limited opportunities to transmit the
SARS virus to a contained hospital environment.
Viet Nam's northern Quang Ninh province recently began barring Chinese
tourists at its overland border with China in an effort to prevent
importation of SARS. This move comes ahead of any decision by the
Vietnamese national government to seal its border with China indefinitely,
as has been recommended by the country's ministry of health.
WHO is currently working with 4 major laboratories to develop a clinically
validated diagnostic test for SARS. Standard test reagents are being
established to assess the quality of the test and ensure its reliability.
When the test has been developed and clinically validated, it can be used
reliably to confirm cases of SARS. However, test development and validation
are expected to take at least another 2 weeks.
In the meantime, laboratories in a growing number of countries have
developed SARS diagnostic tests, often based on information made available
at the WHO web site. It is extremely important for national authorities and
medical and hospital staff to understand the limitations of currently
available tests. Their use as the basis for treatment decisions may give a
false sense of security that can allow persons carrying the SARS virus, and
therefore capable of infecting others, to escape detection.
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 4649 cases with 274 deaths have been
reported from 26 countries. This represents an additional 210 cases and 11
deaths when compared with yesterday. The new deaths were reported in China
(5) and Hong Kong SAR (6).
In China, the Ministry of Health has today informed WHO of 180 newly
reported probable cases. The breakdown by location is Beijing (103), Inner
Mongolia (23), Guangdong (15), Tianjin (13), Hebei (12), Shanxi (11), and
one case each in Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan. These latest figures bring
the cumulative number of probable cases reported in China to 2601. Among
health workers, a total of 38 new probable cases were reported from Beijing
(17), Tianjin (9), Hebei (5), Inner Mongolia (5), Shanxi (1), and Guangdong
(1).
Beijing reported 3 deaths, Shanxi 1, and Guangdong 1, bringing the
cumulative number of deaths in China to 115. The fact that cases continue
to occur in health workers underscores the need for better infection
control in hospitals. In Beijing, WHO is still awaiting data giving dates
of onset and the location of cases in order to fully assess the situation.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 25 Apr 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 25 Apr 2003, there are an additional 22 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 4 health care workers (one from Caritas Medical Centre, one
from Union Hospital, one from Tseung Kwan O Hospital, and one from Tuen Mun
Hospital). The remaining 18 are other patients and contacts of patients
with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 614 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals, including 47 discharged today. There
are also 126 recovering patients who are in convalescence and preparation
for discharge. 105 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care units.
6 patients died in Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH), Princess
Margaret Hospital (PMH), Tai Po Hospital (TPH),Pamela Youde Nethersole
Eastern Hospital(PYNEH), and United Christian Hospital (UCH). This brought
to 115 the total number of deaths related to atypical pneumonia. The
deceased are aged from 35 to 96 and include 2 women and 4 men [2 were
otherwise healthy individuals under age 50].
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases / total no. discharged patients / total no. deaths*
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students: 342 / 136 / ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1168 / 478 / ?
Total: 1510 ** / 614 / 115
Suspected cases: 29
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.
** There are 126 recovering patients in convalescence.
[Readers are reminded there is a daily SARS bulletin on the Hong Kong
Department of Health SARS website under "Atypical pneumonia information."
There is a table on the age and sex distribution of cases and a bar graph
on the geographic distribution of cases by residential district. Of note, 6
per cent of reported cases are in the 0 to 14 year old age group, 11 per
cent in the 15 to 24 year old age group <http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/ap.htm>.
Of additional note, Hong Kong has begun taking the temperature of all
arrivals into Hong Kong via air, land, or ferry. There were plans to
install infrared thermal imaging systems (ITIS) for the detection of
travelers with fever at all entry points. - Mod.MPP]

Taiwan SARS Update 25 Apr 2003
------------------------------
Taiwan CDC announces that people who had been to Hoping Hospital, Taipei
during the period [8-23 Apr 2003?] should have daily temperature checked,
wear masks, and seek immediate medical services should symptoms arise. The
health authorities have adopted the vigorous measures of closing the
hospital and confining all patients and staff members in the hospital for
at least 14 days. Any people who cared for patients in the emergency room
or wards 7A, 7B, and 8B during the period of [8-23 Apr 2003?] are being
quarantined at home.
Taiwan CDC recommends that fix one physician [?] for medical services; as
an alternative, people can call their physician for general consultation;
if they visit a physician, please wear masks.
As of 3:00 PM on 25 Apr 2003, there were 250 possible SARS cases reported:
49 probable, 65 suspected, 89 excluded, and 47 pending cases. Compared with
the previous day, this represents an increase of 8 probable cases. In
accordance with WHO guidelines, 25 of the 49 probable cases and 42 of the
65 suspected cases have been discharged to home quarantine, while the
remaining 24 probable cases and 23 suspected cases are still being cared
for in negative pressure rooms. A total of 138 possible SARS cases have
been discharged from hospitals.
As of 2:00 PM on 25 Apr 2003, a total of 2051 close contacts of probable
SARS cases had been assigned to home quarantine; 1638 of them have
completed their quarantines.
On 24 Apr 2003, 9 incoming passengers and 2 outbound passengers at CKS
International Airport had fever. 3 passengers were referred for medical
evaluation and 2 of them were admitted to hospital. 1 incoming passenger at
Kaohsuing International Airport had fever, but did not require further
medical evaluation.

Update 38 - severe acute respiratory syndrome
---------------------------------------------
As of 24 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 327 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 16 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to
specific transmission settings such as households, hospitals and specific
community settings. The information contained in this update is based on
the information available to Health Canada at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 136 probable and 121 suspect cases.
British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 54 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
Total no. of probables discharged: 72
Total no. of probables recovering at home: 2
Total no. of suspects discharged: 78
Total no. of suspects recovering at home: 61
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 24 Apr 2003.
Health Canada Reaction to WHO travel advice
On 23 Apr 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) extended its
recommendation to postpone non-essential travel to include Toronto.
Health Canada formally challenged the WHO's assertion that Toronto is an
unsafe place to visit through a letter sent today to WHO. This morning,
senior Health Canada and Ontario Ministry of Health officials met with WHO
officials by teleconference. They reiterated our position that the WHO
decision is based on outdated data and asked that they rescind the advice
immediately. Health minister Anne McLellan also outlined our objections in
a call today with Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, the director general of WHO.
Health Canada does not support the WHO's position; it is safe to travel to
Toronto.
We have a clear understanding of the specific settings in which this virus
has been transmitted in Canada and confidence in the steps being taken to
manage infection control.
A CDC travel alert provides a more accurate assessment of the situation in
Canada. It states that: "Currently, all cases in Toronto are linked to
Toronto's original index case and spread has been through person-to-person
contact. SARS transmission in Toronto has been limited to a small number of
hospitals, households, and specific community settings."

[7] Comments
[A]
Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2003 18:38:00 +0800
From: Ding-Ping Liu <dpliu@cdc.gov.tw>
[In response to the comment in the ProMED-mail posting of 24 Apr 2003 (SARS
- worldwide (67): cases 20030424.1007)], the information provided in CDC's
MMWR article [4][B] with the results of current laboratory testing is
curious. According to this article, of the 245 reported combined suspected
and probable cases, 45 (18 per cent) had positive laboratory tests for the
SARS-associated coronavirus; 39 of the 245 (15.9 per cent) had negative
results, 32 suspected and 7 probable cases (7 out of 37 probable cases or
19 per cent) were negative for the SARS associated coronavirus), and 6 of
the probable cases (16 per cent) were reported to have positive tests for
the SARS-associated coronavirus.
We found in this original CDC MMWR article, CDC described the cases as
below: "As of April 23, of the 245 reported SARS cases, 45 (18 per cent)
have diagnostic SARS-CoV laboratory findings (i.e., positive findings based
on detection of antibody to SARS-CoV in serum or evidence of virus in
respiratory specimens by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
analysis, or negative findings based on absence of antibody to SARS-CoV in
convalescent serum obtained >21 days after symptom onset)."
It would be more accurate to say that among the 245 reported cases, 45
cases have been laboratory-tested and have conclusive results (positive and
negative). 39 of these 45 lab-tested cases were negative for SARS-CoV, and
only 6 cases of these 45 have been found to have laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV infection. Since there are still 24 cases pending final lab
results among the total 37 probable cases, the positive or negative rate is
not yet available. Perhaps we should only say that there are 6 positive and
7 negative among the 13 tested probable cases.
We hope this rephrasing will help your readers understand the whole picture
better. Thank you for your attention.

In "SARS - worldwide (67): cases, the moderator's interpretation of the CDC
SARS laboratory results are inaccurate. Only 13 "probable" cases have
completed testing: 6 had a positive* result and in 7 the results were
negative**.
*Positive antibody test OR positive PCR.
**No antibody detected in convalescent (>21 days post-symptom onset) serum.

[As of 25 Apr 2003 a cumulative total of 4649 probable cases of SARS, with
274 deaths, have been reported to WHO from 27 countries. In the past 24
hours an additional 210 cases have been reported, of which 179 were
reported to have occurred in China and 22 in Hong Kong. China is now
reporting new cases from Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong , Tianjin,
Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan.
To date, 2206 cases have been reported to have recovered (47.5 per cent),
with outcomes on 2169 (46.7 per cent) of patients still pending. This is
relevant when one starts to calculate the case fatality rate, as outcomes
on almost half of the cases are still pending. The newswires have been
filled with discussions of "increasing case fatality rates," because the
early rates mentioned were less than 4 per cent, and now rates are
approaching 5 per cent. Readers should be reminded that until the outcomes
of all cases are known, and we have a means of determining the numbers of
infected individuals (including those with mild to minimal or no illness),
we will have no "true" denominator to permit an accurate calculation of the
true case fatality rate associated with infection with the SARS-associated
virus.
It is noteworthy that Viet Nam is approaching 2 incubation periods since
the date of onset of the last reported probable case of SARS (30 Apr 2003
will be 20 days since the last case's onset). If no additional cases are
reported, the country will be removed from the affected areas list.
This moderator would like to thank Drs Liu and Deresinski for pointing out
that the correct denominator for numbers of probable SARS cases that have
had laboratory studies completed is 13 (representing 35 per cent of
reported probable SARS patients as of the date of that analysis). Of these
13 probable cases, 7 were negative for the SARS associated coronavirus, and
6 were positive. While this does "increase" the proportion tested that were
positive, these different percentages do not change this moderator's
opinion stated in the 24 Apr 2003 posting: "It appears the verdict is not
yet in on the sensitivity and specificity of currently available tests, or
whether the SARS-associated coronavirus is the "full answer". - Mod.MPP]
