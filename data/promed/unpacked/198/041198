With 9 persons testing positive for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, in Wayanad over the past 2 months [January-February 2020], the Wayanad district administration has intensified the disease prevention and surveillance activities and has asked the people to maintain vigilance.

District collector Dr. Adeela Abdulla said that 7 KFD cases were reported last year [2019] during the same period, including 2 deaths, and there have been 9 positive cases this year [2020]. "We are asking people from tribal colonies and those living on forest fringes to maintain [vigilance]. People have been advised to seek medical help if they have fever or other complications," she said.

The district collector said a joint meeting of officials from the neighbouring district across the border in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu will be convened soon to strengthen preventive measures. A control room has been opened to monitor the disease and help people with information and support (04936 204151, toll-free 1077).

District medical officer Dr. R. Renuka said that disease surveillance and precautionary measures have been stepped up as the KFD season, which normally coincides with the summer months, could extend till May [2020]. She added that all the KFD cases reported this year [2020] have been from the Thirunelly panchayat, which is surrounded by forests.

"All those venturing into forests for collection of minor forest produce, wood, etc., should get themselves vaccinated," she said.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), which is transmitted to humans by a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, commonly a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described to date (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/transmission/index.html).

Recommended preventive measures against KFDV include vaccination of the at-risk population in the reported area and public education on use of insect repellents and protective clothing when outdoors or entering any nearby forests. - Mod.UBA
