Re: SMALL POX VACCINATION FOR TRAVELERS TO AFRICA ---
John Water's comments (Monkeypox - Zaire [05]) are well taken. Also consider
that persons with active small pox vaccination ulcerations may pose a risk to
immune compromised persons in Africa of which there are now a considerable
number. Thus, if zoologists and others who may work with high risk animals
in Africa are indeed vaccinated, lesions should be fully healed and thus not
infectious to others when they leave for Africa.
