[Following our request for information in archived 20101229.4585, we
have received the following observations from Dr Talib Murad]:

Foot and Mouth Disease and other TAD's Reporting System in Iraq and
Near East Countries
----------------------------------------
Quite frankly, it is of grave concern that our neighbours are
encountering so much of this TAD (Transboundry Animal Disease) but at
least they are endeavouring to monitor the situation in their countries.

The question arises as to why Iraq has not submitted any samples to
WRLFMD (Pirbright UK), the World Reference Laboratory for FMD for the
last 2 years. Is this because:

1. We do not have any FMD in Iraq; highly unlikely, given the
situation in Turkey and Iran, who are transparent when it comes to
animal diseases. We cannot comment on other neighbours.

2. We are not recognising suspect cases of FMD or ignoring it.

Either scenario is not acceptable as we have precious few livestock
left in the country, and we must ensure that we protect what we have.

We know that the Iranian and Turkish veterinary services are more
developed now than the Iraqi service; nevertheless both are using the
Pirbright-UK facility on a regular basis, as indeed other neighbours
are doing. Why are we failing to use a service that is readily
available and free and which can give us peace of mind with regard to
this disease? UN agencies (most are based in Jordan for the last 7
years) are well funded in Iraq, and it should be utilised by the
Iraqi veterinary service.

Do we have any strategic vaccines available in the country?

When I was FAO Regional Officer, I knew everything regarding
facilities in all the countries of the Middle East and North Africa
with the exception of Iraq. Now I am in Iraq but not wiser!

My advice is that we in Iraq and indeed in most of the countries of
the region must have a good reporting and recording system, be fully
transparent, and use all facilities available to us.

I am ready to help with this important issue.

[Dr Talib Murad's observations are gratefully acknowledged. His
concerns are justified and shared; we join his expectation for
samples from Iraq, either already available or to be derived soon
from adequate animals, to be submitted to the WRLFMD for
identification, serotyping and genotyping. This is particularly
important to exclude exotic strains.

Initiative from the side of international agencies, such as the FAO
and EUFMD, to enhance such sampling and particularly to assist in
their transportation to Pirbright, will be commendable. Obviously,
such samples deserve to be collected also from livestock in the KRG area.

FAO Technical Cooperation Department/Field Programme Activities
includes, in its current list of operationally active projects for
Iraq, the project OSRO/IRQ/707/UDG, "Strengthening the capacity of
the Iraqi Veterinary Services for control of Zoonotic and
Transboundary Animal Diseases" (funded, for the period 2009-2011, at
USD 3 001 714).

Extensive surveillance activities are ongoing in Iran and Turkey;
they, as well as reports from Syria and Lebanon, were reviewed during
the 79th Session of the EUFMD Executive Committee, held in Stockholm,
Sweden, 16-17 Mar 2010 (the 79th Session report, including 22
appendices, is available at
<http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/en/eufmd/execom_79report_txt.html>).
