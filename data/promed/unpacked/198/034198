Residents of Belagatta village in Chitradurga taluk seem to be suffering
from a mysterious disease. While avian influenza is creating havoc [in
poultry elsewhere] in the country, people from this village are reported to
be suffering from some strange [undiagnosed] disease. A similar situation
was reported [earlier] from Devasamudra village of Molakalmuru taluk, near
Bellary district.
People are reported to be suffering from symptoms of severe cold, fever,
and joint pain. This strange disease has proved to be a challenge to the
officials of the Health department. They are unable to diagnose it.
The disease is found in different age groups. By evening, the patients
start shivering from severe cold, followed by fever and joint pains. The
pain is so severe that it leaves the patients crippled, unable to move
around or attend to their daily chores. Also it worsens with swelling in
the hands and legs of the patients. The [same] symptoms [have been]
reported in the surrounding areas of Devasamudra village, for the last [4
weeks]. Now this affliction has been reported from Belagatta and the nearby
areas.
Health officials have collected blood samples for tests. Initially the
doctors had suspected that this [might] be leprosporiasis [leptospirosis?].
But laboratory reports [suggest] the presence of virus in the blood
samples. District health officer Dr S Rangaswami told the Deccan Herald
that this [undiagnosed disease] could be a kind of viral fever.
A team of health experts, officials, health supervisors, and virologists
have been visiting the affected areas and are investigating. Dr Rangaswami
said blood samples have been sent to NICD [National Institute of
Communicable Diseases], Bangalore, for serology tests. [In addition]
measures are being taken to [provide] clean drinking water, and to supply
phenol and bleaching powder [for disinfection]. All measures are being
taken to step up cleanliness and hygiene. Health officials are remaining]
in these villages to bring the mysterious disease under control.
