During the second half of 1994 and the first half of 1995 there were nine
cases of listeriosis reported in Varmland. Usually there is not more than
one case each year in Varmland. Six of the cases were men over 70 years old
and three cases were pregnant women.
Almost everybody had eaten salmon-like fish (in most cases rainbow trout)
during the last six months. The fishes had been fermented or smoked.
Several of these people had eaten rainbow trout from the same manufacturer
A. Samples were collected from several food shops and from the manufacturer
A. Six of the samples from the humans had typing (biochemical
characterization, serotyping, phage typing and REA + PFGE) belonging to the
same clone as the _Listeria monocytogenes_ which had been isolated from the
rainbow trout from manufacturer A.
Probably six cases of nine had been caused by consuming rainbow trout from
manufacturer A.

caused by rainbow trout. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (in press).
