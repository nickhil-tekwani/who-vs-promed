Escherichia coli O157 outbreak in Lincolnshire:
Three cases of Escherichia coli O157 infection were identified in
Lincolnshire late in February 1997. Their only common exposure was having
eaten on consecutive days (20 to 22 February 1997) at a particular public
house that caters for families. A helpline was set up in response to
widespread local publicity. Three hundred and thirty-two people who ate at
the pub and had symptoms have contacted the helpline, 163 by 7 March when a
case control study began. The PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens confirmed
that seven isolates received from people who had eaten at the pub and from
one member of staff were strains of E. coli O157 phage type 2, Verocytotoxin
type 2 indistinguishable by subtyping methods. Three people were admitted to
hospital, one with haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS).
The pub has 70 staff, serves over 3000 meals each week, and is part of a
national chain. Inspection of the kitchens revealed several minor problems
but no major defects. The owners took remedial action and closed the pub
voluntarily until the outbreak was declared over. Most of the food was
disposed of during deep cleaning, but some was obtained for microbiological
testing. Tests on the food for E. coli O157 were all negative.
The PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (Trent) and North Kesteven
District Council carried out a case control study with help from CDSC. A
case was defined as someone who ate at the pub between 16 and 24 February
and developed microbiologically confirmed E.coli O157 infection, or bloody
diarrhoea, or HUS, or fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Thirty-two cases
fulfilled one or other of these definitions.
One hundred and twenty-six controls were obtained from addresses supplied by
customers in a marketing exercise at the pub during the outbreak period. The
study revealed no association between illness and any one food - several
unrelated dishes were found to be independently associated with illness. The
original source of the outbreak remains
unknown.
