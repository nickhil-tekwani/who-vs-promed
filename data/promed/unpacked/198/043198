Abstract
--------
To elucidate the evolutionary pathway, we sequenced the entire genomes of 89 H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) isolated in Japan during winter 2016-2017 and 117 AIV/HPAIVs isolated in Japan and Russia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that at least 5 distinct genotypes of H5N6 HPAIVs affected poultry and wild birds during that period. Japanese H5N6 isolates shared a common genetic ancestor in 6 of 8 genomic segments, and the PA and NS genes demonstrated 4 and 2 genetic origins, respectively. Six gene segments originated from a putative ancestral clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 virus that was a possible genetic reassortant among Chinese clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs. In addition, 2 NS clusters and a PA cluster in Japanese H5N6 HPAIVs originated from Chinese HPAIVs, whereas 3 distinct AIV-derived PA clusters were evident. These results suggest that migratory birds were important in the spread and genetic diversification of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs.

[The role of migratory birds in the epidemiology and global spread of avian influenza strains, which was subject to heated discussions during the 2000's, is revisited in the above paper. To remove residual doubts on the said role, some segments from the discussion chapter of the paper are herewith copied (omitted references and figures are available in the original paper at the source URL above).

"Discussion
-----------
Our results show that the clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs that spread to Japan in 2016-2017 originated due to reassortment with co-circulating HPAIVs and AIVs. It is noteworthy that the PA genes of the Japanese H5N6 HPAIVs arose from 3 distinct origins in AIVs circulating in wild birds. Reassortment events among Asian-lineage H5 HPAIVs with wild bird AIVs have been reported previously for other H5 HPAIV clades. Our previous study showed that the PA genes of the clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 HPAIVs that affected poultry and wild birds in Japan in 2010-2011 were closely related to Eurasian wild-bird isolates. A recent analysis of 579 clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs isolated from poultry, mammalian species such as pigs and human, and the environment in China revealed that 41, 4.5, and 2.6 percents of these viruses had likely acquired their PB2, PB1, and PA genes, respectively, from wild-bird AIVs. In addition, novel-reassortant clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx HPAIVs that have acquired one or more internal gene segments from AIVs in wild birds have been reported frequently worldwide since the emergence of Korean H5N8 HPAIVs in 2014. How migratory birds contribute to the maintenance of Asian lineage H5 HPAIVs is unknown, but although the habitats of wild birds and poultry are generally distinct, exchanges of AIV genome segments between wild birds and poultry populations undoubtedly have occurred. Chen et al. emphasize the importance of live poultry markets as focal points for the exchange of gene segments between wild birds and poultry in China.

Thus, wild-bird populations have accelerated not only the genetic diversity of the recent Asian-lineage H5 HPAIVs but also may play an important role in their maintenance.

The intracontinental connections apparent in the phylogenies of the AIV-derived PA genes of the Japanese H5N6 HPAIVs suggest the important contribution of the migration of wild birds to the movement of HPAIVs. The role of migratory birds in the dissemination of HPAIVs became clear in 2005, when clade 2.2 H5 HPAIVs spread from Qinghai Lake in China to European countries and the African continent. Qinghai Lake is a breeding site for migratory birds wintering in Southeast Asia and the wintering site for migratory birds that breed in Siberia; in other words, it is the intersection of different flyways. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the intercontinental spread of clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 HPAIVs from Asia to Europe and North America in 2014-2015 can be attributed to migratory birds. Japan is a wintering site for various species of migratory birds, including mallard ducks (_Anas platyrhynchos_) and hooded cranes (_Grus monacha_). Indeed, Eurasian lineage AIVs were frequently isolated from these species during the wintering season in Japan, suggesting the strong possibility that the H5N6 HPAIVs analyzed in the current study were carried into Japan by their hosts from breeding sites during their winter migration. The tMRCA [time to the most recent common ancestor] we analyzed suggest that potential progenitors, such as genotype C2, which is derived from the G1.1.9 and G1.1 genotypes, had emerged before early 2016. In addition, each AIV-derived PA cluster was closely related to the Eurasian AIVs isolated in the summer or fall of 2015, whereas the H5N6 outbreaks in Japan began in Fall 2016.

In light of the evolutional pathway of the Japanese-Korean H5N6 HPAIVs, the progenitor viruses might have been transported by migratory birds from China to their breeding sites in Spring 2016 and then travelled to both Korea and Japan in Fall 2016, when their hosts flew through the East Asian flyway for wintering. Although the live poultry trade is considered to be a risk factor for the wide geographic dissemination of Asian-lineage H5 HPAIVs, Japan bans the import of live poultry and poultry products from countries and areas that are affected by HPAI, including China and South Korea. Therefore, it is less likely that a progenitor of Japanese H5N6 HPAIVs was introduced into Japan through the poultry trade." - Mod.AS]
