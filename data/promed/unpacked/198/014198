Hybrid Turkeys is confirming that the case of H1N1 [virus] is located
at one of our barns in Ontario. We are asking the media to respect
the strict biosecurity measures in place at our turkey farms. As
caretakers to the health and wellbeing of our turkey flocks, we
respectfully request that media discontinue visiting our turkey
farms. Our stringent biosecurity program includes a shower-in /
shower-out policy for anyone authorized to enter the barns, and the
limitation of visitors around the farm.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed that the
cause of an egg production drop in a flock in a single barn of Hybrid
Grand Parent Breeding turkeys in Ontario was due to the novel H1N1
influenza virus. Recently novel H1N1 was reported as the cause of an
egg production drop in turkey breeding hens in Chile where employees
also were seen as the source.

The only [sign] in the affected Ontario flock was a decrease in egg
production with no associated illness or mortality. The flock is
showing normal feed and water consumption and is expected to fully
recover, consistent with other flus that are more common in turkeys.

The most likely source of the virus is from human transmission. A
limited number of employees prior to the egg production drop
exhibited "cold-like" symptoms and one sought medical attention.
Employee health is being monitored and some employees are now being
tested for the virus.

Influenza is not transmissible from hatching eggs or through the
consumption of turkey meat, which continues to be a safe, healthy
product. We have been working closely with the CFIA since the
identification of the egg production drop. We received notification
of the novel virus late yesterday [19 Oct 2009]. A self-imposed
quarantine remains in effect and will until the flock is fully recovered.

Hybrid Turkeys, A Division of Hendrix Genetics Ltd.
Hybrid Turkeys, is a primary breeder of turkeys based in Kitchener,
Ontario, Canada. The company produces high quality eggs and poults
for parent stock customers around the world. Hybrid Turkeys has
approximately 180 employees working in various locations across
Canada, USA, France, and Germany.

[Many thanks to Robert Palmer from the University of Toronto for
drawing our attention to this press release.

Primary breeders in turkey production schemes have a key role in
developing the genetic composition of the industry, so Hybrid's
concern over biosecurity is a long standing policy that they are
reemphasizing in this press release. Clearly, they want everyone to
take careful precautions not to bring other diseases than influenza
onto their farms as they become the center of widespread interest.

Again, the most likely suspect in the transmission of the new
pandemic H1N1 strain is sick workers, as was supposed in other
situations. However, we should not jump to any conclusions until CFIA
does a thorough investigation. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency
houses veterinarians and other professionals who investigate and
control disease outbreaks. The 1st novel, pandemic H1N1 outbreak in
North America, which occurred in Alberta, Canada, was first assumed
to be due to a Canadian carpenter who had just returned from Mexico
and worked on the outbreak farm. However, subsequent tests failed to
confirm this initial assumption. We should likewise await the results
of the CFIA investigation on this turkey farm and hope they will be
lucky enough to be more definitive about whether this H1N1 infection
in this grandparent stock farm started with sick people or not.
Clearly the most likely source is people but as the number of these
zooanthroponotic (reverse or human to animal) transmissions will
likely increase as more people get sick, intensive and thorough
outbreak investigations might be help clear up nagging directionality
questions. - Mod.PC]
