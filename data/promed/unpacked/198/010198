Abstract
--------
Recently a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has emerged from Wuhan, China, causing symptoms in humans similar to those caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Since SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002, extensive structural analyses have revealed key atomic-level interactions between SARS-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and its host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which regulate both the cross-species and human-to-human transmissions of SARS-CoV. Here we analyzed the potential receptor usage by 2019-nCoV, based on the rich knowledge about SARS-CoV and the newly released sequence of 2019-nCoV [now called SARS-CoV-2].

First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV [SARS-CoV-2] RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV for human cell infection. Third, several other critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Asn501) are compatible with, but not ideal for, binding human ACE2, suggesting that 2019-nCoV has acquired some capacity for human-to-human transmission. Last, while phylogenetic analysis indicates a bat origin of 2019-nCoV, 2019-nCoV also potentially recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species (except mice and rats), implicating these animal species as possible intermediate hosts or animal models for 2019-nCoV infections. These analyses provide insights into the receptor usage, cell entry, host cell infectivity and animal origin of 2019-nCoV, and may help epidemic surveillance and preventive measures against 2019-nCoV.

[The Discussion section of the paper, authored by researchers in Minnesota and North Carolina, includes the following segment which is of particular significance from the One Health perspective (for convenience, 2019-nCoV, the term applied when the manuscript was published online, has been replaced in the following excerpt by the current official term, SARS-CoV-2):

"What is the source of SARS-CoV-2 and did a key intermediate host play an important role in the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak? Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 most likely has originated from bats, given its close phylogenetic relationship with other beta-genus lineage b bat SARS-CoV. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 likely recognizes ACE2 from a diversity of animal species, including palm civets, as its receptor. In the case of SARS-CoV, some of its critical RBM residues were adapted to human ACE2, while some others were adapted to civet ACE2; this type of partial viral adaptations to 2 host species promoted virus replication and cross-species transmission between the 2 host species.

"In the case of SARS-CoV-2, however, there is no strong evidence for adaptive mutations in its critical RBM residues that specifically promote viral binding to civet ACE2. Hence, either palm civets were not intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, or they passed SARS-CoV-2 to humans quickly before SARS-CoV-2 had any chance to adapt to civet ACE2.

"Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will likely replicate inefficiently in mice and rats, ruling them out as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we predict that either SARS-CoV-2 or laboratory mice and rats would need to be genetically engineered before a robust mouse or rat model for SARS-CoV-2 would become available.

"Pigs, ferrets, cats, and non-human primates contain largely favorable 2019-nCoV-contacting residues in their ACE2, and hence may serve as animal models or intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.

"It is worth noting that SARS-CoV was isolated in wild palm civets near Wuhan in 2005, and its RBD had already been well adapted to civet ACE2 (except for residue 487). Thus, bats and other wild animals in and near Wuhan should be screened for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2." [references omitted, available at the source URL above].

From an epidemiological perspective, and in view of an unexplained source of infection in several recent COVID-19 patients, pets, and in particular, cats kept in patients' premises, should be tested, hopefully, to exclude their suggested role as possible intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2.

The 5 questions raised in relation to wild and domestic animals in the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan (20200210.6972104) remain pending. - Mod.AS]
