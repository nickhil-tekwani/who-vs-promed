The destructive wheat streak mosaic virus is rapidly spreading across
Western Australia.
Western Australia's Department of Agriculture banned wheat imports
from the eastern states earlier this year to try to stop the disease
entering the state. That ban was lifted when it was discovered after
the virus was found in a commercial crop.
Department spokesman Roger Jones says for the first time, the virus
is now being found in crops across the wheat belt.
"It is a very serious disease if there's widespread infection with
the virus in young plants, young wheat plants," he said. "It causes
stunting, the plants don't then grow and the yield is very, very low,
and what they do yield if they're infected that early is just
shrivelled grain. So that's a scenario that's very serious."

[Wheat develops symptoms of the disease wheat streak mosaic when
infected by wheat streak mosaic virus (genus: _Tritimovirus_, family:
_Potyviridae_, WSMV), which can also infect barley, maize, oats and
rye and some pasture and weed grasses. The virus is transmitted by
the eriophyid wheat curl mite (_Aceria tosichella_). WSMV causes
severe disease in some winter wheat crops in the Great Plains of
North America, with average losses of 3 percent. There is one report
(Argentina, 20040922.2614) from South America. It occurs throughout
the Mediterranean Basin at low incidence and is reported from Eastern Europe.
This report appears to confirm the expansion of the range of this
virus within Western Australia, though no specific geographic
information is provided. If any local plant pathologists have that
information then ProMED-mail would welcome a submission. This report
follows a 1st report for Western Australia dated 10 May 2006
(20060514.1364). Disease pictures and links can be found in that
posting. It is quite likely that the virus has been there for some
time in crop or other wild grass hosts.
