Albertans who may potentially encounter mice or mice droppings are encouraged to take precautionary measures following confirmed cases of a potentially fatal illness.

Alberta Health Services confirms there have been 2 cases of hantavirus [infection], an illness that affects the respiratory system, in Alberta this year [2019]. In the previous 5 years, there were 15 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections] including one that proved fatal.

Humans can contract the virus by breathing in urine or feces particles from infected rodents.

To prevent the likelihood of contracting hantavirus, AHS encourages Albertans to take proactive measures when cleaning areas where mice droppings may be found including:
- ventilate potentially infected areas for 30 minutes prior to cleaning;
- wear rubber gloves;
- soak droppings, dead mice, and mouse nests with a solution of 9 parts water to 1 part bleach (allow solution to soak for 5 minutes);
- mop droppings or pick them up with paper towels and seal them in a bag;
- avoid vacuuming mouse droppings as there is the potential for creating hantavirus-containing dust.

Anyone who develops flu-like symptoms after encountering a potentially contaminated area is encouraged to seek medical assistance immediately.

[The report above does not state if the 2 cases developed hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS), which can develop quickly and sometimes is fatal. The report does not indicate the circumstances under which the infection was acquired, nor the specific hantavirus involved in the cases. Sin Nombre virus is most likely the hantavirus responsible for these cases. This report is another reminder that closed buildings that have been little used or unused over winter often provide habitats for deer mice and become sites for human exposure to Sin Nombre virus when dust is raised during cleaning. Although Sin Nombre virus infections with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome are relatively rare, the risk of death is significant.

A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site with extensive information about hantaviruses, including those in North America, with clinical signs, treatment, and epidemiology can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/. An image of the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, can be accessed at https://mammals.carnegiemnh.org/pa-mammals/deer-mouse-peromyscus-maniculatus/.

The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America and occurs in Alberta.
