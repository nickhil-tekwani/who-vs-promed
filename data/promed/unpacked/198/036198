Rare disease affects onion crops
--------------------------------
As a result of an as yet unidentified disease, onion crops in the
region of San Quintin [Baja California] were reduced by 50 percent.

Onion growers explained that the plants "got sick" when in full
development. The problem was sudden drying of the plant, which slowed
crop development. They still do not have the results from samples that
were sent to the Local Board of Health in Ensenada.

The situation affected a large percentage of the total area planted
this year, which was approximately 500 hectares [1236 acres].

[The symptoms described above could be due to a number of pathogens
known to affect onion. Reliable diagnosis is essential before suitable
disease management strategies can be designed.
