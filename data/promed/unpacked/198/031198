Medical researchers have pinpointed a strain of antibiotic-resistant _E.
coli_ bacteria responsible for a large share of urinary tract infections,
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine reports.
The previously unrecognized strain is so common, the journal said, that the
researchers behind the study suspect it may be spreading through the
population via contaminated food. The actual source of the contamination
remains a mystery.
The research team, led by Amee R. Manges of the University of California,
said that if many of the infections were due to contaminated food, "this
would constitute a serious and novel public health problem."
In 3 states, California, Michigan and Minnesota "a single clonal group
accounted for nearly half" of the urinary tract infections in women that
were resistant to the commonly prescribed antibiotic
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the researchers reported.

[Here is a portion of the abstract from the original paper. - Mod.ES]
In all, 55 of the 255 _E. coli_ isolates (22 percent) from the California
cohort were resistant to trimethoprim­sulfamethoxazole as well as other
antibiotics. There was a common pattern of DNA fingerprinting, suggesting
that the isolates belonged to the same clonal group (clonal group A), in 28
of 55 isolates with trimethoprim­sulfamethoxazole resistance (51 percent)
and in 2 of 50 randomly selected isolates that were susceptible to
trimethoprim­sulfamethoxazole (4 percent, P<0.001). In addition, 11 of 29
resistant isolates (38 percent) from the Michigan cohort and 7 of 18 (39
percent) from the Minnesota cohort belonged to clonal group A. Most of the
clonal group A isolates were serotype O11:H(nt) or O77:H(nt), with similar
patterns of virulence factors, antibiotic susceptibility, and
electrophoretic features.
