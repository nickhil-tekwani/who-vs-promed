- Thu 19 Dec 2019. DRC: Ebola situation remains worrying in Biakato and Lwemba in Ituri
[Provinces 26 RDC, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.provinces26rdc.net/rdc-la-situation-debola-reste-toujours-preoccupante-a-biakato-et-lwemba-dans-lituri/; in English https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/12/drc-ebola-situation-remains-worrying-in-biakato-and-lwemba-in-ituri.html

In Ituri, the Ebola virus disease situation remains worrying in the localities of Biakato and Lwemba in Mambasa territory. Several contact cases that have been hidden in the community are not all identified, this after dozens of community deaths from Ebola [were] recorded during the withdrawal of the response team in the area, said the provincial minister of health, Dr. Patrick Karamura.

According to him, the challenges to be met are still enormous, especially the identification of all the contact persons, 65 of whom are under surveillance in the transit centers in Biakato.

Currently, one Ebola patient and 10 suspected cases are admitted to the Biakato treatment center, he said.

Regarding the response, Dr. Patrick Karamura reassures that measures are already taken to control this epidemic, including the training of local agents for the management of Ebola cases.

Biakato civil society, for its part, believes that the support of the population for measures to combat this virus constitutes the greatest challenge to contain this epidemic.

For their involvement, the inhabitants of Lwemba asked for the rehabilitation of the local health center, which was ransacked by the militiamen in May [2019] and the recruitment of local agents in the response team. "These are the prerequisites for breaking community resistance," they say.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/12/news-scan-dec-19-2019

Three more Ebola cases have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raising the outbreak total to 3354 cases, according to numbers reflected on the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard.

Health officials are still investigating 488 suspected cases. Also, 3 more people died from their infections, lifting the fatality count to 2220.

Yesterday [18 Dec 2019] the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said one of the 2 cases reported on 17 Dec 2019 involved a person from Butembo, marking the 1st case in the former hot spot in 54 days. The patient is a 23-year-old woman from Mabalako, one of the current outbreak epicenters. She was listed as a known contact of an earlier case-patient but had not been located for vaccination.

The woman's symptoms began on 11 Dec 2019, and she traveled to Butembo to visit her sister on 15 Dec 2019, where she was seen that day at an outpatient clinic. After some initial reluctance, she was taken to the city's Ebola treatment center. A total of 19 of the woman's contacts have been recorded, including 10 of her family members. Responders carried out ring vaccination in Butembo on 17 Dec 2019, with a similar campaign planned tomorrow [20 Dec 2019] for her contacts in Mabalako.

The other patient noted in the CMRE report was from Mabalako, one of the current outbreak epicenters.

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/12/news-scan-dec-18-2019

According to the World Health Organization (WHO's) Ebola dashboard, 2 new cases of the viral disease were recorded today [18 Dec 2019] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), raising the outbreak total to 3351 cases including 2217 deaths. Officials are still investigating 519 suspected cases.

In the latest situation report on the outbreak, the WHO said 24 new cases of Ebola were recorded from 9-15 Dec 2019, marking a resurgence of the virus in the wake of widespread violence in Beni.

At least 24 new cases in Mabalako and Beni are linked to a single transmission chain, based on one case-patient who suffered a relapse of Ebola within a 6-month period. It was not known if the patient had suffered a relapse or was re-infected, but genetic sequencing suggests the virus relapsed in the patient, the WHO said.

"The majority of recent cases are coming from a single chain of transmission that is linked to a suspected relapse of [Ebola virus disease] in an individual," the WHO said. "Although this has led to a number of secondary cases, efforts are being made to closely monitor the cases and their contacts to reduce the risk of tertiary transmission. It is thus of paramount importance that all areas of response are functional and fully resourced to bring an end to this outbreak."

3. This is the first #Ebola relapse case recorded in the North Kivu outbreak, @WHOAFRO reported. It would be interesting to know if the man who relapsed received any of the experimental Ebola therapies -- and if he did, which.
2. #Ebola relapses are rare but they have been seen before. Scottish nurse Pauline Cafferkey relapsed at least twice after surviving an infection she contracted while volunteering in the West African outbreak.

According to the Ebola survivors Association based in #Beni, there are more than 5 survivors who relapsed in this outbreak.

It would be informative to read more about these patients who relapsed. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 17 Dec 2019. DRC: Ebola virus disease - external situation report 72
[WHO/AFRO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, abridged, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/tk6g438

In the week of 9-15 Dec 2019, 24 new confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) cases were reported from 3 health zones in 2 affected provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The majority of these new confirmed cases are from Mabalako (22 of 24; 92%), and the other cases were reported from Biena (1 of 24; 4%) and Mandima (1 of 24; 4%) health zones.

The new cases from Mabalako and Biena are linked to a single chain of transmission, in which one individual was a potential source of infection for 24 people. This was the 2nd documentation of EVD illness in this individual within a 6-month period. Based on the preliminary sequencing of samples from the case, this is being classified as a relapse of EVD. Rare cases of relapse have been documented, in which a person who has recovered from EVD gets disease symptoms again, but this is the 1st documented relapse in this outbreak.

The volume of alerts reported has returned to levels seen before the security incidents in the past weeks. In general, the overall average proportion of contacts under surveillance in the last 7 days has returned to previously observed levels. However, Mabalako, the health zone with the highest volume of contacts, has the lowest performance with 73% of contacts under surveillance.

In the past 21 days (25 Nov to 15 Dec 2019), 45 confirmed cases were reported from 13 of the 87 health areas within 5 neighboring active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces: Mabalako (67%; n = 30 cases), Mandima (16%; n = 7), Beni (13%; n = 6), Oicha (2%; n = 1), and Biena (2%; n = 1). More than half (53%, n = 24) of the cases over the last 21 days have a known epidemiological link to the same transmission chain from Aloya health area in the Mabalako health zone.

As of 15 Dec 2019, a total of 3348 EVD cases, including 3230 confirmed and 118 probable cases, have been reported, of which 2213 cases died (overall case fatality ratio, 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1883) were female, 28% (941) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (169) were healthcare workers.

[3] Updates
- Tue 17 Dec 2019. Not reinfection
[Telegraph, abridged, edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/experts-breathe-sigh-relief-say-ebola-patient-not-reinfected/
[Byline: Anne Gulland]

There is relief in the Democratic Republic of Congo as authorities have said that a man thought to be reinfected with the virus was in fact suffering from a "resurgence" of the disease -- that is, the virus was still lurking in his immune system.

There was alarm last week among experts when the 1st reports came through that a patient had died after catching the deadly virus a 2nd time -- a case of reinfection with Ebola has never been documented and survivors are thought to be immune.

A post mortem confirmed that the man died because of a resurgence of the disease rather than a reinfection.

This is good news for the disease response, as Ebola survivors have been employed as so-called "lullaby singers" in treatment centres. They do not have to wear cumbersome personal protective equipment and have been particularly important in the treatment of children and babies.

The Ebola virus can hide in so-called immune sanctuaries in the body -- particularly in the brain, spinal cord, eyes, testes and bone marrow. Pauline Cafferkey, the UK nurse who contracted Ebola while responding to the 2014 to 2016 West African outbreak, had to be readmitted to hospital after suffering a resurgence of the disease 9 months after being given the all clear.

Margaret Ann Harris, a spokesperson for the World Health Organization in DRC, said that there had been cases of survivors of the deadly virus falling ill again. "We have seen some cases of resurgence in Guinea and we have also seen that death rates among survivors are higher. We know that the virus persists in some people and it can come out again," she said.

A study earlier this year [2019] showed that Ebola survivors were 5 times more likely to die in the year following their recovery than the general population.

The confirmation of resurgence is a welcome piece of good news after authorities reported a spike in Ebola cases in recent days. WHO and the DRC authorities had hoped that the outbreak -- which has infected more than 3000 people since August 2018 -- was coming to a close at the beginning of last month [November 2019]. But an upsurge in the violence that has been a hallmark of this outbreak at the end of November -- and which saw 3 responders killed -- meant that response teams were on lockdown.

Ms. Harris said that despite further violence this weekend in the town of Beni, the response is being maintained. "Much of our strategy the past year has been to up local capacity and transfer skills so now most of our responders are local people from affected communities.

"Having said that, they are also at risk -- being local doesn't protect them necessarily -- so we need much better security and better political engagement," she said.

[4] Perspective
- Wed 18 Dec 2019. Ituri: outbreak ending
[Media Congo, in French, machine trans., edited]
https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-61236_ituri_le_ministre_provincial_de_la_sante_estime_que_l_epidemie_d_ebola_tend_vers_la_fin.html

In a press briefing held on Tuesday [17 Dec 2019], the provincial health minister revealed that a total of 525 positive cases of Ebola virus epidemic have been recorded in Ituri since the onset of the disease.

There have been 261 deaths reported in 9 health zones, but to date only the Mandima region in Mambasa territory continues to register new cases to date, with a positive case of the ETC (Ebola treatment center) by Byakato, which is evolving well.

Patrick Karamura also reports that 90 alert cases are followed up in the ETC of Mambasa, including 68 cases in Mambasa center, 9 in Komanda, 9 in Byakato and 3 in Bunia.

Minister Karamura, while appealing to the population for frank collaboration with the response team, believes, however, that the epidemic is coming to an end in Ituri.

"Certainly the epidemic is tending towards the end, but we must put in a lot of effort so that our province is not reassigned. We invite the public to report to the response team all alerts of suspected cases with similar signs of bleeding. I invite the entire population to collaborate with the response team to continue to detect the other cases suffering from high fevers," he explained to Bunia Actualite.

Ituri had recorded its 1st case of this deadly epidemic since September of last year [2018] in this same health area of Mandima, bordering the locality of Mangina in North Kivu, epicenter of the contagion.

[FDA (Food and Drug Administration) abridged, edited]
https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/first-fda-approved-vaccine-prevention-ebola-virus-disease-marking-critical-milestone-public-health

The US Food and Drug Administration announced today [19 Dec 2019] the approval of Ervebo, the 1st FDA-approved vaccine for the prevention of Ebola virus disease (EVD), caused by Zaire ebolavirus, in individuals 18 years of age and older. Cases of EVD are very rare in the USA, and those that have occurred have been the result of infections acquired by individuals in other countries who then traveled to the USA, or healthcare workers who became ill after treating patients with EVD.

"While the risk of Ebola virus disease in the USA remains low, the US government remains deeply committed to fighting devastating Ebola outbreaks in Africa, including the current outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo," said Anna Abram, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Policy, Legislation, and International Affairs. "Today's approval is an important step in our continuing efforts to fight Ebola in close coordination with our partners across the US Department of Health and Human Services, as well as our international partners, such as the World Health Organization. These efforts, including today's landmark approval, reflect the FDA's unwavering dedication to leveraging our expertise to facilitate the development and availability of safe and effective medical products to address urgent public health needs and fight infectious diseases, as part of our vital public health mission."

The approval was granted to Merck & Co., Inc.

- Tue 17 Dec 2019. Ending Ebola
[Wellcome, abridged, edited]
https://wellcome.ac.uk/news/decade-we-made-one-worlds-deadliest-diseases-preventable-and-curable
[Byline: Jeremy Farrar]

This is the decade we made one of the world's deadliest diseases preventable and curable.

Epidemics are among our greatest health threats, and they strike quickly. How could vaccine or treatment studies be contemplated, when they take years and require complex ethical and regulatory systems quite unsuited to the speed needed in outbreak responses? And, though a threat to us all wherever we live, epidemics often strike 1st in regions with the most fragile of health systems.

Despite these considerable challenges, there were researchers, governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), aid agencies, charities, industry and funders, including Wellcome, willing to come together.

It is thanks to collaborations that in November [2019] the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved licensure of the Merck Ebola Vaccine (Ervebo); that, earlier this year, trials of 4 potential treatments have identified that 2 significantly increase the chances of living after being infected with Ebola; and that responders now have detailed information to help them to understand and navigate the complex local contexts in which they are working.

And finally, in Rwanda, Uganda and the DRC trials of a 2nd, complementary, preventative vaccine from Johnson & Johnson are underway.

The security situation in this complex region was then -- and remains -- febrile. Healthcare teams are, again, under attack, and the ongoing Ebola response, which was looking to have stabilised, is again under threat. There is no end to this Ebola epidemic if the violence continues. Healthcare workers must not be a target.

Our thoughts stay with all those brave and dedicated teams putting their lives at risk to protect others.

We must ensure the benefits of this research, the diagnostic tests, the vaccines, the life-saving drugs and the social science work are available, accessible and affordable to everyone who needs them independent of their ability to pay.

And we must bring the same commitment to conducting research in every epidemic.

Only by doing so can we bring hope and turn these terrifying deadly diseases into something we can prevent, treat and no longer fear.

It is right too, however, that we reflect on what has been achieved, remember that progress is possible, that we can come together to make the world a better place.

- Thu 19 Dec 2019. Interview: David Gressly
[Radio Okapi, in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.radiookapi.net/2019/12/19/actualite/politique/david-gressly-si-veut-vraiment-mettre-fin-ebola-biakato-il-faut-avoir

David Gressly: "If we really want to end Ebola in Biakato, we must have access to this area."

The United Nations Coordinator for emergency interventions for Ebola in the DRC, David Gressly, undertook a mission on Wednesday [18 Dec 2019] for a few hours in Aloya in North Kivu. In this interview with Radio Okapi, he speaks about the launch of a joint United Nations plan to fight Ebola in Biakato in Ituri. This area is considered to be the current focus of the epidemic. To end this disease, David Gressly thinks "we must have access to this area".

Radio Okapi (RO): You have just made a few hours visit to Aloya in North Kivu, what did you observe on the ground and what was the purpose of your visit to this locality?

David Gressly (DG): In fact, the objective of my visit was to better understand the current situation on the side of the response to Ebola, and also on the security level. So we had good discussions with the customary chiefs, with the security forces, with the citizens too, and I believe that the situation remains serious, I was impressed by the response by the Congolese on the site.

RO: In recent weeks, we have seen that the Ebola response teams have been the target of attacks by men in Biakato in the province of Ituri, there have even been deaths of men, have you fears that if these attacks continue, may this affect the response to Ebola?

DG: Of course it will have an impact, we can't deny that. But as I said about the situation in Aloya, even in Biakato we saw Congolese who continued the work especially at CTA and now it starts again with vaccinations.

RO: Today, at the United Nations level, is the identity of the attackers who attack the Ebola treatment centers in Lwemba, in Biakato, in Mangina known?

DG: We are working with the Security Forces but also and above all the military prosecutors either in Beni, or in Bunia depending on the qualities to give technical and logistical support for the prosecution of the criminals who were behind these attacks.

RO: David Gressly, the United Nations has just announced the launch of a joint plan to fight Ebola in Biakato in the province of Ituri. What was this plan?

DG: In fact, it is to find a way for the return to Biakato and Lwemba, which were important foci among the last foci of this epidemic. There were problems with having access to substance, especially in Lwemba in the response. So, if we really want to end this epidemic we must have access to this area, to start with, on the government side, we have already sent additional forces, MONUSCO has done the same thing, I believe that together they have secured the city of Biakato and the government used this as a basis to go forward towards Lwemba with negotiations, discussions, commitments with the population which went well yesterday and it will continue, so I believe with this device, this airlift, with the security forces, we are going to have a success in this area.
