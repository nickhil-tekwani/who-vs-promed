North Carolina health officials are investigating several cases of legionnaires' disease in people who visited a western North Carolina casino resort.

According to a news release from the Jackson County Department of Public Health and the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians Public Health and Human Services on [Wed 21 Nov 2018], 3 cases of the disease are being investigated in people who visited the Harrah's Cherokee Casino Resort in Cherokee, North Carolina from May 2018 through November 2018.

Health officials said it "cannot be confirmed whether any of the cases were exposed to" the bacterium that causes the disease while visiting the resort because the bacterium is "naturally occurring in the environment and has up to a 14-day incubation period, making it difficult to pinpoint exact location of exposure."

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia that is caused by inhaling droplets of water in the air that are contaminated with _Legionella_ bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The disease is named after an outbreak in 1976 at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.

Health officials said the casino's property management is assisting in the investigation by "treating its water system and taking steps to provide information to past and current guests."

"Outbreaks are most commonly associated with buildings or structures that have complex water systems, like hotels, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and cruise ships," according to the CDC. "Within these structures, the bacterium can become a health concern when it grows and spreads in human-made water systems, like hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, large plumbing systems, and decorative fountains."

Most people who are exposed to the bacteria do not get sick, according to health officials and the CDC. Those who are at greatest risk, the news release states, include: people 50 or older; current or former smokers; people with chronic lung disease; people with weakened immune systems or who take medications that weaken their immune systems; and people with underlying illnesses such as diabetes, kidney failure, or liver failure.

People who develop symptoms and have been to the casino resort should seek medical attention from their primary care physician, health officials said.

[According to the US CDC, about 20-25 percent of all legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is travel-associated (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5648a2.htm and http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2016/conveyance-transportation-issues/cruise-ship-travel). Travelers typically disperse to their homes widely separated from one another and perhaps at a very great distance from the source of infection before developing symptoms, so that a cluster of cases of legionnaires' disease in travelers associated with the same source may not be readily appreciated. A travel history is essential and should be actively sought from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and _Legionella_ testing should be performed for those diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of symptoms.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from the 3 cases of legionnaires' disease being investigated in people who visited Harrah's Cherokee Casino Resort in Cherokee, North Carolina from May 2018 through November 2018 will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes matched. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

Cherokee, with a population of 2138 residents, is headquarters for the Eastern Band of the Cherokee Nation; it is located in Swain and Jackson counties in western North Carolina, United States at the entrance to Great Smoky Mountains National Park and at the southern end of the Blue Ridge Parkway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee,_North_Carolina). Harrah's Cherokee Casino Resort, a casino and hotel in Cherokee, North Carolina, is owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrah%27s_Cherokee); nearly 4 million people visited Harrah's Cherokee Casino, which opened in Cherokee, NC in 1997, and generated a per capita profit of roughly USD 8000 annually (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee,_North_Carolina).
