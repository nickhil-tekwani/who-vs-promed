Re: Bovine tuberculosis - Israel: (HD) bovine, OIE 20180112.5555373

Up to 19 cows/heifers on the affected farm were found, with the comparative tuberculin test, positive. Since the worker suspected to be source of the contagion worked only a few months on the farm, it is unlikely that he transmitted _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, being primarily a human adapted pathogen, in such a brief period to so many animals. Thus it may be assumed, pending the final identification, that the pathogen involved is _M. bovis_.

[Dr Elad's assumption sounds sensible and is welcomed. We'll have to patiently wait for the final laboratory results.

In the meantime, all possible contacts of the affected herd since the start of the TB-patient's employment, including animal movements to other farms or locations, should be traced to exclude possible spread of infection. This may become of particular importance in case the agent turns to be _M.bovis_, which, as stated, is more likely to infect cattle elsewhere.

It would also help to note if all members of the Gal'on dairy farm's personnel have undergone testing. - Mod.AS]

Tuberculosis in Kibbutz Gal'On: About 10 days ago, Uri Koren ["Hachaklait" veterinary practitioner attending this dairy farm] reported about one of the plant's employees (a student from Uganda) who was hospitalized in the "Shmuel HaRofeh" hospital with active tuberculosis. The said employee has been in Israel since the beginning of September 2017. The information was transferred to the Veterinary Services at the beginning of the week [week of 7-13 Jan 2018] and the entire herd (from the age of 6 months and up) was examined by the comparative tuberculin test. This led to the identification of 19 positive animals, including 17 milking cows, one pregnant heifer and one dry cow [= in nonlactating period], out of a total of 584 tested cattle.

Untill the isolation of the reacting cows, all milk produced in the plant was destroyed. The herd has been put under quarantine.

The bacterium's species, human or bovine, has not been determined yet; this may take several weeks.

Tuberculosis is a slow disease, the positive cows do not pose an immediate risk for further infection. The positive cows will be destroyed at the beginning of the coming week [starting Sun 14 Jan 2018] and an attempt will be made to isolate the bacteria from the lymph nodes. The possible routes of infection from a sick person to animals is by aerosole during coughing or by animals' contact with the patient's sputum or other secretions.

The herd will enter a routine of tuberculin testing every 60 days and will remain in quarantine until the completion of 2 consecutive negative tests of the entire herd. Weaned calves will be tested at the age of 3 months and will be released for sale provided found negative.

Although the dimensions of the infection are unclear, there is no doubt that Uri Koren's early understanding of the significance of the information about the employee's sickness and his initiative to start the chain of alerts have played a central role in preventing further damage to this herd and to the national dairy industry at large.

[The described event is a classical case requiring a "One Health" approach: the detection of a zoonotic disease, in an animal or a human, deserves to become known to both parties, Public Health and Animal Health agencies alike, as early as possible to allow timely measures undertaken on both sides as deems necessary. According to additional information we received from a reliable source, the patient felt unwell during the last 2 weeks of Dec 2017, initially suspecting flu; eventually he could not continue working: his last working day was [Thu 28 Dec 2017]. He was then hospitalized, TB suspected on [Tue 2 Jan 2018], confirmed next day. This became known to the farm's veterinary practitioner the same day [Wed 3 Jan 2018] and the information was immediately notified, through the main office of his employer ("Hachaklait" Veterinary Services, Mutual Society for Clinical Veterinary Services and Livestock Insurance in Israel, catering for about 90 percent of the country's dairy farms) by e-mail to the State veterinary services. The flow of information between the State's Public Health and Animal Health agencies is yet to be visited.

Employees of food-producing enterprises, in Israel and elsewhere, are traditionally required by law to undergo periodical tests for infectious disease agents, in particular for tuberculosis.

On 8 Mar 2008, the Ministry of Agriculture published "Draft business licensing regulations for dairy cattle farming and sheep barns" for the public's comments. Article 25 (5) of the drafted regulations said, "A person shall not milk an animal if that person has a contagious disease, a bowel disease, a skin disease or open pustular cuts." The approval of the said regulations and their official publication and application afield has not yet been realized.

On 26 Feb 2015, Israel's Veterinary Services announced the discontinuation of periodic tuberculin testing in cattle, in effect as of 1 Mar 2015. (Hebrew, at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/VetBasade/Pirsumim/2015/Documents/mivhan__mrt.pdf). Prior to this decision, the tuberculin tests were required to be performed in each farm once in 5 years. The said announcement included, among others, the following articles 3-5:

"3. Monitoring and surveillance of TB disease is to be moved from the field to the handling by slaughterhouses. The Department of Animal Products Control will publish a monitoring procedure in the coming month.

"4. The laboratory of bacteriology at the Kimron Veterinary Institute will examine the introduction of modern bTB testing methods.

"5. The State Veterinary Services will perform risk analysis at least once every 2 years to examine the bTB epidemiological picture and ways of controlling the disease. They will update the Ministry of Health in case any changes are implemented".

Bovine tuberculosis has been eradicated in Israel in 1973, not a single case detected on a dairy farm since. The last case in grazing beef cattle was recorded in 1999. The 1st risk analysis of the bTB situation should have taken place, according to the 2015 decision, the latest 2 year after 1 Mar 2015, namely 10 months ago. In case performed, its summary and conclusions will be useful.

Notably, last week [week of Sun 31 Dec 2017], the Israeli Government published the following decision, included within the Government document "2019 budget" (page 8 in https://www.gov.il/BlobFolder/reports/sedergov080118/he/seg080118.pdf):

"To impose on the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development the establishment of an inter-ministerial team to examine the possibility of selling [!! - Mod.AS] some of the research and laboratory services of the Kimron Veterinary Institute, and accordingly to recommend the outline of the sale. The team will consult "with advice and legislation" regarding all aspects related to the legislative powers of the Institute. The composition of the team will be determined in coordination with the Deputy Attorney General (administrative-public law)" .

The 2015 expectations from the Kimron Institute's Dep of bacteriology to modernize its bTB techniques (whatever this may mean) are to be weighed against the above government decision.

The Kimron Veterinary Institute, established 1957, has been instrumental in achieving Israel's satisfactory animal health status in spite of the concerning health situation prevailing in the region, including serious zoonotic diseases (eg RVF). It includes 2 OIE reference laboratories (Brucellosis and rabies).
