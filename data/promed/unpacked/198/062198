A lethal parasite has been discovered in area canines by a local veterinarian, and its presence is troubling for animal doctors and pet owners.

Dr. Michelle Cox, veterinarian and founder of Island Pet Veterinarian Hospital located in Cape Carteret, 1st examined [D] in November 2017, when the young canine had just celebrated its 2nd birthday. "[D's] owner came to see me with her 2-year-old dog," Cox recalls. "She was extremely distraught. Her dog had started to have grand-mal seizures 7 months prior, and they were escalating in duration and frequency."

Though [the] tan, short-haired, lab mix, had been to several other vets in hopes of finding the cause of the seizures and path to recovery, nothing seemed to work. "She was a rescue dog we brought into our family from the local animal shelter," said [the owner] "She was a loving dog."

In 24 years of practicing veterinary medicine, Cox said seizures in dogs were pretty straight forward and were usually attributed to epilepsy, toxins, hypoglycemia, and brain tumors. Recently, though, Cox has had to tack a different course when confronted with seizure cases.

"When I saw [D] for the 1st time she seemed like a normal dog. I reviewed the blood work the other veterinarian had performed, and there were no abnormal findings," Cox said. "At [her] 1st visit I changed her seizure medication along with adding a medication to administer during a seizure to help shorten the length of the seizure and post-ictal period, the hours following a seizure. After several days on this medication, [her] condition had deteriorated. [She] had become disoriented and aggressive, acting completely different than she ever had before. [She] had always been a loving lap dog who was now constantly pacing, whimpering, and refusing to acknowledge her family like she once did."

It was after trying a 3rd type of anticonvulsant medication -- and seeing no improvement -- that Cox realized [D] was dealing with something completely different. Cox said she knew she was tracking a "silent killer" rarely seen or diagnosed in eastern North Carolina.

According to Cox, _Neospora caninum_ is a deadly parasite that lives in infected cattle, deer, and other deer relatives such as elk and moose. Dogs, coyotes, gray wolves, and dingoes are definitive hosts. These animals are capable of shedding oocysts in feces after eating tissue of infected hosts. _Neospora_ oocysts have an impervious shell that enables them to survive in soil and water for prolonged periods after the feces have decomposed. Intermediate hosts, such as cattle, become infected by ingesting oocysts. Once the dog eats the infected raw meat, the oocytes burst, and the life cycle of the parasite starts all over again.

Cox consulted with an internist who agreed and advised her to start [the dog] on Prednisone and 2 antibiotics and test [her] for _Neospora_. [She] immediately improved. "She went from seizing multiple times a week to not having any seizures at all. Her aggression subsided, and Kori said the pacing and whining stopped," Cox said.

Cox was pleased to learn that the medications seemed to be working but was "very surprised" when [the] _Neospora_ reading came back more than 200, a very strong positive. Cox wondered how [the dog] had contracted this disease.

Recently in Eastern North Carolina, coyotes have become very prevalent, and they are hosts for _Neospora_. Cox recalls a conversation with [the dog's owner] who said she had seen coyotes near her home in Cape Carteret and had caught [the dog] eating a deer carcass 2 months prior to the onset of her seizures.

Jodie Owen, public information officer with the N.C. Wildlife Organization, said coyotes are not only native to North America but are "found in all 100 counties of North Carolina."

Cox said after [D's] diagnosis of _Neospora caninum_ on 6 Dec 2017, she lived seizure free for nearly 6 weeks while continuing to take the medication just long enough to spend Christmas with her family and play in the snow for the 1st time. On 15 Jan 2018, [the dog] experienced 8 grand-mal seizures within 2 hours, according to Cox. [D] never regained full consciousness and she was euthanized. Cox feels because [the dog] went undiagnosed for 7 months, the parasite eventually encysted in her brain.

There is no canine vaccine preventing this disease at this time, Cox said, and the best prevention for your pet is prohibiting them from eating raw meat. Cox believes hunters should be aware and not leave carcass in the field if possible, and cattle ranchers and dairy farmers should take measures to remove deceased cattle and aborted fetuses from their farms.

Cox is currently treating a 2nd dog who came to her clinic a few weeks ago presenting different signs than [D].

[R] a 5-year-old pit mix who came in on 21 May 2018, was weak and had weight loss, according to Cox. [R's] initial test for_ Neospora_ came back "suspect" and will undergo a 2nd test in 2 weeks to get an actual reading.

"Dogs that are clinically affected and symptomatic usually do not shed oocysts in their feces. It is very rare to find this parasite in routine fecal exams. A blood test performed by your veterinarian is the best way to diagnose this disease. Early detection is paramount for full recovery," Cox said.

[What a very sad case. The outcome of such cases is not always what we wish it would be.

_Neospora_ infections in cattle may be more well known than those affecting our canine companions.

_Neospora caninum_ is a microscopic protozoan parasite with worldwide distribution. Many domestic (e.g. dogs, cattle, sheep, goats, water buffalo, horses, chickens) and wild and captive animals (e.g. deer, rhinoceros, rodents, rabbits, coyotes, wolves, foxes) can be infected. Neosporosis is one of the most common causes of bovine abortion, especially in intensively farmed cows. Neosporosis abortion also occurs in sheep, goats, water buffalo, and camelids, although they may be less susceptible than cattle.

A 2nd _Neospora_ species, _N. hughesi_, is a cause of myelitis in horses and shares clinical features with equine protozoal myelitis, which in North and South America is usually caused by _Sarcocystis neurona_. The life cycle of _N. hughesi_ is unknown. Discussion in this chapter deals only with _N. caninum_ infection.

In cattle, _N. caninum_ can be transmitted transplacentally from an infected cow to the developing fetus, an event that may occur in multiple pregnancies of the same cow. Because most congenital infections are subclinical, congenitally infected heifer calves may be retained and added to the breeding herd and, in turn, may pass infections transplacentally to their own offspring. This endogenous transplacental transmission may enable transgenerational maintenance of the parasite even if the herd does not have frequent transmission from dogs. Exogenous transplacental transmission may occur when a previously uninfected cow ingests _Neospora_ oocysts during pregnancy and the fetus becomes infected.

Dogs have been shown to become infected by eating infected cattle (including placentas) and deer and are presumed to become infected by consuming raw meat diets, barnyard chickens, and a variety of wild animals.

Most neosporosis abortions occur in mid to late gestation. Congenitally infected calves may be born weak or with neurologic deficits. However, most congenital infections are subclinical.

In dogs, subclinical infection is the rule, although there are a greater variety of exceptions. Litters or individual puppies may develop progressive hindlimb paresis associated with polyradiculoneuritis, myositis, and muscle atrophy. Adult dogs may have encephalomyelitis, focal cutaneous nodules or ulcers, pneumonia, peritonitis, hepatitis, or myocarditis with use of immunosuppressive drugs.

Clinically affected dogs often have _Neospora_ antibody levels much higher than levels seen in subclinically infected individuals. Biopsy of clinically affected tissues demonstrates nonsuppurative inflammation and may reveal the presence of protozoal organisms, but immunohistochemistry or PCR [polymerase chain reaction] may be required to detect the organisms or to differentiate them from other protozoa.

Dogs with symptomatic neosporosis usually do not shed oocysts in feces. The finding of _Neospora_ in routine fecal floats is serendipitous, because dogs typically shed oocysts for only a period of days or weeks after ingesting tissue of an infected animal. The tiny oocysts are round to slightly oval and 10-11 microns in diameter; in comparison, _Giardia_ cysts are oblong and approximately 9-13 microns, and coccidia are 2-4 times the diameter of Neospora. A smooth outer contour helps to differentiate _Neospora_ oocysts from pitted pollen grains of similar size. The oocysts are nearly identical to those of _Hammondia heydorni_, a closely related parasite that has not been associated with systemic disease in dogs or with abortion in ruminants. PCR may be necessary to distinguish between oocysts of _N caninum_ and _H heydorni_.

There is no approved treatment for neosporosis in cattle. Clinical neosporosis in dogs is treated with prolonged administration of clindamycin or potentiated sulfa drugs. The prognosis is negatively associated with the severity of presenting clinical signs and with delayed treatment. The prognosis is poor in puppies if disease has progressed to hindlimb paresis with atrophied, rigid limbs.

Currently, there are no available _Neospora_ vaccines for cattle or dogs.

In cattle it is impractical to test for this agent, but knowledge is power and therefore, knowing how to prevent the disease is critical. Knowing what to watch for and inform your veterinarian about may also provide valuable clues to the detective work the veterinarian must do.

Certainly, a take-away-message is to not feed your dog raw meat and prevent your animal from consuming placenta of other animals. To reiterate: Dogs have been shown to become infected by eating infected cattle (including placentas) and deer and are presumed to become infected by consuming raw meat diets, barnyard chickens, and a variety of wild animals.
