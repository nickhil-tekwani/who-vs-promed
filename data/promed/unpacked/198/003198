The Suffolk County Department of Health Services (SCDHS) has been notified of a laboratory confirmed case of measles in an infant who arrived recently from overseas.

The child was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center emergency room in West Islip on 19 Jan 2017 for evaluation and was released and was then seen at HRHCare Martin Luther King Jr. Family Health Center in Wyandanch on 25 Jan [2017].

To prevent the spread of measles, which is a highly communicable disease, Suffolk health officials are urging anyone who may have been exposed and who has symptoms consistent with measles to call their physicians, health care providers or emergency rooms before going for care.

If it is not possible to call ahead, individuals with symptoms should identify themselves as a potential measles patient immediately upon presentation so that others are not exposed in a waiting room.

[See full article at URL above for exposure sites, dates, times.]

Only people with 2 documented measles-containing vaccines, a blood test showing immunity, or those born (and who lived in the United States) prior to 1957 are considered immune to measles. People who have had only one measles vaccine dose should obtain a 2nd dose.

"We are in close contact with Good Samaritan Hospital, HRHCare, and the New York State Department of Health," Suffolk Commissioner of Health Services James Tomarken said. "Good Samaritan Hospital and HRHCare are reaching out to individuals who were exposed to measles on the dates of potential exposure. However, there may be others who were exposed and whose contact information we do not have. We ask anyone who was at these locations and may have been exposed to be alert for symptoms and to contact their health care providers immediately if they experience symptoms."

Individuals who may be at high-risk for complications from measles include children less than a year old, pregnant women and immunocompromised persons.

Measles symptoms generally appear in 2 stages: early symptoms include a runny nose, cough and a fever. Eyes may become reddened and sensitive to light, while the fever may gradually rise each day. Later symptoms begin on the 3rd day and consist of a temperature of 101 F [38 C] or higher, and a red, blotchy rash lasting 4-7 days. The rash usually begins on the face and then spreads over the entire body. Little white spots may also appear inside the mouth. Symptoms usually appear in 10-12 days after exposure, although they may occur as early as 7 or as late as 21 days after exposure.

Measles is spread by direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected people or by airborne transmission. Measles is one of the most contagious communicable diseases and can be contracted at any age.

After investigating nearly 2 dozen measles cases, a spokesman from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) told numerous news outlets today [31 Jan 2017] that the outbreak "has largely been limited to unvaccinated people in a single social group."

Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, MD, MPH, added, "There have been no infections spreading in the general community." He also noted that none of the infected individuals were able to show proof of vaccination, despite strict California laws that require everyone to be vaccinated regardless of personal and religious beliefs. However, all of the cases reviewed by the LACDPH were individuals older than 12 years of age who would not necessarily have been affected by the new law. Perhaps even more troubling is the idea that children who had not been vaccinated in the fall of 2015 for kindergarten may have, in some instances, continued on to 1st grade in the fall of 2016 without meeting vaccination requirements due to the timing of the vaccine schedules.

The 1st cases of measles were diagnosed and reported in early December 2016. The LACDPH does not disclose information pertaining to locations of potential measles exposure unless they deem the information to be necessary in reaching individuals who have potentially been exposed. However, the department has been working to notify organizations and family members who may have been exposed to the infection. In the recent LA outbreak, Dr. Gunzenhauser said, "At least 15 of the LA County patients [diagnosed as of 24 Jan 2017] either knew one another or had clear social connections."

He added that residents of Los Angeles County who have not yet been immunized can still protect themselves by receiving the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) as soon as they can. He continued, "2 doses of MMR [are] highly effective in preventing measles and [are] the best way to prevent disease."

As of 26 Jan 2017, Ventura County had also reported a total of 5 confirmed cases, although the county's public health officer, Robert Levin, MD, told local news outlets, "My gut tells me we're on the downslope of this." Four of the 5 Ventura cases were in the same household.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the majority of people who contract measles are unvaccinated. According to CDC researchers, from 2 Jan 2016 to 31 Dec 2016, 70 people from 16 states, including California, were reported to have measles. California recently experienced a large outbreak in 2015 stemming from exposure at Disney theme parks from 17-20 Dec 2014. A team of researchers headed by Jennifer Zipprich, PhD, of the California Department of Public Health reviewed the outbreak during the event and learned that about half of the patients who developed infections were unvaccinated either due to being too young or because of personal beliefs. 15 cases in other states were linked to the outbreak as well.

By the time the outbreak was declared over, 145 people had been infected in the United States, and the state legislature had set the wheels in motion to pass California SB277, which requires all children to be vaccinated regardless of parents' preference or personal beliefs before entering public schools, daycare centers, or private schools. Although the CDC was able to declare measles "eliminated" from the United States in 2000, since there were no reported cases of transmission since a year prior, the rate of unvaccinated populations has rendered that classification largely moot.

Peter J. Hotez, MD, PhD, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, warned that the "anti-vaxxer movement" presence in local communities could lead to increasing numbers of unvaccinated children in schools. "We might soon see a return of measles outbreaks," he warned in a perspective piece published in PLOS Medicine.

California isn't the only state that has been hit by measles. A couple of cases have been popping up in New Jersey recently as well. In Passaic County, an unvaccinated 7-month-old infant who had traveled outside of the country has been confirmed to have measles. In addition, an adult male in Hudson County who had also traveled abroad has been confirmed to have the infection. Due to the fact that measles is so contagious, infections can easily result in outbreaks; the CDC implores parents to keep up-to-date on their own MMR vaccinations and to get their children vaccinated as well.

Two children perished on Sat 27 Jan 2017 in the latest outbreak of measles in Chaman. Hundreds of others are reported to have been affected.

According to the reports, one [child] died of measles in Mehmoodabad settlement of the Chaman Tehsil while another girl, 3, also lost the battle of her life to what is an otherwise curable disease. When contacted, the health authorities said they have dispatched medical teams to the affected areas. The deputy commissioner of Killa Abdullah also paid a visit to the affected area and assured residents that the health department would provide all required medical assistance to them.

http://tribune.com.pk/story/1311802/measles-outbreak-ghotki-claims-one-life/


So far, only one casualty has been reported from Jhando Sanghar village: 4-year-old RS.

The medical superintendent of Taluka Hospital, Ghotki, Dr Lutufullah, told The Express Tribune that the severity of the disease has been reduced during the last week. Earlier, 10 to 12 children were brought to the hospital's outpatient department, out of which we would admit 2-3, he said. "Most people prefer to take their children to private hospitals and clinics instead of government hospitals," he explained.

Dr Pribh Das, who runs a private hospital in Ghotki, said that the measles outbreak has been continuing for the last 2 months. 8-10 children are brought to his hospital every day, and so far only one casualty has been reported. "The severity of the virus is much less than in 2013, when hundreds of children lost their lives," he claimed.

According to him, measles takes 7 days to subside, and it is important to provide proper nutrition to the patient. "It is a common practice in rural Sindh that people stop giving any food and even water to the infected child, due to which their immune system becomes weaker," he explained.

[It is not clear why disease severity this year [2017] is significantly less than seen in 2013, but that is a good sign. Perhaps case management has improved, or vaccine coverage. Climatic factors also may have contributed to damaged hospitals and clinics in 2013, compromising health care.

Pakistan has a poor health care system, unsanitary conditions in many regions due to poverty, and a lack of education about how to prevent disease. Pakistani officials believe that the worst-hit areas in 2013 were poverty stricken areas where children did not receive vaccination.

Many Pakistanis, especially in rural areas, view vaccination campaigns with suspicion as a western plot to sterilise Muslims. Furthermore, Sindh province, the area hardest hit by the measles outbreak [in 2013], was battered by repeated floods that damaged hospitals and clinics. This may have contributed to the poor recovery observed that year (excerpted from http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2013/01/20131282648859762.html).

Romania saw 15 measles cases in 2015. Since 2016, this number has risen up to 2165, including 13 fatalities. This is largely due to bogus claims from anti-vaccination campaigns in the country, according to a La Vanguardia report (computer translated).

President of the Romanian Society of Microbiology Alexandru Rafila directly points the finger at the anti-vaxx movement and says, "Incorrect information, often tendentious, not based on scientific methods or real data, should end so that they do not affect the health of our children."

Mercury in vaccines, vaccines introducing foreign elements, and vaccines causing asthma are some of the arguments made by the anti-vaccination movement. This misinformation has resulted in vaccination rates in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine falling from 95% of children in 2013 to 80% in 2016, and it continues to drop.

Campaigns led by the Christian Orthodox Pro Vita Federation, author of the 2012 book "Vaccines: Prevention or Illness," Christei Todea-Gross, and the Coalition for the Family have spread the anti-vaccination message through a number of outlets.

The Ministry of Health has been denouncing "the irresponsible campaigns against the vaccination of children" for months; however, there are many parents who do not vaccinate their children for lack of confidence towards the authorities.

Measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus. In 1980, before widespread vaccination, measles caused an estimated 2.6 million deaths each year. The key facts regarding measles are:

- Measles is one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available.
- In 2015, there were 134 200 measles deaths globally, about 367 deaths every day or 15 deaths every hour.
- Measles vaccination resulted in a 79% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2015 worldwide.
- In 2015, about 85% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their 1st birthday through routine health services, up from 73% in 2000.
- During 2000-2015, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.3 million deaths, making measles vaccine one of the best buys in public health.
