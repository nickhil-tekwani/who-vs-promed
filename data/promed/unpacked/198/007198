Rare rabies death recorded
--------------------------
A Mexican migrant worker suffering from rabies died Sunday [22 Aug
2010] in New Orleans, a state Department of Health and Hospitals
(DHH) spokesman said today [24 Aug 2010].

As a matter of policy, the state will not release the man's name,
said Ken Pastorick, public information officer with DHH [Department
of Health and Hospitals].

The man arrived in the United States 28 Jul 2010 and began showing
flu-like symptoms 2 Aug 2010, Pastorick said.

On 3 Aug 2010, he arrived at Pointe Coupee General Hospital in New
Roads, hospital administrator Chad Olinde said. The same day, the man
was transferred to University Hospital in New Orleans, where he
remained until his death, Pastorick said.

"This was a very rare rabies death," Pastorick said. An investigation
into the man's death shows he contracted the disease in Mexico, he said.

State officials are investigating whether the man's coworkers,
hospital staff, or others were potentially exposed to the virus,
although human-to-human rabies transfers are very rare, he said.

Louisiana reports 1st human rabies death in 60 years
----------------------------------------------------
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH) said a
Hispanic field worker died over the weekend [21-22 Aug 2010] of rabies.

The victim was initially taken to a hospital in New Roads and
transferred to New Orleans, where he later died.

Lisa Faust with DHH confirmed the case is the 1st human death in
Louisiana attributed to rabies in more than 60 years.

The department reported it has contacted the victim's co-workers and
tested them. Health officials are continuing to follow up on their treatment.

DHH added the man, who is unidentified at this time, contacted rabies
in Mexico and brought it to the US.

Disease experts with the CDC report all mammals are susceptible to
rabies, but only a few species are important as reservoirs for the disease.

In the US, distinct strains of rabies virus have been identified in
raccoons, skunks, foxes, and coyotes. Several species of bats are
also reservoirs for strains of the rabies virus.

Transmission of rabies virus usually begins when infected saliva of a
host is passed to an uninfected animal. The most common mode of
rabies virus transmission is through the bite and virus-containing
saliva of an infected host.

[Early symptoms of rabies may include irritability, headache, fever,
and itching or pain at the exposure site. The disease eventually
progresses to spasms of the throat and the muscles used for
breathing, convulsions, delirium, paralysis, and death. It is
important to note that by the time any symptoms appear, rabies cannot
be successfully treated.

Because of the spasms in the throat and neck, the disease has,
historically, been dubbed hydrophobia, or fear of water. The person
or animal affected by rabies does not have fear of water, as they are
thirsty, but because of the spasms in the throat they are unable to drink.

The time between exposure and the onset of symptoms is variable but
averages 2 to 12 weeks in humans. Incubation periods of over 1 year
have been reported.

Person to person transmission is extremely rare, however, precautions
should be taken to prevent exposure to the saliva of the diseased
person. Tissues from individuals with rabies must not be used in
transplant procedures.
