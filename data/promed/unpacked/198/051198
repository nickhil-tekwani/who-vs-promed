Scrub typhus is an infectious disease caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a mite-borne bacterium.

A 38-year-old woman on Sunday [12 Jun 2022] died at the government medical college hospital here [Thiruvananthapuram] due to scrub typhus, the 2nd death due to the disease in the last 3 days. The Thiruvananthapuram native who died this morning [12 Jun 2022] was admitted on 10 Jun 2022, hospital authorities told PTI. "She was brought here on 10 Jun 2022 but died early this morning. As of now, we don't have any similar case," a senior hospital source told PTI.

The 15-year-old, a native of Cherunniyoor [Thiruvananthapuram district in the state of Kerala], a hamlet located over 40 km [about 25 mi] away from here had died on June 9 [2022] due to the disease that is known as 'chellu pani' in local parlance.

[Scrub typhus is caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a rickettsia-like microorganism that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites, which feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults and feed only on plant materials. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ in nature (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Endemic regions for scrub typhus extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and the Indian subcontinent, and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5687757/).

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; regional lymphadenopathy occurs at the site of the bite and may lead to generalized lymphadenopathy (https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/231374-clinical).

Other than the necrotic skin lesion at the site of mite inoculation (the eschar), scrub typhus has no distinctive clinical features to make an accurate clinical diagnosis and the presence of an eschar in patients has been reported to vary widely. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, but we are not told in the news report above how the diagnosis was made in these patients from Kerala.

The Weil-Felix test is commonly used to make the diagnosis of rickettsial infections, including scrub typhus, in resource-limited areas where more current diagnostic methods are not available (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination reaction based on the fact that certain serotypes of _Proteus_ bacteria display antigenic cross-reactivity with _Rickettsia_ species. This test has largely been replaced due to its low sensitivity and specificity with new serological techniques. For example, false positive results have been seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients with the Weil-Felix test (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trstmh.2008.11.020).

The gold standard for diagnosis of rickettsial infections is indirect immunofluorescent IgG antibody assays of paired serum samples (one taken during the acute phase of the disease and one taken 2 to 4 weeks later in the convalescent phase) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559225/). Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region like India. Having an accurate, available, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic test for scrub typhus would be important to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892940/#abstract-2title).

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline in both adults and children (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html); doxycycline is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (https://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/doxycycline/index.html). Treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting results of laboratory confirmation. - Mod.ML
