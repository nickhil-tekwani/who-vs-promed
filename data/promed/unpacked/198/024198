About 17 per cent of cocoa farms have been affected by the cocoa swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD), thus threatening production. The figure represents more than 315 000 hectares [778 382 acres] of the 1.6 million hectares [about 4 million acres] of the country's entire cocoa farms. Per COCOBOD [Ghana Cocoa Board] estimate, a hectare contains 900 trees and by this, 283 500 000 of cocoa trees in the country are affected.

CSSVD broke out in the country in 1936. COCOBOD said the country had been experiencing dwindling cocoa production after 2010/11, when it produced one million metric tonnes of cocoa. Due to CSSVD, production declined to 811 000 metric tonnes in the 2018/19 crop season.

To reverse the threat of the CSSVD, COCOBOD over the years had initiated programmes to combat the disease [and] had currently completed a pilot project in the Western North and Eastern regions, to extend to other regions, such as Volta, Ashanti, Central, and Western North regions. About 2000 hectares [4942 acres] of cocoa farms had been replanted in the 2 regions.

30 hectares [74 acres] of irrigated seed gardens [have been established] to ensure constant supply of hybrid cocoa seedlings to farmers whose farms have been cut down due to the CSSVD. A campaign to educate farmers on the need to cut down their CSSVD-affected cocoa farms and replant [is being conducted].

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa (CSSD) caused by species of genus _Badnavirus_ can lead to severe crop losses. The viruses are thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viruses or strains and may include leaf banding; severe effects on shoots and roots resulting in serious dieback or even death of the tree; or no symptoms at all. The viruses are spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Transmission with pollen and via true seed is considered unlikely, but spread on seed surfaces cannot be excluded so far.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control and native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Keeping replanted trees from becoming reinfected would be challenging under local conditions, thus ongoing breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties (as mentioned above) are crucial. Cross protection against severe viral strains by mild strains is also being trialled (see link below).

A westward spread of CSSD in Ghana led to a serious outbreak with more severe symptoms in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) and the possibility of the involvement of a new viral strain was considered. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria and Ivory Coast signed an agreement to tackle the disease and subsequently molecular work has increased. The 3 badnaviruses currently recognised as cause of the disease are _Cacao swollen shoot virus_, _Cacao swollen shoot CD virus_, and _Cacao swollen shoot Togo A virus_. Additional proposed species Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) and Cacao red vein-banding virus (CRVBV) were isolated from field samples (ProMED-mail post 20171025.5404488 and links below). CRVV is suspected to be the causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype of CSSD.

Additional virus sequences were constructed by _in silico_ analysis of symptomatic field samples collected in West Africa (ProMED-mail post 20180409.5734172). Whether these are associated with intact virus particles and thus represent actual infectious viruses involved in CSSD _in vivo_ will need to be verified by pathogenicity and epidemiology studies. Of all currently known CSSD-associated viruses, pathogenicity studies to prove infectivity in the host (according to Koch's Postulates) have so far only been carried out with a single inoculum of cloned CSSV.
