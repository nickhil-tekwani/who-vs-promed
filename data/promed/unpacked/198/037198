Health officials are fanning out through a North Carolina
neighborhood, trying to stop a sudden outbreak of syphilis.

Officials in Forsyth County told the Winston-Salem Journal that the
140 cases of the sexually transmitted disease reported so far this
year [2009] is more than triple the cases reported in all of 2008.
About 125 officials and volunteers are spending Saturday [29 Aug 2009]
walking through a neighborhood where a cluster of cases have been
reported, offering free blood tests for syphilis and HIV. Anyone who
agrees to be tested will get a Wal-Mart gift card.

Local and state health officials will be knocking on doors in Forsyth
County today [29 Aug 2009] to raise awareness of the sharp increase in
the number of syphilis cases this year [2009]. Forsyth leads the state
in new cases of syphilis, according to the epidemiology section of the
NC Department of Health and Human Services.

The number has doubled -- from 70 to 140 infectious cases -- in just
the 3 months since the department reported that there was an outbreak.
There were 46 cases in Forsyth last year [2008] and 31 in 2007. By
comparison, there have been more than 600 new cases statewide this
year [2009] compared with 509 in 2008. "We're at a public-health
crisis with syphilis," Evelyn Foust, the top official for the
communicable disease branch of the NC Division of Public Health, said
yesterday [28 Aug 2009].

About 125 officials and volunteers, wearing royal blue T-shirts
bearing the words POSSE, will be providing free in-home blood tests
for syphilis and HIV from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today [29 Aug 2009]. POSSE
stands for Prevent On-going Spread of STDs Everywhere. Although the
effort will cover the county, the group will focus on neighborhoods
where there has been a cluster of new cases this year [2009].
Residents will be provided with a bag containing educational
information. A Wal-Mart gift card will be given to those people who
agree to be tested.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection spread through sexual contact that
can produce rashes or sores in the groin area. A blood test reveals
whether a person has syphilis. The disease is curable and, at most
stages, typically treated with antibiotics. Left untreated, syphilis
can cause damage to the heart and to the central nervous system. "The
same people who are at risk for syphilis are at risk for HIV," said Dr
Tim Monroe, the director of the health department. "They can contract
both diseases at the same time."

Much of the overall effort in Forsyth is directed at 2 populations
considered most at-risk -- prostitutes and gay and bisexual men.
Officials said they also are emphasizing educating and testing people
between ages 20 and 29.

Monroe said he doesn't know precisely why the number of new cases has
gone up so sharply. "It is likely connected to the frequency of
transmissions within social groups or certain social behaviors, such
as prostitution or selling sex for drugs," Monroe said. The recession
also may be playing a role in the increase, Monroe and Foust said.
"Some people may not use as good a judgment in bad economic times,
engaging in more drinking and drug use that may lead to encounters of
unprotected sex," Foust said.

Doctors are required by law to report syphilis to the local health
department, according to Patrice Toney, the HIV/STI prevention
supervisor for the local department. When people test positive, a
state disease-intervention specialist will contact them and then try
to find as many of their partners as possible and encourage them to
get tested. Depending on how these efforts are received and the status
of the outbreak, state and county officials may consider doing another
outreach effort this year [2009].

[From Mod.ML's comment in ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (NY) 20070814.2650:

"The total number of cases of syphilis (primary, secondary, and
tertiary) reported annually in the United States declined dramatically
in the 1940's to a low in 2000. As the rate of primary and secondary
(infectious) syphilis (a better indicator of disease activity)
decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of
changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike occurred in the late
1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital
syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and
exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990
to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the
United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since
reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary
syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of
increases in cases among men who have sex with men
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm>)."

The causes of the current outbreak in Winston-Salem are at the present
time speculative and require a detailed epidemiologic investigation.
Winston-Salem is the county seat and largest city of Forsyth County,
North Carolina and the fourth-largest city in the state
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston-Salem,_North_Carolina>). As of
the 2000 census, the city's population was 185 776, with a total urban
population of 299 290. Corporate headquarters of the RJ Reynolds
Tobacco Company, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, and until 2001, Wachovia
Bank, are located in Winston-Salem, as is Wake-Forest University.
