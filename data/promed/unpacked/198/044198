The Chinese Ministry of Health is conducting its own investigation into the
report of a man who died of H5N1 avian influenza in late 2003, according to
a report today by Agence France-Presse (AFP).
The case was first described by 8 Chinese researchers in the Jun 22 issue of
the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) [see: Avian influenza, human (88)
- China, Indonesia 20060622.172]. The Chinese Ministry of Health said it was
conducting its own tests to try to confirm the case, Roy Wadia, World Health
Organization (WHO) spokesman in China, told AFP. The date given for the
case, November 2003, was 2 years before China officially reported any human
H5N1 cases to the WHO.
The Ministry of Health said it was unaware of the case until the
researchers' report appeared in NEJM, Wadia told AFP. He said the WHO has
asked the Health Ministry to determine where the man caught the H5N1 virus
and whether there were other deaths. He also said it was unclear why the
scientists, who work at state institutions, did not report their findings to
the Health Ministry. Adding to confusion about the case, the NEJM reported
last week that the authors had emailed the journal requesting that the
report be withdrawn, but the request was too late. Karen Pederson, NEJM
spokeswoman, told CIDRAP News today that the journal then asked the
researchers to explain the rationale for their withdrawal request. The
journal took the withdrawal request seriously, Pederson said, because one of
the email messages requesting withdrawal came from the real address of one
of the researchers. She said the authors responded that they stood by their
report and none of them said they had emailed a request to withdraw it.
In the AFP article, Wadia declined to speculate about a cover-up by the
Chinese government. "We are just waiting for further information as to when
exactly it was confirmed and why was it not conveyed to the Ministry of
Health," Wadia told AFP. The November 2003 death of a 24 year old Beijing
man attributed last week to avian influenza was originally thought to be
from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), according to the authors of
the NEJM report. The case is significant because, if confirmed, it revises
the timeline and geographic pattern of human cases of avian flu (see link to
Jun 22 CIDRAP News story below).

Zhu Q-Y, Qin E-D, Wang W, et al. Fatal infection with influenza A (H5N1)
virus in China (letter). N Engl J Med 2006; 354: 2731-2.
It is perhaps not surprising that a human case (or cases) of H5N1 avian
influenza was not recognised in 2003 when the concern was containment of the
novel SARS-associated virus. However, clarification of the situation is
urgently required to determine when and where the first detection of human
H5N1 avian influenza virus infection occurred in mainland China. - Mod.CP]
