CYCLOSPORA - US (NEW YORK CITY) AND CANADA (ONTARIO)
====================================================
Date: Fri, 30 May 1997
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>
Source: Sun-Sentinel, Fort Lauderdale, Florida

According to a report in today's Fort Lauderdale (FL) Sun-Sentinel, two more
outbreaks of cyclospora have occurred, one in New York City and one in
Ontario, bringing the total number of cases in 1997 to more than 400. The
new events have, for the time being, been linked to berries, including
raspberries from Guatemala. The CDC was scheduled to meet with FDA
officials and the Guatemalan Berry Commission. Last year, cyclospora
infected strawberries were traced to that Central American country.
Guatemalan raspberries have been positively identified as the
source of the illness in only one of the 12 outbreaks this year.
[In a related development, a report in today's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine calls for irradiation of vegetables and fruits to guard
against infections, many of which go unrecognized.]
