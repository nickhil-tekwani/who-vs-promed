I would like to share a case of foodborne botulism in one of our insured
expatriates that I think will be of interest. I apologize for the length,
but it is an intriguing story.
The patient is a 35 year old American woman living in Prague who traveled
to the Republic of Georgia for a week business trip. She ate in
restaurants, except for a buffet of finger foods at an event in Batumi. She
became ill a day after return to Prague with a "flu," characterized by
weakness, malaise, and GI symptoms. She returned to work 2 weeks later,
though her weakness had not improved.
4 weeks after the Georgia trip, she experienced diplopia. Over the next 24
hours, she developed balance problems, a change in quality of speech and an
inability to raise her arms. The following day, she was seen at a local
clinic where she was thought to be intoxicated. Over the next 2 days, she
had progressive dyspnea, dysphagia, and garbled speech.
She was then admitted to a major tertiary hospital with an initial
diagnosis of conversion reaction. Electromyography, done twice, lumbar
puncture, and head MRI were normal. She had no history of Botox use. 2 days
later, she was moved to the ICU and placed on a ventilator for respiratory
distress. A tensilon [edrophonium, short-acting anticholinesterase] test
was interpreted as weakly positive, and treatment for myasthenia gravis
with IV IgG was begun. There was no improvement after 5 days. Acetylcholine
receptor antibodies returned negative and interval tensilon tests were
negative. IgG was discontinued. Diagnosis: "extreme hysterical reaction or
some other undiagnosed neurological condition."
She was then evacuated by air ambulance to the National Hospital for
Neurology and Neurosurgery in London, where the provisional diagnosis was
Miller-Fisher syndrome (Guillain-Barre variant). However, the diagnosis
remained uncertain over the next 3 weeks. The diagnosis of foodborne
botulism was eventually established on the basis of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) detection of toxin and fecal culture.
She improved over the next 2 months and has now returned to Prague, where
she continues to recuperate. Health authorities were notified of the case
in Prague and Georgia. No other cases of botulism were found in Prague. I
do not have information about Georgia.
Question: Did the exposure to botulin occur in Georgia or Prague? Her
attending physicians and neurologist feel that it was most likely in
Georgia, which is reported to have the highest per capita rate of botulism
in the world. If so, the initial "flu" was a prodromal stage, and there was
a 30 day evolution to the point of critical paresis. They believe that the
course is compatible based upon the fact that therapeutic botulin (such as
Botox) reaches its full effect 30 days after injection. This is at
variance, though, with standard texts that suggest a much shorter time of
72 hours or less. However, some of the literature I've found is either
vague or silent on the time of onset, suggesting that the interval may not
be well established. I would also take the absence of another case in
Prague, which has a good public health infrastructure, to be supportive of
the theory.
Assuming the disease was contracted in Georgia, here are some metrics for
this case:
Time of onset of prodrome to definitive diagnosis = 64 days
Onset of illness to ICU = 35 days
Time from onset of neurological symptoms to diagnosis = 34 days
Total time on respirator = 46 days
Total time in hospital = 80 days
Number of wrong diagnoses = 5 (flu, intoxication, hysteria, myasthenia,
Miller-fisher (notably, hysteria was entertained even while she was on a
ventilator)).
Take home points:
1. Botulism is a foodborne risk in Georgia and probably other areas of
Eurasia. It should be in the differential for neuromuscular illness in
people traveling in this region.
2. Botulism is probably significantly underreported due to missed diagnoses.
3. The illness may evolve over a much longer period than suggested in
standard texts and literature.
4. Psychological explanations for dramatic neuromuscular presentations,
especially in a middle-aged person with no psychiatric history, should be
avoided, as they foster an atmosphere that may delay treatment.

[The PCR test described is likely to be the detection of the gene for
botulinum toxin, not the toxin itself, and ought to be able to report the
specific toxin type involved here (1). The assay, however, cannot measure
whether the toxin is expressed. The usual toxin assay is a mouse bioassay,
which by neutralization analysis can also indicate the specific toxin involved.
After reading this case report, if the disease was acquired in Georgia, it
is most likely that this was a case of adult colonization botulism, a rare
form parallel to infant botulism. In such cases, spores of the botulinum
bacilli germinate in a gut that, because of inadequate colonization with
normal flora, cannot prevent persistence of vegetative bacilli. In infants,
the intestinal flora have not yet adequately developed. In the adult
variant, the colonization may be facilitated by gastrointestinal surgery,
such as a Billroth procedure for peptic ulcer disease (2) or jejunoileal
bypass (3) or other functional intestinal disease, such as Crohn's disease
(4) or a Meckel's diverticulum (5).
Even if acquired in Prague, a report of 4 cases thought to be adult
colonization botulism (6) showed that toxin and/or _C. botulinum_ can be
found for prolonged times in the stool, as long as 119 days. This is likely
to occur with ingestion of preformed toxin. In a murine model, lyophilized
airborne botulinum spores was found to be able to colonise antimicrobially
pretreated adult mice (7). This observation may be relevant if a biowarfare
situation when widespread antimicrobials are utilized.
