A total of 12 cases of scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bite of an infected mite found in areas with heavy scrub vegetation, have been reported at Lady Willington Hospital Manali, disclosed Dr Philip Alex, Medical superintendent of the Hospital. A total of 12 cases were reported this year [2013], out of which 3 were referred to PGI Chandigarh and [9] others were treated here, said Dr Philips [sic].

Dr Philips said that "Since last year [2012], we have been seeing scrub typhus (presumably) in Manali [Himachal Pradesh state]. Patients present to us with fever, chills, respiratory difficulty, with or without jaundice. They may also have central nervous system symptoms, with confusion and headache". He added that the characteristic eschar alerts us to the possibility of typhus. They invariably have a low platelet count and may also have leucopenia and anemia. The respiratory distress is usually progressive when diagnosed late or when they present to us late. He further disclosed they often need ventilation and are very sick. They may also go into renal failure. The presence of jaundice and altered liver enzymes often compounds the seriousness of the disease. He said an early initiation of doxycycline medication, blood transfusion if appropriate, and steroids with early ventilation saves lives. A 4 percent hospital mortality has been described.

Dr Philips said the [bite of the larval form, called a chigger, of the] trombiculid mite, transmits _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ [the bacterial organism that causes scrub typhus]. The disease can occur a week after being bitten and the eschar by this time is a characteristic central dark necrosed area, often well circumscribed and circular in appearance. [A picture of the eschar is available at the source URL.]

He further disclosed that diagnosis is by the indirect fluorescent antibody test or PCR, or biopsy of the eschar. We have been informed that the Weil Felix test is available in the Kullu zonal hospital. The clinical and laboratory picture is pretty characteristic to allow the early initiation of therapy.

Scrub typhus is becoming a problem both to diagnose and treat in time in Himachal and other areas of North India.

He revealed that the people should take extra care while cutting the grass especially in rainy season and [if] any of the above symptoms appear they should report the matter immediately to the nearest hospital.

[For a discussion of scrub typhus, see moderator ML's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts Scrub typhus - India (07): (RJ) fatal, susp. 20120917.1297397 and Scrub typhus - India (12): (MH) fatal 20121109.1402125.

Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are up to 30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf).

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Because of the relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of this test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including complement fixation. The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. Dipstick assays (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479551) have been developed that are easy to perform and do not require sophisticated equipment, making them suitable for use in rural areas where more sophisticated diagnostic tests such as the IFA may not be available.

Manali is a small hill station [towns formerly frequented by European colonials as refuges from the summer heat] in the mountains at an altitude of 2050 meters (6726 feet) of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh near the northern end of the Kullu Valley (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manali,_Himachal_Pradesh). It is located about 270 km (168 miles) north of the state capital, Shimla (aka Simla).
