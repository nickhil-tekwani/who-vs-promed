[The southwestern province of Jazan and the contiguous Asir region of Saudi
Arabia are where the first and largest number of human cases of Rift Valley
fever in Saudi Arabia have been reported. The numbers of cases and deaths
have been gradually declining since mid-October (i.e., approximately 4
weeks after diagnosis and confirmation of Rift Valley fever in the
Kingdom). Unless there is a dramatic escalation of the outbreak, future
updates will only appear periodically. - Mod.CP
