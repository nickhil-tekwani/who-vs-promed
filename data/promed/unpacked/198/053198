Egyptian Agriculture Minister Ezz Eddin Abo Setit said that his ministry is investigating a crisis caused by imported tomato seeds which are infected with leaf curl virus. The company that imported the seeds had obtained prior approval from the ministry's Committee for the Examination and Certification of Seeds [but] the Committee did not analyze samples of 19 lots imported, relying instead on the certificate previously approved.

The ministry is currently verifying the infection in several governorates [and] is examining a sample of the seeds, to confirm whether it is infected with the leaf curl virus. A total of 331 kg [730 lb] seeds were imported from 4 different countries: Brazil, Thailand, China and Laos.

[The common name 'leaf curl virus' is generally being used for any species belonging to the tomato leaf curl or yellow leaf curl clades of the genus _Begomovirus_. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous, cucurbit, and other crops and can lead to considerable yield losses. Symptoms may include distortion and yellowing of leaves and stems, stunting of plants, reduced flowering, and severe loss of plant vigour. A large number of geographical variants of the viruses are being identified and many of them have now been classified as separate species. Frequent recombination events are considered to be the basis for the diversity within the clades. Variations in host range and specificity exist both amongst viral species and between different strains within species.

Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes). Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. Many begomoviruses can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but seed transmission was considered absent for this group. However, recent work has indicated likely seed transmission of _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV) in tomato and some other hosts (see links below).

Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available. In some areas, leaf curl viruses are considered to be the biggest constraint to solanaceous and cucurbit crops, both in terms of yield losses (up to 100 per cent in tomato) and loss of fruit quality.

The Mediterranean region has been identified as a 'hot spot' for emergence of new strains and species within the leaf curl/yellow leaf curl clades. For the situation above, it would need to be investigated whether the imported seed really was the source of the incursion, or whether the imported tomato varieties showed a high sensitivity to a local virus strain. But in any case, a failure to test any imported seed would constitute a high risk of pathogen incursions.
