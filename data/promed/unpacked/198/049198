Barber Foods is recalling more than 1.7 million pounds of frozen, stuffed chicken products that may be contaminated with _Salmonella_. The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) says at least 6 people in Minnesota and Wisconsin got sick after eating the products between April 2015 and late June 2015. The recall was 1st announced on 2 Jul 2015 and initially involved about 58 000 pounds of Barber Foods chicken products; the recall is now being expanded after more cases of illness were reported.

The recall involves frozen, stuffed, raw chicken packaged in 6 individual pouches per box in varieties including Chicken Kiev, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Tenders and Chicken Broccoli Cheese. A complete list is posted on the USDA's website. The products were manufactured between 17 Feb 2015-20 May 2015, and were sold at supermarkets across the USA and Canada. Recalled packages have a use by/sell by date of 28 Apr 2016, 20 May 2016, or 21 Jul 2016, and a Lot Code number 0950292102, 0950512101, or 0951132202.

The USDA warned consumers that raw chicken must be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination of other foods, kitchen surfaces and utensils. Cooking chicken thoroughly to a temperature of 165 F [74 C] should kill _Salmonella_.

[In preparing frozen raw breaded chicken products, there are precautions you should take to protect your health:
- wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water before and after handling raw poultry products;
- use a separate plate, cutting board, and utensils when handling raw poultry products to prevent the spread of harmful bacteria;
- frozen raw breaded chicken products may appear to be pre-cooked or browned, but some contain raw chicken and should be handled and prepared no differently than raw poultry products;
- do not eat raw or undercooked poultry products. Cook all frozen, stuffed, breaded, or raw poultry products to an internal temperature of at least 74 C (165 F) to ensure they are safe to eat. Whole poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 82 C (180 F);
- due to uneven heating, microwave cooking of frozen raw breaded poultry products including chicken nuggets, strips, or burgers is not recommended;
- always follow package cooking instructions, including products labeled Uncooked, Cook and Serve, Ready to Cook, and Oven Ready.
