Students warned over mumps cases
--------------------------------
The MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] triple vaccine protects against
measles, mumps, and rubella virus infection. Students are being warned to
protect themselves against mumps after a surge in the number of cases.
There have been 315 confirmed infections in Greater Manchester this year
compared with 36 in 2008. Across Cumbria and Lancashire the number rose
from 97 to 341 confirmed cases and in Merseyside and Cheshire the numbers
rose to 304 from 111. People aged under 25 are being urged to have the MMR
vaccine before they return to college after the Christmas holiday. Leaflets
and posters about mumps have been put up in universities and colleges.

Professor Qutub Syed, from the Health Protection Agency, said: "We have
seen a sharp rise in the figures this year [2009] and teenagers and young
adults who have not had 2 doses of MMR vaccine are particularly vulnerable.
There is evidence in parts of the region that the disease is spreading in
student populations. That is why we are working closely with the
universities and colleges to inform students about mumps and to explain why
vaccination is important."

The usual symptoms for mumps are a painful inflammation and swelling of the
glands under one or both sides of the jaw, fever, and headache. Some people
suffer complications that can include inflammation of the pancreas; viral
meningitis (inflammation of the brain); inflamed and swollen testicles in
men and ovaries in women. Mumps can also cause deafness.

[Remarkably the current surge in cases of mumps seems to be country-wide
and presumably affects predominantly the new intake of students into
institutions of higher education. This phenomenon is likely to be
consequence of the continuing suboptimal uptake of MMR vaccine throughout
the United Kingdom.
