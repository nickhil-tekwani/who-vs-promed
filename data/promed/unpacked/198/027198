Another 3 [US] states and a city in Japan may have tainted seaweed from Hawaii, according to the FDA on [Mon 14 Nov 2016]. Marine Agrifuture, LLC. of Kahuku, Hawaii, is recalling its Kahuku Ogo, Robusta Ogo, and Kahuku Sea Asparagus because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail, or elderly people and others with weakened immune systems.

The recalled seaweed were distributed mainly in Hawaii to seafood and produce distributors through direct delivery, but also to some customers in California, Washington, Nevada [USA], Tokyo [Japan], and retailed at local farmers markets in Hawaii.

[To date, 14 cases of _Salmonella_ have been reported on Oahu in connection with this problem.]

The potential for contamination was noted after special tests by the Hawaii Department of Health revealed the presence of salmonellae in saltwater in the farm production and processing areas. Production of the product has been suspended while FDA and the company continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.

Marine Agrifuture, LLC. of Kahuku, HI, is recalling its "Kahuku Ogo", "Robusta Ogo" and "Kahuku Sea Asparagus" because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail, or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with _Salmonella_ often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with _Salmonella_ can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (that is, infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.

The recalled "Kahuku Ogo", "Robusta Ogo", and "Kahuku Sea Asparagus" were distributed mainly in Hawaii to Seafood and Produce Distributors through direct delivery, but also to some customers in [California, Washington, Nevada], and Tokyo Japan, and retailed at local Farmers Markets in Hawaii.

The Ogo products come in a plastic bag of various weights from 0.5 lb to 35 lb, which were sold from 2 Nov 2016 and prior, and the Sea Asparagus in 4 oz, 1 lb clear plastic clamshell or in a 5 lb of plastic bag marked with a tracking number stamped on the lids or bags, which were sold from 8 Nov 2016 and prior. The corresponding UPC number for 4 oz, 1 lb, and 5 lb of sea asparagus are 897680001010, 897680001027, and 897680001041 respectively.

[To date, 14 cases of _Salmonella_ have been reported on Oahu in connection with this problem.] The potential for contamination was noted after special tests by the Hawaii Department of Health revealed the presence of the organism in saltwater in the farm production and processing areas. Production of the product has been suspended while FDA and the company continue their investigation as to what caused the problem.

Seafood and Produce companies that have purchased Kahuku Ogo, Robusta Ogo, and Kahuku Sea Asparagus described above are urged to stop using or selling or further distributing these products, to disposal of the products, and to have them let us know the amount that was destroyed for credit and reconciliation for your recall. Consumers who have purchased 1 lb or 0.5 lb package of Kahuku Ogo, Robusta Ogo, and 4 oz package of Kahuku Sea Asparagus at Farmers Markets are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund.
