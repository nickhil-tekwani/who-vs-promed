Following the deaths of 3 people, including a couple from Maryville [Tennessee ], Sandals Emerald Bay [Bahamas] resort officials have placed carbon monoxide detectors in all guest rooms.

[MP], 68, and [RP], 65, from East Tennessee, died from carbon monoxide poisoning in a villa at Sandals Emerald Bay resort on Exuma Island earlier this month [May 2022], according to reports. The couple were married for 43 years and owned a travel agency, Royal Travel, in Maryville.

This couple accounted for 2 of the 3 people found dead after getting sick on the island in the Bahamas on 6 May 2022.

The couple complained of nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms on the night of 5 May 2022, and were treated at a local medical facility, according to Bahamas Health Minister Dr Michael Darville.

The following day both were found dead in their hotel room. According to CBS, [MP] was found slumped against a wall while [RP] was on their bed, both showing signs of convulsion.

[DC and VPC], who were visiting from Florida, stayed in a separate villa near the [Tennessee] couple. [VPC] was also found dead while his wife was airlifted to a Florida hospital in serious condition, according to [Bahamas Police Commissioner Paul Rolle].

A resort spokesperson told WVLT News that based on an investigation, Bahamian authorities concluded the cause was an isolated incident in one standalone structure housing 2 guest rooms. They also said it was not linked to the resort's air conditioning system, food and beverage service, landscaping services, or foul play.

Since the tragedy, Sandals Emerald Bay officials said they had taken additional measures to ensure the safety and well-being of visiting guests and team members, such as ensuring safety experts conduct a comprehensive review of all systems among the resort.

As a result of the deaths, an official of the resort said carbon monoxide detectors had been placed in all guest rooms at Sandals Emerald Bay. Although not mandated, they said detectors have also been installed in all of its Caribbean destinations. "We wish to once again extend our deepest sympathies and our heartfelt condolences to the [families]," the official said. "Our entire team is keeping the families in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.

The [Tennessee] couple were survived by their 3 children and 6 grandchildren, according to their obituaries.

[Sandals Resort statement]
--------------------------
We remain devastated by the unimaginable event that occurred at Sandals Emerald Bay Resort earlier this month [May 2022] that resulted in the loss of 3 lives, including 2 members of our beloved travel advisor community, and the recovery of a 4th guest. We wish to once again extend our deepest sympathies and our heartfelt condolences to the [families].

Despite initial speculation, Bahamian authorities have concluded the cause was an isolated incident in one standalone structure that housed 2 individual guest rooms and was in no way linked to the resort's air conditioning system, food and beverage service, landscaping services, or foul play.

Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our guests and team members is and will always be paramount. It is for this reason that we have taken additional measures such as engaging environmental safety experts for a comprehensive review of all systems across the resort. In addition, CO detectors have now been placed in all guest rooms at Sandals Emerald Bay and although not mandated in any Caribbean destination where we operate, detectors will be installed in all guest rooms throughout the portfolio.

Our entire team is keeping the families in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.

[Carbon monoxide detectors are being required by various states within the United States and in some other countries. Carbon monoxide detectors have become standard in some multi-unit dwellings, including hotels, even in the absence of state/region/country mandated requirements.

Carbon monoxide is invisible, odorless, and tasteless but unfortunately lethal in many cases. Consequently, the detectors are exceptionally helpful in preserving life.

Hopefully, other hotels and resorts in the lovely Caribbean areas will also install carbon monoxide detectors. - Mod.TG
