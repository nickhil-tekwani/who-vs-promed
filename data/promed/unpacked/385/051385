A fungus called _Cryptococcus gattii_ has afflicted a handful of
Oregonians in recent years. Most recently, the fungus sickened a
Junction City woman, who was hospitalized for more than 4 months this
fall [2007] as doctors struggled to make her well.
The epicenter for the organism in the Northwest is Vancouver Island
[Canada], where it was first detected in 1999. Since then, the fungus
has sickened about 180 British Columbians and killed 8, said Karen
Bartlett, associate professor of environmental health at the
University of British Columbia.
The disease caused by the fungus is still extremely rare, but the
rate in British Columbia is 36 cases per one million [of] population
-- far higher than other parts of the world where the fungus exists.
About 25 people get sick each year in British Columbia from the
fungus, and one dies, according to the BC Centre for Disease Control.
Before it was detected on Vancouver Island, the fungus was associated
with tropical and subtropical climates such as those in Australia, New
Zealand,
India, Africa, and South America. Scientists are trying to figure out
why and how _Cryptococcus gattii_ emerged over the past decade in the
Pacific Northwest.
One theory suggests that the microscopic, yeast-like fungus only
recently arrived in the Northwest from the tropics, where it's long
been established, Bartlett said. Perhaps it stowed away on a tropical
plant imported to Canada or was carried by migrating birds.
A competing theory holds that the fungus has been here for a long
time, unnoticed until changes in climate or land use patterns allowed
it to grow in high enough concentrations that it became airborne and
available for causing disease in humans and animals, she said.
Because the fungus has been detected in such a large region, from
Vancouver Island to Oregon, some scientists suspect that global
warming has enabled the fungus to "establish a stable ecological
niche for itself" in the Northwest, she said.
Even small changes in climate, such as an increase in temperature of
a degree or 2, can cause changes to microscopic organisms that are in
dynamic balance with one another, she said. "When the ecology
changes, those changes work their way up and they affect higher
animals or humans," she said.
Once the fungus is established in soil or in trees, it can get
stirred up and float in the air in dry weather, she said. Humans
breathe in the fungus, where it can cause either an infection in the
lungs, or more seriously, in the central nervous system, causing
fungal meningitis. Symptoms include severe cough and shortness of
breath, often accompanied by chills, night sweats, and anorexia,
according to an article published in January [2008] in The Journal of
Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Until 2004, the only human cases of _Cryptococcus gattii_ in Canada
were found among people who lived in or had traveled to Vancouver
Island. The fungus also was found in animals, including porpoises and
household pets such as dogs and cats.
In 2004, when the 1st case was found in someone who had never been to
the island, researchers decided to begin looking farther afield. They
found 3 cases in British Columbia and 2 in Oregon among people who
did not travel to Vancouver Island. One of the Oregon cases lived
near Portland; the other near Eugene, according to the article.
The Portland case involved an 87-year-old man who died from fungal
meningitis in December 2005. The Eugene case involved a 59-year-old
man who suffered from cough, shortness of breath, fever, chills,
weight loss, nausea, and muscle pain in December 2004. The man had
undergone a kidney transplant in September 2003 and reported scarring
of lung tissue as a result of his occupation.
Scientists went looking for the fungus in Oregon's environment. They
took 197 samples of air, soil, water, trees, and other structures,
all of which came back negative." They did not find it in the
environment in Oregon, but it kind of has to be here because these
cases did not travel to Vancouver Island," said Dr Paul Cieslak,
manager of the communicable diseases program in the state Public
Health Division. "We don't know how long it's been here."
The researchers said they don't know whether the samples found
outside Vancouver Island means the fungus has colonized other areas,
or whether they just represented transient dispersal of the fungus.
The fungus poses a challenge for doctors who aren't used to seeing
it, Bartlett said. "The initial symptoms of the disease are not very
specific," she said -- flu-like symptoms and a general malaise.
"Only when the symptoms continue for several weeks or get worse -- a
cough that doesn't go away, unexplained weight loss, night sweats --
do physicians realize they're dealing with something other than
normal flu," she said.
Further confounding matters is that the disease has a long incubation
period: illness occurs 6 to 9 months after exposure to the fungus.
Once doctors figure out what it is, the disease is "very treatable"
in most cases through antifungal medication. But if the disease gets
into the central nervous system, as happened to the Junction City
woman, it is harder to treat.
Last summer [2007], the woman showed up at Sacred Heart Medical
Center's emergency department with symptoms of meningitis, said Dr
Robert Pelz, an infectious disease specialist. She was treated for
bacterial meningitis, but wasn't getting better. It wasn't until lab
tests came back a week or so later that Pelz's partner, Dr Robert
Barnes, figured out that she had fungal meningitis.
What makes the case unusual is that the woman did not have a
compromised immune system. Doctors are familiar with a more common
type of the fungus, called _Cryptococcus neoformans_, which is known
to attack people with compromised immune systems, including people
with HIV.
Doctors don't know how or where she picked up the fungal infection,
Pelz said. They thought she might have been exposed when she walked
at Finley National Wildlife Refuge near Corvallis, but state
epidemiologists who went to the area and tested tree bark for the
fungus found nothing, he said.
She spent 2 weeks in the hospital in July [2007], and 2 weeks in
August, and was readmitted on 5 September. All told, she spent about
4 months in the hospital, including stints in the intensive care unit
and 7 weeks at Oregon Health & Science University.
"The longer she goes without improving, you start to become concerned
about how it's going to turn out," Pelz said.
She came home 10 Dec [2007], and has gained about 15 pounds (7 kg),
her husband said. "She's going gangbusters," he said. She declined to
be interviewed. He described her ordeal fighting "this weird disease
from who knows where" as "almost surreal."
From a public health perspective, _Cryptococcus gattii_ is more "a
curiosity" than a real threat at this point, said Cieslak, the state
public health official. That said, Cieslak said he wants to learn as
much as he can about the fungus, where it is in Oregon and how it
works. "You've got bigger things to worry about," he said. "If we
start to get more reports and it's increasing, I'll sit up and take
note."
Pelz said while _Cryptococcus gattii_ is still "awfully rare," it
does cause him concern. "It is a new infection, and it's making its
way south," he said.

Q: What is _Cryptococcus gattii_?
A: _Cryptococcus gattii_ is a microscopic yeast-like fungus that is
found naturally in the environment of British Columbia, Canada and in
other areas around the world, particularly in areas with warm or
tropical climates.
Q: Does _Cryptococcus gattii_ have other names?
A: Recent research has led to the scientific reclassification of
_Cryptococcus gattii_ to species status, where previously it was
considered to be a variety of the species _Cryptococcus neoformans_.
This type of reclassification is likely to take some time to become
universally accepted, and some people, publications, or websites may
also refer to the fungus as _Cryptococcus neoformans_ variety
_gattii_, _Cryptococcus neoformans_, _Cryptococcus_, or serotype B.
_Cryptococcus gattii_ is considered to be the correct name for the
fungus causing infection in British Columbia.
Q: Is _Cryptococcus gattii_ dangerous to my health?
A: Exposure to _Cryptococcus gattii_ can potentially cause an
infection known as cryptococcosis. Not everyone who is exposed to
_Cryptococcus gattii_ will develop the disease. It is not yet clear
why some people become infected and others do not.
Q: What is cryptococcosis?
A: Cryptococcosis is a rare but treatable fungal infection that is
acquired by breathing in spores or small yeast cells from the air. In
humans, the disease usually affects the lungs. In some cases the
infection can spread to the central nervous system and cause
meningitis (a life-threatening inflammation of the tissues
surrounding the brain). Animals can also develop cryptococcosis, but
symptoms will vary from species to species.
Q: How many people have become infected with cryptococcosis in
British Columbia?
A: Between 1999 and 2006, there were 176 human cases reported in BC.
Approximately 27 cases were reported every year for an average annual
incidence rate of 6.5 cases per million in BC and 27.9 cases per
million on Vancouver Island in 2002-06. There have been 8 confirmed
mortalities due to _Cryptococcus gattii_, resulting in a 4.5 percent
mortality rate among confirmed cases.
Q: What are the symptoms of cryptococcosis?
A: Symptoms can appear 2-12 months or more after exposure to
_Cryptococcus gattii_ and may include:
- prolonged cough (lasting weeks or months)
- sharp chest pain
- unexplained shortness of breath
- severe headache
- fever
- night sweats
- weight loss
Note that exposure to _Cryptococcus gattii_ does not necessarily
result in infection. The reasons for some people becoming infected
and others not, even when they have similar exposures to the fungus,
are not clear.
Pet and livestock owners are advised to be alert for symptoms in
animals. Symptoms vary between species but can include a runny nose,
lumps under the skin, and infections of the lungs and central nervous
system. If your animal has these symptoms, your veterinarian can test
for _Cryptococcus gattii_ and provide the appropriate treatment.
Q: Can cryptococcosis be treated?
A: Cryptococcosis can be treated effectively with anti-fungal
medication. The earlier the disease is diagnosed and treatment
begins, the more effective the treatment is likely to be. There is no
vaccine available to prevent cryptococcosis.
Q: How can I protect myself or my pets from becoming infected with
_Cryptococcus gattii_?
A: At this time there is no reason to suggest that protective
measures would be beneficial in protecting individuals against
exposure to _Cryptococcus gattii_. Research is underway to determine
whether certain activities or behaviors increase the risk of
exposure. Personal risk factors for infection are largely unknown.
Q: Can I become sick if I am around a person or an animal that has
cryptococcal disease?
A: There is no evidence to suggest that _Cryptococcus gattii_ can be
transmitted from one person to another, between animals, or from
animals to humans.
Q: Is it safe to travel to Vancouver Island?
A: Yes. The risk of contracting cryptococcosis is low and the disease
can be successfully treated with anti-fungal medication.
_Cryptococcus gattii_ is found in many other travel destinations
besides Vancouver Island, including (but not limited to) California,
Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, and parts of Europe, Africa, and
South America.
Q: Where has _Cryptococcus gattii_ been found in British Columbia?
A: To date, _Cryptococcus gattii_ has been found in air, soil, and
water, as well as on trees across many locations on the east coast of
southern Vancouver Island. In addition, it has been found on some of
the Gulf Islands. If _Cryptococcus gattii_ has not been found in a
particular area, it does not necessarily mean that the fungus is not
present there, or will not be present in the future.
Q: How can I tell which trees contain _Cryptococcus gattii_?
A: You cannot tell which trees contain the fungus just by looking at
them. The fungus is tiny and cannot be seen with the naked eye. The
fungus can only be identified through laboratory testing.
Q: How can I tell if there is _Cryptococcus gattii_ in my community?
A: Testing of trees is being done in a number of areas in BC as part
of research on the general distribution of the _Cryptococcus gattii_.
It is not helpful to test specific neighborhoods. The fungus could be
present in an area even if some trees from that area test negative.
Q: What does it mean if trees in my community test positive for
_Cryptococcus gattii_?
A: It is likely that the fungus has been growing on trees in many
communities on the east coast of Vancouver Island for some time. Even
in an area that is positive for the _Cryptococcus gattii_, very few
people are likely to contract the disease. There is no reason to
avoid these areas or to restrict outdoor activities, because the
benefits of outdoor exercise greatly outweigh the risk of disease.
Q: Is there anything I can do to prevent _Cryptococcus gattii_ from
colonizing trees on my property?
A: No. There are no fungicides or other chemicals that can be applied
to trees to protect them. Cutting down trees is not recommended
because it will not prevent you from being exposed to _Cryptococcus
gattii_ -- the fungus may also be present in air, soil, and water.
Q: Are the parks open where _Cryptococcus gattii_ has been found?
A: Yes. All areas where _Cryptococcus gattii_ has been found remain
open for normal use. The benefits of outdoor recreation and exercise
far outweigh the risk of infection, and there is no reason to make
lifestyle changes because of this fungus.
In addition to the very useful Q&A section above, the reader is
directed to the ProMED-mail post 20070410.12.12.
Although this fungus affects animals, the lesions and signs in
animals are not well described. Presumably the initial clinical signs
are similar to the symptoms described in humans. - Mod.TG
