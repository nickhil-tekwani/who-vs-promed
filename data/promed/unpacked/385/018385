[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 471 417 with 81 285 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 390 132 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 201 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 48 521 cases when compared with the data on 24 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 13 554 (27.9%) cases, Italy accounting for 5210 (10.7%) cases, and Spain for 7457 (15.4%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 82.8% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 14.5% of the global cases of COVID-19. With the rate of growth of confirmed cases in the USA, within the next 24 hours, the total number of reported cases in the USA will surpass the total number reported in China. Italy will surpass the China total within the next 48 hours. A global total of 21 295 deaths have been reported, 18 008 outside mainland China.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world, and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering around or below 100 in recent days. Within 1-2 days, the USA will be number one outside of China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and Italy and Iran will drop back in their rankings. I repeat my request to see epidemic curves by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is, as I suspect now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days while awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

A total of 81 285 confirmed cases have been reported, and there are currently 159 suspected cases. A total of 695 305 close contacts were traced, and 14,714 were close contacts in medical observation.

There were 0 newly confirmed cases in Hubei (0 in Wuhan), 391 newly cured cases (382 in Wuhan), 6 new deaths (5 in Wuhan), and 3341 confirmed cases (3407 in Wuhan). Among them, 1201 were severe cases (1195 in Wuhan).

[This is the 2nd consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases reported from Wuhan or all of Hubei province in the past 24 hours, and also no suspected cases reported. This is a major milestone and the 2nd day zero cases, neither confirmed nor suspected, were identified. There are 67 newly confirmed cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours elsewhere in China, with all 67 identified as imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 285 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 67 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (24 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 6 deaths were reported, all in Hubei province (5 in Wuhan). 24 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. And Macau reported 4 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 30.

All 67 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Shanghai (18), Inner Mongolia (12), Guangdong (11), Beijing (6), Fujian (6), Shaanxi (3), Tianjin (2), Zhejiang (2), Yunnan (2), Jiangsu (2), Shanxi (1), Jilin (1), and Henan (1). bringing the total number of imported cases to 541.

As reported yesterday (24 Mar 2020), China is ending the lockdown in Hubei now, and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. There are claims that there continue to be asymptomatic positive individuals, an indicator that the virus is still circulating. If these rumors have validity, there will most likely be a recrudescence of transmission, but should that happen, presumably the public health structure in China will be activated and ready to prevent a repeat overwhelming situation as seen in January and February 2020. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 104 cases and 5 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (24-25 Mar 2020) when there were 100 newly confirmed cases. The daily case count has been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 5 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 70.1% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.8% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, for the 1st time in several weeks, yesterday (24 Mar 2020) Daegu did not report 40% or more of the newly confirmed cases, but only reported 14.0% of the newly confirmed cases in the preceding 24 hours. Today it reported 25%, significantly reduced from prior days. Increases in the proportion of newly confirmed case reporting were seen in Seoul at 12.5%, Gyeonggi at 13.5%, and Gyeongbuk at 11.5%. Quarantined imported cases represented 28.9% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. They are now up to 131 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

An English language MOH report from 25 Mar 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has information on the origin of the imported cases over the past 3 days:

Date: 23 Mar 2020 / 24 Mar 2020 / 25 Mar 2020
Total confirmed cases: 64 / 76 / 100
Total confirmed imported cases: 18 (28.2%) / 25 (32.9%) / 51 (51.0%)
Europe: 7 / 20 / 29 (59.8% of 3 day total)
USA: 11 / 5 / 13 (30.9% of 3 day total)
Others: 0 / 0 / 9 (9.6% of 3 day total)
It would be interesting to see similar data from China. - Mod.MPP]

Cases in Italy as of 6:00 pm 25 Mar 2020
----------------------------------------
Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 74 386 total cases. At the moment 57 521 people are positive for the virus, 9362 people have recovered. There are 23 112 patients hospitalized with symptoms, in 3489 intensive care, and 30 920 are in home isolation.

There have been 7503 reported deaths, however this number can only be confirmed after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 74 386 cases, including 7503 deaths, up from 69 176 cases and 6820 deaths reported on 24 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 24 and 25 Mar 2020 was 5210 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5249 newly confirmed cases between 23 and 24 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (32 346), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (10 054), and Venice (6442), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 56.4% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 6024 cases and represents 9.8% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, hopefully the 27.0% decrease in reported cases over a 72 hour period was a sign of slowing down of transmission, and not of reporting variance, although there has been an increase over the past 2 days. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this lockdown is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/coronavirus-iran-death-toll-rises-to-2077-with-cases-up-to-27017-1.1585152912065


Iran's coronavirus death toll has risen to 2077 after reporting 143 new fatalities, the Ministry of Health announced on Wednesday [25 Mar 2020]. "The country has reported 2206 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of infections to 27 017," said Health Ministry's spokesperson Kianoush Jahanpour in a press conference on coronavirus updates.

He said 9625 previously infected people have already recovered. With the number of deaths exceeding 2000, Iran is now the world's 6th worst -- hit country by the potentially fatal pandemic after Italy, China, US, Spain, and Germany.

[In the 24 hours from 24 to 25 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 24 811 to 27 017, an increase of 2206 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 1934 to 2077 an increase of 143 deaths in the 24-hour period.

As I have mentioned for the past few days, the significant translocation of the population for the holidays is of concern as it may lead to continued intra country/provincial exportations of the virus. According to other media reports, the planned strategy for the next phase of containment is to prevent internal dislocations in the country, through a country-wide "stay at home" (https://hotair.com/archives/john-s-2/2020/03/25/irans-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-2000-new-travel-restrictions-put-place/).

[A daily newsletter was produced by the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the ebolavirus outbreak. Now that transmission of the ebolavirus has been interrupted (waiting for 2 incubation periods for announcement), the Ministry has been issuing the same platform bulletin daily in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.- Mod.MPP]

Welcome to this new daily bulletin on the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This bulletin presents daily official and authorized information on the entire situation of the Covid-19 in the DRC.

Epidemiological evolution of COVID-19 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

- Since the start of the epidemic declared on [10 Mar 2020], the cumulative total is 51 confirmed cases. In total, there were 3 deaths, including:
- 3 new confirmed cases;
- no new deaths from confirmed cases;
- pending approval by the competent services, the number of people cured will be given in the next bulletins.

News

- The President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Head of State, Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, announced Tuesday [24 Mar 2020] on the National Radio and Television, in his message to the nation, additional measures for the implementation of its previous decisions to contain COVID-19 in the DRC.

- Among the decisions taken, the President of the Republic, in view of the seriousness and dangerous nature of the current health situation, declared a state of health emergency in the DRC.

- "We must all arm ourselves with a solid spirit of resignation and give up all activities incompatible with the measures and the recommendations of the Government which must on no occasion be ruined," said the Head of State, specifying that the 1sr decisions taken were not" sufficiently followed by the population."

- This is how he decided to reinforce the measures announced on [18 Mar 2020] by prohibiting, among other things, movements between Kinshasa, the focus of the pandemic, and the provinces and vice versa. This decision cancels all migratory movements by air, land, and river.

- He also decided to close all of the country's borders, except for humanitarian convoys, especially food and medicine. Barriers will be erected to subject all crews to "rigorous departure and arrival control" in terms of COVID-19.

- He instructed the political and administrative authorities in Kinshasa to prohibit all gatherings and to install hand-washing points throughout the city, as well as to support the specialized services of N'djili airport "so that no one 'escapes hygiene control'.

- The Head of State Felix-Antoine Tshisekedi, calling for the unity of the nation, announced the imminent establishment of a National Solidarity Fund against the coronavirus. He reassured that the Task Force which he chairs reflects, "without delay on the advisability of using tablets and injectables of hydroxy chloroquine, an approach likely to stem the coronavirus."

For access to Congolese territory
---------------------------------
1. Suspension, until further notice, from 20 Mar 2020, all flights from countries at risk and transit countries. Only airplanes and cargo ships and other means of freight transport will be authorized to enter the national territory and their personnel subject to controls.
2. Postponement of trips to the Democratic Republic of the Congo of all passengers residing in countries at risk until further notice.
3. Requirement for all passengers, upon arrival at national borders, to complete an information sheet and to submit, without exception, to the obligation to wash their hands and take their temperature.
4. Imposition of a quarantine of 14 days maximum on any person suspected at the end of the temperature test, a thorough examination, and if necessary to intern in the hospitals provided for this purpose, the people who would test positive.
5. Provision of all maritime, river, lake, and land entry points in the national territory with the same surveillance system to strengthen the control of passengers from abroad.
6. Systematically subjecting people leaving Kinshasa to the various provinces of the DRC to control measures in order to avoid the spread of this pandemic to the rest of our country.

For gatherings of people
------------------------
1. Prohibition of all gatherings, meetings, celebrations, of more than 20 people in public places outside the family home.
2. Closure of schools, universities, official, and private higher institutes throughout the national territory from [19 Mar 2020] for a period of 4 weeks.
3. Suspension of all services for a period of 4 weeks from [19 Mar 2020].
4. Suspension of sports activities in stadiums and other places of sports gathering until further notice.
5. Prohibition, until further notice, of the opening of discos, bars, cafes, terraces, and restaurants.
6. Ban on the organization of mourning in rooms and homes. The remains will be taken directly from the morgue to the place of burial and in a limited number of accompanying persons.
7. Management at government expense of all cases tested positive throughout the country.

[Many of the steps outlined in the report above are the same as what the DRC implements when they are dealing with an ebolavirus outbreak. A major challenge will be implementing these steps in Kinshasa, with an estimated population in 2018 of 13.2 million inhabitants (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.URB.LCTY?locations=CD).

What is interesting is that given a recognition of water access difficulties, hand washing stations will be set up around the city to permit frequent hand washing.

Note that the Hopkins CSSE data and the Worldometer data show 45 and 48 cases reported from Congo DR as of midnight 26 Mar 2020, whereas the official government tally as of 24 Mar 2020 is 51. - Mod.MPP

[6] ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment
Date: Wed 25 Mar 2020
Source: European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Rapid Risk Assessment [abridged, edited]

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: increased transmission in the EU/EEA and the UK -- 7th update, 25 Mar 2020. Stockholm: ECDC; 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Executive summary
-----------------
As of [25 Mar 2020], more than 416 916 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide by more than 150 countries. An increasing proportion of global cases are from EU/EEA countries and the UK. As of [25 Mar 2020], 204 930 cases and 11 810 deaths have been reported in the EU/EEA and the UK. The number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in all EU/EEA countries and the UK, and the notification rate is increasing at similar trajectory as was observed in Hubei province in late January/early February [2020] and in Italy in late February/early March [2020].

Clinical presentations of COVID-19 range from no symptoms (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia; severe disease can lead to death. In EU/EEA countries with available data, 30% of diagnosed COVID-19 cases were hospitalised and 4% had severe illness. Hospitalisation rates were higher for those aged 60 years and above. Estimates of crude case-fatality for Germany, Italy and Spain showed that both the risk and absolute numbers of deaths rapidly increased with age for those aged 60 years and above in each country. Among hospitalised cases, severe illness was reported in 15% of cases, and death occurred in 12% of these cases, with higher case-fatality rates in older adults.

Risk assessment
---------------
In the present situation where COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in Europe, the current assessment is:
- The risk of severe disease associated with COVID-19 for people in the EU/EEA and the UK is currently considered moderate for the general population and very high for older adults and individuals with chronic underlying conditions.
- The risk of occurrence of widespread national community transmission of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is moderate if effective mitigation measures are in place and very high if insufficient mitigation measures are in place.
- The risk of healthcare system capacity being exceeded in the EU/EEA and the UK in the coming weeks is considered high.

Measures taken at this stage should ultimately aim at protecting the most vulnerable population groups from severe illness and fatal outcome by reducing transmission in the general population and enabling the reinforcement of healthcare systems. Given the current epidemiology and risk assessment, and the expected developments in the next days to few weeks, the following public health measures to reduce further spread and mitigate the impact of the pandemic should be applied in EU/EEA countries [available at the source URL above].

The main developments since the [12 Mar 2020] risk assessment can be summarised as follows:
- All EU/EEA countries and more than 150 countries worldwide are affected.
- While early in the outbreak most cases were reported in China; since [12 Mar 2020], 63% of the reported global cases have been from EU/EEA countries and the UK.
- Overall since the start of the pandemic in the EU/EEA and the UK and since [25 Mar 2020], 204 930 cases and 11 810 deaths have been reported. Italy, Spain, Germany and France represent 34% (n=69 176), 19% (n=39 673), 15% (n=31 554) and 11% (n=22 302) of all EU/EEA cases, respectively. Italy and Spain represent 58% (n=6 820) and 23% (n=2 696) of the fatalities in the EU/EEA, respectively.
- The 14-day cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19, a measure of the prevalence of active cases in the population, is 36.1 per 100 000 population in the EU/EEA as of [25 Mar 2020], ranging from low rates of 2.2 in Hungary and 2.3 in Poland to 97.7 per 100 000 in Italy, and more than 100 per 100 000 in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg (Annex 3). All EU/EEA countries and the UK report increased numbers of cases and increased rates since [12 Mar 2020]. The large growth in the 14-days cumulative notification rate observed in EU/EEA countries like Luxembourg, Iceland, and Lichtenstein is due to the small size of their population (Figures 1 and 2 [figures and annexes available at the source URL above].
- Assuming stable testing policies and no effect of mitigation measures, the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom is predicted to reach 100 COVID-19 cases per 100 000 population (the Hubei scenario) between the end of March [2020] and mid-April [2020] (Figures A and B, Annex 2).
- In Italy, after the peak on [21 Mar 2020] when 6557 new cases were reported, the number of new cases reported daily appears to be decreasing. This appears to have occurred roughly 2 weeks after control measures (stay-at-home restrictions) were implemented, first in northern Italy [9 Mar 2020] and then in the whole country [11 Mar 2020].
- Reports from some healthcare facilities in northern Italy indicate that intensive care capacity has been exceeded due to the high volume of patients requiring ventilation. Other EU areas with a large number of reported cases may experience the same challenges.

COVID-19: symptoms, severity, and case fatality:
------------------------------------------------
By [24 Mar 2020], 50 569 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported to the European Surveillance System (TESSy). Information on symptoms was available for 14 011 cases from 13 countries, mainly (97%) from Germany. Among these cases, the most commonly reported clinical symptom was fever (47%), dry or productive cough (25%), sore throat (16%), general weakness (6%) and pain (5%). The frequency of these symptoms differs notably from those reported from China [8] and is summarised in the 6th update of ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment. Data on cases reported more recently to TESSy may be biased toward the more seriously ill because national policies have shifted focus towards testing of more severe cases.

Preliminary estimates of severity were based on the analysis of data from EU/EEA countries and the UK available in TESSy and online country reports (for countries whose data was incomplete or missing in TESSy).

Among all cases:
- Hospitalisation occurred in 30% (13 122 of 43 438) of cases reported from 17 countries (median country specific estimate, interquartile range (IQR): 24%, 11-41%)
- Severe illness (requiring ICU and/or respiratory support) accounted for 2 179 of 49 282 (4%) cases from 16 countries (median, IQR: 3%, 2-8%).

Among hospitalised cases:
- Severe illness was reported in 15% (1 894 of 12 961) of hospitalised cases from 15 countries (median, IQR: 16%, 10-24%).
- Death occurred in 1 457 of 12 551 (12%) hospitalised cases from eight countries (median, IQR: 10%, 6- 14%). Age-specific hospitalisation rates among all cases based on TESSy data showed elevated risk among those aged 60 years and above (Figure 3).

[New South Wales (NSW) Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant] said there were now 147 cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, 121 of which are in NSW.

[Premier Gladys Berejiklian] said it was promising that NSW had seen a small reduction in the number of cases overnight and it was even more "promising that very few people had died."

But she said it did not mean the state was out of a "critical" situation. "We say to everyone please take this seriously, we don't want to use police but we will," Ms Berejiklian said.

Hawke's Bay has 3 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and one of them could be related to community transmission. The latest 3 cases takes the total COVID-19 cases in Hawke's Bay to 6.

Director General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the Ruby Princess cruise ship which visited the Hawke's Bay was being treated as a potential viral cluster when people on the ship had gone to a winery. He said a person in Hawke's Bay had become infected with Covid-19 after coming into contact with a positive case on the Ruby Princess - but that had not been a close contact.

Hawke's Bay District Health Board's Medical Officer of Health, Dr Rachel Eyre said 2 of the 3 cases were returned from overseas travel. The 3rd case was not linked to overseas travel but did have a connection to cruise ship -- The Ruby Princess. The Ruby Princess visited Napier on [15 Mar 2020], before cruise ships were banned.

Dr Eyre said anyone who had COVID-19 symptoms and came into close contact for 15 minutes or longer with passengers from The Ruby Princess, which docked [15 Mar 2020] in Napier Port, and is now symptomatic should call their GP. If someone was symptomatic and in isolation with others they should further distance themselves and have as little contact as possible with anyone else in their household, not share crockery and be vigilant regarding cleaning and hand washing.

While this case was still being investigated and Hawke's Bay DHB's Public Health team and the National Contact Tracing Service were following this up, it was known that places visited by the confirmed case while symptomatic were:
Gladys Mary Care Home, Tamatea, [17, 18, 19 and 20 Mar 2020]
Hohepa, Clive, [18 Mar 2020]
Harvey Norman, Hastings [19 Mar 2020 10am]
Cornucopia, Hastings,
Weleda, Havelock North, [19 Mar 2020]
Te Mata Bakery, [19 Mar 2020]
Mission Winery, [19 Mar 2020]

Dr Eyre said while the chance of infection being passed on while the person was visiting shops and wineries was low, anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 should call their GP.

In relation to The Gladys Mary Care Home the Public Health and infection prevention teams were working closely with the staff and all close contacts have been identified. The home did have a resident that was symptomatic and linked to the confirmed case. Test results were due tomorrow. In the meantime every precaution was being taken and the home was closed to all visitors.

[Cruise ships have continued to maintain a focus as a source of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in this pandemic. The cruise ship industry has virtually come to a halt in the Americas, Europe, and Northern Western Pacific region. From the media reports out of Australia and New Zealand, they are still active. It sounds like both New Zealand and Australia have chains of transmission related to passengers from cruise ships who disembarked at stops as well as at final ports on return. The SARS-CoV-2 is not a nice virus, it spreads easily and insidiously through communities once it gets the chance. - Mod.MPP

- EPI-WIN, WHO's information network for epidemics, makes easy-to-understand advice and information available on a dedicated page on the WHO website. EPI-WIN is also providing employers and workers with timely information through regular calls. More information can be found on the web at https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication and in the 'subject in focus' section below.

Subject in focus: Infodemics management -- enabling safer workplaces in a time of COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO's Information Network for Epidemics (EPI-WIN) website (http://www.who.int/epi-win) was launched on [24 Mar 2020] and gives people access to timely, accurate, and easy-to-understand advice and information from trusted sources on the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, translating scientific information to actionable information. EPI-WIN's two-way communication network addresses key information needs while rebutting misinformation and fighting infodemics, which spread misinformation, create confusion and distrust among people, and hamper an effective response. The EPI-WIN website is aimed at a wide range of audiences including
- individuals and communities,
- the health sector,
- countries,
- the travel and tourism sector,
- faith-based organizations and faith leaders,
- large event organizers, and
- employers and employees

Of the world's population of around 8 billion, over 3 billion are in paid employment. National and international trade unions represent the rights and welfare of workers not only in relation to employment but also often in relation to their families and communities and are regarded as trusted sources of information and advice by their members.

EPI-WIN is engaging closely with employers and workers through different entities and organizations that serve as amplifiers with the capacity to reach vast numbers of people with life-saving information and guidance. The International Organization of Employers alone reaches 50 million businesses in 150 countries. Among several other entities and organizations, EPI-WIN has strong links with trade unions through the International Labour Organization (ILO)'s the Bureau of Workers' Activities (ACTRAV), the International Trade Union Confederation and the global sectoral unions, reaching over 210 million workers and their families in 163 countries.

To best respond to the need for timely information of these different audiences, EPI-WIN conducts regular calls with the different sectors. On [23 Mar 2020], WHO and the International Occupational Medicine Society Collaboration (IOMSC) conducted a webinar on "Occupational Health Measures in the Preparedness and Response to COVID19 in the Workplace." Approximately 225 participants registered for the webinar including IOMSC Occupational Medical Society members as well as other Occupational Medical Society physician leaders from around the world. Participant questions were notably around the themes of: workplace transmission of COVID-19; the use of masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) by healthcare and other public-facing workers; the use of rapid tests for COVID19 to screen workers in workplaces; "Return to Work" guidance; and mental health and psychosocial impacts in workplaces, in particular health facilities.

Two additional webinars are scheduled for Thursday [26 Mar 2020], the 1st with the European Federation of Public Service Unions (EPSU), representing 8 million workers, and the 2nd a videoconference with the International Organization of Employers (IOE): "Summit on the collaboration of the private sector with health systems in emergency situations."

Employers and employees have a crucial role to play in stopping COVID-19 and reducing the impact of the disease on society. A key area of EPI-WIN's work focuses on how to create a COVID-safe workplace and prevent transmission of the disease between employees through the following measures:

Preventing transmission of COVID-19 between employees
- implement remote work practices (tele-working);
- social distancing measures in the workplace when on-site presence is required (at least 1 metre) [3 ft];
- hold fewer in-person meetings;
- restrict the number of visitors entering the workplace;
- limit travel beyond non-essential travel;
- ensure people with symptoms or with family members with symptoms self-quarantine for 14 days;
- check the body temperature of employees daily so that employees with fever don't come to work;
- facilitate access to reliable information for employees to promote understanding of the disease and its symptoms and the personal preventative measures (respiratory etiquette, hand washing, self-isolation if sick);
- check and follow the advice from the authorities in the community before holding a meeting or event; follow all necessary precautions, protective and self-isolation measures, should a meeting go ahead.

Maintain a safe and healthy work environment
- develop a business continuity plan;
- develop a contingency and business continuity plan for an outbreak in the communities where your business operates and for when your employees return to work during or after COVID-19 according to national and local health authorities;
- promote regular and thorough hand washing by employees, contractors and customers, as well as good respiratory hygiene;
- clean workspaces frequently with disinfectant including high risk areas/space (such as door handle, reception counter, elevators, disinfection of working stations of COVID-19 cases);
- provide alcohol-based gel or washing hands stations;
- establish a reporting system for any cases among employees;
- establish a system to quarantine close contacts of a suspect or confirmed case among the employees;
- ensure good ventilation;
- develop a food delivery system that reduces contacts with food deliverers and avoid employee lines;
- ensure psycho-social support of employees during the pandemic. incorporate mental health resources into human resources policies. your employees may be suffering from emotional distress during this period; and may also suffer distress when experiencing changes like returning to work.

- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 195. This includes 17 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 48 countries (including 11 territories) from the Americas region, and 39 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 11 390 new cases in the past 24 hours of which 85.6% were reported by the USA, and 5.8% reported by Brazil. The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 25 027 new cases and 1797 deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy accounting for 21.0 % of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 26.3% of newly confirmed cases, Germany accounting for 9.4% of newly confirmed cases, and France accounting for 9.6% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 66.3% of newly confirmed cases in Europe, down from 72.8% yesterday 24 Mar 2020).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [25 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. I keep repeating that it would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
