The dengue fever outbreak usually reaches its peak in Indonesia in March, but even this month [June 2020] there was still a significant increase in cases from 100 to 500 per day.
The ministry also found that provinces with the highest number of dengue fever cases also report the most COVID-19 cases, including West Java, Bali, East Nusa Tenggara, East Java, Lampung, West Nusa Tenggara, Jakarta, Central Java, Yogyakarta, Riau and South Sulawesi. Moreover, 439 out of 460 cities and districts throughout Indonesia also reported double infection cases.

Many buildings such as hotels, schools and places of worship have also been left empty for a long time as people stay home during the lockdown, which meant building managers need to get rid of mosquito infestations before reopening them, Nadia said.

- National. 21 Jun 2020. Singapore had 211 active dengue clusters as of 15 Jun 2020 and at least 11 166 people are known to have caught the virus from 1 Jan to 15 Jun 2020, according to data from the National Environment Agency. Infections may match or top the 22 170 cases reported in 2013, the largest dengue outbreak in the city-state's history. The disease, which can cause a spectrum of illness including fatal shock, is caused by one of 4 virus types. The less-common type 3, or DenV-3, has driven the outbreak -- the 1st time it's been the dominant strain in Singapore in almost 3 decades. Low protective immunity to DenV-3 in the community has enabled it to flourish, the environment agency said.

Thailand
- National. 13 Jun 2020. While the COVID-19 outbreak is easing in Thailand, there is growing alarm over a nationwide outbreak of dengue fever, which has sickened nearly 6000 children already this year [2020], 4 of whom died. On 2 Jun 2020, Thailand had recorded 15 385 cases of dengue fever, which killed 11 people, according to the director-general of the Department of Disease Control. Delaying treatment, underlying medical conditions and obesity all increase the chances of the mosquito-borne virus being fatal. A recent investigation found mosquito larvae are still prevalent at Thai school campuses, some which are set to reopen on Monday [15 Jun 2020] as more Emergency Decree restrictions are lifted. Most were found in unused containers, plant pots, and old tyres, places where stagnant water is allowed to collect.

[Dengue fever is a major public health problem worldwide. The vector-borne acute febrile viral illness has widespread distribution throughout the tropical regions and is associated with risk factors like unusual rainfall, ambient temperatures for the propagation of the vector carrying the virus, relative humidity, urbanization, and a lack in vector control services in the community. Dengue fever is endemic in more than 100 countries from all regions of WHO (http://www.who.int/denguecontrol/epidemiology/en/).

During 2019, several South Asian and Pacific region countries experienced large-scale dengue fever outbreaks with several thousand cases. In 2020, the dengue control program in the countries should continue to focus on strengthening surveillance, enhancing detection and case management capacity, health education, and implementing integrated vector control measures. - Mod.UBA]
