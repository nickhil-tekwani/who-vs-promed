The bluetongue virus zone has moved further south following recent testing results.

Northern [Western Australia] cattle stations are being tested for the virus, under the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP).

Although a handful of stations are yet to be tested, results have already found 10 stations are in the bluetongue zone.

Unlike the Eastern States and the Kimberley, the Pilbara is within the bluetongue-free zone.

Department of Agriculture and Food animal disease surveillance manager Marion Seymour said 10 new pastoral leases were recently included into the bluetongue zone in the shires of Derby, West Kimberley, and Halls Creek in July [2014] due to the new detection of bluetongue virus transmission near Fitzroy Crossing.

The southern stations included in the zone did not wish to be named publicly, but Haydn Sale who runs Yougawalla Pastoral Company's Yougawalla, Bulka and Margaret River stations, near Fitzroy Crossing, said it will definitely affect them.

"All 3 of our properties were outside the zone, and as of Friday week; we have now moved into the zone," Mr Sale said. "This has a massive impact on us, as we had the option of a variety of markets before. Now, we can't send our cattle as easily to the Middle East, Israel or Jordan, which have been good markets for us in the past few years. It's a massive issue for us if China comes about; they won't take us unless the government looks at that. The issue for China, a developing market, is they don't take bluetongue cattle as part of their protocol. So that wipes out all of us in the north, so hopefully they will drop bluetongue out of the protocol ... as it only affects sheep and not cattle" [Sadly, bluetongue virus does affect cattle. - Mod.TG]

Mr Sale said even though 2 of his stations had been in the zone 12 months ago, they had the option to move those cattle south to their bluetongue free zone station for 60 days before they were exported to those markets.

He said they still had that option, but it was not as viable now as most of the area was in the zone. "It's pretty disappointing for everyone that we have lost (the ease of access to) all those market options and can't export straight from the station," Mr Sale said. "To have all those options was good, we still have Indonesia, but I wouldn't like to bet on the fact they will continue to take as much as they have previously."

Explaining the zone change, Dr Seymour said if evidence of bluetongue virus was detected, the bluetongue zone was increased to reflect this change. Areas could be reclassified as a free zone after 2 years of monitoring without finding evidence of bluetongue virus.

Testing is carried out in locations where the infection may occur sporadically and in other areas which are expected to be arbovirus-free (such as further south) in order to verify the free zone. The testing is completed under the NAMP, which specifically monitors for the bluetongue virus, Akabane and bovine ephemeral fever.

Dr Seymour said that some of the countries that import live cattle, including China and Israel, required that Australia certifies that the cattle are sourced from areas free of the virus. But she said most pastoralists in WA's north will not be affected, as they export to Indonesia and Egypt.

"When carrying out NAMP testing, we hope we will not find evidence of the virus so that pastoralists have access to these markets but it is important to undertake the surveillance so that importing countries have confidence in our surveillance systems," she said. "Without the testing carried out under NAMP, WA livestock would be ineligible to be exported to bluetongue-sensitive countries as we would not be able to provide evidence of which areas are free of the virus. The cooperation of the cattle industry across Australia is crucial to the surveillance activity."

The NAMP also monitors the distribution of economically important insect-borne viruses of livestock and their vectors.

This season's properties in the bluetongue virus free zones of WA as of July 2014 include the Shires of Broome, East Pilbara, Roebourne, Ashburton and shires south of the Pilbara.

Officers are finishing off the last of the blood samples at cattle stations at strategic sites in WA, while DAFWA's animal health laboratories analyses the samples.

[Bluetongue virus (BTV) can and does affect cattle.

The disease is caused by an orbivirus belonging to the family _Reoviridae_. There are 25 serotypes of bluetongue virus and 10 of these have been isolated in Australia. Orbiviruses are insect-borne viruses (arboviruses) transmitted by _Culicoides_ midges. Many other non bluetongue orbiviruses are also endemic in Australia.

Bluetongue is an insect-borne, viral disease that can affect sheep, goats, deer, and cattle. Sheep are the most seriously affected species; clinical disease and mortalities occur and production and trade losses may result. Most infections in cattle are unapparent.

A number of bluetongue serotypes are present in Australia, but the severe clinical disease seen in other countries has not occurred here. Disease has been produced in experimentally infected sheep with some serotypes present in Australia.

Bluetongue virus serotype 1 was first identified in Australia in 1975 from trapped insects in the Northern Territory (NT) but despite its long-term presence, it has not caused any clinical disease. Since that time 9 more serotypes have been isolated in the NT. The distribution of BTV in Australia has been monitored in the National Arbovirus Monitoring Program (NAMP) for many years and the zones of BTV virus transmission and freedom are mapped and updated regularly on the Animal Health Australia website.

The virus is endemic in northern Australia (Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia) and its distribution extends down the east coast into New South Wales, south of Sydney, in years that are favourable for the vector.

The disease is characterised by fever, widespread haemorrhages of the oral and nasal tissue, excessive salivation, and nasal discharge. In acute cases the lips and tongue become swollen and this swelling may extend below the lower jaw. The blue tongue that gives the disease its name occurs only in small number of cases. Lameness occurs due to laminitis and inflammation of the coronary band [of the foot] -- a dark red to purple band in the skin above the coronet is an important diagnostic sign [see photo: https://www.spc.int/lrd/ext/Disease_Manual_Final/Reddening)_blue_Tongue.jpg. - Mod.JW]

Emaciation and weakness develop rapidly and death occurs about 6 days after 1st signs occur. Convalescence of surviving sheep is slow. The high fever in sheep results in wool breaks, which adds to production losses.

The virus cannot be transmitted between susceptible animals without the presence of the _Culicoides_ vector. The incidence and geographical distribution of BTV depends on seasonal conditions, the presence of insect vectors, and the availability of the susceptible species of animals.

The insect vectors, biting midges, prefer warm, moist conditions and are in their greatest numbers and most active after rains. Bluetongue virus does not survive outside the insect vectors or susceptible hosts. Animal carcasses and products such as meat and wool are not a method of spread. Survival of the virus within a location is dependent on whether the vector can overwinter in that area.

In countries where bluetongue outbreaks occur, the strategy is to contain the outbreak and minimize trade impact by:
- using a combination of quarantine and movement controls to prevent spread;
- treatments and husbandry procedures to control vectors, reduce transmission and protect susceptible animals;
- tracing and surveillance to determine the extent of virus and vector distribution;
- zoning to define infected and disease-free areas.

There is no justification for stamping out but some animals may need to be destroyed for welfare reasons. It is not possible to eradicate the bluetongue vectors. Vaccines are used in many countries, including Europe, to control the disease.

It should be noted that people are not affected by this virus.
