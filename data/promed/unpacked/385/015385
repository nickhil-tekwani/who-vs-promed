Disease fears for South West vines
Fears are rising that the South West wine region could be infected with the
potentially devastating downy mildew disease. It follows the discovery of
an outbreak in the Swan Valley. Eleven properties have now been quarantined
in the Swan valley and sampling of suspect properties continues.
Agriculture WA [West Australia] officers are expected to start inspecting
vines in the South West wine [production] region. The Margaret River Wine
Industry Association has written to its members outlining the dangers of
the disease and advising them to apply preventive fungicide. Simon
Robertson, viticulturist says the disease is easily transported by wind and
[by the] movement of soil and vehicles and would eventually reach the South
West region.
