CONFIRMATORY TESTS BEING CONDUCTED ON MICHIGAN WILD BIRD SAMPLES
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior today announced that
routine surveillance has indicated the presence of H5 and N1 avian
influenza subtypes in samples from 2 wild mute swans in Michigan, but
testing has ruled out the possibility of this being the highly
pathogenic H5N1 strain that has spread through birds in Asia, Europe
and Africa. Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenicity
avian influenza [LPAI], which poses no threat to human health.
The swans were sampled as part of the expanded avian influenza
surveillance program. They were showing no signs of sickness, which
suggests that this is indeed LPAI. Additionally, genetic analysis of
the virus conducted at USDA's National Veterinary Services
laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, suggests that it is similar to a
low pathogenicity strain that has been found in North America.
It is possible that these birds were not infected with an H5N1
strain, but instead with 2 separate avian influenza viruses, one
containing H5 and the other containing N1. The confirmatory testing
underway at NVSL will clarify whether one or more strains of the
virus are present, the specific subtype, as well as pathogenicity.
These results are expected within 2 weeks and will be made public
when completed.
*****It should be noted that wild birds are known to harbor many
influenza viruses, and the finding of one or more of these viruses
during routine testing is not unusual.*****
The swans were sampled on 8 Aug 2006 at the Mouillee state game area
located on the coast of Lake Erie in Monroe County, Michigan. The
samples were taken by USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) personnel as part of an expanded wild bird monitoring
program. The Departments of Agriculture and Interior are working
collaboratively with States to sample wild birds throughout the
United States for the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Initial screening tests on the swan samples were conducted by
Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and
Animal Health -- part of USDA's National Animal Health Laboratory
Network. These tests indicated the presence of an H5 avian influenza
virus. Confirmatory testing at NVSL confirmed the H5 and the N1. This
testing also suggests, but has not yet confirmed, that this is low
pathogenicity avian influenza.
LPAI commonly occurs in wild birds, where it typically causes only
minor signs or no noticeable signs. These strains of the virus are
not a human health concern. This includes LPAI H5N1, commonly
referred to as the North American H5N1. This strain of low
pathogenicity avian influenza is very different from the more severe
high pathogenicity HPAI H5N1 circulating overseas, which is commonly
referred to as the Asian H5N1.
Evidence of LPAI H5N1 has been found on 2 occasions in wild birds in
the United States. In 1975 and 1986, it was detected in wild ducks.
These detections occurred as part of routine sampling. LPAI H5N1 has
also been detected in Canada, most recently in 2005.

[It should be stressed that wild birds can, and often do, carry low
pathogenicity avian influenza. USDA is to be commended for their
surveillance. We look forward to the final results as to how many
strains may be involved. Additionally, mute swans are not native to
the US. - Mod.TG]
