Two suspected Congo fever [Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, CCHF] patients were admitted to a Quetta hospital Sunday night [23 May 2021]. Noorullah Moosakhail, the medical superintendent of Fatima Jinnah Chest and General Hospital, said that 2 patients came to the hospital with symptoms similar to Congo fever. Their samples have been taken and sent to the laboratory.

The patients have been moved to the hospital's isolation ward and their symptoms are being monitored.

Congo fever is [transmitted] by the bite of a tick carrying the Congo virus. It is usually transferred to humans from livestock animals through the tick or by coming in contact with the blood, fluids, or meat of an infected animal. It can also be transmitted between humans by close contact or through body fluids and blood.

Congo fever symptoms include high-grade fever, muscle ache, vomiting, or diarrhoea with blood, bleeding from the gums or mouth, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, and sore throat.

There's no treatment or vaccine for the disease. Patients are usually given supportive treatment such as fluid therapy, oxygen, antibiotics to prevent bacterial infection, and sometimes antivirals.

[CCHF is caused by a tick-borne virus, _Orthonairovirus_, of the family Nairoviridae that causes severe viral haemorrhagic fever. The virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases occur in individuals involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission can result from close contact with blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Hospital-acquired infections have been reported due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies. Nosocomial transmission of CCHF through contact with body fluids of infected patients has been reported from different endemic countries including Pakistan.

In absence of an effective vaccine, and in view of Eid ul-Azha (Feast of Sacrifice, 19-23 Jul 2021), which entails large scale movement and sale of cattle and livestock, taking measures to prevent exposure to the virus is the key to preventing tick-to-human, animal-to-human, and human-to-human transmission in the community. Educating the general public about handling sacrificial animals and raw meat/blood, etc., can help minimise exposure and potential transmission.

The WHO recommendations to prevent CCHF are available at https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever. - Mod.UBA
