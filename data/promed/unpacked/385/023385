Hundreds of cows and goats have been dying for the last 6 months in Subansiri Chapori of Lakhimpur district [Assam] of diseases unknown to the local herders.

The river islands of Subansiri [see map at https://tinyurl.com/ybohvzf7] has a large number cattle farms, locally known as khuti, where thousands of buffaloes, cows and goats are kept by herders for dairy and livestock business. But in the last 6 months, these animals are dying, resulting in huge losses caused to the traditional cattle herders in this riverine area.

The herders have informed that their animals are dying after grazing on the grass which remains submerged during the monsoon season following the receding of the water level.

"This phenomenon has been observed in the last 3 years and this time the number of casualties is much higher," said the cattle herders.

The worst hit river island this time is Subansiri Chapori where hundreds of cows and goats have died so far in the last few days. "Many goats have been found with infected faces which are very unusual," said a local herder.

The affected cattle herders of Subansiri Chapori have asked the authorities concerned to investigate the causes of this unknown disease and the quality of the river water for the security of their diary and livestock business.

[The report includes a photograph of a "goat with infected face", accompanied by the herder's remark, "Many goats have been found with infected faces which are very unusual." The picture shows highly proliferative lesions around the lips and, to a lesser extent, in the armpits. The plausible involvement of severe contagious ecthyma (orf) infection deserves to be checked. This (zoonotic) virus of small ruminants could, in severe cases, cause considerable mortality. Confirmation or otherwise, and exclusion of other clinical signs and etiologies, is anticipated.

As to cattle and buffaloes: in the absence of information on their clinical signs, gross pathological changes, and epidemiological statistics (morbidity and mortality numbers and rates), the etiology of their deaths remains to be obtained if/when veterinary investigation is carried out and becomes public.

The report covers an extended period, relating to cows and goats which "have been dying for the last 6 months"; more than a single etiology, in each of the named species, could be involved. - Mod.AS
