An epidemic of a deadly strain of _Salmonella_ has swept across the whole of Africa by "taking advantage" of the spread of HIV, according to an international team of researchers. Their study, published in Nature Genetics, is the 1st to identify the separate cases as a single epidemic. 1 in 4 people in Africa infected with the strain died.

It is thought to be the 1st time a single strain of an infection has spread so widely in the wake of HIV. Cases of this form of invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis have been recognized in Africa for more than a decade. It causes fever, headaches, respiratory problems, and sometimes death.

The research team analyzed the genetic code of 179 strains of the serotype from different parts of Africa and the rest of the globe. Using techniques similar to a large-scale DNA paternity test, they were able to construct the strain's "family tree" and then how it spread. It happened in 2 waves. The 1st started in south eastern Africa about 52 years ago and the 2nd wave started 35 years ago from the Congo Basin.

Prof Gordon Dougan, from the Sanger Institute in Cambridge in the UK, told the BBC: "It quite clearly parallels the emergence of HIV in Africa." HIV attacks the immune system and leaves people more vulnerable to other infections. It is thought the strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium took advantage of this weakness and spread. The research team said the bacterium was given the chance to "enter, adapt, circulate and thrive."

There is poor monitoring data for the disease across the whole of the continent, but Prof Dougan said it was affecting "thousands and thousands" of people and that 98 percent of adult cases were in people with HIV.

Prof Brendan Wren, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said this spread of _S._ Typhimurium had been different to that of other infections commonly associated with HIV, as it had been a single epidemic "people were completely unaware" of and there "were not really any other examples" of that happening.

Dr Melita Gordon, a gastroenterologist at the University of Liverpool, said: "It's the 1st time this has been described right across a continent in such an obvious way." She added, "The highest mortality associated with the disease is 80 percent. What's happened over the years is mortality has fallen down and down and down to between 20 percent and 25 percent as doctors inside Africa recognise it."

The genetic analysis also showed the strain was resistant to the 1st choice antibiotic, chloramphenicol, which means more expensive drugs would be needed to treat the infection.

It is thought that improving HIV treatment across Africa could reduce the prevalence of the _Salmonella_ infection, as it would reduce the number of people with vulnerable immune systems. However, the researchers urged "vigilance" in case the _Salmonella_ strain mutated again to become able to infect people with healthy immune systems.

Commenting on the study, Prof Brendan Wren, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC: "It's actually quite a huge problem and it seems to be getting worse because there are many susceptible people, it's got a grip in Africa. HIV, I think it's fair to say, provided a springboard for it to take off." However, he thought the disease was "near its peak" as HIV was more controlled in other continents giving it little room to spread.

Nature Genetics, doi:10.1038/ng.2423. It's abstract is shown below:

"A highly invasive form of non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ (iNTS) disease has recently been documented in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common _Salmonella enterica_ serovar causing this disease is Typhimurium (_Salmonella_ Typhimurium). We applied whole-genome sequence-based phylogenetic methods to define the population structure of sub-Saharan African invasive _S._ Typhimurium isolates and compared these to global _S._ Typhimurium populations.

Notably, the vast majority of sub-Saharan invasive _S._ Typhimurium isolates fell within 2 closely related, highly clustered phylogenetic lineages that we estimate emerged independently about 52 and about 35 years ago in close temporal association with the current HIV pandemic. Clonal replacement of isolates from lineage I by those from lineage II was potentially influenced by the use of chloramphenicol for the treatment of iNTS disease.

Our analysis suggests that iNTS disease is in part an epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa caused by highly related _S._ Typhimurium lineages that may have occupied new niches associated with a compromised human population and antibiotic treatment."

One clinical observation regarding this remarkable epidemic is that, in this cohort of patients, the presentation is distinct from those both of gastroenteritis due to salmonellosis and from typhoid fever. The illness tends to be characterized by a nonspecific fever that can be indistinguishable from malaria and only in rare cases is accompanied by diarrhea. In some parts of Africa, this invasive salmonellosis has surpassed _S._ Typhi as the dominant cause of invasive disease due to salmonellosis. - Mod.LL
