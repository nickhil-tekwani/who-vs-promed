[There have now been 184 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 33 deaths reported from Korea. It is interesting that both yesterday and today (2 and 3 Jul 2015) the reported case has been a 24-year-old female nurse at Samsung Hospital. It would be interesting to know in what capacity these nurses were working that might explain how there was exposure to the virus in the healthcare setting.

[Cases are continuing to be identified in both the Eastern Province and Riyadh, with both newly reported cases apparently sporadic cases on initial investigation, as they both denied known contact with other MERS-CoV infected individuals. This is the 4th "sporadic" case reported in Riyadh in the past 5 days, and the 11th case reported since 11 May 2015 (9 of the 11 were "sporadic" cases). It seems an ideal setting for a case control study to determine possible other high risk exposures that may lead to these "sporadic" cases.

Dammam is located approximately 145 km (90 mi) to the Northeast of Hufoof in the Eastern Province, with a connecting roadway (?causeway vs. bridge) to Bahrain. One wonders if the South Korean index case in his travels to Saudi Arabia, spent time in the Eastern Province near Dammam... food for thought (a map of Saudi Arabia showing both Dammam and Hufoof can be found at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/cia14/saudi_arabia_sm_2014.gif).

A map of Saudi Arabia showing the location of the 2 newly confirmed cases can be found at the source URL. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3480481,131. - Mod.MPP]
