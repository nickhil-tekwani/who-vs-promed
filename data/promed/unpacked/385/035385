The Ministry of Public Health reports that 5 positive cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] have been registered in the [Salta] province from the beginning of 2021. Of those people affected by the virus, one death resulted.

The infected individuals are residents of the Oran Santa Rosa colony General Mosconi and Hipolito Yrigoyen. Of the patients, 3 are female and 2 are male. The epidemiological surveillance is the same as that followed for mosquito transmitted diseases. Given a nonspecific acute febrile disease, laboratory studies are being done for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, hantaviruses, and other arboviruses.

The Ministry of Public Health especially recommends to the population that lives in rural areas to keep their residences and untended areas clean in order to avoid the presence of rodents that transmit the hantaviruses, as well as block openings in doors, walls and around pipes where they could enter.

Hantavirus infection is a zoonosis, that is, it is a disease that is transmitted from an animal to humans. The transmitting agent of hantavirus is the rural mouse, which lives in environments such as cornfields, reed beds, forests and grasslands, not the urban rat.

For this reason, the community is advised to use poison or a trap for rodents, not to touch or hit them. If one of these animals is found dead, spray it with bleach and after at least 30 minutes collect it, using gloves, and bury it more than 30 centimeters [12 inches] deep, or burn it. After using poison, wash your hands well with soap and water.

In the event that it is necessary to accumulate firewood, do so as far as possible from the house; eliminate weeds on the land and avoid contact with rodent secretions.

Ventilate for at least 30 minutes before entering places that have been closed and cover mouth and nose with a wet cloth. Clean floors, tables, drawers and cupboards with a solution of water and bleach, in a ratio of 10 parts to one and leave for 30 minutes before rinsing. Moisten the floor before sweeping, so as not to raise dust, which may be contaminated.

If camping, do so away from weeds or garbage dumps, do not sleep directly on the ground, and consume safe water.

Hantavirus infection is a serious acute viral disease, which is transmitted by countryside mice, through their saliva, feces and urine and for which there is no vaccine

The most frequent cause of transmission is inhalation, when breathing in places where infected mice, through their secretions, have contaminated the environment with the hantavirus.

The disease [virus] can also be transmitted by direct contact, by touching infected live or dead rodents or their feces or urine. The least common form of transmission is the bite of mice.

The symptoms of hantavirus can be confused with a flu-like state, with the presence of fever, muscle pain, chills, and headache. These symptoms can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Later, there may be respiratory distress with serious complications. In the presence of any of these symptoms, especially if you have been exposed to urine, saliva or rodent excreta in the 6 weeks prior to the appearance of symptoms, you should see a doctor immediately.

General preventive measures:
- Keep the house clean to avoid the presence of rodents. Eliminate disused items that can serve as nests for mice.
- Prevent rodents from entering the house or making their nests in it, plugging all gaps of more than half a centimeter [1/4 inch] opening, both inside, especially where food is stored, and outside. Use steel mesh, cement or other resistant material.
- Locate vegetable gardens, barns and firewood storage far from the house, at least 30 meters [98 ft] away.
- Place firewood, tools, fodder, grains, etc., on 30-centimeter [12 inches] pallets and move them periodically.
- Do not use closed spaces that may be infested by rodents without previously ventilating them, opening doors and windows.
- Take special care when starting fans or air conditioners whose filters or ducts may have been in contact with contaminated dust, rodents or their excreta.
- Camp away from weeds and garbage dumps. Do not sleep on the ground; if possible, use a cot at least 30 cm [12 inches] high. If a tent is used, if possible, have one that has a floor.
- Construct storage structures in such a way that they prevent the entry of rodents and can be permanently ventilated.
- Avoid contact with rodents or their burrows.
- Keep the surroundings of the houses clear, clean and free of elements that can serve as food or for rodents to nest, such as waste materials, cardboard, firewood, straw, household trash.

[The hantavirus responsible for this case is not mentioned.

Cases of hantavirus infection have occurred before in Salta province. Cases of hantavirus infection with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from various parts of Argentina in recent years.

As noted in ProMED archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (in western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Marciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_); Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina; in the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba (in _O. forensi_); and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. chaoensis_). There is always the possibility of infection with Seoul hantavirus, widely distributed in the world in brown rats (_Rattus norvegicus_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these cases in the province, but Oranvirus is very likely. Individuals in the affected neighborhoods would be prudent to follow the recommendations that the Ministry of Public Health recommends above. - Mod.TY
