Members of the public are advised that there has been a recent increase in the number of deaths among the monkey population in South, Trinidad.

Laboratory testing by the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) has confirmed the presence of the yellow fever virus in samples obtained from the bodies of the dead mammals.

This was discovered amidst routine public health surveillance activities, which are usually conducted by the Veterinary Public Health Division and the Insect Vector Control Division of the Ministry of Health, to monitor the monkey population.

The yellow fever virus is transmitted to people mainly through the bite of an infected mosquito of the _Aedes_ or _Haemagogus_ species. Mosquitoes get the virus by feeding on infected primates (e.g., humans, monkeys) and then can spread the virus to other primates (human or non-human).

Through the ministry's expanded immunisation programme, the majority of the population has already been vaccinated against yellow fever. Nevertheless, persons are advised to review the yellow fever (YFV) section on their immunisation card to ensure that they have been vaccinated.

Anyone who has not received the shot against yellow fever should visit their nearest public health centre to do so, as soon as possible. It is especially important that children are kept current with their vaccination schedules. In fact, they should receive their yellow fever vaccine when they are one year old. A single primary dose of the vaccine provides lifelong protection.

The following groups of persons are especially at risk:
- veterinary personnel
- laboratory workers who routinely handle wild-type yellow fever virus
- agricultural personnel who frequent forested areas
- hunters
- forest workers
- adventure seekers (e.g., hikers and campers)
- Defense Force personnel
- persons residing in or near forested areas
- health workers that frequent forested areas
- persons who frequent forested areas

Anyone who develops the following symptoms should visit the nearest health facility or healthcare provider as soon as possible:
- fever
- headache
- jaundice (yellow discolouration of the skin or eyes)
- muscle pain
- fatigue

Severe symptoms include:
- abdominal pains
- bleeding of gums
- vomiting

Meanwhile, the public is advised that there has not been a human case of yellow fever in Trinidad and Tobago since 1979 and that there is no outbreak [in humans] at this time.

[The above report does not indicate how many dead monkeys were found or when, how many were tested, or the species of monkeys involved. ProMED has not received a report of yellow fever in Trinidad since 2009 (see Yellow fever - South America (11): Trinidad, monkeys, conf. 20090123.0294), when the virus was confirmed in 2 red howler monkeys. The report also indicated that in 1988, 1999, and again in 1995, yellow fever virus was found in monkeys there. However, there were no associated human cases of the yellow fever virus at that time, nor in the current situation. The above report indicates that the majority of the population on Trinidad has been vaccinated against yellow fever, but it does not state the percentage of individuals vaccinated. The finding of monkeys dead of yellow fever indicates that the sylvatic (forest) yellow fever virus transmission cycle is active currently, so anyone not vaccinated should become so.
