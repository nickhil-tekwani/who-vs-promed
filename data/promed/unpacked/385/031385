COVID-19 itself is not to blame for the mysterious hepatitis outbreak affecting children across the world, researchers insisted today [25 Jul 2022]. However, pandemic-era lockdowns may have played a role. Scientists pinpointed a usually harmless virus as being the main culprit for the unusual liver illness, which has sickened 200 youngsters in the UK and left a dozen needing transplants. Two separate studies concluded that adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) seems to play a "significant role."

The virus, which does not normally cause any illness, infects most Britons by the age of 10. But AAV2 cannot replicate without a "helper" pathogen, such as an adenovirus -- which usually just causes cold-like symptoms. Adenoviruses surged in line with the hepatitis cluster, which experts believe is because children had weaker immunity upon their return to pre-pandemic levels of mixing. Therefore, a UK Health Security Agency-backed team of academics believe dual infection with these 2 viruses may offer the best explanation for the outbreak. Until now, scientists have been flummoxed as to the root cause of the illness, with theories blaming COVID-19 itself or even a mutation in an adenovirus strain.

Overall, the 2 studies, which looked at dozens of children across the UK, found that 96% of children with unexplained hepatitis had "high levels" of AAV2. For comparison, just 4% of healthy youngsters tested positive for AAV2, and at much lower levels. Dr Antonia Ho, lead author for of the studies, said COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions led to "much reduced circulation of seasonal viruses." An "equilibrium" needs to be re-established now that youngsters are mixing in pre-pandemic ways, which has led to "different types of circulation" of viruses, she said.

Sufferers of the strange illness have mainly been under 5 years of age who initially experience diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain, followed by jaundice, the yellowing of the skin. Some have then been hospitalized with liver inflammation 1 to 11 weeks later, of which 40% are admitted to intensive care. The WHO has reported at least 1010 cases in 35 countries. Nearly 50 have required liver transplants worldwide, and 22 have died.

The pre-prints, which have not yet been peer-reviewed but are published on website MedRxiv, suggest AAV2 is involved in the hepatitis outbreak.

The 1st study, led by the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), examined 9 children, aged 4 on average, suffering from hepatitis in Scotland. They were all hospitalized between 14 Mar 2022 and 4 Apr 2022 and stayed under NHS care for 10 days, on average. None required liver transplants. DNA was extracted from blood, liver, stool, and throat samples and results compared against 58 healthy youngsters. AAV2 was detected in all 9 hepatitis patients but among no one in the control groups.

In a separate analysis, the researchers examined the genetics of the patients with hepatitis. They detected that nearly 9 in 10 youngsters with hepatitis (89%) had a specific human leukocyte antigen gene, compared to less than 2 in 10 (16%) in the general population. This finding may offer another part of the answer as to why some children have become seriously unwell, the team said. Professor Emma Thomson, a clinical professor and consultant in infectious diseases at the CVR and senior author of the Scottish study, explained: "The gene itself is important because it encodes a receptor which presents viruses or other pathogens to the immune system, and so this suggests that there may be a link to an immune-mediated cause of the hepatitis triggered by viruses." However, she said more studies were needed to confirm that this gene was involved.

The 2nd study, led by Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) and the UK Health Security Agency, looked at 28 children with hepatitis in Britain. Their analysis included liver samples from 5 children who required a transplant and blood samples from the remaining youngsters who did not. Nearly all of the children tested positive for AAV2. For comparison, AAV2 was present "only very rarely" outside this group -- among just 6% of healthy children and at "much lower levels." Sequencing of liver samples showed AAV2 was present and had spread within the organ.

Both studies ruled out that a recent or previous COVID-19 infection caused hepatitis.

Tests showed only 2/3 of hepatitis sufferers had COVID-19 antibodies -- similar to the prevalence among Scottish children at the time -- and the virus was not present in any of the liver samples. None of the youngsters had had a COVID-19 vaccine.

The researchers still don't know why the hepatitis outbreak is happening now. However, they said a peak of adenovirus infections in the general population after lockdowns "may have contributed." Scientists have long warned that COVID-19 curbs in place to stop the spread of the virus also stopped other infections from circulating in the population, leaving people with lower immunity against them.

Professor Thomson said AAV2 itself may be the cause, or it may be functioning as a "useful biomarker" of a recent adenovirus infection, which could be behind the hepatitis cases. She said: "There are many unanswered questions, and larger studies are urgently needed to investigate the role of AAV2 in pediatric hepatitis cases. We also need to understand more about seasonal circulation of AAV2, a virus that is not routinely monitored; it may be that a peak of adenovirus infection has coincided with a peak in AAV2 exposure, leading to an unusual manifestation of hepatitis in susceptible young children."

Professor Judy Breuer, a virologist at GOSH, said the results can "reassure parents concerned about COVID-19, as neither team has found any direct link with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data do, however, point to AAV2 in the liver [and/or] blood of cases as the strongest biomarker for the hepatitis," she added.

"Summary paragraph
An outbreak of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology in children was first reported in Scotland. Here we report a detailed investigation of 9 early cases and 58 control subjects. Using next-generation sequencing and real-time PCR, adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) was detected in the plasma of 9/9 and liver of 4/4 patients but in 0/13 sera/plasma of age-matched healthy controls, 0/12 children with adenovirus (HAdV) infection and normal liver function, and 0/33 children admitted to hospital with hepatitis of other aetiology. AAV2 typically requires a coinfecting 'helper' virus to replicate, usually HAdV or a herpesvirus. HAdV (species C and F) and human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B) were detected in 6/9 and 3/9 affected cases, including 3/4 and 2/4 liver biopsies, respectively. The class II HLA-DRB1*04:01 allele was identified in 8/9 cases (89%), compared with a background frequency of 15.6% in Scottish blood donors, suggestive of increased susceptibility in affected cases. Acute non-A-E pediatric hepatitis is associated with the presence of AAV2 infection, which could represent a primary pathogen or a useful biomarker of recent HAdV or HHV6B infection. Population and mechanistic studies are required to explore these findings further."

Importantly, the control groups were carefully chosen:
"Research investigation:
Control subjects were restricted to children recruited in the UK between January 2020 and April 2022. Three comparison groups were identified: Group 1, sera from 13 age-matched healthy children (10 male, 3 female; age range 3-5 years); Group 2, 12 children (8 male, 4 female; age range 1-4 years) with PCR-confirmed HAdV infection and normal transaminases (n=12); Group 3, 33 children (18 male, 15 female; age range 2-16 years) with raised transaminases who were HAdV PCR negative. Within Group 3, 15 children required critical care for ventilatory or cardiovascular support. There was no significant difference in age between cases and healthy controls, but some control samples were sampled earlier than case samples (January 2020-April 2022 versus March-April 2022). Children with HAdV infection with normal liver function were younger (median age 1.6 years; interquartile range (IQR) 1.1-100; 3.3 years, p<0.001), and children with deranged liver function and no adenoviral infection were older (median age 9.2 years; IQR 6.7-13.6 years, p=0.001), compared to cases."

AAV2 was previously reported in the UKHSA Technical Briefing 2 on 6 May 2022 (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1073704/acute-hepatitis-technical-briefing-2.pdf). The briefing stated that "AAV2 is a dependoparvovirus which is typically dependent on other viruses including adenovirus and herpesviruses to replicate. Non-pathogenic human infection is common, and latent virus may reactivate in some circumstances, again with no clinical consequence.

"The hypotheses which are under consideration to explain detection of AAV2 in metagenomic data are:
1. Upregulation of AAV2 due to adenovirus or another acute viral infection.
2. Upregulation of AAV2 due to liver injury.
3. Contamination (for example of a reagent). Laboratory contamination is now considered less likely given that AAV2 has been detected in 2 testing laboratories with the appropriate negative assay controls but remains a possible explanation.
4. Undetermined role in pathogenesis of the syndrome."

It has been known for more than 50 years that AAVs can be isolated from humans since Blacklow N R, Hoggan M D, Rowe W P. Isolation of adenovirus-associated viruses from man. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1967; 58: 1410-5; doi: 10.1073/pnas.58.4.1410. The children did develop antibodies against AA as well, but it is unclear what role AAV plays, if any, in human disease. The viruses have, however, begun to be used in gene therapy. The following is extracted from Hastie E, Samulski R J. Adeno-Associated Virus at 50: A Golden Anniversary of Discovery, Research, and Gene Therapy Success -- A Personal Perspective. Hum Gene Ther. 2015; 26(5): 257-265; https://doi.org/10.1089/hum.2015.025. [Citations can be found at the original URL. - Mod.LL]:

"Introduction/Historical Perspective
With the discovery of 'virus-like' particles in adenovirus (Ad) preparation by Bob Atchison (1) and M. David Hoggan, and Wallace Rowe (2) in 1965, the journey of a novel parvovirus began (3). Atchison tentatively referred to the virus as adeno-associated virus (AAV), and Rowe continued use of the name. Early experiments characterized a virus that replicated poorly, if at all, in human cells in the absence of Ad. However, it was clear that AAV was immunologically distinct from any known Ad antigen, and 3 serotypes were identified: AAV1, 2, and 3 (1). The following years saw progress in determining that the AAV capsid contained an ssDNA genome (4,5) that the genome contained inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) (6-8), and that these ITRs are structured as self-priming hairpins that act as origins of genome replication (9). Sequencing of the AAV2 serotype ITRs was complete by 1980 (10). Concomitantly, the latent state of AAV was observed at NIH when an Ad infection on a panel of cell lines resulted in the production of AAV. This led to the discovery that low numbers of AAV genomes were integrated into the host chromosome (11), thus establishing the foundation for using AAV as a gene therapy vector based on its lytic (co-infection with Ad), latent (establishment of persistence in the absence), bi-phasic life cycle.

"Basic Science
Also in the early 1980s, with all molecular biology experiments being conducted using AAV serotype 2, it was known that the AAV genome was packaged into preformed capsid proteins (12). Further, a transcription map showed 3 overlapping mRNA families from 3 promoters, p5, p19, and p40 (13,14). The genome appeared divided between left and right, and 3 capsids, VP1, VP2, and VP3, were produced from the p40 promoter on the right side (15). It was unclear what the left half of the genome encoded, but a replication function was predicted. What was known, however, was that the virus could be produced in excess of 100 000 particles per cell. This ability to produce high yields, the fact that AAV was not a pathogen, and that the virus could persist all encouraged further exploration of its use as a gene therapy delivery platform. Unfortunately, because AAV replicated in the presence of a lytic virus, there was no easy focus-forming assay for selection of isolated mutants. Molecular clones were needed, but the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) guidelines were not clear when it came to cloning AAV DNA into plasmids. According to Barrie Carter, a 1980 ASM meeting in Miami Beach convinced the NIH RAC that recombinant DNA viruses like AAV and Ad could be safely studied in BSL2-approved laboratories (16). Here, cloning of the AAV genome into plasmids became a reality, and isolation of wild-type (wt) AAV infectious clones became a major milestone for the field."

AAV2 is now approved for gene therapy for several rare genetic diseases in the UK and USA (Keeler A M, Flotte T R. Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Gene Therapy in Light of Luxturna (and Zolgensma and Glybera): Where Are We, and How Did We Get Here? Annu Rev Virol. 2019; 6(1): 601-621; doi: 10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015530).

Even with this new information in pre-peer reviewed form, it remains too early to truly assess what role the AAV2 pathophysiologically plays in this outbreak of severe hepatitis. The information certainly points away from active or previous COVID-19 having a direct role. Confirmatory AAV2 information would be useful from other countries. - Mod.LL]
