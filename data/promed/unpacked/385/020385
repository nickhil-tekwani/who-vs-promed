MALARIA - PAKISTAN (03): POST FLOODING RISK

Nearly 300 000 suspected malaria cases, including some confirmed cases of a
severe form of the disease, have been recorded in flood-affected areas of
Pakistan since the end of July 2010, with the overall incidence slightly
above the average seasonal outbreak, the United Nations health agency said
today [13 Oct 2010].

The UN World Health Organization (WHO) is supporting the Pakistan health
ministry's malaria control programme, as well as aid agencies working in
the health sector, to control the epidemic. The agency is coordinating the
deployment of preventive and curative measures.

Malaria is endemic in rural areas of Pakistan where there are 2 seasonal
peaks, in August, when the milder vivax-malaria is mostly seen, and
October, when the potentially fatal falciparum-malaria is common.

More than one million malaria cases are registered annually, but 12 per
cent of people living in rural areas are infected by malaria parasites
without showing symptoms of the disease.

Balochistan province has recorded the largest number of consultations for
suspected malaria, while an increasing number of cases are also being
reported in Punjab and Sindh provinces, according to WHO's Disease Early
Warning System and the ministry of health.

The rising number of cases is the result of the floods that have displaced
millions of people, forcing many into poor shelter, where they are exposed
to mosquito bites. Pools of stagnant water are ideal breeding sites for
_Anopheles_ mosquitoes, the malaria vector.

"The total number of suspected malaria cases reported in flood-affected
districts is only slightly higher than at the same period in previous
years. However, falciparum-malaria needs special consideration as it is
responsible for severe cases, and it can be fatal," said Guido Sabatinelli,
the WHO Representative in Pakistan.

Communicable disease surveillance of all epidemic-prone diseases has been
strengthened, and malaria experts are currently visiting Sindh, Punjab and
Balochistan provinces to assist the health ministry in conducting outbreak
investigation, training and other malaria control activities.

The United States Agency for International Development has donated USD 5
million, through WHO, for malaria prevention and control activities in
flood-affected districts of Pakistan. As part of its response, WHO has
provided 320 700 rapid diagnostic tests kits and procured 145 000
long-lasting insecticidal nets. The agency last week dispatched 55 000
arthemisine-based combination treatments (ACT) for falciparum-malaria and
30 000 primaquine tablets to treat vivax-malaria.
