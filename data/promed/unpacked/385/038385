The latest victim of a mysterious _E. coli_ outbreak in Nova Scotia is a
16-year-old boy from the [Halifax metro area. Test results received
Tuesday confirmed the teen had fallen victim to a potentially deadly strain
of E. coli known as 0157, Health Department spokesman Morris Green said
Wednesday.
Since late June, 16 Nova Scotians, almost all from the [Halifax metro
area, have been diagnosed with the illness, and there are about half a
dozen suspected cases.
Advanced testing performed at a Health Canada laboratory in Winnipeg has
shown that at least four of the Nova Scotia patients and three people in
New Brunswick were infected by the same source.
A case in Cape Breton [eastern end of Nova Scotia from late last month has
been shown to be unrelated. Testing is still being performed in the rest of
the Nova Scotia cases to determine whether they too are related. Teams of
health officials are trying to track down the source of the infection.
