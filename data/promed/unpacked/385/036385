Transplant patient got AIDS from new kidney
-------------------------------------------
A transplant patient contracted AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome) from the kidney of a living donor, in the 1st documented
case of its kind in the U.S. since screening for HIV [human
immunodeficiency virus] began in the mid-1980s. It turns out the donor
had unprotected gay sex in the 11 weeks between the time he tested
negative and the time the surgery took place in 2009.

In a report Thursday [17 Mar 2011] on the New York City case, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that
organ donors have repeat HIV tests a week before surgery. "The most
sensitive test needs to be done as close as possible to the time of
transplant," said Dr. Colin Shepard, who oversees tracking of HIV
cases for the New York City Health Department. The CDC also said
would-be organ donors should be told to avoid behavior that can
increase their chances of infection. Living organ donors in the U.S.
are routinely tested for infectious diseases such as hepatitis and
HIV. But the organization that oversees organ transplants in the U.S.
does not have an explicit policy on when such screening should be
done. That's left up to transplant centers.

Because of patient confidentiality, health officials released few
details about the donor, recipient, their relationship or the hospital
where the transplant took place, except to say that it is in New York.
Neither the donor nor the recipient knew he or she had HIV until about
a year after the transplant, according to the CDC report. The
recipient developed AIDS, perhaps because he or she was on drugs that
suppress the immune system to prevent organ rejection, while the donor
did not, health officials said. Both are receiving HIV treatment.
Their conditions were not disclosed in the report.

"We don't know how frequently this is happening and we need better
surveillance," said Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, a CDC official who co-wrote
the report. HIV infections in a donor or recipient may not be
discovered until long after a transplant, and even then, patients and
their doctors may not make the connection and report it, health
officials said. In this case, once health authorities were notified
late last year [2010], they spent months investigating whether the
transplanted kidney was the source of the patient's AIDS infection.
Genetic analysis of the virus confirmed investigators' suspicions.

At least one similar U.S. case has been reported in the media. An
Orlando,Florida, woman last year filed a lawsuit saying she was
infected with HIV through a 2007 kidney transplant from a live donor
in Florida. However, CDC officials said they have not been asked to
investigate and could not confirm the report.

Before that, Italian doctors reported HIV transmission from a live
organ donor in 1989. Since the 1980s, there has been a confirmed
report of a deceased donor's organs spreading the AIDS virus. That
happened in Illinois in 2007, when organs from a 38-year-old gay man
went to 4 recipients.

For many years, transplant organizations focused heavily on screening
organs taken from the dead, which accounted for the large majority of
transplants. But kidneys from live donors are becoming increasingly
common. In 1988, about 32 percent of kidney transplants came from live
donors. By last year, it was more than 46 percent, according to
federal data. Donors generally are relatives or friends.

About 88 000 people are on the kidney waiting list right now,
according the United Network for Organ Sharing, a nonprofit
organization that manages the nation's organ transplant system for the
federal government. The group is developing new nationwide policies
for live donors, spokesman Joel Newma said. Transplant centers have
teams that evaluate potential donors and look for physical or
psychological red flags.

But some would-be donors may find themselves in a quandary: They want
to save a loved one's life but are unwilling to reveal that they use
drugs, have gay sex or engage in other behavior that raises their risk
of HIV. Some donors may assume they will be tested for every important
kind of infection, and think it doesn't matter whether they disclose
their risky behavior, Kuehnert said.

CDC officials recommend a HIV test developed in the 1990s that is
more sensitive than traditional testing. The more sensitive test can
detect HIV within 10 days after the person is 1st infected. An older
test won't detect antibodies to HIV until 3 to 8 weeks after
infection. Yet the older tests are more commonly done.
