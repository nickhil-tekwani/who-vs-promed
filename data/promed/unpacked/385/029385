Lassa fever follow up in England
Follow up of contacts of the British aid worker with Lassa fever reported
last month in Eurosurveillance Weekly has been completed (1). The patient
died on 23 March despite intensive nursing and medical care in a hospital
infectious disease unit and, subsequently, in a high security unit.
Ninety-two people were identified whose level of contact was deemed to
qualify them for temperature surveillance for 21 days after exposure to the
patient or to his blood or body fluids, in accordance with national
guidance (2). The surveillance exercise has been completed and no one who
was monitored became unwell with Lassa fever.
After their level of contact with the patient was assessed, 10 people were
offered prophylaxis with ribavirin, seven of whom decided to take it. All
seven completed the course.
A report being compiled on the incident will highlight lessons learnt. The
Public Health Laboratory Service in London plans to host a meeting to share
experience of managing cases of Lassa fever in different countries in
autumn 2000.
