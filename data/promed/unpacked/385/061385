The Andhra Ponni (BPT 5204) [rice variety] has been affected by false smut in certain parts of [Tiruchirappalli] district [Tamil Nadu]. The disease has been due to the continuing foggy conditions. Although the Agriculture Department has been repeatedly advising farmers against raising Andhra Ponni, many farmers continue to go for the variety as it fetches a better price.

[The] farmers wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress demanded that the government ban the sale of the seeds of the variety. [The] Agriculture Department clarified that [it] has already stopped production and supply of seeds of the variety.

A senior official of the department said that the disease was not widespread. He also pointed out that the TNAU [Tamil Nadu Agricultural University] has brought [out] equivalent varieties which are suitable to conditions here and farmers should go in for the same.

[False smut of rice is caused by the fungus _Ustilaginoidea virens_ (taxonomically not a true smut fungus, hence "false"). The disease can reduce yield by up to 75 per cent and affects grain quality and seed germination rates. Large orange to brown-green fruiting structures on one or more grains of the mature panicle develop. Surface spores spread the disease to immature panicles. Disease development is favoured by high humidity.

So far, not much is known about the life cycle of the pathogen, including the time in the plant's growth cycle at which infection occurs. The "smut balls" survive between crops in the soil. In addition to causing yield losses, the mycotoxin ustilotoxin is produced by the pathogen and may be of concern in rice products. Disease management may include phytosanitation, cultural methods, fungicides and use of resistant cultivars.

In India, false smut outbreaks have become increasingly severe over the past decade. As mentioned above, available resistant varieties are not favoured by farmers, which makes disease control considerably more difficult.
