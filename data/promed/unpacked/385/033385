Measles Outbreak Among Young Adults in Australia
------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 16 Feb 2001, 31 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles have been
identified in Victoria, Australia. All but one of these (a 10 month-old
female) have been between 15 and 34 years of age. The previous measles
outbreak in Victoria affected a similar age group (ref. 1).
Young Australian adults born between January 1970 and December 1983 are at
greater risk of measles infection because they have either not had wild
measles virus infection or have not been adequately immunized.
Measles-containing vaccines were first available in Australia in 1968 and a
2-dose MMR (Measles-Mumps-Rubella) vaccination program was introduced in
1994. Very few of those within this age group are likely to have received 2
doses of a measles-containing vaccine (ref. 2). As with the 1999 outbreak,
the hospitalization rate among this age group has been high: 17 cases (57
per cent) have been hospitalized.
The primary case in the current outbreak was a 19 year-old male with no
documented history of previous vaccination, who had returned to Sydney on 4
Jan 2001 after spending a holiday in India. He visited Melbourne, Victoria
from 17 to 20 Jan 2001 during his infectious period. Onset of rash in the
primary case was 20 Jan 2001. Onset of rash in the remaining cases was
between 28 Jan and 13 Feb 2001. In total 8 cases have been directly linked
to the primary case, including the 10 month-old child who had attended the
same restaurant on the same night as the primary case. The 3 most recent
cases (rash onset between 9 Feb 2001 and 13 Feb 2001) appear to represent
the next wave of transmission. Of these 3, 2 are known to have attended the
same night club on the same night.
Measles virus RNA has been harvested from 13 of the cases by the Victorian
Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory. While initial analysis of the
virus strain places it within genotype "D," subsequent tests will allow
more specific genotyping. Virus culture in B95a cells has yielded at least
5 isolates and is ongoing.

[In general ProMED-mail does not categories measles as an emerging disease,
but individual reports are considered on the basis of their intrinsic
interest. In principle, we appreciate reports from official sources, and
hope that official sources will also send us reports of outbreaks of
emerging infectious diseases.
According to the standardized nomenclature recommended by WHO for
description of wild-type measles viruses (WER, 1998; 73: 265-272), 8 clades
can be discriminated by phylogenetic analysis, and are further divisible
into at least 15 distinct genotypes. Some clades are represented by a
single genotype, whereas others (such as clade D) contain multiple
genotypes (designated D1, D2...etc.). Further characterization of these
Australian isolates may confirm the inference that the virus was imported
into Australia by the index case. - Mod.CP
