Following the discovery of tuberculosis in hogs illegally imported from
Ohio, 4 West Virginia farms have been quarantined, Department of
Agriculture commissioner Gus R Douglass announced on Friday. "I am
exercising the powers granted to the Commissioner of Agriculture to ensure
that this disease does not spread to any animals in this state and to
protect consumers from products that could potentially sicken them,"
Douglass said.
The quarantine includes 2 farms in Putnam County and one each in Logan and
Greenbrier counties, agency spokesman Buddy Davidson said. Animals can't be
moved on or off the premises until further notice.
The form of tuberculosis carried by the hogs is transmissible to humans
through direct contact and through eating improperly cooked meat. Once
contracted, the respiratory disease may cause lesions inside the lungs.
There have been no reports of humans or other animals contracting the
disease. "We caught it in time," Davidson said. "This is not considered a
major human health threat," he said, adding that most people do not
contract the illness.
A Red House resident who is cooperating with the Department of Agriculture
brought the hogs into the state on 13 Mar 2006. The resident bought the
hogs in Hillsborough, Ohio, Davidson said. He did not know what type of
facility sold the hogs but said it was probably a farm.
Davidson said the hogs did not have health certificates verifying that they
had been tested for diseases and immunized. Health certificates are
required "to avoid just this type of situation," he said. "The resident did
cover all the costs of putting this right," Davidson said. "He went and
collected those animals, put them down and paid to dispose of them."
The agency has notified agriculture officials in Ohio, as well as in 3
other states because the resident sold one hog in Pennsylvania, 6 in
Kentucky and 14 in Virginia.
State food safety personnel discovered signs of tuberculosis on Tuesday in
hogs being processed at custom meat plants. This prompted Douglass to
activate the agency's Food and Livestock Safety Team. The team tracked down
all but 5 to 8 of the 200 or so suspect animals, Davidson said.
People who believe they have obtained these animals are advised to contact
Douglass' office as soon as possible, and to not eat the meat.
Some carcasses were still in the processing facilities and were immediately
condemned by the Department of Agriculture's Meat and Poultry Inspection
Division. Some had been processed and left the facilities, but all the
affected consumers were notified and none of the meat had been consumed,
Douglass said.
The remaining animals were killed and disposed of last Friday.

[Swine can contract bovine tuberculosis (_Mycobacterium bovis_) from direct
contact with infected cattle. Like cattle, swine may also contract the
avian form of TB -- _M. avium_ serotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 -- the serotypes
responsible for about 85 per cent of the swine tuberculosis in the US. The
Food Safety Inspection Service maintains active surveillance regarding
swine TB at slaughter. - Mod.TG]
