2 people have died from tick bites in Sverdlovskaya oblast
----------------------------------------------------------
From the beginning of the [2009] seas
on 10 733 cases of tick bites have been registered in Sverdlovskaya
oblast and in 119 cases tick-borne encephalitis has been confirmed. A
71-year-old man has died from this disease in Rege in May 2009. He
removed the tick himself and did not apply for medical help. The day
before, a 72-year-old man died in
Tavde. Neither case had been vaccinated.

The vice head of Sverdlovski oblast Rospotrebnadzor administration
Andrey Yurovskickh considers that in some cases the situation with
vaccination is "disgraceful." "This is shameful," he stated. Old
people and small children are not getting vaccines properly. Although
resourses for 7-year-old children are being allocated, retired people
do not get the vaccination. The plan for vaccination has been
completed by 21 percent. Acaricidal [anti-tick] treatments in parks
have been completed by 60 percent. Specialists forecast that ticks
will be more abundant this year (2009), compared with the last year
(2008).
