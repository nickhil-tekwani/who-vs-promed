- Wheat stem rust is present in south central Louisiana plots.
- Wheat leaf rust is widespread throughout the southern U.S.
- Wheat stripe rust is at low levels in the U.S. except for Louisiana
and California.
Winter wheat growth and development is ahead of normal crop
development, but many areas in the southern U.S. are dry and need
rain. In the spring wheat and oat area of the northern plains, warm
temperatures have allowed for an early start of fieldwork and planting.
Wheat stem rust
----------
In mid-April, soft red winter wheat plots at Crowley, in south
central Louisiana, had stem rust severities of 40 percent. Stem rust
was found in 28 of the 102 plots that are located near rice
paddies. The regular dew formation in these plots provided a
suitable environment for stem rust infections. This is the first
report of wheat stem rust in U. S. this year.
Wheat leaf rust
--------
By the 2nd week of April, susceptible cultivars like Jagelene and
Jagger in nurseries at Castroville and College Station, Texas had 80
percent leaf rust severities. In highly resistant cultivars like
Fannin and Endurance, no infections were found. Only low levels of
rust have been reported in southern and central Texas fields because
of the dry conditions. By early April, low levels of leaf rust have
been reported in Oklahoma. During the 2nd week of April, plots in
southern Louisiana had leaf rust severities up to 70 percent. In
early April, leaf rust was found on the lower leaves of the most
susceptible cultivars in southwestern and south central Georgia. By
mid-April, leaf rust was found in areas of Arkansas that had
sufficient moisture. Leaf rust incidence and severity will increase
in the next few weeks with periodic rainfall and dews throughout the
southern U.S. From rust collections made in early November in north
eastern Oklahoma plots, the following leaf rus!
t races were identified: TBBJ (Lr2a virulence), TDBJ (Lr24 virulence)
and TDDS (Lr17 & 24 virulence). From collections made in early
December in central Texas, the TDBJ (Lr24 virulence) race and in
northwest Arkansas the TBRK (Lr 11 & 18) race were identified. These
leaf rust races also were identified from rust collections made
during the 2005 survey (<http://www.ars.usda.gov/mwa/cdl>).
Wheat stripe rust
--------
In early April, only traces of stripe rust were found in southern and
central Texas (Fig. 2). Weather conditions have not been favorable
for rust development (limited moisture, warm nights and high daytime
temperatures). As of early April, no stripe rust has been found in
Oklahoma or states to the north. In early April, no stripe rust had
been found in wheat plots in southern Louisiana while high levels of
stripe rust were observed in northeast Louisiana plots. By early
April, stripe rust was increasing throughout Arkansas, but conditions
did not favor development of high rust severities. In early April,
stripe rust was found in southern Georgia. Wheat stripe rust
infection in the southern Great Plains and southeastern U.S. is at a
much lower level than last year on this same date. If conditions
remain unfavorable for rust development a reduced amount of inoculum
is expected for the northern regions of the U.S. For the past month
California has had cool and very wet conditions, which have been
favorable for stripe rust development. In early April, the
susceptible forage wheat cultivar Dirkwin had stripe rust severity of
30 percent in the Imperial Valley. Infections also were noted in
fields of Orita durum wheat in the Imperial Valley. Light infections
of wheat stripe rust were reported in the southern portion of the San
Joaquin Valley and more severe infections were reported from
scattered areas further north in the San Joaquin Valley and
throughout the Sacramento Valley. In some Sacramento Valley fields,
80 percent severities were found in hot spots. By the 2nd week of
April, nursery plots at Mt. Vernon (northwestern Washington) had 40
percent stripe rust severity. Rust also was found in some
surrounding fields. Wheat stripe rust was not found from central to
eastern Washington during the second week in April. Stripe rust will
develop later this year then last in most of the wheat and barley
producing areas in the eastern Pacific Northwest.

[There are 3 main rust diseases of the cereal crop plant wheat (bread
wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ and durum wheat, _Triticum turgidum_), all
caused by species of the fungus Puccinia: wheat stem rust (_P.
graminis f.sp. tritici_), wheat leaf rust (_P. triticina_ aka _P.
recondita f. sp. tritici_) and wheat stripe rust (_P. striiformis f.
sp. tritici_).
Severe losses due to wheat stem rusts have abated in the USA since
the 1960s due to effective resistance breeding. Severe losses are
still a possibility with leaf rust. The USDA Cereal Disease
Laboratory in St. Paul, MN publishes regular reports on cereal rusts
in the USA during the crop season. Each report gives detailed
state-by-state information, including a summary map, all in pdf file
format (see link to main article).
The third bulletin for 2006 contains the first report of wheat stem
rust in the USA this year, at Crowley in south central Louisiana. No
new races of leaf rust have been identified yet when compared to
2005. Unusually cold and wet weather in California has favored stripe rust.
