[As shown it is unlikely that the 1998 nvCJD UK total will significantly
exceed the annual figures for 1996 & 1997. Whether the numbers reflect a
stable plateau is difficult to say at this time, however attractive it may
be to want to do so.
Tom Pringle posted a list of the initial diagnoses for a series of 99 CJD
cases. This nicely demonstrates the problems of CJD diagnosis, and this is
a disease that has been known for many years. In my experience the
probabilities of correct 2nd & 3rd opinions are not always as Tom sees them
as patients should/may zero in on more competent expertise. Apply this
concept to nvCJD, obviously with some appropriate neurological
diseases/conditions for younger people, and one can readily appreciate how
it can be missed. - Mod.MHJ

They got it right in 9 cases out of 99. The other interesting point is how
dispersed the other diagnoses were. It wouldn't do that much good to get a
second opinion as 81% of the time both would be wrong. It would take 22
opinions to arrive at a 90% chance of one or more being right. Of course
you wouldn't know which one it was.
These figures are on the generous side because the data is restricted to
confirmed CJD, e.g., cases that went to the grave misdiagnosed were not
figured in.
