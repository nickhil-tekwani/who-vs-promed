Following the discovery of 8 dead monkeys in the municipality of
Zamora [Aragua state], the director of the College of Physicians
[professional organization of physicians] of Aragua state
corroborated the existence of a yellow fever [YF] outbreak in the
southern area of the state and warned of the [risk of] arrival of a
real epidemic catastrophe in the region, as the disease [virus] is
transmitted by _Anopheles_ mosquitoes and by _Aedes aegypti_, and
Aragua is an endemic area for both [species]. [This statement is not
correct. YF virus in its sylvan (jungle) cycle is transmitted by
_Haemagogus janthinomys_ and _Sabethes_ spp. mosquitoes, not by
_Anopheles_ spp. - Mod.TY]

Jose Trujillo, President of the College of Physicians of Aragua
state, indicated that the death of the monkeys in Aragua confirms
epidemiologically the presence of the disease [virus], and so warns
the responsible governmental authorities to carry out not only
epidemiological surveillance, but also control measures to control
this terrible disease.

In the judgment of the head of the organization of physicians, the
mortality of the monkeys is one of the indicators of activity of the
virus [that causes] this disease, designated as one of obligatory
reporting with the goal of avoiding the occurrence of outbreaks in
humans. "Fortunately, there are yet no human outbreaks, but with the
deaths of the 8 monkeys in Zamora municipality, Aragua state, the
outbreak of the disease is confirmed epidemiologically," [he said].

He pointed out that the epidemiological norms, which were activated
in endemic areas for the disease [virus] (Amazonas, Apure, Bolivar)
have not been complied with, which if [the disease is] not controlled
in time, can generate a real epidemiological catastrophe, especially
in Aragua, an endemic state of the agent that transmits [causes] the
disease.

It is worth remembering that the last incidence of the disease was
recorded in November 2002, in the populations of Casigua, El Cubo,
Municipio Jesus Maria Semprum of Zulia state, [and] an epizootic in
monkeys in Aragua, which has persisted until today, according to
information published on the website of the Ministry of People's
Power for Health [but see ProMED archives for 2005 below. - Mod.JW]

In Venezuela, yellow fever is present in 3 [sic] foci:

- San Camilo in Apure* [state], inactive since 1973 (although in
December 1995 death of a patient from Saravena, Colombia, was reported),
- the south side of Lake Maracaibo [Zulia* state], inactive since 1980, and
- Guayana which, after a period of silence since 1980, had an outbreak
in the Parima region of Amazonas* state in 1998, and
- a case in the Canaima region of Bolivar* state in 1999
[but see ProMED archive refs. below. - Mod.JW].

The last reported urban yellow fever occurred in 1918 in the
city of Coro, Falcon state.

[This report states that this YF outbreak is "epidemiologically
confirmed", but does not indicate if the death of the monkeys has
been laboratory confirmed as due to YF virus infection. Although it
is highly likely that the monkeys did die of YF virus infection,
laboratory confirmation is necessary to be sure that this is the
cause of death, hence, this outbreak is listed as suspected.

It is curious that this report does not mention the more recent YF
epizootics in monkeys, nor the human YF cases that have occurred in
several other states in Venezuela (see ProMED-mail archives below).
