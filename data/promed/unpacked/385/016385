Leaf blight disease has hit coconut trees in various parts of Vellore district [Tamil Nadu], especially in areas located along the Palar riverbed. Scientists had started to receive information on the leaf blight disease ('Pestalotiopsis palmarum fungus') from farmers from the end of April [2016].

Leaf blight disease was prevalent in parts of Kerala. It had spread to areas in Coimbatore, Erode, and Salem [districts of Tamil Nadu] and has now affected coconut crops in Vellore. In Vellore district, coconut was cultivated on around 22 680 hectares [about 56 000 acres].

The scientists have advised farmers to remove and burn the severely affected leaves to prevent further spread. The leaf blight disease appears in weak or neglected palms and it was necessary for farmers to ensure normal fertiliser application.

[Grey leaf spot (or leaf blight) of coconut and other related palms is caused by the fungus _Pestalotiopsis palmarum_, which is widespread in the tropics. Symptoms on coconut include small yellow leaf spots with grey margins, turning grey with brown margins as they expand; spots coalesce into irregular grey, necrotic patches leading to completely dried and shrivelled leaf blades which give a burnt appearance. Symptoms are more severe on older leaves. The disease reduces plant vigour and yield and may delay maturation of the tree and onset of fruit production.

Fungal spores are mainly spread by rain and wind. Cool, rainy weather and bad growing conditions of the host favour disease development. Disease management may include cultural methods (removal of affected leaves, improving nutritional conditions of trees) and sprays with copper fungicides. Susceptibility of coconut varieties to grey leaf spot varies, some dwarf varieties have been found to be tolerant (such as Cameroon Green and Orange Dwarfs).
