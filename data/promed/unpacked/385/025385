[The number of patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of encephalitis have climbed from 658 on 12 Jul 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive number 20120714.1201337) to 756 and fatalities from 129 to 146 as of 30 Jul 2012, a little over 2 weeks later. No etiological agent responsible for the above cases is mentioned in the current report, but the 12 Jul 2012 report indicated that at least 90 per cent of the cases were reported to be of an undiagnosed acute encephalitis syndrome that is caused by the viruses present in contaminated water, while remaining 10 per cent of cases were due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections. As is usual in these reports, no mention is made of the vaccination status of the population for JEV in Uttar Pradesh and Behar states, where these cases most commonly occur.
