Increases of suspected tick-borne encephalitis in Irkusk Oblast
---------------------------------------------------------------
Altogether 918 people, including 217 children, have sought treatment
for tick bites in the Irkutsk Oblast. During the same period of the
preceding year a total of 699 people had sought treatment for tick
bites. Most of the bites occurred in Irkutsk city, Irkutsk district,
Angarsk, and Usolye-Sibisrk. This information was provided by the
Irkutsk public health surveillance centre.

A total of 9 people, including 3 children, have been hospitalized
with a preliminary diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis. Another 4
people were hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of boreliosis
and 4 more with a diagnosis of tick-borne ricketsiosis. One case of
boreliosis and 2 of ricketsiosis have been confirmed.

During the course of a week 415 ticks were screened for pathogens,
and 23 were found to be carrying tick-borne encephalitis virus and 72 boreli.

[Russian public health service officials have associated the increase
in reports of tick bites with the onset of warmer weather and the
increase in number of people seeking recreation in the countryside at
weekends. Healthcare centres are offering vaccination against
tick-borne encephalitis virus infection, and by the end of May at
least 125 000 people, including 86 children, had been vaccinated.
This may not be sufficient, since Irkutsk is an endemic region, and
efforts are being made also to clear recreational areas of tick
infestation. - Cor.BA
