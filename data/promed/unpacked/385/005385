A total of 7 babies have died in the last 48 hours after being
infected by a contagious flu [virus] in a pediatric hospital in El
Bouni, in the province of Annaba.

This flu, which practitioners have diagnosed as severe bronchiolitis,
was detected shortly after the hospitalization of a baby from Tebessa
province. Mainly concentrated in the EHS [hospital for maternal and
child health] of El Bouni, which covers the provinces of Annaba,
Guelma, Tarf, Souk Ahras, and Tebessa, this contagious disease has
affected all hospitalized babies and those brought by their mothers
for ambulatory care.

The information, which spread rapidly, has upset the people of Annaba
and the neighboring provinces. Mestouri Monji, director of Health,
Population and Hospital Reform in Annaba, while avoiding mention of
an epidemic, confirmed that several babies had acute bronchiolitis
and that 7 of them had died.

"All steps have been taken to prevent this contagious disease from
spreading outside the walls of EHS hospital," he said. Early Tuesday
evening [16 Mar 2010], the condition of 2 other babies infected by
the same virus aroused strong concern. Specialized disinfection teams
are on site at the EHS.

[This report does not indicate if the virus responsible for these
infant deaths was A/H5N1, A/H1N1, or some other seasonal influenza
virus. [In fact the term "flu" may have been used loosely and the
illness may not be related to influenza virus at all. - Mod.DK]. The
WHO report of 15 Jan 2010 (cited in ProMED-Mail archive no.
20100119.0221) stated that, "In North Africa, limited data suggest
that transmission of pandemic influenza virus [A/H1N1] remains active
throughout the region, particularly in Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt."
The number of infant fatalities seems high, but denominator numbers
are not provided. Nor is there any information about contact with
sick or dead poultry that would suggest infection by the more serious
A/H5N1 virus.

ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information concerning
the specific virus involved in these cases.
