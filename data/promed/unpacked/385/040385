[The report of this new fatality associated with MERS-CoV infection brings the total number of fatal cases reported by Saudi Arabia up to 317. As the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases has not increased from the 749 reported as of 19 Sep 2014 (MERS-CoV (17): Saudi Arabia, new case, retrospective revision of case count 20140919.2788385), and on 17 Sep 2014 there was a newly confirmed case described as "Taif: 27-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker, currently admitted to hospital ward, history of pre-existing co-morbidities, no history of animal exposure," it is most likely that this current death occurred in this same case that was reported on 17 Sep 2014 (see MERS-CoV (16): Saudi Arabia, new case 20140917.2781992). The current reported case fatality rate for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia is 42 percent.
