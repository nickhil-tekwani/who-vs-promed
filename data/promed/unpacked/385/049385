Hundreds of people have possibly contracted the disease cholera in Wau Shilluk in Upper Nile State over the past few days, according to a UN report, which said the outbreak caused 7 deaths.

The UN coordination office in South Sudan stated in its regular update today [4 Jul 2014] that 246 suspected cases were reported in the area in a period of only 72 hours. The outbreak in Wau Shilluk prompted a "major alert" by humanitarian health organizations. The area hosts about 39 000 people displaced by earlier conflict. Aid workers have sent additional medical staff to the area, set up oral rehydration stations and hand-washing stations, and distributed soap and hygiene kits.

In total nationwide, 2613 cases of the disease have been reported as of 2 Jul 2014, with 63 deaths, making for a case fatality rate of 2.4 per cent, above the emergency threshold of 1 per cent.

"Though initially largely confined to Juba County [Central Equatoria State], the disease has spread, with outbreaks or alerts reported in 9 of 10 states," stated the UN report. The outbreak has spread quickly in Torit, the state capital of Eastern Equatoria State, and 11 suspected cases were also reported in the UN base in Bentiu [Unity State], where poor sanitary conditions increase the risk of the disease spreading.

[2] Unity and Upper Nile states

South Sudan's cholera outbreak is worsening with reports of outbreaks in overcrowded and unsanitary camps in Unity and Upper Nile states. There are now hundreds of suspected cholera cases in Bentiu [Unity State], Wau Shilluk [Upper Nile State], and Malakal [Upper Nile State], in addition to the thousands of cases in Juba [Central Equatoria State] and Eastern Equatoria State, according to the latest weekly situation report by the UN's Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

OCHA reported a possible outbreak in Wau Shilluk, Upper Nile State, where 246 suspected cases were reported in only 72 hours.

Aid agencies set up a cholera treatment center in Wau Shilluk, a small village about an hour downstream of Malakal where about 39 000 displaced people are sheltering, with oral rehydration and handwashing stations and distributed soap and hygiene kits.

Earlier this week [week of 30 Jun 2014], humanitarian agency Oxfam reported one case of cholera in the Malakal UN base. In the Bentiu UN base, there were 11 suspected cholera cases and one death. OCHA said samples are still being confirmed to see if it is indeed cholera.

OCHA said over 100 new latrines were constructed in Bentiu to improve sanitation in the congested camp, though they need nearly 500 more to reach the international standard of one latrine for every 50 people. The report said that cholera response supplies need replenishment in Eastern Equatoria and Upper Nile states, and that there are 9 cholera treatment centers in Juba, where nearly 2000 cholera cases have been reported since May 2014.
