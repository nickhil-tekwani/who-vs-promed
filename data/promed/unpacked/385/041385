----------------------------------------------------------------------
With reference to the recent posting on leishmaniasis in a dog in Uruguay I would like to comment as follows: Based on current guidelines, this dog should be treated with an established anti-leishmania treatment protocol. This is known to greatly reduce the parasitic load hence reducing the chances for this dog to act as a reservoir. Being aware of the public health concern, on welfare grounds I find it difficult to justify the fact that this dog will receive no treatment and is not allowed out of the house.

[This report is a follow-up on the previous OIE posting referenced above. We would like to thank Gian Lorenzo for emphasizing on the treatment and control aspects of the disease in the dog (the reservoir host), which was not mentioned in the OIE report despite the fact that it is a disease of public health importance.

However, it should be noted that the control of the disease in the animal reservoir is complex and frequently involves combined interventions. For example, the Brazilian Control Program recommends a strategy based on canine culling and vector control with insecticide spraying. Insecticide-impregnated collars for dogs and canine vaccination are not currently recommended as public health control measures. It is therefore, important to know if Uruguay has an established treatment/control protocol against leishmaniasis since this might differ from one country to another and from one region to another.

Human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases have also been reported from Honduras, Venezuela, Paraguay, and Argentina. Sporadic and/or import human or canine cases have been described in Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico, Costa Rica, and French Guyana. A geographically referenced database providing links to published literature about the spatial distribution of VL can be accessed on http://apps.who.int/tools/geoserver/www/ecomp/index.html; make your selections from the icons in the 'overlays' folder. - Mod .FE]

CDC summarizes the complex subject of prevention and control with the following (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/health_professionals/index.html):

Prevention and control of leishmaniasis is based on 2 major modalities: measures to decrease human exposure to sand fly bites and interventions to decrease the infection reservoir. However, the strategy for a given location must be tailored to the local epidemiology and ecology. Specifically, the best control modalities depend on the ecology of transmission (sylvatic or domestic), local sand fly behavior (sylvatic versus peridomestic; resting in houses versus resting in outdoor niches); and the local reservoir hosts (wild animal, domestic animal, or human).

For anthroponotic leishmaniasis, rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of patients decreases the infection reservoir. Theoretically, canine reservoir reduction should decrease transmission of zoonotic VL, but programs that focused on the culling of infected dogs have not proved highly effective, possibly due to inadequate sensitivity of diagnostic testing to detect infectious dogs and time delays between diagnosis and culling. For sylvatic foci of cutaneous leishmaniasis, eliminating rodent reservoir hosts in a buffer zone around human dwellings may decrease transmission.

For sand fly vector species that rest inside human dwellings, indoor residual insecticide spraying may be an effective intervention. Spraying usually needs to be repeated every 6 months. Use of insecticide-treated nets and other materials can be highly effective when the peak period of vector activity is late in the evening. Long-lasting insecticide-treated nets avoid the need for re-treatment, but the duration of their effect against sand flies under field conditions in endemic areas has not been evaluated. In areas of zoonotic leishmaniasis with a canine reservoir (_Leishmania infantum_), treated dog collars and other modalities to decrease sand fly biting show promise as interventions to decrease infection exposure for humans.

The use of insect repellent and insecticide treated clothing is advisable for travelers, but is usually not feasible for the populations at highest risk. - Mod.PC
