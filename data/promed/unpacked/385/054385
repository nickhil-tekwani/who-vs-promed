Ten cases of toxoplasmosis in children were confirmed in Lagoa Vermelha, in the Northern Region of Rio Grande do Sul. Health officials investigate the focus of the contamination.

Nine of the diagnosed children studied until last year [2018] were from the Duque de Caxias school. Analyses of the water and food from the school have not revealed any problems.

Last month [March 2019], the management removed a sandbox from the patio, where the children played. "They inspected all possible sectors, investigated all possibilities, and all was ok, everything is within the standard of normality," says the director of the school, Lucelia Sguarizi. "We are most interested in finding out where the focus is. We do not want any students being contaminated anymore."

One of the children diagnosed with toxoplasmosis is the 5-year-old son of a nursing technician. "For the past 2 months he reported that he had a headache, not every day, but often he was very tired," the mother describes. "It is a disease that can infect a large number of people, and this creates concern and leads us to take effective measures to avoid the favorable conditions for proliferation of the disease," she says.

Last year [2018], Santa Maria, in the Central Region [of Brazil], reported an outbreak of the disease, whose origins are still under investigation. More than 900 cases were registered.

The main suspect of contamination was the water. The then Minister of Health, Gilberto Occhi, said in June 2018 that this was the origin of the outbreak. The statement sparked controversy. The mayor of Santa Maria, Jorge Pozzobon, denied this could be the source.

As early as March 2019, the Health Secretary of Santa Maria, Francisco Harrisson, reported that water has spread toxoplasmosis. The following month, after the declaration, the state government issued a statement stating that the case is still being investigated, so far without conclusion.

[Several outbreaks of toxoplasmosis (infection with _Toxoplasma gondii_] have been reported from Brazil (see ProMED reports below). Felines excrete oocysts in feces which can remain viable in the environment, including fresh water, for months. Isolation of oocysts from water samples require special concentration techniques. A food source is another possibility as raw or undercooked meat containing _T. gondii_ tissue cysts is infective. - Mod.EP
