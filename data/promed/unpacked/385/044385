Researchers say they have counted more than 14 000 birds killed by
avian botulism along Lake Erie this year [2002], possibly the
deadliest outbreak since the disease was discovered on the lake's
shores 4 years ago.

Wildlife officials warned the toll in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio,
and Ontario [along the shores of Lake Erie - Mod.TG] is probably much
higher because agencies are only collecting a fraction of the birds
that die.

"I think what we have seen is the tip of the iceberg," said Ward
Stone, head of the New York Department of Conservation's Pathology
Laboratory.

The worst of the outbreak should be over because colder weather has
arrived and the birds most prone to botulism -- such as loons and
mergansers -- are migrating, said Eric Obert, a researcher with
Pennsylvania Sea Grant.

Scientists first discovered avian botulism on the shores of Lake Erie
in 1999. Researchers believe they caught botulism by feeding on
infected fish.

[There were similar die-offs in Lake Erie in 1998, 1999, and 2001.
The 2001 outbreak was found to be due to type E botulism.

The sporulating anaerobic gram-positive bacillus _C. botulinum_
elaborates 7 types of antigenically distinct neurotoxins, 4 of which
affect humans: type A, B, E, or rarely type F toxin. Types A and B
toxins are highly poisonous proteins resistant to digestion by GI
enzymes. Approximately 50 percent of foodborne outbreaks in the USA
are caused by type A toxin, followed by types B and E.

Type C botulism occurs principally in waterfowl and other birds
living in an aquatic environment and causes tremendous losses, most
notably in waterfowl in the western US. In addition to North America,
it has been reported in birds in Europe, South Africa, Uruguay, and
Australia. In the Great Lakes region, it was first identified in 1936
in ducks on Green Bay of Lake Michigan and in 1941 in Monroe County
marshes along Lake Erie. Type C is most often associated with
limberneck paralysis in birds.

Type E botulism is connected with consumption of fish and occurs
mainly in gulls and loons, and to a lesser extent in mergansers, mute
swans, grebes, and shorebirds. It now appears any birds or mammals
susceptible to botulinal toxin run a risk of becoming poisoned if
they scavenge dead fish. Evidence for this includes the
identification of type E toxin in a bald eagle, wood ducks, and
muskrats with fish remaining in their digestive tracts.

_C. botulinum_ spores are highly heat-resistant and may survive
boiling for several hours at 100 degrees C (212 degrees F); however,
exposure to moist heat at 120 degrees C (248 degrees F) for 30
minutes will kill the spores.

Toxins, on the other hand, are readily destroyed by heat, and cooking
food at 80 degrees C (176 degrees F) for 30 min safeguards against
botulism. Toxin production (especially type E) can occur at
temperatures as low as 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees F), i.e., inside a
refrigerator, and does not require strict anaerobic conditions.

Human illness from Type E is most often associated with improperly
smoked fish. Since the toxin is destroyed by heat, it appears that no
problem with botulism will result from eating cooked waterfowl. -
