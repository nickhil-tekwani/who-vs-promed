Indonesia confirms 92nd bird flu death
--------------------------------------
A 28-year-old woman from the outskirts of the Indonesian capital has
been confirmed as dying of bird flu, raising the toll in the nation
worst affected by H5N1 to 92, the health ministry said Tuesday [11
Dec 2007]. The 2 laboratory tests on the woman, who died on Monday
[10 Dec 2007] at a hospital in Jakarta, showed that she was infected
with the highly pathogenic virus, a statement from the ministry's
bird flu information centre said. A total of 2 positive results of
tests on blood and tissue samples from a victim are needed before
Indonesian authorities confirm a bird flu infection.

Muhammad Nadhirin, an official at the centre, said that a team of 5
experts had been dispatched on Monday to the victim's neighbourhood.
The team said that "the source of infection could be from poultry 100
metres away from the victim's house, but we're waiting for test
results on whether the poultry is infected with the virus," Nadhirin
told AFP. He said the victim, who had sold ornamental plants, bought
plant fertiliser from the neighbour which may have been contaminated
by the faeces of infected birds. No birds however had died in the
area in the past 6 months and the poultry appeared healthy, he added.

The victim lived in the satellite city of Tangerang, just west of
Jakarta, where 3 other bird flu deaths have been reported since
October [2007].

The latest Indonesian H5N1 death follows that of a 24-year-old man in
China's eastern Jiangsu province on 2 Dec 2007 from the same virus.
The man's father was also infected, raising fears of human-to-human
transmission, but there was no biological evidence of this, Chinese
officials said Monday [10 Dec 2007]. No reports of outbreaks in birds
had occurred in the province.

The World Bank said last week [3-7 Dec 2007] that international
donors had committed more than 400 million dollars to fight bird flu
at a conference on the virus in New Delhi aimed at devising ways to
tackle the disease. But the Bank has projected a need for 1.2 billion
dollars over the next 2 to 3 years to help countries fight bird flu.

Excluding the latest death, H5N1 has killed 207 people worldwide
since late 2003, though the number of deaths has declined from 79 in
2006 to 49 this year, according to the World Health Organisation's
official toll.
