"Democratic People's Republic of Korea, confirmed H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in poultry:

"On 19 Apr 2013, a decrease in appetite and egg production was noticed in ducks in one of 20 cages of a duck factory in Pyongyang. Soon after, other ducks in fattening cages also showed the same signs with some mortalities. Initially, these signs were thought to be due to a problem in the feed. On 2 May 2013, with increasing mortality noticed in the ducks, the Central Veterinary Station (CVS) was informed and some samples were sent for testing. Testing confirmed the samples to be positive for H5 HPAI. Follow-up testing with RT-PCR on 7 May 2013, confirmed the samples as positive for H5N1. More than 2000 adult ducks, 42 000 fattening ducks, and 129 000 ducklings (younger than 20 days) died or were culled. It is assumed that some ducks were free-range and might have had the opportunity to contact H5N1 infected wild birds.

"Disease control measures were strictly taken and appropriate biosecurity was strictly enforced. Public awareness activities for the factory workers and residents around, as well as an epidemiological survey, have vigorously been conducted, and to date [9 May 2013], no human illness due to H5N1 has been found. Delay in testing and confirmation was related to the lack of appropriate reagents. A request has been made to FAO and OIE to provide needed laboratory, field control support, and technical training support, so the country may be appropriately prepared for the next potential incursion of H5N1 HPAI. [9 May 2013, National authority].
Note: This is the 1st outbreak of HPAI since the H7N7 outbreak in February 2007 in the DPR Korea. In 2011, a number of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks were reported in the Republic of Korea".
