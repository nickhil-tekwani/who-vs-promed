FIRST FOOD-BORNE PATHOGEN SEQUENCED
February 26, 1999
Science, 283(5406), p 1243
Elizabeth Pennisi
_Campylobacter jejuni_ has, according to this story, become a major health
problem over the past 20 years, often passing from its natural avian hosts
to humans through undercooked poultry or contaminated water. Now, it has
become the first food-borne pathogen whose genome has been sequenced.
Microbiologist Brendan Wren of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London was
cited as telling the Microbial Genomes III meeting held earlier this month
in Chantilly, Virginia, that a team lead by Bart Barrell and Julian
Parkhill at the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, U.K., has determined the exact
order of the 1.64 million bases that make up the pathogen's genetic code.
The story says the sequence has already revealed how _C. jejuni_ might
evade immune system detection, information that might help researchers
develop vaccines to protect against the bacterium, which last year caused
nearly 300,000 cases of food poisoning in the United States alone.
It is also shedding light on an occasional aftermath of _C. jejuni_
infections: a temporarily paralyzing neuromuscular disorder called
Guillain-Barr syndrome, thought to be an autoimmune reaction touched off by
the bacterium. What's more, because _C. jejuni_ is a close relative of
_Helicobacter pylori_, which causes ulcers, comparing the two genomes
should help researchers better understand that pathogen as well.
The story says that microbiologists have found _C. jejuni_ difficult to
study because it grows poorly in the lab. But sequencing it proved much
less of a problem, taking less than 16 weeks from start to finish.
