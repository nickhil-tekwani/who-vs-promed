Two girls died of dengue and typhoid fever in Purok 3, Barangay
Alangilan, Bacolod City.
Salome Binas, city sanitation inspector, clarified though that the
cases are not as yet considered alarming.
Records at the City Health Office revealed that a total of 59 cases
of dengue fever have been recorded so far.
Francis Balsomo, assistant city health officer, also reminded
Bacolenos to maintain cleanliness in their surroundings to avoid
carriers of the disease from spreading.
Local health officials identified the victim as a 5-year-old. The
5-year-old girl's mother said her daughter was admitted to the
Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital at 8 p.m.
Monday but died the following day.
The victim, hospital records indicate, suffered from low blood
platelets (part of the body's blood system that assists in blood
clotting) which resulted to her death. Low blood platelet count may
result in severe bleeding and may lead to death.
This condition maybe caused by a dengue virus, which is [carried] by
a mosquito which usually breeds in stagnant water.
The girl is the 2nd person to have died of dengue in Bacolod in 2006.
The victim's parents have requested the CHO conduct a fogging
operation in their barangay to make sure that the residents will be
safe from dengue.
Balsomo said that people should rid their surroundings of possible
breeding places of mosquitoes especially during rainy season.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
confirmed an imported case of dengue fever today (1 Jun 2006) and
urged people to guard against the disease.
Case details are as follows:
Age: 36

Present Condition: left Hong Kong on May 30.
Travel History: The patient lives in Malaysia. He came to Hong Kong on 27 May.
Cumulative Total in 2006: 12

It is essential that people stay alert to the threat of dengue fever
and help in the reduction of mosquito breeding.
To avoid mosquito bites, they should:
* Put all used cans and bottles into dustbins with covers;
* Change water for plants at least once a week, leaving no water in
the saucers underneath flower pots;
* Cover tightly all water containers, wells and water storage tanks; and
* Keep all drains free from blockage.
Travellers should take the following preventive measures:
* Wear long-sleeved tops and trousers;
* Use insect repellent on the exposed parts of the body; and
* Use mosquito screens or nets when rooms are not air-conditioned.
* Anyone feeling unwell after returning from their trip should
consult a doctor as soon as possible and provide details of their
travel to the doctor.
The latest information on dengue fever in other places can be found
under "Outbreak News" on the Hong Kong Travel Health Service website
