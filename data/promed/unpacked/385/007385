Health officer issues hepatitis A warning
-----------------------------------------
Semi-dried tomatoes have been linked to several cases of people being
diagnosed with hepatitis A in Victoria this week. Victoria's chief
health officer John Carnie issued a warning on Friday evening [9 Oct
2009] advising people to avoid eating semi-dried tomatoes unless they
are thoroughly cooked. "People who may have semi-dried tomatoes at
home should not eat them unless they are thoroughly cooked, such as
in pizza and quiche. Restaurants and cafes should also follow this
advice," Dr Carnie said.

He said the recent spike in cases follows an increase in May [2009]
of hepatitis A cases in Victoria and South Australia [see: Hepatitis
A virus, semi-dried tomatoes - Australia: recall 20090522.1917]. The
Department of Health and Human Services has received 12 hepatitis A
notifications this week and several people infected have reported
eating semi-dried tomatoes.

"At this stage we are unclear as to why there has been a recent spike
in cases in Victoria," Dr Carnie said. "We are also working with the
Victorian manufacturers to try to identify the source."

Hepatitis A [virus infection] is spread when traces of faecal matter
containing the virus contaminates the hands, objects, water or food
and is then taken in by the mouth. Symptoms of the disease include
abdominal pain, nausea, fever, chills and jaundice. Anyone
experiencing these symptoms should contact their GP [general
practitioner; doctor] or Nurse on Call.
