25 people have now tested positive for salmonella linked to contaminated mayonnaise served at 40 Melbourne Cup functions, including 11 who needed hospital care. Three people are still in hospital. The contamination, revealed on Thursday, 14 Nov 2013, contributed to the death of a 77 year old woman.

A further 165 people are suspected of having been poisoned after reporting symptoms, according to Metro North public health unit director Dr Susan Vlack. Health officials say up to 700 people could have been exposed to the bacteria.

Piccalilli Catering said it was the company at the centre of the scare, blaming eggs from a wholesaler it has since dumped.

[The serotype of _S. enterica_ involved has not been stated. With the initial report of 220 affected individuals, the number should be about 385 at this reporting. With 40 functions affected, it makes it more possible that some cases have returned from Brisbane, where the catered functions were located. The sites were not in Melbourne, Victoria, where the Cup was run. For our readers' information, the race was won by Fiorente, an Australian-trained horse. - Mod.LL
