According to the Institute of Health Surveillance (INVS), more than
2000 cases of measles have been reported in France since the beginning
of 2010, compared with 1544 in 2009. Ten percent of the cases have
been children in their 1st year of life.

The measles outbreak in France is intensifying, particularly in Lille
and near Bordeaux. Several outbreaks of measles virus infection were
observed similarly in early 2010 throughout Europe (Bulgaria, Spain,
Ireland, Germany), but France is a country of highest impact,
according to the INVS.

Elsewhere, many cases and deaths have been reported in developing
countries including Malawi, Burkina Faso, South Africa and Chad, where
the disease had appeared to have been under control thanks to
vaccination campaigns.

Remember that measles can cause complications causing severe brain or
lung damage in 5-10 percent of cases, especially among children under
one year of age. The INVS emphasizes that vaccination against measles,
mumps and rubella (MMR) is highly recommended for all toddlers.

[The source of this information appears to be the report of the
Institut de Veille Sanitaire dated 24 Jun 2010. This document contains
a detailed breakdown of the data by region and age. Between January
2008 and 31 May 2010, 4120 cases of measles have been recorded in
France. Few cases were reported previously during 2007. The incidence
of confirmed cases was 0.95/1000 in 2008 (604 cases), rising to
2.5/1000 cases in 2009 (1544 cases). During the 1st 5 months of 2010,
there have already been 1972 cases registered.

During the 1st 5 months of 2010, the virus has circulated throughout
most of metropolitan France. The number of cases reported during this
period exceeded 15 cases per 100 000 in 5 departments: Vienne (22.4),
Aveyron 19), Loire-et-Cher (17.4), Gers (15.2) and Loire-Atlantique
(14.5). In contrast, 19 departments and 3 overseas territories
reported no cases. The median age of the cases (at 1 Jan 2010) is 15
years (range: 0-86).

The above data are presented in detail in tabulated and graphical
form, and summarized in the form of a convenient colour-coded map.
Interested readers should view the text of the full report for further
information on severity of illness and vaccination status of patients.
