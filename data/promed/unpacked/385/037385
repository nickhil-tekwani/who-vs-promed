Abstract
--------
Consumption of unpasteurized milk in the United States has presented a public health challenge for decades because of the increased risk of pathogen transmission causing illness outbreaks. We analyzed Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System data to characterize unpasteurized milk outbreaks. Using Poisson and negative binomial regression, we compared the number of outbreaks and outbreak-associated illnesses between jurisdictions grouped by legal status of unpasteurized milk sale based on a May 2019 survey of state laws. During 2013-2018, 75 outbreaks with 675 illnesses occurred that were linked to unpasteurized milk; of these, 325 illnesses (48%) were among people aged 0-19 years. Of 74 single-state outbreaks, 58 (78%) occurred in states where the sale of unpasteurized milk was expressly allowed. Compared with jurisdictions where retail sales were prohibited (n = 24), those where sales were expressly allowed (n = 27) were estimated to have 3.2 (95% CI 1.4-7.6) times greater number of outbreaks; of these, jurisdictions where sale was allowed in retail stores (n = 14) had 3.6 (95% CI 1.3-9.6) times greater number of outbreaks compared with those where sale was allowed on-farm only (n = 13). This study supports findings of previously published reports indicating that state laws resulting in increased availability of unpasteurized milk are associated with more outbreak-associated illnesses and outbreaks.

Discussion
----------
Our findings support those from previous studies that access to unpasteurized milk leads to more outbreaks than pasteurized milk despite far less consumption of unpasteurized milk by the population (1,2,8,18). This has continued to be a public health challenge in the United States despite persistent recommendations against the practice (1,2). Although the mean number of outbreaks has increased over time, the mean number of illnesses per outbreak (outbreak size) has not increased. This might be a result of laws that prohibit interstate sale and distribution of unpasteurized fluid milk for direct human consumption. This could also be influenced by changes in outbreak detection and response over time. Furthermore, prohibiting interstate sale might limit outbreak size only to those with access, and expansion of sale beyond state lines could increase the number of outbreaks and outbreak size.

Outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk in this analysis disproportionately affected younger people, with over half of illnesses occurring in people aged 19 years and younger. Children are at greater risk for severe infection and might not make dietary decisions for themselves. Educating parents and caregivers about risks of outbreak-associated illnesses linked to unpasteurized milk consumption among children may help prevent consumption and reduce illnesses among this population.

In our analysis, _Campylobacter_ was the pathogen responsible for the most reported outbreaks and outbreak-associated illnesses linked to unpasteurized milk consumption and one of 2 reported deaths. The number of reported _Campylobacter_ outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk decreased during 2013-2018. Additional data are required to determine if this indicates a true and consistent decline in the number of outbreaks associated with unpasteurized milk or if this is an artifact of under-reporting. Prior to 2020, studies have reported an increase in the incidence of foodborne _Campylobacter_-associated outbreaks and illnesses in the United States (22,24), and unpasteurized dairy is among the most common vehicles for these outbreaks and illnesses (22,23). As such, continued surveillance will be important for understanding how the number and characteristics of outbreaks associated with unpasteurized milk changes over time.

Outbreaks linked to unpasteurised milk can be difficult to identify and trace to a production source. As part of unpasteurized milk sales agreements (such as herd shares), customers may not report product consumption and may withhold information about the source of the milk, which prevents traceback and implementation of farm-level interventions (25). In this analysis, traceback information was available for a small fraction of the outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk; however, when traceback activities were conducted based on available information, 36% resulted in product recalls. Recalls can remove contaminated food products from circulation, reduce illnesses, and stop outbreaks. Traceback to farms is critical to conducting case finding through purchase records or customer lists and implementing disease prevention measures such as basic sanitation, hygiene, and education regarding potential routes of milk contamination. Without traceback, ability to prevent additional illnesses or stop outbreaks might be limited.

In our analysis of outbreaks based on state laws, 78% of outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk occurred in states where the sale of unpasteurized milk was expressly allowed in retail stores, on farms and/or in farmers markets, or in states that expressly allowed herd shares. This finding is consistent with findings from other studies (1,2). We also found that among states where sale of unpasteurized milk was allowed, those that allowed retail sale had significantly more outbreaks than states where only on-farm sale was allowed. This suggests that greater access to unpasteurized milk through retail sale increases outbreak occurrence.

Outbreaks were also reported in states that prohibited the sale of unpasteurized milk. Possible explanations for this include the state law neither expressly prohibited nor expressly allowed herd shares, people consumed unpasteurized milk labelled and sold as pet food, there were illegal sales of unpasteurized milk occurring in these states, or individual consumers crossed state borders to purchase unpasteurized milk in states where sale is legal (1,26). Another explanation is the recent increasing availability of online purchasing options (6). Although prohibited under federal law, these types of online sales are not generally addressed by state laws (13). Online platforms are one method individuals report using to obtain unpasteurized milk (6). During outbreak investigations, it is important to include questions about online platforms when conducting traceback for potential purchase locations.

Our legal analysis identified 9 states where laws were amended to increase access to unpasteurized milk, either by allowing sale where it was formerly prohibited or by expressly allowing herd shares. In 2 states, Utah and Illinois, where laws changed to expressly allow herd shares, there was an increase in reported outbreaks after these amendments were made. It is important to monitor changes in states' laws and identify states that expand legal access to unpasteurized milk. In these states, public health officials might anticipate an increase in outbreaks and subsequent increases in the costs associated with investigations. Public health officials, in collaboration with physicians, veterinarians and agriculture officials, should increase awareness of all aspects of the health and economic impacts of more permissive sale of unpasteurized milk.

During the 1998-2018 timeframe when the trend analysis was conducted in this study, changes occurred in the process of outbreak reporting including the establishment of NORS [CDC's National Outbreak Reporting System] in 2009 (27). Collection of additional data elements through NORS has improved the ability to describe and prevent foodborne disease outbreaks at national and state levels through the collection of detailed information about the foods and pathogens that pose the biggest risk to human health (27). These reporting changes can introduce surveillance artefacts that we might not be able to account for in our analysis. These may include changes in reported mode of transmission classification (foodborne to another mode), which have been demonstrated in other studies (27). Furthermore, NORS is a voluntary reporting system, and there might be variability among jurisdictions investigating and reporting illness outbreaks, which could influence the numbers of outbreaks identified and reported for each state (28). Additionally, most illnesses arise sporadically rather than as part of recognized outbreaks and are less likely to be attributed to a specific food or other exposure, thus potentially underestimating the true burden of disease linked to unpasteurized milk and other food vehicles (29,30).

Finally, our analyses comparing outbreak number and outbreak-associated illnesses between states based on legal status did not control for true population at risk (i.e., those who drink unpasteurized milk) within each jurisdiction because this information is not collected through NORS. Contextualizing the number of outbreaks and outbreak-associated illnesses with the total number of consumers at risk in each state could help assess if the observed rates of illness are influenced by the size of the exposed populations and not merely the legal status of the states in which they reside. Additional research evaluating the total number of servings consumed by consumers in a given time period would also enhance analysis of risk, though these data are not currently uniformly collected.

The consumption of unpasteurized milk has been connected to sporadic illnesses caused by less common pathogens such as _Brucella_ spp. and _Coxiella burnetii_ (31,32). Given the severity and long-term health impacts of pathogens such as _Brucella_ and _Coxiella burnetii_, future analyses might consider assessing the additional impact of sporadic illness associated with consumption of unpasteurized milk. In addition to maintaining surveillance activities for outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk, it is important that surveillance and outbreak reporting systems monitor for pathogens not previously known to be transmitted through unpasteurized milk and for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

Our legal analysis of changes to state laws during 2012-2018 has at least 2 intrinsic limitations. First, only laws identified in the original cross-sectional assessment were reviewed for amendments made during the study period; other relevant laws predating the 8 May 2019 collection date, but no longer in effect as of that date, may be relevant. Second, the availability of historical amendments to state regulations varies across jurisdictions, hampering uniform comparisons. We also note that, while outside the scope of this study, many state laws contain detailed requirements for licensure, permitting, certification, labelling, or marketing unpasteurized milk products. Future examination of these parameters may be useful in further establishing an association between state laws on unpasteurized milk and foodborne disease outbreaks.

In conclusion, we find that access to unpasteurized milk continues to result in outbreaks in the United States. Most outbreaks occurred in states where the sale of unpasteurized milk is expressly allowed by law, and children were more affected compared with other age-groups. Pasteurization is a critical step in eliminating pathogen contamination of milk, even when good sanitation practices are in place. Continued partnership between state and federal government is needed to coordinate outbreak investigation activities, to report outbreaks linked to unpasteurized milk, and to monitor for changes in state policy that may impact public health. Finally, in states that are considering expanding legal access, especially retail access, to unpasteurized milk there is a need for enhanced education and awareness regarding potential increases in illnesses and the resulting burden and costs for public health systems.

In a previous publication in the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al. Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-391; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60%) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. A total of 65 (54%) involved cheese (42% made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 (46%) involved fluid milk (82% involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp. were responsible for 54% of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp. (22%), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13%), _Brucella_ spp. (4%), _Listeria_ (4%), and _Shigella_ spp. (3%).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14%), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to both articles for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ spp., _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ spp., _Yersinia_ spp., _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp., _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL
