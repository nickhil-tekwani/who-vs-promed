Raccoons dying in large numbers because of virus outbreak
----------------------------
El Paso County (Colorado) residents were being warned to get up-to-date
shots for their pets because of a virus that has killed about 200 raccoons
this year. The epidemic of distemper is the biggest Division of Wildlife
officials have seen in years. It can spread among skunks, squirrels, foxes,
and even dogs and cats.
Since spring and as recently as this week, the wildlife division has
responded to reports of dead raccoons in several areas in El Paso County,
including Fountain, Black Forest, and Shooks Run creek on the west side of
Colorado Springs.
"It's kind of like the flu among humans," said Michael Seraphin a division
spokesman. "It can be transmitted very easily, only in this case it's going
from raccoon to raccoon, and it's fatal."
Usually, the disease, known specifically as canine distemper, occurs every
few years in the spring. It rarely extends into the fall, and never before
has it killed so many raccoons, Seraphin said.
Officials are worried because raccoons' immune systems get weaker as winter
approaches. The virus usually spreads from animal to animal through direct
contact with body fluids, scratching, clawing, or biting. The wildlife
division describes the disease as nature's way of balancing raccoon
populations when their numbers get too high.

[Clinical signs of distemper include dyspnea, ataxia, clonic convulsions,
spasms of the hind legs, ascending paralysis, progressive blindness, loss
of appetite, emaciation, diarrhea, and coma. There is an excellent
discussion of the disease in raccoons in the archived file "Canine
