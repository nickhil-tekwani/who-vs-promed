Outbreak description
--------------------
On 14 Nov 2007, a general practitioner in the Nijmegen region of the
Netherlands called the Municipal Health Service (MHS). He reported 3
patients complaining of high fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, and
headache, all of whom had visited a bird show in the rural town of
Weurt (village of Beuningen). The bird show, organised by the local
bird society, took place between 31 Oct and 4 Nov [2007]. The birds
arrived on 31 Oct [2007] at the show's premises and were inspected
for the contest on 1 Nov. In the following days, the show was open to
the public. According to the organisation committee, about 200
people, mainly members of bird societies in the region of Nijmegen
and their families, visited the show.

On 15 Nov [2007], it became clear that at least 18 people, all
connected to the local bird association, had become ill with the
symptoms mentioned above after visiting the show; 7 of them were
hospitalised. On 16 Nov, one of 2 sputum samples and one of 6 throat
swabs that had been taken from 6 of the hospitalised patients tested
positive for _Chlamydophila psittaci_ in real-time PCR (polymerase
chain reaction). The 2 positive samples stemmed from 2 different
patients.

In a nearby village, a bird show scheduled for the weekend of 17-18
Nov [2007] was cancelled as a precautionary measure.

Case finding
------------
In close cooperation with the local bird society, the MHS actively
traced visitors who fell ill after attending the bird show. Based on
clinical presentation, date of illness onset, and the common exposure
of these patients at the bird show, a cluster of _C. psittaci_
infections was suspected. For further case finding, the following
case definition was used: a person who visited the bird show on any
day between 31 Oct and 4 Nov [2007] and developed, 5 days or more
after attending the show, at least 2 of the following symptoms: fever
of over 39 deg C (102.2 deg F), headache, muscular pain (shoulder,
neck), coughing, shortness of breath, cold shivers or sweating, and
gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea).

Regional general practitioners and specialists were informed about
this cluster of probable psittacosis. They were advised to perform
laboratory diagnosis (throats swab and serology) and to start
treatment (200 mg doxycycline for 10 days) in patients that matched
the case definition.

People who had visited the show were informed of the outbreak in a
letter that recommended timely consultation of a physician if they
had developed symptoms. In cooperation with the Food and Consumer
Product Safety Authority (VWA), source and contact tracing of the
birds was launched. Faecal samples of all birds that were exhibited
at the bird show were taken and tested for _C. psittaci_.

Results
-------
By 30 Nov [2007], 25 cases had been registered. Figure 1 [available
at the source URL] shows the epidemic curve of this outbreak to date.

Among people who had prolonged contact with the birds, such as the
organisers of the show, jury members, or members of the society
(referred to as 'members' in the figure), the attack rate was higher
(39 percent [19/49]) than among persons who only visited the show
(estimated attack rate 3 percent [6/150]; referred to as 'visitors'
in the figure). So far, 3 (12 percent) of the 25 reported cases have
been laboratory-confirmed by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction). Serological confirmation of _C. psittaci_ infections
by ELISA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay IgM or IgG are pending.

The VWA took samples of all birds that were exhibited during the show
(parakeets, finches, canaries, and several other types of bird). A
total of 74 pooled samples were taken from approximately 300 birds.
_C. psittaci_ was detected by RT-PCR in the birds of one owner, who
was one of the 7 hospitalised patients. The test results of the birds
of a second owner, who was not ill, were unclear. Faecal samples of
other birds were negative for _C. psittaci_. The VWA informed the
owners of the infected and possibly infected birds of the test
results on 23 Nov [2007]. Birds that may have carried the bacteria
are now being individually sampled and subsequently treated with
doxycycline.

Discussion
----------
In the Netherlands, between 30 and 70 cases of psittacosis are
notified annually. If left untreated, psittacosis can have serious
complications, such as severe pneumonia. People may become infected
after contact with infected birds as a result of their occupation
(for example, pet shop employees, bird breeders, poultry
slaughterhouse workers), hobby, or incidental contact. Most cases of
psittacosis are sporadic, and outbreaks are rarely reported [1-5]. A
paper on a large outbreak of psittacosis in a veterinary teaching
hospital in the Netherlands has recently been published [5].

Surprisingly, the faecal samples of only a few birds were positive in
the current outbreak. This could have been caused by intermittent
shedding of _C. psittaci_. Furthermore, it has been shown that birds
shed more bacteria during stress [6]. Increased shedding might thus
have occurred because of the stressful situation during the bird show.

Genotyping of the _C. psittaci_ cultivated from human cases and birds
will be performed. A retrospective cohort study has been launched.
All visitors to the bird show have been invited for serological
screening and to complete a questionnaire in order to get a better
estimate of the attack rate and help clarify possible risk factors
associated with infection.

[2] Brazil: (Rio Grande do Sul), smuggled wild birds
Date: Thu 13 Dec 2007
From: Breno Santos <breno@ghc.com.br>


Today [13 Dec 2007], the Epidemiologic Surveillance Department
(Municipal Health Secretariat) of the city of Porto Alegre RS [Rio
Grande do Sul state], Brazil, issued a brief report acknowledging the
occurrence of a microepidemic caused most probably by _Chlamydia
[Chlamydophila] psittaci_ ([the organism that causes] psittacosis)
that has affected so far highway patrol officers, veterinarians and
relatives that had [contact with] smuggled wild birds.

The [incident] began on 30 Nov 2007 with the apprehension of 481
birds, 450 of them "caturritas" or monk parakeet (_Myiopsitta
monachus_, Boddaert, 1783) by highway patrol officers in a routine
check.
(<http://zerohora.clicrbs.com.br/zerohora/jsp/default2.jsp?uf=1&local=1&source=a1693583.xml&template=3898.dwt&edition=8872Â§ion=67>).
The police officers found the birds in cages in the trunks (boots) of 2 cars.
[Some of the surviving birds were] distributed to a veterinary
hospital, a pet shop, a local zoo and a wild animal park in the
[environs] of the city. After a little more than one week, at least 15
veterinarians began to complain of headache, cough, body soreness, and
fever
(<http://zerohora.clicrbs.com.br/zerohora/jsp/default2.jsp?uf=1&local=1&source=a1704349.xml&template=3898.dwt&edition=8941Â§ion=67>),
[and] today [13 Dec 2007] the same newspaper reported that the police
officers responsible for [apprehending the smugglers] are
hospitalized [for] the same symptoms.

As of today [13 Dec 2007], at least 27 people have sought medical care
[for] the same symptoms and were reported to the local health authority.
All the affected persons are [reported to be] doing well after being
treated with antibiotics (mainly azithromycin).

The 1st report above is a detailed follow-up of the outbreak of
now-confirmed psittacosis (also called parrot fever or ornithosis)
that ocurred following a bird show in the Netherlands in November
2007. The preliminary report was previously posted in ProMED-mail
20071203.3891, where a more detailed description of the disease can
be found. The clinical attack rates in the Netherlands, as expected,
were correlated with the degree of exposure: 39 percent among
bird-handlers and 3 percent among visitors to the bird show.
Serologic testing of asymptomatic individuals involved in the bird
show is still pending.

Both the outbreak in the Netherlands and in Brazil occurred in
relation to transport of birds, an event that is known to increase
shedding of _Chlamydophila (formerly Chlamydia) psittaci_, the
organism that causes psittacosis. More cases among those in contact
with the infected birds in Porto Alegre can be anticipated. The
treatment of choice for psittacosis in humans is doxycycline,
although azithromycin is an acceptable alternative. Infected birds
should be treated with tetracycline or doxycycline for 45 days. -
