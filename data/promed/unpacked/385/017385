For a brief time at the turn of the millennium, few things might have scared the average New Yorker more than the words "West Nile," the name given to the mosquito-borne virus that, in 1999, began killing birds and eventually people for the very 1st time in the USA.

Then, 2 decades later, the worst fears sparked by West Nile hysteria haven't come to pass. The initial outbreak in New York, which infected at least 59 people and killed 7 wasn't the work of bioterrorists. There were never massive outbreaks of West Nile that arrived on deadly wings like clockwork every summer, nor did droves of people horrifically die from having their brains infected and cooked from the inside out.

But despite dedicated mosquito spraying and surveillance efforts, the virus has thrived exceptionally well in the country. It was first discovered in Uganda in 1937, it's now the most common mosquito-borne disease in the USA, with cases regularly seen in all 48 landlocked states.

Along the way, it has periodically decimated bird and horse populations, sickened at least 50 000 people (millions of people have probably been infected, but only a minority experience symptoms), caused devastating neurological illness in 25 000 people, and killed over 2000 people. And scientists have called West Nile [virus]'s arrival in the USA one of the most important events in the world of arbovirology ("arbo" meaning spread by an insect or arthropod) to have happened in the past 2 centuries.

In recognition of West Nile's 20th anniversary in the US, Gizmodo interviewed Laura Kramer, director of the Arbovirus Laboratory at the New York State Department of Health [and Moderator LK for ProMED-mail].

Kramer is one of many experts who have contributed to a retrospective on West Nile that is published today [25 Sep 2019] in the Journal of Medical Entomology. She was also one of the 1st scientists brought in by the local government to establish a surveillance team for West Nile, following the initial cases documented in the summer of 1999. The following conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Gizmodo: As a lifelong New York City resident, the arrival of West Nile that year [1999] was one of the 1st truly frightening news events I can remember witnessing growing up. But what was it like for the researchers and scientists on the ground, trying to study and contain it?

Kramer: At first, the idea that West Nile was here in the US was sort of like, "what!?" Because the initial thought was that it was St Louis encephalitis, but St Louis doesn't kill birds. So it took a little bit of time to sort that out, but not very long.

I never felt fear. I had questions. It was alarming that this virus could come to the US, but then the big question was, will it last? You know, will it make it through the winter? And if it makes it through, will it be able to establish itself? And if it establishes itself, what will happen when it gets to the southern states where there's a much longer transmission season? I think when you're in the middle of it, you don't have fear. You just have these questions. What do we need to do? How can we accomplish it? Let's get there.

Gizmodo: Ultimately, the virus did spread eastward, southward, and eventually everywhere, through the help of _Culex_ mosquitoes. Did we ever stand a chance of containing it in the beginning?

Kramer: For a zoonotic disease, once you have a receptive environment, susceptible hosts, and proper weather conditions, it's really hard to contain it. I think they did everything that they could have done. You know, they sprayed heavily in the areas where West Nile had been identified, like in Queens. But once it got in the birds -- and there are so many species of birds that are susceptible, I think it's over 300 -- every bird could have a role in keeping the virus going.

In retrospect, they could have paid more attention to birds dying earlier. But that's not a CDC thing, that's USDA [responsibility].

Birds were dying, but people weren't thinking in terms of public health. And I don't think most people noted the birds were dying at first. So maybe if that had been noticed earlier, then spraying early could have stopped it much earlier. But I don't know; it would have been hard.

Gizmodo: What do you think might be the most lasting legacy of West Nile?

Kramer: I think we've learned a lot from West Nile. One thing that West Nile did was also prepare us for Zika. Not that Zika is [maintained] in the country, and it's a completely different virus, but having the stronger public health infrastructure that we did helped us get the testing for Zika up very quickly.

I also think it taught us that we need to have a global perspective in order to be alert for invasive viruses and other pathogens. And not just the pathogens, but the mosquitoes. _Culex pipiens_ was an invasive species; it was brought to the USA. West Nile also really brought home the lesson of the One Health concept, where we have to pay attention not just to human disease but animal health. And it taught us that we need to keep communication open between labs and other scientists. It definitely increased communication between veterinarians and public health practitioners, and veterinarians had sometimes been sidelined in the past.

The other major lesson is about the complexity of these disease cycles; that it's not just the virus, or just the birds, or just the mosquitoes. There are different species of mosquitoes, and even within a species, there are differences in populations. Similarly with the virus, West Nile has more than one lineage, and the lineage that came here evolved. It was very well adapted when it came, but it's still evolving and adapting further.

Gizmodo: It seems like you're saying that we don't have the tools, even today, to eradicate West Nile in this country.

Kramer: Oh, yeah, no. It's out of the bag. It's enzootic [the animal equivalent of an endemic disease in people] in the wildlife, the birds, the mosquitoes. The activity level can go up and down year to year, but it cannot be eradicated.

Even if you had mosquito control that was really innovative, something like using _Wolbachia_ [a bacterium that's been used in other mosquito species to keep them from hosting and spreading diseases like Zika and dengue], there are enough birds, enough new birds every year that are susceptible and could keep it going.

What we have to do is maintain public health infrastructure, which we have to do for many reasons besides West Nile, like for tick-borne diseases and other invasive diseases. And I do think surveillance has really improved. It's more rapid, and we can do more specific testing. But I also think we need to rethink how we do surveillance.

There's some of that thought going on now, with all the new technology we have. We need to be able to see things that we're not looking for. Right now, we only test for what we know is here, and that's fine; we can follow the activity of what's here. But if something else comes in, and we miss it at first, because we're just doing this very specific testing, we're going to be in the same boat with the next invasive virus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) to North America in 1999 and its subsequent rapid spread across the Americas demonstrated the potential impact of arboviral introductions to new regions, and this was reinforced by the subsequent introductions of chikungunya and Zika viruses. Extensive studies of host-pathogen-vector-environment interactions over the past two decades have illuminated many aspects of the ecology and evolution of WNV and other arboviruses, including the potential for pathogen adaptation to hosts and vectors, the influence of climate, land use and host immunity on transmission ecology, and the difficulty in preventing the establishment of a zoonotic pathogen with abundant wildlife reservoirs. Here, we focus on outstanding questions concerning the introduction, spread, and establishment of WNV in the Americas, and what it can teach us about the future of arboviral introductions. Key gaps in our knowledge include the following: viral adaptation and coevolution of hosts, vectors and the virus; the mechanisms and species involved in the large-scale spatial spread of WNV; how weather modulates WNV transmission; the drivers of large-scale variation in enzootic transmission; the ecology of WNV transmission in Latin America; and the relative roles of each component of host-virus-vector interactions in spatial and temporal variation in WNV transmission. Integrative studies that examine multiple factors and mechanisms simultaneously are needed to advance our knowledge of mechanisms driving transmission.

[West Nile virus and the disease it causes in some species of birds and in humans has been with us in the USA for 20 years. Historically, after a surprising outbreak of an infectious disease, the lessons learned during the outbreak tend to fade from institutional memory. However, West Nile virus gives us annual reminders. The Kramer et al. article (item [2] above) provides a thoughtful assessment of the introduction of WNV into the USA and its subsequent spread in North America and beyond in the Americas and the responses that followed. She and her colleagues underscore the gaps in our knowledge. The need for interdisciplinary teamwork in these kinds of disease emergence and emergencies is emphasized and should be carried out within the conceptual framework of one health.

Going forward, it will be interesting to see whether there will be continuous support for the public health infrastructure that Dr Kramer mentions. It is difficult to predict when and where the next exotic pathogenic organism will arrive in the USA. It may be one of the viruses, bacteria, or parasites that ProMED-mail monitors in countries outside of the USA. But one will arrive. Will we be ready?
