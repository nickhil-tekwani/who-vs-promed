[1] Florida - novel whitefly-transmitted potyvirus, cucurbits

A novel whitefly-transmitted potyvirus isolated from cucurbits in Florida
----------------------------------------------
A novel whitefly-transmitted potyvirus was isolated from a squash
plant (_Cucurbita pepo_) with vein yellowing symptoms in Florida. The
virus, for which the name squash vein yellowing virus (SqVYV) is
proposed, has flexuous rod-shaped particles, approximately 900
nanometers in length. Koch's postulates were completed by mechanical
inoculation of _C. pepo_ seedlings with isolated virions. The
experimental host range was limited to species in the Cucurbitaceae,
with most dramatic symptoms in squash and watermelon, and excluded
all tested species in the Amaranthaceae, Apocynaceae, Asteraceae,
Chenopodiaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae, and Solanaceae. The virus was
not transmitted by aphids (_Myzus persicae_) but was transmitted by
whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_). Infection by SqVYV induced inclusion
bodies visible by electron microscopy that were characteristic of
members of the Potyviridae. Comparison of the SqVYV coat protein gene
and protein sequences with those of recognized members of the
Potyviridae indicate that it is a novel ipomovirus. A limited survey
revealed that SqVYV was also present in watermelons suffering from a
mature vine decline and fruit rot recently observed in Florida.

[2] Indiana - Florida watermelon virus identified

The squash vein yellowing virus has caused problems in Florida
watermelon fields for years. Now it has been identified in southern
Indiana. The virus was discovered in a Southwest Purdue Agricultural
Center field near Vincennes last September [2006]. The virus is
carried by the approximately 1/16-inch whitefly. Purdue plant
pathologist Dan Egel says the confirmation is significant, but not
cause for alarm.
Egel says whiteflies aren't normally agricultural pests in Indiana
because they are a southern species. But winds can blow them up from
the south. They feed on watermelon plants and pass the virus from
plant to plant. Egel says several strains of whitefly exist. The one
that transmits squash vein yellowing virus is strain B. But according
to Egel, the common greenhouse whitefly has not been shown to be
involved in the disease.
The disease can cause vine collapse, plant wilt, and root rot. In
Florida -- where the virus first appeared in 2002 -- the symptoms
have included discoloration of the fruit.

[An exciting new finding -- a novel species of plant virus has been
discovered, and already there is evidence that it is spreading. The
new virus belongs to the family of Potyviridae, the largest family of
plant viruses, and it is thought to be in the genus Ipomovirus. So
far there is only one other species in this genus -- sweet potato
mild mottle ipomovirus -- and one tentative species -- sweet potato
yellow dwarf (?) ipomovirus. Members of the Potyviridae affect a wide
range of crop plants including a number of cereals, potato, soybean,
papaya, cassava, banana, sugar cane, and various vegetables.
