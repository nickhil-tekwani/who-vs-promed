Ohio: Second Death Due to West Nile Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
A 75-year-old Cleveland man has become the first person in Northeast Ohio
and the second in the state to die of West Nile virus infection. Word of his
death came yesterday as Cuyahoga County health officials reported 2 more
West Nile cases, bringing the county total to 14. Statewide, 23 Ohioans have
been diagnosed with the disease. The man, who lived in Cleveland's Old
Brooklyn neighborhood on the West Side, died on Sun25 Aug 2002, said Matt
Carroll, the city's acting health director. The city first reported his case
Friday. He was the second Old Brooklyn resident to be infected with the
disease.
County health officials added a 98-year-old Parma man and a 49-year-old
Parma Heights man yesterday to their list of residents diagnosed with West
Nile virus. 3 other Parma residents, on Orchard, Lincoln and Fortune
avenues, have symptoms of the virus, officials said. Meanwhile, 2 other
county residents diagnosed this month remained hospitalized yesterday.

Texas: More Probable Human Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 42-year-old woman from west Plano likely will be Collin County's first
human case of the West Nile virus, authorities said on Mon 26 Aug 2002. The
woman was hospitalized for several days last week with flu-like symptoms, a
rash, joint shakes and other indicators of the virus, said Dr. Homer Reeves,
the Collin County medical director. A preliminary test suggests that she has
the virus and samples have been sent to the state Health Department for
confirmation. Reeves said the woman insists that she was infected while
visiting a senior health center in south Dallas, where she said she was
bitten by several mosquitoes.
Dallas County health officials announced also on Mon 26 Aug 2002 that 2 more
Dallas residents likely have the virus, bringing that county's number of
human infections to 8. The new cases include a woman in her 40s who was
hospitalized for a 24-hour observation last week and a man in his early 70s
who remains hospitalized in stable condition. Both are from north Dallas
near Interstate 635. Another man in his 70s has been recovering at a
hospital.
Doug McBride, spokesman for the Texas Department of Health, said the state's
official count of human cases is 34 people in 9 counties. That number does
not include 4 of the probable cases in Dallas County or the 1 in Collin
County.

Michigan: Two New Human Cases Bring Total to 15
-----------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed the
initial West Nile virus (WNV) cases in Michigan, the Michigan Department of
Community Health (MDCH) reported today. 2 new cases have also been reported,
bringing to 15 the total number of human cases in Michigan.
The confirmation was completed with testing in CDC laboratories. Once
initial cases are confirmed by the CDC, subsequent cases that meet strict
guidelines can also be confirmed by testing in state laboratories. 10 of the
state's initial 13 cases and one of the new cases are now confirmed under
those guidelines. The other 4 cases need further testing, said MDCH Chief
Medical Executive David R. Johnson, M.D.
The 11 confirmed cases are:
-- The first new case, a 55-year-old Kent County man, who has been released
from the hospital
-- Seven cases in Oakland County:
An 82-year-old man who has been released from the hospital;
A 63-year-old man, also released;
A 38-year-old woman who has been released;
A 62-year-old woman, also released;
An 85-year-old man hospitalized in serious condition;
A 65-year-old man who died;
&
A 74-year-old man hospitalized in serious condition.
-- A 44-year-old Bay County woman who is in inpatient rehabilitation.
--A 37-year-old Cass County man who has been released.
--An 80-year-old Wayne County man hospitalized in stable condition.
The 4 cases that remain probable and need additional testing are:
-- The second new case, a 39-year-old Macomb County woman who was
seen in an emergency room visit but not admitted.
-- A 9-month-old Oakland County infant who has been released.
-- A 38-year-old Oakland County man, also released.
-- An 82-year-old Oakland County woman, also released.
MDCH officials emphasized that a report of a second death attributed to West
Nile virus infection cannot yet be confirmed. "A 90-year-old Oakland County
man who had multiple medical problems died with encephalitis and meningitis,
but there are many causes of these illnesses other than West Nile virus,"
said Johnson. "Unfortunately, test specimens were not sent to the state
laboratories but to an independent lab, and their results are not
convincing. We are attempting to get a sufficient specimen for appropriate
testing in state laboratories."

Arkansas: First Human Case Confirmed; 2 Additional Suspect Cases
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Arkansas Department of Health today received from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) early test results confirming a human
case of West Nile virus infection. The patient, a resident of Jefferson
County, is not hospitalized and is recovering.
Additionally, the Arkansas Department of Health is reporting 2 more suspect
human cases of West Nile virus, one from Jefferson County and one from
Pulaski County. Samples will be sent to the CDC for confirmatory testing.
"This is our first confirmed case but the reality is that we have most
likely had previous cases of humans infected with West Nile virus who were
not sick enough to seek medical attention," Dr. Fay Boozman, ADH director,
said. "It is crucial that we maintain surveillance of West Nile virus and
recording the first human case just reinforces the need for mosquito
prevention and abatement. But I want to remind everyone that 99 percent of
those who are bitten by an infected mosquito will never experience symptoms
severe enough to seek medical attention."
To date, 14 suspect cases have/will be (see below) sent to the CDC for
confirmatory testing. The following is a breakdown of the suspect cases:
County/ Suspect Cases/ CDC Results/
Arkansas/ 3 /pending
Crittenden/ 1* /pending
Jefferson/ 5 /1 positive & 4 pending
Monroe/ 1 /pending
Pulaski/ 2 /pending
Union/ 2 /1 negative & 1 pending
* Results sent to private lab by physician. ADH has requested samples and
will send to CDC if suspected positive.

Washington State: Second Case of West Nile Illness (Imported)
------------------------------------------------------------
A Skagit County woman has tested positive for West Nile illness after being
bitten by mosquitoes while visiting Michigan. The Washington State
Department of Health has notified federal authorities of the diagnosis,
sending test results to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
for confirmation. West Nile virus (WNV), which may be transmitted to humans
by some mosquito species, has not been detected in mosquitoes or animals in
Washington.
"You're no more likely to get West Nile illness from a mosquito bite in
Washington today than you were yesterday because the disease is not here
yet," said Dr. Jo Hofmann, Washington State Communicable Disease
Epidemiologist. " We know that this patient was exposed in Michigan, based
on how quickly she developed symptoms after her return." The Skagit County
woman's symptoms included headache, fever, neck discomfort, muscle and joint
aches, swollen lymph nodes and a rash. She was not hospitalized, and is
recovering from her illness.
This is the second person to be diagnosed with WNV illness in Washington,
but is the first Washington resident to test positive for the disease,
making her the state's first official case according to CDC tracking
methods. The other person diagnosed with the illness earlier this month was
a man visiting Washington who lived elsewhere and was exposed to WNV while
traveling through Louisiana.

Virginia: 2 New Probable Cases of West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Springfield man has become the first northern Virginian identified as
having contracted West Nile virus, according to Virginia health officials,
who reported 2 new human cases of the mosquito-borne illness yesterday [29
Aug 2002], bringing the statewide total to 3.
Officials with the Virginia Department of Health said recent tests on a
65-year-old resident of North Springfield in Fairfax County and a
42-year-old Hanover County man were found "presumptively positive" for the
infection on Tue 27 Aug 2002. The laboratory samples have been sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation, which officials
said would take at least 10 days.
Health officials said they were not surprised by the new findings and expect
to see more human cases before the mosquito breeding season is over. "This
confirms our predictions," said Suzanne Jenkins, an assistant state
epidemiologist for the state health department. "We've seen it in a lot of
birds. We've seen it in a lot of mosquito pools, and we anticipated humans
would get infected in August and September [2002]."
Until recently, West Nile virus had been found only in birds, mostly crows,
in Northern Virginia. The state recorded its first human case this month
when tests confirmed that a 33-year-old Richmond man had become infected.
Shortly before that, a 55-year-old District resident was listed as the first
case in the Washington region. The Maryland victim was an unidentified
80-year-old Baltimore man who officials said was hospitalized 1 Aug 2002
with mild symptoms of encephalitis, but recovered.
Virginia health officials released few details yesterday about the state's 2
new cases. The Hanover man reportedly was admitted to the hospital 15 Aug
2002 and remains there in stable condition, officials said. The North
Springfield man checked into hospital on 17 Aug 2002, was discharged 6 days
later and is said to be "recovering well," according to state officials.

West Nile virus Latest News - As of Tue 27 Aug 2002
---------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has passed the 108th meridian on its trek west, now detected
as far west as Shepherd in Yellowstone County, Montana. Thus far in 2002,
West Nile virus has been detected in birds, mosquitoes, humans, horses
and/or other mammals in at least 41 states and Washington DC in the US; as
well as in Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan provinces in Canada;
and in people and mosquitoes in Israel. It has been most recently reported
for the first time from New Mexico and Montana (22 Aug 2002), Colorado &
Wyoming (16 Aug 2002), South Carolina (13 Aug 2002), and from Vermont, for
the first time since 2000 (6 Aug 2002).
Its range has expanded in each of the 4 years since the initial North
American outbreak in 1999, and has expanded considerably in 2002; now
detected in 13 states where it had not previously been seen (Colorado,
Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, & Wyoming). In the
Continental US only the 7 westernmost states have not reported the presence
of West Nile virus.
The number of human cases is changing rapidly, with at least 425 cases (20
fatalities) in 20 states and Washington DC reported as of Tue 27 Aug 2002 by
CDC as confirmed or probable. (An additional 2 probable cases were reported
on 16 Aug 2002 by the Oklahoma Department of Health.) This compares with 371
cases (16 fatalities) in 20 states reported on 23 Aug 2002; 296 cases (14
fatalities) in 17 states reported on 22 Aug 2002; and 156 cases reported the
previous week (14 Aug 2002). The largest case load is in the Gulf Coast
states, but significant increases in numbers affected are seen further
north, in Illinois, Ohio & Michigan. Most but not all of the cases involve
serious illness.
As of 27 Aug 2002, the tally of human cases reported from CDC and state
health sources includes: Alabama (5), Florida (1), Georgia (6, 2
fatalities), Illinois (42, 2 fatality), Indiana (6), Kentucky (1 case, 1
fatality), Louisiana (171, 8 fatalities), Maryland (1, this person or
another contracted disease in Illinois), Massachusetts (1), Michigan (13, 1
fatality), Mississippi (91, 3 fatalities), Missouri (15, 1 case contracted
by resident of Massachusetts, 1 presumed fatality), Nebraska (1), New York
(4, 1 fatality), Oklahoma (2 reported by Oklahoma Department of Health as
probable), Ohio (23, 2), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (3), Texas (34, 1
fatality), Virginia (1), Wisconsin (2) & Washington, DC (1).
Several of the human cases reported earlier were contracted while traveling
in another state, and therefore tallies of human cases by state of residence
are not completely consistent with those tallied by the location of the
illness. For example, a visitor to Washington State contracted West Nile
virus while in Louisiana, a 22-year-old Maryland resident contracted West
Nile virus while working in Illinois, a 38-year-old Massachusetts woman
became ill in Missouri, a Florida resident likely contracted the disease in
Louisiana, a Texas resident is suspected of having contracted West Nile
virus in Arkansas, and several residents of Alabama and Florida have been
hospitalized in the other state.

(1) West Nile Virus Activity; United States, Wed 21 to Tue 27 Aug 2002
------------------------------------------------------------------
This report summarizes West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance data reported to
CDC through ArboNET and by states and other jurisdictions as of 7:30 a.m.
Mountain Daylight Time, Wed 28 Aug 2002, and highlights WNV activity in
Illinois.
During the reporting period of 21 to 28 Aug 2002, a total of 210
laboratory-positive human cases of WNV-associated illness were reported from
Illinois (n=55), Mississippi (n=36), Louisiana (n=24), Ohio (n=22), Missouri
(n=16), Michigan (n=15), Texas (n=13), Georgia (n=6), New York (n=4),

& Virginia (n=one). During this period, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan,
Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Virginia, & Wisconsin reported their first
human cases for 2002.
During the same period, WNV infections were reported in 674 dead crows, 305
other dead birds, 581 horses, and 386 mosquito pools. During this period,
WNV activity was reported for the first time ever in Montana and New Mexico.
During 2002, a total of 480 human cases with laboratory evidence of recent
WNV infection have been reported from Louisiana (n=171), Mississippi (n=91),
Illinois (n=71), Texas (n=38), Missouri (n=25), Ohio (n=24), Michigan
(n=15), Alabama (n=8), Georgia (n6x), Indiana (n=6), New York (n=5),

Wisconsin (n=2), the District of Columbia (n=one), Florida (n=one), Maryland
(n=one), Massachusetts (n=one), Nebraska (n=one), & Virginia (n=one). Among
the patients with available data, the median age was 51 years (range:
9 months to 98 years), 237 (54%) were male, and the dates of illness onset
ranged from 10 Jun to 25 Aug 2002.

(2) Illinois: 1 Jan to Tue 27 Aug 2002
----------------------------------
In 2002, a total of 71 persons with laboratory evidence of West Nile virus
(WNV) infection were reported up to Tue 27 Aug 2002; 44 cases were
laboratory confirmed and 27 were probable. 4 cases were fatal; all 4
patients presented with encephalitis.
The 71 patients had a median age of 49 years (range: 2 to 92 years); 47%
were male. The median age for 32 patients with either aseptic meningitis or
encephalitis and a known age was 51 years (range: 18 to 92 years). Patients
who died ranged in age from 67 to 92 years. Initial clinical data indicate
that 20 patients presented with aseptic meningitis and 17 presented with
encephalitis. 9 patients presented with WNV-associated fever. The 25
remaining cases are under investigation. Dates of illness onset ranged from
14 Jul to 20 Aug 2002.
Of the 102 counties of Illinois, 92 (90 %) have reported WNV activity
(positive animal, mosquito, or human cases). Human cases have occurred among
persons in 9 counties, with 51 (72 %) cases reported from Cook County, the
most populated area of the state. The attack rate during the period 1 Jan to
27 Aug 2002 was 0.6 per 100 000 for the state population, and 1.0 for Cook
County.
IDPH has provided regular updates on WNV on its Web site
<http://www.idph.state.il.us>. Information on submission of specimens and
clinical information on WNV has been provided to local health departments,
infection control practitioners, infectious disease physicians, & hospital
laboratories. Special reminders have been sent to schools and camp grounds
asking them to inform students, spectators, and campers about mosquito
repellents and other protective measures. IDPH has conducted vector control
consultations and trainings on larviciding. Prevention messages emphasize
the need for personal protective measures and removing containers of
standing water around residences. Additional information about WNV activity
is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and
