Subject: Emergency Management Warning 12: Newcastle Disease in California
Backyard Poultry
Newcastle Disease Confirmed in California
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are conducting an
eradication campaign for Newcastle disease. The disease was confirmed on
October 1, 2002, and is restricted to backyard poultry. Clinical signs in
infected birds include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal
signs. Mortality is up to 90% of exposed birds. Commercial poultry, at
this time are not involved in the disease occurrence. Investigations are
on-going and all figures are pending final validation.
Situation Update:
Number of premises positive: 206
Number of contacts: 683
Number of premises depopulated: 504
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 385
Birds depopulated to date: 35,793 (approximate)
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino
Operational Update:
To date, the last reported positive case of Newcastle disease in California
was December 19, 2002.
Effective November 13, 2002, the California State Veterinarian has imposed
a quarantine (Food and Agriculture code Section 9562) on the following
counties: All of Los Angeles County; Portions of Riverside County; and
Portions of San Bernardino County.
Effective November 21, 2002, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that
regulates the interstate movement of poultry and poultry products from
California's already quarantined areas.
Poultry species affected by California's quarantine are: Chickens, Turkeys,
Ducks, Geese, Grouse, Partridges, Pheasants, Quails, Guinea Fowl, Pea Fowl
(Peacocks), Doves, Pigeons, Swans, Ratites, Ratite Eggs
Orange County, California (CA), is included in the Newcastle disease
surveillance activities due to the lack of geophysical boundaries between
Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino Counties.
Veterinary Services has worked with the U.S. Postal Service to affirm that
poultry will not be able to move out of the quarantined areas through the mail.
State and federal animal health officials are conducting door-to-door
surveys to identify fowl and other birds in the affected areas and are
following up on epidemiological associations. To date, depopulation,
cleaning and disinfecting, and carcass disposal are being conducted by CDFA
and APHIS. CDFA has closed all poultry exhibits and fairs and expositions
within the State of California.
The Newcastle disease situation is contained is still considered a single
outbreak cluster within a 30-mile radius in Los Angeles County and along
the Los Angeles/Riverside/San Bernardino County border.
Affected and exposed backyard poultry are being euthanized and
double-bagged. Task Force members are disinfecting the bags and
transporting the carcasses to restricted landfills for burial.
All door-to-door surveillance, along with interviews has established that
there have been no links to eastern States within the United States and no
exposure to other backyard poultry to other States.
Local commercial table egg layer birds are being closely monitored and will
only be allowed to move intrastate under CDFA monitoring and spent-hen
movements restricted to the day they are scheduled for processing.
New Trade Issues:
Nothing new to report.
Please forward this information to your federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary.
