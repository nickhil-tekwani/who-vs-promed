As of Wed 29 Nov 2017, there have been a total of:
1747 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
706 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.4 per cent],
1024 recoveries, and
17 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries, and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections as they are reported. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. Another complication is delayed reporting of cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update, through 29 Nov 2017, there have been a total of:
4 newly confirmed cases,
1 newly reported fatality, and
4 newly reported recoveries.

[In the 9 days since the last update, there have been 4 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia. The 4 cases come from 3 different regions (Al Qasim, Riyadh and Asir); 3 were classified as primary cases, although all 3 primary cases were still under investigation for possible high-risk exposure histories. One of the cases is a household contact. This case is a 13-year-old male, presumably from the same household as the 15-year-old male reported on the same day. While it is unusual to have non-adult cases reported, there have been 26 previously reported cases less than 20 years of age, with the youngest reported case in a 9-month-old infant.
