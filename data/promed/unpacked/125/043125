A deer infected with chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been found in a
new area in Utah. That's not a surprise, though; the new area is next
to an area where the disease has been for years.

Technicians at the Utah Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Logan have
finished testing tissue samples taken from more than 1200 deer, elk
and moose this fall [2011]. Hunters across Utah took the animals, and
biologists with the Division of Wildlife Resources collected the
samples.

One of the deer that was taken on the San Juan deer hunting unit in
southeastern Utah tested positive for the disease. This is the 1st
time a deer from the unit has tested positive for chronic wasting
disease (CWD).

Leslie McFarlane, wildlife disease coordinator for the DWR, says she's
not surprised that a deer from the San Juan unit tested positive for
CWD. "We've found deer with CWD on the La Sal Mountains," she says.
"The La Sal Mountains are just north of the San Juan unit."

Fortunately for Utah's deer herds, CWD is not widespread in Utah.
Since 2002, almost 19 000 deer have been tested in the state, out of
which only 54 tested positive for CWD. The 54 deer came from 3 major
areas in Utah: Southeastern Utah (38), Central Utah (10), Northeastern
Utah (6). To date, only one elk -- a cow taken on the La Sal Mountains
in November 2009 -- has tested positive for the disease. CWD has never
been found in a moose in Utah.

CWD is fatal to deer, elk and moose, but there is no evidence that it
can be transmitted to humans. More information about CWD is available

A deer at a game farm in the Prince Albert District died as a result
of chronic wasting disease (CWD), a test confirmed last month
[November 2011].

"We're still doing an investigation," Canadian Food Inspection Agency
veterinarian disease control specialist Alex McIsaac said, adding that
not much more information on this specific case can be shared.

The typical process is being followed, he said, wherein the area is
contained, quarantined, and, in all likelihood, depopulated, with the
farm owner receiving compensation to help offset the costs. The
difficult process of cleaning and disinfecting can then take place.

The source of the infected animal will also be determined to help stem
further spread of the disease, McIsaac said.

The location of the gaming farm in question will not be shared beyond
the Prince Albert District description, an area stretching from the
City of Prince Albert area both east and north to the province's
boarders with Manitoba and the Yukon Territory, respectively.

The timeline of when the farm can again house game will depend on how
the cleanup process goes. Spread by excretions, all dirt, feeding
troughs, and anything else the animals may have touched will have to
be burned or buried.

Similar to mad cow disease, chronic wasting disease is a progressive,
fatal nervous system disease. Unlike mad cow disease, it has thus far
not been proven to have any effect on humans. "That's one of the more
important things to know," McIsaac noted, adding that measures to stem
the disease's spread have to do with protecting the animals.

This is the 4th case reported throughout the province so far this year
[2011], McIsaac said. The other cases were a 15 May 2011 elk, a 19 Jan
2011 deer, and another 4 Jan 2011 deer.

Testing is mandatory at gaming farms throughout the prairies and the
Yukon Territory, with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency requiring
that all elk, deer, and moose that die have their heads shipped in for
testing. The only way to test animals for chronic wasting disease is
to take samples from the brain and other tissue, post-mortem.

There are a number of signs, including depression, difficulty
swallowing, excessive salivation, paralysis, unusual behaviour, weight
loss, and several other things, all or some of which pop up about 36
months after [initial] infection.

McIsaac said: "Once you see the signs, it's been a while," adding that
by this time, the whole herd will have to be killed, as the disease
would have had adequate time to spread."

McIsaac said that farmers can help minimize their herd's risk of
getting chronic wasting disease by signing up for the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency's voluntary herd certification program, wherein they
confirm the cause of death of every animal on their farm through
agency-test documentation. In addition, farmers should only buy
animals from other farms that have signed up for the voluntary
program, he said.

Instances of chronic wasting disease also pop up in wild game,
although the monitoring of wild game is less time-sensitive than
monitoring on the more concentrated setting of a farm. Wild game
monitoring serves as surveillance.

The Ministry of Environment has initiated a voluntary program wherein
hunters can submit deer and elk heads to the nearest Ministry of
Environment office by 15 Jan 2012. Heads must be submitted with
antlers removed in leak-proof plastic bags alongside a hunter license
number, the hunter's surname, given name, phone number, location of
the animal's harvest, the kill date, and the species and sex of the
deer or elk killed.

The results of wild game chronic wasting disease testing will be
released some time early in the new year [2012].

In 2010, 31 wild mule deer and 4 wild white tail deer tested positive
for chronic wasting disease, about on par with previous years. The
year's sample consisted of 1195 animals.

First popping up in Saskatchewan in 1996, over the years, 47 580 wild
animals have been tested, of which 250 mule deer, 61 white tail deer,
and 3 elk have tested positive for chronic wasting disease. As for
instances of chronic wasting disease in farmed animals, McIsaac said
that this year's [2011] 4 animals testing positive is nothing to worry
about. "This is about average. This is not unexpected or abnormal," he
said.

[Many states and provinces have established an
inspection/reporting/certification program for captive cervid herds.
It is one measure to help these producers purchase animals from
disease-free herds.

This disease has been documented in the US since the 1960's. There is
no evidence that it can affect humans. - Mod.TG
