LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY: RFI
=======================================
Would anyone be able to tell me how community acquired Legionnaire's is
differentiated from nosocomial? Consider the following case: person A (1
year old child) is admitted to a hospital with a temperature of 105 F, no
evidence of respiratory distress, irregular pulse of 80, no subcostal or
intercostal react retractions, fontanella was depressed, eyeballs sunken and
mucosa dry, demonstrated rales and rhonchi on the right lung field. No
evidence of cyanosis in x-ray. Upon admission the patient had a PO2 of 46%
on room air. The patient was then placed on oxygen by nasal cannula and
found to be tachypneic with a heart rate in the range of 185-195. Patient
was intubated and bagged and the PO2 rose to 80-85. Twelve hours later the
patient died, provisional autopsy report noted a diagnosis of hypoxemia
secondary to infectious process.
Patient B (20 years old) had a history of severe intractible back pain, high
fever and left lower lobe pneumonia with pleurisy. Patient was treated with
IV antibiotics and perineal narcotic analgesics and appeared to improve
clinically with reducing temperature but continued to have fever spikes. On
the fourth day of hospitalization patient was found collapsed and cyanotic.
Following intubation and placement on ventilator, the patient went into
shock. A chest x-ray was taken and diagnosis of adult respiratory distess
syndrome was made. Patient stabilized and oxygen saturation improved to the
70's. Sepsis with associated respiratory distress syndrome was the
diagnosis made. On the eighth day of hospitalization, the patient died.
Do these sound like they could be nosocomial or community acquired? Any
help on this will be greatly appreciated.
