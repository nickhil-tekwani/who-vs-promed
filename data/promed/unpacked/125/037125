In recent days, web users said that dengue fever deaths caused by tick bites had occurred in Liuan [dengue viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes, not ticks. - Mod.TY]. On 10 Jul [2020], Liuan Municipal Health Commission and relevant agencies in Gubei Township of Jinzhai County responded to this, saying that there have indeed been cases of Jinzhai County residents developing fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome after being bitten by ticks, but infection by this disease does not cause or transmit dengue fever.

According to the information posted to Jinzhai County People's Government website on 9 Jul [2020], since April of this year [2020], the county has had 23 people admitted to hospital after tick bites and 5 died.

On the afternoon of 10 Jul [2020], a duty officer at Liuan Municipal Health Commission Disease Control department said that farmers working on the ground are susceptible to bites by ticks and leeches in many mountainous areas of Liuan, which can cause susceptible populations to develop fever with symptoms like thrombocytopenia syndrome causing a reduction of platelets. "This isn't infection by dengue fever, rather it is infection by a (novel) kind of bunyavirus [this should refer to Huaiyangshan banyangvirus]." The staff worker said this is one of the viruses carried by ticks...

Public information shows that during the acute phase of fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome caused by Huaiyangshan banyangvirus, the blood and bloody secretions of patients are infectious.

Severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus infections have been occurring in China and elsewhere in East Asia over the past 11 years, and again this year (2020) with 23 hospitalizations and 5 deaths mentioned above. The longhorn tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is the virus vector. There is no vaccine and avoidance of tick bites is the only currently available preventive measure.

In 2012, Zhang et al (reference below) proposed that the name of the syndrome be designated as Huaiyangshan hemorrhagic fever (HYSHF) and the virus Huaiyangshan virus (HYSV) as a substitute for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) and virus. Their proposal seems not to have been adopted, as subsequent reports continue to refer to SFTS.
