[The 37 new confirmed and 731 suspected cases indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing as Nigeria is now in the period of the year when more cases usually occur as illustrated in the graph in Figure 3. There are 69 confirmed deaths, up from 51 in the previous reporting period. Unfortunately, 3 new healthcare workers, one each in Benue, Bauchi and Rivers States, were infected during this reporting period. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, occurring in 20 states (up from 19 in a previous reporting period) and 54 LGAs (up from 51 in the previous reporting period).

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY

From 1 Jan - 10 Feb 2019, 327 cases of Lassa fever (324 confirmed cases and 3 probable cases) with 72 deaths (case fatality ratio 22%) have been reported across 20 states and the Federal Capital Territory, with the majority of cases being reported from Edo (108) and Ondo (103) states. A total of 12 cases have been reported among healthcare workers in 7 states - Edo (4), Ondo (3), Ebonyi (1), Enugu (1), Rivers (1), Bauchi (1) and Benue (1) including one death in Enugu.

The number of confirmed cases reported across Nigeria remains high. In week 6, 2019 (week ending 10 Feb 2019), 37 new confirmed cases including 10 deaths (case fatality ratio 27%) were reported from 9 states across Nigeria. The majority of cases were reported from Ondo (12) and Edo (10) states. The number of confirmed cases reported in week 6, 2019, represents a slight decrease compared to week 5 when 68 confirmed cases were reported (Figure 1).

Of the 3746 contacts identified since January 2019, 2658 are still under follow-up while 1045 have completed 21 days of follow-up. As many as 60 contacts became symptomatic, of which 39 tested positive.

A total 91 case-patients are currently in admission at treatment centers across the country. The case-patients are being treated with standard supportive care.

Public health response
----------------------
- On 22 Jan 2019, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) declared the outbreak an emergency.
- Multi-sectoral One Health national rapid response teams have been deployed to Ondo, Edo, Ebonyi, Plateau, and Bauchi to support field investigation and response activities.
- Enhanced surveillance is ongoing in all states following alert communication and a press release from NCDC.
- Treatment of Lassa fever cases is also ongoing at designated treatment centres across the country.
- Risk communication and community engagement activities continue in the states. National awareness was improved through the recently concluded international Lassa fever conference which took place from 16 -17 Jan 2019.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
Lassa fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever that is transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with rodent urine or faeces. Person-to-person infections and laboratory transmission can also occur. The overall case fatality rate is 1%; it is 15% among patients hospitalized with severe illness. There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.

Although Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Nigeria with the peak season anticipated from December through June, the current increase in new confirmed cases and deaths should be monitored closely and addressed appropriately. Cases in neigbouring Benin and Togo potentially originating from Nigeria have been reported in previous years and therefore neighbouring countries should be monitored accordingly.

With 12 confirmed cases so far among healthcare workers, there is evidence of nosocomial transmission of the disease amidst reports of inadequate infection prevention and control (IPC) supplied in some health facilities and complacency on the part of health workers towards maintaining IPC measures.

WHO advice
----------
Prevention of Lassa fever relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. In healthcare settings, staff should consistently implement standard infection prevention and control measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. WHO continues to advice all countries in the Lassa fever belt on the need to enhance early detection and treatment of cases to reduce the case fatality rate as well as strengthen cross-border collaboration.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restriction to Nigeria based on the currently available information.

[The WHO recommended community engagement is a challenge, given the broad geographical area in which cases are occurring. A proactive public education effort is required to encourage use of containers that prevent rodent access to food materials and blocking of entry points of the rodents into houses.

Interestingly, although the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions, on 7 Feb 2019 the USA CDC has recommended taking precautions in its updated travel advisory for Nigeria due to the recent Lassa fever cases, stating, "Travelers to Nigeria should avoid contact with rats, especially rat urine and feces, and take precautions to keep their accommodations clean and free of rodents. If you need to clean up after rodents, take the proper steps to avoid getting sick. Travelers should also wash hands often, and avoid contact with people who are sick. Travelers who develop fever or other serious symptoms of Lassa fever during or after their trip should see a doctor right away. They should tell the doctor where they traveled in Nigeria and whether they had contact with a rodent or sick person." (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/lassa-fever-nigeria). - Mod.TY
