Equine Cases of West Nile Virus Infection: 1 Jan through 31 Oct 2001
-------------------------------------------------
There have been 347 cases (344 confirmed, 3 probable) of clinical West Nile
virus (WNV) infection in horses from 18 States (see Summary by State and
County, below). Of 262 horses for which an outcome has been reported to
date, at least 59 (22.5 percent) died or were euthanatized. The numbers of
equine deaths associated with WNV infection by State are: Connecticut, 3;
Delaware, 1; Florida, 31; Georgia, 2; Illinois, 1; Louisiana, 3;
Massachusetts, 1; Mississippi, 3; New Jersey, 5; New York, 2; North
Carolina, 1; Pennsylvania, 4; Tennessee, 1; and Virginia, 1.
Of the 344 confirmed cases, 342 were positive on a WNV IgM-capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) and a WNV plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT) performed on serum at the National Veterinary
Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. One of the other 2 case horses
had brain tissue that tested positive at the NVSL on WNV reverse
transcriptase nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR), had serum that
was positive on WNV PRNT, and had WNV isolated from brain tissue. An
additional horse was positive on WNV RT-nPCR on a virus isolate submitted
to the NVSL for confirmatory testing. Of the 342 serologically positive
confirmed cases, brain tissues were submitted from 11 horses and tested
positive on WNV RT-nPCR performed on those tissues. WNV was isolated at the
NVSL from 2 of those 11 brains to date. All 3 probable case horses were
positive on WNV RT-nPCR performed on brain tissue.
