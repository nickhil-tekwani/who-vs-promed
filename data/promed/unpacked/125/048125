Government claims dip in epidemic as two more die in the Capital
Even as the Delhi government claimed that there was a decrease in the new
patients of epidemic dropsy, two more persons died due to the disease. With
this, 52 people have died in the Capital due to dropsy, which has left over
2,200 people ill in the city so far. One death each was reported at the Ram
Manohar Lohia Hospital and ESI Hospital in Basaidarapur. However, Delhi
Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan claimed that there was a fall in dropsy
cases since only 38 new cases were admitted as against 118 patients on 3
Sep 1998.

In a surprising development, the state government run Food and Drugs
laboratory at Vadodara on Tuesday ruled out the presence of argemone, the
agent which causes dropsy, in all the 18 random samples of ground nut and
palmolein edible oil.
Joint Commissioner of FDL K.M. Bhatt said on Tuesday that both the primary
and secondary tests have confirmed that the samples picked of groundnut
from Godhra district and palmolein sent from Ahmedabad were free from
Argemone Mexicana.
In Ahmedabad, state health minister Ashok Bhatt claimed that results of
seven more samples of palmolein oil were awaited. The case of a man and his
daughter who were affected by dropsy within four days of consuming the
adulterated oil was not [consistent with [reports of others afflicted
with dropsy in Sabarkantha district, he admitted. So far 16 cases of dropsy
have been detected, none in the past 24 hours . The incubation of dropsy
from contamination to full visibility of symptoms was 20 days and this
needed to be investigated, according to the minister.
