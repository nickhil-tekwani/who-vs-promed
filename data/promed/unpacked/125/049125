[This appears to be part of an encephalitis outbreak that has been
going on in Uttar Pradesh at least since early July 2011. The
etiologies responsible for these encephalitis cases has been variously
attributed to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and to an acute
encephalitis syndrome of undetermined etiology. The above report does
not mention if JEV is responsible for these most recent cases, nor
what action has been taken to obtain a laboratory diagnosis.

Purvanchal is a geographic region comprised of the eastern end of
Uttar Pradesh state and borders Nepal to the north, the state Bihar to
the east, Bagelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh state to the south, the
Awadh region of Uttar Pradesh to the west and the end of Doab (at
Allahabad) in Uttar Pradesh to its south west. A map of the Purvanchal
