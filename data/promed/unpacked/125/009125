Summary of TWG activities:
Coordination
- Yellow fever response activities are coordinated by the NCDC through a multi-agency yellow fever Technical Working Group (YF TWG)
- Finalised the yellow fever training manual for training of health workers on yellow fever detection, case management, documentation, and reporting
- Off-site support to states with recent confirmed cases (Anambra, Imo, Ondo, Osun and Sokoto)

Epidemiology/Surveillance/Data Management
- Daily monitoring and analysis of surveillance data across the country to guide response activities
- Engagement with state epidemiologists for weekly updates
- Update cases in the SORMAS platform

Laboratory
- Coordination of yellow fever sample management and transportation from all states to the regional reference laboratories
- Regular testing of yellow fever samples in all the testing laboratories
- Ensured availability of reagents and consumables in all testing laboratories
- Ongoing validation of Mologic rapid test kit for yellow fever
- 1st quarter (January - March 2022) data harmonization meeting in Lagos

Case management
- Ongoing plan for capacity building of 32 tertiary healthcare workers in 4 states in Southeast on IDSR and yellow fever case identification, management, and reporting

ProMED from Global Incident Map - Outbreaks

[Yellow fever (YF) virus transmission remains active so far this year [2022]. In July 2022 there were 176 suspected YF cases of which 4 died and 4 cases were confirmed. For the current year (2022) there were 1179 suspected cases with 14 deaths and 8 presumptive and 5 confirmed cases. The YF vaccination coverage in Nigeria is 63%, less than the 80% needed for adequate prevention (see Yellow fever - Africa (11): WHO, east, west and central Africa: 20220903.8705390). One hopes that the vaccination planned in the next steps will increase coverage significantly. Inclusion of YF in routine childhood vaccination programs in areas where YF is endemic should effectively provide immunity for the population for the long term. - Mod.TY
