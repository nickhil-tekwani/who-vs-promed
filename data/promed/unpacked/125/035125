[The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided the following guidance on COVID-19 for those with pets (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/pets.html):

"Because there is a risk that people with COVID-19 could spread the virus to animals, CDC recommends that pet owners limit their pet's interaction with people outside their household.

- Keep cats indoors when possible and do not let them roam freely outside.
- Pets or other animals should not be allowed to roam freely around the facility, and cats should be kept indoors.
- Avoid public places where a large number of people gather.
- Do not put a mask on pets. Masks could harm your pet.

"There is no evidence that the virus can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets. Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. Talk to your veterinarian if you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet.

"Talk to your veterinarian if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pet's health."

The following has been extracted from the OIE Technical factsheet "Questions and Answers on COVID-19" (last updated 22 Jan 2021), available at https://www.oie.int/en/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/:

"There is no evidence that companion animals are playing an epidemiological role in the spread of human infections of SARS-CoV-2. However, as animals and people can both be affected by this virus, it is recommended that people who are suspected or confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 virus avoid close contact with their companion animals and have another member of their household care for them. If they must look after their companion animals, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask, if possible. Animals belonging to owners infected with COVID-19 virus should be kept indoors in line with similar lockdown recommendations for humans applicable in the country or area. There is no justification in taking measures which may compromise the welfare of companion animals.

"As a general good practice, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented when handling and caring for animals. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, being licked by animals, or sharing food." - Mod.CRD
