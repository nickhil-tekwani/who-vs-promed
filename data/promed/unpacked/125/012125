People have been warned not to fish in or eat fish from reefs, and not to
swim if dead fish are present. These preventive measures were announced by
Minister of Agriculture Anthony Wood after laboratory investigation
confirmed that the bacterium _Streptococcus iniae_ is responsible for
massive fish kills along the coasts and reefs of Barbados.
Although this bacterium has been involved in fish deaths in the US, Canada,
Australia, Japan and Israel, this marks the first time it has attacked salt
water fish species. [Not according to ref.(02) above - Mod.JW]
Experts speculate that the bacteria may have been brought by a storm,
and/or environmental changes in the chemical composition of the sea have
enabled the bacteria to thrive. Guyana, Trinidad & Tobago, Saint Vincent,
The Grenadines and Grenada have experienced similar fish kills.

[These islands are the southern part of the Windward Islands chain. Can we
expect the bacteria to spread across the St. Vincent Passage to the rest of
the Windwards: St Lucia, Martinique & Dominica? And to stop there & not
spread to Guadeloupe & the Leeward Islands, because of the wind effect? -
