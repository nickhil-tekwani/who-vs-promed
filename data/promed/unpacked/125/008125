Zambo health officials probe 'severe type' of pneumonia
-------------------------------------------------------
Zamboanga City's health office was reported to be studying a severe
type of pneumonia among its residents. 1500 patients suspected to be
affected by the severe pneumonia were subjected to a series of tests
by the Department of Health [DOH]. City health officer Rodel Agbulos
said that a recent study by DOH among pneumonia patients showed that
a "vectoral viral strain" was present. Agbulos said they have already
coordinated with the regional health office on how to further study
the disease.

Agbulos however said that residents have nothing to worry about since
the virus is a common upper respiratory tract infection although, he
also said, it is stronger than ordinary pneumonia and is not common
to local residents. The virus could have been brought by those who
are coming in and out of Zamboanga City including deportees from Malaysia.

[Pneumonia morbidity is historically high in the Philippines
(<http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/FA5CA9AA-B230-4863-837D-A0709ECAA514/0/philippines_ehcp_18Nov2004.pdf>),
but no deaths are reported in this newswire. The phrase 'vectoral
viral strain' perhaps suggests an insect-transmitted virus, whereas
most common viral respiratory pathogens are not transmitted in this
way. Further information about this outbreak would be appreciated.
