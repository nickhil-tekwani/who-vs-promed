[This event was initially published in Malaysian media (26 Aug 2015), at that time suspected locally as introduced with 4 race horses imported from New Zealand on 31 Jul 2015 via Singapore. The presence of equine influenza was categorically denied by both latter countries: the disease had never been recorded in New Zealand; its last recording in Singapore dates back to 1977.

Equine influenza is an acute respiratory infection of horses, donkeys, and mules caused by 2 distinct subtypes (H7N7, formerly equi-1, and H3N8, formerly equi-2). It deserves to be mentioned that H3N8 has been detected in other species, including dogs.

Malaysia reported officially the event to the OIE on 6 Sep 2015. While the report mentioned that the source of infection was due to the entry of live animals, it was not clear when such animals became infected, especially given that the animals originated from a country where the disease had never been reported. These horses may very well have been in contact with horses from other areas where the disease may occur, or (less likely) with infected animals of other species.

The source of infection remains to be elucidated, to prevent a reoccurrence of similar events in countries maintaining long-standing freedom of the agent while prohibiting vaccination, such as Malaysia. Genotyping of the strain from Malaysia may enable tracing back its source. - Mod.AS
