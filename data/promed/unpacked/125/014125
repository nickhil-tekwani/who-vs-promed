A total of 18 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been
registered in the South Federal District of Russia as of 13 May 2008. Of
those, 2 patients have died.

In 2008 4 cases have been registered in Ingushetia (one fatality), 11 cases
in the Stavropol Region (one fatality), and 3 cases -- in the Rostov region.

All regions of the Southern Federal District have begun to treat the
livestock with acaricide. But in some regions (Astrakhan region,
Ingushetia) acaricide treatment has been insufficient. In the Astrakhan
region only 2.9 per cent of cattle and 0.52 per cent of other livestock
have been treated.

Last year [2007] there were 234 cases of CCHF in the South Federal
District, with 4 deaths. In 2006 200 cases were registered.

[The number of cases of CCHF has increased in the Southern Federal District
of Russia. The geographical extent of disease has widened. Prognosis of
experts for 2008 are unfavourable. Judging by rates of growth of disease
this year the extent of infection may be even greater than 2007 - Mod.NP

The treatment of livestock with acaricides is intended to reduce the risk
of tick bite for farm workers and others. The virus causing CCHF is
transmitted to humans by ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_. Cattle and other
domestic livestock are relatively unharmed by CCHF virus infection. It is
likely that the increased prevalence of CCHF disease in the human
population of the Southern Federal District reflects both an increase in
the tick population and inadequacy of tick control measures.
