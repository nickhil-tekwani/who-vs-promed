At least 50 children were rushed to the Bayawan District Hospital in Negros Oriental on Thursday evening, 19 May [2022], after they reportedly consumed contaminated milk during the resumption of in-person classes in the different schools in the province.

Ruben Mu√±ez Jr, a nurse of the Bayawan District Hospital, told the Inquirer that the patients were showing symptoms of gastrointestinal illness. Local health officials were still waiting for the result of laboratory tests as of posting time.
