In French Polynesia, the office that monitors health has confirmed 2 deaths related to chikungunya [virus infections]. On the archipelago, 5000 cases of infection have been reported over the past few days.

On Wednesday [19 Nov 2014], the office manager for Public Health Surveillance in French Polynesia, Henri-Pierre Mallet, confirmed the deaths of 2 patients following their chikungunya virus infections. He said that 2 person's advanced age resulted in complications. These 2 deaths are the 1st currently recorded in Polynesia, which had its 1st outbreak of chikungunya a few weeks ago.

The epidemic has reached worrying proportions in the archipelago, where the Health Watch office said last week that there were 5000 possible cases.

[The chikungunya virus outbreak in French Polynesia is increasing rapidly and placing stress on medical services. Since the detection of the 1st cases on 10 Oct 2014, the virus has spread to several islands in French Polynesia, and the case number has now climbed to an estimated 5000, with the 2 deaths. In the absence of a commercially available vaccine, vector control is the only preventive measure available.
