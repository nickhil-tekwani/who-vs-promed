I would appreciate your assistance in posting the following response
to the report entitled: "7 measles cases spotted in DuPage County."

The current investigation does not support a link between the visitor
from Switzerland and the 7 measles cases detected in DuPage County,
Illinois.

[ProMED-mail regrets the confusion. The linking of the 2 outbreaks
would not have been assumed if either of the 2 health authorities
concerned had disclosed the precise locations of the outbreaks. -
