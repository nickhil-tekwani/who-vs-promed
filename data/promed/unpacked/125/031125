Ontario has at least 5 cases of bird flu.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) on [31 Mar 2022] confirmed a case of H5N1 in a poultry flock in the Township of Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation in Bruce County.

The premises is under quarantine and CFIA is recommending increased biosecurity measures.

The CFIA confirmed another case of H5N1 the day before [30 Mar 2022] in a poultry flock in Woolwich, Ont.

These cases follow 2 additional cases of H5N1. One discovered in a poultry flock in Zorra, Ont. on [28 Mar 2022] and another in a poultry flock in Guelph on [27 Mar 2022].

These are also in addition to the CFIA confirming a case of H5N1 in a red-tailed hawk in Waterloo Region on [21 Mar 2022].

In response to the positive confirmations, the Feather Board Command Centre, created to be the central figure in Ontario's risk management strategy of the province's chicken, egg, turkey and hatchery sectors, issues a biosecurity advisory to all Ontario producers.

The 5 Ontario cases of avian influenza bring the total number of confirmed cases in Canada to 13.

Other provinces have their own issues with bird flu as well. Between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador, another 7 cases. The instances of bird flu in those 2 provinces led multiple countries to impose bans on Canadian poultry.

[2] Wyoming (Johnson County): mixed species of birds, non-commercial

https://newslj.com/content/usda-confirms-avian-influenza-wyoming


A case of bird flu has been found in Johnson County, prompting a warning to people who have chickens, turkeys or other birds to take steps to protect their birds.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza -- HPAI or also called avian influenza or bird flu -- is a highly contagious viral disease that can infect chickens, turkeys and other birds and can cause severe illness and/or sudden death in infected birds, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA].

The bird flu was found in a non-commercial mixed-species backyard flock (non-poultry) in Johnson County.

"Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard chicken owner to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to ensure the health of their birds," according to a press release.

Health officials say they don't know of any people who have caught the bird flu in the U.S., and the disease doesn't present an immediate public health concern. The virus can spread from infected birds to people, but such infections are rare and haven't led to sustained outbreaks among humans, an Associated Press report said.

The USDA encourages poultry owners to attentively monitor their birds for symptoms of HPAI, which include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge and other signs of respiratory distress. Other signs include lack of energy and appetite and decreased water consumption and egg production along with soft-shelled or misshapen eggs. They also might show signs of incoordination and diarrhea.

If people see those symptoms in their birds, they should immediately contact their veterinarian. They also can contact the Wyoming Livestock Board at 307-777-8720 or 307-777-6440.

Officials in the Massachusetts town of Dighton are warning residents who own domestic poultry to be aware avian flu has been detected in the state.

In an announcement on Tuesday [29 Mar 2022], Dighton Animal Control Officer Stacy Ferry offered important safety tips to prevent the spread of the virus.

The Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources (MADR) has confirmed Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) has been detected in wild birds in multiple locations in the state and appears to be prevalent in at least some species of the region's wild bird population.

According to the MDAR, this means all domestic poultry in Massachusetts may be at risk of exposure to the virus, which can be fatal for birds like chickens and turkeys.

Earlier this month [March 2022], the owners of Pumpkin Wall Farm in Derry, New Hampshire, said about 80 of their birds were euthanized by state workers after 5 turkeys at the animal sanctuary suddenly died of the avian flu. Wild ducks carrying the virus landed in their pond and infected the flock, which meant the rest of the farm's chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys then had to be put down.

The MDAR said waterbirds including shorebirds and waterfowl, especially dabbling ducks like Mallards, are most likely to carry the HPAI virus.

People who own chickens, turkeys and guinea fowl, and game birds like pheasants, are advised to keep waterbirds away from their domestic birds.

Owners of domestic birds are also advised to ensure good biosecurity is being used to protect the animals, as owners and visitors may accidentally expose their birds to HPAI through contaminated shoes, clothing or equipment.

Ferry is encouraging Dighton residents to avoid any unnecessary contact with birds, if possible, to prevent infection.

"The Town of Dighton is monitoring the prevalence of avian flu throughout the state and is working to ensure residents are cautious of their flock," Ferry said in a statement. "Anyone with questions regarding the avian flu and their flock is encouraged to contact the town directly.

The MDAR said sick or dead domestic birds -- chickens, turkeys, gamebirds, domestic ducks, etc. -- should be reported to the department's Division of Animal Health or through an online reporting form accessed at https://www.mass.gov/forms/poultry-disease-reporting-form.

Sick or dead wild birds, however, should be reported to the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game's Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (MassWildlife) by calling or by emailing <Mass.Wildlife@mass.gov>.

Cases of bird flu have been detected in a flock of chickens kept in a Franklin County backyard, according to the Ohio Department of Agriculture.

The department said the cases do not present an immediate public health concern.

The department said the flock is being "depopulated" to prevent the disease's spread.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), commonly referred to as the bird flu or avian flu, is a highly contagious virus spreading quickly and is often fatal to flocks, both commercial and non-commercial poultry, the department said in a press release.

HPAI is often carried by free-flying waterfowl like ducks and geese and can infect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture quarantined the affected area and will conduct additional testing in the areas in a 10-kilometer (6.21 miles) zone around the infected area.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control said no human cases of bird flu have been reported in the United States.

In a previous version of this story, ODA identified the specific area the chickens were found as Hilliard. However, the City of Hilliard states the location is actually Brown Township, noting "The number of individuals within Hilliard who could even raise poultry is very limited due to city code!"

The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flock (non-poultry) in Berkshire County, Massachusetts; a non-commercial, mixed-species backyard flock (non-poultry) in Johnson County, Wyoming; a commercial poultry flock in Johnston County, North Carolina; a non-commercial, backyard chicken flock (non-poultry) in Franklin County, Ohio; and a non-commercial, backyard chicken flock (poultry) in Kidder County, North Dakota.

Samples from all the flocks were first tested at state laboratories which are part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network. Results were subsequently confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. Samples from the Massachusetts flock were tested at the Connecticut Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory. Samples from the Wyoming flock were tested at Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory. Samples from the North Carolina flock were tested at the Rollins Diagnostic Laboratory. Samples from the Ohio flock were tested at the Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. Samples from the North Dakota flock were tested at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in all the states on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the properties will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flocks will not enter the food system.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the recent HPAI detections do not present an immediate public health concern. No human cases of these avian influenza viruses have been detected in the United States. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 F [74 C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, Federal and State partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to ensure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://bit.ly/38p9ZvK.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. OIE trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a State but will not announce subsequent detections in the State. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors, when possible, to prevent further exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs which must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

On Friday [1 Apr 2022] the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services announced that 2 more commercial turkey operations in Johnston County have tested positive for High Path Avian Influenza (HPAI).

The farms were identified after another nearby farm earlier this week euthanized 32 000 turkeys after a positive sample within the flock. A 6.2 [10 km] mile test zone was established, leading to these new positive cases.

The Ag department will again expand the test zone from the new locations to look for further infections.

"The 2 additional flocks totaling about 28 500 turkeys are in the process of being depopulated and 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] zones will be set up around these new sites to test nearby farms for the virus," said State Veterinarian Mike Martin. "Most of this new zone will fall within our original 10-kilometer [6.2 mi] zone. As a state we have known the risk for HPAI was high this season. We have seen other states with cases and have known since mid-January [2022] it was present in our wild bird population."

An additional 17 000 turkeys were located at another farm in Wayne county later Friday evening [1 Apr 2022].

The positive samples were identified by the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Diagnostic lab in Raleigh. The samples have been sent to the USDA APHIS National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames, Iowa to confirm the positive result.

The strain's presence has been found in several flocks throughout the country.

The Ag department continues to urge poultry owners to do their part by practicing strict biosecurity and reporting sick or dying birds right away to a local veterinarian, the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Veterinary Division, or the N.C. Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System.

This type of HPAI virus is considered a low risk to people according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, but is highly contagious to other birds, including commercial and backyard flocks of poultry.

https://www.twincities.com/2022/04/01/two-more-minnesota-poultry-flocks-infected-with-avian-influenza-state-says/


Two additional poultry flocks are confirmed infected with avian influenza in Minnesota, according to the state Board of Animal Health.

A backyard flock of 115 unspecified birds in Stearns County, the 2nd diagnosis in the county, and a commercial flock of 52 000 turkeys in Morrison County were confirmed infected with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza on Thursday [31 Mar 2022].

The new infections were reported Friday [1 Apr 2022]. The new confirmations bring the total infected flocks in the state to 7 and the number of birds affected by the outbreak to 378 998.

The 1st cases of H5N1 in Minnesota were confirmed [25 Mar 2022], according to the Board of Animal Health.

The earlier confirmations were in commercial turkey flocks in Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Meeker and Stearns Counties and a backyard flock in Mower County.

Farms raising turkeys and chickens for consumption have been on high alert and taking steps to increase biosecurity since avian influenza was recently discovered in a handful of states.

Avian influenza is an airborne respiratory virus spreading easily among chickens through nasal and eye secretions, as well as manure. The virus can spread from flock to flock by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry.

According to state officials, the current outbreak in Minnesota poses little risk to the public and there is no food safety concern for consumers.

[If possible, keep your flocks inside to protect them from co-mingling with wild birds. And remember you can transport this virus on boots, hands or even your coveralls. Be sure you are in clean gear before entering your birdhouses, and also blow your nose before entering a poultry house and again when leaving the poultry house.

Biosecurity of your flock is hugely important in protecting them. It is not just a word, but an action to protect your flocks.

Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Consequently, please be on alert for the least sign of a bird not feeling well or not eating. Early detection can help limit losses. - Mod.TG]
