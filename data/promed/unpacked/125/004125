[While the number of pigs infected or exposed is not more than what we have
previously seen in this outbreak, the number of new cases is. It is
disconcerting that 7 out of the 17 new cases seen in the current Spanish
epidemic were seen last week. This one is smoldering; I hope next week
brings a return to only one or 2 new cases. - Mod.PC
