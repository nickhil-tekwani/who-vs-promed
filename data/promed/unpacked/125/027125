Nicaragua: Number of Cases Rise; "Dengue Fever Epidemic" declared
--------------------------------------------------
Due to an increase in the number of cases of dengue fever in Nicaragua, the
Ministry of Health (MINSA) has declared a nation-wide state of "dengue
fever epidemic." Up to Thu 24 Oct 2002, health units had confirmed 1366
cases of dengue fever, with 1258 cases of classic dengue fever and 108
cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), from which there have been 7
deaths. Victor Calixto, a MINSA epidemiologist, stated that although the
number of cases to date is lower than that reported for the same period
last year (1807 cases), all efforts are geared towards making people aware
of the dangers posed by the disease so that they will take the necessary
preventive measures to control the epidemic and avoid more fatalities.
According to the official report from the ministry, the cities most
affected by the epidemic are Nueva Segovia (254 confirmed cases), Managua
(219 cases), Chinandega (162 cases), and Leon (134 cases). Nonetheless, the
majority of the cases of DHF have been registered in Masaya (31 cases),
followed by Managua (28 cases), Leon (18 cases), and Nueva Segovia (11 cases).
Last year, the cities with most cases of classic dengue fever were Managua
(258 cases), Chinandega (233 cases), and the Autonomous Region of the South
Atlantic (205 cases). Masaya had the largest number of cases of DHF (68
cases), followed by Leon (32 cases), Managua (27 cases), and Chinandega (17
cases).
Although Calixto maintains that the situation is under control, the number
of patients consulting both health centers and hospitals continues to rise.
The Centro de Salud Francisco Morazan alone has registered an increase of
30 percent in the number of consults, according to its Director, Mauricio
Marin Rosales. Dr. Felix Mairena of the Edgard Lang Health Center in San
Judas, reports that the center has seen an increase of up to 40 percent in
the number of patients consulting for dengue fever.
