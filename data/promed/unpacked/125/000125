Lyme Disease on the rise in MetroWest, Massachusetts
-----------------
A summertime disease once confined to Cape Cod, the islands, and rural
areas of Massachusetts with a large amount of grasses and deer, Lyme
disease is staking its claim in MetroWest. Local physicians and state
public health officials have seen an increase in cases but aren't exactly
sure what is causing the spike.
"It's certainly fair to say Lyme disease is on the rise across the state
especially in counties it hasn't historically been at high levels," said
Melissa Cummings, an epidemiologist at the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health.
Cummings said statistics for Lyme disease cases this year won't be
available until next year, but physicians are reporting more adults and
children visiting their offices with symptoms or concerns.
Dr. Andrew Baumel, a pediatrician in Framingham, MA, said this year is the
first he's ever had patients with Lyme disease. In the last 3 weeks, he
said he's diagnosed 5 patients from towns like Hopkinton, Medway, and
Millis with the disease. "It's amazing," he said. "All of a sudden I'm
seeing everyone with Lyme disease."
Cummings said there's no definitive explanation for the increase in cases
but said a combination of factors are believed to be at play. The disease
is transmitted from animals to humans by deer ticks and is most common in
the Northeast region of the country because the environment is conducive to
the deer tick.
Changes in temperature and moisture in the environment, an increase in the
animal population, more food and water sources for animals and a mild
winter are all factors in the prevalence of the disease in counties across
the state. Last year, the highest rates of Lyme disease (24 cases per 100
000) were in Berkshire, Plymouth, and Barnstable counties as well as the
islands, said Cummings.
Dr. Jonathan Snider, a Hopkinton family physician, said he has seen a 25
percent increase in the number of patients coming to the office with
symptoms of Lyme disease and tick bites.

[Medical practitioners and patients in Massachusetts need to be keep an
increasing watch for Lyme borreliosis. With the 2001-2002 winter being
relatively mild, the reservoirs for the infection (ticks, rodents, and
deer) survived in greater numbers, and this may account for the increasing
recognition. Missing the early manifestations of the infection, such as
the characteristic (but not always seen) erythema migrans, may predispose
the affected but not treated patient to late complications such as
arthritis. - Mod.LL]
