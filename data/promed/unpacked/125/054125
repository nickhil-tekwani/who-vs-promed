http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/africa/66820013/fear-of-ebola-led-to-murder--and-a-whole-village-was-punished
[After the killing of 8 people who were part of a government-led group trying to educate people on Ebola and spraying bleach all over the place, the people of Womey were forced from their town by the military. They lived in the bush for over 6 weeks as the military looted all of their belongings. About 30 of those charged in the killings are locked in a dark, stone-walled jail, awaiting a mass trial that could begin within weeks. If found guilty, they could face life imprisonment or the death penalty.]
