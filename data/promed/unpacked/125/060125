BSE Confirmed In Alberta
-----------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the
diagnosis of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a mature bull
from Alberta. The animal's carcass is under CFIA control, and no part
of it entered the human food or animal feed systems.
Preliminary information indicates that the age of the animal falls
well within the age range of previous cases detected in Canada under
the national BSE surveillance program. This signifies that the animal
was exposed to a very small amount of infective material, most likely
during its 1st year of life.
An epidemiological investigation directed by international guidelines
is underway to examine what the animal was fed early in its life and
to identify its herd mates at the time. All findings will be publicly
released once the investigation concludes.
Under Canada's enhanced feed ban, which comes into effect on 12 Jul
2007, BSE should be eliminated from the national cattle herd within
approximately 10 years. The CFIA expects the periodic detection of a
limited number of cases to continue as the level of BSE continues to decline.
The finding of a mature animal should not impact Canada's BSE country
categorization submission to the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE). The science-based BSE risk-level determination process
requires that a country is able to demonstrate a full understanding
of the pathways that resulted in BSE exposure and expression as well
as the implementation of appropriate comprehensive measures to block
those pathways and protect human and animal health, leading to the
eradication of the disease over time.
The animal was identified at the farm level by the national
surveillance program, which has detected all cases found in Canada.
The program targets the highest risk cattle populations and has
tested roughly 150 000 animals since 2003. The surveillance results
reflect an extremely low incidence of BSE in Canada.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has detected a new case of mad
cow disease in a bull at Alberta, Canada under the national Bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance program. Though this is
the 9th case of mad cow in the country since May 2003, the
authorities have confirmed that none of the animal has entered the
food chain yet. All the animals are believed to have contracted the
disease from contaminated feed.
BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease, is a fatal disease that
causes progressive neurological degeneration in cattle. Similar to
BSE, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare disease that occurs in
humans. In 1996, following outbreaks of BSE among British cattle,
scientists found a possible link between BSE and a new variant of CJD
(vCJD). While it is not certain how BSE may be spread to humans,
evidence indicates that humans may acquire vCJD after consuming
BSE-contaminated cattle products.
According to a CFIA statement, the diseased cow is believed to be
exposed to a very small amount of infective material, most likely
during its 1st year of life. The infected animal was discovered at an
unidentified farm under routine screening of cattle believed to be at
risk of contracting the disease. The CFIA has begun investigating the
source of feed the bull ate early in its life.
In a bid to curb the disease in 1997, Canada banned the inclusion of
protein from ruminants like cattle and sheep in cattle feed that are
believed to be linked to the spread of the disease.
Dennis Laycraft, executive vice-president of the Canadian Cattlemen's
Association, told CanWest news agency, "We know that there's the
likelihood that we'll find a few additional cases, but we're well on
our way to eradication."
Older cattle and their beef products are still banned from the U.S.,
although there are chances of the trade being resumed between the 2
countries. The infection caused an estimated loss of USD 7 billion to
the Canadian cattle industry. The last case of mad cow disease was
detected in August 2006 in northern Alberta.
