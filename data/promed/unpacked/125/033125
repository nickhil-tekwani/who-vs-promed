Rabies in a Dog Imported from Iraq -- New Jersey, June 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rabies vaccination and stray dog control have led to successful
control of canine rabies in the United States. The number of rabid
dogs reported decreased from approximately 5000 in 1950 to 79 in
2006, when the canine rabies virus variant associated with dog-to-dog
rabies transmission was declared eliminated in the United States (1).
On 18 Jun 2008, a mixed-breed dog, recently shipped from Iraq into
the United States, was confirmed to have rabies by the Public Health
and Environmental Laboratories of the New Jersey Department of Health
and Senior Services. A total of 24 additional animals in the
shipment, all potentially exposed to the rabid dog, were distributed
to 16 states. This report summarizes the epidemiologic investigation
by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, Bergen
County Department of Health, and CDC, and the ensuing public health
response. These findings underscore the need for vigilance regarding
rabies (and other zoonotic diseases) during animal importation to
prevent the possible reintroduction and sustained transmission of
canine rabies in U.S. dog populations.

Case Report
-----------
On 5 Jun 2008, a shipment of 24 dogs and 2 cats arrived in the United
States from Iraq as part of an international animal rescue operation.
The goal of the operation was to reunite servicemen returning to the
United States with animals they had adopted in Iraq. Upon arrival at
Newark Liberty International Airport, the animals received physical
examinations from volunteer licensed veterinarians. One cat became
ill with neurologic signs during transport and was euthanized on
arrival. The cat was tested for rabies and was negative. The
remaining 24 dogs and one cat were housed for several days at the
airport before distribution to their final U.S. destinations.

On 8 Jun 2008, one of the 24 dogs, a mixed-breed aged 11 months (dog
A), became ill and was taken to a veterinarian the next day. The dog
was hospitalized with fever, diarrhea, wobbly gait, agitation, and
crying. The dog's condition deteriorated, progressing to lateral
recumbency with periods of agitation. On 11 Jun 2008, the dog was
euthanized. Specimens were shipped to the Public Health and
Environmental Laboratories for rabies testing, but delivery of the
specimens was delayed. On 18 Jun 2008, the specimens were tested, and
rabies was diagnosed. Specimens also were submitted to CDC, where
rabies was confirmed on 26 Jun 2008 and typed as a rabies virus
variant associated with dogs in the Middle East.

Public Health Investigation
---------------------------
The potentially infectious period for a dog, cat, or ferret with
rabies can begin as many as 10 days before the onset of clinical
signs and continue throughout the clinical course until death (2). To
identify potential rabies exposure to humans or other animals while
dog A was in Iraq, during transport, or at the airport shelter, an
investigation was initiated by the New Jersey Department of Health
and Senior Services and the Bergen County Department of Health, with
participation from CDC. The dog was reportedly in the possession of a
U.S. soldier in Baghdad for approximately 7 months before shipment to
the United States. The dog had been kept in an indoor-outdoor run on
a military base and had not been vaccinated for rabies; the owner
reported no signs of illness in the dog or potential exposure to
other rabid animals during the 7 months. The owner also reported no
potential exposures to other persons or animals during the 2 days of
potential infectivity before the dog was transferred to the animal
rescue operation for shipment on 31 May 2008.

Upon arrival in the United States, none of the 24 dogs were
accompanied by the valid rabies vaccination certificates required for
admission by CDC animal importation regulations.* For dogs aged >3
months, a rabies vaccination must be administered at least 30 days
before the date of arrival at a U.S. port. 5 of the 24 dogs (not
including dog A) reportedly had received a previous rabies
vaccination; however, none of the information required for a valid
rabies vaccination certificate was available, including vaccine
manufacturer, lot numbers, or a certifying veterinarian signature. 21
of the animals in the shipment, including dog A, had received a
primary rabies vaccination in Iraq during 28-31 May 2008, immediately
before being shipped to New Jersey. Because none of the dogs met
rabies vaccination requirements for importation, in accordance with
the importation regulation, a confinement agreement was issued by
CDC, stating where the animals would be held for at least 30 days
after vaccination. During shipment and upon arrival in New Jersey,
all the animals were housed in separate crates; however, interviews
with persons present during the animals' arrival and stay in Newark
identified potential periods during which dogs, including dog A, were
allowed to intermingle.

On 10 June 2008, 1 day before dog A was euthanized and 8 days before
rabies was diagnosed, the remaining 23 dogs and one cat were shipped
to destinations in 16 states. Because none of the surviving animals
had a verifiable history of vaccination at least 30 days before their
potential exposure to dog A, CDC recommended immediate vaccination
and a 6-month quarantine for all of them (2). State health
departments in the 16 states were advised of the recommendations.

During the public health investigation, 28 persons were evaluated for
potential rabies exposure; 13 were identified with potential exposure
because of direct contact with possibly infectious saliva (3) and
were recommended to initiate rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
All 23 dogs and one cat were located by state and local health
authorities within 2 weeks of the rabies diagnosis. No clinical signs
consistent with rabies were reported in the animals during 20 days of
follow-up. All 24 animals continue to be monitored during the 6-month
quarantine period.

Editorial Note:
---------------
Canine rabies virus variants most commonly are imported via
unvaccinated dogs from areas where rabies is enzootic, such as Asia,
Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Latin America, where canine
variants are responsible for most of the 55 000 human rabies deaths
estimated worldwide each year (4).

In May 2004, an unvaccinated puppy was flown from Puerto Rico to
Massachusetts as part of an animal rescue program. The day after
arrival, the puppy exhibited neurologic signs, was euthanized, and
was subsequently confirmed to have rabies; 6 persons were recommended
to receive PEP because of potential exposure.

In June 2004, an unvaccinated puppy adopted by a U.S. resident in
Thailand was confirmed to have rabies by the California Department of
Public Health. Of 40 persons interviewed for potential rabies
exposure, 12 received PEP.

In March 2007, a puppy adopted by a U.S. veterinarian while
volunteering in India was confirmed to have rabies by the Alaska
Department of Health and Social Services. The puppy was flown in
cargo to Seattle, Washington, then adopted by another veterinarian in
Juneau, Alaska, where it was flown 7 days after arrival. Of 20
persons interviewed for potential rabies exposure, 8 received PEP (5,6).

In all 3 cases, the rabies virus variant was typed as a variant
circulating in dogs and terrestrial wildlife in the animal's country
of origin (i.e., mongoose and canine rabies virus variants enzootic
in Puerto Rico, Thailand, and India, respectively).
This report reiterates the need for education of the public regarding
rabies incidence in other countries and preventing rabies exposure.
While traveling in areas that are endemic for rabies, travelers
should not pet stray animals. In addition, travelers should not adopt
stray animals without acquiring a veterinarian's health assessment
and ensuring proper animal vaccination for importation. Travelers
also should consider their potential for rabies exposure from
animals, understand proper wound management, and promptly report
animal bites to health-care providers (7). Health information for
travelers is available at
<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/contentyellowbook.aspx>.

The CDC administers federal importation regulations for dogs. These
regulations allow admittance of unvaccinated dogs aged <3 months,
provided the importer signs an agreement to vaccinate the dog at age
3 months and confine the animal for 30 days after the vaccination.
Dogs aged >3 months that have not been vaccinated for rabies also
must be confined until vaccinated and for 3 months after vaccination.
Upon arrival in the United States, importers should declare animals
to federal authorities and comply with those requirements for
confinement of unvaccinated puppies.

The CDC's regulations were created in the early 1950s to guide
persons importing dogs or cats as their personal pets. However,
recent trends in dog importations have shown an increase in the
numbers of animals being imported for commercial pet trade (8). CDC
is working to update current regulations and better address the
importation of dogs. In July 2007, the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services posted an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to
begin the process of revising CDC's animal importation regulations,
including those that apply to dogs and other companion animals

2008, 1 day before dog A was euthanized and 8 days before rabies was
diagnosed, the remaining 23 dogs and one cat were shipped to
destinations in 16 states more than *3 weeks prior* to the end of
the required quarantine period. - Rapp.JD]

[The summary presented by the Rapporteur only begs the question of
how and why were the animals released from quarantine? - Mod.TG]
