Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 93
--------------------------------
As of Sun 21 Mar 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 16 931 deaths.

Situation update
----------------
The most active areas of pandemic influenza virus transmission
currently are in parts of Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the
tropical zone of the Americas. After a period of sustained pandemic
influenza transmission in Thailand over the past 2 months, overall
activity now appears to be decreasing. In West Africa, limited data
suggest that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists
without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Central America and
in the tropical zone of South America, an increasing trend of
respiratory disease activity associated with circulation of pandemic
influenza virus has been reported since early March 2010 in an
increasing number of countries. Although pandemic influenza virus
continues to be the predominant influenza virus circulating
worldwide, seasonal influenza B viruses are predominate in East Asia,
and have been increasingly detected at low levels across southeast
and western Asia, eastern Africa, and in parts of Europe.

In Southeast Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission has remained
active and geographically widespread in Thailand since mid February
2010 and has been increasing since early March in Malaysia. In
Thailand, the overall intensity of respiratory disease activity was
reported to be low to moderate, and activity now appears to be
decreasing since mid March [2010]; 10-22 percent of sentinel
respiratory samples from patients with ILI [influenza-like illness]
tested positive for pandemic influenza during the most recent
reporting week. In Malaysia, limited data suggest increasing
detections of pandemic H1N1 cases over the past 2 weeks, although the
extent and severity of illness is not currently known. Low numbers of
seasonal influenza B viruses continue to be isolated in Thailand and
in other parts of Southeast Asia.

In South Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission remains variable
across the subcontinent. In Bangladesh, an increasing trend in
respiratory disease activity and increasing detections of H1N1 cases
has been reported since late February 2010; however, overall
intensity of disease activity remains low. In India, although overall
pandemic influenza activity remains low, pandemic H1N1 cases continue
be reported in Western India.

In East Asia, pandemic influenza virus transmission has declined
substantially. Rates of ILI/ARI [acute respiratory infection] have
returned to near baseline in Japan and Republic of Korea. In China,
although overall ILI and pandemic influenza virus circulation has
decreased substantially, circulation of seasonal influenza B viruses
continues to be active (accounting for approximately 85 percent of
all influenza viruses isolated during recent weeks). Similarly, in
Mongolia, after experiencing a 1st peak of ILI activity due to
circulation of pandemic influenza virus during November 2009, a 2nd
recent sharp peak of ILI activity occurred during late February and
early March 2010 exclusively as a result circulating seasonal
influenza B viruses. Overall influenza activity continues to remain
low in Hong Kong SAR (China), Chinese Taipei, and DPR Korea.

In Sub-Saharan Africa, pandemic influenza activity remains variable.
Limited data suggest that the most active areas of pandemic influenza
virus transmission continue to be in West Africa and in limited areas
of East Africa, particularly in Rwanda. 27 percent of respiratory
specimens in Ghana, and 47 percent of specimens in Rwanda, tested
positive for pandemic influenza virus during mid March 2010. In
Senegal, a high intensity of respiratory diseases activity was
reported in association with increased detections of pandemic
influenza virus. Pandemic influenza virus continues to be the
predominant influenza virus circulating in West and East Africa,
however, small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 and seasonal
influenza B viruses have also been identified.

In tropical zone of the Americas overall influenza activity remains
low, however, active transmission of pandemic influenza virus may be
increasing, particularly across Central America and parts of South
America. An increasing trend of respiratory diseases activity
associated with detections of pandemic influenza virus was reported
in Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Panama. In Brazil, 3
consecutive weeks of increases in respiratory diseases activity have
been associated with regional spread of pandemic influenza virus; 3
states in northern Brazil reported increases in detections of
confirmed cases, however, the extent and severity of cases is not yet
know. In Mexico, 2 weeks of increases (11-14 percent per week) in ILI
and SARI [severe acute respiratory infection] were reported during
late February and early March 2010, however, the extent to which
respiratory disease activity has been due to pandemic influenza virus
is not yet known.

In Europe, overall pandemic influenza virus transmission continued to
decline or remain low in most countries. Of note, over 20 percent of
sentinel specimens in Germany, Italy, and the Russian Federation
tested positive for influenza, however, these increased sentinel
detections of influenza virus were not associated with significant
increases in overall rates of acute respiratory illness; in Italy and
the Russian Federation, seasonal influenza B viruses were either
dominant or co-dominant with pandemic H1N1, respectively. In Romania
and in Poland, recent increases in rates of ILI or ARI have not been
associated with increased detections of pandemic or other influenza viruses.

In North Africa and Western Asia, limited data suggest that pandemic
influenza virus continues to circulate at low levels, as overall
disease activity remained low across much of the region.

In the northern and the southern temperate zones of the Americas,
overall pandemic influenza transmission remained low as influenza
virus continues to circulate at low levels.

In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza
activity remained low, with sporadic detections of pandemic and
seasonal influenza viruses.

The Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN) continues monitoring
the global circulation of influenza viruses, including pandemic,
seasonal, and other influenza viruses infecting, or with the
potential to infect humans, including seasonal influenza. For more
information on virological surveillance and antiviral resistance
please see the weekly virology update [For more information on

Region / Deaths*
----------------
WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) / 167
WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) / at least 7673
WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) / 1019
WHO Regional Office for Europe (EURO) / at least 4637
WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia (SEARO) / 1709
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WPRO) / 1726
Total* / at least 16 931

* The reported number of fatal cases is an under representation of
the actual numbers as many deaths are never tested or recognized as
influenza related.

[A new feature of the weekly updates is a map of influenza activity
and virus subtypes, accessible at
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/Global_influenzapositive_FluTransmissionZones_week05.png>.
The displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to Flunet
(<http://gamapserver.who.int/GlobalAtlas/home.asp>), WHO regional
offices, or on Ministry of health websites in the preceding 2 weeks.

Perhaps the most significant feature of the current update is that
although pandemic influenza virus continues to be the predominant
circulating influenza virus worldwide, there has been an overall
decline in frequency of this influenza virus and seasonal influenza B
viruses have been increasingly detected in Asia and appear to be
spreading westward. - Mod.CP]
