2004/004 -- 1st report of _Ralstonia solanacearum_ in Slovakia
The NPPO of Slovakia recently reported the 1st findings of _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ [Rs] EPPO A2 list) on plants of _Solanum tuberosum_on its
territory. All necessary measures have been taken to prevent spread and to
eradicate the bacterium. The findings are located in 5 contiguous cadastral
territories: Turen, Senec, Kralova pri Senci, Novy Svet (all of them in the
district of Senec) Puste Ulany (district of Galanta), and at another
cadastral territory (Radvan nad Dunajom) in the district of Komarno. These
findings were confirmed by IF, PCR and RFLP tests. The source of infected
potatoes is currently being investigated. It is assumed that the original
seed potatoes (cvs. Agria, Impala, Provento, Amorosa and Red Scarlet) were
imported from EU member states.
The situation of Rs in Slovakia can be described as follows: 1st reported
in 2004, in 6 localities in the districts of Senec, Galanta and Komarno,
under eradication.

[The host range of Rs is very wide. There are several races and biovars of
Rs, of which race 3 (biovar 2A) is of most concern to plant pathologists.
Most Rs races are adapted to warmer regions, but race 3 (biovar 2A), while
not known to be present in Canada or the United States, has appeared in the
more temperate regions of Europe, primarily on potato and tomato as well as
on some weed species which would serve as inoculum sources.
Bacterial wilt of potato has been estimated to affect about 3.75 million
acres in around 80 countries, with global damage estimates currently
exceeding $950 million per annum Consequently, race 3 (biovar 2A) is listed
as a quarantine pest in Canada, Europe and the United States. Of major
significance is that race 3 infects also geranium (_Pelargonium_ spp.), and
infected plants have entered the flower trade.
Disease management requires regular disinfection of all hand implements,
use of disinfectant foot baths at entry points to each production
glasshouse, washing of hands, wear newly laundered clothing daily, destroy
weeds that are potential hosts of Rs in and around glasshouses, and use
effective disinfectants such as quaternary ammonia, peroxygen compounds and
bleach.
