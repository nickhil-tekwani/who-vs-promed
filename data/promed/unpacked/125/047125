A young Johannesburg girl has died, possibly after contracting rabies,
Gauteng agriculture and rural development MEC Nandi Mayathula-Khoza
said on Monday [27 Sep 2010].

The child, aged below 10, from Dobsonville, Soweto, died on [Sat 25
Sep 2010] at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital of symptoms similar to
those of rabies. She had a history of being bitten by dogs. Khoza said
it had not been confirmed yet whether she died of rabies. The case had
been handed to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases for
investigation.

Khoza was speaking at the start of a rabies vaccination drive at the
Kopanong community centre in Dobsonville, where people could bring
their animals to be vaccinated for free at a mobile SPCA clinic. The
campaign would be rolled out across Soweto until 22 Oct 2010. It was
prompted by a rabies outbreak in Southern and Western Johannesburg.

Rabies is a viral infection of the nervous system that affects all
mammals and is fatal once symptoms appear.

[It is unclear from this report if the victim had received
post-exposure prophylaxis. A time- and location-limited canine
vaccination drive seems a rather inadequate response. Further
information would be welcomed.
