[The above information is complementary to the information included in posting 20130130.1521116 and is the outcome of ProMED-mail's request for information in posting 20130127.1517331. Information on the veterinary certification for exports from the Netherlands to various countries is available at the Dutch nVWA website http://tinyurl.com/av4wdd4. This relates to live breeding cattle (26 target countries), bovine embryos (5 target countries), and bull-semen (29 target countries).

Some of the target countries have published specified requirements in relation to SBV, including tests (in brackets, date of initial publication):

1. Live breeding cattle: Algeria (14 Jan 2013), Azerbaijan (9 Oct 2012), Egypt (24 Jan 2013), Kuwait (6 Sep 2012), Morocco (6 Jun 2012), Sudan (30 Aug 2012), and Tunisia (9 Aug 2012). Lebanon published (26 Nov 2012) a general requirement: "In all cases, the animals are attached with an attestation that they came from herds that are not infected with Schmallenberg virus;" no tests required.

Several countries, such as Jordan (28 Jan 2012), the Russian Federation (31 Jan 2012), and Ukraine (4 Feb 2012) have temporarily banned imports of live cattle.

2. Bovine semen: Japan, Morocco and Peru (all, 28 Jan 2013; see items 1, 2, 3 above). Kazakhstan (27 Feb 2012), Russia (1 Feb 2012), and Ukraine (2 Feb 2012) have temporarily banned imports of bovine semen due to SBV considerations.

Japan and USA (both 27 Feb 2012) temporarily banned the imports of bovine embryos.

The Dutch transparency is commendable; similar information from other exporting countries, known to be SBV-infected, will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
