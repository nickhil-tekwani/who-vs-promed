Namibia says polio cases rise sharply
-------------------------------------------
Namibia's 1st outbreak of polio in more than a decade has killed 15,
and the number of cases has risen sharply to 96, the health minister
said on the eve of a mass vaccination campaign.
"I am saddened to report that the number has risen to 96 polio
cases," Richard Kamwi told parliament, adding: "The death cases from
the polio outbreak [have] risen to 15 by today [21 Jun 2006]."
Namibia will on Wednesday [21 Jun 2006] launch a mass vaccination
program countrywide to inoculate its 2-million population over a
period of 3 days with vaccines supplied by the UN children's agency UNICEF.
Experts from the World Health Organization are in Namibia to help
stamp out the disease that can damage the nervous system and cause paralysis.
The 1st case was detected on [6 May 2006]; tests conducted in South
Africa [confirmed] that it was polio.

Outbreak Update: Namibia
-----------------------------
21 Jun 2006* - The 1st of 3 planned National Immunization Days (NIDs)
starts in Namibia today, following an outbreak of poliovirus
affecting mostly adults. The entire population of the country -- 2
million people -- will be given vaccine over the next 3 days.
Namibia had not had cases of polio since 1996. Currently, over 100
suspect cases with sudden paralysis are under investigation, of which
13 have been reported to be wild poliovirus. What is thought to be
the 1st case is a 39-year old man, with onset of paralysis on 8 May
[2006], later confirmed as infected with wild poliovirus type-1
[WPV-1]. Three-quarters of the suspect cases are over 15 years old;
14 of the individuals have died.
Genetic sequencing confirms that the virus is consistent with an
importation from Angola, of Indian origin. Angola, polio-free since
2001, was re-infected last year [2005] by a virus from India.
The Government's immunization response consists of 3 NIDs, using 2.5
million doses of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). Both
the 1st and 2nd NIDs will aim to reach the entire population of the
country rather than the usual under-5 year population.
Namibia began routine immunization for polio in 1990. While the cause
of the largely adult outbreak is yet to be determined, it is likely
that those who fell ill did not receive immunization as children.
Routine immunization coverage within Namibia today varies by region
from 60 percent to 80 percent.
* Data as of 20 Jun 2006, according to the Ministry of Health and
Social Services of Namibia. This data will be reflected in the WHO
weekly case count of 28 Jun [2006].

[The rationale for including the entire population of the country as
the target population for the national immunization days is based on
the age distribution of the cases. As mentioned in earlier postings
on this outbreak, the age range of the cases extends from early
childhood to adulthood, with a number of cases over 50 years of age.
This observation strongly suggests that there were significant
numbers of either unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated individuals
in older age groups. In countries where vaccination activities were
adequate enough to limit transmission of the wild poliovirus (WPV),
one had the situation in which small pockets of susceptibles were
protected by the larger groups of vaccinated populations surrounding
them (also known as "herd immunity"). Thus, the pre-vaccine era norm
of widespread circulation of WPV led to exposure to the virus at an
early age so that by early adulthood (ages 18 or over) most
individuals had protective antibodies against the WPV's from natural
exposure at a young age (again a reminder that the majority of
infections with WPV do not result in paralysis, with the observed
paralytic to non-paralytic infection ratios of 1:50 to 1:1000). Thus,
it appears as though in Namibia, the herd immunity was effective in
preventing introductions of WPV from reaching the smaller pockets of
susceptibles through the years. But with time, these pockets of
susceptibles grow in size, and unfortunately a reintroduction of the
WPV, most probably from Angola, did lead to seemingly widespread
transmission of the WPV with a resultant fairly significant size
outbreak/epidemic affecting all age groups.
Similar epidemiologic situations have occurred in the past in the
Netherlands (1978 and 1992/1993) and the United States and Canada
(1978/1979), where populations of individuals not accepting
vaccinations based on religious objections have had WPV introduction
into their communities, leading to outbreaks of polio with cases in
all age groups (see refs below). Control measures in these instances
involved offering vaccinations to all susceptible age groups. In the
case of the 1979 outbreak in the Netherlands, the prior outbreak had
been 27 years earlier, and the majority of the cases that year were
in the less-than-27-year-old population.
We look forward to more information from official sources on the
epidemiology of this ongoing outbreak in Namibia.

According to the polio eradication website, there have been 2 cases
of wild poliovirus polio reported in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. Both cases are listed as importation related. The most date
of onset for the most recent case was 24 Apr 2006.

[More information on the WPVs isolated in both the DRC and in Niger
would be greatly appreciated. Remembering that while the majority of
importation in the past 24 months have been identified as genetically
related to the WPV circulating in Nigeria, the WPV responsible for
the outbreak in Angola, and now Namibia was genetically related to
WPVs circulating in India. - Mod.MPP]
