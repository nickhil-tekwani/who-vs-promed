6 more cases of legionnaires' disease announced
-----------------------------------------------
The Westchester County Department of Health announced today, 19 Jul 2005,
that 6 additional cases of legionnaires' disease have been identified in
New Rochelle, bringing the total number of cases up to 18 since 21 Jun 2005.
Other patients with pneumonia are also currently under investigation as
possible cases of legionnaires' disease. All patients thus far appear to
have been exposed through an outdoor cooling tower located on the grounds
of Sound Shore Medical Center. In previous years only 7 to 10 cases of
legionnaires' disease have been reported countywide annually.
Preliminary investigation by the New York State Department of Health and
the Westchester County Department of Health indicates that a possible
source of contamination may be an outdoor cooling tower on the campus of
the Sound Shore Medical Center. At this time, this cooling tower has been
removed from the Medical Center's premises and a replacement unit has been
installed. Water samples cultured from the hospital's cooling tower last
week indicated the presence of legionella bacteria, and follow-up testing
is being conducted. Other sources of legionella contamination also continue
to be investigated.
John Spicer, president and CEO of Sound Shore Medical Center, assured
patients and staff that the Sound Shore Medical Center has taken and
continues to take every precaution to assure the health and safety of staff
and patients. Mr Spicer also noted that additional measures were instituted
when the hospital became aware of the possibility that the cooling tower
may be a source. These measures included chlorination of the cooling tower,
addition of biocide to reduce the biofilm level, and the replacement of the
tower on Fri, 15 Jul 2005. The tower had been previously tested in May 2005
and was found to be negative for legionella.
The patients identified to date all have underlying medical conditions or
risk factors for developing legionnaires' disease and range in age from 39
to 83 years. 12 of the 18 cases have been discharged from the hospital and
are recovered or recovering at home. The other 6 cases remain hospitalized
and are in stable condition.

[The total number of cases has doubled since the initial posting.
Nosocomial (hospital acquired) legionellosis is well known. These cases are
hospital acquired but from the hospital grounds. Perhaps the term could be
expanded to endonosocomial (in the hospital) and exonosocomial (outside the
hospital). - Mod.LL]
