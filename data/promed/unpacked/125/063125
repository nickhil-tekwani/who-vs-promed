Bovine tuberculosis has been confirmed in a Tripp County beef herd.

The infected cow was identified by meat inspectors during a routine inspection in October 2017 at a Texas slaughterhouse, and official records linked the cow to a Tripp County herd, according to State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven.

Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic respiratory disease of cattle, and infected animals can transmit the infection to other animals in close proximity.

"We are working closely with the affected herd owner, (United States Department of Agriculture) officials, area veterinarians, neighboring herd owners, and wildlife officials to evaluate the extent of the disease," Oedekoven said in a press release.

Officials' investigation will look to determine the source of the infection, and precautions have been put in place to protect the health of the state's cattle industry, Oedekoven said.

[Cases of bovine TB were found in South Dakota in Hardings and Butte counties earlier this year (February 2017). Is this case a trace out from one of these herds?

Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph node enlargement may also be present."

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.

We will be interested to see how this investigation develops. Likely, the South Dakota officials will be busy with the traces into the herd as well as to those animals having left the herd. Tracking these animals can help control the outbreak of this disease. - Mod.TG
