NEOSPORA CANINUM, DOGS ARE DEFINITIVE HOSTS

David Lindsay and colleagues at the Center for Molecular Medicine and
Infectious Disease, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary
Medicine, have demonstrated that the dog is a "definitive host" for_
Neospora caninum_, a single-celled parasitic organism which causes
abortions in cattle.
While the dog was suspected to be a definitive host for _Neospora caninum_
it remained unconfirmed ever since the organism was identified in 1988 by
USDA microbiologist Jitender Dubey. It was subsequently isolated in cell
culture by Lindsay, who was then with the USDA.
_Neospora caninum_ sporozoites, a life stage which follows oocysts, spread
throughout the host's body, penetrating intestinal walls and/or central
nervous system tissues. The parasite can cause central nervous system
disorders in horses and dogs, in addition to abortions in cattle.
In California _Neospora_ is believed to be a cause of cattle abortions,
estimated to cause some $35 million a year in economic losses. The parasite
passes through cattle populations as dogs or other wildlife ingest
placental tissues or aborted fetuses and consequently shed
oocyst-contaminated feces. These oocysts are then ingested by other
ruminants, which allows the parasite to continue its life cycle.
Besides domestic and stray dogs, coyotes and foxes are believed to also
harbor the organism, Lindsay said. As a result of the discovery, the
scientific team recommended that producers use fences and adopt cattle
management strategies designed to keep pet and stray dogs from defecating
in dairy feedlots or pastures. [They did not propose how much this fencing
would cost the producer or the reality/practically of such fencing for
large operations. TG] The work was published in the August 14, 1998, issue
of the International Journal of Parasitology.
Lindsay and the other researchers have drawn their conclusions from
experimental work in which the parasite was successfully passed from a
group of _Neospora_ infected mice, through a dog that passed oocysts, and
into another group of experimental mice. Oocytes are protected by extremely
durable capsules -- so tough they can withstand bleach -- and the only
thing that destroys them is high temperatures and extreme dryness, Lindsay
said.
People are not believed to be susceptible to _Neospora_, Lindsay says,
although experimentally infected primates have demonstrated their
suitability as host organisms.

[While the discovery provides sound scientific justification for their
cattle management recommendations, it is doubtful whether they are cost
effective or reality based. From their experimental design perhaps these
researchers should examine the cost/practicality of fencing to prohibit
entrance of all forms of wildlife, including mice, into the pastures and
pens of dairy cattle/beef cattle. The researchers make reference to other
wildlife, but ostensibly their work has not been tested in raccoons or
cats, which are both seen with some degree of frequency around some
dairies. - Mod.TG]
