The Plant Protection Research Institute (PPRI) of the Agricultural
Research Council (ARC) has recently been surveying honeybee colonies
and retail honey in South Africa for the presence of American foul
brood (AFB), an extremely serious brood disease of honeybees, as a
project for the national Department of Agriculture (DoA).

This disease, caused by the spore-forming bacterium _Paenibacillus
larvae_, has thus far never been reported in sub-Saharan Africa. In
other parts of the world AFB has caused large-scale colony losses and
as it is extremely contagious and very difficult to eradicate, has
been the subject of extensive eradication and control programmes.
This is the major reason why honey and other honeybee products
entering South Africa are required by law to be irradiated, in an
effort to prevent the disease from entering the local honeybee population.

Unfortunately, AFB has now been found in some colonies and apiaries
in the Western Cape. At present it is not known exactly how serious
or extensive the disease outbreak is, but there may be the potential
for a full scale AFB outbreak in South Africa, so the Department of
Agriculture may have to act accordingly and take the necessary
precautionary measures to prevent this.

Accordingly, the Department of Agriculture will conduct an urgent yet
extensive delimiting survey of the Western Cape to determine how
widespread and widespread the AFB infection is and particularly,
whether it is also present in the wild honeybee population. This
survey will be conducted in collaboration with the ARC-PPRI, relevant
Department of Agriculture role players and beekeepers.

Once the extent and distribution of the AFB presence is known, the
Department of Agriculture in consultation with organized beekeeping
and other stakeholders in SA will decide on the appropriate course of
action to be followed.

As a contingency measure, beekeepers are strongly urged to adapt
extreme precautionary measures so as not to spread the disease
further and to prevent their apiaries from contracting the disease.
This applies to all beekeepers in South Africa, but particularly
those in the Western Cape. The suggested measures are as follows:

- Beekeepers should endeavour to keep all apiaries distinct from each
other, that is, do not move honeybee colonies from apiary to apiary.
- Beekeepers should not place their colonies in the near proximity of
colonies belonging to other beekeepers.
- Do not move equipment (brood boxes, supers, frames) from apiary to
apiary, or from colony to colony.
- Sterilise all beekeeping equipment (hive tools, gloves) with
alcohol or boiling water after use, so as not to spread the infection
from apiary to apiary or from colony to colony.
- Do not put out wet supers for bees to feed from.
- Do not feed colonies with anything containing honey or pollen.
- Keep honey robbing to an absolute minimum and hence, keep
beekeeping management to a minimum.
- Beeswax should not be moved in or from the Western Cape and
producers of wax foundation should not accept wax from the Western
Cape and should not sell foundation that might have wax from the Western Cape.

Beekeepers who consider that their colonies are either infected with
AFB or that colonies have shown any extreme foul brood symptoms in
the past 6 months, are urged to contact Dr Mike Allsopp
<allsoppm@arc.agric.za> to arrange for colony inspection or
alternatively Mr Jan Hendrik Venter <janhendrikv@nda.agric.za>

Typical signs of AFB are discoloured and sunken brood, with the
diseased larvae or pupae forming a black or brown scale at the bottom
of the cell, and with the diseased larvae having a muscous like
(non-granular) texture and being extremely ropy, before it dries to
form a hard scale. Entire brood frames can be affected, giving the
frames a shotgun-like appearance, and badly infected colonies are
likely to collapse and die.

The bacterium that causes AFB does not affect people and therefore is
not a danger to human health. This is a disease of insects,
specifically of honeybees. It kills off the young, developing,
non-adult stages of honeybees (namely the bee larvae and pupae that
are still sealed in the brood cells of the comb in the bee hive).

[American foul brood (AFB), caused by the spore-forming bacterium
_Bacillus larvae_, is the most widespread and destructive of the bee
brood diseases. Larvae up to 3 days old become infected by ingesting
spores that are present in their food. Spores germinate in the gut of
the larva and the vegetative form begins to grow, taking its
nourishment from the larva. Spores will not germinate in larvae over
3 days old. Bacterial growth causes the eventual death of the larva.
The vegetative form of the bacterium will die but not before it
produces many millions of spores. Each dead larva may contain as many
as 100 million spores.

Disease spreads rapidly throughout the hive as the bees, attempting
to remove the spore-laden dead larvae, contaminate brood food. Nectar
stored in contaminated cells will contain spores and soon the brood
chamber becomes filled with contaminated honey. As this honey is
moved up into the supers, the entire hive becomes contaminated with
spores. When the colony becomes weak from AFB infection, robber bees
may enter and take contaminated honey back to their hives thereby
spreading the disease to other colonies and apiaries. Beekeepers also
may spread disease by moving equipment (frames or supers) from
contaminated hives to healthy ones.

American foul brood spores are extremely resistant to desiccation and
can remain viable for more than 40 years in honey and beekeeping
equipment. Therefore honey from an unknown source should never be
used as bee feed, and used beekeeping equipment should be assumed
contaminated unless known to be otherwise.

Terramycin (oxytetracycline) is the only drug approved for use
against American foul brood. When present in the food given to
susceptible larvae this antibiotic is effective in preventing
germination of AFB spores. The bees are then able to develop and
mature normally. Terramycin will not kill the spores and is not a
means for sterilizing either the bees or the equipment. If a colony
contains AFB spores and is maintained in a healthy condition through
treatment with terramycin, the disease will recur when the drug
treatment is discontinued.

To treat a diseased colony, apply 3 to 4 treatments of the TM-sugar
mixture at about weekly intervals. If these treatments must be done
during the summer with the honey supers on, they should be left on
the colony over the winter for bee feed because the terramycin will
get into the honey supers and therefore contaminate the honey.
Diseased colonies that do not respond to 3 or 4 treatments of
terramycin should be destroyed.

Diseased colonies that must be destroyed can be killed with
resmethrin insecticide that comes in an aerosol can and is available
from bee supply dealers. Bees should be killed at a time when there
is no flight. The frames and combs should be burned in a pit and the
ashes covered. The heavy woodenware (supers, tops and bottoms, etc)
may be sterilized by scraping them clean (the scrapings should be
burned) and scorching the inside surfaces. The scorching can be done
with a propane torch; particular attention must be paid to cracks and
corners. If large quantities of supers are to be scorched they may be
stacked and painted inside with kerosene and lit. Keep a cover handy
to extinguish the flames when the wood is sufficiently scorched. To
sterilize large quantities of equipment, it might be worthwhile to
set up a barrel with a boiling lye solution of 1 lb. of lye to 10
gallons of water. The woodenware should be immersed in the solution
and boiled 5 to 10 minutes or until clean. Frames may also be
sterilized in this manner. Lye is a very caustic solution; use
extreme care in this process.

Most beekeepers who have had any experience with AFB in their hives
will agree that the best approach is to treat with terramycin on a
preventative basis and inspect colonies regularly. Colonies that show
signs of AFB should be destroyed and the equipment sterilized.

No method of treatment for AFB is completely effective for permanent
control. Beekeepers should inspect their colonies regularly and
always be alert for possible recurrence.
