Fiji is an island nation in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about 2000 km (1300 miles) north east of New Zealand's North Island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji). Fiji is divided into 4 major divisions: Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western. For a map of Fiji's divisions, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fiji_divisions_named.png. Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/fiji/weather). However, the Fiji Meteorological Service has issued a flood alert on Sat 13 Aug 2016 for all low-lying areas, small streams and flood-prone areas adjacent to major rivers for the whole of Fiji with the rainy weather (http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=366177). - Mod.ML
