[Posting delayed in vain hope of getting virology results - Mod.JW

Reports of deer killed by EHD virus have increased in northern Missouri, and
veterinarians have found that some cattle in the region are showing similar
symptoms that might be attributed to epizootic hemorrhagic disease.
"It's widespread across northern Missouri," state veterinarian John Hunt
said. "I've talked to vets in Mexico, Monroe City, Kirksville, Palmyra,
Trenton -- the northern tiers of counties. One veterinarian called me and
said she had seen a handful of these cases in eight or 10 years of practice
but has seen more than that in the last few weeks."
Veterinarians at Missouri University's large animal clinic have examined
five cows that had those symptoms and tested positive either for the
hemorrhagic disease or a genetically similar infection known as bluetongue
virus. Two of the infected cows were from around Kirksville, two were from
near Moberly and the fifth was from a farm about 30 miles north of Columbia.
"We don't see the severity of the disease that you would in deer," said Jeff
Lakritz, associate professor of veterinary science. Still, "several vets
have told me that some cows were looking pretty sick, and it looked like
they were going to have to put them down."
Dead deer attributed to the virus have been reported in 17 Missouri
counties, up from 12 counties two weeks ago. Lonnie Hansen, a wildlife
biologist with the state
Department of Conservation, said the increase was "probably due to better
reporting."
In recent weeks, deer have been reported dead or dying from the virus in
Boone, Cole, Callaway, Howard, Randolph, Mercer, Grundy, Daviess, Adair,
Macon, Chariton, Putnam, Linn, Jackson, Miller, Camden and Carter counties.
Ten years ago, the virus wiped out an estimated 10,000 deer in Missouri --
up to 20 percent of the wild herd in some counties. That outbreak was
concentrated in the southeast quadrant of the state.
"When you have an outbreak of EHD in deer, it is not uncommon for cows to be
affected," said David Stallknecht, a University of Georgia wildlife
epidemiologist who is working with Missouri officials to study the deer
fatalities. Stallknecht said such outbreaks have occurred "pretty much
throughout the Southeast," though cattle in southeastern states apparently
have developed an immunity. Outbreaks in deer and cows have coincided in
West Virginia in 1993 and Indiana in 1996, Stallknecht said. "Where this has
affected cows is on the northern range of this virus in the U.S." Tests have
shown that about one-third of infected deer die, one-third develop nonfatal
symptoms and one-third show no symptoms, said Stallknecht.
The Missouri conservation agency said that symptoms in deer include
weakness, open sores or swelling of the mouth and tongue and bleeding from
mouth, nose, eyes or rectum. Infected cattle show excessive salivation,
weakness, stiffness or lameness
or sores on the tongue, mouth and hooves, Hunt said. Infected cattle can be
treated with antibiotics and an analgesic, Lakritz said.
---
[Until the virology is done there is no knowing whether this is EHDv in
cattle or merely a coincident series of outbreaks of bovine bluetongue/blue
tongue (Charlie insists on the former, I was brought up on the latter). We
have had a number of similar reports as this from individuals in Missouri,
which I had passed to folk at MU veterinary college for comment but have
received no replies, informed or otherwise. If anyone does have any hard
data on the cause(s) of the bovine illness, it would be appreciated if they
would share it with us. If any of you can grab Dave Stallknecht (with my
best wishes) and get him to comment, that would also be appreciated -

Mortality rising from virus in deer
Whitetail deaths spread to 25 counties in Missouri
-------------------------------------------------------------
By George Mazurak of the Tribune's staff [edited, MHJ
Deaths of virus-infected deer have spread to 25 Missouri counties, and
mortality in some places could rival losses 10 years ago, when an estimated
10 000 wild deer in the state died. "In some counties, it seems every bit as
bad as it was" in 1988, "if not more so," said biologist Lonnie Hansen of
the Missouri Department of Conservation.
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus exists naturally in wild deer but
periodically has resulted in fatal outbreaks in Missouri and other states.
Those EHD outbreaks have coincided with the outbreak of similar, though
mostly nonfatal, illnesses in cattle. This year's EHD outbreak in deer has
spurred the state conservation agency to begin a 10-year study to learn how
widespread EHD occurs in wild deer and why some deer don't develop symptoms
from the virus but others do.
Next month, during the 11-day firearms season for deer, conservation agents
plan to draw 1000 to 1500 blood samples from carcasses brought by hunters
to check-in stations, Hansen said. Agents will take a smaller number of
samples from deer carcasses in years when there is no significant outbreak
of EHD. Hansen said that EHD seems to be having the most severe impact in
Daviess, Grundy, Putnam, Linn, Macon and Adair counties in North-central
Missouri. Other deer infected with EHD have been reported in Boone, Audrain,
Callaway, Howard, Andrew, DeKalb, Harrison, Livingston, Mercer, Sullivan,
Chariton, Randolph, Schuyler, Scotland, Cole, Jackson, Crawford and on the
border of Pike and Ralls counties. All but three of the counties are north
of the Missouri River.
Researchers are studying the relationship between EHD in deer and symptoms
of bluetongue virus or EHD in cattle. Tests at the MU Veterinary Medical
Diagnostic Lab have been inconclusive regarding the origin of EHD in cattle
or whether bluetongue virus in cattle might somehow have been affected by
EHD in deer. The lab conducted virology tests on 10 cows from eight counties
and found the virus in two cows, one each from Monroe and Harrison counties.
The MU lab found that serology tests [which don't always separate clearly
between BT & EHD antibodies were positive for EHD in 17 of 25 cows,
including the two cows that had EHD-positive virology tests. Efforts are
under way to grow the virus in some of the 17 cases to determine whether
they had been exposed to EHD or bluetongue, said veterinary science
associate professor Peg Miller. But the process takes a couple of weeks and
is not always successful.
