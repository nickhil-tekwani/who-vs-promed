Ministry of Health officials yesterday [27 Mar 2011] urged parents to
take responsibility for protecting their children from dengue fever
after the deaths of 2 children from the disease so far this year
[2011].

Cheamon Thavy, director of dengue fever health education at the
National Centre for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control at
the Ministry of Health, said that some people do not follow health
officials' advice.

"[It is] hard to find a strategy to make them cooperate with us and
due to this, a 5 year old boy from Kandal province and 10 year old
from Takeo province died from dengue fever this year [2011]," said
Cheamon Thavy.

Ngan Chantha, director of the National Anti-Dengue programme at the
Ministry of Health, said that parents must protect their children from
the disease.

"[Parents] must ... monitor the environment around their home like
rubbish, old tyres, coconut shells, cans, or larvae and if there are
those things around their home, they should spend time to clean it,"
said Ngan Chantha.

According to the National Anti-Dengue programme, Phnom Penh, Kandal,
Siem Reap, Kampot, Kampong Cham, and Banteay Meanchey provinces are
the most heavily affected by dengue fever.

Ou Sopha, program director for combating dengue fever at the Kandal
provincial health department, said that the national authority would
distribute the insecticide abate [larvicide] within the 6 most
infectious provinces.

According to the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and
Malaria Control there have been 231 cases of dengue fever in the 1st 3
months of this year [2011] resulting in 2 deaths, compared with 193
cases resulting in one death over the same period last year [2010].

[According to the newswire above, officials stated that the number of
cases of dengue fever in Cambodia in the 1st 3 months of 2011 was 231
cases and 2 deaths, compared with 193 cases and one death over the
same period in 2010.

According to the number of reported cases of dengue fever and dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF) in the Western Pacific region, by country,
from WHO's Regional Office for the Western Pacific (WHO/WPRO), dated
11 Oct 2010 (available at
http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/data/dengue/), there were 9996
cases and 29 deaths of dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) in Cambodia in the 1st 9 months of 2010, with a CFR (case
fatality rate) of 0.29.

In Cambodia, the worst dengue epidemic on record was in 1998, when a
total 16 216 DHF cases and 475 deaths were reported with a case
fatality rate of 2.9 per cent among all cases. The epidemic mainly
affected Phnom Penh and neighboring Kandal province. In recent years,
between 10 000 and 12 000 cases have been reported annually,
indicating that the disease has reached a hyperendemic situation. The
primary vector of dengue in Cambodia is _Aedes aegypti_ , while _Ae.
albopictus_ is a secondary vector. Transmission of dengue peaks
between June and September (see
http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/epidemiology/dengue/cam_profile.htm.)

The total number of dengue fever cases in 2010 was 12 347 cases and
37 deaths; 11 699 cases and 38 deaths in 2009; 9245 cases and 65
deaths in 2008; and 39 851 cases and 407 deaths in 2007.
