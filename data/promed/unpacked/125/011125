Abstract
--------
Wild animals have been implicated as the origin of SARS-CoV-2, but it is largely unknown how the virus affects most wildlife species and if wildlife could ultimately serve as a reservoir for maintaining the virus outside the human population. Here we show that several common peridomestic species, including deer mice, bushy-tailed woodrats, and striped skunks, are susceptible to infection and can shed the virus in respiratory secretions. In contrast, we demonstrate that cottontail rabbits, fox squirrels, Wyoming ground squirrels, black-tailed prairie dogs, house mice, and raccoons are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our work expands upon the existing knowledge base of susceptible species and provides evidence that human-wildlife interactions could result in continued transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This survey above adds to the experimental studies that tested susceptibility of mammals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this case, the researchers tested North American animals that are often exposed to humans. Prior proteomic work and experimental studies showed that carnivores (Order Carnivora) and rodents (Order Rodentia) are high risk groups. They found 2 rodents of the Subfamily Neotominae (deer mouse and bushy-tailed woodrat) and one mustelid (striped skunk) to be susceptible to experimental inoculation of high doses of SARS-CoV-2 and can shed infectious virus. Other rodents tested (2 squirrels and the house mouse), a carnivore (the raccoon, a procyonid), and a wild lagomorph (cottontail rabbit) were not susceptible to this experimental infection. - Mod.PMB]
