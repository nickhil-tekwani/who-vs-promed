Woody's Pet Food Deli is recalling 3 date codes of raw turkey pet food found by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to be contaminated with _Salmonella_. The agriculture department initiated testing after the Minnesota Department of Health identified a human case of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Reading linked to the pet food.

Public health officials discovered during their investigation that Woody's Pet Deli raw turkey pet food was fed regularly to a pet in the household of the infected individual. The pet tested positive for a different strain of _Salmonella_.

Woody's is a small Minnesota-based chain of pet food shops, with locations in Minneapolis, St Paul, and Woodbury. The recalled product was sold in 5-pound plastic containers, identified as "Woody's Pet Food Deli Raw Free Range Turkey," and bearing one of the following Use By dates: 01/10/20, 01/12/20, 01/15/20.

The CDC is investigating an ongoing multi-state outbreak of _Salmonella_ Reading infections linked to raw turkey products from multiple sources. The outbreak has been in progress since November 2017. As of 18 Dec 2018, there had been 216 cases of _S._ Reading illnesses reported in 38 states. 1 person has died and 84 have been hospitalized.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has been tracking 33 _Salmonella_ illnesses in 6 provinces. Those patients are linked to raw turkey and raw chicken products. The same outbreak strain of _S._ Reading has been recovered from both Canadian and USA patients. No single source or supplier in either the USA or Canada of raw turkey products or of live turkeys has been identified that could account for the whole outbreak.

In November 2018 and again in December 2018, Jennie-O-Turkey Store Sales in Wisconsin and Minnesota respectively recalled nearly 128 tons of raw ground turkey products that were associated with the _Salmonella_ Reading outbreak.

This is the 2nd pet food recall linked to the _Salmonella_ Reading outbreak. In February 2018, Raws for Paws recalled about 4000 pounds of ground turkey pet food after 2 children were infected with _S._ Reading. The outbreak strain was recovered from samples of the Raws for Paws food fed to pets in the household where the children lived. 1 of the 2 children was hospitalized with osteomyelitis.

[Adequate cooking and adherence to strict kitchen hygiene will greatly diminish any risk of illness. Regarding food for pets, there is no real advantage to using raw meats which as here pose a risk of infection to the animal and its owners. - Mod.LL
