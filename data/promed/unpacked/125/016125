One new property has tested positive for the cattle disease _Mycoplasma bovis_. The property is owned by the Van Leeuwen Dairy Group, which has 16 farms in the South Canterbury and North Otago region.

The latest case brings the total to 7 infected properties in the outbreak to date. A total of 5 of the farms with infected cases are owned by the Van Leeuwen Dairy Group, 1 is in North Otago, and the 7th a lifestyle block in North Canterbury.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) said the latest infected farm was already under a restricted notice. "We've said all along that we fully expected the possibility for further farms within this enterprise testing positive," response incident controller Stephen Bell said.

"The nature of this disease is that it spreads between animals that are in close, repeated and prolonged contact."

The latest detection showed the ministry's protocol of testing herds up to 3 times was working, he said. "It has meant there has been a long period of disruption and uncertainty for farms that are being tested but we have to be absolutely thorough in diagnosing positive and negative farms."

Over 26 000 of a planned 39 000 tests have now been completed by the ministry's laboratory in Upper Hutt. "As our picture grows and as more and more test results come back, the greater our confidence that the disease is being well contained on the known infected properties," Mr. Bell said.

If samples beyond the infected properties continued to test negative for the disease, the ministry would consider assessing whether the disease could be eradicated.

[This particular pathogen causes a variety of clinical signs from respiratory, to arthritis, and mastitis, and can be difficult to diagnose. It can be an aggressive pathogen, therefore it is not unexpected that MPI has found, and expects to find more cases of this disease. Hopefully this agent will not spread any farther and in a best case scenario, this will be the last infected premises. - Mod.TG
