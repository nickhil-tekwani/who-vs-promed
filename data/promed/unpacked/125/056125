New South Wales and Queensland will work together to investigate and
respond to the Hendra virus outbreak. There have been 5 outbreaks in
the past 3 weeks in both states: 3 in south east Queensland and 2 in
New South Wales. 7 horses have died and another 40 are under
quarantine. 32 people who were exposed to the infected animals are
being tested and monitored for signs of the virus.

The taskforce will include chief veterinarians, health officers and
scientists as well as a CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation] representative.

Queensland's Agriculture Minister Tim Mulherin says the taskforce
will meet in Brisbane on Wednesday [13 Jul 2011]. "The taskforce will
work on 3 fronts: We'll be analysing the situation in both states to
better understand the outbreak; identifying areas of further
collaboration, and undertaking longer-term planning for managing the
disease and it's impact," he said. "By bringing these experts and
leaders together we will work more closely to reduce the incidences
and the impacts of Hendra cases."

New South Wales chief veterinary officer Ian Roth says they will
discuss a coordinated approach in responding to the disease. "We'll be
looking at sort of viral issues, horse issues, how we protect human
health issues, flying fox issues, all the things that are relevant to
this particular problem," he said.

Four people have died from Hendra virus since it was discovered in
the Brisbane suburb of Hendra in 1994.

New South Wales [NSW] and Queensland have stepped up cooperation to
contain the biggest outbreak of Hendra disease on record as properties
on both side of the border remain locked down. The premiers of each
state, having discussed the emergency, agreed yesterday [10 Jul 2011]
to set up a joint taskforce to deliver what Anna Bligh [Premier of
Queensland] called a "consistent and coordinated" approach.

Two horses are dead in NSW in the 1st eruptions of the disease there
for 5 years, and 5 more have died in Queensland over the past
fortnight after 3 separate outbreaks in that state.

Ominously, the incident in NSW at Macksville, south of Coffs Harbour,
is the farthest south Hendra has been detected. A 16-year-old mare
died there last Sunday [3 Jul 2011], and 6 people are being monitored
in case of a crossover infection.

In Queensland, 17 people are yet to receive the all-clear after being
exposed to the bat-borne virus in outbreaks at Beaudesert, Mount
Alford, and Park Ridge, all southwest of Brisbane.

Scientists have speculated that last summer's [2010-11] disastrous
floods in Queensland and in northern NSW might have reduced the food
supply of fruit bats, increasing stress levels that cause them to
express the lethal virus. All 4 species of Australian flying fox carry
Hendra, but researchers say they cannot fully explain how it is passed
to horses and, in some cases, on to people.

The best explanation is that horses are infected by the contamination
of feed or pasture from bat droppings and bodily secretions.

People who come into close contact with diseased horses -- typically
their handlers and vets -- are then put at risk.

The Queensland Premier said closer cooperation between the states was
important to understanding this latest outbreak.

Ms Bligh said more than 40 horses were under quarantine in
Queensland, on 9 properties, and were being checked daily for signs of
disease. In all, 32 people in both states were being monitored. But
none was considered to be sufficiently exposed to warrant treatment
with an experimental anti-serum that can stop progression of the
disease.

[The location of the 5 outbreaks can be seen on the map at

[The task force is important to explore ways to control the disease
so I hope some researchers are included who may have some insights but
as yet unpublished work.

Perhaps fencing off the fig trees so that horses are no longer
exposed to so much saliva, and perhaps excrement from the flying foxes
would be appropriate? The bats seem to be very sloppy when they eat
and figs seem to be a favorite food. There are fig trees on several of
the properties in quarantine.

So while there may be no clear cut answers there may be some simple
management techniques that may prove helpful. Certainly if the horses
are not under the trees they have less exposure to the bats and
therefore it should stand to reason less exposure to the virus. -
