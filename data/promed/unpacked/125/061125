White House Warns on Anthrax Tests
------------------------
WASHINGTON -The White House is warning that anthrax field tests widely used
since last fall's attacks give fast but often incorrect results, prompting
authorities to shut down buildings prematurely and hand out unneeded
antibiotics.
In a memo being sent Monday to more than 250 federal agencies and to
firefighters, police, and local officials across the country, authorities
say none of the commercially available field tests are reliable. They
advise federal agencies to stop buying them and to cancel any pending
contracts.
"This equipment does not pass acceptable standards for effectiveness," said
the memo from John H. Marburger III, director of the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy. "Field testing ... is not recommended and
should not be used."
The advisory comes after an extensive study of the tests by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). The study, the first of its kind, found that all tests
on the market are prone to miss small amounts of anthrax and to detect
anthrax when there was none there.
The memo advises authorities to send results to a lab, where they can get
initial readings within 6 hours. A 17-page set of guidelines offers
detailed suggestions for how to handle suspicious mail.
The guidelines also recommend federal agencies stop routinely testing their
mailrooms for anthrax, given that most mail is being irradiated, low levels
of anthrax do not pose a significant risk and the tests used are not reliable.
The field tests, which cost about $35 each, are designed to determine
quickly whether a suspicious white powder could be anthrax, and hundreds of
thousands of them were sold during and after last fall's attacks-by-mail.
But false results cause real problems, officials say.
In May 2002, for instance, field tests indicated anthrax in the mailrooms
of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The World Bank shut
down the ventilation system in the entire building and sent 1200 workers
home because it was too hot to work inside. The IMF gave about 100 people
antibiotics, though many held off taking them. In the end, anthrax was not
confirmed at either location.
"Bad information is worse than no information," said Dr. Michael Osterholm,
a bioterrorism expert at the University of Minnesota who has been serving
as an adviser to HHS.
Still, at the World Bank, there are no regrets. "The bank will always err
on the side of caution," said spokesman Damian Milverton. Milverson said
forcing staff to work from home is "nothing" compared to the risk of
ignoring what could actually be anthrax. But he added officials will
consider the guidelines.
Field tests are easy to use. A sample of suspicious powder is dissolved
into a special fluid and run through a gadget to check for genetic markers
from the Bacillus family, which includes anthrax. But they also pick up
other bacteria in the Bacillus family that is not anthrax. And they won't
register anthrax if there are fewer than 100 000 spores, more than enough
to kill someone.
The manufacturer of the most popular field test, Smart Ticket, responded it
is designed for use only if a visible powder is present. It's not designed
to pick up anthrax floating invisibly through the air, said Cheryl Trudil,
marketing manage of New Horizons of Columbia, Maryland. "If you have white
powder on your desk and you're scared to death it's anthrax, someone can
come and in 15 minutes tell you it's not anthrax," she said.
But administration officials say that even with a powder, the test could
miss a small amount of anthrax if it were mixed with other material.
Trudil allows the test produces some "false positives," but said it's no
big deal because the truth will come out when further testing is done in
the lab. Without the field test, local officials would have to assume all
suspicious powders are anthrax and send them to the lab, which would cause
severe backups, she said.
Administration officials said the FBI looked at lab capacity and determined
it was sufficient to handle the demand.
