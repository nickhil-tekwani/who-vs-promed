The end is only the beginning
-----------------------------
With the deadly foot-and mouth [FMD] epidemic finally declared over 4
months after it started racing through the prefecture's livestock,
local farmers have begun setting their sights on a comeback.

However, there are many serious concerns about how the outbreak has
affected other local industries, including commerce and travel.
Farmers, meanwhile, say the recovery has barely begun.

"It's as if we've just gotten over the 1st mountain...I'm at a loss
for words," Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru told reporters at a Friday [27
Aug 2010] press conference at prefectural government headquarters.
Head low, he read aloud the proclamation declaring an end to the
deadly epidemic.

However, the news was not all good. "[The epidemic] has seriously
affected our economy and recovery will be no easy feat,"
Higashikokubaru continued, emphasizing the many problems still faced
by the prefecture.

Some local farmers who are hoping to begin raising animals again also
have expressed their concern.

The central government this month [August 2010] will finish issuing
subsidies to farming households affected by the cull. While the
government will provide assistance to help them get their businesses
up and running again, it is not clear whether this "income" is
subject to taxes. If so, income tax will take away a considerable amount.

"It'll make things harder for us if it gets taxed," said a farmer who
had to slaughter 74 calves even after inoculation.

Rumors, too, continue to inflict damage. According to the Miyazaki
Trucking Association, the 38 shipping companies operating in the
prefecture "have been turned away when trying to make deliveries in
some places outside the prefecture. They've also been told to not
make deliveries in trucks with Miyazaki plates."

A recent Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry canvas of
retailers nationwide discovered 16 instances of inappropriate signage
declaring, "We do not carry Miyazaki beef or pork."

"The real fight is just beginning," says a Takanabecho pig farmer who
lost 3000 animals during the epidemic. Last month [July 2010], [he]
and another farmer formed the "new pork project" committee, which
plans to take action to prevent future outbreaks in the area." We're
hoping for a quick recovery, but at the same time we also plan to
look 30 years down the road," [he] said.

With the epidemic officially declared over, Tachikawa Takashimaya
department store in Tachikawa, Tokyo, began a promotion of Miyazaki
beef, with discounts of 20 percent to 30 percent. The store said that
in June and July [2010], it received 212 messages of support for the
affected farmers of Miyazaki Prefecture.

Miyazaki declares end to livestock epidemic
-------------------------------------------
Miyazaki Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru declared Friday [27 Aug 2010] an
end to the FMD epidemic that has severely hit livestock in the
southwestern Japanese prefecture, more than 4 months after the 1st
case was reported. "We have completed steps to eradicate the virus,"
Higashikokubaru told a news conference at the prefectural government
building. "I declare an end to the FMD in the prefecture."

The outbreak in the prefecture that began in late April 2010 [see
item 3 and commentary re real time of outbreak's start.- Mod.AS]
forced the prefecture to slaughter some 289 000 pigs and cows, and
impose a ban on transfers of livestock.

The latest announcement comes after the Miyazaki government lifted
its last ban on the transfers of animals in late July [2010] and made
an announcement Thursday [26 Aug 2010] that all 1250 affected farms
had completed procedures to detoxify and dispose of animal excreta to
ensure the complete eradication of the virus.

The disease also led to temporary closures of public facilities and
cancellations of nearly 300 sports and other public events, while the
prefectural government asked residents in the affected areas and
their vicinities to refrain from going out unless absolutely necessary.

The 1st confirmed case of FMD in the recent outbreak was reported in
the town of Tsuno on 20 Apr 2010 [see remark above] before it spread
to 11 municipalities, including Miyakonojo City, one of Japan's
biggest livestock centers.

The governor declared a state of emergency on 18 May 2010 which was
partially lifted on 1 July 2010 after all animals in affected areas
were culled.

Infectious route of foot-and-mouth disease unidentified
-------------------------------------------------------
An expert panel under the farm ministry could not detect the
infectious route of the FMD that hit Miyazaki Prefecture this year
[2010], its interim report showed Tuesday [24 Aug 2010].

"It would be quite difficult" to identify the cause of the disease's
outbreak, the head of the team, Tomoyuki Tsuda, told a press
conference. "We are just guessing here but (the virus) might have
traveled with people."

Foot-and-mouth disease spread in Hokkaido and Miyazaki prefectures in
2000 and it was later surmised that straw from China, which was used
in the barns for the animals, was responsible.

But the interim report [addressing the 2010 outbreak] noted the panel
has not identified any specific routes of the virus entry from abroad
[see commentary below].

[According to earlier reports on the findings of the epidemiological
research team led by Tomoyuki Tsuda, the 1st FMD infection took place
at a water buffalo farm in Tsunocho in the Miyazaki prefecture as
early as mid-March 2010. This case was not diagnosed at that time; at
least 10 additional farms had been infected with FMD before the
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry detected (and reported)
the 1st case on 20 Apr 2010.

The research team also found that FMD possibly spread while livestock
farmers were unaware of the symptoms of the disease, and that
employees of several farms in Tsunocho and Kawaminamicho in the
prefecture, where animals were infected with the disease, had visited
each other, while a feedstuff delivery service stopped by many farms
in different municipalities in the area. Kawaminamicho neighbors
Tsunocho, where the 1st infection case was detected. The
epidemiological research team was said to believe effective initial
response measures against the disease were stymied as a result of the
delayed detection of the real 1st case (see ProMED-mail archives
20100726.2498 and 20100629.2160).

A somewhat similar scenario was seen during the 1st phases of the
major FMD outbreak in the UK, 2001, when the virus spread several
weeks before being noticed and diagnosed. Similarly, the "smoking
gun" was never detected. Luckily for Japan, their current outbreak
remained restricted to Miyazaki, while in the UK it spread widely by
uncontrolled movements of subclinically/mildly infected sheep.

For the sake of lessons to be learned, it will be helpful to obtain
the full report of the Japanese investigation Team. - Mod.AS]
