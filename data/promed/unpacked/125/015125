Outbreaks of _Salmonella_ infections linked to backyard poultry
--------------------------------------------------------
CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating multistate outbreaks of _Salmonella_ Braenderup and _Salmonella_ Montevideo infections linked to contact with backyard poultry.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS performed on _Salmonella_ from ill people in this outbreak showed that they are closely related genetically. This means that the ill people are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 10 May 2019, a total of 52 people infected with the outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have been reported from 21 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is on the map of reported cases page.

Total / 52

Illnesses started on dates from 12 Jan 2019 to 29 Apr 2019. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 60 years, with a median age of 21 years. 56% are female. Of 27 people with information available, 5 (19%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

WGS analysis of 4 isolates from ill people predicted antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, or tetracycline. An additional 5 isolates from ill people did not show evidence of antimicrobial resistance. Testing of outbreak isolates using standard antimicrobial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway. This resistance may affect the choice of antimicrobial used to treat some people.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about animal contact in the week before they became ill. Of 33 people interviewed, 23 (70%) reported contact with backyard poultry before becoming ill. Ill people reported buying poultry from various sources, including agricultural stores, websites, and hatcheries.

Backyard poultry from multiple hatcheries are the likely source of these outbreaks. Regardless of where poultry are purchased, these birds can carry _Salmonella_ that can make people sick. Backyard poultry owners should always follow steps to stay healthy around their birds.

This investigation is ongoing, and CDC will provide updates when more information becomes available.
