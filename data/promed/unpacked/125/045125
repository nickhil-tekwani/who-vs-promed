As the National Polio Programme is set to launch this year's [2019] last countrywide vaccination drive on Monday (today [16 Dec 2019]), 3 more infants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab were found to be suffering from polio. With the latest confirmation of the crippling virus in the 3 children, aged between 4 and 8 months, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan has surged to 104 during the current year [2019]. The tally was as low as 12 last year [2018] and 8 in 2017.

According to an official statement, Pakistan resumes its aggressive battle against the crippling poliovirus with the nationwide door-to-door campaign in all districts/areas of the country from [16-20 Dec 2019] during which 39.6 million children will be targeted. The campaign has been synchronised with Afghanistan to ensure vaccination of all children on the move as well, as 75 of the 104 cases belong to KP that shares a long border with the landlocked country.

While it will be a 5-day campaign plus 2-day catch-up in core reservoirs, a 3-day drive with 2-day catch-up will be run elsewhere across Pakistan.

Just a day before the launch of the vaccination drive, the National Institute of Health confirmed that 3 children, including 2 girls, hailing from KP and Punjab have [become] paralysed due to the crippling poliovirus. According to a lab official, 2 cases were reported from district Lakki Marwat of KP and 1 from district Muzaffargarh of Punjab.

"A 4-month-old girl, who has been paralysed by the virus, is a resident of Bakhmal Ahmadzai union council of Lakki Marwat's Tehsil Serai Naurang. The other 8-month-old victim is a boy belonging to Daratang UC of Lakki Marwat. The official said the Daratang boy was a "case of refusal, as the family was not willing to administer polio vaccine to him".

"The 3rd case is from Punjab where a 7-month-old girl of Tehsil Kot Addu of District Muzaffargarh has [become] paralysed due to polio virus. She, too, had not received a single dose of polio vaccine," he said.

The area-wise polio data of the current year [2019] shows that 75 cases have been reported from KP, 16 from Sindh, 7 from Balochistan and 6 cases from Punjab. While talking to Dawn, National Coordinator for Emergency Operation Centre Dr. Rana Safdar said Pakistan faced irreparable loss as over 100 children [were] paralysed in 2019. "We have to reverse this onslaught by polio virus to prevent further damage. We plan to conduct 3 large-scale campaigns in December [2019], February [2020] and April [2020] to push the virus back," he said.

"The high-quality December [2019] campaign is imperative to set the right momentum. The National Polio Programme has worked extremely hard to ensure availability of the world's highest quality vaccine at people's doorstep. It's now [the] duty of the parents and all Pakistanis to facilitate vaccination of every child across the country," Dr. Safdar said.

The provincial coordinator for EOC Balochistan, Rashid Razzaq, said 33 districts including Quetta, Pishin Naseerabad, Jaffarabad, Jhal Magsi, Subhatpur, Dera Bugti, Sibi, Loralai, Duki, Harnai, Ziarat, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Barkhan, Zhob, Sherani, Bolan, Kohlu, Nushki, Chagai, Washuk, Kharan, Kalat, Mastung and Khuzdar will be covered during the drive.

The official said: "We have adopted strict security measures to provide complete security to polio workers and prevent any unforeseen situation. Levies force, police and Frontier Corps will be deployed to protect polio workers." He added that religious scholars were also taking part in the drive to persuade the parents who refused to allow polio workers to administer vaccine to their children.

In all, 39.6 million children will be targeted during the weeklong campaign against the disease. They will include around 19.9 million children in Punjab, 9 million in Sindh, 6.75 million in KP, 2.5 million in Balochistan, 690 000 in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, 240 000 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 356 000 children in Islamabad.

Along with [the] oral polio vaccine (OPV), Vitamin A supplement will also be administered to around 36 million children aged between 6 and 59 months, aimed at boosting immunity against all infectious diseases.

Around 265 000 personnel including 26 384 officials in charge of areas, 8434 UC medical officers, 201 799 mobile, 10 243 fixed and 11 714 transit members of polio vaccination teams will strive to achieve the targets set for the campaign. The EOC has also deployed 45 experts to facilitate preparedness and ground implementation of campaign activities by local teams in priority areas.

On the direction of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the government has also taken renowned religious figures on board. A message of Maulana Tariq Jameel in favour of the campaign is being widely spread. The Maulana said: "There is a misconception that the polio vaccine is a conspiracy. It is a medicine and Allah has kept cure in it. Administer polio drops to your children."

There are only 2 countries in the world -- Pakistan and Afghanistan -- where polio cases are being reported. Pakistan remains under a polio-linked travel restriction imposed on the recommendation of the World Health Organisation due to which every person travelling abroad has to carry a polio vaccination certificate.

Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of 5. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease.

Another polio case has been reported in Punjab on Sunday [15 Dec 2019], taking the tally of such cases across the country to 104 this year [2019], ARY News reported.

According to the Health Ministry, the polio case was reported from the Muzaffargarh city of Punjab province. The authorities said that a 7-month-old baby boy in Muzaffargarh was diagnosed with the crippling disease, adding that the minor was not vaccinated against the virus.

The polio Eradication Initiative confirmed 3 more cases of wild polio virus 1 (WPV1) in the country, including 2 from Mirpurkhas and 1 from the Swabi in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, announcing that the number of polio cases has now crossed 101 with 73 polio cases in KP followed by 16 in the Sindh province. The new additions in the number of rising victims of the crippling disease, which turns lethal in some cases too, [have] questioned the efficacy of the countrywide vaccination campaign.

The Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for Polio in Sindh on Saturday [14 Dec 2019] announced 2 new polio cases from the district Mirpurkhas where 2 children of 3 and 6 years of age were crippled by the polio virus. One of the victim is a 3-year-old [male] from village Islamuddin, UC Mir Khuda Bux, Taluka Digri, Mirpurkhas, who contracted polio on [17 Nov 2019]. An official of the EOC Sindh quoted the parents as saying the child had received 7 doses of polio vaccine during the campaigns, while the health officials could only confirm 2 immunization doses from the vaccination card. Interestingly, the doctors were confident that "the child would not suffer from disability as his legs and spine were not affected but has slight weakness in the facial muscles."

The 2nd case involved 6-year-old [male], who hails from Siyal Colony, UC 5, Mirpurkhas, and he contracted the polio virus on [20 Nov 2019]. Here also the Polio Eradication officials quoted the parents as telling that the child had received 7 doses of the vaccine in addition to 3 more during the routine immunization, but even then the child contracted the life crippling disease. He however said investigations are underway as to how many doses were actually given. "Both the legs of the child were initially affected by the virus," but the officials hoped he will not suffer from any permanent disability. An official of the Emergency Operation Centre for Polio said Sindh has 16 new polio cases in 2019 of which 6 are from Karachi, 2 from Hyderabad, 2 from Larkana, 2 from Jamshoro, 2 from Mirpurkhas, and 1 each from Shahed Benazirabad and Sajawal.

The Emergency Operation Centre for Polio in Sindh strongly encourages parents to vaccinate their children in the upcoming polio campaign, as it has become clear that if the oral polio vaccine is not administered, the virus will thrive and paralyze children. "New campaigns are starting from [16 Dec 2019] which will continue until June [2020] so we can reverse this trend," a spokesman for EOC Sindh announced.

There was a similar sad news from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where a 6-month-old child in Tehsil Topi, UC Batakara of District Swabi contracted the polio virus. The infection proved fatal, and the child died due to paralysis of his limbs and the muscles that help in breathing, the officials said. With the latest polio case from the KP, the number of confirmed polio cases in the KP rose to 73 and 101 in entire Pakistan, officials said.

[It appears as though over this weekend, there have been 6 newly confirmed cases of WPV1-associated disease reported in Pakistan. In section [1] above, the most recent reports were today (15/16 Dec 2019) with 3 newly confirmed cases: 2 from Laki Marwat District Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and 1 from Muzaffargarh District, Punjab. In section [2] above, there is mention of a case in Muzaffargarh District, Punjab, same age, but different gender -- presumably the same case but reporting error. In section [3] above, there is mention of 3 newly confirmed cases: 2 from Mirpurkhas District in Sindh and 1 from Swabi District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

There are multiple reports of campaigns that have been held and more to be held, but the virus keeps circulating and infecting susceptible children, many of whom have reportedly received multiple doses of the vaccine, albeit without documentation of these doses as mentioned by the interviewees.

When one investigates "vaccine failure" one questions whether there was failure to get the vaccine, or did the vaccine fail to produce immunity? Very hard to tease out the answer here. Presumably many of the "failure to produce immunity" challenges were the same in neighboring countries where transmission was ultimately interrupted. So why not Pakistan and Afghanistan?

Returning to the impact, the count of WPV (presumed to be WPV rather than cVDPV) associated paralytic cases with date of onset in 2019 is now up to 104 in Pakistan, and 128 globally (adding the 24 cases reported from Afghanistan).
