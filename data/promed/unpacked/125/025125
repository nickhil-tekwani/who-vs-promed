More than a dozen people fell ill in Sweden recently with _Salmonella_ infections after eating undercooked burgers. An outbreak with 15 cases of salmonellosis after a lunch at a hotel restaurant was investigated by the local food safety authority and the regional public health agency in Jämtland Härjedalen. The _Salmonella_ Enteritidis outbreak occurred among students and teachers from the Fjällgymnasiet high school during a ski competition in northern Sweden.

Based on information from 11 patients, the 1st date of illness onset was 28 Jan 2022 and the last was 4 Feb 2022. The age range was 17 to 57 years old with a median age of 19. 10 of those sick were male and 1 was female, all of them were from northern Sweden. All sick people had a common meal where ground (minced) meat burgers were consumed. Some of those who ate the lunch reported that the burgers were clearly undercooked.

After finding _Salmonella_ in samples of ground meat, further tracing of the implicated batch of frozen beef and pork meat was performed by local authorities, which revealed it came from Poland. _Salmonella_ was found in 3 of 6 meat samples but there is no ongoing risk of people getting sick as the implicated batch was only distributed to restaurants and has now been withdrawn.
