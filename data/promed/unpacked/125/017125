Epidemiological studies on grapevine bois noir in France
----------------------------------------------------
Epidemiological studies have been carried out in the Rhone valley in France
on grapevine bois noir phytoplasma for 3 years. This grapevine yellows is
caused by a stolbur type phytoplasma. Wild plants and insects present in
vineyards or in their vicinity were tested by PCR, and transmission trials
were also carried out in the laboratory. Many insects species (Hemiptera)
were captured and tested. Results showed that bois noir phytoplasma could be
detected in _Hyalesthes obsoletus_ (Hemiptera: Cixiidae), and to a much
lesser extent in _Mocydia crocea_ and _Euscelis lineolatus_.
The phytoplasma was not detected in the genus Aphrodes, Neoaliturus and
Psammotettix, although this had been the case in other studies. However,
successful transmission of the phytoplasma to grapevine, periwinkle
(_Catharanthus
roseus_) and thorn-apple (_Datura stramonium_) could only be obtained with
_Hyalesthes obsoletus_.
In addition, 34 wild plant species were monitored for the presence of the
phytoplasma. It was detected in _Cardaria draba_, _Convolvulus arvensis_,
_Prunus avium_, _P. domestica_, _Syringa vulgaris_, _Ficus carica_ and
_Ulmus_. Grapevine is a poor host of _H. obsoletus_ which feeds on it only
occasionally. It has also been confirmed that _Convolvulus arvensis_ and
_Cardaria draba_ are hosts plants of the insect vector of grapevine bois
noir phytoplasma.

confirmation. Together with knowledge of wild hosts of the pathogen, this
