Germany's Federal Ministry for Food and Agriculture has summoned its state-level counterparts for crisis talks following revelations _Listeria_-tainted meat products have killed 3 people and made another 37 sick.

The ministry confirmed to just-food the talks will be held next Friday (25 Oct [2019]), aiming to improve identification of weak health control points, boosting cooperation between state health regulators and federal officials, including more exchanges of information. "The federal government must know where the weak points are on the local level," said food and agricultural minister Julia Klockner. "The states must be willing to discuss stronger pooling of competencies in order to optimize food inspections."

The meat products in question were made by Twistetal, Hesse-based Wilke Waldecker Fleisch- und Wurstwaren.

Under Germany's federal system, food inspections are the responsibly of the state-level governments, with the state of Hesse being harshly criticized for acting sluggishly after receiving a warning from the Robert Koch Institute, which on 12 Aug [2019] flagged suspicions of _Listeria_ in Wilke products.

Production was not stopped by the authorities until 2 Oct [2019]. Last week, the administrative court of Kassel rejected Wilke's plea to restore production, citing a report by the hygiene inspector: "The room was filled with completely rotten products, mould, rot, reek ... on the floor was a reeking fluid."

Several Romanian workers employed by Wilke have since echoed these remarks in interviews to local press. The EU's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) identified 25 countries to which Wilke products were exported, including most member states, as well as Switzerland, the US, Russia, and Japan.

German media reports have also suggested Klockner will urge state-level governments next week to increase expenditure in food safety inspections, including through the addition of personnel.

just-food contacted Wilke Waldecker Fleisch- und Wurstwaren for comment but had received no response at the time of writing.

The United States is one of more than 20 countries that may have received meat from a German company linked to a _Listeria_ outbreak.

Potentially contaminated products from Wilke Waldecker Fleisch- und Wurstwaren were distributed to the US, according to the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).

Food Safety News has contacted the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the US Department of Agriculture for information. A spokesman said the agency was not aware of any potential recalls related to sausages imported from Germany, and Wilke is not certified as eligible to export to the US.

Other affected nations include Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

Products made by Wilke have been recalled. German authorities are updating a document with affected products that is now 13 pages long. They can be recognized by the oval identification mark "DE EV 203 EG," which identifies the manufacturer regardless of the brand. Items could have been sold loose and to hospital kitchens and canteens.

Officials in the Waldeck-Frankenberg district of Germany stopped production at the facility in Twistetal, Berndorf in early October [2019]. The company has since filed for bankruptcy.

According to the German branch of consumer organization Foodwatch, there was suspicion of _Listeria_ in mid-August [2019] and hygiene deficiencies at the factory found at the end of August [2019], but a follow-up inspection in September [2019] revealed these issues were mostly corrected. The group accused authorities of being too slow in crisis management and not sharing sufficient information.

Atria, a retailer in Sweden, recalled all the dates of 6 products from the Wilke range. None of the salami products have tested positive for _Listeria_. Deli Drengene ApS in Denmark recalled snack sausages, as _Listeria_ was found at the production company in Germany.

In Luxembourg, some of the products were marketed in catering establishments. Authorities contacted the institutions concerned to check compliance with withdrawal measures, and initial results show recalls have been made. Official samples are being taken to do lab tests on these items. Based on current information, the direct distribution of products to the consumer did not take place.

The outbreak involves a _Listeria monocytogenes_ sequence cluster type 2521 (serogroup IIa). It was identified last year [2018] by whole-genome sequencing, and 37 people are involved from 12 German states. So far, no related illnesses have been reported from other European countries.

In 2014, 2016, and 2017, a few sporadic cases were found, which have been retrospectively assigned as belonging to the outbreak. One infection was recorded in 2014, 3 in 2016, and 4 in 2017.

Genome sequences of the _Listeria_ isolates are closely related, so it can be assumed that patients have become infected by a common source, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).

In mid-2018, there was an increase with 21 cases detected by genome sequencing at RKI. This year, 8 more infections were found with the last known disease onset date being 13 Jul 2019. Most people were infected by eating food in healthcare facilities.

The age range of affected people is between 31 and 91 years. There are 18 women and 19 men but no pregnancy-related cases. Three people are reported to have died with listeriosis as a contributing factor. Ten other people infected with _Listeria_ died but not as a consequence of listeriosis, and for one patient the cause of death could not be determined.

The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and the Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL) looked at supply chains and food samples. Investigations compared a _Listeria_ isolate from a food of the company near Hesse with patient isolates of the outbreak, finding a close relationship between them.

In 2018, 701 reports of invasive listeriosis in Germany were submitted to the RKI.

Elderly and immunocompromised people, expectant mothers, and newborn babies have an increased risk of contracting listeriosis. Symptoms of the infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. The time between becoming infected and developing symptoms varies from a few to 70 days with an average of 3 weeks.

[The news reports above describe a listeriosis outbreak that has affected 40 people, 3 of whom have died, in 12 German states between 2014 and 2019, due to _Listeria_-contaminated meat products manufactured at a processing facility in the German state of Hesse and widely distributed to more than 20 European countries, Switzerland, Russia, Lebanon, Japan, and possibly the US. The meat products were said to have been recalled, and the last known case has a disease onset date of 13 Jul 2019, more than 70 days ago. Listeriosis has an incubation period of up to 70 days, so the outbreak is possibly over, if the recall of contaminated meat products was complete. However, the Hesse production facility was not closed until the beginning of October 2019.

Genotyping the clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_ by whole-genome sequencing identified the cluster of cases as having a common source. _Listeria_ was reported to have been found at the Hesse production facility, and a "close relationship" was found between the_Listeria_ isolated from a food of the Hesse company and the clinical outbreak strain.

We are told that most people infected in this outbreak ate the contaminated meat products at healthcare facilities. Such people are at increased risk of disseminated listeriosis if they eat _Listeria_-contaminated food that is not adequately cooked before eating. We are not told specifically if the contaminated food was ready-to-eat cold cuts. Refrigerated cold cut meats that are not cooked before eating are well-recognized sources for listeriosis and should not be served to at-risk people. Even if initial contamination adds only a few _Listeria_ organisms to the food, the contamination can be significant for refrigerated foods because _L. monocytogenes_ can subsequently multiply at refrigerator temperatures to a sufficient number to cause disease. - Mod.ML
