CIGUATERA FISH POISONING LINKED TO THE INGESTION OF BARRACUDA IN A MONTREAL
RESTAURANT
Ciguatera fish poisoning in humans is most commonly caused by eating
carnivorous fish contaminated by a toxin produced by the dinoflagellate
Gambierdiscus toxicus. The toxin bio-accumulates through the food chain,
and carnivorous fish such as barracuda, red snapper, grouper, sturgeon, and
amberjack are usually the most commonly involved.
Most cases of ciguatera poisoning reported in the past have involved
Canadians who ate fish in the Caribbean while on holiday. These cases have
implicated grouper in the Dominican Republic, kingfish in Jamaica, and
barracuda in Haiti. A fish casserole caused the illness in 57 people
during a trip to Cuba. Ciguatera poisonings have also been reported in
Canada as a result of importing certain fish. Dried barracuda brought back
from Jamaica in 1983 and imported red snapper bought in an Ontario market
were identified sources. This report describes an incident of ciguatera
poisoning which occurred among five patrons of a Montreal restaurant. This
appears to be the first outbreak of ciguatera poisoning in Quebec resulting
from eating fish in a restaurant.
On 11 November 1996, the menu of a Montreal restaurant offered oven-baked
barracuda, served with vegetables and stewed tomatoes. In all cases, the
fish was prepared in the same manner and eaten at lunchtime. All five
cases became ill the same day they ate the meal. On 21 November 1996, a
medical doctor advised the Infectious Disease Unit (IDU) of the Direction
de la santé publique de Montréal-Centre of two cases of ciguatera fish
poisoning in persons who had eaten barracuda in the Montreal restaurant.
Summary: The average age of the persons affected was 40.3 years (range: 31
to 65). The initial symptoms were gastrointestinal in 100% of the cases
and neurologic in 20%. One single case presented both types of symptoms
simultaneously. The average incubation period was 3 hours and 5 minutes
(range: 1 hour and 45 minutes to 5 hours). Five individuals ate the
barracuda at this restaurant and all five became sick, i.e. 100% were
affected. Four cases were contacted 6 months later to verify if they still
had any symptoms. Each had experienced temperature inversion, which had
disappeared within 2 to 4 months. Case 1 reported intermittant spontaneous
burning sensations upon contact with the surrounding air as well as
pruritus. Case 2 had no symptoms after the initial attack. Case 3
reported myalgia at the time of contact. Case 4 reported pruritis after
consuming alcohol and certain foods (e.g. cheese and certain types of
meat). This case also mentioned insomnia, dizzyness, and aching in the jaw.
Discussion: The symptoms experienced by the cases in this incident are
typical of ciguatera fish poisoning. Ciguatoxin is thermostable, and is
not destroyed by cooking or other fish-processing methods. It is odourless
and does not alter the taste or appearance of the fish. Therefore, it is
impossible to easily identify a fish that may be contaminated by the toxin.
This type of poisoning may be prevented by informing consumers of the
potential risks of ciguatera poisoning associated with certain types of
fish; highly susceptible species should be avoided. If one wishes to eat
them, it is extremely important to avoid the larger varieties such as
barracuda. As a general rule, large mature carnivorous fish, which are
located at or near the top of the food chain, are more susceptible to
ciguatoxin contamination and the toxin is likely to be present in higher
amounts in these fish. At the present time in Canada, there are no
regulations restricting the importation of barracuda. The federal
government quality management program for importers is currently
investigating ciguatera toxin levels in imported tropical fish; lots of
contaminated fish will be refused entry into Canada (Y. Roy, Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, Montreal: personal communication, 1997).
Conclusion: Ciguatera fish poisoning is usually detected among returning
travellers. However, it is possible to be exposed to ciguatoxin and to
experience its symptoms without leaving Canada. When presented with a
pathognomonic symptomatology involving temperature reversal, a diagnosis of
possible ciguatera poisoning should be considered, even if there is no
prior history of travelling.
