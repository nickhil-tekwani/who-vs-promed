(_Prunus armeniaca_) and peach (_P. persica_) newly reported in Saudi

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cultivated areas with fruit trees in Saudi Arabia are estimated at
233 513 ha [577 000 acres], with an annual production of more than 1.6
million tonnes of fruits. _Prunus necrotic ringspot virus_ (PNRSV), an
important pathogen, had been reported in nearby countries Jordan,
Lebanon, and Syria. In recent years, apricots (_Prunus armeniaca_) and
peaches (_P. persica_) in Al Juof [Al Jawf], [northern] Saudi Arabia,
had been found showing chlorotic rings, necrotic spots, and a shothole
appearance.

To assess viruses of stone fruit trees as possible causal agents,
field surveys were carried out in the spring of 2009. A total of 76
leaf samples (29 apricot and 47 peach trees) were collected for
analysis of PNRSV. Double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) was performed using a commercially
available PNRSV test kit. Results showed that 34 out of 76 leaf
samples (11 apricot and 23 peach) were infected with PNRSV.

RT-PCR run on all samples resulted in the amplification of a 346 bp
fragment, indicating the presence of PNRSV in apricots and peaches in
Saudi Arabia. One amplicon was sequenced and had 99 percent identity
when compared with PNRSV isolate from _P. mahaleb_ [wild rock cherry,
native to the region. - Mod.DHA] and 98 percent identity with PNRSV
from China.

Further investigations are needed for other commercial orchards and
nurseries to assess the incidence of PNRSV in Saudi Arabia. This is
the 1st report of PNRSV in Saudi Arabia.

[_Prunus necrotic ringspot virus_ (PNRSV; genus _Ilarvirus_) infects
a wide range of fruit trees of genus _Prunus_ such as peach,
nectarine, apricot, plum, and cherry, as well as a number of hosts in
other genera including rose, hops, and cucumber. A range of necrotic
diseases with various names are caused by PNRSV, for example apricot
necrotic ringspot, cherry tatter leaf, plum line pattern, and peach
ring spot. Different viral strains show different levels of virulence.
Symptoms may include chlorotic line patterns and ringspots on leaves
which may lead to tissue necrosis ('shotholes'); ringspots, line
patterns and distortions on fruit; shoot dieback and stunting of
trees. Infection may also lead to bud necrosis and severely reduce the
success of budwood grafting in nurseries. PNRSV may occur in
co-infection with other fruit tree viruses, for example _Prune dwarf
virus_.

PNRSV is transmitted by seed and pollen (both to the seed and the
mother plant) at varying rates depending on the host and viral
strains. It can also be spread by mechanical means including
contaminated pruning tools and grafting. Disease management in
orchards mainly relies on phytosanitation and use of certified disease
free planting and grafting material.
