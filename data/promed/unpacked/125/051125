Rajamahendravaram CPI (Communist Party of India) district committee expressed anguish over the death of 6 persons who died due to the mysterious leg-swelling disease in Annavaram, Lakshmi Puram and Pada Mattapalli villages of V R Puram in East Godavari [district, Andhra Pradesh state]. He demanded that the government pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh [about USD 15 000] for the deceased persons. [A lakh is a unit in the Indian numbering system equal to 100 000.]

Former Bhadrachalam MP and CPI (M) State secretariat member Midium Babu Rao said that 32 persons from these 3 villages have been getting treatment at the Government General Hospital in Kakinada and expressed grief over the death of 6 persons. [He stated] that medical experts failed to diagnose the problem.

[The news report is vague on the clinical description of the illness that has affected 32 people and caused the death of 6 people in 3 villages in the East Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. We are only told of "leg swelling", which could be a consequence of heart, kidney or liver involvement, but is too nondescript to warrant further conjecture. ProMED-mail would appreciate a more detailed description of this outbreak from knowledgeable sources.

Rajahmundry (also called Rajamahendravaram), with a population of 341 831 in 2011, is the 6th most populous city in East Godavari district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajahmundry). Kakinada is the 4th most populous city in Andhra Pradesh and the district headquarters of East Godavari district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakinada). V.R. Puram is a village in East Godavari district (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vararamachandrapuram).
