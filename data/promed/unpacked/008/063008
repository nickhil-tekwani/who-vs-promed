A year after Marinduque was devastated by Supertyphoon "Reming" on 30
Nov 2006, the province's coconut industry has yet to recover. Teofila
Ferrer Lingon, officer in charge of the Philippine Coconut Authority
[PCA] in Marinduque, said that of the 35 448 hectares (87 594 acres)
of coconut plantations in the province, only less than 25 percent had
harvestable trees as of the end of November [2007]. She also said
nothing more could be expected for December.

In Peso value, the harvest of coconut for 2007 would amount to only
PHP 11 million (USD 265 000), which is a far cry from the annual
average of almost PHP 320 million (approx. USD 7.7 million) income on
the basis of 8 harvests per year. Lingon said the low production was
caused by the fact that typhoon-damaged coconut trees usually take at
least one year to recover and coconut farmers were able to harvest
only once this year [2007]. Coconut harvests started only in
September.

Lingon was, however, thankful despite the low production because the
province's coconut trees were spared from the infestation of
_Brontispa longissima_ or coconut leaf beetle that is now plaguing
other coconut-producing provinces. The local PCA office, however, is
monitoring this pest as there were reported beetle infestations in
Barangay Malibago. They found out that the bugs were not of the
brontispa type but Asiatic palm weevils, while other trees were
infested by coconut bud rot, a type of coconut tree disease.

Coconut farming is the primary industry of Marinduque with about 19
000 farmers dependent on it.

[Bud rot is one of the worst diseases of coconut palm and also
affects other palm species. A number of fungi (including several
_Phytophthora_ species) can be associated with it in different
geographical areas, but in Southeast Asia _Phytophthora palmivora_ is
the prevalent species involved in the disease. On coconut (and other
palms), an early symptom is the discoloration of the spear leaf
(youngest unexpanded leaf). As the infected spear leaf unfolds,
large, dark brown frond rots are produced that progress into the leaf
base killing the bud. A foul smell is emitted by the rotting tissue
and the spear leaf can be easily pulled out. Older leaves are
supported by the vascular system in the older part of the trunk and
remain green for months. Eventually all leaves are lost leaving only
the dead trunk.

Bud rot affects palms of all ages, but young palms are found to be
most vulnerable. Disease incidence is usually more severe during
times when the relative humidity is high. The fungus is spread by
insects, mechanical means, plant debris, rain, and wind, and it can
remain dormant in the leaf base during times of dry conditions.
Disease management includes cultural practices (phytosanitary
measures, nutritional improvements), removal and burning of severely
affected palms, and fungicide treatments of palms with early or no
symptoms.

_P. palmivora_ is a very common pathogen in tropical environments
causing rotting diseases on more than 150 host species. It also
causes black pod disease of cocoa, which, on average, claims 20-30
percent of the worlds' crop each year. Some other commercially
important hosts are black pepper, rubber, durian, breadfruit, and
papaya.

A bud rot outbreak on Marinduque Island is not surprising. Typhoon
damage to the palms would have provided entry portals for the
pathogen, and the insects reported in the area are likely to be
active in spreading the disease.
