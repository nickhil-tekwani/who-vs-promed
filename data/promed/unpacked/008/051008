At least 5 patients tested positive for hepatitis C after receiving injections at a Santa Barbara [California] doctor's medical office, public health officials said. Now, the Santa Barbara County Public Health Department is urging any patients who visited the medical office of Allen Thomashefsky to get tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.

Public health officials performed 2 inspections at the doctor's office in November 2014 after they received information that a patient with no known risk factors developed hepatitis C after a visit. The patient underwent multiple injections at his office. Inspectors examined the office and found unsafe practices that put patients at risk for bloodborne viruses as well as joint infections, according to the department. Public health officials say inspectors found that standard infection control procedures were not practiced. The multiple medical breaches led public health officials to order the doctor to close his office, which was done 19 Mar 2015.

The doctor performed regenerative injection therapy, or prolotherapy, to treat patients with chronic muscle or joint pain.

The Oregon Medical Board is also investigating the doctor and has limited his medical practice in the state. The doctor, who has an office in Ashland, Oregon, was ordered 14 Apr 2015 to stop performing injection procedures.

Four of the 5 patients who tested positive for hepatitis C had undergone injection procedures at his medical office on the same day they became infected [see below - Mod.LL]. Three patients had no known risk factors for hepatitis C, an infection that attacks the liver and causes inflammation. Public health officials have performed 240 tests and no patients have tested positive for HIV. The department has been contacting the doctor's patients who received injections in the last 7 years.

The CDC is also performing molecular genetic testing to determine if the hepatitis C virus found in the infected patients originates from the same source. The public health department and the CDC are investigating the outbreak.

[The following was obtained from a website promoting prolotherapy (http://www.prolotherapy.com):

"Prolotherapy is a nonsurgical treatment which stimulates healing. Short for 'proliferation therapy,' Prolotherapy is also known as nonsurgical ligament and tendon reconstruction, or regenerative injection therapy. Prolotherapy works by stimulating the body's own natural healing mechanisms to repair injured musculoskeletal tissue. The treatment originated in the 1930's when Dr. Earl Gedney, an osteopathic surgeon successfully treated his own severe hand injury. Prolotherapy works by getting the body to use its own natural healing mechanisms to repair injured and painful joint areas. Types of Prolotherapy include Dextrose Prolotherapy, Platelet Rich Plasma Prolotherapy (referred to as 'PRP') or bone marrow and/or fat (adipose) tissue from an individual's own body which contain adult stem stromal cells (known as Biocellular Prolotherapy)."

Below are 2 selected reports about the technology:

From abstract:
----------------
"By comparison with placebo, reductions in pain were reported after injections of sodium hyaluronate (short [3.91, 3.54-4.28, p less than 0.0001], intermediate [2.89, 2.58-3.20, p less than 0.0001], and long [3.91, 3.55-4.28, p less than 0.0001] terms), botulinum toxin (short term [1.23, 0.67-1.78, p less than 0.0001]), and prolotherapy (intermediate term [2.62, 1.36-3.88, p less than 0.0001]) for treatment of lateral epicondylalgia. Lauromacrogol (polidocanol), aprotinin, and platelet-rich plasma were not more efficacious than was placebo for Achilles tendinopathy, while prolotherapy was not more effective than was eccentric exercise."

Distel LM, Best TM: Prolotherapy: a clinical review of its role in treating chronic musculoskeletal pain. PMR. 2011;6 Suppl 1):S78-81.
Abstract:
---------
"Prolotherapy is a technique that involves the injection of an irritant, usually a hyperosmolar dextrose solution, typically in the treatment of chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions. Despite its long history and widespread use as a form of complementary therapy, there still are disparities over its optimal indications and injection preparations. There are, however, numerous studies available regarding the use and efficacy of prolotherapy for various musculoskeletal conditions. The most frequently published indication is in the treatment of chronic low back pain, but there are recent studies that examined its use in the management of refractory tendinopathies as well as osteoarthritis. There is growing evidence to suggest that prolotherapy may be helpful in treating chronic low back pain when coupled with adjunctive therapies, such as spinal manipulation or corticosteroid injections. There is also evidence to suggest that prolotherapy is effective in treating refractory tendinopathies, particularly for lateral epicondylosis and Achilles tendinopathy. Additional larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to make specific recommendations regarding ideal protocols and indications. There is emerging evidence for the use of prolotherapy as a treatment option for osteoarthritis; however, further studies are needed to conclusively demonstrate its efficacy. Overall, prolotherapy remains a promising option for the treatment of painful musculoskeletal conditions, particularly when other standard treatments have proved ineffective."

Whether the therapy is effective or not is not the issue here, but rather that injections of substances have to be non-infectious. The inadequate infection control techniques used in the doctor's office are what caused the presumed transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is not clear what information the statement "4 of the 5 patients who tested positive for hepatitis C had undergone injection procedures at his medical office on the same day they became infected" is based on, as HCV viral load (the 1st HCV marker to become positive) is not likely to be detectable on the day of exposure.

Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can lead to lifelong (chronic) infection and can cause serious liver damage (cirrhosis or liver cancer) and death. About 80 percent or more of people infected with HCV have mild or no signs or symptoms initially. Symptoms may include tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, vomiting, dark urine or jaundice (i.e., yellowing of skin or whites of eyes). Some people recover fully, but 85 percent or more of infected people carry the virus in their blood for a lifetime and develop chronic infection. New therapies for HCV have been developed with excellent cure rates, even in those co-infected with HIV and HCV, but the drug costs have limited use at this time. - Mod.LL
