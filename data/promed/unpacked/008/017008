Two truck drivers in central China have turned themselves in to police
after their vehicle's toxic cargo leaked along a highway for several
kilometres, killing one person and poisoning at least 125, state media said.
Villagers along a 5-km (3-mile) stretch of highway in central China's Hubei
province suffered chest pains and stinging eyes after cancer-causing
dimethyl sulphate leaked onto the road from the truck's tank on Tuesday
night, Xinhua news agency reported on Thursday.
The driver of a car behind the truck died from the fumes, Xinhua said. By
Friday, 125 people had been admitted to hospital.
"Thirty people suffered medium-to-heavy poisoning, and the rest were mildly
poisoned," Xinhua said.
Dimethyl sulphate is a highly toxic chemical used in pesticides and
industrial dyes which can lead to blindness, kidney and liver damage if
inhaled or absorbed through the skin in heavy doses.

[Dimethyl sulphate is the dimethyl ester of sulfuric
acid<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester><http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid>.
Under normal conditions, it is a colorless liquid that is slightly oily
with a faint smell of garlic or onion. The compound is generally regarded
as carcinogenic. Dimethyl sulphate can result in clinical signs and
symptoms when absorption occurs through the skin, through gastrointestinal
absorption, or through contact with mucous membranes. Delayed toxicity can
be fatal. It is considered a carcinogen. It is also believed that this
agent may cause reproductive damage. - Mod.TG]
