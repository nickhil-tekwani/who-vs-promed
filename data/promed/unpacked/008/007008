Hepatitis A outbreak in Italy, 2013: a matched case-control study
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Montano-Remacha C, Ricotta L, Alfonsi V, et al]

Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is highly transmissible and one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infections. It occurs worldwide, both sporadically and in the form of epidemics, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences in time. Every year an estimated 1.4 million cases of hepatitis A occur worldwide [1].

The incubation period of hepatitis A (HA) is usually between 28 and 30 days (maximum range 15-50 days) [2], and while the disease is often asymptomatic in children under 5 years-old, its severity increases with age in adults over 18 years-old [2]. HAV, which can be stable in the environment for several months is able to survive freezing [3], and can be transmitted through contaminated water and food as well as from person to person, by the fecal-oral route [1,4]. Other relevant risk factors associated with HAV are travel to highly endemic areas [5] as well as individual high-risk behaviors (such as for people who inject drugs or use other illicit drugs, for men who have sex with men, and for people using contaminated blood products [2]).

In Italy, HA is mandatorily reported to the Italian National Surveillance System (Ministerial Decree (DM) of 15 Dec 1990) [6]. A sentinel surveillance system for acute viral hepatitis (SEIEVA-Sistema Epidemiologico Integrato Epatiti Virali Acute), which was implemented in 1984 [7] is also in place to strengthen the surveillance and to promote the investigation and control of acute viral hepatitis.

HA in Italy arises both in sporadic and endemic-epidemic forms, with some regions in the south (such as Apulia and in Campania) permanently affected by the disease [8-10]. Since the early 1990s, in line with a global trend and as the result of improved sanitation and socio-economic conditions, the epidemiology of HAV has greatly changed in the country, with a clear decline in the numbers of cases over the years, whereby the incidence of HAV dropped from 4 per 100 000 in 1991 to 1.4 per 100 000 in 2006 [11]. Over the last decade, the disease incidence further declined and was below 1 per 100 000 in the last 2 years before the outbreak reported here.

The outbreak
------------
A new outbreak has been ongoing in Italy since 2013. Epidemiological data showed a clear increase in the incidence of HA from 1 Jan to 31 May 2013 compared to the same period of the previous 3 years [8]. The highest increase in numbers of patients affected by HA was observed in northern Italy, in particular in the regions of Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, Lombardy, Piedmont, Trento and Bolzano, and Veneto. Apulia (south Italy) also showed an increase in the number of cases in 2013. In May 2013, some European Union Member States (Germany, Netherlands, Poland) reported cases of HA linked to a ski holiday in northern Italy (autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano). After this notification, a retrospective epidemiological investigation started in the provinces of Trento and Bolzano. whereby cases notified to the local health units were contacted. Sequencing of the virion protein (VP)1-2a region of the virus derived from 5 cases residing in these provinces, a Dutch, and 2 German cases revealed 100 percent sequence similarity between all isolates. Thus the outbreak strain was characterised and submitted to GenBank (GenBank accession number: KF182323). The preliminary epidemiological investigation in the autonomous provinces (AP) of Trento and Bolzano showed that the only common food consumed by different cases had been mixed berries. Frozen mixed berries eaten by cases in another region, Veneto, were found positive for HAV and the VP1-2a region of the viral sequence derived from the berries showed 100 percent sequence similarity with that of the cases' isolates, so more samples of frozen mixed berries were collected throughout the country and to date a total of 15 frozen mixed berry samples in Italy have been found positive for HAV [8,12].

As soon as the outbreak was detected, a series of actions and control measures were undertaken by the Italian health authorities including enhanced of surveillance and awareness of HAV, the collection of additional epidemiological information on associated risk factors, and the characterization of the virus RNA by genotyping and sequencing of the VP1-2a region from all new cases [13,14], since normally in Italy genotyping and sequencing are not performed on a routine basis.

Moreover, the voluntary recall of the confirmed mixed frozen berries batches was performed and advice to the population regarding the use of frozen mixed berries was given (that is, advice in supermarket and shops to cook frozen berries for 2 minutes). In addition risk communication concerning the consumption of frozen berries (that is, cook frozen berries for 2 minutes) was provided to the general public through Ministry of Health (MoH) and Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) websites.

Through a Ministerial Directive on 23 May 2013, the Italian MoH designated a task force of experts from different professions to participate in the management of the HAV outbreak in Italy in 2013. In this framework, an analytic epidemiological study was planned in some of the Italian regions (Apulia, AP of Bolzano, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia-Giulia, and AP of Trento) that experienced the highest increase of HAV cases.

Results
-------
The matched case-control study included 119 sets of cases and controls. A total of 588 subjects were interviewed (127 cases and 461 controls). In Figure 1 [for figures and tables, see source URL above. - Mod.LL] the epidemic curve is reported. The number of cases increased progressively, peaking at week 20 [week of 15 May 2013]. As of June 2013 the outbreak was still ongoing. 2 cases were excluded due to lack of appropriately matched controls within the specified time frame; another 6 cases that were part of a family cluster due to a common source of infection were also excluded. An additional, 42 controls were excluded due to at least 1 of the exclusion criteria being present. Thus, the study included a total of 538 subjects, 119 cases (22 percent), and 419 controls (78 percent). The median age was 37.0 years (range: 3-70) for HAV cases and 38.0 years (range: 1-72) for controls (p=0.6384). The majority of study participants in both groups were male. No significant difference in the sex of cases and controls was observed. As a result a median of 3.5 controls for each case were included in the study.

Most of the HAV cases involved in the study, 68/119 (57 percent), were from the region of Emilia Romagna (Figure 2).

Univariate and multivariate analysis:
In the univariate analysis, compared with the 419 controls, cases were more likely to have eaten berries (OR [odds ratio]: 4.42; 95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 2.70-7.27), raw seafood (OR: 4.65; 95 percent CI: 2.70-8.00), or traveled (OR: 2.34; 95 percent CI: 1.45-3.77) (Table 1). In the multivariate analysis, the highest association with illness was for people who had consumed berries (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj): 4.2; 95 percent CI: 2.54-7.02).

Among those who reported berry consumption, the majority had eaten berries at home (70 percent, 169/240) or at a restaurant (15 percent, 36/240). The food types consumed that included berries were: yogurt (36 percent, 86/240), cakes (28 percent, 67/240), ice cream (21 percent, 51/240), panna cotta (8 percent, 19/240), cheesecake (5 percent, 13/240), cornflakes (5 percent, 11/240), and fruit juices (1 percent, 2/240). Other subjects (5 percent, 12/240) consumed only berries. The types of berries consumed were: blueberries (7 percent, 16/240), strawberries (3 percent, 7/240), raspberries (3 percent, 6/240), blackberries (3 percent, 6/240), red currants (2 percent, 4/240), and mixed berries (82 percent, 197/240).

Raw seafood was found to have the 2nd highest significant association with HAV (ORadj: 3.83; 95 percent CI: 2.54-7.02) with the 3rd highest factor being history of travel (ORadj: 1.98; 95 percent CI: 1.15-3.41). The majority of the cases (60 percent) referring to having traveled during the incubation period indicated Italy as the destination (distributed as 61 percent in the north of Italy, 21 percent in the centre of Italy, and 17 percent in the south). The 30 percent of the subjects who travelled abroad indicated a country outside of Europe. The remaining 10 percent indicated a travel history in European countries other than Italy.

PAF (population attributable factor) was the same (26 percent) for berries and raw seafood, meaning that the impact of both risk factors was similar, while PAF for travel was lower (16 percent).

Of the 119 cases enrolled in the case-control study, 24 had respective viral sequence information within the time of the study. The sequenced viruses were identical or highly similar (nucleotide identity between 99.8 percent and 100 percent) to the outbreak strain (HAV genotype 1A), in an RNA sequence of 440 nucleotides overlapping the VP1/P2a region. The outbreak sequence had already been submitted to GenBank prior to this study [8].

A restricted statistical analysis was conducted on the 24 cases and respective 82 controls in order to confirm the above described results. 12 of the 24 cases were from the AP of Trento, 7 from Apulia, 4 from Emilia Romagna and 1 from the AP of Bolzano. 17 of the 24 cases (71 percent) ate berries and 10 (42 percent) ate raw seafood. All the 24 cases and 82 controls were included in the restricted analysis with no significant difference in the sex of cases and controls observed.

The statistical analysis (Table 2) identified berries as the highest associated risk factor for developing the disease (ORadj: 4.99; 95 percent CI: 1.32-18.92) followed by raw seafood (ORadj: 4.46; 95 percent CI: 1.10-18.04). As all cases from the Apulia region reported to have eaten raw seafood, an analysis excluding cases from this region was undertaken resulting in berries being the unique risk factor for the disease with an OR of 7.29 (95 percent CI: 1.56-34.02).

Discussion
----------
The analytical investigation conducted in Italy indicated that the consumption raw seafood or berries constituted risk factors for HA. The highest significant association with illness was however found for berries, which were the most likely source of the outbreak. Berries, as the most implicated risk factor in a HAV foodborne outbreak, is a new finding in Italy.

During the outbreak we were also able to demonstrate that the sequences derived from cases were 100 percent similar to the sequences isolated in frozen berry food samples [8]. The same sequence has also been isolated 2008 and 2009 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia as well as in Ireland among men who have sex with men (MSM) [19,20]. Sequence analysis of HAV RNA-positive samples, of some of the enrolled cases in the study, showed that all the cases tested had an identical IA genotype, supporting the hypothesis of a widespread, common source of infection.

Since HAV genotyping and sequencing is not performed on a routine basis in Italy we cannot compare the current outbreak genotype with previously identified Italian genotypes. The exception is for the Campania and Apulia regions, where HAV is endemic. The phylogenetic analysis conducted in Apulia between 2008 and 2009 revealed the co-circulation of subtypes IA (74 percent) and IB (26 percent) clustering with strains from Germany and France, and with those previously circulating in the region [17]. The sequence from the outbreak reported here was different from sequences of genotype IA found in Apulia in 2008 and 2009. In Campania, laboratory investigations conducted during an outbreak in 2004 showed the 1B HAV genotype as the most common circulating strain (90 percent of sera) [10].

Consumption of fresh or frozen produce is known to be associated with outbreaks of foodborne enteric viruses, particularly norovirus and HAV [21]. Produce (fruits and vegetables) can become contaminated during cultivation prior to harvest due to contact with inadequately treated sewage or sewage polluted water, or fomites. Contamination may also occur by infected food handlers, during harvesting, processing, storage, distribution or final preparation, with the virus likely to be found on the surface of the food. Fruits and vegetable are more prone to being the vehicle of foodborne infections as they are more likely to be left uncooked before consumption [22]. Berries as a vehicle for transmission of HAV, have been described in several outbreaks with most of the infections connected with consumption of minimally processed frozen berries [22].

Furthermore, it has been shown that among berries (frozen raspberries in particular) and vegetables (that is, parsley) those with uneven shapes are more likely to retain viruses on their surface. Raspberries, for example, have crevices and hair-like projections which may prevent the virus from being removed by rinsing [21].

Recently outbreaks connected to berry consumption have been reported in some Nordic European countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) [23] and in the United States [24]. The outbreak in Nordic countries was associated to frozen strawberries [25,26] while the outbreak in the United States was associated to Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend, a frozen blend containing a pomegranate seed mix [24]. However, the virus genotype 1A isolated to the Italian outbreak is different from the virus genotypes implicated in the above mentioned recent outbreaks (genotype 1B), which also have frozen strawberries and berries as the suspected vehicles [25,26].

The main limitation of this study is the recall bias: as the incubation period of hepatitis A occurs over a long period of time (range 15-50 days), the food consumption history in the weeks before symptom onset may be vague and better remembered by cases than by controls. Another possible limitation is due to some controls being not susceptible to HAV (having forgotten if they had been vaccinated or had asymptomatic infection); this underestimated the association between outcome and exposure of interest. Another limitation was that no other known hepatitis A exposures (such as persons who inject drugs, male same-sex sexual contact) were taken into consideration.

An additional limitation is that we were unable to compare cases and controls by exposure to different types of berries consumed, due to both cases and controls inability to discriminate between fresh or frozen berries and because most of them reported consuming a mix of berries.

Compared with international findings on viral foodborne outbreaks, what is new in this Italian outbreak associated to berries is that the epidemic involved a large number of people over a wide area. Because the batches of frozen berries consumed by some of the cases were composed of a mixture of berries respectively originating from different lots, it has been difficult to trace-back the origins of each type of berry.

Rapid and effective monitoring is critical for detecting outbreaks and new risk factors for infectious diseases. For this reason, as soon as the outbreak was confirmed [8], the MoH enhanced the national surveillance system and undertook appropriate control measures that are still in place: voluntary recall of the confirmed frozen mixed berries batches and advice to the population regarding the use of the frozen mixed berries already purchased or still available in retail (that is, advice in supermarket and shops to cook frozen berries for 2 minutes). Moreover, risk communication to the general population through MoH and Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS) websites concerning the consumption of frozen berries (that is, cook frozen berries for 2 minutes) was done. Frozen berries were also included as another potential risk factor in the epidemiological investigation and sequencing of the virus affecting HA cases was requested.

The Italian national reference laboratories (for human and food investigation) and the public health authorities are conducting epidemiological and laboratory investigations as well as trace-back and trace-forward investigations in parallel. The collaboration between the surveillance system for foodborne diseases and the molecular epidemiology has been essential to understand the risk factors associated with this outbreak.

In the future, attention should be paid to the prevention of contamination before or during food processing by implementation of good agricultural, hygienic and manufacturing practices, as well as hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP) systems. Continuous health education would also be helpful in the effective control of hepatitis A.
