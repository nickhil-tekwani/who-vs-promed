Abstract
--------
Background: _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C (NmC) outbreaks occur infrequently in the African meningitis belt; the most recent report of an outbreak of this serogroup was in Burkina Faso, 1979. Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF) has been responding to outbreaks of meningitis in northwest Nigeria since 2007 with no reported cases of serogroup C from 2007-2012. MenAfrivac (R), a serogroup A conjugate vaccine, was first used for mass vaccination in northwest Nigeria in late 2012. Reactive vaccination using polysaccharide ACYW135 vaccine was done by MSF in parts of the region in 2008 and 2009; no other vaccination campaigns are known to have occurred in the area during this period. We describe the general characteristics of an outbreak due to a novel strain of NmC in Sokoto State, Nigeria, in 2013, and a smaller outbreak in 2014 in the adjacent state, Kebbi.

Methods: Information on cases and deaths was collected using a standard line-list during each week of each meningitis outbreak in 2013 and 2014 in northwest Nigeria. Initial serogroup confirmation was by rapid Pastorex agglutination tests. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from suspected meningitis patients were sent to the WHO Reference Laboratory in Oslo, where bacterial isolates, serogrouping, antimicrobial sensitivity testing, genotype characterisation and real-time PCR analysis were performed.

Results: In the most highly affected outbreak areas, all of the 856 and 333 clinically suspected meningitis cases were treated in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Overall attack (AR) and case fatality (CFR) rates were 673/100 000 population and 6.8 percent in 2013, and 165/100 000 and 10.5 percent in 2014. Both outbreaks affected small geographical areas of less than 150 sq km [58 sq mi] and populations of less than 210 000, and occurred in neighbouring regions in 2 adjacent states in the successive years. Initial rapid testing identified NmC as the causative agent. Of the 21 and 17 CSF samples analysed in Oslo, NmC alone was confirmed in 11 and 10 samples in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Samples confirmed as NmC through bacterial culture had sequence type (ST)-10217.

Conclusions: These are the 1st recorded outbreaks of NmC in the region since 1979, and the sequence (ST)-10217 has not been identified anywhere else in the world. The outbreaks had similar characteristics to previously recorded NmC outbreaks. Outbreaks of NmC in 2 consecutive years in northern Nigeria indicate a possible emergence of this serogroup. Increased surveillance for multiple serogroups in the region is needed, along with consideration of vaccination with conjugate vaccines rather than for NmA alone.

[The article above published in PLOS describes in greater detail the outbreaks in Nigeria previously reported in ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria: serogroup C, WHO 20150317.3236196. The full article with tables, figures, and references can be obtained at the source URL above. The authors recommend the following:

"NmC outbreaks have emerged in northwest Nigeria in the past 2 years, and there is some evidence of serogroup replacement in the meningitis belt following recent mass vaccination with NmA conjugate vaccine. Meningitis case surveillance systems, for both serogroup and strain, should continue to be strengthened in this region to allow for early identification and proper control (such as vaccination for the appropriate serogroup) of outbreaks. If NmC outbreaks become more widespread in northern Nigeria or adjacent regions in the coming years, large-scale preventative action may be required; a key measure is to ensure availability of ACYW135 polysaccharide vaccine for reactive vaccination."

WHO promotes a strategy of epidemic prevention and response in the African meningitis belt. Prevention has consisted of vaccinating all 1-29 year-olds in the African meningitis belt with the MenA conjugate vaccine. As of January 2015, over 217 million persons in 15 of the 26 countries of the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa have received meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). WHO epidemic response consists of "prompt and appropriate case management with ceftriaxone and reactive mass vaccination of populations not already protected through vaccination."

The presence of circulating bactericidal antibody at the time of exposure appears to be critical for protection against meningococcal disease. The antibody response to the polysaccharide antigen present in a vaccine is serogroup specific and affords no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. In view of replacement of meningococcal serogroup A with other serogroups following mass vaccination of the population with serogroup A conjugate vaccine, reactive mass vaccination to control an outbreak would require use of a meningococcal vaccine containing the serogroup causing the particular outbreak.

Several vaccines are available to control the disease during an outbreak: a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine, C conjugate vaccines, tetravalent A, C, Y, and W conjugate vaccines and meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines. Unlike polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and therefore longer-term protection, than the polysaccharide vaccines.

The 2 quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines that provide protection against meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, and Y (MenACWY-D [Menactra, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur] and MenACWY-CRM [Menveo, manufactured by Novartis Vaccines]) are licensed in the United States as a single dose for use among persons aged 2 through 55 years. Menactra is also licensed as a 2-dose series for infants and toddlers aged 9 through 23 months. Quadrivalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4 [Menommune, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur]) is the only vaccine licensed for use among persons aged 56 years and older. - Mod.ML
