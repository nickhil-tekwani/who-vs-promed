Disease risk prompts warning to Northwest beachcombers
-----------------------------------------------
Oregon and Washington beachcombers are advised to keep their distance
from all marine mammals.
The warning was issued by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department
on Friday [15 Oct 2004] after it received an increased number of
reports of sea lions found dead, dying, or sick on beaches. Some of
the animals in Washington were found to have the bacterial infection
leptospirosis, which affects kidney function in mammals, including
horses and dogs.
Leptospirosis can spread to humans through exposure to urine or
urine-contaminated water or soil. "I don't think people need to be
scared to go to the beach or touch the sand," said Tamara McGuire,
coordinator of the Oregon Marine Mammal stranding network for Oregon
State University. "I think the most important thing is that they need
to stay back anytime they see a marine mammal on the beach. If anyone
else is on the beach, advise them to stay back, and keep their pets
back."
So far this year [2004], there have been no confirmed cases of
mammals with leptospirosis in Oregon, McGuire said.
Anyone who is concerned about a marine mammal is asked to call the
stranding hot line at (800) 452-7888.

[Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and
animals. It is caused by bacteria of the genus _Leptospira_. In
humans, it causes a wide range of symptoms, and some infected persons
may have no symptoms at all. Symptoms of leptospirosis include high
fever, severe headache, chills, muscle aches, and vomiting, and may
include jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), red eyes, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, or a rash. If the disease is not treated, the patient could
develop kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane
around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, and respiratory
distress. In rare cases, death occurs.
Many of these symptoms can be mistaken for other diseases.
Leptospirosis is confirmed by laboratory testing of a blood or urine
sample.
Outbreaks of leptospirosis are usually caused by exposure to water
contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Many different kinds
of animals carry the bacterium; they may become sick but sometimes
have no symptoms. _Leptospira_ organisms have been found in cattle,
pigs, horses, dogs, rodents, and wild animals, including marine
mammals. Humans become infected through contact with water, food, or
soil containing urine from these infected animals. This may happen by
swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact,
especially with mucosal surfaces such as the eyes or nose, or with
broken skin. The disease is not known to be spread from person to
person.
The time between a person's exposure to a contaminated source and
becoming sick is 2 days to 4 weeks. Illness usually begins abruptly
with fever and other symptoms. Leptospirosis may occur in 2 phases;
after the 1st phase, with fever, chills, headache, muscle aches,
vomiting, or diarrhea, the patient may recover for a time but become
ill again. If a 2nd phase occurs, it is more severe; the person may
have kidney or liver failure or meningitis. This phase is also called
Weil's disease.
The illness lasts from a few days to 3 weeks, or longer. Without
treatment, recovery may take several months.
Leptospirosis occurs worldwide but is most common in temperate or
tropical climates. It is an occupational hazard for many people who
work outdoors or with animals, including farmers, sewer workers,
veterinarians, fish workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. It
is a recreational hazard for campers, or those who participate in
outdoor sports in contaminated areas, and has been associated with
swimming, wading, and whitewater rafting in contaminated lakes and
rivers. The incidence is also increasing among urban children.
Leptospirosis is treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or
penicillin, which should be given early in the course of the disease.
Intravenous antibiotics may be required for persons with more severe
symptoms. Persons with symptoms suggestive of leptospirosis should
contact a health care provider.
Pets may acquire the disease as well. The clinical signs of
leptospirosis vary and are nonspecific. Sometimes pets do not have
any signs. Clinical signs in dogs include fever, vomiting, abdominal
pain, diarrhea, refusal to eat, severe weakness, depression,
stiffness, severe muscle pain, or inability to have puppies.
Generally, younger animals are more seriously affected than older
animals. Portions of this comment have been extracted from the CDC
website. - Mod.TG]
