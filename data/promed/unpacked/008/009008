Influenza Update Number 215
---------------------------
Summary
-------
Globally, influenza activity remained low, with gradual increase of influenza activity in the southern hemisphere; however, in Chile, influenza activity was relatively high.

- In North America and Europe, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels in most countries with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus predominating, although influenza activity was still slightly increasing in the south region of China, mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
- In southern and south-eastern Asia, influenza activity continued to decline, except for Singapore that showed a sustained increase in influenza detection rates, even while the rate for influenza-like illness (ILI) activity and acute respiratory infections remained low.
- In northern Africa and western Asia, influenza activity remained low.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity increased but was generally at a low level, except for Chile which showed influenza activity similar to last year's [2013] peak, with mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections. In South Africa the influenza detection rate increased mainly due to influenza A(H3N2).
- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 14 Jul 2014, 14:55 UTC), during weeks 25 to 26 (15 Jun 2014 to 28 Jun 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 70 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 29 795 specimens. 2748 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 2230 (81.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 517 (18.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 257 (12.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1740 (87.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 123 (93.9 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 8 (6.1 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

---------------------
Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America and Europe
In North America and Europe, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels in all countries with low circulation of influenza B virus within expected levels for this time of year [July].

Northern Africa and the western and central Asia region:
In northern Africa and central and western Asia, influenza activity remained low in the majority of countries. In Tunisia and Egypt, the proportion of influenza positive specimens was higher than the previous weeks with most cases identified as influenza B viruses although a small number of samples were tested. Bahrain reported stable influenza activity mainly due to a low circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in recent weeks. The Islamic Republic of Iran continued to report an increase in influenza detections (mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B). Oman reported stable detection of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 since March [2014].

Eastern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low and continued to decline. Influenza A(H3N2) was the main virus in circulation with some influenza B also detected. In southern China, although influenza-like illness (ILI) rates decreased slightly, they were higher than expected for this time of the year. Similar to historical trends at this time of the year, influenza activity showed an increase with mainly influenza A(H3N2) detections. In northern China, Japan and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean:
The overall influenza activity in Central America, the Caribbean, and tropical areas of South America was at low levels. The Dominican Republic reported a few cases of influenza A(H3N2). In the tropical areas of El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, and Puerto Rico, levels of respiratory infection remained low with increased detection of influenza B virus. The Plurinational State of Bolivia reported respiratory virus circulation with increased levels of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 detected. In Colombia and Venezuela, increased influenza A(H3N2) was detected, but remained within expected levels.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, overall influenza activity reported from western, middle, and eastern Africa was at low levels, with the exception of Cameroon and Kenya. Cameroon reported a decrease in influenza activity compared to the previous week, with mainly influenza A(H3N2) activity, but the levels remain high for this time of the year. In Kenya, influenza activity continued with mostly influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 virus and some influenza A(H3N2) virus as well. Ghana and the United Republic of Tanzania reported an increase in influenza B detection.

Tropical Asia
In most southern Asian and south-eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low. In Lao People's Democratic Republic, Thailand and Viet Nam, influenza activity was decreasing. Singapore reported higher numbers of influenza positive samples (with mainly influenza B), but with an acute respiratory infection activity level below baseline levels. India and Sri Lanka reported some influenza activity with mostly influenza A(H3N2) virus detected.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America
In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity continued to increase but remained low in most countries, except for Chile where influenza activity together with ILI and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) reached high levels. In Argentina, influenza detection, ILI and SARI increased but remained low compared to the usual level during winter period. The main respiratory virus detected (91 percent) was respiratory syncytial virus.

In Chile, influenza detection continued to increase with ILI and SARI levels also increasing. In the last week of June [2014], of the positive respiratory samples, a majority (69 percent) were RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], and 15 percent were positive for influenza. The main circulating influenza virus was influenza A(H3N2). In Paraguay, while the percentage of positive influenza cases increased, the ILI consultation rate was similar to the previous week and within the expected levels for this time of the year. Of the positively identified samples most were influenza A(H3N2).

Southern Africa
In South Africa, influenza detection increased with influenza A(H3N2) dominating.

Oceania Melanesia and Polynesia
Both Australia and New Zealand had increased, but still low, levels of influenza activity as well as ILI rates. The main detected virus was influenza A(H1N1)pmd09. In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with a decreasing trend observed in several islands. However, in Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu, ILI activity increased.

[Interested readers are recommended to access the original document where the dates are presented graphically in terms of the "Number of specimens positive for influenza by subtype." Overall there has been no significant change in the global pattern of seasonal influenza, other than the continued predominance of RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) in some parts of southern America. This may merely reflect differences in diagnostic capabilities and/or local interest. No novel genotypes of seasonal influenza viruses have made an appearance in any region of the world.
