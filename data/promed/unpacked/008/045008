Recovery of a Patient from Clinical Rabies; Wisconsin, 2004
-------------------------------------------------
Rabies is a viral infection of the central nervous system, usually
contracted from the bite of an infected animal, and is nearly always fatal
without proper post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) (1). In October 2004, a
previously healthy female aged 15 years in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin,
received a diagnosis of rabies after being bitten by a bat approximately 1
month before symptom onset. This report summarizes the investigation
conducted by the Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH), the public
health response in Fond du Lac County, and the patient's clinical course
through 17 Dec 2004. This is the 1st documented recovery from clinical
rabies by a patient who had not received either pre- or post-exposure
prophylaxis for rabies.
While attending a church service in September, the girl picked up a bat
after she saw it fall to the floor. She released the bat outside the
building; it was not captured for rabies testing, and no one else touched
the bat. While handling the bat, she was bitten on her left index finger.
The wound was approximately 5 mm in length with some blood present at the
margins; it was cleaned with hydrogen peroxide. Medical attention was not
sought, and rabies PEP was not administered.
Approximately 1 month after the bat bite, the girl complained of fatigue
and tingling and numbness of the left hand. These symptoms persisted, and 2
days later she felt unsteady and developed diplopia (i.e., double vision).
On the 3rd day of illness, with continued diplopia and onset of nausea and
vomiting, she was examined by her pediatrician and referred to a
neurologist. At that time, the patient continued to have blurred vision and
also had partial bilateral 6th-nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) with and without contrast and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)
studies of her brain were normal, and the patient was sent home.
On the 4th day of illness, the patient's symptoms continued, and she was
admitted to a local hospital for lumbar puncture and supportive care. On
admission, she was afebrile, alert, and able to follow commands. She had
partial 6th-nerve palsy, blurred vision, and unsteady gait. Standard
precautions for infection control were observed. Lumbar puncture revealed a
white blood cell count of 23 cells/microL (normal: 0 cells/microL) with 93
percent lymphocytes, a red blood cell count of 3 cells/microL (normal: 0
cells/microL), a protein concentration of 50 mg/dL (normal: 15 to 45
mg/dL), and a glucose concentration of 58 mg/dL (normal: 40 to 70 mg/dL).
During the next 36 hours, she had slurred speech, nystagmus, tremors of the
left arm, increased lethargy, and a temperature of 102 F (38.9 C).
On the 6th day of illness, the bat-bite history was reported, and rabies
was considered in the differential diagnosis. The patient was transferred
to a tertiary care hospital. Because rabies was recognized as a
possibility, expanded infection-control measures, including droplet
precautions and one-to-one nursing, were instituted at time of transport.
On arrival, the patient had a temperature of 100.9 F (38.3 C), impaired
muscular coordination, difficulty speaking, double vision, muscular
twitching, and tremors in the left arm. She was somewhat obtunded but
answered questions appropriately and complied with commands.
Blood serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nuchal skin samples, and saliva
were submitted to CDC for rabies testing. MRI with and without contrast and
angiogram/venogram sequences were normal. She had hypersalivation and was
intubated. Rabies virus-specific antibodies were detected in the patient's
serum and CSF. Direct fluorescent antibody staining of nuchal skin biopsies
was negative for viral antigen, and rabies virus was not isolated from
saliva by cell culture. Rabies-virus RNA was not detectable by reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay of either sample. Therefore,
identification of the virus variant responsible for this infection was not
possible.
Clinical management of the patient consisted of supportive care and
neuroprotective measures, including a drug-induced coma and ventilator
support. Intravenous ribavirin was used under an investigational
protocol. The patient was kept comatose for 7 days; during that period,
results from lumbar puncture indicated an increase in antirabies IgG by
immunofluorescent assay from 1:32 to 1:2048. Her coma medications were
tapered, and the patient became increasingly alert. On the 33rd day of
illness, she was extubated; 3 days later she was transferred to a
rehabilitation unit. At the time of transfer, she was unable to speak after
prolonged intubation. As of 17 Dec 2004, the patient remained hospitalized
with steady improvement. She was able to walk with assistance, ride a
stationary cycle for 8 minutes, and feed herself a soft, solid diet. She
solved math puzzles, used sign language, and was regaining the ability to
speak. The prognosis for her full recovery is unknown.
To provide community members accurate information about rabies and its
transmission, local and state health officials held a press conference on
21 Oct 2004. Public health officials and community pediatricians visited
the patient's school to assess the need for rabies prophylaxis among students.
WDPH distributed assessment tools to the local health department to screen
health-care workers and community contacts of the patient for exposure to
potentially infectious secretions. The patient's 5 family members, 5 of 35
health-care workers, and 27 of 55 community contacts received rabies PEP,
either because of exposure to the patient's saliva during sharing of
beverages or food items or after contact with vomitus. No health-care
workers at the tertiary care hospital required PEP. Site inspection of the
church revealed no ongoing risk for exposure to bats.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
This case represents the 6th known occurrence of human recovery after
rabies infection; however, the case is unique because the patient received
no rabies prophylaxis either before or after illness onset. Historically,
the mortality rate among previously unvaccinated rabies patients has been
100 percent (2). The 5 previous patients who survived were either
previously vaccinated (3) or received some form of PEP before the onset of
illness (4, 5, 6, 7). As in this case, viral antigen was not detected nor
was virus isolated from those patients; increased antibody titers detected
in serum and CSF (inconsistent with vaccination alone) confirmed the
diagnosis of clinical rabies. Only one of the 5 patients recovered without
neurologic sequelae (4). No specific course of treatment for rabies in
humans has been demonstrated to be effective, but a combination of
treatments, which might include rabies vaccine, rabies immune globulin,
monoclonal antibodies, ribavirin, interferon-alpha, or ketamine, has been
proposed (2). Given the lack of therapeutic utility observed to date, and
because the patient had rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies on diagnosis,
a decision was made to avoid use of immune-modulators (e.g., rabies
vaccine, rabies immune globulin, or interferon). However, the particular
benefits of the regimen received by this patient remain to be determined.
The history of a bat bite one month before this patient's illness suggests
an etiology of bat-associated rabies virus variant. This is consistent with
the epidemiologic pattern of rabies in humans in the United States during
the preceding 2 decades. During the period 1980 to 2000, a total of 26 (74
percent) of rabies virus variants obtained from patients in the United
States was associated with insectivorous bats, most commonly silver-haired
and eastern pipistrelle bats (8,9), including a variant from a fatal case
of rabies reported in Wisconsin in 2000 (10).
In this case, only 5 health-care workers received PEP. Previous reports of
rabies cases have noted large numbers of contacts being treated (8);
however, delivery of health care to a patient with rabies is not an
indication for PEP unless the mucuous membranes or open wound of a
health-care worker are contaminated by infectious material (e.g., saliva,
tears, CSF, or neurologic tissue). Adherence to standard precautions for
infection control will minimize the risk for exposure (1).
Rabies in humans is preventable with proper wound care and timely and
appropriate administration of PEP before onset of clinical disease (1). PEP
is recommended for all persons with a bite, scratch, or mucous-membrane
exposure to a bat, unless the bat tests negative for rabies. When direct
contact between a human and a bat has occurred and the animal is not
available for testing, PEP should be administered when a strong probability
of exposure exists. However, if a bat bite is unrecognized or if the
significance of exposure is underestimated, medical intervention might not
be sought and appropriate treatment not administered. Once clinical signs
of rabies are evident, a progressive and usually fatal encephalitis ensues.
This report underscores the need for increasing public awareness to
minimize the risk for rabies following contact with bats and other
wildlife. Persons bitten by a potentially rabid animal should immediately:
1) Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water, 2) capture the animal (if
this can be done safely by avoiding direct contact) and submit it for
testing or quarantine, 3) contact local or state public health officials,
and 4) visit a physician for treatment and evaluation regarding the need
for PEP. Persons should not handle or keep bats as pets and should keep
bats away from living quarters and public places. Despite the recovery of
this patient, no proven therapy for clinical rabies has been established,
and the reasons for recovery in this case are unknown. Clinicians and the
public should recognize the risk for contracting rabies from any direct
contact with bats and not regard it as a curable disease on the basis of
the outcome of this case.
