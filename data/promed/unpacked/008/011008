Concerning the message from Chad Meyer requesting information regarding
titers in individuals that received HDCV:
Since 1984 Kansas State University (KSU) has been collecting information on
individuals vaccinated with human rabies vaccines licensed in the USA. The
information that we have collected is from individuals vaccinated across
the USA and from Peace Corps Volunteers. In 1992 we compiled a large
portion of our data, statistically analyzed more than 800 rabies antibody
titer results and reported the following information:
We found no significant difference in the longevity of titers between male
and female and no significant difference due to age. We did report a
significant difference between longevity of titers due to mode of
administration. Those individuals vaccinated HDCV intramuscularly had
titers that lasted significantly longer than those vaccinated
intradermally. In fact at 2 years post vaccination, 93% of non-Peace Corps
Volunteers (non-PCV) still had an adequate titer whereas 74% of non-PCV
vaccinated intradermally had an adequate titer. In Peace Corps Volunteers
(PCV) titers were also significantly lower in those vaccinated
intradermally. In our study we found 73% of non-PCV still had adequate
titers up to 5 years after intramuscular vaccination. (The citation for the
paper is: Briggs and Schwenke. Vaccine. 10: 125-129. 1992.)
Recently a new report by Strady et al. in J. Inf. Dis. 177:1290-1295. 1998,
found adequate titers in individuals up to 10 years after vaccination.
Strady and his colleges conducted a clinical study and were able to track
the subjects during the 10-year period. In this study the subjects were
vaccinated 3 times intramuscularly and then boosted one year later. It is
important to remember that Strady's study was part of a controlled clinical
study whereas the study at KSU was from individuals across the USA and in
the Peace Corps who had been vaccinated by a variety of medical personnel
with varying degrees of experience in administering vaccines.
It is clear that intramuscular administration of rabies vaccines will
provide longer lasting serological titers. The question of which mode of
administration should be used should be discussed between the physician and
the patient receiving the vaccine. There are several factors to be taken
into consideration including: general health of the patient (is there a
history of an immunosuppressive condition?), is the patient travelling to a
foreign country where canine rabies is endemic and where modern cell
culture vaccines are not readily available?, will the patient need to take
an antimalarial drug while he/she is receiving the pre-exposure rabies
vaccination series?, is the medical staff unfamiliar with intradermal
administration? If the answer to any of the above questions is yes, here in
the USA, a physician should recommend rabies pre-exposure with
intramuscular rather than intradermal vaccine.
Many individuals chose to have serological titers checked rather than
routine boosters because of the possibility of delayed hypersensitivity
reaction that has been reported with some individuals that were boosted
with HDCV and due to the possibility of not responding immunologically to
the vaccine with continued routine boosters. It is also important to
remember that although we measure the humoral immune response to the
vaccine, cellular immunity is a critical factor in protecting individuals
from contracting rabies after exposure. Of course, cellular immunity is
much more difficult to measure.
Kansas State University is continuing to monitor the longevity of titers
from individuals vaccinated and boosted with all rabies vaccines licensed
in the USA. I hope these answered some of your questions.

You might want to download a couple of documents from CDC: "Rabies
Prevention -- United States, 1991 Recommendations of the Immunization
Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP)" MMWR 1991, RR40 (3): 1-19 [provides
general guidelines still relevant and in use in the US
http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00041987.htm
"Availability of New Rabies Vaccine for Human Use," MMWR 1998, 47 (1): 12,
19 (provides details on the recently released PCEC vaccine)
http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mm4701.html#TOC
>>Clinicians need to know how long protective immunity persists after a
pre-exposure series of three (days 0, 7, and 21 or 28) intramuscular rabies
vaccines (Human Diploid Cell Vaccine -HDCV, Rabies Vaccine Absorbed - RVA,
or Purified Chick Embryo Cell Vaccine Adsorbed - PCEC). <<
Unfortunately, there is no real answer to this question. Length of
conferred immunity varies with the individual and other circumstances.
>>When a delayed hypersensitivity reaction began to be reported in as many
as 5 percent of booster recipients, some clinicians began to recommend
yearly rabies antibody titers as a guide of when to booster (i.e.
attempting to lengthen the interval between pre-exposure boosters). This is
expensive, labor intensive, and often impractical.<<
I presume you refer here to the "immune complex-like reaction" that is said
to occur among approximately 6% of persons that receive booster doses of
HDCV, because serious systemic reactions seem to be extremely rare. Quoting
from "Rabies Prevention -- United States, 1991," "An immune complex-like
reaction occurs...2-21 days after administration of the booster dose. These
patients develop a generalized urticaria, sometimes accompanied by
arthralgia, arthritis, angioedema, nausea, vomiting, fever, and malaise. In
no cases have the illnesses been life-threatening. This reaction occurs
much less frequently among persons receiving primary vaccination."
According to "Availability of New Rabies Vaccine for Human Use," "The
manufacturer [of PCEC also reported the occurrence of a substantial
anamnestic antibody response with no reports of IgE-mediated
hypersensitivity when PCEC was used as a booster, regardless of the vaccine
used for primary vaccination. As with the other available products (HDCV
and RVA), local reactions such as swelling, induration, and reddening have
been associated with administration of PCEC." Perhaps this new vaccine will
be the answer.
>>The clinical dilemma is: how to manage the person who has an exposure to
rabies, and had a documented (intramuscular) pre-exposure immunization
series four or more years earlier? Does this person require: 1) a
five-injection series of rabies vaccine, 2) a five-injection series of
rabies vaccine plus RIG, or 3) two post-exposure boosters? <<
If a person has taken a pre-exposure series of either HDCV, RVA, or PCEC,
regardless of how long ago, the recommended post-exposure regimen in the
United States is two 1.0-mL vaccine doses delivered intramuscularly,
administered on days 0 and 3. RIG is not necessary and should not be given
to a person who has had a pre-exposure vaccine series.
>>Specifically, has anyone collected data showing decays of rabies titers
after three pre-exposure injections, and is there data on post-booster
titer responses for boosters given at variable times (4-10 years) after a
pre-exposure series?<<
At the meeting "Rabies: Advancing Toward the 21st Century," (Houston,
Texas, Feb. 10, 1995) Deborah J. Briggs, Ph.D., who is Director of the
Rabies Laboratory at Kansas State University's College of Veterinary
Medicine, presented a talk entitled, "Human Vaccination and Longevity of
Immunity Against Rabies." Dr. Briggs and her group investigated the
influence that various factors had on duration of immunity following
vaccination. They looked at age, gender, route of administration
(intramuscular vs. intradermal), whether the vaccine was given pre-exposure
or post-exposure, and whether the individual was a Peace Corps volunteer
(PCV). They found that the length of time that antibody titers remained
adequate (which is considered to be 1:5 or higher by the Rabies Fluorescent
Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT)) depended only on route of administration and
whether the individual was a PCV.
In non-PCV's who were given pre-exposure vaccine intramuscularly (IM), 93%
had adequate titers 2 to 2.5 years after vaccination. In non-PCVs who had
received their vaccine series by the intradermal route (ID), only 74% still
had an adequate titer 2 to 2.5 years post-vaccination.
In PCVs, the percentages were much lower: 79% with IM vaccination and 51%
of those with ID vaccination maintained adequate titers for the same time
period. This was considered attributable to antimalarial drugs taken by
PCVs. Chloroquine and related compounds are known to interfere with
antibody response to HDCV.
Longer-term data from this study are spotty: At 3 to 3.5 years, 85% of
non-PCVs with IM vaccination still had adequate titers; by 4.5 to 5 years,
this had decreased to 73%. For non-PCVs with ID vaccination, only 49% had
immunity after 5 to 5.5 years and this had decreased to 40% after 5.5 to 6
years.
Among PCVs, 14% of those vaccinated ID maintained an adequate titer for 6
to 6.5 years.
The CDC's data are similar: "Two years after primary pre-exposure
vaccination, a 1:5 serum dilution will fail to neutralize challenge virus
completely (by RFFIT) among 2%-7% of persons who received the three-dose
pre-exposure series intramuscularly and 5%-17% of persons who received the
three-dose series intradermally."
CDC's recommendations are as follows: "Persons who work with live rabies
virus in research laboratories or vaccine production facilities (continuous
risk category; see Table 3*) are at the highest risk of [unrecognized
exposures. Such persons should have a serum sample tested for rabies
antibody every 6 months (Table 4**). Booster doses (IM or ID) of vaccine
should be given to maintain a serum titer corresponding to at least
complete neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT. The frequent
risk category includes other laboratory workers, such as those doing rabies
diagnostic testing, spelunkers, veterinarians and staff, animal-control and
wildlife officers in areas where animal rabies is epizootic, and
international travelers living or visiting (for greater than 30 days) in
areas where canine rabies is endemic. Persons among this group should have
a serum sample tested for rabies antibody every 2 years and, if the titer
is less than complete neutralization at a 1:5 serum dilution by the RFFIT,
should have a booster dose of vaccine. Alternatively, a booster can be
administered in lieu of a titer determination. Veterinarians and animal
control and wildlife officers working in areas of low rabies [incidence
among unvaccinated animals (infrequent exposure group) do not require
routine pre-exposure booster doses of HDCV or RVA after completion of
primary pre-exposure vaccination (Table 3)."
