Around 270 people in Pegu [Bago] Division have been hospitalized with foodborne illness after eating milk-noodle soup at a Buddhist coordination ceremony in the town of Thegon on Mon 21 Apr 2014.

A local resident told DVB that children were the first to suffer from stomach problems after eating the soup, which was served en masse to the novice monks and attendees as part of an alms ceremony. "The children ate first and some of them immediately fell ill," he said. "Then the adults who were eating began experiencing the symptoms of food poisoning." He added that the novices who were being ordained escaped unscathed as they declined to eat when they saw the effects on the laypersons at the gathering.

He said that those with serious conditions were transported to Thegon Public Hospital while 70 others with mild symptoms were treated at a local medical clinic in nearby Inbinhla. A villager who was hospitalized after eating the soup said, "I ate one bowl of noodles, and after about an hour and a half I felt terrible cramps in my stomach. I had to be rushed to the hospital."

More than 200 villagers from Paw Baw Kho village, in Myawaddy Township, Karen [Kayin] State were admitted to Myawaddy Hospital's intensive care unit suffering from foodborne illness. The outbreak happened after villagers ate specially prepared fragrant rice (Thingyan rice) served at the Myanmar New Year festival held at Paw Baw Kho village monastery on 19 Apr 2014.

A villager who helped the sick villagers spoke to Karen News. "Our villagers started vomiting and defecating in the evening soon after they had eaten the Thingyan rice."

She told Karen News that a stuffing made by mixing yellow beans with tamarind leaves was used in the rice. "These villagers have been in Myawaddy Hospital for 2 days already. The villagers had bought the yellow beans from the market in Thin Gan Nyi Naung, but they prepared the stuffing themselves."

The Paw Baw Kho village head medic told Karen News that half of the affected villagers were children and the elderly. The village medic said villagers had symptoms that included being [dizziness], high fevers, vomiting, and [diarrhea].

Paw Baw Kho village is a 20-minute drive from Myawaddy Town. There are over 180 [people] living in Paw Baw Kho. This is 1st first time villagers suffered food poisoning despite being involved in the tradition at the monastery every year following Burma's traditional Thingyan water festival.

[Myanmar (http://www.asterism.info/states/) consists of 14 provinces; or 7 states representing the areas of 7 main ethnic races and 7 divisions. All 7 states are more or less mountainous, whilst the divisions are mainly plain areas with the exception of Sagaing, Bago, and Thaninthayi divisions. Maps of Myanmar can be seen at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/myanmar_map2.htm and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2428195,148.

The etiologies of these 2 separate, relatively large outbreaks of foodborne illness are not clear. The Bago cluster, primarily abdominal pain and vomiting, seemed to occur quite soon after ingestion of the food vehicle suggesting a contaminating chemical or heavy metal ingestion rather than a biotoxin such as staphylococcal or _Bacillus cereus_ enterotoxin?

The 2nd cluster of cases, with fever, vomiting, and diarrhea, could be a bacterial gastroenteritis. It is not clear from the posting whether the meal of fragrant rice was at lunch or dinner to assess what the incubation period of the illness was. - Mod.LL]
