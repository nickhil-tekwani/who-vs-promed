Three West Australians, including at least 1 baby, have been treated
in hospital after an outbreak of a rare form of salmonella infection
linked to the tropical fruit paw paw. The Health Department said 11
people had been struck down with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Litchfield, an uncommon strain of the bacteria which is usually only
seen in 2 to 5 people a year.
Those infected range from babies through to an 86-year-old, including
4 young children and a 22-year-old pregnant woman. Nine of the cases
were in Perth, and 1 each in the Wheatbelt and South-West.
Authorities have not been able to trace the source of the
contaminated fruit. All paw paw sold in WA is grown locally but there
are several suppliers. Most of the people affected had eaten paw paw
which was bought already cut into pieces. While authorities have
stopped short of recalling all paw paw throughout the State, they
have warned that contaminated product might still be out in the
market-place and people should be careful when handling or eating the
fruit.
Director of communicable disease control Paul Van Buynder said
investigations had shown a significant link between illness from this
type of salmonella and eating cut paw paw. He said the department
was advising people to use food safety measures when handling the
fruit, including washing them thoroughly under running water before
eating.
After cutting paw paw at home, people should wash their hands,
cutting boards and knives.

[In the above article, pawpaw refers to the tropical fruit papaya
(_Carica papaya_). The contamination is likely to have resulted from
cutting a fruit contaminated with salmonella organisms on its
external skin, as has occurred with melons.
Of additional side interest, in the USA, Pawpaw (_Asimina_) also
known as a prairie banana, Kentucky banana, or Ozark banana, is a
genus of 8 or 9 species of small trees with large leaves and fruit,
and is native to southeastern North America. The genus includes the
largest edible fruit native to North America. However, this fruit
has no relation to the pawpaw described in the article above,
associated with the salmonella outbreak.
