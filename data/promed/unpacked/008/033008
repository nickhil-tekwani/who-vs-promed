Malaria resurgent in Thailand
---------------------------
A resurgence in malaria [and cholera] cases after almost a decade
without any major outbreaks is posing a major threat to public
health, a recent nationwide survey found. Malaria and cholera are
becoming increasingly significant problems in the South and
Northeast, according to the latest report on health conditions by the
Thai Health Promotion Foundation.

Malaria outbreaks are becoming particularly serious, especially in
the southernmost border provinces where more than 3000 people have
contracted the disease so far this year [ 2007], the report said.

Violence resulting from the separatist insurgency in the South is
thought to have contributed to the re-emergence of malaria as well as
other health problems in the troubled, predominantly rural border
region. An increasing number of residents living through the violence
there are also suffering from high blood pressure, diabetes, heart
disease and asthma, the report said.

Door-to-door visits by health workers from hospitals in Narathiwat,
Pattani and Yala have dropped by 70 percent since violence resurfaced
in the provinces in January 2004.

"It is obvious that the violence has affected the health of southern
people. If the situation remains neglected, people will die not only
from the violence but also from the diseases plaguing the area," said
Supoj Sanguankittipan, chairman of the Phuket Community Institution.

[Malaria in tourists was reported in 2006, but no new data on malaria
in the indigenous population were available indicating an increasing
risk. The increased risk is due to a breakdown in local public health
due to civil unrest, as described in this post, and a high malaria
endemicity in neighbouring Burma (Myanmar). - Mod.EP]
