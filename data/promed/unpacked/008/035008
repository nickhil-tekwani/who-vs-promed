I am a Dr. from Ecuador. I recently got acquinted with the preliminary
results of a clinical trial on cutaneous Leishmaniasis from a local research
group (Dr. Ronald Guderian from Hospital Voz Andes). This research group is
having important remission rates in the treatment of cutaneous Leishmaniasis
with MEFLOQUINE which is an antimalarial drug used for chloroquine-resistant
P. falciparum.

The cutaneous form (which is more treatable) is not as common in the dog as
the visceral form and usually reflects the fact that the animal is
immunocompromised in some way.
Regardless of the regimen used, several weeks of therapy will probably be
necessary. This will challenge the physiological constitution of a young,
healthy animal so toxic effects need to be closely monitored. In any
situation, the prognosis is guarded.

Owners and animal advocates should be made aware that these animals are
reservoirs for human infection and for the infection of currently healthy
animals.
What follows are some treatment suggestions from the Canine Associate
computer-assisted diagnosis software:
LEISHMANIASIS
Treatment Information:
1) Treatment reported effective has been ketoconazole 10 mg/kg PO q12h with
food.

2) Pentavalent antimonial compounds have been used for treating humans.
Sodium stibogluconate (Pentostam) 10-50 mg/kg IV daily for 10 days, wait 10
days and repeat treatment. Usually not curative and may cause toxicity.
3) Glucantime 100 mg/kg IM q48h X 10-15, repeat if necessary. Treatment of
choice for canine leishmaniasis in Spain. Successful therapy is dependent on
early diagnosis and continuous treatment in most cases. Complete cure is
uncommon with frequent relapses. Dogs with renal or hepatic disease have a
poor prognosis.
4) Itraconazole has been used to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans.
5) Allopurinol has also been used in humans with and without antimonial
compounds.

I am not a doctor but I have a lot of experience in this area. Your best bet
is prevention. This may sound silly but a simple application of commercial
insect repellent should dramatically decrease the incidence of infection.

[I doubt it for Calabria. The optimum method of reducing the risk of
leishmaniasis is aerial spraying to knock down and control the sandfly
population. With a 20% canine prevalence in the area I suspect there are
major socio-cultural, economic, and environmental problems. MHJ]
