---------------------------------------------------------
Although Google translates jilo as eggplant, this is wrong. Eggplant, in
Portuguese, is beringela.

Gilo (or jilo) is a green fruit related to the tomato and the eggplant; the
plant, which bears it is also called the scarlet eggplant. It was once
treated as a distinct species, _Solanum gilo_, but it is now known to be a
cultivar group of _Solanum aethiopicum_ (the Ethiopian eggplant or nakati).

Gilo was brought to the Americas from West Africa during the slave trade.
It is still grown in West Africa, where it is sometimes called "garden eggs".

Widely grown in Brazil, where it is known as jilo, it is normally cooked as
a vegetable. The fruit "turns orange-red when ripe," but is usually picked
and cooked while it is green.

Also the preparation was as a homemade preserve, not just canned cooked jilo.
