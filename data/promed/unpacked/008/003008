Orange farms under threat of canker disease
-------------------------------------------
Pakistan is lagging behind in citrus production due to canker disease, which has to be controlled quickly.

Sargodha [Punjab province] orange farms have come under threat of the disease and [to] find a remedy, the combined efforts of exporters and growers [are necessary]. The [disease], if not controlled, will badly affect orange exports in coming years. The need of the hour is to apply latest research in Sargodha.

Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Association (PFVA) and the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) [stated] that, if stakeholders joined to fight this battle, Pakistan could increase its orange exports from the current USD200 million to USD1 billion.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_). The disease originated in Asia but is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide, except Australia where an outbreak was successfully eradicated (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528). CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_, and a number of different strains (pathovars) specialise in infecting different hosts to cause bacterial blights in, for example, pomegranate and onion. CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacterium can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material, but may also include bactericidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence.

A group of strains of the related _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ originating in South America causes a similar disease in some locations, but it is much less widespread and of lower economic significance.
