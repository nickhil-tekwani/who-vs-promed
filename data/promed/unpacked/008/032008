The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has revealed the strange disease in Kano is caused by dansami food poisoning.

NAFDAC director-general, Mojisola Adeyeye, disclosed this in an interview with Channels Television on Wednesday [17 Mar 2021].

Before now, it was reported an outbreak of a strange infection had led to the death of 2 persons and the hospitalisation of 183 others in the state.

The state ministry of health confirmed the affected patients presented symptoms of haematuria (dark, bloody urine), fever, lethargy, and sometimes jaundice.

Adeyeye described the incident as "very serious", adding the investigations are still in progress.

"The Kano incident is a case of food poisoning with flavoured drinks having a chemical called dansami. It is very serious because the food poisoning resulted in diarrhoea, vomiting, and hospitalisation," she said.

"Our zonal director, Pharmacist Gimba, is on top of this and our pharmacovigilance officers are also investigating what actually happened.

"We're going to do a lot of testing in the lab to know the nature of this chemical that probably led to food poisoning.

The director-general, however, said she does not yet have details on the origin of the flavoured drinks. She said though the chances of recurrence are minimal, NAFDAC is yet to find out if it approved the manufacturing of the drink.

"But our pharmacovigilance is already there; so once we discover the cause, we'll know what next to do in terms of arresting the culprit or bringing them to the office to know what is going on," she said.

"The chances of recurrence are minimal. But we don't even know whether the flavoured drinks are smuggled. We sometimes find out that manufacturing is not approved by NAFDAC. So, we just have to find out whether this particular flavoured drink was approved by NAFDAC."

[While the flavoring of the water may be involved, and while the water may or may not be important, there seems to be a consensus that the cause of this mysterious illness is in some way related to the water or its flavoring.

However, the agent named is 'dansami.' I have not found mention of this substance anywhere on the internet, except in news releases related to this incident. I cannot find this word in toxicology books, or chemical journals, or historical journals. It may be something specific to local culture, but I am unable to make the determination of what kind of product, chemical, or natural substance this is. Any information from knowledgeable source in the area will be appreciated. - Mod.TG
