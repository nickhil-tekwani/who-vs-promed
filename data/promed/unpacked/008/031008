The Secretariat of Health of Rio Grande do Sul confirmed [but see
later in this paragraph - Mod.JW] this Wed 7 Jan 2009 the 1st death
from yellow fever [YF] in the state since 1966. The victim was a
housewife 31 years of age of Santo Angelo in the region of Missiones,
Argentina. Another occurrence, recorded in Santa Casa de Misericordia
in Porto Alegre, is suspected to be YF.

Samples sent to the Adolfo Lutz Institute of Sao Paulo, Brazil should
confirm whether the death was caused by the disease [This is unclear.
We suppose it means that a resident of a frontier town in Argentina
was hospitalized in Brazil in the state of Grande do Sul and died
there. - Mod.JW].

Concerned about the situation, the Secretary of Health put 13 more
municipalities within the area of risk for the transmission of yellow
fever [virus], adding them to the 87 that were already in that
category since the beginning of December 2008, all cities in the west
and central regions of the state, including some medium-sized cities
such as Santo Angelo, Ijui, Santa Rosa and Cruz Alta.

The population of these municipalities, estimated at 500 000 people,
is being vaccinated in mass by the Secretariat of Health. Those going
to the areas of risk should also get immunized 10 days in advance of travel.

"Unlike dengue, there is a vaccine to prevent disease," stressed the
Secretary for Health, Osmar Terra, with the warning that yellow fever
is even more serious [than dengue] and can kill 50 percent of those infected.

A key indicator that the yellow fever virus reached the west of Rio
Grande do Sul is the recent death of 311 monkeys in various
locations. The health officials usually monitor the population of
animals that live in riparian forests in the state. When there are
deaths [in monkeys] that lead to suspicion of the disease [YF virus
infection], laboratory tests are done. The last time that the yellow
fever [virus] had been detected in the region was in 2001, when it
did not infect humans.

The absence of mosquitoes prevents transmission of the disease in
cities. Humans can get infected when they enter the forest without
being vaccinated and are bitten by a mosquito [transmitting the
virus]. That is what happened to the owner of the home in Santo
Angelo, who traveled through rural areas in Eugenio Castro, the
neighboring area. He developed symptoms on 18 Dec 2008 and died on 25
Dec 2008. And that is also what could have possibly happened to a
resident of Nova Santa Rita, in the municipality of Porto Alegre, who
traveled to Pirapo, northwest of the city, where monkeys had been
found dead, and when he returned began to feel the symptoms of YF
virus infection, which led to his death the night of Tue 6 Jan 2009.

[This case is part of the outbreak in Argentina, which is contiguous
to this one. In 1966, there was an outbreak of sylvan (jungle) yellow
fever that affected southern Brazil. To paraphrase Camus: The yellow
fever virus does not disappear, it is only dormant for a while. A
similar phrase was written by Albert Camus in his novel "The Plague."
Nature should be read and understood, never underestimated (this
sentence is mine). - Mod.LJS]

[This is an illustration that infectious disease outbreaks do not
respect political boundaries, emphasizing the need to focus
surveillance on ecosystem areas rather than international limits.
This underscores the need to share timely information
internationally. The report does not indicate whether there are
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes (the YF virus urban transmission cycle
vector) in houses and other buildings of the area where these 2 cases
resided. Nor is there mention of the species of monkeys dying of YF
virus infection in this sylvan outbreak, but black howler monkeys
(_Alouatta caraya_) are likely to be involved.
