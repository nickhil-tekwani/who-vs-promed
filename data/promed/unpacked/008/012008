Russian Hunters to Help Contain Advancing Bird Flu
--------------------------------------------------
Some Russian regions have opened the hunting season early in an attempt to
stop the spread of a deadly outbreak of bird flu, the Reuters news agency
reported on Thursday [18 Aug 2005].
In the regions of Irkutsk, in eastern Siberia, and Penza, in European
Russia, local officials decided to open the hunting season for birds early,
even though there have been no cases of bird flu in those regions,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
Russia is trying to contain an outbreak of bird flu, which has spread
across Siberia to the Ural Mountains, the geographic divide between Asia
and Europe.
Veterinary officials fear migrating birds could spread the virus to the
agricultural regions of southern Russia as the birds fly to winter in
Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East.
The outbreak was discovered in mid-July 2005 in Novosibirsk and has spread
through Tyumen, Omsk, Kurgan, Altai and Chelyabinsk, while bird deaths have
been reported in Kalmykia, a region in southern Russia.
But those deaths were not due to bird flu, according to preliminary tests,
Interfax news agency reported, citing local officials from the state's
consumer rights watchdog.
The H5N1 subtype of bird flu has killed more than 50 people in Asia since
2003. No cases among humans have been confirmed in Russia.

Bird flu has been confirmed in 40 Russian settlements and suspected in
another 78, the Agriculture Ministry's press service said citing the
Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Infection on Friday [19
Aug 2005].
In the Altai territory, the dangerous infection was confirmed in one
hitherto suspected village. As of 19 Aug 2005, bird flu was detected and
confirmed by laboratory tests in 8 settlements located in 5 districts,
PRIME-TASS said. Laboratory tests are being carried out for another 8
settlements in 8 Altai districts.
In the Tyumen region, veterinary services culled all the poultry in the
settlements hit by bird flu.
In the Omsk region, bird flu was confirmed in 6 suspected settlements,
including 2 populated areas and on 4 lakes among waterfowl. Culling is
underway in the affected areas. Results of bird flu tests are due in 32
Omsk region settlements.
In the Kurgan region, bird flu was confirmed in 6 settlements, and
suspected in another 13.
In the Chelyabinsk region, 3 settlements with an adverse bird flu situation
were reported. One village is a suspected bird flu contact. The affected
settlements were quarantined.
The Novosibirsk region confirmed bird flu in 15 settlements and suspects
the infection in another 25. As of now, local veterinary services have
culled 70 000 poultry in 11 affected settlements.

[Both news items highlight the urgent need for a new official follow-up
report on the situation in western Siberia. The previous update was sent to
the OIE on 5 Aug 2005. The report is expected to clarify the actual number
and the locations of the accumulated outbreaks, the species involved, the
results of laboratory investigations, and the control measures applied. In
the absence of such an update, there is room for eyebrow-raising rumors,
such as the one on hunters allegedly supposed to stop the spread of avian
influenza by shooting migrating birds. - Mod.AS]
