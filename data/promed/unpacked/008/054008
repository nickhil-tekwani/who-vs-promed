You highlighted the JAVMA News lead poisoning article on ProMED [Lead poisoning - USA: (NY) cattle, human 20190927.6696894] 27 Sep 2019. The article was based on an hour-long presentation at the AVMA Convention in August 2019. The presentation itself was based on a handful of published papers and about 15 years of diagnostic samples analyzed at the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory. As you might imagine, the news article was somewhat abbreviated and simplified. Additional information (not directly from the presentation) was also added by the AVMA news author.

Concerning your questions, the sizes of the herds ranged from 4 to 22 beef cows and 24 to 150 dairy cows. Herds were located in multiple US states, including New York. The dairy we followed for more than 2 years had about 100 cows. The lead concentration in the bulk tank (which is where milk collected from all of the cows is stored) was about 0.1 mg/L in the 1st sample collected. Milk from individual cows varied, but in some it was 5-fold higher. The primary income from the farm was from the valuable genetics and embryo transfer; thus, while inability to sell all of the milk was a hardship, the herd was sustainable throughout the study period. As you are aware, in the dairy industry, bulk tank milk from multiple farms is normally combined and processed for retail sale. However, another serious case of lead contamination happened in a very small dairy owned by a community where the children's milk came directly from those cows, a situation that concerned me greatly. In this case, the source of lead was an old painted plank that had been used to replace a broken chute from the hopper that mixed feed.

One of the beef herds mentioned, in which the farmers were also exposed to environmental lead, was on small hobby farm and historic country home. There was lead paint in the house and the cattle barn. They lost several cows and calves, but the story has a happy ending: The child who was in utero at the time of our field investigation has grown into a brilliant girl and, when I talked with her a few years ago, she had graduated from junior high school with honors.

One of the most important things I've learned over the years, something not highlighted in this article, is many of the individual cattle exposed to lead do not have any clinical signs, despite some of them having remarkably elevated blood lead concentrations. Out of 94 cattle with detectable blood lead concentrations, only 11 had any clinical signs attributable to lead exposure. These silent exposures are particularly concerning to me, and the reason we generally recommend when lead poisoning is diagnosed in any of the animals on a farm, all potentially exposed animals should be tested before they become part of the human food chain.

Best wishes, and thank you for your consideration.
