[This report increases the number of yellow fever cases reported by ProMED-mail from 2 to 31. The Ministry of Health's Epidemiological Bulletin is available only through week 46 (10-16 Nov 2013). It would be of interest to know if any further yellow fever (YF) cases have occurred since then. These cases occurred in the Peruvian Amazon basin, where YF virus is endemic. All people living in this region are at risk of yellow fever virus infection transmitted from non-human primates to humans by forest mosquitoes and thus should be vaccinated. Since there are _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes that are efficient YF virus vectors present in the general lowlands of the eastern Peru area abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses, there is risk of spill-over of the sylvan transmission cycle into the urban one. That makes YF vaccination of people living in these areas an important preventive measure.

A map showing the location of the Peru regions mentioned above can be accessed at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/peru_admin_06.jpg, and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map is available at http://healthmap.org/r/1z-z. - Mod.TY]
