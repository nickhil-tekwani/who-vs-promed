Congo fever has killed seven in state: Govt
-------------------------------
Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) has claimed 7 lives in Gujarat. And according to the state government, about 18 people have been affected by CCHF.

Replying to a question from Vadodara City MLA [Member of the Legislative Assembly] Bhupendra Lakhawala, the government said that after an incubation period of one to 3 days following a tick bite, flu-like symptoms appear, which may resolve in a week. In up to 75 per cent of cases, however, signs of haemorrhage appear 3 to 5 days after the onset of the illness if it is not contained [treated?] properly. Officials said that symptoms characterising the initial stage of CCHF include mood instability, agitation, and mental confusion. Other signs are nosebleed, bloody urine vomiting, and black stools.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral haemorrhagic fever caused by a nairovirus. Although primarily a zoonosis, sporadic cases and outbreaks of CCHF affecting humans occur. The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia. This preceding government statement is further confirmation that Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus is present (and probably endemic) in northern India.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness. When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a risk of nosocomial spread of infection.

CCHF virus may infect a wide range of domestic and wild animals. Animals become infected with CCHF from the bite of infected ticks. A number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, but the most efficient and common vectors for CCHF appear to be members of the genus _Hyalomma _. Trans-ovarial (transmission of the virus from infected female ticks to offspring via eggs) and venereal transmission have been demonstrated amongst some vector species, indicating one mechanism which may contribute to maintaining the circulation of the virus in nature. However, the most important source for acquisition of the virus by ticks is believed to be infected small vertebrates on which immature _Hyalomma_ ticks feed. Once infected, the tick remains infected through its developmental stages, and the mature tick may transmit the infection to large vertebrates, such as livestock. Domestic ruminant animals, such as cattle, sheep and goats, are viraemic for around one week after becoming infected.

Disease management in humans consists of general supportive therapy. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component replacement is required. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used in treatment of established CCHF infection with some apparent benefit. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective. There is no protective vaccine. (For further information, see: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs208/en/index.html).
