National disaster looms
-----------------------
Two viral crop diseases -- the cassava mosaic disease (CMD) and brown streak disease (CBSD) -- have decimated virtually entire harvests in the Lake zone regions [Geita, Kagera, Mara, Mwanza, Shinyanga, and Simiyu regions] destroying an estimated 90 percent of the crop last year [2013].

Many farmers now don't have food and income. They said that short of deliberate and concerted measures, the nation faces an emergency yet unprecedented in the history of the Lake zone where severe hunger looms large. Scientists are visiting the farmers across the Lake zone to assess the effects caused by the diseases.

As farmers in Mara region count their losses, the 2 diseases haven't spared neighbouring Mwanza.

A former secretary of [a village] cassava growing group identifies the cost of distributing plantlets [of improved varieties] to the farmers as one of the biggest challenges. Regional commissioners have described the diseases as a threat that could "erase" cassava from the Lake zone.

Dr Joseph Ndunguru, Mikocheni Agriculture Research Institute (MARI), says surveys had identified "many strains" of disease. He urged farmers to take precautions by selecting 'clean' planting materials to curb the spread of the diseases.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease can be caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ (CBSV; genus _Ipomovirus_) and the more recently identified _Ugandan cassava brown streak virus_. It is considered a threat to the whole of sub-Saharan Africa, where the crop is a major factor in food security. Symptoms may include leaf chlorosis, stem necrosis, and yellow/brown, corky necrosis in the starch-bearing tissue of roots. Leaves may appear healthy even when the roots have rotted away. Total crop losses of 20-80 percent have been reported, and losses in individual root weight of up to 70 percent have been observed in susceptible cultivars.

Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) has triggered food emergencies in the past by destroying cassava crops throughout whole regions. Symptoms include leaf mosaic, distortion, and stunting of plants leading to severe reduction of tuber yields. CMD is caused by a number of species and strains in the genus _Begomovirus_ which seem to be associated with it in different areas. At least one of them (_African cassava mosaic virus_; ACMV) has also been found in an alternative host (soybean) suggesting that these viruses may have a wider host reservoir and may pose a threat to other crops as well. Co-infections as well as genetic recombination between strains have also been reported, and recombinant strains can be particularly virulent.

Both CBSV and the CMD viruses are spread with infected plant material (including seed tubers). Both also have whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes) which are also a serious pest in their own right. Disease management usually relies on control of vectors as well as pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants, but these methods have proven unsatisfactory in developing countries. Certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures) is essential, but, as mentioned above, distribution to farmers is often difficult.

Crop varieties resistant to different CMD strains are being developed for local use. In Africa, this has alleviated the problem in some areas, but in others, the new varieties are being wiped out by brown streak. A new CBSV strain adapted to higher altitudes has emerged recently and is affecting additional CMD resistant cultivars (ProMED-mail posts 20100525.1735 and 20120706.1191742). A westward spread of the viruses is being observed in Africa.

The joint management of both diseases has become a major challenge for cassava production worldwide (ProMED-mail post 20110829.2643) since development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult (ProMED-mail post 20090709.2463). The different viruses can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains, and different crop varieties are likely to be needed geared towards local viral populations.
