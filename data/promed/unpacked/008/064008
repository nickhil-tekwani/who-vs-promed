An elderly woman has died and there are fears thousands of others may be at risk following a _Listeria_ outbreak. A caller tipped off the Neil Mitchell program about the outbreak at the Dandenong South commercial food caterer, I Cook Foods, which was later confirmed by the Department of Health and Human Services.

The business has been shut down while health authorities investigate. "They have tracked it to facility, which provides meals on wheels," Heidi Murphy explained." They have closed the facility until they are satisfied it is safe."

The potentially deadly contamination made headlines last year [2018] after being linked to rockmelon nationwide.

A woman has died and thousands of people are at risk of _Listeria_ infection after the bacteria was detected in food from a southeast Melbourne catering company that supplies food to hospitals, aged care homes and Meals on Wheels.

The catering service "I Cook Foods" has been shut down after the woman, who was in her 80s and from the eastern suburbs, died in Knox Private Hospital on 4 Feb 2019. The woman contracted a listeria-related illness while in hospital after being admitted for an unrelated condition in late January [2019], a health department spokesman said.

A total of 6 positive samples of _Listeria_ were found at the company's Dandenong South kitchen during an investigation into the cause of the woman's death over the past 2 weeks. The I Cook Foods kitchen provides meals to patients at private hospitals including St Vincent's, Frankston and Knox, as well as Mercy aged-care homes and many Meals on Wheels providers across the state [Victoria, Australia].

Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said the potentially contaminated food was in circulation until Thursday night [21 Feb 2019?], meaning people may have been eating the food on Friday [22 Feb 2019?] morning. "People who might've eaten it [on Thursday] or in recent weeks might still develop illness," Dr Sutton said. "Potentially thousands of people have been exposed. I don't want to see any more [deaths]." People who may have eaten the food have been urged to be alert for early flulike signs of the bacteria, which can cause blood poisoning and meningitis.

St Vincent's confirmed the "potential receipt of listeria-contaminated food from a catering provider," saying an alternative food source had been organised. In a statement, St Vincent's said its hospitals at Kew and East Melbourne had discarded all potentially contaminated food, and had started compiling a list of patients who had eaten the food between 13 Jan and 21 Feb [2019]. The hospital said it would begin contacting all patients immediately, prioritising elderly persons, noting the "potential delay in _Listeria_ symptom development."

Melbourne Private, Knox Private, Frankston Private, Holmesglen and North Park private hospitals have also been affected. All the hospitals are run by Healthscope, which confirmed on Friday [22 Feb 2019] afternoon that aged care facilities at Ivanhoe and Clayton South had also been hit.

All affected sites have been ordered to throw out remaining food from "I Cook Foods." Dr. Sutton said health authorities were taking no risks in ensuring the potential outbreak was contained. "We're taking an abundance of precaution ... this was a production facility for so many vulnerable people," he said. Healthscope said all food deliveries from "I Cook Foods" had been thrown out and any patients who may have eaten a contaminated meal were being contacted. Acting chief health officer Brett Sutton says one-third of people who are infected can die of [listeriosis] and the elderly or pregnant women are at risk.

Dr. Sutton said the health department was taking all necessary steps to ensure "I Cook Foods" passed all tests before reopening. He said this could take weeks. Dr. Sutton was reluctant to lay blame at the feet of "I Cook Foods," saying an investigation was underway to determine exactly which part of the food-handling process was at fault for spreading the bacteria. He said potential compensation for relatives of the woman would be a matter for the caterer, adding the family was being supported by authorities in the wake of the tragic incident.

[Listeriosis's] gestation period is about 2 weeks [actually, listeriosis has a long incubation period of up to 70 days. - Mod.ML], according to health authorities, meaning those who have eaten the supplier's food in the past fortnight are particularly at risk. Dr. Sutton said the bacteria was usually found in foods such as soft cheeses, sliced meats and fruits.

The department has started alerting other catering companies that their food may be contaminated. Yarra Ranges Council told The Age it had contacted about 100 people who received Meals on Wheels supplied by "I Cook Foods" and told them to throw out the meals. Knox City Council said it had begun assisting Meals on Wheels customers with disposing of any food received since 13 Jan [2019], providing _Listeria_ fact sheets detailing symptoms.

Though Mercy Place Rosebud was supplied with contaminated meals, none of the residents have fallen ill. "No one's sick and all we had to do was get rid of the food," a spokesperson for the aged care provider said. "We would have known in a few hours if they'd had _Listeria_ so luckily it's all under control here. They'll just have a new menu for a few days while we find an alternative."

I Cook Foods did not respond to requests for comment.

_Listeria_ is rare, but it can be extremely dangerous -- particularly to pregnant women and the elderly. Symptoms include fever, tiredness, aches and pains and headaches, but the infection can become life-threatening if not treated appropriately. Last year [2018] 6 people died and one woman miscarried after a [listeriosis] outbreak linked with rockmelon grown in NSW. There have been 2 cases of listeriosis in Victoria this year [2019] compared with 2 in the same period last year [2018], with 27 in total during 2018.

"I Cook Foods" provides meals to the following organizations:
MEALS ON WHEELS -- City of Ballarat, City of Booroondara, City of Whitehorse, Glen Eira Council, Kingston Council, Knox City Council, Monash Council, Yarra Ranges Council.
HOSPITALS -- Frankston Private, Holmesglen Private, Knox Private, Melbourne Private, Northbank Private, St Vincent's East Melbourne, St Vincent's Kew.
AGED CARE HOMES -- Fairway Hostel Aged Care Sandringham, Healthscope Independent Living Moorabbin, Mercy Health Ballarat, Mercy Health Rosebud, Yallambee Aged Care Traralgon.

[The news reports above report the death of an elderly woman with listeriosis after hospitalization in late January 2019 for an unrelated condition. Listeriosis in this patient has been linked to the commercial food caterer "I Cook Foods" in the town of Dandenong South (Australia), which supplies prepared food to multiple hospitals and other institutions caring for the elderly and "meals on wheels" in the Melbourne area.

The "I Cook Foods" website says that it produces foods that have its texture modified to varying degrees (soft, minced, pureed), although its appearance is made to conform to its original form, e.g., "broccoli looks like a floret of broccoli, carrots look like carrot batons and roast potatoes look like slices of roast potatoes," to enhance visual appeal for people with dysphagia (https://www.icookfoods.com.au/texture-modified-foods).

Ready-to-eat products that do not require further cooking before eating, such as smoked salmon or cold-cut meats (e.g., ham), are recognized as potential sources for listeriosis. Unpasteurized milk and cheese and other milk products made from unpasteurized milk are other frequent sources of listeriosis. However, the source in some outbreaks has been food contaminated with _Listeria_ only after cooking or pasteurization.

In all, 6 positive samples of _Listeria_ were found at the company's Dandenong South kitchen during an investigation, but no information is given on types of food that may have been implicated, although all food items produced by "I Cook Foods" have been recalled. Genotyping the environmental isolates and the isolate from the patient will confirm the association, if the genotypes match.

Dandenong South, with a population of 160 residents, is an industrialized suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 31 km (19 miles) southeast of Melbourne's central business district. Its local government area is the City of Greater Dandenong (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandenong_South,_Victoria).
