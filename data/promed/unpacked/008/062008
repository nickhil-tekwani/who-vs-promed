This year [2015], 142 people came down with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS] in Mordovia, but doctors warn that the peak incidence is still ahead
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The diagnosis of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome was made for a woman when she was hospitalized to the Republic Infectious Diseases Hospital. The woman got there just 3 days after she came down with a fever. At first she tried to manage the disease at home; however, when the fever reached 40 C [104 F], she called for an ambulance. She said that she was picking berries all summer. The virus can be picked up wherever wood and house mice, voles and rats leave their excreta. The disease usually manifests itself suddenly, often 2-4 weeks after infection is acquired.

"The disease usually begins acutely, with a high temperature, so any increase in temperature without any cold symptoms such as a runny nose or sore throat, should alert the person. Particularly, if in addition to fever, the person has symptoms such as a severe headache, back pain, decreased amount of urine and blurred vision," warns the head of the infectious diseases unit of the Adult Republic Infectious Hospital, Elena Batsina. The diagnosis is made based on the results of the serology test from the virology laboratory.

The last outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Mordovia took place last year [2014]. Epidemiologists recorded 365 cases of HFRS in 2014. For 7 months of this year [2015], epidemiologists registered 142 cases. The most dangerous times, according to epidemiologists, are summer and winter seasons.

To prevent development of infection, it is important to practice good personal hygiene: wear gloves and use a mask during work in garages or gardens and, of course, protect the house from rodents [entering or becoming established].

[HFRS is still on the rise in Mordovia. The reason may be related to the fact that people like to spend the summer season in suburbs and forested areas. Due to the heat, rodents also multiply [more] and that contributed to epizootiology of HFRS. At the same time, rodents often contaminate berries with their secretions. Their secretions also can be disseminated and [the virus can] persist in the dust in suburban houses and barns. - Corr.VM]

[The hantavirus responsible for this case of HFRS is not mentioned. Puumala or Dobrava viruses are likely candidates. As noted by Mod.CP in an earlier post (ProMED-mail archive no. 20150329.3263902), "Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses caused by hantaviruses -- family _Bunyaviridae_ [see http://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hfrs/]. HFRS includes diseases such as Korean hemorrhagic fever, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, and nephropathis epidemica. The viruses that cause HFRS include Hantaan, Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala. HFRS occurs throughout the world. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and western Russia. Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide. Saaremaa is found in central Europe and Scandinavia.

"Hantaviruses are carried and transmitted by rodents. People can become infected with these viruses and develop HFRS after exposure to aerosolized urine, droppings, or saliva of infected rodents or after exposure to dust from their nests. Transmission may also occur when infected urine or these other materials are directly introduced into broken skin or onto the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. In addition, individuals who work with live rodents can be exposed to hantaviruses through bites from infected rodents. Transmission from one human to another can occur, but is extremely rare.

"Rodents are the natural reservoir for hantaviruses. Known carriers include the striped field mouse (_Apodemus agrarius_), the reservoir for both the Saaremaa and Hantaan virus; the brown or Norway rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the reservoir for Seoul virus; the bank vole (_Myoides glareolus_), the reservoir for _Puumala virus_; and the yellow-necked field mouse (_Apodemus flavicollis_), which carries Dobrava virus.

"Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms, while Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate. Complete recovery can take weeks or months.

"Supportive therapy is the mainstay of care for patients with hantavirus infections. Care includes careful management of the patient's fluid (hydration) and electrolyte (such as, sodium, potassium, chloride) levels, maintenance of correct oxygen and blood pressure levels, and appropriate treatment of any secondary infections. Dialysis may be required to correct severe fluid overload. Intravenous ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been shown to decrease illness and death associated with HFRS if used very early in the disease.

"Depending upon which virus is causing the HFRS, death occurs in less than 1 percent to as many as 15 percent of patients. Fatality ranges from 5-15 percent for HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, and it is less than 1 percent for disease caused by Puumala virus. - Mod.CP"
