Fear has gripped a village in Bomet County after 18 villagers were rushed to hospital after a suspected anthrax outbreak.

Four of the victims from Kapkures village in Emitiot Sub-Location, Sotik Sub-County, were on Sunday [2 Feb 2020] morning rushed to Kapkatet Sub-County Hospital in the neighbouring Kericho County where they were treated.

"The villagers were brought to the hospital in the morning and are currently undergoing treatment and observation," said a doctor at the Kapkatet hospital.

Eleven others were taken to Longisa County Referral Hospital for treatment, with fear of the numbers rising as a result of unreported cases.

At least 3 others are said to have sought treatment at private hospitals.

[Bomet County has not been high in our list of outbreaks. The last report from there was in 2014: 3 Sep 2014, Anthrax - Kenya (06): (BO) human, bovine 20140903.2746572.

We get few reports of anthrax from Kenya from February through April. Taken with the increase overall in Kenyan reports in the past 3 years, we can ascribe it probably to greater awareness and reporting of suspected cases by villages and medical services. It is a probable measure of the success of their surveillance and control programme.

The information provided is very limited but appears to indicate cutaneous anthrax lesions from handling contaminated meat, and not (yet) gastroenteric cases.

Bomet is in the Rift Valley province, where we have been seeing livestock and wildlife outbreaks. For a map of Kenya, see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/kenya_pol88.jpg. Bomet is in the very middle of Rift Valley Province: see at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/KE/08/Bomet.html. - Mod.MHJ
