Re: In response to the ProMED posting on Japanese encephalitis (JE)
vaccine in India
-----------------------------------------------
I am very concerned after reading this. This most recent posting is
actually filled with multiple mistakes and misinformation. The number
of deaths from last year's [2005] outbreak in India was 1800 not 800.
The government imported 13.5 million doses of vaccine not 135 000.
As part of the immunization program in India (as in all countries),
adverse events following immunization (AEFI) are reported on any
event following a vaccine dose, whether it is believed related to the
vaccine or not. National regulatory authorities and the WHO have
guidelines available on this that outline the reporting. A great deal
of confusion is created for those who are not familiar with the
program and how it is organized, because the label implies
relatedness. After an event occurs, it is reviewed by a health care
provider to determine whether it is possibly related to the vaccine.
If an event is believed to be related, it is investigated by a team.
India has a system like this, and all serious adverse events have
been recorded and are being investigated. To this date, I am not
aware of any serious events that have been related to the vaccine. Of
course, the final investigation and report would need to come from
the Government of India. They have committees set up to conduct these
investigations currently.
One important thing to keep in mind is that this is not a clinical
trial with a few hundred subjects. Over 7 million children were
vaccinated in UP alone in some of the poorest regions of India. These
children, I am sad to say, have multiple challenges with infectious
diseases. The immunization is only addressing one of the multiple
challenges. Deaths from diarrhea, meningitis, and pneumonia, as
examples, would be expected to continue in this population.
A comment on the vaccine licensure and use: it is important to
remember that this is not a new vaccine. Although it is new to India,
there is a combined safety data set on studies over the last 20 years
from 3 countries, including over one million children, that has not
identified any serious adverse events related to the vaccine. This is
how India was able to move forward quickly. If this was a new
product, this forward movement would not have been possible (or
appropriate). The government is actually doing several studies in
parallel with the introduction, with active follow up for confirming
all of the safety data seen in the other studies as well as
immunogenicity to confirm successful seroconversion in Indian
children. This plan has been thoroughly thought through, and I think
the government should be applauded for its decisive action. I think
that critics and skeptics should be sure they have the appropriate
information before they judge. It is important to evaluate and review
to ensure that programs are effective and safe. Healthy and balanced
dialogue should be encouraged, but remember that inaction is also an
action with consequences. India has suffered JE outbreaks for over 30
years. The decision to move forward and solve this problem is based
on that experience.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I look forward to further
information from the Government of India.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Jacobson for her comments and
additional background information. When ProMED-mail posts information
obtained from the lay press, we are aware of the possibility of
incorrect information contained in the newswires and, therefore,
frequently present these postings as "Requests for Information" (RFI)
in the hopes that knowledgeable individuals from either the Ministry
of Health or other international technical partners will provide
ProMED-mail (and our subscribers) with sound technical information.
In the original posting in this thread, we did request further
information on investigations into the alleged reactions associated
with receipt of the vaccine, speculating that it is possible that
some of these cases might in fact be cases of actual Japanese
encephalitis infection, in which children who were vaccinated were
already infected with the JE virus and were in the incubation period
for the disease at the time they received the vaccine. We did cite
background information (from several sources including the PATH
website) on the live attenuated vaccine in use in India, citing
figures that over 200 million doses of the vaccine have been
administered without serious side effects being reported.
Like Dr. Jacobson, we are awaiting more information from the
Government of India. - Mod.MPP]
