Another 300 or so dead pigs were retrieved from a creek in Songjiang District yesterday morning [10 Mar 2013], making the total number of dead pigs removed from the creek more than 1200 since last Friday.

The Songjiang District government said it has strengthened patrols on Hengliaojing Creek upstream in Zhejiang Province and found many floating carcasses. The district doubled the number of boats removing carcasses.

Ear tags on the dead pigs could not be made out, but the Songjiang agricultural authorities said the dead pigs were likely from Pinghu in Zhejiang Province's Jiaxing City and some places in Jiangsu Province.

Shanghai collects dead pigs from farmers for biological treatment, and farmers can receive some compensation for the loss. There is no such mechanism in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. The pig farmers there simply discard dead pigs in rivers, according to Jiaxing Daily.

Zhulin Village, which has the largest pig breeding program in Zhejiang Province, experienced many swine deaths this year [2013]. More than 10 000 pigs died in January 2013, over 8000 in February 2013, and more than 300 every day this month [March 2013]. It was not known whether the dead pigs came from the village, the newspaper said.

The Songjiang Environmental Protection Bureau has started frequent checks on water quality since Friday [8 Mar 2013]. No water pollution has been detected.

[Available information on the possible (or finally established) etiology of the described mass mortality of pigs in the 2 provinces is requested. During recent years, such events were mainly attributed to the infectious diseases FMD and PRRS. Other infectious diseases, such as classical swine fever, African swine fever and influenza deserve to be considered as well. In addition, potential non-infectious etiologies deserve to be addressed (e.g. intoxication).

One of the possible causes driving farmers to get rid of dead animals is their wish to avoid their farms being quarantined if an infectious agent is discovered on their premises by the authorities. - Mod.AS]
