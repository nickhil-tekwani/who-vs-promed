Light leaf spot top oilseed rape disease
----------------------------------------
Light leaf spot has overtaken phoma as the number one disease in oilseed rape, halving yields where disease pressure is severe.

The reason why it has overtaken phoma is that recent seasons have favoured its development and many popular varieties have relatively poor natural resistance to the pathogen. Another key change is that it is no longer just a disease affecting the north and Scotland, being as prevalent in oilseed rape crops in the south.

Julie Smith, ADAS [independent provider of agricultural and environmental consultancy, rural development services, and policy advice], highlights that during the past 3 seasons, CropMonitor survey has detected light leaf spot in more than 85 per cent of English oilseed rape crops. The average over the past decade is just 54 per cent.

There are fungicides to control the disease, but the difficulty comes in identifying its symptoms and recognising it as a risk. This is because lesion on leaves can be mistaken for fertiliser scorch or herbicide damage and are difficult to see on wet leaves.

[Light leaf spot (LLS) of _Brassica_ species is caused by the fungus _Pyrenopeziza brassicae_. In oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_), leaves become infected soon after sowing, but remain symptomless until lesions appear on older leaves. In severe cases, developing leaves and buds can be affected causing leaf distortion and stunting of plants. Stems may split and break off. Developing pods are often infected, leading to premature ripening of seed and pod shatter.

LLS is polycyclic and survives the summer on crop debris, volunteer oilseed rape and vegetable brassicas. Spores are spread by wind, rain splash and with infected plant material. Disease management may include varieties with decreased levels of susceptibility, removal of infected stubble, disease monitoring and timely fungicide applications.

In the UK, LLS has caused considerable yield losses of oilseed rape in the past estimated at GBP 40 million (about USD 60 million) per year.

Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker or leaf spot) is caused by the fungus _Leptosphaeria maculans_ with a possible yield loss of 50 per cent or more. It can also affect other species in the _Brassicaceae_ family, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. For more information see link below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
