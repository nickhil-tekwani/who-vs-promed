[1] US (NY): vaccine effectiveness
Date: Mon 11 Oct 2021
Source: NBC New York [edited]
https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/delta-human-behavior-more-to-blame-for-lower-covid-vaccine-efficacy-than-waning-immunity-ny/3316430/


What to Know:
- New York State's Department of Health released on [Mon 11 Oct 2021] what it bills as the largest U.S. study by vaccine type and timing of vaccination conducted to date; it looks at nearly 9 million adult NYers.
- Ultimately, researchers found modest declines in vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough infections may have been more driven by the delta variant and changes in behavior than immunological waning.
- Researchers say that supports booster dosing recommendations by state health officials and the CDC; effectiveness of all 3 vaccines against breakthrough hospitalizations stayed high across the board.

Changes in human behavior around masking and other COVID protocol plus the rapid pace at which the highly contagious delta variant spread this summer may have had more to do with vaccine efficacy declines than immunological waning, according to a New York State Department of Health study out on [Mon 11 Oct 2021].

The preprint, non-peer-reviewed study finds all 3 federally emergency-use authorized vaccines continue to show strong effectiveness against reinfection and even greater success preventing severe breakthrough cases, with modest declines limited to Pfizer and Moderna recipients age 65 years and up, which supports targeted booster dosing recommendations, the department found.

In what outgoing New York State Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker bills as the largest U.S. study by vaccine type and timing of vaccination conducted to date, researchers assessed nearly 9 million adult New Yorkers for potential vaccine effectiveness changes by age, product and month of vaccination.

They looked at people vaccinated in January through April 2021 and examined their levels of new diagnosed infections and hospitalizations from May -- August 2021, compared to people who never received a single dose of any of the 3 vaccines.

Among the topline findings:
- Declines in vaccine effectiveness against lab-confirmed COVID infections were greatest for Pfizer-BioNTech recipients (-24.6% for those aged 18-49, -19.1% for those 50-64 and -14.1% for 65+) compared with Moderna (-18% vaccine effectiveness decline for 18-49, -11.6% for 50-64 and -9%) and Johnson & Johnson recipients (-19.2% for 18-49, -10.8% for 50-64 and -10.9% for 65+).

- Those declines happened simultaneously across age, vaccine type and timing groups during the weeks when the prevalence of the delta strain in New York and the country grew most rapidly; Pfizer recipients saw the greatest declines of the 3 vaccine types during that period.

- Once delta topped 85% prevalence among all New York COVID strains, those variances plateaued. More recently vaccinated people were found to have higher protection levels in some groups, while modest continued declines were seen for the senior population, suggesting that particular variant and less intense personal prevention behavior heavily contributed to effectiveness declines.

- Vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization for adults age 18-64 held at 86%-plus across ages with no trend over time; among those 65+, effectiveness declined from May to August [2021] for Pfizer (95% to 89.2%) and Moderna (97.2% to 94.1%) recipients. J&J recipients saw lower effectiveness overall, ranging from 85.5%-82.8% with no differential related to the time period studied.

Lead study author Dr. Eli Rosenberg of the Department of Health said the research supports the need for vaccine booster doses among older people in particular. He noted that while there was evidence of early vaccine effectiveness declines against reinfection for younger people, that leveled off once delta established dominance.

"Together, this suggests that ongoing waning protection may be less of a current concern for adults younger than 65 years," Rosenberg said.

New York state debuted its first public COVID breakthrough and variant trackers late last month. As of the latest update, the state has reported 95 146 lab-confirmed breakthrough COVID cases, which represents just 0.8% of the fully vaccinated eligible population. It has reported 6567 breakthrough hospitalizations among that eligible population (0.06%) as of [3 Oct 2021] as well.

The state's dashboards support researchers' contention in this latest study that vaccine effectiveness did decline in terms of breakthrough infections through at least mid-July [2021] but then ebbed. Vaccine effectiveness against breakthrough hospitalizations remained consistently strong in the face of the delta variant.

That variant accounted for 99.8% of all confirmed COVID cases sequenced in New York during the latest 2-week period of study [12 to 25 Sep 2021], up from 99.5% in the previous 2-week period, state data shows. Delta's prevalence soared in July [2021] but has been consistent over these last few months.

In the week of [13 Sep 2021], the latest time period available on the state's dashboard, fully vaccinated New Yorkers had a 78.6% lower chance of becoming a COVID-19 case compared with unvaccinated New Yorkers. That compares with a 91.9% differential for the week of [3 May 2021], which was before delta's exponential rise.

In terms of COVID hospitalizations, fully vaccinated New Yorkers had between an 89.7% and 95.2% lower chance of being admitted compared with unvaccinated New Yorkers across the full analytical time period.

To date, more than 76% of New Yorker's adult population is fully vaccinated, while 85.1% of adults in the state have received at least one dose. Among those eligible, kids ages 12 to 15 are far less likely to have completed their series (54%) compared with the next 2 cohorts (62.9% for those age 16-25 and 65.5% for those age 26-34). Nearly 2-thirds of kids age 12-15 have had at least one dose.

[2] French study: vaccine effectiveness
Date: Mon 11 Oct 2021

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/11/french-study-vaccines-cut-covid-deaths


Vaccination reduces the risk of dying or being hospitalised with COVID-19 by 90%, a French study of 22.6 million people over the age of 50 has found.

The research published on [Mon 11 Oct 2021] also found that vaccines appear to protect against the worst effects of the most prevalent virus strain, the delta variant. [https://www.epi-phare.fr/rapports-detudes-et-publications/impact-vaccination-covid-octobre-2021/]

"This means that those who are vaccinated are 9 times less at risk of being hospitalised or dying from COVID-19 than those who have not been vaccinated," the epidemiologist Mahmoud Zureik, who oversaw the research, told Agence France-Presse.

The study - the largest of its kind so far - was carried out by Epi-Phare a scientific group set up by France's health system, its national health insurance fund, l'Assurance Maladie (CNAM), and the country's ANSM medicines agency.

Researchers compared 11.3 million vaccinated over-50s with the same number of unvaccinated from the same age group between [27 Dec 2020], when vaccinations began in France, and [20 Jul 2021].

They found "a reduction in the risk of hospitalisation superior to 90%" from the 14th day after the 2nd dose and a similar reduction in the number of deaths from COVID-19. Similar findings have previously been published in Israel, the UK and the US.

The vaccines' effectiveness in combatting the most serious symptoms of COVID did not diminish during the 5-month period of the study, they said. The results were the same no matter whether the patient was given the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna or Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The Janssen one-dose shot, authorised later in France, was not included as the researchers felt there had not been enough patients or time to properly study its effectiveness.

Researchers only had a month between the emergence of the delta variant in France and the end of the study, but results showed the vaccines reduced the risk of serious symptoms and death by 84% among the over-75s and 92% for the 50-74 age group.

"This is a very short period to evaluate the real impact of the vaccination on this variant," Zureik said, adding that research was continuing into the effect of vaccines on the delta variant.

To ensure the closest possible comparison, researchers paired vaccinated and unvaccinated people of the same age and sex living in the same region. The study looked only at the most serious symptoms of infection and did not examine if the vaccines stopped people becoming infected or transmitting the virus.

Zureik said avoiding the most serious infections was "the main public health objective". "An epidemic without serious infections is no longer an epidemic," he added.

The report concludes: "All the vaccines [studied] against COVID-19 are highly effective and have a major effect on the reductions of serious forms of COVID-19 among people aged 50 years and older living at the current time in France. The continuing research by Epi-Phare will allow us to measure the evolution of this effectiveness over a longer period and better establish the effects on the delta variant."

[3] Transmission within families
Date: Mon 11 Oct 2021

Two new studies explore the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission among household members, one finding that children and adults are at similar risk and one showing that COVID-19-naïve family members' risk was 45% -- 97% lower, depending on the number of members immune through infection or full vaccination.

Transmission comparable across age groups
-----------------------------------------
Late last week [w/e 10 Oct 2021], a team led by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers published interim data from an ongoing study in JAMA Pediatrics involving a convenience sample of 1236 children and adults in 310 Utah and New York City households with at least one child. Participants submitted self-collected nasal swabs for COVID-19 testing and completed symptom questionnaires each week from September 2020 through April 2021. [Dawood FS, Porucznik CA, Veguilla V, et al. Incidence Rates, Household Infection Risk, and Clinical Characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Children and Adults in Utah and New York City, New York. JAMA Pediatr. Published online 8 Oct 2021. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.4217]

Average risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 40 households with at least one COVID-19 case was 52% (range, 11% to 100%). Risk was higher in New York City than in Utah, at 80% versus 44% (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 64% -- 91% and 36% -- 53%, respectively).

SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence rates were 3.8 (95% CI, 2.4 -- 5.9) and 7.7 (95% CI, 4.1 -- 14.5) per 1000 person-weeks in Utah and New York City, respectively, for an age-adjusted rate of 5.8 (95% CI, 3.1 -- 8.4).

Site-adjusted incidence rates per 1000 person-weeks were comparable across age groups, at 6.3 per 1000 person-weeks for children 0 -- 4 years (95% CI, 3.6 to 11.0), 4.4 for those 5 -- 11 (95% CI, 2.5 -- 7.5), 6 for those 12 to 17 (95% CI, 3.0 -- 11.7), and 5.1 for adults (95% CI, 3.3 -- 7.8).

A total of 36% of all participants submitted a respiratory sample after one or more episodes of symptomatic illness, and 8% tested positive for COVID-19. No COVID-19 cases were identified outside of the study or among vaccinated participants.

Asymptomatic illness in up to 52% of kids, 12% of adults
--------------------------------------------------------
The proportions of asymptomatic COVID-19 were 52% for children 0 -- 4 years, 50% for those 5 -- 11, 45% for those 12 -- 17, and 12% among adults. "A larger fraction of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children were asymptomatic and would likely have gone undetected without study testing, supporting hypotheses that SARS-CoV-2 infections among children have been substantially underascertained during the COVID-19 pandemic," the authors wrote.

Households had a median of 4 members and 2 adults, and almost half of participants were 18 and older (47%) while 14% were 0 -- 4 years old, 25% were 5 -- 11, and 13% were 12 -- 17. More than 47% of households reported annual incomes of USD 100 000 or more, while 7% had incomes below the poverty line.

As many as 23% of participants were Hispanic, and 71% were White. Of adults, 57% received 1 or 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine over the study period (19% partially and 38% fully vaccinated). Of the 652 children 0 -- 17 years, 71% attended daycare or school at some point during the study. The researchers noted that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults and children will change amid increasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake and circulation of virus variants of concern.

"Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies, such as handwashing, masking, physical distancing, and COVID-19 vaccination should target children in addition to adults to both mitigate individual health outcomes for children and reduce the overall burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community," they concluded.

Flor Munoz, MD, of Baylor College of Medicine, said in a linked commentary that the study findings can inform school, daycare, extracurricular activity, and camp planning, as well as public health strategies. [Munoz FM. If Young Children's Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Is Similar to That of Adults, Can Children Also Contribute to Household Transmission? JAMA Pediatr. Published online 8 Oct 2021. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.4225] "Pediatric populations, from infants to adolescents, must be included in pandemic preparedness, disease burden assessment, timely vaccine and therapeutics research, and strategies and policies for the control of outbreaks and pandemics from day 1 without delay," she wrote.

Vaccination slows spread in households
--------------------------------------
A study led by Umea University in Sweden, published today in JAMA Internal Medicine, studied 1 789 728 members of 814 806 Swedish families with at least one family member who had either had a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or was fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by [14 Apr 2021]. Each immune person was matched in a 1:1 ratio to a nonimmune member of a family with 2 --5 members. Average follow-up time was 26.3 days. [Nordstrom P, Ballin M, Nordstrom A. Association Between Risk of COVID-19 Infection in Nonimmune Individuals and COVID-19 Immunity in Their Family Members. JAMA Intern Med. Published online 11 Oct 2021. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.5814]

By [26 May 2021], 5.7% of 1 549 989 nonimmune family members tested positive for COVID-19. Families with one immune member had a 45% -- 61% lower chance of infection than those with no immune member (hazard ratio [HR], 0.39 -- 0.55). The risk reduction rose to 75% -- 86% in families with 2 immune members (HR, 0.14 -- 0.25), 91% -- 94% with 3 immune members (HR, 0.06 -- 0.09), and to 97% with 4 immune members (HR, 0.03). The results were comparable for the outcome of severe COVID-19 leading to hospital admission. For instance, in a 3-member family with 2 immune members, the nonimmune member had an 80% lower risk of infection (HR, 0.20).

"The results strongly suggest that vaccination is important not only for individual protection, but also for reducing transmission, especially within families, which is a high-risk environment for transmission," lead author Peter Nordstrom, MD, said in an Umea University news release. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930980]

The results were similar, regardless of whether the member became immune through previous infection or 1 or 2 vaccine doses. The authors, however, noted that the study was conducted when the alpha (B117) SARS-CoV-2 variant was dominant in Sweden, so the results may not apply to the more transmissible beta (B1351) or delta (B1617.2) variants that have emerged since then.
"
For instance, a single dose of the BNT162b2 [Pfizer/BioNTech] and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AstraZeneca/Oxford] vaccines has been associated with a modest protection (approximately 30%) against the delta variant, which seems to be the dominating variant in the most recent wave of the pandemic," the researchers wrote. "Although the results of this study indicate similar benefits of immunity from a single vaccine dose and full vaccination, the evidence on emerging variants may promote full vaccination."
