23 Nov 2016 Africa: Doctors in US, Africa work to contain future Ebola outbreaks
http://allafrica.com/stories/201611230639.html
[According to Dr Barb Marston of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, director of the CDC's office for Ebola-affected countries: "Our biggest focus in those 3 countries is on activities related to surveillance, laboratories and building human capacity. ... Right now, we have a team of between 50 and 60; that's counting Americans who are permanently stationed in the 3 countries plus some locally employed staff and also some staff [from] CDC traveling there temporarily to assist."
This kind of cooperation has proven to be helpful in dealing with the latest minor outbreaks, says CDC's Liberia country director, Dr Desmond Williams. "In March, we had a case again in a remote part in Guinea. One of the contacts from that family moved down to the capital city of Liberia, Monrovia," Dr Williams said. "But because the 2 governments were ready this time, we were able to limit that outbreak to 13 infected people and 9 people dead."
Dr Williams told VOA [Voice of America] that the agency's field epidemiology program has trained significant numbers of surveillance officers in Liberia, at the national, county and district levels, but the most important work has been developing laboratory capacity, so health care workers are able to diagnose [Ebola virus disease, EVD] infections rapidly...]

[Building laboratories and increasing human capacity on top of good surveillance is a strong public health approach. A lot has been learned, and a lot of training has taken place. If this can be sustained, rapid response to emergence of Ebola and other hemorrhagic viruses should go a long way to controlling virus transmission. - Mod.LK]

25 Nov 2016 Guinea: Guineans more trusting of doctors, hospitals since Ebola
http://www.voanews.com/a/guineans-more-trusting-of-doctors-hospitals-since-ebola/3611177.html
[Traditional healers who treat the ill are, after the Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, more likely to use more western approaches (such as chlorine bleach) in their work. The healers are also more likely to refer their patients to medical care facilities as soon as signs of possible severe infectious diseases appear.]

23 Nov 2016: Rapid testing crucial during Ebola outbreaks

[During the 2013 Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak, countries with already poor health care systems struggled to contain the early stages of the outbreak, and one of the worst problems they faced was the lack of any quick, reliable way to identify patients infected with the virus. According to Matt Scullion of BioFire Defense: "Tests would take 2 or 3, sometimes 4 days to get results back to hospitals. In the meantime, you had malaria patients in with Ebola patients, and if you didn't have Ebola before, you'd be likely to have Ebola after."
But as Ebola was multiplying unchecked across large areas of West Africa, a rapid-testing kit that had been in the works for years was ready to go at BioFire Defense, more than 10 000 km away in the western United States. The US firm, a subsidiary of a large French biomedical corporation, focuses on innovative technologies to help workers in the life sciences identify pathogens quickly and easily...
FilmArray is now one of 7 diagnostic tools the World Health Organization has approved for emergency use. According to the inspector general of Guinea's Health Ministry, Aboubakar Sidiki Diakite: "Before, we had to transport samples to Dakar, Senegal, or Lyon, France. But today, thanks to our partners in France, CDC in the US, and many others, we are able to make rapid diagnoses for EVD.]

[Rapid diagnosis is a key component of controlling spread of the virus, as infected individuals can be more quickly separated from individuals presenting with similar symptoms from other diseases. - Mod.LK]

25 Nov 2016 Nigeria: firms in bid to secure Nigeria oil contracts
http://allafrica.com/view/group/main/main/id/00047511.html
About 224 companies, hundreds of them indigenous Nigerian firms, are seeking to secure contracts for the sale and purchase of Nigerian crude oil grades on offer in 2017. [Nigeria's economy is heavily dependent on income from oil sales. The country is the largest African crude oil supplier to India; it annually exports 400 000 barrels per day to India valued at USD 10 billion annually. India is the largest purchaser of Nigerian oil, which fulfills 20 per cent to 25 per cent of India's domestic oil demand.]
