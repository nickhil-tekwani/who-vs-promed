Medical ethics and other experts say tough isolation measures,
involuntary if need be, are justified to contain very deadly,
highly-contagious and drug-resistant mutant strains of tuberculosis
and to prevent a potentially explosive international health crisis
brewing most dangerously in South Africa.
They warn that new variations of the disease now defeat many of the
world's existing drugs and the forced isolation and confinement of
XDR-TB (extensively drug resistant tuberculosis) and MDR-TB (multiple
drug resistant tuberculosis) infected individuals may be a
proportionate response in defined situations given the extreme risk posed.
Writing in the peer-reviewed online journal PLoS Medicine, co-authors
Ross Upshur, MD, Director of the University of Toronto Joint Centre
for Bioethics, and South Africa-based HIV-AIDS experts Jerome Amir
Singh and Nesri Padayatchi, MD, say the world community urgently
needs to help isolate and contain the threat.
The South African government's initial lethargic reaction to the
crisis and uncertainty amongst South African health professionals
concerning the ethical, social and human rights implications of
effectively tackling this outbreak highlight the need to address
these issues as a matter of urgency lest doubt and inaction spawn a
full-blown XDR-TB epidemic in South Africa and beyond, the paper says.
The WHO announced on 1 Sep 2006 that yet another deadly new strain of
extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) had been detected in
Tugela Ferry, a rural town in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) province, epicenter
of South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic. Eight days later, the WHO urged
a response to the outbreak akin to recent global efforts to control
SARS and bird flu.
The new strain in September 2006 appeared within a year of a study
showing 221 of 544 TB patients in KZN province had multi-drug
resistant tuberculosis unresponsive, at a minimum, to front-line
drugs rifampicin and isoniazid. Among the 221 cases, 53 were
extensively drug resistant, i.e. resistant to rifampicin and
isoniazid, and to 3 or more of the 6 potential 2nd line drug options.
Of the 53 XDR-TB patients, 44 were tested for HIV; all were infected
with that disease too. The median survival from the time of sputum
specimen collection was just 16 days for 52 of the 53 infected
individuals, including 6 health workers and those reportedly taking
anti-retroviral drugs.
Such a fatality rate for XDR-TB, especially within such a relatively
short period of time, is unprecedented anywhere in the world, the authors warn.
They note that South Africa is among the world's fastest growing
tourist destinations, home to millions of migrant laborers with ports
and roads servicing several African countries. Cumulatively, these
factors make for a potentially explosive international health crisis.
The threat to regional and global public health is thus clear and
further underlined by reports that XDR-TB is now considered endemic
to KZN, reported in at least 39 hospitals throughout the province and
in other parts of the country.
South African XDR-TB cases numbered 300 on 1 Dec 2006, and at least
30 new cases of XDR-TB are now reportedly detected each month in KZN
alone, according to the paper.
XDR-TB diagnoses to date (which require specialized laboratory
facilities) likely represent a small proportion of the true extent of
the problem. The number of persons harboring latent infections is
unknown and likely unknowable at present, they add.
Isolated cases of XDR-TB are documented in other regions and
countries, including Canada. However, the situation in South Africa
represents the world's 1st recognized instance of extensive
transmission of MDR- and XDR-TB, says Dr. Upshur. Isolated cases do
not so clearly raise the host of public health issues we discuss.
According to the paper, factors that facilitate the spread of
tuberculosis are well known and abundantly present in sub-Saharan
Africa. Alongside inadequate health care systems' response, poverty
and global inequity contribute to the worsening of the global TB situation.
Low TB cure rates (only about half of South Africa's adult patients
are cured each year, compared with 80 percent in countries with
better resources) and the HIV epidemic have contributed to South
Africa's MDR- and XDR-TB outbreak, the authors say. Underlying factors include:
- inappropriate treatment (e.g. the wrong choice of drugs, dosage or
treatment duration)
- program factors (e.g. irregular drug supply, incompetent health
personnel, lack of infection control in institutions), and
- patient factors (e.g. poor adherence, malabsorption).
Meanwhile, South African policies stipulate that those hospitalized
at state expense lose their social welfare benefits during
hospitalization (the median stay for a suspected case of MDR-TB:
almost 200 days). As a result, many patients forego hospitalization
and frequently default on treatment adherence. About one in 6 of the
country's patients default on the 6 month 1st-line treatment, while
almost 1/3rd default on 2nd-line treatment.
These same patients typically utilize public transport and seek or
continue employment. In so doing, they pose a significant public
health risk to their families, co-workers, local community, and the
wider public, the paper says.
Impoverished TB patients clearly need some form of incentive and
encouragement to enter and remain in the health system, although
admittedly, their confinement could conceivably be indefinite or
until they die.
The authors say South Africa urgently needs to:
- reduce crowding in hospitals where TB patients are being treated;
- drastically expand tests and surveillance of the disease;
- rethink counseling, treatment, reporting, and tracing strategies;
- find ways to reduce public exposure to suspected or confirmed MDR
and XDR-TB patients in the weeks or months it takes to diagnose the
disease; and
- accommodate the interests of infected patients in a sensitive and
humane manner.
Given the grave threat posed by these TB strains, the government
ought to consider how it prioritizes hospital resources. At minimum,
XDR-TB patients should be housed in facilities independent of both
MDR-TB and immuno-compromised (HIV) patients. The containment of such
infectious XDR-TB patients may arguably take precedence over those
with full-blown AIDS. This is an issue requiring urgent attention
from the global community.

[The issue of proper management and control of XDR-TB, now defined
slightly differently as mentioned above (an isolate resistant to INH
and rifampin that was also resistant to a fluoroquinolone and to one
or more of the following 3 injectable anti-tuberculosis drugs:
capreomycin, kanamycin and amikacin), is a vital one, and issues of
involuntary confinement and treatment must be discussed.
The PLoS article (Singh JA, Upshur R, Padayatchi N: XDR-TB in South
Africa: no time for denial or complacency. PLoS Medicine Vol. 4, No.
1, e50 doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0040050) can be found at:
<http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040050>.
The WHO position regarding such interventions in XDR-TB (for
references, see original URL) reflecting the Singh paper
<http://www.who.int/tb/xdr/involuntary_treatment/en/index.html> is:
"WHO places prevention and care of XDR-TB as a priority through the
strengthening of basic TB control and the necessary interventions to
cure existing cases. This includes strengthening political will
throughout affected countries to reduce the burden of TB, rapid
accurate bacteriological diagnosis, a secure supply of high quality
drugs, supervised and standardized treatment, and recording of the
outcome of every single patient at the end of treatment.
It also includes ensuring that the capacity to identify and treat
drug-resistant TB is in place, with a secure supply of 2nd-line
anti-TB drugs required for treating multidrug-resistant TB obtained
through the Green Light Committee (in resource-limited settings) (1),
as well as implementing good infection control procedures.
These measures are currently the best approach to the prevention and
care of XDR-TB and were listed among the recommendations supported by
international health experts at the 1st meeting of the WHO Global
Task Force on XDR-TB in October 2006 (2).
WHO's position with respect to the legal and ethical issues
surrounding compulsory TB treatment was published in 2001 (3) with
the specific purpose of ensuring prevention and control is
strengthened within a legal and human rights' framework. The
publication of a PLoS Medicine journal report (4) has highlighted
again the issues around compulsory treatment, particularly in
relation to drug-resistant TB.
WHO strongly recommends that governments must ensure, as their top
priority, that every patient has access to high quality TB diagnosis
and treatment for TB and drug-resistant forms of TB. It also fully
supports the rights and responsibilities of TB patients as
recommended in the Patients' Charter for TB Care (5).
In this regard, if a patient wilfully refuses treatment and, as a
result, is a danger to the public, the serious threat posed by XDR-TB
means that limiting that individual's human rights may be necessary
to protect the wider public. Therefore, interference with freedom of
movement when instituting quarantine or isolation for a communicable
disease such as MDR-TB and XDR-TB may be necessary for the public
good, and could be considered legitimate under international human rights law.
This must be viewed as a last resort and justified only after all
voluntary measures to isolate such a patient have failed.
A key factor in determining if the necessary protections exist when
rights are restricted is that each one of the 5 criteria of the
Siracusa Principles (6) must be met, but should be of a limited
duration and subject to review and appeal. The Siracusa principles are:
- the restriction is provided for and carried out in accordance with the law;
- the restriction is in the interest of a legitimate objective of
general interest;
- the restriction is strictly necessary in a democratic society to
achieve the objective;
- there are no less intrusive and restrictive means available to
reach the same objective;
- the restriction is based on scientific evidence and not drafted or
imposed arbitrarily, i.e. in an unreasonable or otherwise
discriminatory manner.
Responsibilities of TB treatment-providers to their patients are
detailed in The International Standards for Tuberculosis Care (7)."
