Zoo mourns again
----------------
Less than a fortnight after the city zoo in Thiruvananthapuram was
reopened to the public, a wild boar has died due to suspected foot
and mouth disease (FMD). Although results of the viral sampling tests
are yet to arrive, sources in the zoo say that the post-mortem
reports are suggestive of FMD.
"A wild boar with lesions in its foot died here on Wednesday [1 Aug
2007]. But we cannot confirm whether it was FMD unless we get the
results of viral sampling tests from the chief disease investigating
office," zoo veterinarian Dr. Jayakumar said.
The wild boar, which is an amplifier host of the FMD virus, can make
the FMD virus 400 times virulent [sic; it is not the virulence but
the quantity of virus which is amplified by pigs, estimated to be
hundreds-fold bigger than virus quantities produced and exhaled by
bovines. - Mod.AS]. For the same reason, zoo authorities are now
worried whether the virus would hit back with greater intensity in
which case even bigger animals like elephant and giraffe could be affected.
As a precautionary measure, the rest of the 19 wild boars in the herd
have been confined to a remote area of the zoo. The technical
committee presided over by animal husbandry director R. Vijayakumar
also convened a meeting on Wednesday [1 Aug 2007].
Asked whether the rest of the stock would be culled if the sample
tests confirmed FMD, Vijayakumar said that a decision could be taken
only after the results were out. "Whether to slaughter the animals or
isolate them in another area would be decided by the technical
committee after the results arrive," he said.
Meanwhile, zoo veterinarian Dr. Jayakumar said that the intensity of
a 2nd outbreak could be milder as most of the animals could have
attained immunity after the 1st outbreak.
The FMD outbreak was 1st reported from the zoo on 3 Jul 2007 when a
mithun died due to the viral infection. Later, 3 more mithuns died
following which a technical committee, comprising top officials and
veterinarians of the Animal Husbandry Department, decided to
euthanise the rest of the 3 mithuns in the stock to prevent further outbreak.
The zoo was later closed to public on 8 Jul 2007 when the viral
infection also killed as many as 15 black bucks. However, even after
the zoo was reopened, the authorities have not yet identified the
source of the infection.
A majority of animals in the herd of Sambar deer, Spotted deer, Cape
buffalo, Nilgai and the entire herd of Black buck are still affected
with the FMD virus. A total of 3 more black bucks had died after the
zoo was reopened.
Apart from the placing of the foot-dips at the entry and exit points
of the zoo, no other permanent precautionary have been taken so far.

[The FMD virus, serotype O, which -- reportedly -- has already killed
several wild cloven-hoofed (artiodactyla) animals of protected
species since its introduction into the famous Thiruvananthapuram zoo
more than a month ago, is endemic in India. A vaccine is available,
and used in domestic livestock in India.
Has vaccination of susceptible species in the zoo been
considered/applied in the zoo since the onset of the outbreak? - Mod.AS.]
