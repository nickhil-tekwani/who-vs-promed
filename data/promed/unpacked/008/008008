WASHINGTON (April 29) - Giant meat packer IBP Inc has recalled a nationwide
shipment of ground beef sent to 50 large customers after U.S. Agriculture
Department scientists found one sample tainted with a potentially deadly
bacteria, the government and IBP said Wednesday. The recall of some 282,129
pounds of beef -- a relatively modest amount by meat packing standards --
came amid growing efforts by the USDA and federal lawmakers to tighten food
safety rules.
Health departments in some 20 states were notified of the contamination, but
there have been no reports of illnesses linked to the bad meat, said Jacquee
Knight, a spokeswoman for the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
The suspect beef was produced by an IBP plant in Geneseo, Illinois April 14.
Although only one sample tested positive for the E.coli 0157:H7 bacteria,
the company recalled all the ground beef produced that day and shipped to 50
retail and food-service customers, including one military base.
The USDA detected the bacteria during a random E.coli test of IBP product,
Knight said. Knight acknowledged there was a possibility that some of the
suspect meat had already been eaten by consumers.
The USDA launched an E.coli 0157:H7 testing program for meat plants and retail
stores in 1994. Since the program began, USDA scientists have tested more than
20,000 samples and found 13 contaminated with the virulent bacteria, that can
cause bloody diarrhea and kidney failure.
