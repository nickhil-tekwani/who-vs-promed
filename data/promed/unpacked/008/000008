New Illinois Survey Uncovers More Disease Problems in Soybean Fields
--------------------------------------------------
Soybean growers in Illinois are facing a major outbreak of charcoal rot of
soybean according to a recent survey conducted by researchers from the
University of Illinois [UI] and Southern Illinois University [SIU], Carbondale.
The annual survey is conducted in late August and early September of each
year to determine the levels of various diseases as the soybean crop heads
toward harvest. Primary funding is provided by the Illinois Soybean
Checkoff Board.
According to Glen Hartman, USDA plant pathologist at UI, and Jason Bond at
SIU, large numbers of fields in northern, central, and southern parts of
the state are affected.
Charcoal rot is caused by a soil-inhabiting fungus that can be found in
virtually every field in the state. Symptoms of the disease normally show
up only during periods of hot, dry weather.
"Every time we have any drought conditions, we can get charcoal rot,"
Hartman said. "A long dry period with high temperatures in August 2003 was
enough for the fungus to take hold and cause the problems we are seeing
right now."
Infected soybean plants turn brown and mature early but are not often
killed outright before podding occurs, especially when the disease occurs
late in the growing season, as it did this year.
"Under the current conditions, yield losses could run from very little up
to 30 percent," Hartman said. "The problem will most often vary greatly
within different parts of a field.
Hartman points out that there are currently no practical options for
managing this disease. "We do not have any resistant varieties available to
recommend to growers," he said. The only way to control this problem is to
irrigate or not plant soybeans in a field for 10 or 15 years, which is
impractical.
Hartman advocates a 2-pronged research approach for dealing with the
problem in the long term.
"We need to look at both bio-tech and traditional approaches to finding
genetic resistance," he said. "Our screening for resistance so far has
looked at only a small portion of the 16 000 soybean accessions in the USDA
Soybean Germplasm Collection housed at the UI. We may also have to extend
the search to the wild progenitor of the modern soybean and the perennial
relatives of the soybean."
Hartman said that if "we had a 2-3 year period of dry weather, charcoal rot
would suddenly become the most important disease threat to our soybean
crop." He advises that a vigorous screening program be implemented, even
when there is no disease threat. Eventually there would be resistant
soybean cultivars as insurance against this potentially troublesome disease.

[Charcoal rot, caused by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Macrophomina
phaseolina_, occurs worldwide. It is a weak pathogen, but under drought
conditions (27- 35 deg C) Mp can induce severe stress on soybean. It also
infects corn. Disease management involves reduction of plant stress
(providing adequate moisture, optimum fertility, and proper spacing between
plants), utilization of resistant cultivars, and crop rotation away from
soybean for 2 years. - Mod.DH]
