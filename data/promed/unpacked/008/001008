From: John Bingham <johnb@moon.ovi.ac.za>

We do indeed occasionally get cases of FAT false negatives, which we detect
on biological tests (inoculation of neuroblastoma cell cultures). On
repeating the FA test most of these cases were found to have antigen only
in localised areas, particularly in the brain stem. Most of these cases are
from improperly vaccinated animals or animals vaccinated during the
incubation period.
Although nearly all rabid animals will have large amounts of rabies
virus/antigen throughout the brain, therefore giving unambiguous results, a
few will have localised antigen. For this reason it is important to sample
all regions of the brain, particularly the brain stem, for the FA and
biological tests. Where there is a discrepancy between FA and biological
tests it is also important to take into consideration that the biological
test may be a false positive. Rotten brains can sometimes give ambiguous
FAT readings.
I have not seen ACIP recommendations MMWR.48.RR-1 8 January 1999, so I
cannot comment on them. The sensitivity of the FAT can be very close to
100% with good quality specimens, good laboratory techniques and
experienced test readers.
