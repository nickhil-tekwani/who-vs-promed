Following a suspected anthrax outbreak, 2 people have been reported
dead in Murang'a District, Central Province. The 2 persons from
Gikandu village died after consuming beef from sick animals.

According to a witness a villager slaughtered his sick cow on [8 May
2010] and invited his neighbours for a feast. Later, on [15 May 2010],
another villager also slaughtered a cow, which had similar symptoms.
But [a man] who was among those who had consumed the beef died on 23
May 2010. [The 2nd man] died yesterday [27 May 2010], raising fears
that the animals might have had anthrax. The 1st victim died at the
Murang'a district hospital where medical tests showed signs of
anthrax. His son is in serious condition.

Ironically, the local public health officer had certified the beef
from the 2 animals fit for human consumption.

The provincial administration urged residents showing symptoms of the
disease to quickly seek medical attention. As a result, residents have
been cautioned against eating uninspected meat or meat from animals
that appear to be sick.

[Only latterly has anthrax been adequately reported in Kenya. For
years it existed but was not recognized. In 2001 there were 10
officially reported human cases but 441 villagers in Maragwa district
were treated and 10 hospitalized, plus 4 people affected in Murang'a
in the following month. Between December 2005 and January 2006 there
were 2 dead, 5 hospitalised, and 99 treated in Maragua, Meru, and
Samburu districts. There were 10 cases in 2007 and 19 cases with 2
deaths in 2008. It is probably not coincidental that between December
2005 and March 2006, 53 Grevy's zebra and 26 plains zebra died from
anthrax in southern Samburu, plus some 7 animals in the Central
Province and 6 in the Nairobi area.

Cattle outbreaks are most commonly reported in the Central Province
and around Nairobi, which may be more a function of reporting bias.
During 2005 through 2008, bovine outbreaks have been reported in
Nairobi (19 outbreaks), Central (36), Rift Valley (13), Coast (4), and
Eastern (8) Provinces.
