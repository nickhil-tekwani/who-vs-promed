----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chile is currently facing an increase of meningococcal disease and also a shift of serotypes compared to the year 2011.

The surveillance system of the Chilean Ministry of Health has reported the following numbers, which reflect the epidemiological situation of meningococcal disease for 2012 from week 1 to 40 [1 Jan-6 Oct 2012]:

There are a total of 83 accumulated cases compared with 52 for the total of 2011 (median number of cases 2007-2011: 76). The increase is mainly observed in 2 Chilean regions: the Metropolitan Region (RM), which includes Santiago, with 58 percent of cases and the region of Valparaiso with 21 percent of cases. The RM is divided into several health administrative regions; of those, 3 were mostly affected.

Interestingly, in the RM 76 percent of cases were caused by serogroup W135, compared with 14 percent and 48 percent in the years 2010 and 2011, respectively. This epidemiological change is not observed in the other regions, where serogroup B is predominant.

The most affected age groups are children under the age of 5 (48 percent of cases); almost half of those are 9 months or younger. In the age group under 5 years, 55 percent of the cases are caused by serogroup W135.

The reported case fatality rate reached 20 percent (17/83) and seems to be higher than in previous years (2011: 15 percent). This increase might be related to serogroup W135, since, of 9 fatal cases with available serogroup, 6 belonged to this group. According to our information, the Chilean Ministry of Health is planning to start a targeted vaccination campaign (with quadrivalent conjugate vaccine) focusing on the areas and age groups mostly affected by serotype W135 by the end of October 2012.
