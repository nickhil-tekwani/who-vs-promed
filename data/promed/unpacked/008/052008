In response to the request for information regarding the post Undiagnosed disease, canine - Australia: RFI 20171104.5423881, the diagnosis was necrotising fasciitis due to _Streptococcus canis_ (Lancefield Group G Streptococcus). The association with melioidosis (infection with _Burkholderia pseudomallei_) is erroneous.

[We appreciate Dr. Shilton's clarification.

_Streptococcus canis_ is a group G beta-hemolytic species of _Streptococcus_. It was first isolated in dogs, giving the bacterium its name.

Strains of this bacterium (_S. canis_) have been reported to cause diseases in a variety of mammals. During infection, the bacteria have been known to cause neonatal septicemia, abortion, and cellulitis in dogs. In addition, _S. canis_ is also responsible for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and necrotizing fasciitis (NF). However, it has been contested if STSS and NF are caused solely by _S. canis_ infection or if it is induced from the treatment of dogs with fluoroquinolone during the infection.

In other mammals, the pathogen can cause lymphadenitis, arthritis, fever, mastitis, wound infections, and other conditions that vary depending on the host species. The possibility of an outbreak increases for animals that are very young, very old, confined to a densely populated area, or remain confined for long periods of time. Multiple fatal outbreaks have been reported among shelter cats due to the susceptibility of many of the cats and the close proximity of individuals within a shelter. The development of disease can occur rapidly, and symptoms in cats include skin ulceration, chronic respiratory infection, and necrotizing sinusitis. The persistence and spread of these bacteria in a confined area can lead to both sepsis and death, quickly resulting in extremely high levels of mortality among susceptible cats. Similar instances have been reported for dogs; however, the levels of mortality were considerably lower.

Hopefully things in Australia are better.
