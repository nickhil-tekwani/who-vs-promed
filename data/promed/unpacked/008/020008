Alert after Dutch potato disease found in Scotland
--------------------------------------------------
The discovery of a highly infectious crop disease in a field of
potatoes near Coupar Angus [Perthshire] has shocked Scottish seed
potato growers this week. _Dickeya solani_ causes the tubers and
haulm [stalks] to rot, and outbreaks in England have been linked to
purchases of seed potatoes from the Netherlands, which has suffered
several outbreaks.

Efforts have been made to keep it out of Scotland [see ProMED-mail
post 20100208.0421]. The Scottish potato industry set up a "safe
haven" programme intended to prevent seed [tubers] coming from areas
faced with infection. Now, it appears that seed of a new Dutch bred
variety called Innovator has been brought north from England and
planted in the centre of a major seed growing area in Perthshire.

The Scottish Government agency Science and Advice for Scottish
Agriculture [SASA] has already said the crop will be destroyed as
soon as possible and the seed put to landfill. However, _Dickeya
solani_ can live in the soil for a long time and can be spread
through water courses, with potentially serious implications for
other growers downstream. The infection is currently limited to one
field on one farm and was picked up as part of a Scottish Government
inspection.

[2] Early and late blights - Ireland

All systems go in fight against potato blight
---------------------------------------------
Met Eireann [Irish National Meteorological Service] issued its 1st
potato [late] blight warning of the current season [2010]. Conditions
favouring the spread of blight were predicted in the south, west, and
northwest of the country.

This is the cue to start control programmes on crops where the canopy
is developing. All potato plants over the ground require fungicides
to protect them, when weather conditions are conducive to the spread
of blight. These need to be applied before the infection takes hold.
As the crop develops control programmes can switch to systemic and
translaminar products. Changes in recent years to the late blight
population have meant that the use of phenylamide-based products
should be limited to a single application.

In recent years an increased level of early blight has been detected,
particularly in the south and southeast.

[Blackleg
--------
Blackleg caused by _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp. _atrosepticum_
can cause severe losses in potato crops. However, an even more
virulent form of blackleg emerged in recent years as a major threat
spreading in Europe and Israel. The cause has only been identified as
a new bacterial species in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20091207.4162)
currently referred to as _Dickeya solani_. Symptoms resemble
"traditional" blackleg and include wilting of plants and tuber rot,
but the disease appears to be more aggressive and causes damage under
a wider range of conditions and at lower bacterial loadings.
Preliminary results from Europe indicate that the new species will
rapidly take over as the principal cause of blackleg-like symptoms in
potato crops.

The bacterium is spread with contaminated plant or other material
(including seed tubers), by mechanical means, and water. Disease
management includes seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use
of clean planting material, and phytosanitation to prevent
introduction of the pathogen from external sources. Low levels of
seed tuber infection pose a major risk of pathogen spread, and
therefore quarantine measures and certification schemes are a vital
part of disease management. Despite an alert to regional growers
earlier in 2010 (see ProMED-mail post 20100208.0421), unfortunately
attempts to keep _D. solani_ out of Scotland appear to be failing.

Late blight
------------
Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The
pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. PLB
is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers), wind and
water. Disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of
seed tubers and crops. Considerable variation in aggressiveness
between different pathogen strains has been observed, but more
virulent strains are emerging frequently.

A new strain (Blue 13) with resistances to some widely used
fungicides has recently been reported for the first time in Ireland
(ProMED-mail post 20100212.0505) and has considerably increased the
risk for the national potato industry. Phenylamides (PA) are a highly
active class of fungicides widely used against PLB, but the
sensitivity of populations fluctuates from year to year and within
the season. The advice above to limit their use to a single
application is most likely based on the current proportion of PA
resistant PLB strains in the country.

Early blight
-------------
Early blight of potato and tomato is caused by the fungus _Alternaria
solani_. It causes leaf spots and tuber blight on potato, and leaf
spots, fruit rot, and stem lesions on tomato. The disease can occur
over a wide range of climatic conditions and can result in complete
defoliation and severe yield losses. The pathogen often causes no
visible symptoms until plants approach maturity. It is spread with
infected plant material (including tubers, transplants, and seed), by
mechanical means, wind, and rain. Solanaceous weeds and volunteer
crop plants may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management
includes use of certified clean propagation material, fungicides,
crop rotation, and use of cultivars with reduced susceptibility. An
alert for early blight has also been issued for the UK for the 2010
season (ProMED-mail post 20100208.0421).
