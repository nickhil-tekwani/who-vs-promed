Follow-up report No. 1
Text of an e-mail received on 18 August 1999 from Dr Vasilios Stylas, Head,
Animal Health Directorate, Ministry of Agriculture, Athens:
End of previous report period: 12 August 1999 (see Disease Information, 12
[31, 111, dated 13 August 1999).
End of this report period: 18 August 1999.
1. Results of epidemiological surveillance in Evros and Rodopi
1.1 Clinical surveillance
In the course of on-going targeted clinical surveillance, clinical signs
compatible with bluetongue were identified in 3 sheep flocks.
Outbreaks:
Location No. of outbreaks
Evros 1
Rodopi 2
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
species : ovine
susceptible: 525
cases: 16
deaths: 9*
destroyed:---
slaughtered:---
* Note: dead animals were reported by the farmer and their death cannot be
definitively attributed to bluetongue.
Intensive clinical surveillance has been extended to include the entire
territories of Evros and Rodopi.
1.2 Serological surveillance
The purpose of serological surveillance in Evros and Rodopi is now twofold,
namely:
- to investigate the extent of infection in already affected areas;
- to detect new potentially affected areas.
The cumulated results of serological surveillance are summarised in the
table below.
Prefecture: Evros
Date of sampling: 03-11/08/99
No. of animals sampled & results (total/positive)
cattle: 313/25
sheep: 111/01
goats: 190/05
Prefecture: Rodopi
Date of sampling: 05-12/08/99
No. Of animals sampled & results (total/positive)
cattle: 228/ 09
sheep: 1,686/31
goats. 80/0
1.3 Discussion of clinical and serological findings
A preliminary assessment of the clinical and serological findings available
to date leads to the following working hypotheses of epidemiological
significance:
- With regard to the estimated time of incursion, it is considered as recent
(probably during the last week of July) on the basis of the low
sero-prevalence observed in affected areas and taking into account the
maximum incubation period before clinical signs are manifested in sheep (20
days).
- With regard to the route of incursion, on the basis of geographical,
meteorological and terrain considerations in conjunction with the clinical
and serological findings available to date, there are probably 2, and
possibly 3, independent but simultaneous routes of incursion.
The 3 clinical outbreaks along with seropositive animals in mid-western
Evros appear to be linked together and are probably due to wind-borne
vectors carried by northerly winds from south-eastern Bulgaria (region of
Haskovo or, more likely, Kardjali).
The single farm with seropositive cattle in Pentalofos, Evros, is clearly
directly linked to the cluster of outbreaks in Haskovo region, Bulgaria, and
in this case the infected vectors were simply carried along the valley of
the river Ardas.
On the other hand, seropositive bovines found in Mandra, Evros, are situated
adjacent to the border with Turkey and are difficult to link with either the
outbreaks in Bulgaria or those in Greece. [But see todayÂ´s ProMED report of
bluetongue in Thrace, Turkey - Mod.JW
With regard to the means of infection, all research has so far failed to
identify vectors of the species _Culicoides imicola_, but has produced large
numbers of _Culicoides obsoletus_. Since the latter species is not the
predominant vector of bluetongue, its efficacy in spreading the disease is
probably dependent on the sheer numbers of this particular midge.
- With regard to the spreading of infection, it appears that it may be
geographically limited in clusters, reflecting either favourable local
weather and terrain conditions or the adequate size of local populations of
non-specific vectors or, simply, early detection.
2. Results of surveillance in Evros and Rodopi
On 12 August 1999, a Level B-1 alert was declared in Xanthi, Serres, Drama
and Kilkis, along the entire length of the border with Bulgaria. In the four
Prefectures concerned clinical surveillance has produced negative results to
date, while the results of serological screening are not yet available.
