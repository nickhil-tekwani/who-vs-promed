According to the media, there is an outbreak of legionellosis in the
Norwegian towns of Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg. The Norwegian newspaper
Aftenposten reports that 11 cases have so far been confirmed,
including 2 deaths (females, 70-80 years of age).

Investigations are ongoing, cooling towers being the main suspects
and some having already been closed down pending results of
test samples.

Growing epidemic of Legionnaires' disease in Fredrikstad
--------------------------------------------------------
Altogether, 5 persons have died, and one is critically ill in the
hospital, following an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the
Fredrikstad and Sarpsborg region. Another 20 have contracted
legionellosis and have been hospitalized, and the condition is
serious for 3 of these persons.

Most of the dead and infected are elderly, or weakened by other diseases.

The disease is not spread by personal contact but through the air,
often from water vapor from large air conditioning systems. The
source of the infection has not been found, but large air
conditioning systems in the 2 cities have been closed down.

In 2001, 7 persons died from Legionnaires' disease in the city of Stavanger
[see ref. below. - Mod.JW].

Legionnaires' outbreak kills 3 in Norway
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease has killed 3 people and left at
least 23 others infected in southeastern Norway, public health
officials said on Mon 23 May 2005. The 1st cases were reported on Sat
21 May 2005 in the town of Fredrikstad, some 80 km (50 miles) south
of Oslo.

The National Institute of Public Health said all those infected live
in or had recently visited the Fredrikstad area. Generally, they were
older, with an average age of 69, the institute said. The source of
the infection had not been determined, but the potentially deadly
respiratory illness is caused by _Legionella_ bacteria, which grow in
water and can be spread through air conditioning ducts and water
cooling towers.

"The municipal heath services ... have taken steps to shut down
cooling towers in the towns, so there is a great probability that the
source of the outbreak has been stopped," the institute said in a
statement.

[The 2 municipalities are geographically close to one another, so it is
indeed possible that this somewhat explosive cluster (26 cases over 3 days)
may have been exposed in the same location. ProMED thanks Egil Bovim,
Director, National Centre on Emergency Communication in Health Bergen,
Norway, for calling attention to this cluster. - Mod.LL]
