With Nigeria almost at the last stage of being declared a polio-free country, the Lagos state government has confirmed the environmental strand [???] of polio virus in Makoko, Itire and Maracana canals in the state.

Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Titilayo Goncalves, who disclosed this at a day media/stakeholders sensitization workshop in Lagos on Thursday [13 Jun 2019], said the state government, with support from the United Nations Children's Funds (UNICEF) and other agencies, is gearing up for another polio vaccination campaign in this regard from Sat 15 Jun 2019 to Tue 18 Jun 2019.

Goncalves said the campaign is aimed at eliminating the polio virus found in the state, adding that the State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is very passionate in ensuring that no child in Lagos suffers disability or dies as a result of vaccine-preventable diseases.

"The 2nd phase of the polio vaccination campaign is in furtherance of the noble goal that all our children in Lagos State be covered by the present immunization campaign which is being done house to house so that the 100% status of polio immunization will be attained, maintained and sustained.

"We have made good progress in this bid with the cooperation and support of other agencies and development partners, but we are still pursuing this goal with great determination and focus so that no single child between 0 and 59 months should remain unimmunized or unprotected from the polio virus," she added.

The 4-day campaign which will be flagged off tomorrow [14 Jun 2019] will commence on 15 Jun 2019 and close on 18 Jun 2019, and the operations will be between the hours of 8 am and 4 pm daily, says Goncalves, adding that no child should be left out.

"It is an opportunity for parents and caregivers to catch up with the other immunizations by going to the PHCs and general hospitals in their neighborhood. It is safe, it is free. It is not dangerous at all. It can be taken in spite of former immunization status. In fact no child is safe from the vaccine-preventable diseases until immunized," she added.

Dr. Usman Adamu from Primary Health Care Board, Abuja, said data from the last polio campaign revealed that the main reasons some children were not vaccinated in Lagos State include estates and gated communities refusing entry of immunization teams and many parents claimed not to have heard about the immunization campaign.

As long as a single child remains unprotected by immunization, there is a high risk for infection to occur, says Adamu, while urging the media to create more awareness on the need for parents to ensure that their children under age 5 years get vaccinated against polio.

He, however, appealed to every parent and caregiver to ensure that all children that are 5 years and below receive polio vaccine when health workers come knocking between 15 and 18 Jun 2019 while children zero months to 5 years are also taken to the health posts so designated for other vaccinations.

[It is not surprising that poliovirus has been identified in Lagos canals, as Lagos is the largest city in Nigeria and there is significant population movement from outside of Lagos into Lagos proper. The most recent positive environmental samples and cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) have been from Kwara State, which is an approximately 6-hour drive from Lagos (349.6 km or 217.1 mi). A map of Nigeria showing states can be found at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/nigeria-administrative-map.htm.

The above article mentions that the type of poliovirus was an "environmental strain". Not having heard of environmental strains, I will speculate that they are referring to a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV) in this case. That being said, more information would be greatly appreciated on the type of virus identified, including information on the genetic relationships between the samples and existing known cVDPVs currently circulating in Nigeria. Presumably during the house-to-house campaign, the vaccinators will be looking for new-onset AFP cases to see whether the environmental samples were associated with actual cases or healthy carriers. - Mod.MPP
