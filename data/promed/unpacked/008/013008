A World Society for the Protection of Animals funded vaccination
program is providing a successful alternative to inhumane mass
culling of stray dogs.

Across the world, hundreds of thousands of stray dogs are killed by
government-led inhumane mass cullings, during which animals are
poisoned, electrocuted, clubbed or shot in attempts to curb the
spread of rabies. However, in the lead up to World Rabies Day on 28
Sep 2010, Bali's government has committed to a more humane and
[potentially] successful approach to eradicating rabies, implementing
a model program that other countries can begin to use as part of
their own rabies control efforts.

The Bali government today [21 Sep 2010] signed an agreement
authorizing a mass vaccination campaign to immunize nearly 400 000
dogs. The new, island-wide program is being funded by the World
Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA), working closely with
the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA), and is an essential 1st
step toward the government's goal to eradicate rabies from the island by 2012.

Mike Baker, Chief Executive Officer of WSPA, said: "By choosing to
eradicate rabies through a dedicated vaccination effort, Bali is
taking the most effective route to protecting the health of its
citizens, as well as the thousands of tourists who visit the island
every year. With this campaign, Bali is set to take centre stage and
demonstrate a perfect model for rabies control to other countries
where rabies continues to be a challenge."

Earlier this year [2010], WSPA and BAWA developed a pilot vaccination
project for 2 of Bali's regencies. BAWA teams vaccinated 65 000 dogs
during this time, thereby preventing rabies from spreading throughout
the dog population and protecting human health in the area; these
accomplishments lead to today's [21 Sep 2010] agreement with the Bali
government. As part of the new agreement, teams of trained animal
handlers will begin to immunize dogs in the remaining 7 regencies of
Bali. (Footnote 1). The World Health Organization (WHO) describes
such vaccinations as: "Globally, the most cost-effective strategy for
preventing rabies in people" (Footnote 2).

The Governor of Bali, speaking at the signing event, said: "The
Balinese community lives in harmony with its animals and did not want
to see them killed, but we did not have a choice in our fight against
rabies; thanks to the international community, we now have a humane
alternative for protecting our people and our animals."

News of this joint initiative is being welcomed by the international
community committed to the common goal of rabies eradication. Deborah
Briggs, the CEO of the Global Alliance for Rabies Control, said:
"We've seen enough evidence from around the world to reinforce our
belief that this mass vaccination project is the single most
effective measure in saving the lives of people on Bali" (Footnote 3).

WSPA designed the vaccination program in close consultation with the
Bali government, as the authorities will reclaim responsibility for
managing and providing resources for the project following the end of
phase one. This phase has been supported by AusAID, who generously
donated 370 000 doses of the rabies vaccine to supplement those
already procured by the Bali government.

The Bali government's resuming ownership for the program will ensure
that the critical immunity threshold -- of at least 70 percent of
Bali's dog population being vaccinated -- is maintained year on year,
until the island can safely celebrate being rabies free.

Footnote 1. Bali is divided into 9 regencies: Buleleng, Jembrana,
Tabanan, Badung, Bangli, Karangasem, Denpasar, Klungkung and Gianyar.
As part of a WSPA-funded pilot project, teams from BAWA have already
completed vaccinating more than 70 percent of the dogs in Gianyar and
Bangli regencies.

Footnote 2. Please see WHO's factsheet on rabies:
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en:/>.

Footnote 3. As WSPA pointed out while submitting its proposal for
island-wide vaccination, animal vaccination has been shown to be the
most effective way to control rabies. In Mexico, for example, 16
million dogs are vaccinated every year, and the disease is close to
eradication. In Flores, Indonesia, 1/3rd of the dog population was
culled between 1998 and 2001, yet rabies there remains a serious
problem (see:
<http://www.wspa-usa.org/download/213_09_21_casestudy_gianyar_rabies_final.pdf>).

Footnote 4. WSPA's funding for the Bali vaccination project is
supported in part by funds received from the International Fund for
Animal Welfare.

[This is a welcome development which, if sustained, may break the
cycle of rabies virus transmission in the island of Bali. The WSPA is
to be commended for this new initiative.
