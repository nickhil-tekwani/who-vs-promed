Mexico: Confirmed Cases of West Nile Virus Infection in Equines and Birds
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following figures have been extracted from the Maps of West Nile virus
activity in Mexico.
Equines
-------
As of 4 Sep 2003 there have been 624 confirmed equine cases of West Nile
virus infection out of 3477 animals tested. 13 of the 19 states undertaking
surveillance reported West Nile virus-positive equine cases, include 45
separate municipalities. [The number of cases obtained by summing the
individual state data gives a slightly higher total of West Nile
virus-positive equine cases (777), perhaps because data up to 12 Sep 2003
may be included. The states reporting positive results are located
throughout the country, and it is likely that West Nile virus has
penetrated further south than the southern border of Mexico. In contrast to
the situation in the United States, all most all of these cases are
asymptomatic. The interpretation of this situation is discussed below. -

Wild birds
----------
31 birds have tested positive for West Nile virus infection out of 13 633
birds tested. 5 of the 7 states undertaking surveillance reported West Nile
virus-positive avian cases. [Again, the number of positive results obtained
by summing the individual state data gives a slightly larger total of West
Nile virus-positive cases (53), possibly for the reason given above. The
states reporting positive results are located throughout the country, and
it is likely that West Nile virus has penetrated further south than the
southern border of Mexico. - Mod.CP]
Humans
------
No confirmed West Nile virus-positive results have been reported anywhere
in Mexico.

[The following report is a translation of a government document addressing
the question of the failure so far to detect transmission of West Nile
virus infection to humans in Mexico, despite the apparent high prevalence
of West Nile virus infection in equines:
"As a result of epidemiologic and epizoologic surveillance established in
Mexico to detect West Nile virus, 464 equines and 25 birds of diverse
species have been found asymptomatically positive for West Nile virus in 13
states and 45 municipalities. This is in contrast to what is seen in the
USA, where a large number of animals develop the disease. At the same
time, it has been discussed that there must be some explanation why in
Mexico we have not detected cases of the disease in humans, given that
surveillance activities cover all health organizations and have considered
182 cases of clinical probable meningoencephalitis, all of which have been
negative [for West Nile virus infection].
One of the hypotheses put forward by the Vectors Group of the Secretariat
of Health is that the current status of West Nile virus in Mexico could
represent the stage prior to the appearance of outbreaks, and that the
virus is conforming itself to the ecology of the different environments in
the country. Another hypothesis -- developed through an interchange between
experts in the State of Texas and the National Program of Vector-borne
disease of the Secretariat of Health of Mexico -- is that the previous
widespread circulation of the 4 serotypes of dengue virus may play some
role in the lack of detection of West Nile virus infection, in that the
structures of the 2 viruses have many similarities, such that diagnostic
tests may exhibit cross-reactivity of almost the same magnitude. That is
to say, any person having suffered from dengue in the past may have a
positive IgM or IgG reaction to West Nile virus. For this reason the 2
groups are conducting studies that may explain the absence of human cases.
A similar situation may exist in the case of equines and birds, where only
2 sick animals have so far been detected.
The situation with West Nile virus in the USA for the 2003 is disturbing,
in that the incidence of the disease has increased to an alarming extent,
with 715 human cases and 14 deaths as of 20 Aug 2003. In 2002, there were
only 269 cases reported by the same date. In addition, 84 percent of the
cases are concentrated in the states of Colorado (36.8 percent), South
Dakota (16.4 percent), Nebraska (13.8 percent), Texas (9.8 percent),
Louisiana (4.2 percent) and Wyoming (2.9 percent)."

This report raises interesting questions about cross-reactivity, both in
terms of protection as well as possible false positivity. Further
information is awaited with interest. - Mod.MPP]
