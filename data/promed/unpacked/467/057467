USA: Suspected Norovirus Outbreak Closes Cornell School in Coraopolis
--------------------------------------------------
[A schoolbus] driver said he has never seen anything like it in the 30
years he's transported students to the Cornell Educational Center in
Coraopolis. But the stomach illness that has plagued students, teachers,
and staff at the school since Thursday [18 Mar 2004] has continued to
spread rapidly, causing administrators to dismiss all of the district's 800
students early Tuesday [23 Mar 2004] and close the school for the remainder
of the week. All meetings and extracurricular activities also have been
postponed. Classes are scheduled to resume Mon 29 Mar 2004. The cause of
the illness has not been identified officially, but the Allegheny County
Health Department suspects it might be a consequence of norovirus infection.
Superintendent Dennis Johnson said the decision to close the school was
made after 80 elementary and 55 high school students did not report to
class on Tuesday. An additional 11 students were sent home sick in the 2
hours that school was in session. "It was in the best interest and safety
of our students and staff to dismiss early (Tuesday)," Johnson said.
"Students were literally getting sick while taking tests." The district was
in the midst of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment tests, which
will be postponed until further notice. Johnson said he has been in contact
with the Pennsylvania Department of Education about the situation.
"This is definitely rare and a very strange situation," said Bethany
Yenner, spokeswoman for the department. "This isn't something you typically
see."
The illness began appearing Thursday among elementary students. Elementary
music teacher Martha Karipin said a kindergarten student was sick in her
classroom during the school day on Thursday. Many other students became
sick later that evening while attending the school's science fair. The
district dismissed all students early on Friday after nearly 80 elementary
students became sick. Since Friday, the illness has spread to junior and
senior high students as well as teachers and staff. Principal Erv
Weischedel has been sick since Monday, and the building's maintenance
director called in sick Tuesday, Johnson said. An additional 10 staff
members did not report Tuesday, and others were ill over the weekend.
Johnson said the district's maintenance staff will spend the next 3 days
disinfecting the school, checking the ventilation system and changing air
filters. The business manager is also looking into hiring a professional
cleaning firm, similar to those hired by hospitals.
Dave Zazac, spokesman for the Allegheny County Health Department, said the
illness has symptoms similar to those in a norovirus outbreak, including
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps. Some also suffer a low-grade
fever. Symptoms usually subside within 48 hours, but the person remains
contagious for three more days. He added that official confirmation cannot
happen until laboratory results are received from the state Department of
Health. The results are expected to be returned by Friday [26 Mar 2004].
Meanwhile, the department is looking to collect more biological samples
from students and adults infected by the virus. It is also monitoring the
possibility of secondary infections, or those who have become sick after
coming in contact with a previously infected person or contaminated
surface, Zazac said. For additional information and announcements, parents
can log on to the district's Web site at <http://www.cornell.k12.pa.us>.
"We were hoping this was slowly but surely going away, but it has gotten
worse," Johnson said. The Allegheny County Health Department and the
Centers for Disease Control suggest the following methods to help prevent
the stomach virus affecting the Cornell School District from spreading:
Frequently wash your hands, especially after toilet visits and before
eating or preparing food; carefully wash fruits and vegetables before
eating them; thoroughly clean and disinfect contaminated surfaces
immediately after an episode of illness by using a bleach-based household
cleaner.

USA: Norovirus Outbreak at the California Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas
---------------------------------------------------
The Clark County Health District today [Mon 22 Mar 2004] issued updated
totals for the number of gastrointestinal illness complaints pertaining to
a norovirus outbreak associated with the California Hotel and Casino in
Downtown Las Vegas. A team of communicable disease specialists from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention arrived in Las Vegas late
last week to assist the health district with its investigation into this
outbreak.
The health district is compiling the number of gastrointestinal illness
complaints from several sources: Boyd Gaming (corporate owner of the
California Hotel) security reports forwarded to the health district by the
company, direct public reports to the health district, hospital reports and
doctor's office reports. The numbers represent people who visited or stayed
at the California Hotel after 3 Dec 2003, and complained of becoming ill
with vomiting and/or diarrhea either during or immediately following their
visit.
Total Cases

13-19 Mar / 50 / 33 /
The norovirus outbreak associated with the California Hotel has peaked and
declined several times. The Clark County Health District Office of
Epidemiology will classify the current outbreak as over when a sustained
decline to baseline levels (an average of 2-3 illness complaints per week)
has been observed for a period of one month (the amount of time noroviruses
can survive on environmental surfaces).
Late last week, the health district received test results that indicated
the presence of norovirus in the stool of 3 ill people who recently stayed
or visited the California Hotel. 2 of the 3 samples were tested at the
Hawaii State Public Health Laboratory; one sample was tested at the Nevada
State Public Health Laboratory.
The health district reminds guests of any hotel to promptly report
incidents of illness to the hotel housekeeping or general staff. Areas
affected by vomiting and/or diarrhea must be properly cleaned and
disinfected to protect others from getting ill. Additionally, the health
district reminds ill persons they are considered infectious until 3 days
after their symptoms have resolved. Appropriate sanitation and personal
hygiene should be observed even after an ill person begins to feel better.
Additional information on noroviruses is available on the health district
web site at <http://www.cchd.org/download/epi/norovirus.pdf>
and on the CDC web site at

Portugal: Norovirus Outbreak in a School at Povoa do Varzim in the North
---------------------------------------------------
On 13 Jan 2004, the Autoridade de Saude (local health authority, LHA) of
Povoa do Varzim in the north of Portugal was informed that several children
and staff of a school had become ill with vomiting; diarrhoea was also
reported in some patients. The school had reopened on 5 Jan 2004 after the
usual Christmas holiday. The LHA visited the school on 14 Jan 2004, in
order to study and control the outbreak. This was the 1st time that a
norovirus outbreak in Portugal has been laboratory-confirmed, and the
timely intervention of the LHA allowed a thorough collection of data.
The school
----------
The school was a state school with 3 classes of children, each with its own
classroom and staff:
Group A (n=20): 17 children aged 3-5 years, 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary staff
members;
Group B (n=21): 20 children in grades 1 and 4 grades (ages 5-6 and 8-9
years) and one teacher;
Group C (n=17): 16 children in grades 2 and 3 (ages 6-7 and 7-8 years) and
one teacher; and
Group D (n=5): staff supporting all school groups: 3 auxiliary and 2
kitchen staff.
The LHA collected preliminary data and inspected the school premises. The
school's head teacher was interviewed and informed of the urgent need for
strict hygiene precautions and the exclusion from school of all symptomatic
children and staff until 48 hours after symptoms had gone.
Tap water and swab samples from 5 dishes were collected from the kitchen;
nasopharyngeal swabs and handwashes were collected from the 2 food
handlers. Faecal specimens from 3 cases were collected for analysis on 15
Jan 2004. The samples were tested at the Respiratory Virus and Enterovirus
Unit and the Food Microbiology Laboratory of the National Institute of Health.
Staff and the parents of all schoolchildren were interviewed (20 and 21 Jan
2004) using a structured questionnaire; questions about family members
(household contacts) were included. Those interviewed were asked to report
vomiting and/or diarrhoea occurring after the date of interview, until the
end of January 2004. Data was also collected on the consumption of meals at
the school. All persons reporting vomiting and/or watery diarrhoea that
began after 1 Jan 2004 were classified as cases.
Microbiological study
---------------------
Norovirus was identified in 2 of the 3 stool samples collected on 15 Jan
2004, using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
technique: case 15, a 49-year-old teacher of Group B; and case 23, an
8-year-old boy from Group C. Norovirus strains were sent to the Health
Protection Agency Enteric Virus Unit in England for characterisation and
were identified as belonging to genogroup II and similar to currently
circulating Grimsby/1995/UK strains (GII-4).
Tap water, dishes, and the hands of the kitchen staff tested negative for
coliforms, indicator organisms, and pathogens. Very small amounts of
_Staphylococcus aureus_ (not producing enterotoxins A-E) were isolated from
the nasopharyngeal swabs of both food handlers.
[At this point the text is supplemented by a figure illustrating the
duration of vomiting and/or diarrhoea and date of onset among school
members and household contacts.]
Epidemiology
------------
31 cases, with illness onset between 2-18 Jan 2004, were identified.
Reported symptoms were vomiting (87 percent), abdominal pain (68 percent),
nausea (58 percent), watery diarrhoea (52 percent), low-grade fever (42
percent), and myalgia (23 percent). All 4 patients who did not report
vomiting, reported watery diarrhoea. Most patients reported that the
disease was mild; 11 patients sought medical treatment but none was
admitted to hospital. Symptoms lasted from 1 to 12 days.
The overall attack rate in the school was 33 percent (21/63), and was
higher among staff members (60 percent = 6/10) than among schoolchildren
(28 percent = 15/53) (p=0.059; one tailed Fisher exact test). Neither of
the 2 food handlers reported symptoms. There were no statistically
significant (p=0.566) differences between attack rates in groups A, B, and
C. The attack rate (5 percent = 10/194) among household contacts (excluding
school members) was lower (p<0.001) than that reported among school members.
Most students and staff consumed meals in the school throughout the whole
period of the study. The menu was the same for everyone each day.
Most school cases (16/21) occurred in the first week after the reopening of
the school (5-11 Jan 2004), while most of the cases reported among
household contacts (9/10) began in the following week (12-18 Jan 2004).
A more detailed analysis of the questionnaires revealed some interesting
findings: (1) the first 2 cases, with onset on 2 Jan, were father and son
(aged 4 years, Group A); on 5 Jan the boy attended school while still
symptomatic; his sister, asymptomatic (aged 6 years, Group B), also
attended school; (2) cases 5 and 21, with dates of onset on 8 Jan, were
brothers aged 5 and 8 years (Groups A, C); (3) household contacts who
became ill on 13 and 18 Jan were daughter and mother, living with the
cousin/nephew (case 14) whose illness onset was 9 Jan (Group B); an
asymptomatic brother was also part of Group B; (4) the teacher of Group C
became ill on 10 Jan (case 24); 5 family members living with her became ill
on 12, 14 and 15 Jan; (5) the household contact with a date of onset on 12
Jan (case 11) was the brother (age 1 year) of an asymptomatic girl (age 5
years) of Group A; (6) vomiting episodes occurred in the classrooms and in
communal areas, such as the canteen; vomit was cleaned by auxiliary staff;
(7) from Monday to Friday (the school week, from 5-22 Jan), cases in staff
and schoolchildren accounted for 50 days of symptoms of vomiting and/or
watery diarrhoea (children were excluded from school for 14 of those days;
but not a single day of exclusion was reported in staff.
Discussion
----------
It is not likely that the outbreak was foodborne or waterborne. The rapid
spread and high attack rate may be explained by the faecal-oral and
airborne viral transmission from fomites (1). Outbreaks in schools have
already been described (2), and the potential for spreading the disease by
vomiting has also been reported previously (2,3). Case 2, who became ill on
2 Jan 2004, was a primary case. We can exclude neither the hypothesis that
case 12 (onset on 5 Jan 2004) was a co-primary case nor that the
asymptomatic sister of case 2 might have played a role in introducing the
virus into the school community. The disease spread inside each group and
outward to household contacts. We do not know what role asymptomatic cases
may have played in the spread of the outbreak, although asymptomatic cases
have been reported to have helped spread outbreaks elsewhere (4). The
higher attack rate among staff members is likely to be a result of the
higher number of personal contacts (mostly with children) within the
school. The difficulty of controlling person-to-person spread has been
documented, especially if symptoms include vomiting (5). We were able to
identify in detail the days on which each patient had symptoms; [the data
suggest] an increased probability of transmission within the school and
family environments throughout most of the duration of the outbreak.
Nevertheless, we do not know whether very poor compliance with exclusion
from school, especially before the visit of the LHA, is likely to have
played a role in the spread of the disease.
