The United States called on China on Monday [18 Jan 2021] to allow an expert team from the World Health Organization (WHO) to interview "care givers, former patients, and lab workers" in the central city of Wuhan and ensure its access to medical data and samples.

The team of WHO-led independent experts trying to determine the origins of the new coronavirus arrived on 14 Jan [2021] in Wuhan, where they are holding teleconferences with Chinese counterparts during a 2-week quarantine before starting work on the ground.

The United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of its initial outbreak, has called for a "transparent" WHO-led investigation and criticized the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts have done the 1st phase of research.

Garrett Grigsby of the US Department of Health and Human Services, said China should share all scientific studies into animal, human, and environmental samples taken in Wuhan, where the SARS-CoV-2 virus is believed to have emerged in late 2019. Comparative analysis of such genetic data would help to "look for overlap and potential sources" of the outbreak that sparked the COVID-19 pandemic, he told a session of the WHO's executive board due to last until 26 Jan [2021].

China's representative, however, told the board: "The virus origin studies are of a scientific nature. It needs coordination, cooperation. We must stop any political pressure."

Australia's delegation also called for the WHO team to have access to "relevant data, information, and key locations."

The medical virologist Prof Dominic Dwyer has barely been in China for 24 hours, but he has already joined several Zoom calls from his room in hotel quarantine, planning the logistics of an ambitious investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The World Health Organization selected Dwyer, a director at New South Wales Health Pathology in Australia, for the complex and politically fraught task, along with 14 other physicians, scientists, and researchers from around the world. Most of the team arrived in China on Thursday [14 Jan 2021] after months of intense diplomatic negotiations with Chinese authorities and setbacks to their entry.

As early as April 2020, countries including the US and Australia had called for the independent assessment of what happened before the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission first reported cases of pneumonia in December 2019, later identified as COVID-19. Wuhan, home to more than 11 million people, is the commercial hub and sprawling capital of central China's Hubei province.

"It's obviously very complex," Dwyer tells the Guardian. "There are scientific, medical, and political influences on all of this. But I think for this exercise, given that we're now really just past the 1st-year anniversary of the beginning of all of this . . . one of the most important tasks is the understanding of what hasn't been published, what those results are, and what needs to be done to get that information."

China initially rejected demands for the international investigation, before eventually approving a list of WHO experts to enter the country. In November [2020], a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said: "Although China was the 1st to report cases, it doesn't necessarily mean that the virus originated in China." In the same month [November 2020], Beijing amplified its criticisms of Australia, issuing a dossier of 14 key areas of dispute with the Australian government. The call for an independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 was among the list of grievances.

It is in this environment, and amid skepticism about how much access and information China will allow the WHO team, that the investigators' work in China has begun. But Dwyer says he does not feel uneasy.

"I think one of the features of these WHO missions is the people come in without their national viewpoints, biases, or the politics," he says. "That's one of the advantages of WHO. As an international organisation, it's not about where you're from. I think that's an important way to dampen down political aspects of one country versus another.

"It is very early days, but everyone has been unfailingly polite, welcoming, and friendly in obviously constrained circumstances. I'd be surprised if anybody said 'Oh, you're Australian, we're not going to talk to you.' It doesn't work that way. And that's why it's disappointing when leaders in some countries decide they don't want to fund WHO.

"You need these international organisations precisely to get over the blame game, the politics, and the country-versus-country type stuff."

The WHO team were chosen for expertise in one of 3 key areas, Dwyer says: animal health and animal viruses; human viral infections and transmission; and epidemiology and public health.

As well as his work in pathology, the 64-year-old is a physician at Westmead hospital in Sydney, where he trained in microbiology, virology, and infectious diseases. His specialism is HIV/AIDS, and he was involved in the treatment of some of Australia's 1st patients with that virus.

Fluent in French, he undertook postgraduate research at the renowned Institute Pasteur in Paris in the laboratory of Luc Montagnier, who in 2008 was awarded the Nobel prize in medicine alongside Francoise Barre-Sinoussi for their discovery of HIV. Dwyer has worked with the WHO before, spending 6 months in Beijing in 2003 at the height of the SARS outbreak as China locked down the capital and closed thousands of public places.

"To see a city of that size in complete lockdown, with everything shut, everyone in a panic, was really quite remarkable, and in fact quite a good learning exercise for SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19]."

He has trained people in laboratories in the Philippines and Singapore and worked with the Australian government in 2005 to manage the threat of H5N1, more commonly called "bird flu," in Viet Nam. Dwyer says one of the WHO team's 1st tasks when their quarantine ends on 25 Jan [2020] will be speaking with laboratory assistants, scientists, and physicians in China.

"That face-to-face contact is important," he says. "They're the people actually involved at the coalface, and they may well have a different view, or different findings, to what might be presented at a higher level. My experience with SARS and other things is that when you get to talk to your peer group, they, too, want to find out what's going on; they don't want things to be unknown, hidden, or uncertain."

There is evidence that suggests the virus jumped from a natural reservoir, such as bats, to an intermediary animal host, possibly triggering an outbreak among animals in the Wuhan wet market. In humans, the virus was first identified in people who worked at or visited the market. Visiting the wet market will be key, Dwyer says. Access was not granted to a small team of WHO officials when they first went to China to investigate the outbreak in February last year [2020].

"Getting an understanding of the physical layout of that market, even if it's closed, is important, because the very preliminary information to date on the market shows a layout over a very large area, and there were parts of the market that had appeared to have a lot of cases of COVID while other parts didn't," Dwyer says.

"Why was that? And how does the market physically interact with other parts of the city? How do people work there? All of those sorts of things you can do on the ground."

Could it be that despite their efforts, the work of the WHO team over the coming weeks may lead to interesting findings that nonetheless never reveal how and where the virus first infected humans?

"I think that's true," Dwyer says. "It may be that we never find virus zero. But I think the important thing then becomes how did it move from those very few patients in the market and then into the city, then the rest of China and the rest of the world?

"Now of course it doesn't mean that the outbreak actually started in Wuhan. We know the market was the amplifying event. But there were cases before then. So where were those early cases from? Were they in people travelling to work in Wuhan, or have animals travelled to Wuhan?

"It's an easy assumption just to say, 'It's all in Wuhan.' But I think information from before then, about the early movement of the virus in people before it really got going, is perhaps going to be the most interesting, and indeed difficult, part."

[The terms of reference for the WHO experts mission to China have been included in the document "WHO-convened Global Study of the Origins of SARS-CoV-2: Terms of References for the China Part." The document (9 pages, including 19 references) is available at https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-convened-global-study-of-the-origins-of-sars-cov-2.

Its chapter "Current knowledge supporting origin tracing work," sub-chapter "The early cluster in Wuhan" (pages 5-6), includes the following:

"The early cases in Wuhan are thought to have occurred in early December [2019], and preliminary information from surveillance data of severe pneumonia suggest no unusual cluster or departure from trends in the weeks and months preceding the 1st reported case in Wuhan.

"Retrospective review of cases identified a total of 124 confirmed cases with onset date in December 2019, 119 of whom were from Wuhan and 5 others from Hubei or other provinces, but all with travel links to Wuhan during the period of exposure. A study of 41 initially identified confirmed cases showed that 70% of the cases had a link to the Huanan market (Huang, et al., 2020), but detailed exposure factors within the market and elsewhere remain unclear.

"The Huanan wholesale market is a large market (653 stalls and more than 1180 employees) mainly supplying seafood products but also fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, and live animals. In late December 2019, 10 stalls operators were trading live wild animals including chipmunks, foxes, racoons, wild boar, giant salamanders, hedgehogs, sika deer, among others. Farmed, wild, and domestic animals were also traded at the market including snakes, frogs, quails, bamboo rats, rabbits, crocodiles, and badgers. The market was closed on 1 Jan 2020, and several investigations followed, including environmental sampling in the market, as well as sampling of frozen animal carcasses at the market. Of the 336 samples collected from animals, none were PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2, whereas 69 out of 842 environmental samples were positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2; 61 of those (88%) were from the western wing of the market. Of these, 22 samples were from 8 different drains and sewage, and 3 viruses were isolated, sequenced, and shared on GISAID. These were virtually identical to the patient samples collected at the same time (exceeding 99.9 % homology).

"In the absence of analytical epidemiological study among vendors and shoppers, and without detailed mapping of exposure factors at the market over the exposure period, type of products, and animals sold, the proportion of animals and commodities that were available for testing, interpreting laboratory sampling results remains difficult.

"As such, it remains unclear whether the market was a contamination source, acted as an amplifier for human-to-human transmission, or a combination of those factors. In addition, there is limited information about potential risk factors outside of the market, such as occupation, travel history, or other[s which] were identified among the 1st diagnosed cases. A better understanding of potential risk factors through in-depth epidemiological investigations is critical in orienting the nature and geographic focus of other studies. For example, if the market acted primarily as a common source of contamination through animal or non-animal products, the focus of subsequent studies should be on source tracing of such products, whereas if evidence points towards the market as enabler of human-to-human transmission, source tracing would need to focus elsewhere.

"No unusual clusters of cases or deaths were reported elsewhere in China prior to detecting the cases in Wuhan, and clinical surveillance of farmed animals since 2019 have shown no departure from trends.

Overall, very little is currently known about how, where, and when the virus started circulation in Wuhan. Preliminary studies have not generated credible leads to narrow the area of research, and studies will therefore focus on developing comprehensive study plans to help generate hypotheses on how the outbreak may have started in Wuhan."

Strikingly, to the best of our knowledge, so far not a single test of samples collected on the Huanan wholesale market from a living animal has become available. The apparent disappearance of the animals led ProMED to publish, repeatedly, the following request for information (initially, in 20200210.6972104):

1. Which (domestic/wildlife) animal species are known to have been present in the market on 31 Dec 2019 and/or 1 Jan 2020?
2. What was the fate of the animals above? In case killed, details on the mode of disposal and quantitative data are requested.
3. Was sampling of (any of) the market's animals, in vivo/in vitro, performed?
4. In case sampled, which lab tests have been applied? If affirmed, results, per species, negative included, are requested.
5. Were the (state/local) Veterinary Services involved throughout the procedures above?

A response, in particular to questions 2-5, is pending.

The alarming public health situation that emerged in Wuhan in late December 2019 prescribed application of the most severe control measures in the Huanan market, regarded -- at that time -- as the hub of the epidemic.

According to traditional animal health criteria for the control of a rapidly spreading animal pathogen, such measures include a declaration of 'standstill' of the affected animal population while naming the species involved. The movement prohibition allows the immediate exercising of control measures such as clinical inspections of the animals, their sampling, testing, and -- if required -- stamping out (culling, incineration, and disinfection) or, if available, vaccination "in response to an outbreak." A typical example is the handling of foot-and-mouth disease in a non-endemic country.

The power to exercise such measures, anywhere, is derived from the country's primary legislation. In its various countries' versions, such piece of legislation usually defines the authorized "veterinary officers," "animal owners," (lists of) "reportable animal diseases," and "animal species," etc. It also identifies the highest relevant state authority (mostly, a State Minister) who bears the responsibility to publish secondary legislation (rules and directives) in specified subjects. These subjects have traditionally been related, globally, to the protection of animal health (including zoonoses).

Were the Chinese veterinary authorities empowered, in the case of the Huanan market, to act as professionally required? The legislation issue deserves being checked, in China as well as elsewhere. In most countries, such a situation would have, at present, become similarly precarious. In Wuhan, the issue was public health. There was no named "animal disease"; the animal species present on the affected premises were not known, or, in case known, were they listed? Have the animals, in the absence of authority to act (or of timely action), escaped examination, sampling, testing, and possibly culling?

To remedy such lacune in the veterinary/animal health legislation, if present, in China or elsewhere, it is suggested to consider the inclusion, in main legislations, of a clause in resemblance to and spirit of the following: "The (Minister) may make rules prescribing and regulating any examination, treatment, disinfection, seizure, transfer, detainment, removal, killing or destruction of animals, animal products, or carcasses, due to which the risk of damage to the health of human beings exists." - Mod.AS
