FDA is working closely with CDC and the state of California. FDA has
determined that the spinach implicated in the outbreak was grown in 3
counties (Monterey, San Benito and Santa Clara) in California.
Spinach grown in the rest of the USA has not been implicated in the
current _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak. The public can be confident that
spinach grown in the non-implicated areas can be consumed. Other
produce grown in these counties is not implicated in this outbreak.
Processed spinach (e.g., frozen and canned spinach) is also not
implicated in this outbreak.
Industry is working to get spinach from areas not implicated in the
current _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak back on the market.
Investigators from FDA, CDC and the state of California are working
to narrow the area implicated in the current _E. coli_ O157:H7
outbreak further.
Case Reports:
To date, 166 cases of illness due to _E. coli_ infection have been
reported to the CDC, including 27 cases of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome
(HUS), 88 hospitalizations and 1 death. Illnesses continue to be
reported to CDC. This is considered to be an ongoing investigation.
States Affected:
The 25 affected states (newly listed are Maryland and Tennessee) are:
Arizona (4), California (1), Colorado (1), Connecticut (3) Idaho (4),
Illinois (1), Indiana (8), Kentucky (8), Maine (3), Maryland (3),
Michigan (4), Minnesota (2), Nebraska (8), Nevada (1), New Mexico
(5), New York (11), Ohio (20), Oregon (5), Pennsylvania (8),
Tennessee (1), Utah (17), Virginia (2), Washington (3), Wisconsin
(2), and Wyoming (1).

[Since the FDA report the previous day, there have been 6 more
overall cases included and 5 more hospitalizations with no additional
complications of HUS or death. ProMED's previous posting noted 2
other deaths have not yet been linked formally to the outbreak.
Maryland and Tennessee are now represented among now 25 states.
FDA has also now stated that non-California fresh spinach can be
consumed. - Mod.LL]

Less than 24 hours after the FDA said it is safe to eat spinach grown
outside of California's Salinas Valley, the Savoy spinach industry is
working to make sure wholesalers, retailers and consumers know its
product is grown in the near west, southeast and northeast USA. Savoy
spinach, also known as curly leaf spinach, is used by restaurants
throughout the USA, but many consumers are not aware of the
alternative to flat leaf spinach.
In addition to being grown outside of California, Savoy spinach is
also handled differently than the flat leaf spinach that was found to
contain _E. coli_ [O157:H7], spurring the ban on all spinach sales
late last week. Once harvested, Savoy spinach is placed in highly
sophisticated, ice-packed, sanitized containers designed specifically
to handle Savoy spinach as it is sent to re-packers in the produce
industry.
