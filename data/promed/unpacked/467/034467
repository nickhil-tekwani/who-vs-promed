The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that 3 children
outside Viet Nam have died after receiving vaccinations from 2
batches of hepatitis B vaccine produced by Korea's LG company.
On Wed 23 May 2007, Dr. Cao Minh Quang, Deputy Minister of Health,
quoted a WHO announcement that 6 children in the world have died so
far after being vaccinated from 2 batches of hepatitis B vaccine of
LG, coded UVX 05028 and UVX 06006. Of the 6 children, 3 died in Viet
Nam, 2 in the Philippines and one in Bangladesh. Dr. Quang said that
this was a very rare catastrophe occurring in vaccination programs in
the world.
According to Dr. Do Si Hien, Chairman of the national expanded
vaccination program, the representative of the WHO in Viet Nam said
that they would contact WHO headquarters in Switzerland to verify the
information and officially inform the Vietnamese Health Ministry
today, Thu 24 May 2007.
A mission of the WHO is now working in the Republic of Korea to
inspect the hepatitis B production line of LG.

The World Health Organization is investigating 3 child deaths in
connection with the use of a South Korean-made hepatitis B vaccine in
the Philippines and Bangladesh, a Vietnamese official said Wed 23 May
2007. The children had died after receiving shots of LG Life
Sciences' Euvax B vaccine from the same lots as those suspected to
have caused 3 deaths in Viet Nam this month [May 2007], Deputy Health
Minister Cao Minh Quang said.
Drugs from the suspected lots had been shipped to 24 countries
through a UN system, according to WHO. Viet Nam has suspended the use
of the [vaccine], a move supported by WHO, which also recommended the
temporary suspension of specific lots of the vaccine worldwide. Two
WHO experts have joined their Vietnamese counterparts in investing
the case since last week. Quang said Viet Nam would soon build its
1st lab to test vaccine quality.

[Hepatitis B vaccine is an inherently safe vaccine that, up to the
present, has been used worldwide in recipients of all ages without
incident. It is likely that this incident is vaccine-batch related
and does not indicate a systemic deficiency in the vaccine. Further
information from WHO is awaited. - Mod.CP]
[While it is unclear if a definite causal association between the
deaths and the receipt of the vaccine, it is prudent that the lots of
vaccine involved be withheld from administration. What is also
unclear is whether there has been active case finding in all of the
24 countries that received vaccine from the suspected lots. - Mod.MPP
