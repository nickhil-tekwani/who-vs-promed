Benguet State University [and partners have] documented the infestation of fusarium wilt on sweet potatoes. Since 2012, an 'attack' [has] escalated to the present day wiping out this crop.

Distribution of clean planting materials from Northern Phil Rootcrops Research and training Center (NPRCRTC) is an attempt to provide [an] initial solution. [A] continuing project will [per]form a systematic survey and document the spread and magnitude of infestation in the region.

[Fusarium wilt of sweet potato is caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_ (Fo; previously f.sp. _batatas_ or _nicotianae_). Symptoms may include leaf yellowing, wilting of the shoot, discolouration of vascular bundles, stunting of plants, stem cracking, premature flowering and root necrosis. Disease distribution may be patchy across a field. In some cases, other _Fusarium_ species may also be present and contribute to the disease. Fo can also cause root rot, stem canker and surface rot of the crop (previously attributed to different f.sp.). Infection usually occurs via wounds, for example during propagation or harvest.

The fungus can survive in soil for many years. It is soil borne and can also be spread with contaminated plant materials (cuttings for propagation, plant debris), contaminated tools, water and by mechanical means (including human activities). Disease management may include fungicide dips for propagation material, phytosanitation, soil solarisation (to destroy conidia) and use of certified clean planting material. Resistant or tolerant sweet potato varieties are available for some areas.

Different strains of _F. oxysporum_ cause wilting diseases with serious losses in many crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits and vegetables.
