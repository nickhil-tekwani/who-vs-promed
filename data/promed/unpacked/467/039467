The posting based on BBC Online, 3 Apr 2001:
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/health/newsid_1258000/1258203.stm>
disseminated by ProMED-mail [posting cited above is wrong to some extent.
Although the data given in the news were [provided by an Austrian
infection control team (Watschinger and colleagues) participating in the
11th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases
(ECCMID, Istanbul, Turkey, 1-4 Apr 2001), they presented the data from
their own hospitals, not from Istanbul hospitals (poster #1051).
Another item which should be corrected is that the flasks (more correctly,
Thermos bottles) from which multiresistant Acinetobacter strains have been
isolated were used not "to deliver" tea to the patients but to keep the tea
warm before using it "to rinse" the gastric tubes of intensive care patients.

[Dr Eraksoy is correct. The BBC article posted was misleading, and I
concluded from the wording that an Austrian team had been participating in
an epidemiological survey in Istanbul. The data are indeed derived from
Austrian hospitals but were presented at the ECCMID meeting in Istanbul.
The abstract cited also clearly refers to tea delivered for rinsing gastric
tubes, not for direct consumption by patients. The BBC article even
featured a picture of a patient's food tray with a pot of tea to illustrate
the erroneous interpretation. - Mod.ES
