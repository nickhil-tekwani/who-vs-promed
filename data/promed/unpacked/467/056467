[The above immediate notification, submitted nearly 5 months after the apparent "start of the outbreak" namely the day of import of 150 (apparently, clinically healthy) cattle from Germany to Bosnia-Herzegovina, 3 of which were found BT seropositive upon arrival, is puzzling; does such an event deserve the title "outbreak?!"

It would be interesting to test the positive sera for the BTV serotype involved, to trace back the 3 positive animals to their precise farms of origin, and to carry out a thorough investigation in order to definitely exclude the possibility that they were vaccinated.

Since the event is termed "continuing" and no culling is reported, can it be assumed that the 3 seropositive animals are still there?... - Mod.AS]

National sanitary veterinary and food safety authority (NSVFSA): Bluetongue in Romania, Sep 2014
-----
1. Background
- BTV never occurred in Romania.
- The serological surveillance was enforced since 2000.
- The entomological surveillance was enforced since 2005. There were identified the vectors belonging to _C. obsoletus_, _C. pulicaris_ complexes and _C. nubeculosus_ species.
- The vector-free period usually starts in November and lasts by the end of April.
- In September 2008, a part of Romanian territory was involved in the surveillance zone due to an outbreak of bluetongue (BTV 8) that occurred on the Hungarian territory.
- In April 2009, Romania reported the results of the monitoring actions carried out in the surveillance area for bluetongue and asked for the lifting of the restriction measures.

2. Current situation
Actions taken for prevention of introducing BT in Romania in the context of the evolution of disease within the Greece and Bulgarian territory (before the 1st outbreak occurrence):
- Sending the daily alerts to all counties for informing and alerting;
- Instructions sent to all counties for informing and enhancing the surveillance and the movement control measures;
- Risk analysis on 5 Aug 2014 concerning the risk factors of BTV4 for Romania and measures to be applied, posted on NSVFSA site for public information;
- On 7 Aug 2014, meeting of the National Experts Group for BT;
- Instructions sent to all counties with measures to be urgently implemented;
- Cooperation with the General Inspectorate of the Border Police for helping the veterinary services in checking the [designations] of the consignments provided from restricted areas of Bulgaria/Greece territory.

3. The 1st outbreak
1st cases occurred in bovine animals, in South-East of Romania, at altitude 1000 meters
- The County Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Directorate Buzau (CSVFSD) was announced about a suspicion of BTV in one holding, in the morning of 21 Aug 2014, by the empowered veterinarian;
- A team of epidemiologist from the local authority went to the place of suspicion, inspected the animals, which showed clinical signs (mouth, udder and foot lesions), sampled 2 animals, and then sent those samples to the Local Sanitary Veterinary Laboratory;
- The animals have shown signs of disease since 14 Aug 2014, and were treated for other reasons, but, in the end, they were suspected of BT.
- During the same day, 21 Aug 2014, another 15 suspected backyards were notified to local veterinary office;
- animals were sampled and also sent to Local Sanitary Veterinary Laboratory for analyzing by serology, through ELISA;
- On 22 Aug 2014, all samples tested were positive to the ELISA test.
- The samples were sent on 22 Aug 2014 for confirmation to the National Reference Laboratory -- Institute for Diagnostic and Animal Health -- to be tested for virus genome identification by Real Time RT-PCR;
- The disease was confirmed in all those 16 backyard (22 animals) on 23 Aug 2014;
- An epidemiological investigation has been performed, and the findings were that the primary outbreak might be considered a holding from the locality Sarulesti; the presumptive date of infection was established to be 10-11 Aug, 2014.
- Clinical signs: hyperthermia, hyperemia, congestion and erosions of the skin and mucosae, especially oral mucosa; salivation, epiphora, nasal discharge;
- Blood samples were sent to EURL for bluetongue at Pirbright on 27 Aug 2014;
- The BTV serotype identified BTV 4 (confirmed by the Pirbright Reference Laboratory on 1 Sep 2014);
- The affected animals are cattle and sheep.

5. Evolution of cases, as for 8 Sep 2014 [these figures have significantly changed since. - Mod.AS].

Total (17 counties): 184 outbreaks; 447 cases; died: 7 cattle, 40 sheep; culled - 3 cattle.

6. Measures enforced
The measures were set according to the relevant legislation provisions (the Council Directive 2000/75/EC and the EC Reg. 1266/2007) and the opinion of the National Experts Group for bluetongue:
- demarcation of the restricted zones (20, 100 and 150 km restriction zones around outbreaks) taking into account the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains and the wind direction according to the data received from the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (see map);
- ban of movement of all susceptible ruminant animals according to the legislation in force;
- closing the markets and fairs until 5 Oct 2014 on the entire Romanian territory.
- the movement of susceptible animals from the restricted zones is made according to the EC Reg. 1266/2007 and the national legislation in force;
- the suspicious holdings are placed under sanitary veterinary surveillance;
- census of susceptible animals;
- clinical inspections of holdings with susceptible animals, performed by the official veterinarian;
- recommended destroying the favorable biotopes for culicoides and treatments with insecticides and repellents;
- passive and active surveillance (sampling for serological and virological testing for BT);
- entomological surveillance (collection and counting of culicoides);
- according to the Surveillance programme for 2014, the entomological activities were reduced, being close to the minimum requirements foreseen in Reg. 1266/2007;
- weekly catches in April and November 2014; monthly catches in winter months;
- following the bluetongue situation in Bulgaria, the entomological surveillance was intensified with monthly catches by means of fixed traps in all counties, and weekly catches by means of mobile traps in restricted zones, as a result of disease outbreak in our country;
- most of the counties reported, so far, culicoid vectors in their traps: _C. obsoletus_, _C. pulicaris_ and _C. nubeculosus_. The number of culicoids trapped was low, but more catches are needed in order to draw a conclusion on vector abundance, at least at the trap location;
- warning campaigns for farmers and large public;
- symptomatic treatment of affected animals;
- the measure of killing of affected animals is not applied;
- all outbreaks are accordingly notified to the European Commission, and to OIE.

In the counties situated outside of restricted zones, [the following measures] are performed:
- passive surveillance;
- active serological surveillance according to provisions of Reg. (EC) 1266/2007;
- entomological surveillance by monthly catches;
- control of animals movement according to Reg. (EC) 1266/2007 provisions.

As a result, no cases of BT were recorded in the counties from outside of the restricted zones [an update will be helpful; no follow-up reports from Romania to OIE since 11 Sep 2014. - Mod.AS].

7. Future approach
- NSVFSA Scientific Council took place on 3 Sep 2014 for analyzing the BTV situation in Romania and for discussing the actions to be implemented in the future;
- They concluded that the occurrence of the new outbreaks could be possible in the next period [see comment];
- As an eradication measure, the vaccination of all susceptible animals on Romania's territory could be taken into consideration for the next spring;
- BTV vaccination for commercial cattle farms could be applied even this year [2014], voluntarily as requested by professional farmers.

[The BTV epizootic has been signified by its rapid spread and by the exceptionally high incidence in cattle, compared to other regional countries where sheep were the predominantly affected species. Both issues deserve clarification. Romania is expected to submit an updated follow-up report.

On 19 Sep 2014, Greece and Turkey have submitted to the OIE BT follow-up reports. Greece has reported 24 new outbreaks [for the follow-up report, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=15841].

Turkey reports "no additional cases." The disease was reportedly restricted to Turkey's European province, Kirklareli, where its spread was arrested by the immediate application of vaccination of sheep. Reportedly, 340 000 head have been vaccinated. For the follow-up report, see
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=16102.

OIE's interactive world maps showing BT outbreaks reported during 2014, where each country can be zoomed in on, are available at:
BT in sheep: http://tinyurl.com/kdcu9y5;
BT in cattle: http://tinyurl.com/k9t2uq6.

The epizootic, caused by BTV-4, probably of West African origin, started its spread in southern Greece in May 2014. It is suspected to circulate also in Maghreb counties. Vaccination has been undertaken only in Turkey.

Bluetongue, a vector borne disease caused by an orbivirus, is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
