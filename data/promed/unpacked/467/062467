The CFIA and Canada Safeway are warning the public not to consume the
fresh and frozen ground beef products listed below because the
products may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.
The following products are affected by this alert:
1. Fresh ground beef (lean, regular, extra lean and market trim)
The fresh ground beef products were sold at Safeway and some
independent grocery stores in British Columbia and Alberta between 24
May and 5 Jun 2007 and bear Best Before dates from 25 May to 6 Jun
2007 inclusively.
Consumers who have purchased fresh ground beef products from
independent stores during the time periods described above and who
are unsure whether they are affected products should contact the
retail store to determine whether the product purchased is affected.
2. Butcher's Cut frozen ground beef patties 1.13 kg
The affected patties, bearing UPC 58200 21604 and a Julian code date
of 143, were sold on and after 24 May 2007 at Safeway stores in
Western Canada and in Ontario, west of Thunder Bay.
3. Sunny Dawn frozen ground beef patties
The affected patties, bearing Julian date 143-07, were sold on or
after 24 May 2007 at some independent grocery stores in Western
Canada, Yukon, Northwest Territories, and in Ontario west of Thunder Bay.

them in their freezers are advised not to consume these products.

Five people in Alberta and British Columbia have become ill after
eating _E. coli_-contaminated ground beef products sold at Safeway
and some independent stores, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said.
None of the people who got sick from the contaminated meat are from
the Edmonton area, Capital Health spokeswoman Helen Wu said.
"Our warning is quite straightforward," Davendra Sharma, a CFIA food
safety recall specialist, said in an interview. "If you have any of
these products, do not consume them."
Sharma said consumers may still have packages of this ground beef in
their freezers or may have shaped the beef into patties before
freezing for later use.

[Many recalls of ground beef and other food vehicles occur related to
_E. coli_ O157:H7 contamination. This recall is posted because,
unlike many others, it is associated with human cases.
The most important line in the posting relates to the need for
adequately cooking ground beef. The meat is certainly not sterile,
and bacteria will persist in under-cooked areas. This is especially
true for organisms like _E. coli_ O157:H7 that require only a small
number of ingested bacteria to cause disease.
Hints to prevent this illness related to ground beef can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/escherichiacoli_g.htm#What%20can%20be%20done%20to%20prevent%20the%20infection>,
and include:
1. Because ground beef can turn brown before disease-causing bacteria
are killed, use a digital instant-read meat thermometer to ensure
thorough cooking. Ground beef should be cooked until a thermometer
inserted into several parts of the patty, including the thickest
part, reads at least 160 F (71 C). Persons who cook ground beef
without using a thermometer can decrease their risk of illness by not
eating ground beef patties that are still pink in the middle.
2. If you are served an under-cooked hamburger or other ground beef
product in a restaurant, send it back for further cooking. You may
want to ask for a new bun and a clean plate, too.
3. Avoid spreading harmful bacteria in your kitchen. Keep raw meat
separate from ready-to-eat foods. Wash hands, counters, and utensils
with hot soapy water after they touch raw meat. Never place cooked
hamburgers or ground beef on the unwashed plate that held raw
patties. Wash meat thermometers in between tests of patties that
require further cooking.
