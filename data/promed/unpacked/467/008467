Vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine against COVID-19 was 91% up to 6 months after the 2nd dose, according to a non-peer-reviewed study published yesterday [28 Jul 2021] on the preprint server medRxiv [see citation below].

The researchers followed 44 060 people 16 and older, randomly assigning half to receive 2 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and half to a placebo. Most of the 152 recruitment sites were in the United States (130), followed by Turkey (9), Germany (6), and South Africa (4). The study also followed 2260 US children 12-15 years old, with half receiving the intervention and half receiving placebo.

VE was 91.1% up to 6 months after the 2nd vaccine dose, regardless of previous COVID-19 infection (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.0 to 93.2). Against severe disease it was 97% (95% CI, 80.3% to 99.9%).

When the researchers looked at VE across age, sex, race, or COVID-19 risk factors, VE was always 86% or higher, although they note that youth data was not available for 6 months because of when enrollment began (15 Oct 2020, vs 27 Jul 2020, for adults). VE peaked at 96.2% from 7 days to less than 2 months after the 2nd dose, but at 4 months it declined to 83.7%, with an average decline of 6% every 2 months.

More vaccine recipients reported local and systemic events than placebo recipients, with mild-to-moderate injection-site pain and fatigue being the most common, respectively. People who had COVID-19 prior to vaccination reported more systemic reactions after the 1st dose, whereas those who were naive to COVID-19 reported more systemic reactions after the 2nd. While 15 vaccine recipients and 14 placebo recipients died, none of the deaths were considered related to the intervention.

Because reactogenicity events among participants not in the reactogenicity subset were reported as adverse events, the researchers say that the data show imbalances toward the Pfizer group (30% vs 14% for adverse events, 24% vs 6% for related adverse events, and 1.2% vs 0.7% for severe adverse events).

"Despite a gradually declining trend in vaccine efficacy, BNT162b2 had a favorable safety profile and was highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19," the researchers conclude.

In a longitudinal cohort of 25 children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), all were asymptomatic and at their functional baseline at 6-month follow-up, according to a Pediatrics study yesterday [28 Jul 2021] [see citation below]. The study included a total of 50 children, with some lost to follow-up, but during all intermediary follow-ups, symptoms were improving.

All study participants were admitted to Cohen Children's Medical Center with MIS-C from 17 Apr-20 Jun 2020 (median age, 8.5 years; range, 9 months-17 years). Most patients exhibited rapid clinical improvement, with an average hospital stay of 5 days. At discharge, 69% of 26 patients with left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction had resumed normal function, 15% had persistent but improved dysfunction, and 15% had mild dysfunction at admission but no available discharge data.

At 2 weeks, 47 presented for follow-up, and 47% said they got tired with ordinary activities, most of whom (81.8%) experienced shock or myocardial systolic dysfunction at initial admission. All other patients were asymptomatic. Platelet levels were elevated compared with admission (median, 463 000 cells per microliter vs 172 000), but all other markers had normalized. Some LV systolic (one patient) and diastolic (5) function persisted.

The follow-up at 8 weeks involved 42 people, with 5 (12%) continuing to experience fatigue during regular activity. All LV systolic function was normal, and any remaining coronary aneurysms and dilation had resolved. However, 4 (9%) still had diastolic dysfunction, and 5 (12%) had qualitative coronary abnormalities.

By 6 months, the 25 available patients were asymptomatic and at their functional baselines. Despite being asymptomatic, one patient still had LV diastolic dysfunction, but cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at 8 weeks didn't show inflammation or fibrosis.

"Early and mid-term prognosis after hospitalization and immunomodulation treatment for MIS-C is excellent with return to functional baseline, normalized LV systolic function, and resolved coronary abnormalities. However, persistence of diastolic dysfunction in a few patients confounds our understanding of MIS-C," write the researchers.

[3] Israel: breakthrough infections
Date: Thu 29 Jul 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/israeli-study-finds-26-covid-breakthrough-infection-rate-0


A New England Journal of Medicine study yesterday [28 Jul 2021] details breakthrough COVID-19 infections in 39 of 1497 fully vaccinated Israeli healthcare workers, with most cases mild or moderate, but 19% with symptoms lingering for more than 6 weeks [see citation below].

A team led by Tel Aviv University researchers used diagnostic testing, antibody assays, genomic sequencing, and contact tracing to evaluate healthcare workers who were symptomatic or had been exposed to an infected person.

All workers had received a 2nd dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 11 days before the study began on 20 Jan [2021]. The study ran for 14 weeks, during which time Israel experienced its 3rd and largest COVID-19 case surge.

The researchers also matched workers with COVID-19 and antibody concentrations obtained within a week before diagnosis with 4 or 5 uninfected controls and used generalized estimating equations to predict average antibody levels and the ratio between the levels in the 2 groups.

In total, 2.6% of the healthcare workers had breakthrough COVID-19 infections, 67% of which were mild and 33% of which were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were upper respiratory congestion (36%), muscle pain (28%), loss of smell or taste (28%), and fever or chills (21%).

"In this study, we found that although the [Pfizer] vaccine is extremely effective, rare breakthrough infections carry an infectious potential and create a special challenge, since such infections are often asymptomatic and may pose a risk to vulnerable populations," the researchers wrote.

[A total of] 31% of infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days after their diagnosis, and 19% reported "long COVID" symptoms of loss of smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, or muscle pain for more than 6 weeks. None were hospitalized. Of the 23% of workers who took a leave of absence from work for more than the mandatory 10-day quarantine, 4 returned to work within 2 weeks, and one still hadn't returned after 6 weeks.

The alpha (B117) SARS-CoV-2 variant, which was dominant in Israel at the time, was identified in 85% of tested samples. Of all workers, 74% had a high viral load (cycle threshold [Ct] value less than 30) at some point during their illness, suggesting contagiousness. No secondary infections were identified, which the researchers said suggests that the infected workers were less contagious than their unvaccinated peers.

The workers had lower neutralizing antibody levels in the week before diagnosis (peri-infection period) than did matched controls (case-to-control ratio, 0.361). Higher antibody levels were linked with lower infectivity (higher cycle threshold values).

"Among fully vaccinated healthcare workers, the occurrence of breakthrough infections with SARS-CoV-2 was correlated with neutralizing antibody titers during the peri-infection period," the authors wrote.

The likely source of COVID-19 infection in all 37 healthcare workers with available data was an unvaccinated person, which was a household member in 57% of the cases. In 30% of cases, the suspected source was an unvaccinated fellow healthcare worker or patient, of which 7 of 11 were linked to a single hospital outbreak involving an unvaccinated index patient who had been receiving noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation before being diagnosed as having the alpha variant.

Of the total cohort, 46% were nursing staff members, 26% worked in administration or maintenance, 15% were allied health professionals, and 13% were physicians. Average age was 42 years, 64% were women, and only one person was immunosuppressed. The median interval between the 2nd vaccine dose and COVID-19 diagnosis was 39 days.

The authors said that the results are important to predicting how the expected decay of SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels after vaccination will affect clinical COVID-19 outcomes, whether a booster dose will be needed, and whether vaccinated people are protected. "Such capacity for prediction is particularly important for new vaccine development," they wrote.

["With delta, almost everyone who dies from COVID-19 -- 99.5% of known cases -- are unvaccinated people, along with 97% of people hospitalized for the illness. That suggests that the vaccines are still highly effective, said US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy during a recent press briefing."

"In the US, no one knows exactly how many breakthrough cases there really are because nationwide data doesn't exist. The agency [the CDC] does not count vaccinated people who have been diagnosed with the disease but are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. That's problematic, he said, because the way researchers count infections among vaccinated people is vital to investigating this continually evolving virus, he said.

"'One of the most critical questions is how much forward-transmission is happening from breakthrough infections,' Jha said. 'That's something I don't feel like we have a good grip on and is absolutely essential to understand.'

"These are really important questions, and it is really difficult to answer them without data, Wen said, who added that, 'we need to understand what we're dealing with here.'

"The risk of a breakthrough infection for vaccinated people with symptoms upon exposure to the delta variant is reduced by 7-fold, and that reduction is 20-fold for hospitalizations and death, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who directs the CDC, said Tuesday [27 Jul 2021].

"However, the CDC does track cohorts of fully vaccinated essential workers, including those in the health-care and long-term-care industries, to better understand how protective vaccines are. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical advisor, told PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff on Tuesday [27 Jul 2021] that, from those cohorts, they are seeing data showing that fully vaccinated people who get infected 'clearly can transmit it to other people.'"

[4] Israel vaccine advisory group: boosters
Date: Thu 29 Jul 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/israeli-advisors-back-covid-vaccine-boosters-older-people


Israel's vaccine advisory group today [29 Jul 2021] recommended that adults in older age groups receive a booster COVID dose, a strategy that other countries are eyeing as delta (B1617.2) variant activity surges and questions swirl about the length of vaccine protection.

Many global health experts have criticized countries for considering booster doses, given that health workers and at-risk groups in many low- and middle-income countries have not received their 1st doses and that the science isn't clear about the need for the boosters. Meanwhile, African officials today said vaccine deliveries are improving.

In Israel, the health ministry's vaccine advisory group recommended a booster dose for older adults but was divided on whether the cutoff should be 60, 65, or 70, according to Haaretz, a newspaper based in Tel Aviv [https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israeli-health-ministry-panel-recommends-third-covid-shot-for-older-people-1.10049085].

Data presented at the group's meeting suggested that the vaccine's effectiveness against severe disease in 60-year-old people has declined from 97% in January [2021] to 81%. Israel is using 2-dose mRNA vaccines in its immunization program.

Most of the panel members agreed that people age 60 and older should receive a booster, but some pushed for an older limit. The head of the country's health ministry is expected to make the final decision, and government leaders will discuss the health and economic factors of adding a 3rd dose.

At the end of June [2021], the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) issued interim recommendations for a booster dose, which said any potential booster dose program should begin in September [2021] to head off extra pressure on health systems if SARS-CoV-2 circulates alongside seasonal flu.

They said any potential booster shot program should be rolled out in 2 stages: 1st in those older than 70 and in high-risk groups such as health workers and those who are immunocompromised, then 2nd in all adults older than 50 and those who are in other risk groups.

Africa patterns show a mixed picture, with more vaccine on the way
------------------------------------------
At a media briefing today [29 Jul 2021], the head of the WHO's African region office said Africa is still in the middle of its 3rd wave, but cases have declined for 2 weeks in a row. Matshidiso Moeti, MBBS, said the slight slowdown is promising and a cause for cautious optimism. "But we are not out of the woods yet" [https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/jcvi-interim-advice-on-a-potential-coronavirus-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-for-winter-2021-to-2022/jcvi-interim-advice-potential-covid-19-booster-vaccine-programme-winter-2021-to-2022].

She said most of the drop this week was in South Africa, the region's hardest hit country. However, 22 countries in Africa reported steep rises of 20% or more over the past 2 weeks, with the highly transmissible delta variant now detected in 26 of the region's countries.

Regarding vaccine supply, Moeti said supplies are quickly ramping up from multiple sources, after stalling in June [2021]. Africa received 4 million doses from COVAX last week, with deliveries from the African Union's procurement program also picking up. The United States announced yesterday [28 Jul 2021] that it was donating 5.7 million doses of Pfizer vaccine to South Africa through the COVAX program.

So far, only 1.6% of the continent's population is fully vaccinated, 61 times less than high-income countries. "There's light at the end of the tunnel on vaccine deliveries to Africa, but it must not be snuffed out again. I urge all countries with surplus doses to urgently share more in the spirit of life-saving solidarity and enlightened self-interest, because no country is safe until all countries are safe," she said, adding that African countries should step up their preparedness to receive and deploy the incoming doses.

More global headlines
--------------------
- In an address to the United Nations General Assembly yesterday [28 Jul 2021], the 2 experts who led the independent panel that reviewed the world's response to the pandemic and issued recommendations in May [2021] said the pandemic is an ongoing disaster that could have been averted. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia's former president, and Helen Clark, New Zealand's former prime minister, said geopolitical tensions and nationalism have weakened the multilateral system to keep the world safe. They called on the General Assembly to do more to back reforms and strengthen the world's system for handling pandemic threats.
- China's cases are at a 6-month high in the wake of an outbreak in Nanjing involving the delta variant that has spread to 13 cities and 7 provinces, according to the Washington Post [<wapo.st/3fhrQVQ>]. Also, Beijing has reported its 1st case in nearly 6 months, according to CNN [<cnn.it/3fhrVZE>].
- In other Asian developments, Tokyo's cases reached another daily high, with 3865 new infections in the city that is currently hosting the Olympic summer games. Thailand reported another single-day high, amid reports of hospitals in Bangkok running out of beds, and Myanmar's junta government has asked for outside help in battling its surge.
- In the Middle East, the delta variant is fueling surges in a number of countries and has now been reported in 15 of the 22 nations, the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean office said today [29 Jul 2021]. The hardest hit countries so far include Iran, Iraq, Tunisia, and Libya, where some hospitals are reaching capacity and oxygen supplies are in short supply.
- In Australia's New South Wales state, where the greater Sydney area is battling an outbreak, officials reported another daily record high, amid a report that the country has asked the military to help enforce the city's lockdown, which was recently extended by 4 weeks.
- The global total today [29 Jul 2021] topped 196 million cases and is at 196 077 698 cases with at least 4 187 339 deaths, according to the New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html].

[There is disagreement over administration of a booster dose. Pfizer, which advocates the booster, cites the Israeli data above. Furthermore, "among people ages 65 to 85, the Pfizer data suggest that antibody levels that should protect against delta, grow 11-fold more than following a 2nd dose.

"The data, which involved tests of 23 people, have not yet been peer-reviewed or published.

"It's not clear if boosted antibody levels actually correlate to better protection, or if that extra protection is even needed. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current vaccines protect people well against all the common variants" [https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/pfizer-third-dose-data-bn/index.html].

"Pfizer and partner BioNtech released new safety and efficacy data for their coronavirus vaccine Wednesday [28 Jul 2021] and said it shows that protection holds up for at least 6 months, although it may start to wane slightly toward the end of that time.

"The pre-print paper [see citation below], posted Wednesday [28 Jul 2021] to the online server <medrxiv.org>, updates results from Pfizer's trial involving 44 000 volunteers around the world" [https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/pfizer-third-dose-data-bn/index.html]."

In addition to the debate over necessity of a booster dose, there is the issue that when frontline workers in less developed countries have not yet been vaccinated with their 1st dose, is it ethical to begin booster doses in the developed world? This inequity comes up repeatedly. - Mod.LK]
