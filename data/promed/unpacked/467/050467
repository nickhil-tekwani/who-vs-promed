Investigations conducted on a camel consignment coming from Sudan and placed in the Abu Simbel veterinary quarantine station revealed that 12 among them were affected by coronavirus infection.

As a consequence, Major General Magdy Hegazy, Governor of Aswan, issued strict instructions to health and quarantine officials for the implementation of all necessary tests on all animals coming from Sudan to Egypt via the Argeen border crossing port. It must be ascertained that they are free from any serious diseases through health and veterinary facilities of the tourist city of Abu Simbel.

Hijazi stressed in a press statement the need to raise the degree of readiness at all land and river ports and take all necessary precautions with positive cases to preserve the health and safety of people from any infectious or contagious diseases.

For his part, Dr. Ahmed Abdul Karim, General Manager of the Aswan and the Red Sea veterinary quarantine, revealed that a shipment of 4665 camels was booked over the last few days after it reached the Egyptian territory through Argeen port. Some of them were found affected with coronavirus, which triggered 2 series of random surveys conducted by veterinarians on 430 camels at a 1st stage, of which 10 tested positive, then on 300 at a 2nd stage, giving positive results for 2 camels.

Abdul Karim added that 1000 more samples were taken from other animals yesterday [Mon 14 Mar 2016], and their results are still awaited. He added: "The same was done on 12 people living in close contact with the camels to check on the safety and health of escorts."

[Sudan's dromedary camel population is ranked as the world's 2nd largest, with (2014 OIE data) 4.8 million head. The world's largest dromedary population is Sudan's neighbor, Somalia, with about 7 million head (2003 data). Sudan is followed by Kenya (3 million, 2014), Ethiopia (2.5 million, 2014), Mauritania (1.3 million, 2005) and Pakistan (1.0 million, 2014). The total world population is estimated at 20-25 million. Clearly, the vast majority of the world's dromedary population is in East Africa, around the horn of Africa.

Egypt is a major importer of live camels from Sudan; there is a continuous flow of live camels for slaughter, mainly in the Cairo metropolitan area but also elsewhere. Figures are roughly estimated to exceed 100 000 camels per year (late 90's of the 20th century). Current figures will be appreciated. The local camel population of Egypt (2014 figures) totals less than 68 000. In case MERS-CoV infection is confirmed in imported camels, the potential local patients are to be sought mainly within those handling their transportation and slaughter. - Mod.AS
