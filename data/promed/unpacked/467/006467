There are increasing reports of dying coral, diseased shellfish and waters
infected with human virus as the seas rise in temperature and pollution
from the land intensifies, researchers said Friday in studies presented at
the national meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
James W. Porter, an ocean specialist at the University of Georgia said that
about 10 percent of the coral worldwide has died and if present trends and
conditions continue, another 20 to 30 percent of the coral could be lost.
In many cases, he said, the pathogens -- viruses, bacteria and fungi --
killing the coral had not been previously identified by researchers.
"Corals are like the canary in the mine," said Porter. "They are telling us
that the water where they live is becoming sub-optimal for their
existence." There has been a 446 percent increase in disease at 160 coral
sites being monitored along the Florida coast since 1996.
"We don't know if what we are seeing is a natural cycle or it is being
caused by what human beings are doing to the planet," he said. Porter said
the loss of coral is significant because the reef-building animal "is the
basis for the health of the tropical seas."
New studies show that vast colonies of human viruses migrate into coastal
waters of Florida from the 1.6 million septic tanks in Florida, said Joan
B. Rose, a University of South Florida researcher. Many people become
infected with viruses while swimming, windsurfing or boating in infected
waters. One study found almost a quarter of the people using marine beaches
develop ear infections, sore throats and eyes, respiratory or
gastrointestinal disease. Some of the viruses detected in coastal waters
are linked with heart disease, diabetes, meningitis and hepatitis. [Are the
more serious diseases, such as meningitis, a coincidence or is it a true
problem? As the summer for the northern hemisphere approaches and beach
activities increase, are these potentials for emerging diseases? Has any
similar been reported from the southern hemisphere, other than the death of
the corals? - Mod.TG
Wounds infected with waterborne viruses caused two deaths and five
hospitalizations in 1995 along the Mississippi coast, Rose said. More than
a third of water samples from Waikiki Beach in Hawaii were found in one
study to be infected with human viruses.
"Most people who come in contact with these viruses do not get ill," Rose
said. "But of the 20 to 24 percent who do, one percent become chronically
infected." Rose's team traced the migration of viruses from septic tanks
and found the pathogens infect coastal waters within 24 hours of being
flushed down toilets. Storms that churn the waters and set up currents can
speed the process and cause an even wider spread. [It would appear that the
adage of "dilution is solution to pollution" no longer the case here. -

Viruses have been detected in oysters and other shellfish in many coastal
areas. Many of the disease-causing viruses that infect humans directly or
through eating contaminated shellfish cannot be detected by the routine
monitoring of water pollution, said Rose.
Porter said the increase in pathogens in the world's oceans may be linked
to a 1.8 degree rise in sea surface temperature detected in many areas. He
blamed the warming oceans, for "a very distinctive global pattern of coral
bleaching." The warmer water kills algae living on the coral, weakening the
coral and making it more susceptible to infection.

[Mr. Porter blames the warming oceans, but the cycle may be more complex.
The warming oceans kill the algae that live on the coral, resulting in
coral death. Water that was filtered by the coral and its algae are no
longer doing that job and we are seeing the results with an increase of
human pathogens in the water. It is only my theory. If some one has more
scientific evidence on the relationship between corals and human disease,
please share it with us. - Mod.TG
