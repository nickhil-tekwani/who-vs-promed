Outbreaks of rubella and viral fever [dengue virus infection] have
been reported in Da Nang and Quang Nam Province in the last week.

Dr Pham Ngoc Ham, head of Da Nang Hospital's tropical diseases ward,
said rubella is occurring earlier than normal this year [2011]. On Mon
[14 Feb 2011], 24 children were treated at the hospital for the
disease, taking the total number of affected children in the previous
few days to 30, he said. The hospital has isolated the patients to
avoid further transmission. It has also admitted 15 patients with
viral fever and 9 others with serious dengue fever. The main reason
for the outbreaks was the abnormal weather, Ham added.

In Quang Nam Province, the General Hospital treated 90 people with
rubella and viral fever in the [past] week. Dr Nguyen Duc Hung Son,
head of the Nong Son District health clinic, said more than 1000
people had contracted viral fever since the beginning of this year
[2011].

[Rubella (also known as German measles) is an acute viral disease
that causes fever and rash for a period of 2-3 days. The disease is
mild, but birth defects may occur if the infection is acquired by a
pregnant woman, resulting in deafness, cataracts, heart defects,
mental retardation, and liver and spleen damage in 20 percent of cases
if a woman is infected early in pregnancy

Rubella virus infection is spread by contact with an infected person,
through coughing and sneezing. The average incubation period is 14
days with a range of 12-23 days. Rubella usually presents as a
nonspecific, maculopapular, generalized rash lasting 3 days or fewer
with generalized lymphadenopathy, particularly of the posterior
auricular, suboccipital and posterior cervical lymph nodes. Up to 50
percent of infections occur without rash.

Many illnesses can mimic rubella, and up to 50 percent of rubella
infections are asymptomatic. Therefore, the only reliable evidence of
acute rubella virus infection is laboratory diagnosis. Rubella can be
prevented by vaccination, and rubella has been largely eliminated
where uptake of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) triple vaccine is
high.

The Vietnamese report is unusual in that it implies that the
occurrence of the disease is seasonal, localised, and synchronous with
outbreaks of other viral fevers. Further information on the prevalence
of rubella in Viet Nam would be appreciated.
