Japan has discovered suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]
in pigs at a farm in Miyazaki prefecture, where the government
confirmed the 1st outbreak since 2000 in cows last week [week of 19 Apr 2010]

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in a
statement today [Tue 27 Apr 2010] that 5 pigs at the farm were found
to have the disease according to initial test results. All 486 pigs
at the farm are being culled, it said.

The FMD virus is one of the most contagious animal diseases and can
have high mortality rates in young animals, according to the
Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Eating
infected meat doesn't harm humans.

To contain the disease, the Japanese government has limited
transportation of animals in the region, killing them at farms where
suspected cases were discovered and disinfecting the area. Miyazaki
is on Japan's southern island of Kyushu.

Japan's last outbreak of the disease was in 2000, when the country
slaughtered 740 cattle, according to Katsumi Yorita, deputy director
at the ministry's livestock industry policy planning division.

Miyazaki Prefecture government said Tuesday [27 Apr 2010] they
discovered symptoms of FMD on pigs [at the Kawaminami County
Livestock Experiment Station].

Though they haven't performed PCR or serological testing they were
planning to cull all 486 pigs in the farm.

If these cases were confirmed they would be the 1st FMD porcine
cases, the National Institute of Animal Health said.

<http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japans-1st-suspected-cases-of-foot-and-mouth-in-pigs-reported>


Suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease in livestock have been
found at 3 more locations in Miyazaki Prefecture, including Japan's
1st suspected cases involving pigs, the local government and the farm
ministry said Wednesday [28 Apr 2010].

The latest findings bring the tally of suspected infections to 10 and
will result in the slaughter of about 2900 cows and pigs in total in
an effort to prevent the disease from spreading, the Miyazaki
prefectural government said.

5 cows at a farm and 5 pigs at a livestock experiment station in the
town of Kawaminami, where other cows were already confirmed infected
last week [week of 19 Apr 2010], tested positive for the disease,
while 4 to 8 cows are suspected to have the disease at a farm in
Ebino, a city more than 50 km [31 mi] [away].

The prefectural government restricted the movement of livestock
within 10 km [6.2 mi] of the Ebino farm, and banned removing
livestock from an area within 20 km [12.4 mi] of the farm, thus
affecting some parts of neighboring Kumamoto and Kagoshima prefectures.

[While in previous reports, the Japanese authorities indicated that
the outbreak had started on 7 Apr 2010, in the current follow-up
report no. 2, the date of the start of the outbreak given is 31 Mar
2010. This may reflect findings during the epidemiological
investigations, and will explain the spread of the disease.
Identification of the virus was initially carried out on 20 Apr 2010,
followed by the application of quarantine, stamping out and animal
movement restrictions. The virus may have circulated within Japanese
territory at least 3 weeks before being identified. According to
Japan's report, so far 10 farms have been confirmed as infected. A
map is included in the follow-up 2 report, at the URL above. - Mod.AS]
