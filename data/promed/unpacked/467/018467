I lived outside of Brazil for 4 years, and in March [2015], I moved to Bahia. My wife, 3-4 months pregnant, was hit by [a] Zika [virus infection], and at this time, my [fetal] daughter was diagnosed with microcephaly at the 5th [gestational] month.

The 2 ultrasonographers who we visited stated that these cases have increased a lot in their practices. Last year [2014], neither of the 2 had any cases [of microcephaly] in Bahia, and this year [2015], each have had more than 8 cases due to be born in October-November 2015. My daughter was due to be born on 5 Nov [2015].

I am convinced that there is a relationship [between Zika virus infection and microencephaly] and that we are not the only ones. A number of cases in Bahia, all related to Zika [virus infections] between the 4th and 5th month of gestation, coincided with due dates for births in October and November 2015.

[2 days later, the contributor added these comments:]

At the time of the examination, dengue and other diseases were all negative. Symptoms appeared at the time that there was a great Zika epidemic in the north east, leading doctors to diagnose the disease without much difficulty. We also did tests for cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, HIV, syphilis, rubella, and all were negative. I have pictures of my pregnant wife with patches on the skin characteristic of Zika.

I found out that the government of Pernambuco created a page for the reporting of all cases born with microcephaly but are classifying such illnesses as an HC [head circumference] less than 33 cm, with which I do not agree. I have a friend here in Bahia and in Rio de Janeiro who had children born with an HC of 31cm and today are normal children 4 years old. I do not know whether there have always been the large numbers of microcephalic [children] or whether the system became more sensitive by the existence of the current suspicion of Zika virus infections.

[The fundamental question is whether cases of microencephaly are occurring coincident with maternal infection with Zika virus. There seems to be no standard, fixed measurement for microencephaly. I consulted a pediatrician at a large USA medical center to clarify the criteria used to define microencephaly. He wrote: "The definition of microcephaly is not standardized. It is sometimes defined as an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) more than 3 standard deviations (SD) below the mean for a given age, sex, and gestation. Other times, it is defined as an OFC of more than 2 SD below the appropriate mean (that is, less than the 3rd percentile). It is important to record measurements rather than percentiles, as head circumference charts vary, especially up to the age of 3 years, and to use the most recent culturally and ethnically relevant charts to determine percentiles.

"If microcephaly is defined as a head size less than 3 SD below the appropriate mean, it is more likely to be associated with genetic and non-genetic disorders affecting brain development. In contrast, if microcephaly is defined as more than 2 SD below the mean, many intellectually normal individuals who have a head circumference at the low end of the population distribution will be included."

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional information on this case. Was the daughter truly microencephalic per the criteria given above (any standard deviations from the mean for her cohort)? Was there any evidence of Zika virus persistence in the correspondent's daughter after her birth? Was Zika virus infection of the wife confirmed serologically or by presence of the virus by PCR or virus isolation?

ProMED-mail would be very interested in receiving information from knowledgeable sources about the other Bahia cases of microencephaly mentioned, and their relationship to maternal Zika virus infection, if any. Given the substantial increase in Zika virus infections in Brazil and now in Colombia, informed observations on occurrence of microencephaly would be of interest as well. Meanwhile, physicians attending women who have been infected with Zika virus while pregnant might be aware of this apparent association and report cases of microencephaly.

Perinatal transmission of Zika virus has been observed (Besnard M, Last√®re S, Teissier A, Cao-Lormeau VM, Musso D. Evidence of perinatal transmission of Zika virus, French Polynesia, December 2013 and February 2014 . Euro Surveill. 2014;19(13):pii=20751. Article DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES2014.19.13.20751, but there have been no reports of transplacental transmission earlier in gestation.
