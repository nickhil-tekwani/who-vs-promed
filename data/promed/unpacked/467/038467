The Generalitat (local autonomous government authority) detected a legionellosis outbreak in Ripollet (Barcelona) that has affected 5 persons, 3 of whom died, 1 is still hospitalized, and 1 has already been discharged from the hospital. A concurrent outbreak, which was detected 9 days ago, occurred in Sabadell (Barcelona), and has affected 34 persons, most of them elderly. 4 of these patients died and 17 are still hospitalized. The Ripollet outbreak was not reported until now because the affected individuals were admitted to distant hospitals, such as Calella and Hospital Del Mar Hospital in Barcelona.

This latest occurrence was announced last Tuesday [23 Sep 2014] in a press conference by the Secretary of the Public Health Agency of Catalonia, Mr Antoni Mateu, together with Mr Juan Parralejo, Mayor of Ripollet, and Ms Mireia Jane, Vice-Director of the Surveillance and Emergency Response in the Public Health Agency.

An eighth person has died from the lung infection legionnaires' disease in northeastern Spain, where two separate outbreaks have struck this month, officials said Thursday.

The latest death took place in the town of Sabadell, where another four people have died from an outbreak detected on September 5, the Catalonia regional health department said in a statement.

The department reported earlier this week that three people had also died from the disease in Ripollet, about 10 kilometres (six miles) from Sabadell, also in the Catalonia region.

The proximity of the two towns raised suspicions that the cases of legionnaires' were linked but this possibility has since been ruled out, a health department official told AFP.

Fourteen people between the ages of 50 and 92 remain in hospital in Sabadell with the disease.

The disease is not contagious and cannot be spread directly from person to person but can multiply in water and air conditioning systems.

It is usually caught by breathing in small droplets of contaminated water.

There have been no new infections diagnosed in Sabadell since September 18 and none in Ripollet since September 16.

But Catalan health officials said they could not rule out more new cases since Legionnaires' disease can develop up to 10 days after exposure to the legionella bacteria.

Large buildings such as hotels, hospitals, museums and office blocks are more vulnerable to legionella contamination because they have larger, more complex water supply systems in which the bacteria can quickly spread.

[ProMED-mail previously reported this outbreak of legionnaires' disease in the Comarca (county) of Valles Occidental that had at time involved 23 cases, including 2 fatalities, in 3 towns north of Barcelona (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - Spain: (CT) fatal 20140919.2788763); 20 of these 23 cases live in the city of Sabadell, 2 in the town of Barbera del Valles, and 1 in the town of Cerdanyola del Valles (Valles Occidental). The 1st news report above adds 11 more cases and the 2nd news report adds 4 more deaths for a total of 34 cases, including 8 deaths in these 3 towns.

In addition, the news reports above add another adjacent town (Ripollet) with 5 cases, including 3 deaths. Ripollet is a municipality of 29 877 residents in Valles Occidental in Catalonia located between Barbera del Valles and Cerdanyola (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripollet). The 2nd news report says, "The proximity of the two towns raised suspicions that the cases of legionnaires' were linked but this possibility has since been ruled out, a health department official told AFP." ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources about how the Ripollet cases of legionnaires' disease differ from those in Sabadell, Barbera del Valles and Cerdanyola?

The prior news report said that 21 facilities with 38 cooling towers had been analyzed for _Legionella_ and remediated. Although samples were taken from these towers at the time, the news report above does not reveal the results of any microbiological testing.

Genotyping of patient and environmental _Legionella_ isolates may aid in establishing transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, this is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Sabadell is the 2nd largest city, with a population of 207 938 people, in the southern portion of the Comarca of Valles Occidental, in Catalonia, Spain, 20 km (12 mi) north of Barcelona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabadell). (A comarca is roughly equivalent to a US "county.") Barbera del Valles is a city of 29 208 people in Valles Occidental, 3 km (1.9 mi) south of Sabadell (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barberà_del_Vallès). Cerdanyola del Valles is a city of 58 747 people in Valles Occidental, 4.4 km (2.7 mi) south of Barbera del Valles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerdanyola_del_Vallès).
