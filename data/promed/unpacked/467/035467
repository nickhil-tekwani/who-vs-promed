Cattle diseases kill 1500 cattle in Bangladesh
------------------------------------------
Cattle diseases that broke out in an alarming proportion in southern
Bangladesh have claimed lives of over 1500 head of cattle and affected 7000
others in the last 2 months. The diseases broke out in the Bagerhat
district of [the administrative district of Khulna, in] southern
Bangladesh, bordering the Bay of Bengal. The situation has turned acute, as
the veterinary hospitals in the district cannot provide treatment to the
affected cattle due to scarcity of vaccines and medicines, Bangladesh's
private news agency UNB reported on Monday [20 Jun 2005].
The panic-stricken farmers time and again urged the deputy commissioner of
the district and United Nations Organizations to ensure supply of vaccines
and medicines for the treatment of sick cattle. But no steps have yet been
taken in this regard. They also alleged that treatment activities are being
hampered, as a number of posts are lying vacant in different veterinary
hospitals of the district.
District livestock officer Dr M Golbar Hossain Khan said that despite the
crisis regarding vaccines and the shortage of manpower, they are trying
their best to overcome the situation.
