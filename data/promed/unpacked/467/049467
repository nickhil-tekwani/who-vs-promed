[1] Cholera - Kenya (Nakuru County)

New cases of cholera have been reported in Nakuru town despite efforts by the county health department to arrest the outbreak, which has claimed 10 lives. Health Executive Kabii Mungai yesterday [3 May 2015] said another person died from the disease on [Sat 2 May 2015], as new cases were reported in Bahati sub-county. "Total number of cholera cases reported in Nakuru county has now reached 63. 10 have so far died, while others are receiving treatment in various health facilities," said Dr Mungai.

Mungai said a team of public health officers has embarked on awareness campaign to help curb the outbreak, which was first reported in parts of Ponda Mali, Kwa Rhonda, Kiti, and Kenlands estates. He said Nakuru Water Services and Sewerage Company have been directed to enhance water treatment.

The county government has also received 183 000 chlorine tablets from Kenya Red Cross, which will be distributed to residents for water treatment.

"The county government has opened cholera treatment centre at Langa Langa to avoid congestion at the general facility that is currently overwhelmed," said the county executive. Kabii added that sewerage and drainage systems are also being repaired in Ponda Mali and Bondeni estate to ensure proper waste disposal.

After a cholera outbreak in Kabati, Kandara sub county in Murang'a county, 2 people have died and scores of others are hospitalized. Authorities have confirmed 40 people are admitted in various hospitals. Health practitioners have set up a makeshift medical camp at Nguthuru dispensary to respond to the large numbers of patients.

Murang'a county public health executive James Mbai said the county has mobilized resources to provide free chlorine for the residents. He said preliminary results from Kemri have confirmed the 2 died of cholera. "We are doing everything we can to ensure the disease does not spread to other areas by treating water," Mbai said.

[Murang'a County (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muranga_County) is one of the counties of Kenya's former Central Province. Its largest town and capital is Murang'a, called Fort Hall in colonial times (before 1963). The south-central county can be found on a map at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muranga_County. - Mod.LL]

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Nairobi County)

At least 30 people have been admitted to a hospital in Nairobi after they contracted cholera. Most of them are from Laini Saba in the Kibera slum, according to the Public Health Department. The patients are in old maternity wards at the Mbagathi Sub-County Hospital.

Lang'ata District Surveillance Officer Samuel Muturi said he had been asked to coordinate efforts to contain the water borne disease and prevent it from spreading to other parts of Nairobi. The Public Health Department says the outbreak was reported on Mon 27 Apr 2015.

Most cholera cases in Nairobi are in Darajani of Laini Saba, near the heavily polluted Nairobi River. Lang'ata Public Health Officer James Mwita attributed the outbreak to contaminated drinking water. A community health worker in Kibera who did not want to be named said water samples from the area sent to the Government Chemist tested positive for cholera bacteria.

Mr Mwita urged residents with prolonged diarrhoea to seek medical attention. "Cholera causes the body to lose fluids. Without urgent medical attention, patients may die," he said.

Nairobi County Director of Communication Beryl Okundi said the regional government was distributing potable water to slum residents.

Another 5 persons have been confirmed dead as a result of a cholera outbreak ravaging in Ebonyi State, South East Nigeria, since February 2015.

The disease, which has claimed 20 lives in the state, has affected 256 persons, while more had been hospitalized in various hospitals in the state.

The latest deaths were confirmed by the state Director of Public Health and Disease Control, Ministry of Heath in Abakaliki, Dr Christian Achi.

Achi said the epidemic had spread to 7 of the 13 local government areas of the state. He traced the outbreak to Amachi community in Abakaliki Local Government Area.

Achi said 22 persons, who died as a result of the disease, resorted to self-medication and warned the residents against the trend. "They were treating themselves and they died as a result of that, even when they ran to hospitals when they were in critical conditions,'' he said.

The health director said the latest casualties were recorded in Oriuzor Ezza North Local Government Area and Umuogudu Akpu and Umuogudu Oshia in Ohaukwu Local Government Area. He, however, said a team of medical experts from the Federal Ministry of Health, Abuja had been dispatched to the state to control the epidemic.

Mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluids and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness. As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), Nova Science Publishers, 2015 (in press):

As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that it was found that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in refugees from war-torn Bangladesh, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally based on glucose or rice powder, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation.
