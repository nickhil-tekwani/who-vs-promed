In Nigeria this month [January 2018], 21 people have died from Lassa fever, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control said on Wednesday [31 Jan 2018], in the latest outbreak in Africa's most populous nation.

"Since the beginning of 2018, 80 cases have been classified as: 77 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases with 21 deaths," the NCDC said on Twitter.

Cases have been reported in 13 of 36 states, while 10 health care workers had been affected, it added.

Lassa fever belongs to the same family as Marburg and Ebola, 2 deadly viruses that lead to infections with fever, vomiting and in worst-case scenarios, haemorrhagic bleeding.

Its name comes from the town of Lassa in northern Nigeria where it was 1st identified in 1969.

More than 100 people were killed in 2016 in one of the nation's worst outbreaks of the disease, affecting 14 of the 36 states, including Lagos and the capital Abuja.

The virus is spread through contact with food or household items contaminated with rats' urine or faeces or after coming into direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.

The disease can be prevented through enhanced personal hygiene, avoidance of all contact with rats, and keeping the house and surroundings clean.

In Ondo state, 6 persons have been confirmed dead and 27 others under watch as the Lassa fever epidemic spreads.

Also, the Chief Medical Director of the Federal Medical Center, FMC, Asaba, Delta State, Dr Victor Osiatuma has disclosed that a female adult, brought in from Anambra State last Sunday [28 Jan 2018], has died of the fever. Osiatuma, who disclosed this yesterday [31 Jan 2018] while receiving personal protective items donated by the Delta State government to the FMC to effectively curtail the Lassa fever outbreak in the state, said the female victim died Monday [29 Jan 2018], a day after she was brought in.

The affected council areas in Ondo, where 26 persons are under watch, include Owo, Akoko south-west, Akure North and Akure south.

To prevent the spread, the state government has directed that any occurrence of the viral disease should "henceforth be brought to the notice of health officials at the council areas across the state." The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro gave the directive at a meeting with Primary Health Care, PHC, Coordinators in the 18 council areas of the state. The meeting, attended by the Commissioner for Local government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Hon. Lola Fagbemi, the Administrative Secretary, Primary Health Care Development, Caretaker Chairmen in the 18 LG council and their primary health care coordinators, held in Akure, was at the instance of the deputy governor, Mr. Agboola Ajayi.

Adegbenro pointed out that it has become imperative that "burial for the body of any sudden death must henceforth be supervised by medical experts to prevent the possible spread of the disease, which had recorded 27 cases and 6 deaths.

Speaking on some of the preventive measures, the commissioner advised that, "We must discourage our people from sun drying garri and other stable foods by the roadside where rodents can contaminate them.

Also, the Information and Orientation Commissioner, Mr. Yemi Olowolabi said: "The isolation centre at the Federal Medical centre in Owo had also been reinforced to take adequate care of patients as part of efforts to check the spread of the disease." Olowolabi added that government was embarking on sensitisation of the public on unhygienic habits that could aid the spread of Lassa fever in the state.

Delta state has confirmed 2 cases of the Lassa fever infection, with one patient said to be dead.

The identity of the dead victim could not be ascertained at press time, but the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nicholas Azinge, confirmed the cases in Asaba late Wednesday [31 Jan 2018].

The patient, our correspondent learnt, was brought in on Sunday [28 Jan 2018] and died on Monday [29 Jan 2018].

Azinge said he is in contact with his counterpart in Anambra State in regard to the dead victim, who is said to have been brought in from Anambra State to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Asaba.

He added that the corpse will be handed over to his colleague so that proper burial arrangement is carried out, so as not to expose more persons to the disease.

The other case, according to him, is a 43-year old man who was brought to the FMC and successfully treated. He was later referred to Irrua Specialist Hospital in Edo State. Aringe said the family members of the man and the ambulance driver who conveyed him to the hospital are being closely monitored, while other contact tracing is on-going.

The Commissioner made the disclosures while donating personal protective items on behalf of the state government to the management of FMC, as part of its collaborative efforts to address the spread of the disease.

The items included 250 pieces of disposable coat/suit, 500 pieces elbow length gloves, 50 packets of surgical hand gloves, 50 sets protective boots, among others.

Azinge said the items would enable medical personnel at the hospital to effectively fight the disease that has re-emerged after a deadly outbreak in 2016, when a medical doctor in an Asaba private hospital lost his life.

The Commissioner assured Deltans that the relevant authorities are on top of the situation, adding that there is no need for residents to be alarmed since the state was able to effectively handle the disease the last time it emerged. He added all the Primary Healthcare Centres in the state have been activated, while sensitization activities have been stepped up, and advised residents to report any case of malaria and typhoid fever that are not responding to treatment to the nearest medical facility, as early report of cases will save lives.

Receiving the items, Medical Director, FMC, Asaba, Dr. Victor Osiatuma, expressed gratitude to the state government for the gesture.

Speaking on the dead victim, Osiatuma said the hospital is strictly following the protocol of handling the corpse in order not to spread the disease.

He assured residents of the ability of the hospital to handle the disease, stating that with the donated items and training given to their personnel, the spread will be effectively curbed.

[As noted in the previous post, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year (2018) up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened with the cases of the 10 health care workers mentioned in the 1st report above. Early in the course of Lassa fever, patients present with a general febrile disease with symptoms common to a variety of infections, including malaria, making it more difficult for healthcare workers to know when personal protective equipment should be used.

The Nigeria NCDC and its EOC (Emergency Operations Centre) are actively dealing with the state health care personnel in the affected states currently.
