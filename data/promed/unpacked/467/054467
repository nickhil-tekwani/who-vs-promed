[The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_, a
member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although
long regarded to be fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered
protists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called
the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

There is evidence that established older _A. astaci_ strains that have been
present in Europe for many years are less aggressive than newer strains
introduced with crayfish imports from North America since the 1960s. Some
isolates from warmer waters in Spain have temperature/growth curves with
higher optimum temperatures compared with those from northern Europe.

Although _A. astaci_ is not an obligate parasite and will grow well under
laboratory conditions on artificial media, in the natural environment it
does not survive well for long periods in the absence of a suitable host.
It has been shown that _A. astaci_ cysts survive for 2 weeks in distilled
water, and that zoospores remained motile for up to 3 days. As _A. astaci_
can go through 3 cycles of zoospore emergence, the maximum life span
outside of a host could be several weeks.

_A. astaci_, both in culture and in infected crayfish, is killed by a short
exposure to temperatures of 60 deg C (140 deg F) or to temperatures of -20
deg C (-4 deg F) or less for 48 hours or more. Sodium hypochlorite and
iodophores are effective for disinfection of contaminated equipment.
Thorough drying of equipment (more than 24 hours) is also effective, as
_Aphanomyces_ is not resistant to desiccation.

There is good field and experimental evidence that movements of fish from
areas in which crayfish plague is active can transmit infection from one
watershed to another. _A. astaci_ can also be spread by contaminated
equipment (nets, boots, clothing, etc).

The information above is derived from chapter 2.3.7. "Crayfish Plague
(_Aphanomyces astaci_)" in OIE's (World Organisation for Animal Health)
Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic animals. The chapter includes
additional comprehensive information on the agent factors, host factors,
disease pattern, diagnosis, control and prevention, etc; see
