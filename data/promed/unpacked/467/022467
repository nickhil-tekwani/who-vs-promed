The Sudanese Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed the outbreak of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) in Darfur on [Tue 27 Oct 2015].

The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan stated in its latest weekly bulletin that according to the Health Ministry, a total of 182 suspected VHF cases, including 103 deaths, were reported in the 5 Darfur states from [29 Aug to 25 Oct 2015].

Of the 36 samples taken from suspected cases and people who had contact with them, and tested at the Central Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum, 8 samples from Central, West, and North Darfur tested positive for West Nile virus, while 4 samples from West and Central Darfur tested positive for chikungunya virus.

West Nile virus is a type of haemorrhagic fever, commonly found in Africa that can cause fatal neurological disease and is often transmitted by infected mosquitoes. [This is not accurate. West Nile virus infection does not cause hemorrhagic disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA notes that 70-80 per cent of infections are asymptomatic, 1 in 5 infected individuals develop fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Less than 1 per cent of people who are infected will develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis. (http://www.cdc.gov/westnile/symptoms/index.html). West Nile virus is overwhelmingly caused by mosquito bite, and rarely by blood transfusion or tissue transplant. - Mod.TY]. Chikungunya is a viral disease, also transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and is characterised with an abrupt onset of fever accompanied by joint pains.

None of the samples tested positive for yellow fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, or Rift Valley fever.

The state with the highest number of cases was West Darfur (110), followed by North and Central Darfur with 33 cases each, East Darfur with 5 cases, and South Darfur with 1. West Darfur had the highest number of fatalities (81), followed by North Darfur (15), 6 in Central Darfur, and 1 in East Darfur.

Joint Health Ministry-WHO verification teams have been deployed to the Darfur states. Vector control activities have started and infection control measures were initiated in the affected localities. Additional pumps, fogging machines and insecticides, provided by the Ministry and WHO, will be transported to the affected localities.

[2] WHO team arrives

WHO experts have arrived in Sudan on [Sun 1 Nov 2015] to assess the response to the haemorrhagic fever outbreak in Darfur. The arrival of the international team comes as the joint investigations teams dispatched to Darfur earlier this month [October 2015] confirmed the outbreak of the haemorrhagic disease in several states in the western Sudan region.

In statements to Sudan Tribune on Sunday WHO Sudan's director Naeema Hassan Al-Gaseer said the experts' team has arrived to the Sudanese capital, adding they will immediately start their mission on the ground on [Mon 2 Nov 2015]. ''They will visit the Darfur states to assess the situation and they will also evaluate the needed assistances of the Sudanese ministry of health in the fields of laboratory, surveillances and the preventive measures,'' Al-Gaseer added. She confirmed that 103 people have died of the fever in the western region of Darfur and said that 182 suspected haemorrhagic fever (VHF) were reported in the 5 Darfur states.

In its weekly bulletin of this week, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported on [27 Oct 2015] an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in Darfur. "According to the MoH, from [29 Aug to 25 Oct 2015], a total of 182 suspected VHF cases, including 103 deaths, were reported in 12 localities in South, East, Central, West, and North Darfur," OCHA revealed on Friday.

The medical tests in Darfur confirmed the presence of the West Nile virus in Central, West, and North Darfur while samples from West and Central Darfur tested positive for chikungunya virus. None of the samples tested positive for yellow fever, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, or Rift Valley fever, the report says.

The highest number of cases was found in West Darfur (110) followed by North and Central Darfur with 33 cases each, 5 cases in East Darfur, while only 1 case tested positive in South Darfur. Also, West Darfur had the highest number of fatalities (81), followed by North Darfur (15), 6 in Central Darfur, and 1 in East Darfur.

The joint heath teams deployed in Darfur launched a campaign to eradicate the insects which transmit disease pathogens. they also started infection control measures in the affected localities. "Additional pumps, fogging machines, and insecticides -- provided by MoH and WHO -- will be transported to the affected states," OCHA said.

In 2012, an outbreak of yellow fever hit the troubled region of western Sudan killing some 171 people. The federal health ministry and WHO reported that there had been 847 suspected cases.

[The situation in Darfur is confusing. There is little doubt that there is an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease going on in Darfur. Attributing these cases to West Nile (WN) virus infection raises significant questions because WN fever is not a hemorrhagic disease; nor is chikungunya fever. Either cases with rash are being classified as hemorrhagic, and could be West Nile virus (WN) or chikungunya virus infections, or if the cases are truly hemorrhagic the reliability of the WN virus laboratory tests are doubtful. These reports do not indicate which tests were used, or if the diagnoses were serologic or based on detection of virus. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving this information.

Mod.ML commented concerning previous cases, "Hemorrhagic fever can be caused by a variety of viruses that have been known to occur in Sudan. Viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] can be caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHFs are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague."

One hopes that the WHO team will help to clarify the situation in Darfur. Submission of duplicate samples to a regional reference laboratory, such as the Pasteur Institute Laboratory in Senegal, would be helpful.
