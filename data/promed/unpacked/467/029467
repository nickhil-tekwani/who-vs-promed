Many recent disease outbreaks in humans had a zoonotic virus etiology. Bats in particular have been recognized as reservoirs to a large variety of viruses with the potential to cross-species transmission. In order to assess the risk of bats in Switzerland for such transmissions, we determined the virome of tissue and fecal samples of 14 native and 4 migrating bat species. In total, sequences belonging to 39 different virus families, 16 of which are known to infect vertebrates, were detected. Contigs of coronaviruses, adenoviruses, hepeviruses, rotaviruses A and H, and parvoviruses with potential zoonotic risk were characterized in more detail. Most interestingly, in a ground stool sample of a _Vespertilio murinus_ colony an almost complete genome of a Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was detected by next-generation sequencing and confirmed by PCR. In conclusion, bats in Switzerland naturally harbour many different viruses. Metagenomic analyses of non-invasive samples like ground stool may support effective surveillance and early detection of viral zoonoses.

[Bats are well-recognized reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens, in particular viruses. Agents that can spill over from bats to other mammals caused emerging zoonoses that affected humans and domestic animals -- such as rabies, filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg virus), henipaviruses (Hendra and Nipah virus) and coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). SARS-CoV-like viruses are a group of pathogens that originated from Chinese horseshoe bats (Fam. Rhinolophidae) and may spillover to other mammals, including humans.

The COVID-19 pandemic will cause a surge of surveillance efforts in wild animals that will be very important to identify potential zoonotic pathogens in wild reservoirs. Reservoir hosts are expected to be highly tolerant and little resistant (see https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2017.11.001). Resistance and tolerance are 2 distinct strategies of defense against infection. While resistance focuses on limiting the success of the pathogen, tolerance works on reducing the infection damage. A host that is highly tolerant and little resistant will survive (and not limit) high infection intensities, therefore being a major source for a pathogen. Bats are reservoir to many viral agents because they use a strategy of tolerance instead of one of resistance to deal with infections. - Mod.PMB

Note that Switzerland has not been considered a potential "hot zone" for newly emerging infections. The findings of potential viral pathogens in bats in Switzerland is a reminder that good surveillance is necessary globally for the early identification of novel pathogens. - Mod.MPP]
