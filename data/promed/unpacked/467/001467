Director-General of Health Datuk Seri Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said today [12 Feb 2012] that 22 students and lecturers of a private college in Selangor have tested positive for chikungunya [virus infection] after returning from a course on Pangkor island in Perak.

He said they suffered from fever, headache, cough and pain in the body and joints a week after their return to Kuang. Dr Hasan said they were among 53 students and lecturers of the college whose blood samples were taken for tests after they complained of the symptoms.

In a media statement, he said, "22 of the cases were confirmed as chikungunya [virus infections], 2 tested negative and the remaining 29 are awaiting the test results." adding that they were treated at Universiti Malaya Medical Centre.

So far this year [nationally], 23 people have contracted chikungunya [virus infections], he said, adding that the 1st case was reported in Johor on 11 Feb [2012].

The symptoms of chikungunya [virus infections] are similar to those of dengue, but the disease does not result in deaths like dengue, he said.

Last year [2011], 30 cases of chikungunya were reported compared to 804 in 2010, he added.
