[The previous outbreaks were in 2001 and then again in 2005. Both
were comparatively isolated incidents. So this outbreak is right on
schedule. Other countries in the area such as Botswana and South
Africa report a small number of periodic outbreaks since 2005, so
this is an ongoing problem. Given the havoc ASF can create even
isolated incidents should be dealt with judiciously.

The OIE report provides a map with the location of the outbreak in
the Erongo Region of Namibia.
