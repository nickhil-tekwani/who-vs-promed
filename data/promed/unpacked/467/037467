Bacterium linked to psyllid yellows, a tomato and potato disease
----------------------------------------------------------------
Allison Hansen, a doctoral student at UCR, has discovered a new
bacterial pathogen that could be responsible for "psyllid yellows," a
disease that infects and kills tomato and potato plants. The disease
is spread from plant to plant by the psyllid, a sap-sucking insect.
This psyllid commonly is called potato or tomato psyllid. She named
the pathogen "_Candidatus_ Liberibacter psyllaurous"; psyllaurous
means psyllid yellows in Latin.

In tomato alone, psyllid yellows resulted in yield losses up to 85
percent and 50 percent in commercial tomato crops in western North
America during 2001 and 2004, respectively. "The saliva of the tomato
psyllid has been known to cause yellowing of tomato and potato
leaves. The cause of this symptom has been a mystery for over a
century. One symptom of this bacterium is yellowing of the foliage,"
said Hansen.

The discovery has the potential to help plant breeders develop
resistant cultivars of potato and tomato. "We know the bacterium is
vectored by the psyllid causing yellowing and death of the plant,"
Hansen said. "We're now working to confirm whether _Ca._ L.
psyllaurous is the cause of psyllid yellows."

The new bacterium is closely related to huanglongbing or HLB, also
known as citrus greening disease. A huge scientific effort currently
is underway to study HLB of citrus, a disease that is threatening to
destroy Florida's citrus industry. "L. psyllaurous could be a good
model system to come up with methods for combating citrus greening,"
Hansen said. She is trying to sequence the bacterium's genome.

Mysterious new tomato virus found
---------------------------------
A new and unidentified virus has appeared in a number of processing
tomato fields in northern California. This new virus looks a lot like
_Tobacco streak virus_, which is fairly common in the area. But when
University of California (UC) plant pathologists ran DNA tests for
tobacco streak on tissue samples from these mysteriously diseased
plants they came back negative. Tests for other familiar tomato
viruses have also come back negative.

While this new virus has already shown up early this summer [2008] in
quite a few tomato fields, it has not yet caused significant crop
damage. "The virus is very widespread in our area," said Gene Miyao,
UC Cooperative Extension farm adviser in the Sacramento Valley. Miyao
said he first began to hear reports of the new virus in June [2008]
from pest control advisers. He has since seen it or heard of it in
fields in southern Colusa County, around Woodland and in the delta
region of San Joaquin County.

"The symptoms on plants are an odd combination between tobacco streak
and spotted wilt. Young branches have necrotic streaks beginning near
the apical growth but extending 5 inches (about 13 cm) or so at times
down the stem, like tobacco streak. Flower bracts on these branches
often are blighted. Necrotic spotting on the new leaves appears
spotted wilt-like. Fruit is without symptoms at this point. The
symptoms would indicate that the problem is a virus, rather than one
of the familiar soil borne fungal diseases that attack the vascular
system of tomatoes," Miyao said.

A number of UC plant pathologists began trying to figure out what
this ailment is. _Tobacco streak virus_ is transmitted by thrips, and
this new virus may also be transmitted by thrips. Miyao said that it
is unnerving not to know what the disease is, because that means no
one knows how serious it could become or how it should be managed.

"Virus infected plants are more prevalent in our area this year
[2008]," Miyao said. "Annually, curly top and alfalfa mosaic [viral
diseases] are commonly found in local fields but at low levels." The
increasing incidence of tomato viruses in the Sacramento Valley is,
so far, worth noticing to make sure it does not grow into a more
serious problem in the future.

[A group of symptoms known as psyllid yellows has been associated
with feeding by these insects and was thought to be due to the
injection of toxic saliva. The presence of a new Liberibacter in
plants with these symptoms has been shown in report [1] above, but
proof of causation (Koch's postulates) is still being sought.
Recently, a new species of _Candidatus_ Liberibacter has been found
which affects tomato and capsicum crops in New Zealand and can also
be associated with zebra chip disease of potato in the USA. The
tomato (or potato) psyllid _Paratrioza cockerelli_ is also suspected
to be a vector. For both psyllid yellows and zebra chip there remains
a possibility that similar symptoms may also be due to factors other
than the Liberibacters. The relationships between the 2 new
Liberibacter species and the various diseases transmitted by tomato
psyllids need to be clarified.

Only few members of _Ca._ Liberibacter have been characterised so
far, including the pathogens causing citrus greening (huanglongbing,
HLB). HLB is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus (further
information via ProMED post no. 20080701.2006), but is limited to
these crops due to the host specificity of its vector, the citrus
psyllid. In contrast, tomato psyllids have a wider host range
including species in 20 plant families, and this can be expected to
impact on the epidemiology and importance of the new pathogens.

Close to 20 viruses are known to affect tomato, including several new
species discovered recently. Both _Tobacco streak virus_ (TSV, genus
_Ilarvirus_] and _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV, genus
_Tospovirus_) are transmitted by thrips vectors (for example
_Frankliniella_ and _Thrips_ species). Both TSV and TSWV can cause
considerable damage to a range of crops. Further characterisation
including genomic sequencing of the new virus will be required to
determine its relationship to other known tomato viruses, its host
range, and its potential economic impact.
