The Government had indeed started Pulse Polio immunisation programme. It
is continued this year on December 7 and January 18. It is in addition to
regular immunisation. At Lucknow, it has been found that the coverage was
low.
In the state of Maharashtra from where full data are available, the status
is as follows:
No. of AFP cases investigated as per WHO criteria = 243.
Bombay city 64; Thane district 46; Pune district 18; Jalgaon district 13;
Nasik district 12; Aurangabad district 11; remaining 24 districts are less
than 10 each. Of these [there were 23 virologically proved cases. Cases
[de&% ??? 65. The numbers are lower than expected values.

[I do not know what "AFP" means. It does not portend well that coverage in
Lucknow was low. Either some administrative changes are in order or the
same thing might occur somewhere else. Thanks to Kalyan Banerjee for this
information. Given the human population size of India, that country will
be a linchpin in the international effort to eradicate poliomyelitis. -
