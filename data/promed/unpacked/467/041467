Outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis, known as valley fever, have reached beyond areas in which it was previously considered endemic, and most stem from the environment, according to researchers. The findings show that the disease demands increased surveillance, they wrote in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases [1].

"Increased attention to outbreak identification and tracking is worthwhile, given the continued population growth in coccidioidomycosis-endemic areas, increased settlement at the wildland-urban interface and the incompletely understood effects of intensifying climate change on _Coccidioides_," researcher Michael Freedman, MD, a pediatric resident at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, and colleagues wrote.

Valley fever is caused by _Coccidioides [immitis_] fungi, whose spores are found in soil. Patients can be exposed to it via airborne dust. It has been known to be endemic in the American Southwest, south-central Washington, northern Mexico and other parts of Latin America. The disease causes influenza-like symptoms including cough, shortness of breath, fever and fatigue.

As many as 40 of the outbreaks (85 percent) were associated with environmental exposure. Two outbreaks, accounting for 582 valley fever cases (40 percent), resulted from natural disasters in California -- the "Tempest from Tehachapi" dust storm of 1977 and the Northridge earthquake in Ventura County in 1994, the researchers said.

A total of 7 outbreaks were nonenvironmental, meaning they were health care or laboratory-related. Of those, 4 were laboratory related, 2 were organ transplant-related and 1 was nosocomial.

The researchers added that 25 outbreaks (53 percent) were associated with occupational exposure. Of those, 11 were linked to the military, 7 were associated with construction and 7 were related to archeology and other field studies. The researchers noted that workers who disturb soil in areas where valley fever-causing fungi are endemic are thought to have higher risks for infection.

Reports on 37 outbreaks (79 percent) revealed previously unknown endemicity data, the researchers said. Of those outbreaks, 12 occurred in an area not previously known to have endemic valley fever. Those areas are in Arizona, Brazil, California, Texas and Utah. Another 4 outbreaks confirmed suspicions of the disease's endemicity in certain areas, which were also located in Arizona and California.

The findings indicate that health care officials and business leaders should vigilantly keep track of where valley fever outbreaks occur and under what conditions. "Monitoring outbreaks could be critical in identifying new areas of endemicity and high-risk activities," they wrote. "Increased awareness of coccidioidomycosis among employers of persons in potentially high-risk occupations, the public and health care providers is needed to reduce both the risk and severity of future outbreaks."

Abstract
--------
"Coccidioidomycosis causes substantial illness and death in the United States each year. Although most cases are sporadic, outbreaks provide insight into the clinical and environmental features of coccidioidomycosis, high-risk activities, and the geographic range of _Coccidioides_ fungi. We identified reports published in English of 47 coccidioidomycosis outbreaks worldwide that resulted in 1464 cases during 1940-2015. Most (85 percent) outbreaks were associated with environmental exposures; the 2 largest outbreaks resulted from an earthquake and a large dust storm. More than one third of outbreaks occurred in areas where the fungus was not previously known to be endemic, and more than half of outbreaks involved occupational exposures. Coccidioidomycosis outbreaks can be difficult to detect and challenging to prevent given the unknown effectiveness of environmental control methods and personal protective equipment; therefore, increased awareness of coccidioidomycosis outbreaks is needed among public health professionals, healthcare providers, and the public."

Coccidioidomycosis is due to _Coccidioides immitis_ or _C. posadasii_, 2 nearly identical species of pathogenic fungi that grow in the top 2-8 inches (5 to 20 cm) of soil where the organism produces arthroconidia that can be disrupted and become airborne during conditions that disturb the soil. Coccidioidomycosis occurs in hot, semi-arid regions in the southwestern United States (mainly the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas, but also Nevada, Utah, and Washington State), parts of northern Mexico, and in Central and South America. The airborne spores then can travel great distances by currents of air. If inhaled, the airborne spores can produce infection in humans, as well as other animals.

Coccidioidomycosis is not transmitted from person to person. Risk of infection is highest in dry summer months. A 2nd period of risk usually occurs in the late fall, terminating with winter rains. Dust exposure is critical for acquiring an infection. Indeed, an outbreak of coccidioidomycosis followed exposure to a dust cloud that was blown downwind from the January 1994 6.7 magnitude Northridge California earthquake and its after shocks (CDC. Coccidioidomycosis following the Northridge earthquake -- California, 1994. JAMA. Jun 8 1994; 271(22): 1735).

Because the incubation period for this infection usually ranges from 1-4 weeks, tourists who became infected while visiting areas where coccidioidomycosis is endemic may not become ill until after they return home, and the diagnosis may not be considered by clinicians in areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (See prior ProMED-mail posts on coccidioidomycosis in travelers: Coccidioidomycosis - Taiwan ex USA 20090610.2140 and Coccidioidomycosis - Europe ex USA (Calif): alert 20011214.3026).

Most patients who become infected following exposure are asymptomatic, but have immunological evidence of coccidioidomycosis. Within some endemic communities in the central valley of California, nearly the entire population has serological evidence of prior infection. Infection generally imparts immunity to reinfection.

Risk factors for more severe pulmonary disease include diabetes, recent history of cigarette smoking, income of less than USD 15 000 per year, and older age (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11229838). Disseminated infection occurs more frequently in certain ethnic groups (persons of African, Filipino, and, to a lesser extent, Hispanic descent), pregnancy, and immunodeficiency, such as that due to AIDS or by immunosuppressive drugs.

Reasons for increased cases of coccidioidomycosis are not fully understood. The increase can in part be attributed to increased reporting practices, climatic change (drought and increasing temperatures in the southwestern United States) (http://www.demos.org/publication/economic-and-environmental-impacts-climate-change-arizona), dust storms, soil disturbance caused by increased construction activity, growing numbers of persons who are immunocompromised or have other risk factors for severe disease, and immigration to endemic areas of previously unexposed persons from areas where coccidioidomycosis is not endemic (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5805a1.htm).
