The City Health Office (CHO) has reported a 50% fatality rate of leptospirosis in Zamboanga City. Rescuers and victims of Tropical Storm Paeng are in danger of contracting leptospirosis after walking in floodwaters during the height of the storm last October [2022].

Based on CHO records, 10 of 20 people died from the disease in the last 10 months. All of the fatalities were male.

The figure is higher than the 13 victims reported for the same period last year [2021].

City Health Officer Dr Dulce Miravite has reminded residents to take precautionary measures days after the onslaught of Tropical Storm Paeng in Zamboanga City. The CHO distributed prophylaxis [doxycycline?] and vitamins to residents of 16 health districts whose barangays reported flooding during the height of the typhoon.

The CHO also conducted consultations for free medication for residents who were exposed to floodwaters.

[Zamboanga (pop., 977 234 residents in 2020) is a city in the Zamboanga Peninsula region of the Philippines at the western tip of Mindanao island; it is the commercial and industrial center of the Zamboanga Peninsula Region (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamboanga_City). A map showing the location of Zamboanga can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zamboanga,+Philippines.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to the urine of infected animals or to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - Tanzania: (LI) fatal, RFI 20220719.8704520.

Dr T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that, when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the US CDC advises preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis). - Mod.ML
