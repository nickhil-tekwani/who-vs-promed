Doubt Cast on BSE-vCJD Link
---------------------------
The link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow
disease" and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMed-mail, commonly thought to be its human equivalent,
has been disputed by an expert.
Dr George Venters, a consultant in Public Health Medicine in Lanarkshire,
Scotland, claims evidence linking the 2 conditions is weak. The variant
form of CJD may simply be a rare type, which existed long before the BSE
epidemic in cows, but was simply not diagnosed and catalogued properly
until the 1990s. If his theory is correct, it would mean victims of the
condition did not get it by eating infected meat. But other CJD experts say
that the evidence is strong enough to firmly suggest humans contract vCJD
by eating meat from cattle with BSE containing infectious prion proteins.
Dr Venters bases his opinion on the fact that the rate of growth in the
number of confirmed cases is much less than might be expected from a
food-borne source. He suggests the rate of growth in the number of vCJD
cases is more consistent with a previously misdiagnosed but extremely rare
disease being found. Advances in the detection and reporting of suspected
cases through the CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh could account for an
apparent rise in the number of cases, none of which would have been
officially recorded previously. He wants a public debate on the evidence
supporting a link between the 2 diseases.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Venters said government
policy should focus on "a more realistic appraisal of risk, addressing what
is likely to happen rather than what is a frightening but increasingly less
likely possibility." He said: "Without doubt, general anxiety about so
dreadful a possibility as BSE causing a similar disease in humans resulted
in many workers involved with BSE and CJD having to reach precipitate
conclusions in which public safety was rightly the prime consideration. I
believe that the evidence now available casts serious doubts on the case
for a causal link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and 'new'
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. A particular problem is that when you
have a food-borne infection you expect the rate at which cases occur to run
parallel to the rate at which the population is exposed to infection. That
doesn't seem to be happening."
But Dr Phillip Monk, a consultant in communicable diseases who investigated
a vCJD cluster in Queniborough, Leicester, dismissed the theory. He told
the Today programme that: "You only have to realise that vCJD occurs in
countries like ours that have had high problems with BSE. vCJD cases don't
occur in those countries that have not got BSE. The moment we relax our
guard, we put people at risk again."
Professor James Ironside from the CJD Surveillance Unit also disagreed with
Dr Venters' theory. He said: "I think it is an interesting paper and it is
always important to consider a range of arguments on this subject because
there are huge numbers of uncertainties. But we do know from a number of
studies done both here and in the United States that the transmissible
agent that causes BSE is the same as that which causes [variant CJD and
has also transmitted to other species including cats, wild cats and
antelope in zoos. The most probable hypothesis for linking the numbers of
species together is by food-borne exposure as was the case with BSE."
Professor Peter Smith, chairman of the scientific body that advises the
government on CJD [SEAC, said the only way to prove the link between BSE
and CJD would be to inject BSE-infected material directly into a human. But
he added that: "The circumstantial evidence is beyond reasonable doubt now
that BSE and vCJD are caused by the same infectious agent."
