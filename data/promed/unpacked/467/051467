I have the following question, that came up while reading your e-mail on
the death of a beluga whale caused by the bacterium _erysipelothrix
rhusiopathiae_:
- can't you vaccinate whales for _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_?
This is routinely done in swine (sows/outdoor kept swines) and has proven
to give an efficient protection for disease in these animals.

[The vaccine for _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_ used on swine has been
tried in dolphins and whales. It resulted in severe reactions and was
ineffective. So it is not an option to use the swine vaccine in dolphins
and whales. Currently there is no vaccine available for _Erysipelothrix
rhusiopathiae_ in dolphins and whales. - Mod.TG

[From a previous post: edited message taken from the Chicago Tribune: "The
14-year-old whale, Immiayuk, was killed by an invisible bacterium found on
the skin of fish causing a lethal blood-borne infection in whales and
dolphins, Shedd officials said...Five years ago, the same disease,
erysipelas, killed Quitz, a young Pacific white-sided dolphin at the
Shedd."
The "invisible bacterium" is rather cute, but may I ask another question? I
don't know about veterinary medicine, much to my regret. Still, isn't it
rather erysipeloid that is caused by _Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_) and
NOT erysipelas (caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci)? People can get
erysipeloid (also called, amongst many other names, blubber finger, crab
hand, whale finger.)
It's always both fun and interesting to get ProMED-mail. Thank you for your
splendid work.

[There has always been confusion on the issue of the name. However,
according to veterinary literature, erysipelas in animals is caused by
_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (insidiosa)_. - Mod.TG
