Russian and British biologists are helping Kazakh colleagues in their
efforts to establish what is causing mass-scale deaths of seals in the
Caspian Sea washing the shores of Kazakhstan. The remains of 1300 seals
which have fallen victims to the unknown epidemic have been gathered and
destroyed near the Mangyshlak peninsula on Kazakhstan's Caspian shore over
the past few days. Sources in the republic's agency for emergency
situations told Itar-Tass that local inhabitants and border guards have
been mobilised for the operation. The epidemic continues to rage, killing
more seals.

A few miles off the coast lies the islet of Kulaly, known locally as Seal
Island, where the animals usually live. The first seals died two weeks ago
but began to crawl out of the sea en masse only a few days back to die
ashore. Biologists say they do not know the cause of the epidemic.
"We still have no final conclusions on what is causing these deaths but we
expect results from the laboratory in Astrakhan today," said Marat
Khaidarov, the head of the Mangistau region's fisheries conservation
department. "Preliminary results from studies conducted by local biologists
indicate pasteurellosis," he told Reuters. State television said mammal
distemper could also be the cause of the epidemic.
About 2900 seals are estimated to have died so far, and about 300 corpses
have been cremated every day in the past week, Khaidarov said. It is not
known how many seals live in the Caspian Sea. Solders & volunteers are
burning the carcasses on the coast off the military bases of Bautino and
Fort Shevchenko.

Kazakhstan's Natural Resources Minister Serikbek Daukeyev said the outbreak
had no links with offshore oil drilling. "Tests conducted by Astrakhan
scientists as well as our own show that the seals' deaths were not in any
way caused by oil or hydrogen sulfide poisoning," he told state television
in Aktau.
The Mangistau regional authorities have declared a state of emergency.
Local residents are heavily reliant on fishing for their livelihood.

[Note that Itar-Tass (Almaty -- Kazakh capital) has 1300 seals dead while
Reuters (Bautino) has 2900 dead. Even if the latter is exaggerated, there
are still many deaths. It is worth knowing whether excess seal deaths have
been observed in the other Caspian countries -- Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. -Mod.MHJ]
