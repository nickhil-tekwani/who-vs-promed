- Mexico (Sonora). 19 Dec 2010. The city of Hermosillo has had a
severe water shortage crisis, leading thousands of families to find
alternative recipients for water storage. The average number of
recipients to store water is 13 per household. Water tanks in homes
could be the reason [for the increase in dengue cases because of
vector mosquito breeding sites]. The dengue outbreak that has caused
3157 cases in the state, of which 2744 were in Hermosillo, where 3
deaths have been confirmed. Since 1982, when Hermosillo had about 3000
cases of dengue, the numbers had not shot up like this year, where
last week 55 cases were added to the total of 2744 cases.
