Abstract

Background
In 2016, an influenza A(H7N2) virus outbreak occurred in cats in New York City's municipal animal shelters. One human infection was initially detected.

Methods
We conducted a serological survey using a novel approach to rule out cross-reactive antibodies to other seasonal influenza viruses to determine whether additional A(H7N2) human infections had occurred and to assess exposure risk.

Results
Of 121 shelter workers, one had serological evidence of A(H7N2) infection, corresponding to a seroprevalence of 0.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.02-4.5 percent). Five persons exhibited low positive titers to A(H7N2) virus, indicating possible infection; however, we could not exclude cross-reactive antibody responses to seasonal influenza viruses. The remaining 115 persons were seronegative. The seropositive person reported multiple direct cat exposures without using personal protective equipment and mild illness with subjective fever, runny nose, and sore throat.

Conclusions
We identified a 2nd case of A(H7N2) infection from this outbreak, providing further evidence of cat-to-human transmission of A(H7N2) virus.

[The 1st reported outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A(H7N2) virus among cats was detected in 3 facilities of the municipal animal shelter system in New York City (NYC), New York, in 2016 [Outbreak of influenza A(H7N2) among cats in an animal shelter with cat-to-human transmission--New York City, 2016. Clin Infect Dis 2017; 65:1927-9]. Influenza A(H7N2) virus was identified on 14 Dec 2016 from tissue specimens collected from a cat euthanized for severe pneumonia.

The cat had been admitted to the Manhattan facility on [12 Nov 2016] and fell ill within 2 days. Widespread transmission of influenza A(H7N2) virus occurred among cats in the Manhattan facility followed by the Brooklyn and Staten Island facilities. On 29 Dec 2016, cats from the 3 shelters were relocated to a temporary quarantine facility. By the end of the outbreak, approximately 500 cats had tested positive for influenza A(H7N2) virus; most developed mild-to-moderate illness. Influenza A(H7N2) had never before been reported in cats, raising concern of the potential role of felines as a source of infection to humans, as shelter workers had been exposed to sick cats for several weeks [First detection of avian lineage H7N2 in _Felis catus_. Genome Announc 2017; 5: e00457-17].

RT-PCR testing and genetic sequencing confirmed influenza A(H7N2) virus infection in one person during the outbreak. This was the 1st documented case of cat-to-human transmission of influenza A(H7N2) virus [Update: influenza activity--United States, 2 Oct 2016-4 Feb 2017. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2017; 66:159-66].

The above report identifies a 2nd human case based on evidence of sero-conversion, highlighting the importance of seroprevalence studies for identification of asymptomatic or mild cases of novel influenza virus infections. - Mod.UBA
