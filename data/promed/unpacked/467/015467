1st report of Asian soybean rust caused by
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ on kudzu in South Africa
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Asian soybean rust was 1st reported on soybean in
South Africa (SA) in 2001 (3). The disease has
occurred in all ensuing seasons, particularly in
the humid, eastern production regions, causing
significant losses in soybean fields not protected by fungicides.
In April 2005, rust-infected _Pueraria lobata_
(kudzu) was detected near Nelspruit, Mpumalanga,
SA. At this location (25�20'41"S, 30�43'30"E),
kudzu plants occurred abundantly on roadsides,
edges of pine plantations, and in natural
vegetation. Most vines were infected, with
abaxial surfaces of older leaves often showing
100 percent severity. Following inoculation with
rust spores collected from kudzu, soybean line
PI200492 produced tan lesions typical of a
susceptible reaction for Asian soybean rust.
Lines PI230970, PI462312, and PI459025 showed
red-brown lesions typical of a resistant reaction.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of rust
DNA extracted from primary leaves of line
PI200492 infected with spores collected from
kudzu positively identified the pathogen as
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_. PCR specific for _P.
meibomiae_ (1) did not yield a positive result.
ELISA [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay]
verified the identification of _P. pachyrhizi_ on
an original kudzu sample as well as the leaf material used for DNA analysis.
A survey of kudzu at the Nelspruit site during
July 2005 confirmed the presence of the pathogen
during the off-season for soybean. At that time,
incidence of kudzu rust remained high, but few
leaves showed high severity. The susceptibility
of kudzu to Asian soybean rust has been reported
in controlled infection studies in SA (2). To our
knowledge, this is the 1st report of _P.
pachyrhizi_ causing rust on a large, naturally
occurring kudzu population in SA.

[2] USA (Kansas): 1st report
Date: Fri 21 Sep 2007

For the 1st time ever, Asian soybean rust has
been confirmed in Kansas -- in a sentinel plot in
Montgomery County in southeast Kansas. Officials
say several hundred thousand acres of late-planted soybeans could be at risk.
Kansas State University [K-State] researchers and
the Kansas Department of Agriculture [KDA] have
confirmed that a leaf sample from a soybean plant
collected from a sentinel plot in Montgomery
County has the disease. "Asian soybean rust's
arrival in Kansas was expected," said Kansas
Secretary of Agriculture Adrian Polansky. "And,
we must continue to be vigilant, scouting for
this disease in the coming years, to ensure we
detect it early enough for growers to take action to protect their crops."
The site where the positive sample was found is
one of 20 that the USDA [United States Department
of Agriculture], working with KDA and K-State,
planted around Kansas to monitor for the disease.
"For this year [2007], this will only be a
problem in late-planted soybeans," said Kansas
State University plant pathologist Doug Jardine.
"There are 300 000 to 400 000 acres [ca. 120 000
to 180 000 hectares] of late-planted soybeans
this year [2007] that are potentially in danger.
This represents about 10 percent to 15 percent of
the state's crop." In university research trials
during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons,
measured yield losses to soybean rust ranged from
6 percent to 32 percent, Jardine said. He
anticipates that any potential yield loss in
Kansas this year [2007] in the late- planted bean
crop would likely be at the lower end of this range.
Soybean rust was 1st found in the United States 6
Nov 2004, in Louisiana. Since then, it has spread
to several states. The disease is caused by
either of 2 fungal species -- _Phakopsora
pachyrhizi_, also know as the Asian species, and
_Phakopsora meibomiae_, the New World species.
The Asian species is the more aggressive of the 2
and causes more damage to soybean plants, said
Jardine, who is the plant pathology state leader
for K-State Research and Extension. The disease
is spread by wind-borne spores capable of being
transported over long distances.
Any soybean field that has reached the R6 stage
of development (full pod fill) is no longer in
danger from the disease, Jardine said. Decisions
to apply a fungicide on fields that have not
reached that growth stage need to be made on a
field-to-field basis. The decision to spray is
dependent on a combination of growth stage,
application costs, expected selling price, and
the yield that will be saved by spraying. Given
the level of disease currently being found, yield
savings would likely be no more than about 10
percent. If a fungicide application is deemed
necessary, producers are encouraged to use a
triazole fungicide because the mode of action
will have some curative effects on infections already in progress.
Jardine said, "Areas of the field that may be
shaded, especially from the morning sun, are good
places to look for rust. Pustules will be found
on the bottom side of the leaflets and have the
appearance of small volcanoes within the lesion."
Scouting currently is more difficult in many
areas of the state, due to the presence of 2
other similar-looking diseases: brown spot and
bacterial blight, Jardine acknowledged.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was
identified in Japan in 1902 as the cause of
soybean rust. The fungus can cause premature
defoliation, with yield losses of up to 80
percent reported in Asia. It is now widespread in
Australasia and parts of Africa (South Africa
2001) and has recently been reported from a
number of countries in the Americas (USA 2004),
but data are lacking concerning its establishment
in Europe. It has a wide host range unusual for
rust fungi, and besides soybean, a number of
other species in the family of _Fabaceae_ can
also be affected. Weed species can serve as
pathogen reservoirs, and spores are spread by
wind over long distances. Fungicides may be used
in disease management and partially resistant soybean lines are available.
The less virulent related species _P. meibomiae_
is found in South America and the Caribbean and
causes rust symptoms on a similar range of hosts.
Previously, these 2 species were considered
strains of the same species, with _P. pachyrhizi_
called the very aggressive Asian strain, and _P.
meibomiae_ called the mild American strain. New
strains of _P. pachyrhizi_ with increased
virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging.
Brown spot is a fungal disease caused by
_Septoria glycines_. Bacterial blight on soybean
is caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv.
_glycinea_ or _P. savastanoi_ pv. _glycinea_
(there is still some debate whether these are
distinct species or different strains of _P. syringae_).
The system of soybean growth stages divides plant
development into vegetative (V) and reproductive
(R) stages. The vegetative stages are numbered
according to how many fully developed trifoliate
leaves are present. The reproductive (R) stages
begin at flowering and include pod development,
seed development, and plant maturation. The stages can overlap.
Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_), also called Japanese
arrowroot, is a high climbing, fast growing
leguminous vine which often completely covers
trees, shrubs, and man-made structures. It is
native to Asia where it is used as a garden
ornamental, in herbal treatments and for
basketry. Vines may extend to over 30 meters
(about 98 ft) in length with stems up to 10
centimeters (about 4 in) in diameter. Kudzu grows
well under a wide range of conditions and soil
types. It favors habitats such as forest edges,
abandoned fields, roadsides, and disturbed areas
where sunlight is abundant. Kudzu prefers mild
winters, warm summers, and high rainfall. It was
introduced as a forage plant to a number of
countries becoming a widespread weed in many areas.
