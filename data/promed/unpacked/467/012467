[With respect to the possible pathogenic [role of _C. pneumoniae_ in
atherosclerosis, we can analyse Koch's postulates [as follows.
1) The [organism is always found in the [lesions of the disease.
Muhlestein et al. demonstrated the presence of _Chlamydia_ in at least 79%
of samples of atherosclerosis through direct immunofluorescence:
Muhlestein JB, et al. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1996;27(7):1555-1561.
In the greater part of studies _Chlamydia_ has never been found in normal
artery samples:
Shor A, et al. S. Afr. Med. J. 1992;82(3):158-161
Kuo CC, et al. J. Infect. Dis. 1993;167(4):841-9
Kuo CC, et al. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993;13(10)1501-1504
Campbell LA, et al. J. Infect. Dis. 1995;172(2):585-588.
Kuo CC., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995;92(15):6911-4.
Grayston JT, et al. Circulation. 1995;92(12):3397-3400.
2) _Chlamydia pneumoniae_ can be isolated from samples of atherosclerosis
Ramirez JA, et al. Ann. Intern. Med. 1996;125:979-982
Maass M, et al. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998;31(4):827-832
3) The inoculation of _C. pneumoniae_ in experimental animals [initiates a
similar process to atherosclerosis. Nasal inoculation of _C. pneumoniae_
in rabbits provokes the appearance of lesions of atherosclerosis in these
animals:
Fong IW, et al. J. Clin. Microbiol.1997;35:48-52.
4) _C. pneumoniae_ should be isolated from samples of atherosclerosis of
animal models.

This is the only postulate of the [4 for which there is no bibliographical
reference for _Chlamydia_.

[The point being made here is that the association of _Chlamydia
pneumoniae_
with atherosclerosis is at least as strong as that between
_Helicobacter pylori_ and gastric ulcers - Mod.JW
