In Mongu, more than 56 people, including six from one family, were under
rabies treatment at the hospital after being bitten by a rabid dog at the
same time. At least seven bites were reported in the district each week
from October when the disease broke out but no deaths had been recorded.
Nobody had died because people rushed to hospitals for treatment
early.
A committee consisting of council, police, health and veterinary officers
had been formed to control the disease through vaccinations, certifications
and killing rabid dogs. Dr Bbalo complained that rabies drugs were very
expensive but the hospital in the area was doing its best to give all the
infected people some treatment. Five doses costing K45,000 [approximately
$68.00, US] were required to treat an infected person who sought medical
attention in good time.
