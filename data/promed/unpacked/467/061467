DIARRHEAL DISEASE - AFGHANISTAN: REQUEST FOR INFO
*************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

Date: 12 Nov 97 10:45:06 +0100
From: Caroline Broadhurst <broadhurst@merlin.org.uk> for Dr Besse at MERLIN
(Medical Emergency Relief International)

Following an outbreak of fatal diarrhoea (over 100 cases reported) in
Badghis province in Afghanistan which occurred early in the pistachio
picking season, we're keen to know if any one has encountered, or can
explain, severe diarrhoea and dehydration which is not thought to be of
infective origin. Possibilities may be mycotoxicosis /chemical
/conflict-related?

[Although we would not normally post an item on a disease that is thought
to be non-infectious, we do cover toxins, and anyway MERLIN is an
organization that deserves support. So please come up with ideas - Mod.JW]
