A 6th Wesley Ridge Retirement Community resident has died in the state's largest and deadliest Legionnaires' disease outbreak on record. There have been 39 confirmed cases linked to the Reynoldsburg retirement community in the past month. The ill have ranged in age from 63 to 99 and included residents, visitors and one employee.

Health officials have said more recent reports of deaths and illnesses are not a sign that there is an ongoing problem. Legionnaires' can take weeks to make a person sick. There also is lag time between the onset of symptoms and lab confirmation of the illness. Furthermore, some of those who have died had been sick for some time.

Everyone who has died was a resident of Wesley Ridge, which has taken precautions to prevent further illness and is working to rid the campus of the bacteria. There remain trace amounts of _Legionella_ in the community's Parkside building, and drinking and showering restrictions will remain until that's resolved, said Franklin County Public Health spokeswoman Mitzi Kline. Wesley Ridge has ordered showerheads approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Once those are installed, showering restrictions will be lifted, she said.

Wesley Ridge is working with federal, state and local health officials on a long-term plan for keeping _Legionella_ out of its water system. The bacteria are ubiquitous and usually harmless in the environment but cause trouble when they multiply. That can easily happen in warm, stagnant water. The bacteria sicken people who inhale tiny droplets suspended in the air, and they develop pneumonia. Those who are frail or have other medical problems are especially vulnerable to severe infections and death. Since the outbreak began, 32 people have been hospitalized with infections. None remain in the hospital, Kline said.

The investigation continues. Tests have shown that the bacteria were in water used for drinking, showering and cooking and in an air-conditioning cooling tower. So far, investigators have not been able to explain what conditions caused _Legionella_ to flourish at Wesley Ridge. The CDC has determined that bacteria found in the facility genetically match bacteria in the single patient from whom they were able to get a good sample for testing, said Ohio Department of Health spokeswoman Tessie Pollock.

In the past 5 years, the state has tracked 14 outbreaks, including 5 this year [2013]. The 2nd-largest outbreak in recent years was linked to a Dayton hospital, which sickened 11 and killed 2.

[The case count of individuals ill with Legionnaires' disease at Wesley Ridge Retirement Community has now risen from 35 when last posted (Legionellosis - USA (06): (OH) fatal, retirement community 20130801.1857205) to 39 (attack rate of 16.6 percent), and 6 have now died (case fatality rate of 15.4 percent). _Legionella_ (species not stated) were isolated from water used for drinking, showering and cooking and in an air-conditioning cooling tower. The genotype of the one clinical isolate available is reported to match the environmental genotype. Although not stated in the news release above, presumably, the genotypes of all the environmental isolates are identical.

The dates remediation of the water supply and the cooling tower were completed or the onsets of illness of the more recent cases are not given, but presumably, completion of remediation was around 25 Jul 2013, and the new cases were exposed to the contaminated water and cooling towers before remediation was complete and 1st became ill at some time during the next 14 days, since the incubation period of Legionnaires' disease is 2-14 days, and health officials apparently do not expect additional cases. We are not told of any suspected but as yet unconfirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease in the retirement community.

Wesley Ridge Retirement Community, with about 225 residents and about 10 in adult daycare, offers independent and assisted living, skilled nursing, long-term care, and rehabilitation services, inpatient and outpatient dementia care, and hospice care in a variety of building types on a campus in suburban Reynoldsburg, Ohio (http://www.wesleyridge.com/services#sthash.U8bzQfz6.dpuf).

Reynoldsburg, with a population of 35 893 in 2010, is a suburb of Columbus, the capital of and largest city in the U.S. state of Ohio. - Mod.ML
