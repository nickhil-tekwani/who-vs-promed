This year [2007], 4 people have died from hantavirus in Colorado,
including 3 this week, tying the record of fatalities from the
disease set in 1993.
The 3 most recent victims lived in rural Custer, Costilla and Park
counties, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
said Tuesday [17 Jul 2007].
Officials would not release the ages or genders of the victims. The
4th death was in Alamosa in May 2007.
There have been 61 documented cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
since the department began tracking the virus in 1993. Of those
cases, 23 have been fatal.
Hantavirus causes a respiratory disease that spreads when people
inhale dirt or dust that has been contaminated with urine and feces
of deer mice. Pape said the virus strikes mostly in rural areas,
where deer mice live.
People usually contract hantavirus after working in cabins, sheds,
barns and buildings infested with deer mice.
Besides the 4 deaths, 2 non-fatal cases have been documented this
year [2007], matching the number reported last year [2006]. In 2005,
11 cases were documented, with one death.
May, June and July are the peak months for people to contract the
virus, but Health Department officials said the recent outbreak of
fatalities is cause for concern.
Precautions include ventilating buildings that have a large
population of mice before cleaning them. Pape said a mix of one cup
of bleach in a gallon of water should be used to spray down
mice-infested areas and prevent stirring up dust.
No effective treatment exists for hantavirus, so early detection and
admission to a hospital is key. But Pape said the best approach is to
prevent sickness by looking for the "big red flag:" a surge in the
mouse population at home.

[The hantaviruses involved in these cases were not specified but
presumably are Sin Nombre virus. ProMED would appreciate further
information concerning the identity of these viruses.
