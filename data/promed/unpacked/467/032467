Abstract
-----------
_Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and _Enterobacter_ spp.
are a major cause of infections in hospitalised patients. The aim of
our study was to evaluate rates and trends of resistance to
3rd-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in infected
patients, the trends in use for these antimicrobials, and to assess
the potential correlation between both trends. The database of
national point prevalence study series of infections and antimicrobial
use among patients hospitalised in Spain over the period from 1999 to
2010 was analysed. On average, 265 hospitals and 60 000 patients were
surveyed per year yielding a total of 19 801 _E. coli_, 3004 _K.
pneumoniae_ and 3205 _Enterobacter_ isolates. During the 12-year
period, we observed significant increases for the use of
fluoroquinolones (5.8-10.2 percent, p less than 0.001), but not for
3rd-generation cephalosporins (6.4-5.9 percent, p=NS). Resistance to
3rd-generation cephalosporins increased significantly for _E. coli_
(5-15 percent, p less than 0.01) and for _K. pneumoniae_ infections
(4-21 percent, p less than 0.01) but not for _Enterobacter_ spp. (24
percent). Resistance to fluoroquinolones increased significantly for
_E. coli_ (16-30 percent, p less than 0.01), for _K. pneumoniae_ (5-22
percent, p less than 0.01), and for _Enterobacter_ spp. (6-15 percent,
p less than 0.01). We found strong correlations between the rate of
fluoroquinolone use and the resistance to fluoroquinolones,
3rd-generation cephalosporins, or co-resistance to both, for _E. coli_
(R=0.97, p less than 0.01, R=0.94, p less than 0.01, and R=0.96, p
less than 0.01, respectively), and for _K. pneumoniae_ (R=0.92, p less
than 0.01, R=0.91, p less than 0.01, and R=0.92, p less than 0.01,
respectively). No correlation could be found between the use of
3rd-generation cephalosporins and resistance to any of the latter
antimicrobials. No significant correlations could be found for
_Enterobacter_ spp. Knowledge of the trends in antimicrobial
resistance and use of antimicrobials in the hospitalised population at
the national level can help to develop prevention strategies.

[The investigators studied rates of resistance to 3rd-generation
cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in the main Enterobacteriaceae
(_Escherichia coli_, _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, and _Enterobacter_ spp.)
that were isolated from patients with both nosocomial and
community-acquired infections who were hospitalised in acute care
facilities in Spain over a 12-year period (1999-2010). They found that
increase in resistance differed among these Enterobacteriaceae.
_Enterobacter_ spp. (mainly _E. cloacae_) displayed the highest rates
of resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins, and the rates did not
increase over time, but by 2010, _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_
isolates were 3.3 and 5.3 times more frequently resistant respectively
than in 1999.

The investigators thought the difference in resistance for
_Enterobacter_ spp. could be due to the fact that the main mechanism
of resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins for _Enterobacter_ spp.
is overproduction of chromosoma l-encoded AmpC beta-lactamases,
whereas for _E. coli_ and _K. pneumoniae_ the main resistance
mechanism is the highly transmissible, plasmid-encoded,
extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). ESBLs and AmpC
beta-lactamases are enzymes elaborated by bacteria that hydrolyze many
of the extended-spectrum penicillins and cephalosporins. For a further
discussion of AmpC beta-lactamases, please see
http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/content/full/22/1/161, and for ESBLs,
https://courses.washington.edu/pharm522/Week9/2471.pdf and
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=19044.

An increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones, 3rd-generation
cephalosporins, or co-resistance to both was correlated with increased
fluoroquinolone usage for all 3 microorganisms. Co-resistance to both
fluoroquinolones and 3rd generation cephalosporins they think could be
mediated by plasmids harboring both fluoroquinolone resistance and
ESBL genes or presence of different plasmids harboring these
resistance genes.

The increasing prevalence worldwide of AmpC beta-lactamase and ESBL as
well as carbapenemase (such as the plasmid-encoded NDM-1) producing
Gram-negative bacilli constitute a challenging multifactorial problem
of great public health significance that requires continuing
surveillance and the implementation of specific evidence-based
interventions at many levels. - Mod.ML]
