Case-fatality Rates, Ebola Virus Disease, Uganda
-------------------------------------------------
According to the latest figures (31 Jan 2001), there have been 428 cases,
including 173 (40%) deaths for all of Uganda. In Gulu district there were
396 cases including 150 deaths (38%), leaving 32 cases including 23 deaths
(72%) in Masindi and Mbarara districts. This suggests to me that only the
most severe cases, most leading to death, have been detected outside Gulu
district. If so, it follows that there might have been more cases, those
less severe and undetected, outside Gulu district.

An Erroneous Reference to an Outbreak of Marburg Fever in Uganda
----------------------------------------------------------------
In the Reuters Report of Mon 16 Oct 2000
(<http://uk.news.yahoo.com/001016/80/ambmu.html>; posted and archived [by
ProMED-mail as Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Uganda 20001016.1769), it is
erroneously stated that: "The latest outbreak is the first time that Ebola
has struck in Uganda, although an outbreak of Marburg fever, which has
similar characteristics, killed 19 people there in 1976".
In fact there was no such outbreak of Marburg fever in Uganda, nor have
human cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever been recorded in Uganda at any
time up to the present. The first human case of Marburg fever in Africa was
recorded [in 1975. In 1976 there were 3 outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever; in Sudan (281 cases; 124 deaths), Zaire (318 cases; 218 deaths), and
the United Kingdom (a non-fatal laboratory accident). None of these can be
confused with the spurious 19 hemorrhagic fever deaths reported to have
occurred in Uganda in the same year. It has not been possible to establish
the source of this erroneous report.
The following is a brief chronology of confirmed outbreaks of Marburg
fever. The disease first appeared catastrophically in 1967 in a laboratory
in Marburg (Germany) handling vervet monkeys originating from Uganda. In
1967 there were 23 patients in Marburg (5 of whom died), 6 in Frankfurt,
where patients from Marburg were under care (2 of whom died), and 2 in
Belgrade (who both survived), where some monkeys from the same importation
had been sent. In total there were 32 cases and 7 deaths in this incident.
Marburg virus did not reappear again until 1975, when one of 2 young
Australians hitch-hiking in Zimbabwe developed the disease and died soon
after reaching South Africa. His companion and his nurse also developed the
disease, but both survived. (The next year in 1976 the first outbreaks of
hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola virus, which proved to be a genetically
and antigenically distinct filovirus, were recorded). In 1980 a 58 year old
Kenyan was admitted to hospital in Nairobi with Marburg hemorrhagic fever,
and died subsequently. His physician became ill, but survived. In 1987
another Marburg fever patient (from Mombasa) died in Nairobi. The next
victim of Marburg virus was a Swedish tourist returning from Kenya, who was
treated in the University Hospital in Linkoping in 1990 and survived.
The first extensive outbreak of Marburg fever occurred at Durba in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), formerly Zaire, during the period
1998/1999. A total of 103 cases were diagnosed with 69 deaths. In the next
year (2000) a further 16 cases were diagnosed at Durba-Watsa in the DRC.
Despite the proximity of Uganda and the DRC, up to the present there has
been no evidence of spread of Marburg hemorrhagic fever into Uganda. The
reservoir hosts of Ebola and Marburg viruses, and their mode of
transmission to humans, are unknown. In the outbreaks recorded so far
Marburg virus has been less lethal, and possible less contagious than Ebola
virus.

amended to remove this erroneous report, so that it is not recovered in the
course of searches for Marburg virus or Marburg fever-related information.
