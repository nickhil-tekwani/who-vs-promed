Kala-azar has killed over 30, leaders claim
------------------------------------------------
A kala-azar epidemic has killed more than 30 people over the last one
month, local leaders claimed yesterday. Speaking in Wajir town, they
claimed the disease was talking its toll on locals who are already in the
middle of a devastating drought.
Led by Assistant Minister, Mohammed Abdi Mahamoud, they appealed to the
Government and NGOs to curb further spread of the disease. Kala-azar is a
protozoan disease spread by sand flies.
Patients ailing from the disease suffer rapid loss of weight, enlarged
spleen and would bleed from all orifices and die if not treated in time.
They called for establishment of more treatment centres as the pastoralists
affected by the disease were scattered because of the prevailing drought.
The leaders also called for food donations to Kala-azar patients admitted
at Wajir Hospital and face starvation. Acting Medical Officer of Health,
Mr. Omar Somo, said the Ministry of Health has donated sufficient drugs
which, though quite expensive, will be used to treat those infected. He
said the hospital could not afford to effectively feed the in-patients who
needed a complete balanced diet during treatment. He said the number of
patients who died from the disease was not as high as claimed by the
leaders and confirmed a death toll of up to 15 people.

[ProMED-mail has previously commented on the outbreak in Wajir, and we
still presume that the diagnosis is correct although an outbreak of a
haemorrhagic fever may not be completely ruled out with regard to the
symptoms of bleeding reported in the dispatch. As pointed out in an earlier
comment, leishmaniasis is one of the infections that emerge with HIV and it
is important to know the proportion of HIV-positives among the patients
reported with leishmaniasis. - Mod.EP
