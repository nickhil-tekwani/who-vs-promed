[1] Traditional healers

President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda is insisting that traditional healers stop trying to treat suspected Ebola virus infections, following the death of a man in Kampala who previously sought help from one of these practitioners.

"The witch doctors, traditional healers and herbalists should not accept sick people in your shrines or places of treatment. Advise them to call health workers for safe transfer to hospitals," said Museveni in an address to the nation on Wednesday night [12 Oct 2022].

"Religious leaders should not accept sick people with symptoms of Ebola who come seeking healing prayers because when you touch them, you will contract Ebola," he added.

Museveni's address comes as Ugandan authorities, assisted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners, seek to contain an Ebola outbreak traced to the Sudan strain of the virus. It's the 1st time the Ebola-Sudan strain of the virus, for which there is no vaccine, has emerged in Uganda in 10 years.

As of Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], there were 54 confirmed cases of Ebola and 19 deaths.

While the Ugandan Ministry of Health has been successful in identifying cases and monitoring contacts, the response is complicated by villagers who seek out traditional healers and, in at least one case, insisted on traditional burial rites and removed a body from the authorized safe-burial teams.

Similar cultural practices were a factor in the West African Ebola outbreak of 2014, which remains the largest Ebola outbreak since the discovery of the virus in 1976. WHO remains on alert for potential Ebola spread across borders as well as within Uganda, where 5 districts are in "very high risk" status and another 20 identified as high risk.

Museveni said there are no confirmed Ebola cases in Kampala, apart from the man who traveled there after visiting a traditional healer.

"However, this event shows you the possibility of Ebola erupting in Kampala if we remain careless and defiant to medical advice," he added.

[As has been observed in past outbreaks, changing well established cultural practices is extremely difficult. Villagers do not want to go to hospitals or clinics, but instead seek out traditional healers. It may be a better approach to train the healers how to treat the patients as best they can while using proper personal safety protocols, followed by contacting health care first responders to transfer the patients. - Mod.LK]

Wonder Ebola drugs cure 20 patients in Uganda
---------------------------------------------
Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the Health minister, said with these drugs and community engagement, the country is making good progress in containing the epidemic, which has infected 54 and killed 19.

"The US government came in very quickly to provide for us trial drugs -- Remdesivir and monoclonal antibodies that we were able to offer to the health workers [who were discharged on Tue 11 Oct 2022]," she said.

The Health ministry discharged 5 health workers who recovered from Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) after undergoing treatment at Fort Portal hospital.

The health workers were taken to Fort Portal hospital on 28 Sep 2022, a few days after testing positive. They are part of 7 health workers who had operated on an Ebola patient on 15 Sep 2022 in Mubende hospital, before the outbreak was confirmed. At least 4 health workers have died of Ebola.

Dr Tony Musoke, the lead physician who was taking care of the Ebola patients, said they were able to use newer treatment options like monoclonal antibodies donated by the US government which contributed a lot to the medics' quick recovery.

"Usually Ebola Sudan virus has a very protracted course of illness, it could go above 3 weeks plus but we have seen with our colleagues we have managed to come up with much faster recoveries," he said in Entebbe at a ceremony to discharge the health workers.

Dr Aceng said the estimated case-fatality ratio for Ebola Sudan virus varies from 41% to 100% in the past outbreaks.

Dr Charles Olaro, the director of clinical services at the ministry, said they got only 7 doses of the monoclonal antibodies.

"Most of the ones we have are manufactured in the United States. There are not many factories that make monoclonal antibodies," he said.

He added: "Factories manufacture what is needed. Even if you want 1000 of them right now, you will need to go through the process of them manufacturing again and then getting the products to you. It is not like the tablets."

Dr Olaro neither revealed the number of doses of Remdesivir nor the date the US government brought the 2 drugs. The specific name of the monoclonal antibodies drug was not revealed but there are different types of monoclonal antibody drugs.

However, it is not the 1st time monoclonal antibodies are being used on Ebola patients. The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reported that in one of the studies in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), "of the 154 patients who received Inmazeb (a brand of monoclonal antibodies), 33.8% died after 28 days, compared to 51% of the 153 patients who received a control."

The health workers who recovered in Fort Portal were treated at the Joint Mobile Emerging Disease Intervention Clinical Capability (JMEDICC) centre, a clinic run under a collaboration between US and Ugandan researchers.

It is unclear whether they were keeping the medicines or they brought the drugs after the outbreak. Remdesivir was also being tested on COVID-19 patients.

Determinants of surviving Ebola
-------------------------------
Dr Paska Apio, the head of Ebola treatment at Mubende hospital, said through using drugs and other supportive care, at least 9 people have recovered from Ebola at the facility.

"There are still no approved drugs for the treatment of Ebola. All these are investigational drugs. People can survive Ebola even without getting those medicines," she said.

She added: "But this depends on how quickly somebody comes to the facility and other comorbidities that we have and how your body fights off the infections. I have seen at least 9 people in Mubende recover from Ebola."

Dr Stephen Ataro, a clinical epidemiologist who participated in past Ebola response, said a person's immune system is a strong determinant for survival.

"If you have strong immunity then chances of survival are higher but if you have chronic illnesses like cancer, kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, those ones give you low chances of survival," he said.

This is because the disease affects the same organs that are already having complications.

"If you are in contact and before you develop symptoms you were started on supportive care, then the chances of survival are higher. The ability of the treatment centre also plays an important role, like the availability of antibiotics, oxygen if needed, blood transfusion services," Dr Ataro said.

He added: "All those are things that make you survive if initiated early. If you are in a rural area with no advanced technology in the health facility, the chance of survival is low."

[It has not been stated which monoclonal antibodies are being tested. One monoclonal antibody is Inmazeb, which was used against Ebola Zaire.

Inmazeb is an antiviral drug combination of 3 recombinant human IgG1Îº monoclonal antibodies (atoltivimab, maftivimab, and odesivimab) that inhibit Zaire ebolavirus.

"Inmazeb is indicated for the treatment of infection caused by Zaire ebolavirus in adult and pediatric patients, including neonates born to a mother who is RT-PCR positive for Zaire ebolavirus infection."

"Limitations of Use: The efficacy of Inmazeb has not been established for other species of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera." (https://www.drugs.com/pro/inmazeb.html)

"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an investigational broad-spectrum antiviral drug that has demonstrated activity against ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses of several families, including Coronaviridae (such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and strains of bat coronaviruses), Paramyxoviridae (such as Nipah virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Hendra virus), and Filoviridae (such as EBOV)."

[However], "despite potent in vitro activity against EBOV and unprecedented success in animal models of EVD, the journey of remdesivir for human EVD culminated in disappointing results." (Pardo J, Shukla AM, Chamarthi G, Gupte A. The journey of remdesivir: from Ebola to COVID-19. Drugs Context. 22 May 2020;9:2020-4-14. doi: 10.7573/dic.2020-4-14.) That being said, it does look like remdesivir shows promise against Ebola Sudan virus. - Mod.LK]

[3] Kampala cases

Two Ebola cases keep Kampala in crosshairs
------------------------------------------
The Health ministry has linked the 2 cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Kampala to initial cases of the disease in Mubende District, the epicentre.

One of the patients, a 45-year-old man from Mubende, died at Kiruddu hospital in Kampala this week after escaping from Mubende, where he had been listed as a contact and was being followed up.

The 2nd patient, the wife of the 45-year-old man, tested positive for Ebola after delivering at Kitebi Health Centre IV in Kampala.

At least 42 contacts of the patients have been listed in Kampala and more than 10 health workers, who handled the 2 patients, have been isolated at the Mulago isolation centre.

"She is a listed contact of her husband, but also a contact to her husband's brother. She was listed as a contact in Mubende and, therefore, remains a case of Mubende," Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the Health minister, said.

Dr Rosemary Byanyima, the acting director of Mulago National Referral Hospital, said the hospital is safe and is providing care to all patients.

"The isolation unit is a stand-alone facility, separate from the lower and upper Mulago. I don't know the number of people who are isolated there because it is under the Ebola taskforce," she said.

Although many people have questioned the relevance of listing the 2 patients as cases of Mubende and not Kampala, Dr Aceng and President Museveni are sticking with their position.

The cases in Kampala have triggered anxiety among the city dwellers and people intending to come to the city, a development that could affect business and slow down recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Unless Kampala generates its own cases that start within Kampala, we cannot call that a Kampala case," Dr Aceng reasoned before urging the public to remain calm and vigilant.

The President, during his address to the nation on Wednesday [12 Oct 2022], said: "There has been a lot of rumours and anxiety about confirmed cases of Ebola in Kampala City, specifically Kiruddu hospital. I would like to inform the general public that there is no confirmed case of Ebola in Kampala City."

Since the 20 Sep 2022 outbreak declaration, 55 confirmed cases and 19 deaths have been reported by the Health ministry. Up to 20 people have also recovered from the deadly disease. The ministry's data for the deaths exclude those who died before the outbreak was confirmed. The Ministry of Health has not yet determined the index case (the 1st person to contract EVD during this fresh outbreak).

Dr Henry Mwebesa, the director general of Health Services, said the contacts of the 45-year-old who died at Kiruddu hospital have tested negative for Ebola "but we want to give them a 2nd trial."

Dr Mwebesa added: "The family of the man who died has been isolated in Madudu Sub-county in Mubende."

Up to 17 of the 19 EVD deaths are from Mubende as per the government statistics. But cases have been reported in Kyegegwa, Kassanda, Bunyangabo and Kagadi.

... "Health officials have not commented on the status of the baby born to the woman who tested positive.

"The health workers who attended the birth are under medical observation in an isolation facility at Kampala's main hospital where they will remain for the next 21 days, Aceng said."

"Outbreaks are difficult to contain, especially in urban environments.

"Life has continued as normal in Kampala, though some schools have introduced hand washing facilities that became widespread during the coronavirus pandemic."

"Uganda's last recorded fatality from a previous Ebola outbreak was in 2019. ..." - Mod.LK
