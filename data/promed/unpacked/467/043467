PARALYTIC SHELLFISH POISONING, HUMAN - VIET NAM (02): correction

In a recent report of paralytic shellfish poisoning in Vietnam
(ProMED-mail post 20060621.1717), the moderator's comments after the
report stated more than once that "paralytic shellfish poisoning is
not associated with crabs and prawns". This is incorrect. Paralytic
shellfish poisoning can be caused by several filter-feeding species
of crabs that accumulate the toxins from harmful algal blooms.
This phenomenon was first reported in 1932 by Sommer (Sommer, H. The
occurrence of paralytic shellfish poison in the common sand crab.
Science 76, 574-575).
Another group of crabs which are not filter-feeders and where the
origin of the paralytic shellfish toxins remains something of a
mystery, have been the cause of human deaths who have inadvertently
eaten these crabs prepared in a variety of manners including in soups.
These groups of crabs are in the family Xanthidae and several species
are always toxic and often contain enough toxin to kill many
people. Most of these crab poisoning events have been restricted to
the tropics.
There are an extensive number of scientific publications on paralytic
shellfish poisons in crustaceans and the human poisonings that they cause.

[I a grateful to Mr. Llewellyn for enlightening me regarding a
publication from 1932 that I have clearly missed reading. The
information that he cites was not in any of the reference texts that
I had the ability to check. It is always nice when our readers help
keep us up-to-date. My apologies for the incorrect statements. - Mod.TG]
