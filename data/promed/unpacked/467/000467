Yellow fever in Liberia - Update
---------------------------------
As of 6 Sep 2000, a total of 102 suspected cases of yellow fever were
reported by the Liberian Ministry of Health. No confirmed cases have
occurred outside the Grand Cape Mount County area, which lies on the border
with Sierra Leone, nor in other parts of the country, including Monrovia.
WHO has provided 180 000 doses of yellow fever virus vaccine and
auto-destruct syringes to the Liberian Ministry of Health. WHO, working
with non-governmental organizations in the area, began a campaign to
vaccinate the 150 000 people at risk in the region on 5 Sep 2000. It was
planned to complete vaccinated of 60 000 people by 10 Sep 2000. In addition
WHO will provide additional doses of vaccine to conduct "catch up"
campaigns for non-immune populations outside the affected area.

[Although the number of suspected cases of yellow fever had increased from
the 29 reported on 16 Aug 2000, the outbreak appears to be confined to the
Grand Cape Mount area of Liberia. There have been no reports of spread
across the border into Sierra Leone. A well-organized vaccination campaign
is now underway. ProMED-mail will not continue to report on the course of
this outbreak, unless it spreads beyond its present bounds. -Mod.CP
