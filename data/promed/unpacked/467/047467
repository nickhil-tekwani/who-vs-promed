The 1st case of Buruli ulcer has been recently confirmed in the Central
African Republic (CAR) from a 16-year-old woman with a chronic ulcer of the
leg, living in the Mbaiki area (southern part of CAR).
This case of Buruli ulcer was confirmed by direct examination (Ziehl-
Neelsen staining) [which stain mycobacteria as "acid-fast" - Mod.LL] and
polymerase chain reaction at the Pasteur Institut of Bangui, CAR.
Until now, this infectious disease had never been confirmed in CAR. A
prospective survey will be conducted around the affected area.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bercion for this personal report.
_Mycobacterium ulcerans_ infection (Buruli ulcer) is the 3rd most common
mycobacterial disease worldwide in immunocompetent humans after leprosy and
tuberculosis. It was 1st described by Sir Albert Cook in patients from
Buruli County in Uganda. _M. ulcerans_ is an environmental mycobacterium
and has been recovered from water and soil in swampy areas. The disease is
not known to be contagious between humans, and epidemiological studies have
not yet established natural reservoirs or modes of transmission, though
abrasions of the dermis and minor skin trauma after contact with
contaminated water, soil, or vegetation could be likely routes of entry.
Various clinical forms may develop after _M. ulcerans_ enters through the
skin: localized necrotizing skin ulcers; contiguous dissemination over
extensive body surfaces; and metastatic spread of _M. ulcerans_ to distant
sites, usually skin and bone. Minor forms heal spontaneously, ordinarily in
3-6 months by a delayed-type hypersensitivity response, followed by
scarring. Devastating sequelae (scarring or amputations) often ensue from
tissue destruction and osteomyelitis.
A picture of a Buruli ulcer can be found at:

Endemic foci exist throughout the world, predominantly in tropical rain
forest areas. The peak incidence of the disease coincides with the rainfall
pattern and farming season in endemic districts. This lends credence to
speculation that disease onset is related to farming activities, which
predispose to injury and pricks.
Mbaiki (also spelled Mbaki or M'Baiki) is the capital of Lobaye, one of the
14 prefectures of the Central African Republic. Its location can be found at:

The area borders Congo, where the infection has been previously reported. -
