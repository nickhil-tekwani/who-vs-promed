At least 20 people have been killed by cholera following a recent outbreak of the disease in parts of Nigeria's northeast state of Bauchi, an official said on Tuesday [25 May 2021].

Speaking at a news conference in Bauchi city, the state capital, Aliyu Maigoro, the state commissioner of health, said the state has instituted several control measures to combat the outbreak which has [killed] at least 20 people since April 2021.

Maigoro said the index case was a 37-year-old housewife, who was admitted at a hospital on 24 Apr 2021 in Ningi local government area. "Upon her admission, it was discovered there is an ongoing outbreak of the similar disease in neighboring communities," said Maigoro, adding the disease has been found in 9 local government areas in the state, and more than 300 people have been infected.

He said measures are in place to contain the spread, including mounting continuous surveillance for all epidemic-prone diseases as well as active search for cases of diarrhea and vomiting.

Cholera is a highly virulent disease characterized in its most severe form by a sudden onset of acute watery diarrhea that can lead to death by severe dehydration. The outbreak is common in Nigeria due to the poor water supply systems, especially in densely populated areas.

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (2,3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in the WHO reference below (6). Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
