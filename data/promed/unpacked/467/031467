Due to an error in a temporary heating system for the hot water
supply in 3 multifamily residences in Rheinfelden, Switzerland, up to
30 persons became ill with Pontiac fever, a milder form of legionellosis.
Regional health officials were informed on 14 Jul 2006 about the
occurrence of the disease. According to the head of the official lab,
one person was definitely diagnosed with legionellosis. The reason
for the spread of the disease was a problem with a circulating pump
for the hot water system. Infection probably occurred by breathing
steam while taking a shower. According to the health official, a
cluster of legionellosis is seldom seen in the region.
The regional official lab has the mandate for decontamination of the
hot water supply system in the multifamily residences. Water samples
from the apartments will be taken on 18 Aug 2006 to assure complete
decontamination. Health officials will be convinced that
legionellosis is under control then.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Scharer for the contribution and his translation
from the original German.
Pontiac fever, originally described as a self-limited upper
respiratory illness without pneumonia, was subsequently shown to be
caused by the _Legionella_ bacterium after the organism was described.
Aargau is one of the more northerly cantons of Switzerland, bordering
on Germany. It comprises the lower course of the river Aare, which is
why the canton is called Aargau (meaning Aare district). A map of
Switzerland highlighting the canton can be found at:
