The Ministry of Health of Chad is launching an emergency mass-vaccination campaign against yellow fever from 22 Feb 2013, following laboratory confirmation of 2 cases in the country in December 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a dispatch obtained by PANA Thursday [14 Feb 2013].

The vaccination campaign will be conducted in 3 districts bordering Darfur, Sudan, namely Goz Beida, Guereda, and Adre, targeting over a million people, including inhabitants of refugee camps in the area.

The campaign is supported by the Chad's Ministry of Health, the International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG11), and GAVI Alliance.

The 2 cases from Goz Beida and Guereda districts were confirmed by a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, Institut Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal.

They were identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever following intensive surveillance which was triggered in response to the outbreak of yellow fever in neighbouring Sudan's Darfur region.

The intensive surveillance in Chad also reported 139 suspected cases and 9 deaths.

[It is not clear why this announcement was so late in coming out, given that the cases occurred in December 2012. Also, it is not clear whether the 139 suspected cases and 9 fatal cases were contracted in the same area of Chad, along the Darfur border, as the 2 fatal cases reported above. These cases are very likely spill-over from the YF outbreak in western or northern Darfur. The gold mines in Darfur had workers from other countries, most likely some from Chad, that might have contracted YF virus infections and returned home and died there.
