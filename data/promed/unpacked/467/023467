The Araucania Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat] confirmed a new hantavirus death in the region. The case is a 62-year-old man, a farmer in the Angol community, who was attended on 9 Nov [2015] in the hospital in this city due to feeling ill, and then sent to the Las Higueras Hospital in Talcahuano donde where he finally died.

The sample was sent to the Molecular Virology Laboratory of the Austral University of Chile in Valdivia, where the presence of hantavirus was confirmed. [This is a reference laboratory located in the endemic region. - Mod.TY]. The Health SERMI sub-head, Gloria Cueva, indicated that the 3 people who have died this year [in 2015 of a hantavirus infection] lived in rural areas.

To date, 8 cases have been confirmed in Araucania, from the Lautaro, Collipulli, Tolten, Gorbea [1 case each], Vilcun (2 cases) and Angol (2 cases) communities, of whom 3 have died. According to case distribution, 76 percent are rural residents, 18 percent visited the countryside, and 6 percent worked in those areas.

[As noted in previous reports from Chile, cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. The diagnostic system has been substantially improved. Rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical because of the speed with which the disease can progress and the urgency of proper treatment. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/ecologia_enfermedad/galeria_reservorio.htm.
