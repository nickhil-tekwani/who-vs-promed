The Department of Health in Samar [province] warned the public against chikungunya virus infection and encouraged local government units to conduct search and destroy operations against _Aedes_ mosquitoes.

Of 28 cases of fever, rashes and joint pains reported in Barangay [neighborhood] Guintarcan of Villareal, Samar, 10 were confirmed to have chikungunya, a viral infection transmitted by infected _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ female mosquitoes.

The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine is also investigating 235 other cases with the same symptoms reported in Barangay Banquil, also in Villareal.

The DOH has recorded confirmed cases of chikungunya in Samar, Laguna, Pangasinan, Saranggani and Metro Manila. No death has so far beem reported, but health authorities are now undertaking measures to stop its spread.

Chikungunya [virus infection] was 1st described during an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1952. It is an alphavirus of the family Togaviridae. The name "chikungunya" derives from the Kimakonde language and means "to become contorted," describing the stooped appearance of those suffering from joint pain.

In September last year [2012], National Epidemiology Center head Dr. Enrique Tayag said chikungunya [disease] is not as deadly as dengue but should merit the same urgency from doctors and patients.

[If there are over 200 cases of chikungunya virus infections in Villareal in recent days, this begins to look like a significant outbreak. There were sporadic outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections last year (2012) in various parts of the Philippines. Chikungunya virus is doubtless endemic in the Philippines, having caused sporadic outbreaks in 1954, 1956, 1968, and 1985 to 1986 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120929.1315954), mainly in the center and south areas of the country. Since there is no commercially available vaccine, the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
