[1] Bed nets for dengue control
Date: Wed 23 Oct 2014
From: Frederick Pages <frederic.pages@ars.sante.fr> [edited]


In this last post on dengue fever in Asia [ProMED-mail archive no. 20131023.2016569], your moderator failed to find anything in the literature to support the use of bed nets as a primary means of control of dengue fever transmission. In the paper below, the use of impregnated bed nets in Haiti seemed to decrease transmission. In another way, the use of impregnated curtains against dengue vectors has already been assessed in South America [and Yucatan, Mexico].

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pages for calling the following reference to our attention.

Reference:
Lenhart A, Orelus N, Maskill R, Alexander N, Streit T, McCall PJ. Insecticide-treated bednets to control dengue vectors: preliminary evidence from a controlled trial in Haiti. Trop Med Int Health. 2008 Jan;13(1):56-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3156.2007.01966.x.

Methods: A cluster-randomized trial was carried out in Leogane, Haiti between July 2003 and July 2004. The study area (1017 houses) was divided into 18 sectors (clusters): 9 received ITNs (Olyset long-lasting insecticidal bednets), and 9 were untreated controls. Entomological surveys [measuring Breteau (BI), house (HI), container (CI) and pupae per person (PPI) indices and oviposition activity] were undertaken at baseline and at one and 5 months post-intervention. All houses were georeferenced to enable spatial analysis. Control sectors received ITNs at 6 months, and a final entomological and attitudinal survey was undertaken at 12 months after baseline. Anti-dengue IgM seropositivity rates were measured at baseline and after 12 months. Efficacy of ITNs was assessed by WHO cone bioassays.

Results: At 1-month post-intervention, entomological indices fell in all sectors, with HI and BI in the bed net sectors reduced by 6.7 (95 percent CI 10.6, 2.7; P under 0.01) and 8.4 (95 percent CI 14.1, 2.6; P under 0.01), respectively. Moreover, at one month, ovitraps in control sectors were significantly more likely to be positive than in bednet sectors (P under 0.01). By 5 months, all indices remained low and HI, CI and BI were also significantly lower than that of baseline in the control arm. Curiously, at 5 months, HI, CI and BI were lower in the control arm than that in the bednet arm. A final survey, 12 months after the initial baseline study (5 months after bednets had been given to all households) indicated that all indices were significantly lower than that at baseline (P under 0.001). Control houses located within 50 meters of a bednet house had significantly lower CI (Z = 2.67, P = 0.008) and PPI (Z = 2.19, P = 0.028) at one month, an effect that extended to 100 meters by 5 months (Z = 2.03, P = 0.042 and Z = 2.37, P = 0.018, respectively), suggesting a spill-over effect of the bednets. An IgM serosurvey showed a 15.3 percent decrease (95 percent CI 5.0-25.5 percent, P under 0.01) in the number of IgM-positive individuals from baseline to 12 months later.

Conclusions: Insecticide-treated bednets had an immediate effect on dengue vector populations after their introduction, and over the next 5-12 months, the presence of ITNs may have continued to affect vector populations and dengue transmission.

Although _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus vector mosquitoes are day-time feeders, the treated bednets were effective in reducing abundance of these mosquitoes in houses and may prove to be a cost effective control measure as impregnated curtains have proved to be in Yucatan, Mexico. This approach appears to merit additional field trials. - Mod.TY]
