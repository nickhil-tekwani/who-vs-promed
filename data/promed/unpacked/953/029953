Hendra virus
---------------
CSIRO [Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization
Animal Health scientists have discovered more about the mysterious
Hendra disease that killed two humans and fifteen horses in
Queensland in two outbreaks in 1994-95.
Scientist Dr Mark Williamson says research at the CSIRO's Australian
Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong has shown that while
Hendra virus is not highly contagious, it is often deadly if an
infection occurs.
Formerly known as the equine morbillivirus, Hendra virus has been
shown to infect humans, horses, cats and guinea pigs. Fruit bats
(also called flying foxes) are thought to be the natural 'host' of
the virus. The research findings are published in the Australian
Veterinary Journal, December 14.

"Basic research and understanding of this virus will be critical if
there are ever further outbreaks of the disease. But perhaps of
greater importance, is that the basic understanding gained through
the research can be applied to other viruses," Dr Williamson says.
CSIRO research demonstrates that horses can be infected by eating
material contaminated with the virus, and that transmission from cat
urine to horses can occur. Horses, cats and guinea pigs excrete the
virus in their urine. Most importantly, the research also shows the
virus was not carried on the breath of horses.
AAHL scientists first identified Hendra virus after tissue samples
were rushed from Queensland during an outbreak of the mystery disease
in Hendra [near Birsbane in 1994, in which one human and thirteen
horses died. The scientists showed the disease was not an exotic
(foreign) disease, but was in fact a newly recognized virus that had
not previously been identified. One person and two horses died in a
later outbreak in Mackay in 1994-95. There have been no further
outbreaks of the disease since that time.
Hendra virus produces both lung and brain disease, consistent with
related viruses such as canine distemper and measles. Dr Williamson
also noted that during the four-year research program into the Hendra
virus, two previously unknown diseases also associated with bats have
been identified in Australia.
Australian bat lyssavirus
------------------------------
The Australian bat lyssavirus [Ballina virus was identified in 1996
after samples from a sick bat were sent to AAHL for testing for
Hendra virus. Tests in fact showed that the disease was caused by a
close relative of rabies; [rabies virus does not occur in Australia.
Two people are known to have died after infection with Ballina virus.
A Rockhampton (Queensland) bat carer died from the illness in 1996. A
second fatality occurred [Sunday, with the death of a woman from
Mackay (Queensland) who was bitten by an infected bat two years ago.
Menangle virus
------------------
The [third bat virus, known as the Menangle virus, was first
isolated in 1997 by New South Wales Agriculture after pig illness and
miscarriage in a NSW piggery, and influenza-like symptoms occurred in
piggery workers. The Menangle virus is also carried by fruit bats.
"The number of 'new' viruses discovered in Australia this decade
means that this type of basic research is even more important. It
[requires that we maintain our skills in dealing with newly emerging
diseases," Dr Williamson said.

[To summarize:
Hendra virus = paramyxovirus (they will suggest it be reclassified
into a new genus): bats, horses, humans
Ballina virus = lyssavirus: bats, humans (let's hope not dogs and
cats, too)
Menangle virus = ungrouped: bats, pigs, humans
