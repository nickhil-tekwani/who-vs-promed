A society engaged in the salvage of unowned/stray animals in the Valleys region [northern Israel] has been keeping a large number of cats and dogs on its premises. During an inspection visit of the commissioner [footnote 1] on the site, serious shortcomings in the performance of the society were encountered, the animals being kept under harsh conditions and in poor bodily condition. This led to a decision to transfer the animals to a "protected installation" [footnote 2].

During further veterinary investigations [in the protected installation], it was found that the animals suffer from extreme emaciation, weakness, and several diseases, including ehrlichiosis, hepatozoonosis, demodicosis, scabies, and visceral leishmaniosis (VL) [infection by _L. infantum_]. Serological and PCR tests for _L. infantum_ followed; it was established that about 45% of the dogs and 78% of the cats were found positive.

Such an event, including dozens of exposed and infected animals, presenting a high [VL] infection rate within a single location is, epidemiologically, most exceptional; in Israel, it is regarded to be the 1st of its kind.

Following consultations with the Ministry of Health, and in view of advice from experts stating that the adoption of such animals by members of the public may cause a spread of the disease and become a public health hazard, even life threatening (in particular in relation to people with impaired immune systems and to juveniles/babies), and despite the desire to save and rehabilitate the rescued animals, a joint position was formed between the ministries of agriculture and health according to which the animals should be euthanized. However, the final decision is to be made by the court following a petition by the Noa'h organization [footnote 3].

Additional information on VL in dogs is available at http://www.leishvet.org.

1. Commissioner: a veterinarian, an employee of the Veterinary Services in an office appointed by the director for the purposes of the Animal Welfare (Protection of Animals) Law, 5754-1994.
2. Protected installation: a place approved by the commissioner under section 8 (c) of the (said) law.
3. Noa'h (No'ach): the Israeli Federation of Animal Protection Societies.

For the full text of Israel's Animal Welfare (Protection of Animals) Law, 5754-1994, see https://www.nevo.co.il/Law_html/law01/p200m2_002.htm (in Hebrew).

The (unpopular) decision of both ministries to euthanize the animals, most of them VL infected, was taken while (justifiably) prioritising public health over other considerations. However, animal welfare arguments were not neglected.

The lamentable health condition of the (around 100, according to media reports) cats and dogs confiscated from the Girgurim facility in the valley of Yezreel was clearly related to the poor sanitary conditions, as visualized in one of the earlier media reports (https://www.maariv.co.il/news/israel/Article-658987).

According to the data included in the Ministry of Health's monthly report, the annual numbers of reported cases of VL in human patients in Israel between 2006 and 2017 were, respectively, the following: 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 7, 6, 7, 3, 7. It may be assumed that the situation in the West Bank and the Gaza strip (Palestinian Authority) is similar.

The following comment by Mod.EP was included in posting 20120925.1308324 (Sep 2012):
"Visceral leishmaniasis, VL, caused by _Leishmania infantum_, has returned to Israel after being absent for 30 years, with dogs as the main reservoir" (Refs 1, 2).
