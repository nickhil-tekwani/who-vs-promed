From 1995 to date there have been 18 cases of hantavirus infections in the Valparaiso region, 14 of which were fatal and 3 of these occurred in the past year [2016] in Quillota province, one fatal; for this the call issued for cleanup and individual precautions.

Due to this, the Subchief of the Health SEREMI [local ministerial administrative unit], Mario Mendez, gave some advice to avoid infection in rural areas while camping or in agricultural activities.

"What we suggest is that before cleaning up outbuildings or houses, ventilate them well, apply bleach and afterward sweep or clean," he indicated.

[Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and this only occurs with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.

A 45-year-old forest worker is hospitalized in the Las Condes Clinic in the metropolitan region; he is the 3rd confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Bio region. He is progressing well.

The man, a resident of the Santa Barbara community in Bio Bio province, was involved in a camp that was not authorized. This is the place where possibly he was infected by the virus, explained the SEREMI epidemiologist Cecilia Soto.

The work is going on to monitor his family members and contacts in the Quilaco area where they might have been exposed.

With this case there are now 3 cases in the area. One of these is currently in serious but stable condition in the Las Higueras Hospital in Talcahuano. The other case is a 69-year-old man, from the Arauco community, who died from the virus [infection], raising the case fatality rate to 33 percent this year [2017].

As far as the forest fires are concerned, Cecilia Soto stated that there is no direct consequence to the occurrence of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat [the rodent host of Andes virus] in the vicinity because in previous years it has been established that, "displacement [of the rodents] in the vicinity of the affected areas by fires is not more than 200-300 meters [556-984 ft] from the perimeter of the damaged area."

The official also signaled that the accumulation of garbage and trash permits the presence of colonies of long-tailed pygmy rice rats; cleanup of urban and peri-urban areas is the responsibility of the municipality.

Bear in mind that hantavirus [infections cause] is an acute respiratory disease that can rapidly lead to death. Thus, it is important in springtime to take precautions to avoid the infection.

There are 2 suspected cases of hantavirus [infections] admitted to the Esquel hospital and it was stated that their samples have been sent to the Malbran Institute in Buenos Aires and are in process for confirmation. Results will come in a few days.

"The risk that we face is for the populace that lives in the area and for tourists; because of this we always recommend that if they decide to camp, they choose clean areas where safe areas for visitors are offered" said Radio el Chubut.

As for the suspected cases, Biondo states that they are patients from the Andean region and are under observation due to their seriousness as indicated by their clinical picture. Although not confirmed, "they are suspected cases that are compatible with the disease."

This information about a hantavirus [infection] case came to light after El Patagonico published its Tuesday edition. The case is a 27-year-old woman who is hospitalized with a reserved prognosis in Esquel after having contracted the disease in El Bolson, Rio Negro while on vacation.

The specialist recalled that in 2012, there was a massive bloom of colihue cane, so that [preventive] measures applied were even more extreme because of the presence of great numbers of rodents due to the food source from the seeds provided by this plant species. "This is not an alarming situation, rather a usual endemic situation and the idea is to prevent [infections] and not alarm people," he said.

[This area is in the Andean area where Andes virus is endemic in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Rat populations increase when the colihue cane booms and sets seeds.
