Cambodian girl dies from bird flu: WHO confirmed
------------------------------------------------
A 4-year-old Cambodian girl has become the 7th person to die from bird
flu in the country this year [2011], officials said on Friday [29 Jul
2011]. The child, from north-western Banteay Meanchey province died on
20 Jul 2011, the Health Ministry and the World Health Organization
(WHO) said in a joint statement. Tests confirmed she had contracted
H5N1 avian influenza.

"I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead
poultry," Cambodian health minister Mam Bun Heng said.

All 7 of Cambodia's bird flu cases since January [2011] have been
fatal. 6 of the victims were children. The girl is the 17th person in
Cambodia known to have become infected with the virus and the 15th to
die from complications of the disease since 2005, they said.

The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has killed 330 people worldwide
since 2003, the statement said.
