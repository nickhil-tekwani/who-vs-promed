A Glenwood Springs man contracted Colorado's third case of hantavirus this
year, officials confirmed earlier this week, but the man has already
recovered from the frequently fatal disease.
State epidemiologist Richard Hoffman said it's not known when the man, who
is in his mid-40s, was infected. The unidentified man was hospitalized on
June 10 and was discharged Wednesday.
