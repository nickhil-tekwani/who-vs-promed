A total of 4 patients have been infected by _Listeria_ and one has died after eating potentially contaminated cheese at a hospital in Switzerland.

During an internal check, Kaeserei Vogel AG, based in Steinerberg, found _Listeria_ in semi-hard cheese and at its production site. The company issued a recall and informed its buyers to remove the products from shelves. One of the buyers is a supplier to the Centre Hospitalier du Valais Romand (CHVR). This supplier told the CHVR purchasing manager on [30 Apr 2020] about the problem. He instructed the immediate withdrawal of implicated cheeses. The last delivery was [8 Apr 2020], but it has not been ruled out that previous lots were also contaminated.

From [30 Mar to 2 Apr 2020], a diagnosis of invasive listeriosis infection was made in 4 CHVR patients who could have contracted illness from eating these cheeses during their hospital stays. According to information from meal cards, the infected patients did consume cheese during their hospitalization but it is not possible to be certain that it was the cheeses in question. 3 of the people have recovered but one person with underlying health conditions has died.

Kaeserei Vogel informed the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO) in Switzerland about the contamination.

FSVO, also known by its French acronym OSAV, Italian name USAV, and under the German name BLV, told people not to consume the products concerned by the recall as they may pose a health hazard.

More than 20 items including sheep and goat cheese, brie, and organic cheese sold across Switzerland have been recalled by the company. Cheeses can be identified as they have number CH-5707 on the packaging. Distribution also includes Belgium and Germany, according to the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) portal.

Denner, a supermarket in Switzerland, has recalled all expiration dates of "Denner Fromage de montagne de la Suisse centrale" because of detection of _Listeria_ at the site of the dairy producer.

Migros, another retailer in the country, recalled all batches of 5 cheese products sold at different stores because of the problem.

Food contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_ may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections. Anyone who has eaten any of the recalled products and developed symptoms of _Listeria_ infection should seek medical treatment and tell their doctors about the possible _Listeria_ exposure.

Also, anyone who has eaten any of the recalled product should monitor themselves for symptoms during the coming weeks because it can take up to 70 days after exposure to _Listeria_ for symptoms of listeriosis to develop.

Symptoms of _Listeria_ infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache, and neck stiffness. Specific laboratory tests are required to diagnose _Listeria_ infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people such as cancer patients who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

[The news article above reports that a cheese manufacturer, Kaserei Vogel AG, based in Steinerberg, a town in central Switzerland, found _Listeria_ in semi-hard cheese and at its production site. One of their buyers was the Sion Hospital (part of the Centre Hospitalier du Valais Romand). The city of Sion (population 35 000 residents) is the capital of the canton of Valais, in southwestern Switzerland (https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sion,+Switzerland). From 30 Mar to 2 May 2020, 4 patients were infected by _Listeria_ and 1 died after eating potentially contaminated cheese during their hospital stays. More than 20 items including sheep and goat cheese, brie, and organic cheese are sold in Switzerland and identified by number CH-5707 on the packaging. Distribution also included Belgium and Germany.

We are not told if any of the implicated cheeses were made from raw milk or the aging process for these cheeses. Typically, semi-hard cheeses are aged anywhere between one and six months depending on type. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rule requires cheese made from unpasteurized milk to age for a minimum of 60 days before sale. Disease-causing pathogens are thought not to survive the acidifying process of aging for more than the 2-month aging process (https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/02/is-the-60-day-rule-still-valid-for-raw-milk-cheese/). Of course, even if made from pasteurized milk, the cheese could have become contaminated with _Listeria_ as a result of environmental contamination at the production site.

The news report says that it is not known if the cheese eaten by the 4 patients was the _Listeria_-contaminated cheese produced by Kaeserei Vogel AG. However, if genotyping is done and genotypes of the 4 patient isolates match each other, then a common source outbreak can be established, and if the genotype of the outbreak strain matches that of the cheese isolate, then the source can be established. More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
