Two positive cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, have been reported from Aralagodu Gram Panchayat [village council] limits in Sagar taluk [an administrative division] in the past week.

Kiran S.K., Field Medical Officer of KFD, told The Hindu that the blood samples of a 40-year-old woman and a 29-year-old man from Aralagodu have tested positive for KFD. Both were admitted to McGann Hospital, a government hospital attached to Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences, for treatment and were on the path to recovery. Their health is being closely monitored, he said.

Following this, a vaccination drive against KFD has been undertaken in Nallimakki, Marabeedu, Nandodi, Bannumane, Yademane, Vatemakki, Mundavalli, Kasaguppe, Bidarur, Jaddinamane villages that fall in the radius of 5 km [3.19 miles] from Aralagodu. In the past week, as many as 1800 persons have been vaccinated in these villages.

In addition to this, the vaccination has been administered in December 2018 to as many as 17 000 persons in Tirthahalli taluk, 6000 persons in Sorab taluk, and 2500 persons in Hosanagar taluk, where the disease was reported in 2017.

Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Family Welfare has requested the Department of Forest and Wildlife to bring to its notice any cases of unnatural death of monkeys in the forest. In the past 10 days, as many as 11 monkeys have died in the forest near Avinahalli village in Sagar taluk; 3 monkeys died in the forest near Kattehakkalu in Tirthahalli taluk.

Blood samples and viscera of the dead monkeys have been sent for tests. If they test positive for KFD, a vaccination drive will be launched in the villages in the vicinity to prevent outbreak of the disease.

KFD is a tick-borne viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans through tick bites. High fever, aching joints, and bleeding gums are some of the symptoms of the disease. In 2017, 4 people died due to KFD in the district, and 48 positive cases were reported during this period. In many cases, persons who venture into forests to collect firewood or graze their cattle contract the disease through tick bites.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is caused by Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the virus family Flaviviridae. KFDV was identified in 1957 when it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka (formerly Mysore) State, India (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

Transmission of the virus to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described. Stringent bio-safety measures have to be ensured while disposing of any dead monkeys in KFD-endemic areas in India.

The last report of KFD cases from Karnataka state was received in March 2018 [ProMED post Kyasanur Forest disease - India (08): (KA) 20180319.5695348]. KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease.

Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to preventing KFD. There is a need to create community awareness on how to avoid tick bites, and KFD vaccination facilities should be extended in the affected areas as mentioned in the report. Also, efforts at animal surveillance for KFD should be undertaken as early warning for risk of human infections. - Mod.UBA
