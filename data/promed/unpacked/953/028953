History repeats itself. An article entitled "Lawnmower tularemia" was
published in 1990 (1). A young boy presented with a one month history of
daily fevers (>101 deg F) with no response to amoxicillin and clavulanic
acid. His friend was requested to present for evaluation. The case was
solved when serology for _F. tularensis_ for both boys came back positive.
The exposure: "At this point the boys admitted running over a rabbit with a
hand-pushed lawnmower, not initially realizing it was there until they saw
the fur flying. The mower was then rerouted and they then deliberately ran
over the rabbit a second time. The remains were examined without being
touched and then disposed."
Tularemia is a difficult diagnosis, especially when there is no index of
suspicion. Laboratory diagnosis may be delayed and can present dangers to
laboratory personnel, especially if the organism is successfully cultured
(2,3).
In addition to the drugs mentioned in your commentary, tetracyclines,
especially doxycycline are also very effective for treatment and are
recommended in mass casualty bioterrorism scenarios (4-6).
In one review of the literature in pre-antibiotic days, tularemic pneumonia
had a mortality rate of 40 percent. Pneumonia can occur in
both ulceroglandular and typhoidal tularemia. Several large outbreaks
of typhoidal tularemia with pneumonia have occurred in the USA, Finland,
and Sweden (8-10).
