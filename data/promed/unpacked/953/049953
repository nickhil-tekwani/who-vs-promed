The number of lives lost to the recent cholera outbreak in Bauchi State has risen to 37. The immediate-past Commissioner for Health in the state, Dr. Aliyu Maigoro, had on [Tue 25 May 2021], announced the outbreak in the state, with a 37-year-old housewife who reportedly had the disease at the Burra General Hospital on [Sat 24 Apr 2021]. Maigoro disclosed then that 20 people had died from the disease, while 322 people affected were being managed.

Meanwhile, the Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (BSPHDA) has said the deadly disease has now spread to 6 more local government areas from the initial 9, making it 15 local government areas of the state. In a data made available to journalists in Bauchi by the Executive Chairman of the agency, Dr. Rilwanu Mohammed, yesterday [Mon 14 Jun 2021], BSPHDA disclosed that 1799 cholera cases were recorded since [Tue 25 May 2021], when the outbreak was announced.

In a telephone interview with journalists, the Executive Chairman of the agency, Mohammed, said the state government in collaboration with some international donor agencies has embarked on the construction of a 100-bed capacity Cholera Treatment Centre (CTC) at the state Specialist Hospital to take care of the victims. Mohammed also explained that the government has directed that the treatment of the victims should be given free of charge to decrease the economic hardship faced by the people, and added that all the required drugs for the treatment have been made available. He also appealed to the residents of the state to embrace cleanliness by maintaining a clean environment always.

[As seen in the "See Alsos," a number of states of Nigeria are experiencing outbreaks of _Vibrio cholerae_ infections.

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (2,3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice-powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in the WHO reference below (6). Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
