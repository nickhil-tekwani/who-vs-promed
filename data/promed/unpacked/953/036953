Japan scare over China dumplings
--------------------------------
Dozens of Japanese people say they have fallen ill after eating
Chinese-made dumplings, prompting Tokyo officials to launch an
inquiry.The frozen dumplings, known as gyoza in Japan, were made by
Tianyang Food in China's Hebei province. Japanese officials said they
contained traces of pesticide, probably added in production or
packaging in China.

China said no traces of pesticide had been found in pre-export
inspections, but ordered a halt to production. The issue has
triggered intensive media coverage in Japan and sparked public alarm.
Leaders held an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the problem.

Safety scares
-------------
The problems emerged on Wednesday [30 Jan 2008], when 10 people were
reported to have fallen ill from the dumplings -- thin dough packets
containing ground meat and vegetables which are then fried. A
5-year-old girl was in a serious condition in hospital, reports said.

By late Thursday [31 Jan 2008] there were unconfirmed reports of
dozens of cases. The Japanese distributor, JT Foods, has recalled the
dumplings and
other products made by the same company.

Japan's top government spokesman, Nobutaka Machimura, urged Chinese
authorities to investigate. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu
Jianchiao said preliminary tests on 2 batches of the dumplings had
found them to be safe. "It is not logical to make representations
before the results of the
investigation are released," he said.

In recent months, Chinese-made products have been involved in several
safety scares. But Japan has also had its problems. Last year [2007],
confectioners admitted to mislabelling expiry dates on biscuits and
rice cakes.

[It would be helpful to know the clinical signs and symptoms of those
that reported an illness. It would also be helpful to know what
pesticide was found and the level that was present in the dumplings.
Unfortunately the article does not provide enough information
regarding this intoxication. - Mod.TG]
