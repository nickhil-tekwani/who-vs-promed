A secondary school in the Highlands has seen almost half its pupils struck
down by an unidentified illness. Yesterday, 420 of the 992 pupils at Thurso
High School were absent with flu-like symptoms. Another 155 youngsters from
the 850-pupil Wick High School and half the roll at the 43-pupil Watten
Primary have also been hit by the bug. Highland Council education officials
have called in health experts to investigate the outbreak, although no
school is being closed at this stage.
NHS (National Health Service) Highland is arranging to take swabs in the
hope of identifying [an infectious agent], which so far appears to be
confined to pupils. John Inkster, Thurso's rector, said: "I've not seen
anything like this in my 16 years at the school. It seems to be hitting
only the younger generation. There have been no teaching staff off. I don't
know what is causing it."
The outbreak became widespread on Mon 5 Dec 2005, when about 380 pupils
were off sick at Thurso High. A council spokesman said: "Due to the
exceptionally high level of absence, we alerted public health experts to
see if there is any action we should be taking to ensure the well-being of
the pupils. At the moment there are no plans to close schools, but we will
monitor the situation."
Pupils have been complaining of symptoms similar to flu, with high
temperatures, headaches, coughing and sore throats. Dr Eric Baijal, NHS
Highland's director of public health medicine, said: "Flu-like viruses are
[associated with] self-limiting infections. Investigations are being made
to identify the cause of the illness."

[ProMED-mail acknowledges receipt of similar information from Dr. Alfonso
J. Rodriguez. Further information is awaited concerning the etiology of
this outbreak. Human influenza virus (A or B; so far C has not been
detected in Europe this year) is the most likely candidate. Influenza
vaccination for adults has been promoted aggressively by the NHS
(Scotland), which may explain the restriction of the outbreak to school pupils.
According to the website of the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme
(EISS), clinical influenza activity in Europe remains at baseline levels.
Sporadic laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza were detected in Latvia,
Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Spain in week 47/2005. For the geographical
spread of influenza, France and Latvia reported sporadic influenza
activity, which means that isolated cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza
infection have been detected. All other countries reported no influenza
activity, meaning that the overall level of clinical activity remained at
baseline levels and influenza virus infections are not being laboratory
confirmed.

It remains to be seen whether this outbreak in the Highland Region will
herald the beginning of the 2005/2006 influenza season in the UK. - Mod.CP]
