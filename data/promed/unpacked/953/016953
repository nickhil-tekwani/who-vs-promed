_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ infection responds to antibiotic therapy. It
would be interesting to know whether any treatment was initiated and if
not, why not? Were the birds euthanized because they were so sick or
because no one knew anything else to do?

Azithromycin has been used for _Mycoplasma_ infections in cats and dogs (2
doses separated by 2 days will last for 14-21 days in a cat; the half-life
in dogs is shorter at 48 hours). There are doses for reptiles, and I have
heard it has been used for _Mycoplasma_ infections in endangered Desert
Tortoises, but I am unable to find a dose for them at this time.
In cats it is dosed at 5 mg/kg. There is probably a dose that can be
safely used in birds. I will leave that dose to the avian
specialists. It is reported to have an affinity for respiratory tissues
and is supposed to be effective against _Mycoplasma_, _Chlamydia_, and
_Bordatella_.
