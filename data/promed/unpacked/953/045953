VWA: no bluetongue yet in the Netherlands
-----------------------------------------
According to the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority
(VWA), no new outbreaks have, so far, been recorded in the
Netherlands.

"Since April [2008] we have had more than 200 clinically suspected
cases, but not in even a single one has the virus been demonstrated,"
said the VWA spokesman.

New infections have already been recorded in neighboring Belgium and
Germany. The VWA is expecting such infections to occur during the
current year [2008], "but this will clearly be to a lesser extent,
thanks to the vaccination as well as to the fact that many animals
have already gone through infection last year [2007, and have,
subsequently, become immune. - Mod.AS]

Arjan den Hartog of the Royal Dutch Society of Veterinary Medicine
(KNMvD) says that the absence of new infections in the Netherlands is
rather remarkable. "The reason for that is not clear. The rate of
vaccination may have played its role to some extent, but this cannot
yet be said with certainty, since the infection pressure is not yet
very high."

The KNMvD notes that the absence of infection is not related to the
midges. "The midges are already fully active," says Den Hartog. It is
also not related to the rate of farmers' alertness. "Due to
vaccination, the alertness of farmers has rather increased, since
they carefully watch their animals to detect any post-vaccination
side effects."

Re-emergence of bluetongue in ruminants in Belgium
--------------------------------------------------
Not quite unexpectedly, the bluetongue type 8 -- just like in the
summers of 2006 and 2007 -- is back up in the country, specifically
in Komen [Comines] in the province of Hainaut.

Bluetongue occurs only among ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats...). The
disease is not contagious to humans or to other species. No risk for
consumers is related to animal products.

The disease spread widely last year [2007] in our livestock. The
disease caused high mortality and production losses in sheep and
cattle, with significant economical losses in the livestock sector.

Although the re-emergence of the virus requires no new measures, the
Food Safety Agency wishes to draw attention to the bluetongue
vaccination campaign launched in May [2008]. Vaccination is the only
efficient way to protect sheep and cattle against bluetongue.

The vaccination campaign in 2008 covers the compulsory vaccination of
all sheep and cattle, including bison and buffalo, but excluding veal
calves. This means that all animals born before 1 Sep 2008 must be
vaccinated before 31 Dec 2008.

It is important to note that an animal is optimally protected only if
vaccination was applied correctly and completely according to the
guidelines. For sheep, a single injection will suffice. Cows should
be vaccinated twice, with an interim of 3 to 4 weeks.

The recorded case involved a bovine, which has undergone only a
single vaccination; it got infected shortly before or after the
vaccination.

Animals should be vaccinated the earliest possible, preferably prior
to the summer months, so that they may have time enough to build up
their immunity.

As of 29 Jul 2009, 1 332 693 vaccinations have been registered.

[With Germany announcing its 1st BTV-8 infection for 2008 on 21 Jul
(an unvaccinated sheep in Baden-Wurttenberg; see ProMED-mail
20080722.2216) and Belgium's 1st infected infection on 29 July (a
single-vaccinated cow), it seems that the 2008 bluetongue serotype 8
season in western Europe can eventually be declared open.

France is also experiencing new infections, though the French
information remains somewhat confusing. According to the French
Ministry of Agriculture's data of 18 Jul 2008 (see ProMED-mail
20080719.2195), as of that date, 6274 cases (which means "outbreaks")
of BTV-8 were listed in France for 2008, of which 260 were ascribed
to viral circulation during 2008. An update from the same source,
dated 29 Jul 2008, says that the number of outbreaks ascribed to
BTV-8 virus circulation during 2008 has risen to 1868. It also says
that 6020 bluetongue cases have been recorded in France during the
1st half of 2008 (somewhat in conflict with the 6274 figure of 18 Jul
2008), of which 6 cases were of the BTV-1 serotype, all related to
viral circulation during 2007... For the update of 29 Jul 2008, see
<http://agriculture.gouv.fr/sections/thematiques/sante-protection-animaux/maladies-animales/fievre-catarrhale-ovine/fichier-telecharger-6/downloadFile/FichierAttache_5_f0/pds_290708.pdf>.
This PDF report includes a list of the outbreak locations and a map,
updated 30 Jul 2008, showing the new outbreaks.

On the other hand, according to a report from the Bluetongue French
National Reference Laboratory (AFSSA-Alfort), dated 3 Jul 2008, as of
that date, only 4 isolates of BTV-8 had been performed from samples
derived during 2008 (one in March, 3 in June). See ProMED-mail
posting 20080703.2027, item [2]. An update from the reference
laboratory may help clarify the current situation. - Mod.AS]
