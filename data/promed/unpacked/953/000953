Dr Beale is the Chief Consultant of Infectious Disease Unit at Tygerberg
Hospital
<mwb2@gerga.sun.ac.za> and answered my question about "the topic" as follows:
"[This was not food poisoning in the traditional sense. "Salt" was bought
off the street by the residents in Delft and it appears to have been sodium
nitrate and this induced severe methaemoglobinaemia with some fatalities.
Therefore not an infectious cause but rather a tragic case of poisoning
with a food additive. There have been
subsequent deaths reported (? 2 children, a baby and an adult) and some of
our own firms admissions had methaemoglobin levels in excess of 85%."

I can now complete the story. Apparently a man found a packet of "powder",
picked it up, thought it was salt, and gave it to a whole lot of people who
cooked with it. The patients then presented with methaemoglobinaemia and a
few died. It took some time to get hold of methylene blue because there
wasn't any in the hospital. The remainder were given the methylene blue and
all recovered. No bugs involved!
