Based on the notifiable disease surveillance system in Taiwan, during
the 35th epidemiological week (27 Aug to 2 Sep [2006]), 7 Japanese
encephalitis (JE) cases were reported in Taiwan. As of 2 Sep, there
had been 188 reported cases of JE nation-wide this year, of those, 20
had been confirmed. So far this year (2006), 2 JE deaths have been
reported.
The cumulative number of JE confirmed cases has decreased by 39 per
cent compared with the same period last year (2005, 33 cases). Among
this year's cases, one was classified as an imported case and 19 were
domestic cases. The origin of the imported case was Vietnam.

[Taiwan is within the broad geographical endemic JE belt that extends
from South Asia through Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the northern
tip of Australia. JE is the main cause of viral encephalitis in
Asia, with 30 000 - 50 000 cases reported annually. The virus is a
member of the flavivirus family and is closely related to St. Louis
encephalitis and West Nile virus.
Although most JE virus infections are inapparent, they can progress
to encephalitis and death, with neurological sequelae in some of
those who survive. The virus is maintained in birds and transmitted
by _Culex_ mosquitoes. Swine may serve as amplifying hosts.
There are 2 JE virus vaccines available, an attenuated product (SA
14-14-2) manufactured in China and an inactivated one (Biken) from
Japan. A JE fact sheet published by the US CDC can be found at
