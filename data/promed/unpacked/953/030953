Anthrax has been found in a Ukrainian meat-packing plant
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Emergency Situations of Ukraine reports that anthrax
[sic] has been found in a meat-packing plant in the Ivano-Frankovsk
region of Ukraine. According to the information given, on [7 Mar
2007], the Ivano-Frankovsk Regional State Laboratory of Veterinary
Medicine identified the anthrax organism during the investigation of
a cow's carcass. On [6 Mar 2007] a local inhabitant from the village
of Starunja in the Bogorodchanskiy district [located in the
Ivano-Frankovsk Region - Mod.NP] had sold this carcass to the
slaughter floor of the enterprise [known as] " Ol'va ", Seven
persons had had contact with the infected carcass. They are presently
under medical supervision and are also receiving preventive
treatment. The Ministry of Emergency Situations of Ukraine reports
that experts of the Regional Epidemiological Sanitary Station and the
Public Service of Veterinary Medicine are carrying out anti-epidemic
and anti-epizootic measures in the [geographical area where the
infected cow came from].

[In territory of Ukraine, as well as Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan,
Armenia, etc. republics of the former Soviet Union, cases of anthrax
in agricultural animals are registered practically annually. It is
connected to anthrax spores washing away on pastures, from numerous,
old dilapidated and neglected cattle burial grounds. For centuries,
animals that died from anthrax were placed in these burial grounds
without preliminarily burning the carcasses prior to burial. It was
only in the 2nd half of the last century when they began to burn
carcasses of animals that died from anthrax.
The Ivano-Frankovsk region (Pre-Carpathian region) is located in the
foothills of the Ukrainian Carpathians, in the western part of
Ukraine. The Ivano-Frankivsk region borders upon the Lviv, Ternopil,
Chernivtsi and Transcarpathian regions and Romania. The region's area
is 13.9 ths. sq. kms.. As of 1 Jun 2005 the region had 1 391
036 inhabitants, including 590 688 people living in towns and 800
348 habitants in rural areas. - Mod. NP]
[It is hard to work out what is meant by "carrying out anti-epidemic
and anti-epizootic measures in the focus of infection" and whether
this is occurring just on the slaughter floor at the " Ol'va
" plant and/or if they are tracing back and investigating the
situation in the village of Starunja. From the wording in the
article, it would seem that this worthy villager may have delivered a
dead cow (carcass) to the plant which was only questioned when they
started to butcher it. If true, that raises a number of questions. If
he brought in a sick cow, one must question why the plant veterinary
inspectors let it be slaughtered. Either way, a mess. Still this is a
change from the usual pattern of contaminated meat being sold in
street markets, exposing dozens of people, and then discovering it
long after the event. In some respects this may be an improvement.
Also, this is very early in the year for anthrax cases which are
usually seen in the hot summer months. Winter cases are usually a
result of contaminated hay or feed.- Mod MHJ]
