First report of frog Skin disease in cassava (_Manihot esculenta_) in
Venezuela. EI Chaparro-Martinez, G Trujillo-Pinto, Facultad de Agronomia,
Universidad Central de Venezuela, Ar. 2101, Apdo. 4579, Maracay, Venezuela.
Plant Dis 2001; 85: 1285. Published online as D-2001-1016-02N, 2001.
Accepted for publication 24 Sep 2001.
Frogskin disease (FSD) is a disease of clonally propagated cassava
(_Manihot esculenta_ Crantz) and has been reported to reduce cassava yields
significantly in South America (1). [It ... is caused by an
uncharacterized virus that is restricted to South America.
The evidence indicates that FSD is transmitted by stem cuttings and
graft[s (3), but little information is available on its distribution and
incidence in Venezuela. [87 tissue samples (state of origin and their
number) from plants expressing virus-like symptoms were collected from the
states of Amazonas (1), Aragua (7), Barinas (35), Cojedes (8), Monagas
(19), and Portuguesa (17). ...
The average daytime temperature was 26 degrees C, but ... was higher (above
28 degrees C) during the dry season. Samples were collected during the
[cooler rainy season because [such ... conditions tended to favor symptom
development (2). Roots of sampled cassava plants were examined for the
presence of FSD. A single ... stem cutting [70-80 cm long was taken from
each plant and subdivided into [4 pieces. [2 pieces were used as
rootstocks in graft inoculation tests with Secundina scions for FSD
detection, and [2 pieces were potted in sterilized soil to be used in
other tests. All potted and grafted plants were kept in the Vegetable
Virology Laboratory of the Faculty of Agronomy (Universidad Central de
Venezuela), at an average temperature of 24 degrees C and 80 per cent
relative humidity.
FSD infected plants were identified by mosaic signs on Secundina scions and
the presence of 80 nm spherical viral particles. Most FSD infected
cultivars expressed only root signs. In the case of Secundina cvs. MCOL 22
and MCOL 113, however, foliar symptoms were also detected (1). FSD was
found in a simple infection in [1 cassava sample from Aragua State (14.3
per cent incidence, 1 of 7 samples) and in [4 cassava samples from Barinas
State (11.4 per cent incidence, 4 of 35 samples) [co-infected with
[Cassava X potexvirus (detected by ... DAS-ELISA).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of FSD ... in Venezuela.

[According to reference No. 3, FSD is present in the Andean regions of
central and southern Colombia and is endemic in the Amazon regions of the
country. Because of the rapid spread of FSD, the whitefly _Bemisia
tuberculata_ is suspected as a vector. - Mod.DH
