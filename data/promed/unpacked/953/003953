MYCOBACTERIUM SIMIAE, HUMAN: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

From: Carol Pennel <pennel@swbell.net>

Does anyone have any reference for the contraction of _Mycobacterium
simiae_ by a human with no history of contact with primates? Can it be
caused by use of organic fertilizers? Any information will be appreciated.
My next door neighbor has been diagnosed with this bacterium and is
wondering how she contracted it.

[According to my Hansen's Disease colleagues, _M. simiae_ is an opportunist
infection of unknown origin which occasionally causes medical problems.
They have used it for laboratory drug trials. Have any of our members more
insight on this? - Mod.MHJ]
