The chief sanitary epidemiology doctor of Kaliningrad, E. Babura, reported that tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease were still highly prevalent in 2014.

There were 11 cases of tick-borne encephalitis registered in 2014; the incidence rate was 1.15 per 100 000 population. The disease has been registered in 6 regions of Kaliningrad (2 in the city, 1 in Svetlovsky and 5 in Nesterov districts, 1 in Nemansk, 1 in Slavsk, and 1 in Gusev districts).

The incidence of Lyme disease is also high with 137 cases; the incidence rate was 14.35 per 100 000 population, which is higher than the national Russian average.

In 2014, 2520 people reported tick bites in Kaliningrad (in 2013 - 2523), and in 26 percent of cases these are children under 14 years of age (665 cases).

Tick encephalitis antigen was discovered in 1.5 percent of ticks removed from affected people (in 2013. - 1.1 percent), and antigen to borreliosis was found in 13 percent (in 2013 - 18 percent).

[The Kaliningrad Department of Sanitary Surveillance stated that the level of acaricidal treatment is still low in some of the districts. In addition, the population is inadequately covered by vaccination. Every year only 5000 people are vaccinated or revaccinated, which does not guarantee protection at the population level. All these deficits cause high incidence of tick-borne infections. - ProMED Corr.BA

The following information was extracted from: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-
related-to-travel/tickborne-encephalitis.

"Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by the TBE virus, an RNA virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus and is closely related to Powassan virus. TBEV has 3 subtypes: European, Siberian, and Far Eastern. TBEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick of the _Ixodes_ species, primarily _I. ricinus_ (in Europe) or _I. persulcatus_ (in Siberia and Far Eastern Russia). Ticks are both vector and virus reservoir, and small rodents are the primary amplifying host. TBE can also be acquired by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products (e.g., milk and cheese) from infected goats, sheep, or cows. TBEV transmission has been infrequently reported during laboratory exposure and slaughtering viremic animals, and direct person-to-person transmission, through blood transfusion and breastfeeding.

Russia, especially western Siberia, has the largest number of reported TBE cases. Other European countries with known endemic areas include Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Switzerland. Asian countries with reported TBE cases or virus activity include China, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and South Korea.

The risk of acquiring TBE in forested areas through activities such as camping, hiking, fishing, bicycling, or military training peaks in early and late summer when ticks are active. The incidence and severity of disease are highest in people aged at least 50 years. The risk is negligible for people who remain in urban or unforested areas and who do not consume unpasteurized dairy products.

No TBE vaccines are licensed or available in the United States, though 2 inactivated cell culture-derived TBE vaccines are available in Europe, in adult and pediatric formulations: FSME-IMMUN (Baxter, Austria) and Encepur (Novartis, Germany). The adult formulation of FSME-IMMUN is also licensed in Canada. In Russia 2 other inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). At least 1 other TBE vaccine is produced in China, but information regarding this vaccine is not available in the English literature. The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged at least 50 years.

The routine primary TBE vaccination series is given after 6 months of age; the first booster dose should be given 3 years after the primary series and subsequent booster doses vary by age: every 5 years for people aged less than 50 years and every 3 years for those aged at least 50 years. An accelerated vaccination schedule has been evaluated for both European TBE vaccines, and results in seroconversion rates are similar to those observed with the standard vaccination schedule. Travelers anticipating high-risk exposures, such as working or camping in forested areas or farmland, adventure travel, or living in TBE-endemic countries for an extended period of time, may wish to be vaccinated in Canada or Europe."

In the news report above, the incidence of Lyme disease in the region is greater than that of TBE, possibly on account of the availability of an effective vaccine for TBE. There is no Lyme disease vaccine for humans currently available in the US or Russia. SmithKline Beecham (now GlaxoSmithKline) withdrew the 1st and only FDA-licensed vaccine against Lyme disease in 2002 (http://www.historyofvaccines.org/content/articles/history-lyme-disease-vaccine). The best way to avoid getting Lyme disease is to prevent tick bites; (see http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/on_people.html).
