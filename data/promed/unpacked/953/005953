Blast disease threatens crop
----------------------------
Farmers blame fog for triggering the blast disease in Tiruchi district. They have complained that it has caused serious loss to the standing "BPT 5204" variety. They said farmers relied more on BPT 5204 variety as it ensured immediate marketability with good price. But the blast disease has destroyed the crop.

S.K. Selvaraj of the Tamil Maanila Congress, said the sudden fall in temperature had triggered blast disease because of fog. The tillers had grown [but] without grains inside. Farmers want a compensation.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Pyricularia oryzae_ (synonym _Magnaporthe oryzae_, previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). Rice blast is one of the most destructive diseases of the crop worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 per cent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. Depending on which plant parts are affected, the disease may manifest itself as leaf, collar, node or neck blast. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity (as stated above). The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

An outbreak of rice blast was also reported from the same area in early 2015 (ProMED-mail post 20150128.3124545), but it is unclear if the same rice variety was planted then. The popular BPT 5204 (released in the 1980s) is known to be highly susceptible to a number of diseases. Alternative varieties have been developed and are recommended by authorities (see links below).
