Tomato spotted wilt virus threatens pepper recovery
---------------------------------------------------
The continued appearance of plants affected by tomato spotted wilt virus
(TSWV) in pepper [capsicum] crops since mid-December [2007] is making life
very difficult for pepper growers in Almeria. Despite the overall success
of the Almerian pepper campaign, as reported by the sector in early
December [2007], there has been evidence this January [2008] of some
significant losses, mainly in the latest crops transplanted at the end of
July and August. With respect to the latest plantings in August, barely
10-15 per cent of the anticipated production volume has been harvested to
date. Nor is the current price situation in mid-January offering growers
much encouragement to continue with this crop.
According to Mr Pedro Pleguezuelo, product manager at Syngenta in Spain,
the incidence of TSWV could also have an influence on how the pepper crop
area develops in the next campaign: "Pepper growers in Almeria are
considering the possibility of reducing the area assigned to this
vegetable, mainly due to the risk of a high incidence of TSWV."
There has been a redistribution of the pepper plantation area in Almeria in
the current campaign, with some farmers opting for other crops. This shows
that some pepper producers foresaw certain difficulties of adaptation in
the first campaign that employed integrated crop management. "However, it
is clear that everyone believes that integrated crop management is the best
and the safest technique for ensuring the highest fruit quality, and
improvements will be seen in forthcoming campaigns," Pleguezuelo told
Peppers Today.
The key vegetables which have gained hectares at the expense of peppers
have been courgettes [zucchini], with a 15 per cent larger plantation area,
cucumbers (> 8-9 per cent) and tomatoes (> 3-4 per cent). Areas growing
aubergines and other types of cucumber have also shown an increase.

[Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV; type species of genus _Tospovirus_) has
one of the broadest host ranges among plant viruses and is one of few
affecting both dicot and monocot hosts. It is regarded as one of the most
economically destructive plant pathogens and has had a serious impact on
many crop species worldwide causing up to 100 per cent yield loss in some
instances. Diseases attributed to TSWV were 1st reported in Australia about
1915. TSWV (and some other tospoviruses) constitute a severe threat to the
cultivation of solanaceous, leguminous and cucurbit vegetables worldwide.
On capsicum and tomato, it affects both shoots and fruit causing leaf
distortion, spotting, wilting and necrotic streaks as well as distortion,
discolouration and ring patterns on fruit. Early symptoms are often
difficult to diagnose.
TSWV is transmitted by various species of thrips, including the western
flower thrips (_Frankliniella occidentalis_), the onion thrips (_Thrips
tabaci_), and the chilli thrips (_Scirtothrips dorsalis_). Thrips are plant
pests in their own right causing considerable leaf damage. The virus needs
to be acquired during the nymph stage by feeding on infected plants, and
insects retain the ability to transmit it for the remainder of their lives.
TSWV multiplies in the vector but cannot be passed on from infected females
through the eggs. It is not seed transmitted but transmission by mechanical
means and grafting has been reported. Weed species can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Disease management includes vector control, use of clean
planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, and
phytosanitary measures.
TSWV has been included on the quarantine list of the European Plant
Protection Organisation (EPPO). So far the only efficient method to control
TSWV in pepper and tomato crops in the Mediterranean region has relied on
host resistance genes. However, resistance breaking strains of TSWV on
capsicum and tomato cultivars have been reported in recent years both under
experimental conditions and in the field. All the alternative crops
suggested in the above report are also hosts of TSWV and its thrips
vectors, and crossing over of TSWV between these hosts can occur. A mere
change of host crop species is therefore not likely to eliminate the virus
problem in the region.
