A total of 407 Cambodian people died out of some [40 000] dengue
fever cases in 2007, which scored a 10 percent death rate, health
official Ngan Chantha said here on Friday [4 Jan 2008].
Kampong Cham province was the main place of dengue deaths because its
density of population was higher than other provinces, said the
official from the Health Ministry.
"The residents didn't clean the places around their houses and their
water tanks in a proper way, which caused tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes
albopictus_, although _Aedes aegypti_ doubtless is abundant there as
well. - Mod.TY] to transmit virus to people easily," he said. People
should pay more attention to their health care and sanitation, he said.
In 2007, the government spent about USD 3 million to contain the
epidemic, he said.
In addition, the World Health Organization, the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank and other non-governmental organizations contributed
money to carry out the campaign, he added.

[In the last PRO/MBDS posting on dengue in Cambodia, there were
reports of more than 38 000 cases and 389 deaths (see Dengue -
Cambodia (06) 20071019.3413). The above newswires increase the total
burden caused by dengue virus in Cambodia during 2007 to almost 40
000 cases and 407 deaths.
According to background data available on the World Health
Organization (WHO), Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) website,
the outbreak in 2007 was the largest ever documented outbreak of
dengue in Cambodia. The prior major epidemic year was 1998, when
there were approximately 16 000 reported cases (see
<http://www.wpro.who.int/sites/mvp/epidemiology/dengue/cam_profile.htm>
or the WHO Global Health Atlas, DengueNet database
(<http://www.who.int/globalatlas/dataQuery/default.asp>),
where 16 216 cases are reported). While it is highly likely that the
increased number of reported cases is somewhat influenced by marked
improvements in disease surveillance activities in the country, an
almost 3-fold rise in reported cases is highly significant. In
addition, the 10 percent case fatality rate (CFR) reported in 2007
was the highest CFR reported since 1991, when the reported CFR was 9 percent.
According to the WHO Global Health Atlas, DengueNet database
<http://www.who.int/globalatlas/dataQuery/default.asp>,
all 4 dengue serotypes were isolated during 2007, with dengue virus
type 3 (DEN-3) being the most prevalent, followed by dengue type 2
(DEN-2), followed by types 1 (DEN-1) and 4 (DEN-4).

The municipal government of Bacoor, Cavite has declared a dengue
outbreak because of the growing number of people afflicted with the
disease, ABS-CBN News reported Tuesday [6 Jan 2008]. Based on
records, a total of 53 residents were admitted to hospitals due to
dengue from August last year [2007] up to this month [January 2008].
Of these patients, 5 died because of the disease.

At least 50 confirmed cases of dengue fever and about 500 suspects
were detected in central Bolivia after recent rains, flooding and
river flooding occurred in the area.
The person responsible for monitoring diseases at the Bolivian
Ministry of Health, Juan Carlos Arraya, told EFE that almost all the
patients are in the tropical region of Chapare, in the central
department of Cochabamba.
Arraya explained that for the moment, there is no person suffering
from dengue hemorrhagic fever, the most serious type of the disease.
Of the 9 departments of Bolivia [equivalent to states or provinces],
6 (Cochabamba, Beni, Santa Cruz, Potosi, Chuquisaca and La Paz) have
been affected by floods, rains and flooding in recent weeks -- in
many cases caused by the climatic phenomenon "La Nina" -- which
caused at least 8 deaths and 2 missing persons.
In 2007, there was one fatality from dengue hemorrhagic fever and
1930 affected by the classical variant of the disease.

In Para, 3 people died with symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever
(DHF) within the past 8 days. One of these ill individuals was from
Belem and the other 2 from Redencao (southern part of the state). In
the region, another 5 persons died with similar symptoms since November [2007].
The situation indicates that there is an outbreak of dengue in the
region, according to Rodolfo Skrivan, Director of the regional public
hospital of Araguaia, located in Redencao. The hospital receives
patients from the other 14 nearby municipalities.
"Dengue is seasonal. In some seasons of the year, there is greater
[dengue] incidence. The peak of illnesses was anticipated in February
or March, the rainy season. This worried us because, since we had
anticipated it, it might have been worse," the director stated.
The agency affirmed that it would send a team to Redencao to analyze
the situation. But, according to the adjunct secretary [of health]
with portfolio, Walter Amoras, the quantity of cases can not be
classified as an outbreak since the cases are scattered over 15
cities in the southern part of the state. "This indicates that the
municipalities are not taking a lesson from the situation. They are
not educating the public correctly."

this Wednesday [9 Jan 2007], 82 cases of dengue have been registered
in Rio de Janeiro. The number of dengue cases is being brought up to
date. This Wednesday [9 Jan 2007] the Municipal Secretary of Health
indicated that in 2007, 23 585 dengue cases were confirmed.
In the 1st 9 days of 2008, 82 people had dengue disease. As of
Tuesday [1 Jan 2008], only 14 of them had been [laboratory?] confirmed.

Ceara had 9.8 percent of the nation's dengue cases, with notification
of 24 793 cases of classical dengue.
72 new cases of dengue were registered in the state of Ceara, with 3
DHF cases and 69 classical dengue fever cases during the 1st week of
2008, according to the Weekly Epidemiology Dengue Bulletin released
yesterday [4 Jan 2007] by the Secretariat of Health of the state (SESA).
The number of deaths did not change, remaining at 10 confirmed cases.
In Ceara state, DHF has now reached 295 confirmed cases versus 292
the week before. In total, 651 cases were notified, of which 318 were
discarded [negative for dengue], and 38 were still being
investigated, according to SESA.
In Fortaleza, 118 DHF cases were confirmed, with one death. "We are
investigating 16 suspected deaths, which have still not been
confirmed," stated Dr. Manoel Fonseca, Coordinator of Health
Promotion and Protection of SESA.
Sobral municipality is in 2nd place, with 47 confirmed cases of DHF
and 3 deaths, and Caucaia is in 3rd place, with 20 [DHF] cases and one death.
The 1st bulletin of 2008 confirmed a total of 24 793 cases in 167
municipalities in Ceara. In the last week of last year [2007], there
were 24 724 confirmed cases of classical dengue. Fortaleza led [in
numbers of cases] in the dengue epidemic, with 11 687 cases of
confirmed classical dengue, "50 percent of all the cases," stated
Fonseca. In 2nd place was Sobral, with 1753 cases.
Despite Ceara being the state with the highest incidence of DHF in
the northeast, Manoel Fonseca clarified that there was a reduction in
the [case] fatality rate, which was over 8.7 percent in 2006, going
[down] to 3.3 percent last year [2007].
The doctor admitted, however, that in the last 3 years, the number of
dengue cases has remained high. "This year [2008], the cases will
still be high, now that we have 3 types of the virus: dengue 1, 2 and
3. In the interior, the outbreak of [dengue virus] 3 still may occur," he said.

The arrival of summer promises to bring big problems to the Brazilian
population in the next months. According to the data from the
Ministry of Health, there is a trend that will reach a record
[number] of dengue [cases].
Between January and September of the past year [2007], the number of
recorded [dengue] cases in the country was 50 percent above that of
2006. Just during this period, there were more than 480 000 [dengue
cases] registered, with 121 deaths. Given the control measures
carried out by the government, it is very likely that this year's
[2008] summer will surpass the outbreak of 2002, when 800 000
[dengue] cases were registered. This [projection is made] because
during this past winter, a period of little rain and [usually] fewer
cases, the [case] numbers did not fall.
Sao Paulo state is another area that worries the specialists.
Research carried out during the same period points out that the
region registered more than 64 000 [dengue] cases. Of the 645 Sao
Paulo [state] cities, 127 had indices of at least 300 cases
registered per 100 000 inhabitants. Small and medium-sized cities,
such as Sao Jose do Rio Preto and Bauru e Ribeirao Preto, have
suffered epidemics of this disease.

[It is difficult to make predictions with even a modicum of
precision. Estimating that dengue virus transmission will continue in
2008 is to state the obvious. Apparently, Brazil has gotten to the
same dengue outbreak situation as Central America and Southeast Asia,
with intense dengue virus transmission year after year. - Mod.LJS]

The Director of Epidemiological Services of the Health Corporation in
the state of Aragua, Luis Dorta, announced that the central area was
closed in 2007 "as an alert zone" due to the proliferation of dengue
virus [transmission] and said that a continuation of the increase in
the number of cases could result in an epidemic this year [2008].
He pointed out, however, that the meteorological conditions during
the next months are favorable for combating the virus, [the mosquito
vectors of which] reproduce in containers of clean water. "We hope
that as we enter summer, the season in which there is no rain, we can
combat the problem."
Dorta stated that during the past year [2007], 3518 cases of dengue
fever were registered, of which 156 were DHF. With respect to these
cases, he pointed out that for every 21 dengue cases, one was DHF. He
stated that in the last 5 months of the year [2007], 8 deaths caused
by this disease were registered, of which 6 were children under 10 years old.

In 2007, 15 people died and more than 29 112 were affected [infected]
by dengue in Honduras, authorities reported on Sunday [4 Jan 2008].
In 2006, the number of fatal victims of this disease was 9, and there
were 7800 affected [by it].
In 2007, 4156 DHF cases were registered nationally.
"We cannot hide the significant increase in dengue [cases] in the
country in the past year [2007]," the Minister of Health, Jenny Meza,
told the press.
This situation [the increase in dengue cases] occurred despite the
army units, public employees and students having circulated in the
neighborhoods of the main cities of the country to help remove scrap
metal, fumigate houses and destroy _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus
mosquito vector breeding sites.
The government constantly asks the population to eliminate standing
water in their homes, specifically in bowls, bottles, tires and
flower vases, where this insect breeds.
Official statistics indicate that in 6 years, more than 60 000 dengue
cases have been registered in Honduras.

[It would be interesting to know how successful the campaign has been
in eliminating or reducing _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites and whether
lessons were learned that would improve vector control efforts in the
coming year. Given the increase in numbers of dengue cases in 2007,
these efforts were not as successful as the Honduras health
authorities had hoped.
