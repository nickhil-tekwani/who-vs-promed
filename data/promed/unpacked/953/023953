A rise in cases of malaria in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi continues to be a matter of concern for the state government. The 2 districts together have reported more than 9800 cases of malaria in 2014, which is [much] more than 50 per cent of the total cases of malaria in the state, which has recorded a total of 12 141 cases.

At an inter-departmental coordination meeting of Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts regarding malaria held at the office of the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner here on Thursday [22 Jan 2015], Joint Director (Malaria and Filaria) B.G. Prakash said as many as 8240 cases of malaria have been reported in Dakshina Kannada, while 1639 cases have been reported from Udupi.

Of the 8240 cases, 7313 cases of malaria are from Mangaluru City Corporation area. Another reason for the high number of cases is also because of a better reporting mechanism.

Dr. Prakash said that the area of concern in the 2 districts has been the increase in the number of cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ (PF) malaria, which has high incidence of morbidity. The number of PF malaria cases was 52 in January 2014, which then spiked to 140 in July 2014. The number of PF malaria cases came down to 30 in December 2014.

Of the 8240 cases, there were 7521 _Plamodium vivax_ malaria cases and 719 cases of PF malaria cases in 2014. There has been a 45 per cent increase in the number of _P. falciparum_ malaria cases in the Dakshina Kannada, which is a cause of concern.

[Malaria is endemic in large parts of India but with very different levels of transmission intensity. The southern part of Karnataka State is usually regarded as a low risk area, and, therefore, the reports of _P. falciparum_ here are of particular concern. - Mod.EP
