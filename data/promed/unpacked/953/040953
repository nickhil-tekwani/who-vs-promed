Seroevidence for High Prevalence of Subclinical Infection with Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus among Workers in a Live Poultry Market in Indonesia
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background. In Indonesia, highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus has become endemic in poultry, and has caused sporadic deadly infections in human. Since 2012 we have conducted fixed-point surveillance of avian influenza viruses at a live poultry market in East Java, Indonesia. In this study we examined the seroprevalence of the virus infection among market workers.

Methods. Sera were collected from 101 workers in early 2014 and examined for antibody activity against avian A(H5N1) Eurasian lineage virus by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay.

Results. By the HI assay, 84 percent of the sera tested positive for antibody activity against the avian virus. Further analysis revealed the average HI titer in 2014 to be 2.9-fold higher than in 2012 and that seroconversion occurred in 44 percent of paired sera (11/25) between 2012 and 2014. A medical history survey was carried out in 2016; responses to questionnaires indicated that none of workers had suffered from severe acute respiratory illness during 2013.

Conclusions. This study provides evidence of a high prevalence of avian A(H5N1) virus infection in 2013 among workers of a live poultry market. However no instances of hospitalizations were reported, we can therefore conclude the virus did not manifest any clinical symptoms in workers.

[The article titled 'Seroevidence for High Prevalence of Subclinical Infection with Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus among Workers in a Live Poultry Market in Indonesia' by Shimizu et al can be accessed at the above URL.

The 1st human cases in Indonesia occurred in July 2005. By then, Indonesia was the worst affected country, with more than 150 reported human cases to date and a case-fatality rate of around 83 percent [http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2010-41-5/09-4850.pdf].

A field study by van Beest Holle et al in 2007 did not find evidence of antibodies against avian influenza A(H5N1) among West Java poultry farmers, despite recent reports of H5N1 outbreaks among poultry in the area. This finding was consistent with other Asian studies that found limited seropositivity among poultry farmers exposed to H5N1-virus since 2004 [http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/seameo/2010-41-5/09-4850.pdf].

Studies by another group in Bangladesh [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0073200] also showed that despite exposure to sick poultry, no farm or market poultry workers were seropositive for HPAI H5N1 virus antibodies while Chi Dung et al have reported overall seroprevalence of 6.1 percent with the highest proportion (7.2 percent) in poultry market workers in Hanoi, and the majority of seropositive subjects (70.3 percent) were slaughterers or sellers of poultry [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4318972/].

Among serological assays, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay has been the main method used to investigate/document exposure related immune responses to influenza viruses. However, microneutralization tests (MNT) have been shown to be more sensitive and more specific for various influenza viruses [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21146560]. Furthermore, maximum sensitivity (80 percent) and specificity (96 percent) for the detection of anti-H5 antibody in adults aged 18 to 59 years have been shown by using the microneutralization assay combined with Western blotting [http://jcm.asm.org/content/37/4/937.full?view=long&pmid=10074505].

The results of the study described in this manuscript are based on data from paired sera taken 2 years apart and tested using HI test only and show definitive evidence of an immunological response in the farm workers. It would be interesting to compare the data if these samples are tested using MNT. - Mod.UBA
