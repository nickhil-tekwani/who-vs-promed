[1] Sierra Leone: official update
Date: 18 Jul 2014
Source: Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MOHS), Sierra Leone (Via e-mail from Metabiota) [edited]


As of today, 18 Jul 2014, we have 92 cumulative survivors, 397 confirmed Ebola virus disease [EVD] cases, and 127 EVD confirmed deaths. 65 patients are currently admitted at the EVD treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun.

The Ministry of Health & Sanitization and the World Health Organization have established a dedicated EVD Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at the WHO Country Office in Freetown. The EOC is co-Directed by the Minister of Health, Ms. Miata Kargbo and the WHO Representative for Sierra Leone, Dr. Jacob Mufunda and consists of leaders and partners involved in our fight against Ebola.

The EOC will serve as the Sierra Leone National Central Command and Control Center for Outbreak Response activities and will be directly linked with our district health leaders and with a regional EOC established by the World Health Organization in response to the current EVD epidemic http://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/news/2014/07/who-opens-regional-ebolaresponse-center.aspx, as well as EOCs currently operating at WHO AFRO and WHO Headquarters in Geneva.

The Center is currently focusing on the effective distribution of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare, recruiting new nurses to reinforce those on the frontlines, as well as coordinating additional resources needed to contain the epidemic. Consultants from the World Health Organization and the US Government are providing additional expertise to improve contact tracing and monitoring, which includes identifying individuals known to have had contact with infected persons. Contacts are monitored in order to ensure that if they do develop symptoms, they can be immediately cared for at the nearest treatment center. It is through careful monitoring of these contacts that we can identify the symptoms of the disease early and thereby improve each individual's chances of survival, as well as prevent the unintentional spread of the disease to the community by persons that don't know they are infected.

Regarding the establishment of the EOC, Minister of Health Kargbo states: "Our absolute priority is to ensure the safety of our citizens and to protect our brave health care providers serving on the frontline. Our new center of operations will serve as a War Room in our fight against Ebola and will equip us to rapidly deploy resources, manpower, and materials, a strategy that is going to put us ahead of the curve and end this epidemic."

NPR's Jason Beaubien is in Kailahun, Sierra Leone covering the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak that began in March [2014] in Guinea and has spread to neighboring countries. This morning [16 Jul 2014], he talked with us about a controversial burial, the impact of the "no touching" recommendation, and a sign of hope.

Q. Yesterday [15 Jul 2014], you were planning to go to the funeral for a 70-year-old woman who died of Ebola. How was it?

A. The funeral definitely captured the tension over EVD. The son of this woman had dug a grave right behind her house, in the backyard where she wanted to be buried. But other people filled the grave in before her body arrived because they didn't want her buried there. Eventually, the local chief came to settle everything, and the chief was quite upset. The son had to apologize to the chief for not having consulted him about burying his mother in the backyard. Then the chief allowed him to bury his mother in the village, but it had to be in the jungle behind the village. And so this guy and some relatives within an hour had cleared this area and dug a grave 6 feet deep. That's where they had the burial. The chief said this was the last time he was going to allow someone to bury an EVD victim in the village.

Q. The chief wants them to be buried [where]?

A. By the Ebola treatment center on the periphery of Kailahun, 3 or 4 miles from her village.

Q. Why are people afraid of burying an EVD victim in the village?

A. People just don't know how the EVD spreads. And they worry if a body's been buried and has EVD in it, the EVD will be able to get out and get them.

Q. EVD can't spread from a body that's been buried. How dangerous is the body before it's interred?

A. When a person dies, the virus has run rampant through that person. The level of virus is much lower in a person who's built up antibodies to fight it back. A dead body is incredibly hot from EVD and is likely to transmit the virus.

Q. So people are justified in being afraid of dead bodies. What happens when a body is found?

A. This morning, I heard there was a dead body, a man [found] just behind his house. People said he'd been sick for quite some time, like 3 years. So it's unclear whether he actually died from EVD or something else. But when someone is just found dead in the street, everybody thinks it's EVD, and you have to treat the body as if it's EVD.

Q. How was the body handled?

A. Everyone was terrified. Guys suited up in [protective] suits, 3 layers of gloves. WHO [World Health Organization] is trying to train local guys to do this. And this is part of the story at the moment. You've got EVD cases popping up all over, not just in Sierra Leone but in Liberia, in Guinea. Somebody has to go in and deal with the bodies. The problem throughout the region is that there isn't the medical staff trained in how to deal with an EVD case.

Q. Are there other misconceptions about Ebola?

A. Well, just a few minutes ago, I was talking to this one guy. He was saying that initially they believed that the white people who were showing up to treat EVD were cannibals, and they were trying to steal body parts. They were taking blood samples, taking swabs from dead bodies. And he said they believed I was a cannibal.

Q. And he meant you personally, that there were thoughts you were a cannibal?

A. He said it directly to me. But he said now he knows that that's not the case. He said the people are gaining confidence in the people who've come to try to treat people here.

Q. How is the threat of Ebola affecting daily life in the town?

A. This man was talking about precautions people are taking. He was saying that the "no touching" recommendation is being applied to sex. That no one in the village was having sex. I'm not sure that's necessarily true, but he said that was how the order on no touching was being interpreted.

Q. Who gave out the recommendation for no touching?

A. That is a message that has been given out in general. NGOs [non-governmental organizations] are putting out material about how Ebola spreads, what to do to keep yourself safe. No touching is one of the recommendations.

Q. Does the recommendation say: no touching strangers? No touching of family members?

A. Basically it's just said that you're not to touch other people, and everybody is interpreting that however they wish. So in church, they're no longer shaking hands. I'd assumed people in their families are still touching each other, but the "no sex thing" is how that guy's interpreting it.

Q. Life must be at a standstill in the town.

A. In many ways it's depressing. Schools are shut, the sole bank in town is shut, things are fairly bleak.

Q. What are people doing to pass the time?

A. One guy was telling me he's taking this time to go out to work on his garden, to get the weeds out. That's how he was dealing with it. A fair number of people are just standing around even though groups have been banned.

Q. Amid all the fear, is there any hope?

A. Last night [15 Jul 2014], 5 patients who were confirmed positive for EVD were released from the treatment center, the largest group ever to walk out of there. They were quite excited at Doctors Without Borders [MSF]. It shows that despite these incredibly high new numbers of cases and deaths, some people are recovering and are completely cured and being sent home.

[3] Sierra Leone: philanthropy
Date: 20 Jul 2014

http://www.sierraexpressmedia.com/archives/69242


On launching his anti-Ebola campaign in his home district of Koinadugu about a month ago, one of Sierra Leone's leading philanthropists, Momoh Konte, promised to donate 10 million leones [USD 2260] each month to keep up the campaign, and indeed, he has begun fulfilling his promise.

During his visit to Kabala over the weekend to get an update of the campaign, Momoh Konte gave Le 10 million [USD 2260], as well as 250 pairs of hand gloves and scores of thermometers to the Ebola Task Force which he set up in Koinadugu a month ago, and which has been working assiduously to make sure Ebola does not enter the Koinadugu district [see map at: http://lghttp.32183.nexcesscdn.net/80E716/magento/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/800x600/2a828c57b25d4fd80edb81e2ced1b53a/r/e/republic-sierra-leone-koinadugu-district-map-keynote-apple-iworks.jpg].

He presented the money and equipment to the task force during a brief meeting at the community centre in Kabala where executive members of the task force were in attendance and where they gave Momoh Konte an update on their activities over the past month.

The Ebola Task Force executive members explained they have succeeded in prevailing on the authorities to put a by-law in place that any stranger who visits Koinadugu must be taken to the district council for screening, adding that they now have an isolation unit where suspected EVD patients, if any, can be confined until they are screened.

The executive members continued that through their one month campaign, most residents of Koinadugu have abstained from eating bush meat as a preventive measure against EVD. They also informed Momoh Konte about a chlorinated water drum they have put at the check point leading to Koinadugu in which passengers are urged to wash their hands before entering the district.

The Ebola Task Force executive members lauded the traditional authorities for their cooperation. They also revealed that they have brought on board the anti-EVD campaign to certain work groups like pharmacists and prison officers who are also playing a vital role in the campaign.

Momoh Konte and his entourage were taken aback when they met a long queue at a check point while they were entering Fadugu, Koinadugu District. They found at the check point a big drum of chlorinated water in which passengers, including Momoh Konte and his entourage, washed their hands before entering into Fadugu while on their way to the district headquarters town, Kabala. It was then that Momoh Konte realized that his EVD campaign had taken effect!

[Sierra Leone is now detecting the largest number of EVD cases in the region.

Because of the multiplicity of reagents and tests being used by the many different laboratories now operating in the 3 countries (real time reverse transcriptase chain reaction (rtRTPCR), antigen capture, immunoglobulin test), a quality control system has been set up to test and compare the results between them and the Special Pathogens Branch of CDC Atlanta, USA on a standard panel of specimens. This is a much-needed initiative under the circumstances to clear up equivocal results and possible false positives or negatives. - Mod.JW
