AEDES AEGYPTI VS AE.ALBOPICTUS
==============================

In reference to recent messages from Paul Reiter and George O'Meara
regarding Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus in Sao Paulo State, Brazil:

Ae aegypti was reintroduced to Sao Paulo State from Minas Gerais State to
the northwest in 1985 and started spreading to the southeast. Ae albopictus
was introduced in 1986 from Rio de Janeiro State to the West and spread
east and northeast. Eventually, these two species met in the middle of the
state, after which Ae albopictus continued to spread to the west, but Ae
aegypti has spread very little. The vector control people think that the
retardation of further dispersal by Ae aegypti is due to low winter
temperatures in the south. I have seen no evidence that Ae aegypti
populations have decreased where Ae albopictus has entered. However, they
have found in Brazil that control measures are more effective against Ae
aegypti than Ae albopictus, probably because they are reaching a larger
portion of the Ae aegypti population in its domestic habitat.

Nor has there been a decrease of dengue transmission. In fact, there were
more dengue cases in the state of Sao Paulo in 1995 (>5000) than in any
previous year. All reported dengue outbreaks in Brasil have been in
municipalities with Ae aegypti and with or without Ae albopictus. In spite
of a report of an isolation of dengue-1 virus from Ae albopictus larvae from
Campos Altos, Minas Gerais State (Serufo et al. 1993. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo
Cruz. Rio de Janeiro), and finding of dengue antibodies in two localities in
that state where only Ae albopictus was found, it is obvious that Ae
albopictus is not an important vector of dengue in Brazil.

Regarding intentional introduction of Ae albopictus to areas where Ae aegypti
is a dengue vector, the obvious answer is that you may be trading one evil
for another. Ae albopictus transmits many arbovirus in the laboratory,
including yellow fever virus.

In Brazil, Ae aegypti bites mostly indoors and oviposits indoors and
outdoors, but usually near human habitation, thus it is highly "domestic".
Ae albopictus rarely enters houses, oviposits almost exclusively outdoors
and frequently oviposits great distances from human habitation. Both species
oviposit in both artificial and natural containers.

When we lived in Thailand and Indonesia (early 70's) Ae albopictus was a
very pesty biter in parks, more of a pest than Ae aegypti in the houses.

I'm seeking some clarification concerning some recent messages about
Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti.
Paul Reiter mentioned that Ae. albopictus had displaced Ae. aegypti in
a large portion of Sao Paulo province (Brazil) and appears to have displaced
dengue as well.
Are there literature references available that document these displacements?
How do you prove that Ae. albopictus actually displaced Ae. aegypti ?
Is it possible that the recent declines in Ae. aegypti populations are not
related the spread of the Asian tiger mosquito?
Should Ae. albopictus be imported into Puerto Rico or elsewhere to reduce
dengue transmission?
Aedes albopictus is often considered a peridomestic mosquito, whereas
Aedes aegypti is usually classified as a domestic mosquito. However, I must
admit that I'm somewhat unclear on how define these two species in terms of
their habitat usage in Florida and in neighboring states in the southeastern
USA.
How do we distinguish peridomestic and domestic mosquitoes?
Are these terms defined somewhere in the scientific literature?
In Florida, aquatic habitats for container-inhabiting Aedes (Ae. aegypti and
Ae. albopictus) are found almost exclusively outdoors. The only major
exception being cisterns located under houses.
Prior to the arrival of Aedes albopictus, Ae. aegypti was common in
both north and south Florida. It was found in a wide variety of artificial
containers, but was only occasionally found in natural containers, such as
treeholes or the leaf axils of bromeliads. Generally, containers with Ae.
aegypti were close to sites where humans were readily available as blood
sources. Yet, it was not unusual to find Aedes aegypti populations in areas
where there was little chance of the mosquitoes feeding on humans. Given
these facts, what would you call Aedes aegypti -
1) a domestic mosquito,
2) a peridomestic mosquito or
3) something else?
With the arrival and spread Ae. albopictus in Florida, Ae. aegypti
declined and for the most part disappeared from all types of habitats in
north Florida. In that part of the state, Ae. albopictus has become
well-established in all the habitats previously occupied by Ae. aegypti -
plus some others in which Ae. aegypti was never very common. A similar
pattern has occurred in south Florida, except here Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus seem to be coexisting in urban habitats in large cities like
Tampa, Miami, and Ft. Lauderdale. The Asian tiger mosquito now occurs in
urban, suburban, rural and sylvan habitats throughout the state of Florida
with the exception of the Florida Keys which are still the domain of Ae.
aegypti.
Although Aedes aegypti is generally depicted as primarily feeding on
humans and Ae. albopictus usually classified as a indiscriminate or
opportunistic feeder, these behavior traits may vary from region to region
or among habitats within a region. Relatively, few field studies have been
done to assess the blood-feeding habits of Aedes albopictus in which
sufficient data were obtained to compare forage ratios with blood-feeding
patterns. In a study done in Hawaii, Ae. albopictus fed on man at about the
same rate as Ae.aegypti when these mosquitoes were collected from the same
site. Around homes and businesses with just a few artificial containers, it
is difficult to collect enough blood engorged Aedes to develop a profile on
the host feeding pattern.
In north Florida communities, the annoyance to humans caused by blood
seeking Aedes albopictus females is considerably greater than that caused
previously by Ae. aegypti. I was wondering if subscribers to Mosquito-l in
other southern states have had a similar experience?

Dra Dalva Wanderley, Secretaria de Estado da Saude, Superintendencia de
controle de Endemias, Rua Paula Souza, 166, CEP 01027-000, Sao Paulo is the
person to contact. She is in charge of Ae aegypti control in Sao Paulo
state, one of the most effective organizations of its kind in the Americas.
She has lots of good quality data on the albopictus saga, and I am sure
there are publications.
I am not advocating importing albo to these shores! I have little doubt it
will not need our help to arrive, sooner or later.
As far as I remember, in Singapore, about 50% of indoor infestations are
albopictus, not aegypti.
