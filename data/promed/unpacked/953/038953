A strange disease broke out and has killed 2 people since Dec 2005 in the
district of Nharea, some 170 kilometres from Kuito, the capital city of
Angola's central Bie province.
The information was released on Tue 17 Jan 2006 by Kuito Documentation and
Information Centre (CDI) that 10 people caught the disease since it broke
out in the region; 2 of them died.
According to the source, fever and blisters followed by the deterioration
of the skin are the symptoms. It is feared to be a disease known in the
region as "Nhalai" in local vernacular language, Umbundu [A translation is
being sought, but if any readers can help, please let us know. - Mod.SH].
Meanwhile, the Head of Department of Public Health and Control of Endemics,
Jose Augusto Gonalves, said his sector has not yet been notified about the
disease. However, he said a technical team will be sent soon to Nharea to
probe into the origin of the disease.

A strange disease, which manifests through nose and skin bleeding, high
fever, and rapid weight loss, has already killed 3 people in Bie
(province), Angola.
Health minister Sebastiao Veloso said this is not Marburg haemorrhagic
fever, which killed 450 people in several provinces, but they have been
unable to [identify the disease] and people are being rushed to hospitals
in Kuito. The Health Ministry called for avoidance of direct contact with
the infected and for the maintenance of sanitary measures.
Angola revealed the existence of this ailment on 27 Jul 2005 in Malanje,
after it killed 16 people.
A spokesman for the UN Humanitarian Coordination Office for Angola (OCHA)
said the outbreak in Cambundi Catembo began with paralysis of lower limbs,
fever, cough, and convulsions.
The World Health Organization has been unable to reach the area because of
the large volume of anti-personnel mines planted there.

[It is not clear whether these 2 reports refer to the same events. The
description of the disease in the 1st report mentions skin lesions, which
might indicate a more benign infection such as monkey pox, whereas the
outbreak described in the 2nd report resembles a classic haemorrhagic
fever. Further information is requested. - Mod.CP]
