[We thank the Ministry for informing ProMED-mail of this serious threat to
foot & mouth disease-free Argentina. Unfortunately, the attachment that was
sent to the OIE was indecipherable, but it will no doubt appear shortly on
the OIE website. A news report follows. - Mod.JW

The National Service of Agrofood Health & Quality (SENASA) [of Argentina
ordered on 8 Aug 2000 the destruction of 3000 Argentinian cattle, after
they had been in contact with animals apparently infected with the virus of
foot & mouth disease which had entered in an irregular [sic manner from
Paraguay. In addition, it decided to close the frontier with that country
temporarily, as a precaution.
SENASA controls detected positive serology in contraband animals, 2 months
after the country had been declared free of foot & mouth disease without
vaccination [i.e. vaccination has ended.
