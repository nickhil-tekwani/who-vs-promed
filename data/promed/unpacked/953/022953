Glanders, Indonesia
-------------------
Information received on 24 Jan 2018 from Dr. I Ketut Diarmita, Director General of Livestock and Animal Health Services, Livestock and Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture of Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia

Summary:
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 26 Jul 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 25 Jan 2018
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Causal agent: _Buekholderia mallei_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks, total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Cengkareng Timur, Cengkareng, West Jakarta, DKI Jakarta
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Jul 2017
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 10 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: Population of 10 horses located in Cengkareng Timur village (Cengkareng sub-district, West Jakarta, DKI Jakarta province) subjected to random sampling for the purpose of establishing an equine diseases free-zone in DKI Jakarta. No clinical signs were found in the population. Up to 600 samples were taken and 435 of them were tested for glanders by the Indonesian Veterinary Research Laboratory with negative results to complement fixation test (CFT).

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 10 / 0 / 0 / 10
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: All 600 samples were also sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for glanders (Institute of Bacterial Infections and Zoonoses, Germany). One sample could not be tested at all, because of the lack of serum, and 21 samples could only be tested with immunoblot, as not enough serum was available for CFT. The 11 samples resulting suspicious, positive or anticomplementary to CFT were tested by immunoblot. For one sample, the suspicious result to CFT was confirmed by a positive result to immunoblot. Following the OIE laboratory result, the recommendation was to retest all animals with suspicious or positive results to CFT after 2 weeks. The animal confirmed positive to immunoblot should be retested immediately. Tracing and retesting of suspicious animals were conducted in December 2017. Ten samples were taken in the premises where the positive result was obtained to immunoblot and were tested to CFT in the Indonesia Research Center for Veterinary Science, resulting in one positive sample out of 10. No clinical signs were found in all 10 animals. The positive horse was sacrificed for further diagnostic testing and agent identification by bacteriological examination in the Indonesia Veterinary Research Institute.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, traceability, selective killing and disposal, disinfection, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Indonesia Research Center for Veterinary Science (National laboratory) / Equidae / complement fixation test (CFT) / 1 Aug 2017 / Positive
Institute of Bacterial Infections and Zoonoses, Germany (OIE Reference Laboratory)/ Equidae/ western blot/ 15 Dec 2017/ Positive

Future Reporting: the event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Glanders is a contagious, acute or chronic, usually fatal disease of Equidae caused by _Burkholderia mallei_ and characterized by serial development of ulcerating nodules that are most commonly found in the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and skin. Felidae and other species are susceptible, and infections are usually fatal.

The organism is infectious for people, with a 95 percent fatality rate in untreated septicemia cases, and is considered a potential bioterrorism agent.

Glanders is one of the oldest diseases known and once was prevalent worldwide. It has now been eradicated or effectively controlled in many countries, including the USA. In recent years, the disease has been reported in the Middle East, Pakistan, India, Mongolia, China, Brazil, and Africa. http://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/glanders/overview-of-glanders#v3274713.
