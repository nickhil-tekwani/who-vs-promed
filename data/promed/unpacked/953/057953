[Classical Swine Fever, sometimes refered to as Hog Cholera, can be a
devasting disease on swine farms. These 2 cases present bookend type
pictures for the epidemiology of the disease. In the Russian case,
the threat potential is very high indeed. In the Croatian case the
threat of further spread is minimal. The Russian case is disturbing
because a large, commercial swine herd is involved, we have no
information as to the source of the infection, there appears to be a
failure of vaccination as a preventive measure but no information
about the traceback or exposure ot other farms in the area. We will
be very interested in any follow up information, especially reports
of spread. Also, of note, is the recent Krasnodar and Stavropol
outbreaks of African Swine Fever, which is the main differential
diagnosis for Classical Swine Fever - see reference and excellent
commentary by Mod.AS.

The other end of the spectrum is represented by the Croatian
situation. Wild boar populations in Europe are regularly the source
of spillover into commercial herds, so it is not surprising to find 2
wild boars that are serologically and virologically positive. The
fact that these were identified on surveillance sampling indicates
the strength of the veterinary programs present to combat the disease.

A footnote of the disease statistics in this case is warranted. OIE
reports that there were 2 cases but 0 deaths, slaughtered or
destroyed animals. Moreover, the case fatality rate is 0.00. There
reason for this seemingly contradictory set of numbers is that the
animals were healthy enough to be shot by hunters and then found on
routine surveillance to be infected with CSF. We know they were cases
based on post mortem surveillance results but they didn't die of the
disease nor were they slaughtered as a prevention tactic. They were
healthy enough to be shot by hunters in the area, so they are cases
without the usual resolutions for our statistics. - Mod.PC]
