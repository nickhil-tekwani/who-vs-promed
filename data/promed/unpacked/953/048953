LARGEST OUTBREAK OF SUSPECTED MONKEYPOX REPORTED IN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
THE CONGO
Five hundred and eleven cases of suspected monkeypox were identified
between February 1996 and October 1997 in the Katako-Kombe and Lodja health
zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This constitutes the
Alargest reported outbreak of suspected monkeypox@ ever, according to the
issue of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Weekly Epidemiological
Report (WER) to be published on 5 December.
There have been two WHO-organized investigations of this outbreak to date.
During the most recent investigation, 419 suspect cases were identified in
78 villages in five health zones. Twenty-two percent of the cases were by
primary infection (thought to have arisen from human contact with infected
animals), the remainder by secondary infection (thought to have been
transmitted from infected humans to others). Serum has been collected from
over 300 cases, while crusted scabs and vesicular fluid have been collected
from 19 cases with active disease.
Preliminary laboratory results have found monkeypox virus (MPV) in nine
cases and varicella zoster virus (chickenpox) in four. Final results of the
investigation will be available once testing has been completed and the
number of chickenpox cases (which is often confused with monkeypox)
identified and removed from the study.
Human monkeypox is a severe systemic disease clinically similar to
smallpox. It is a rare sporadic zoonosis caused by monkeypox virus, an
orthopoxvirus enzootic among mammals, including monkeys and squirrels, in
the rainforest of western and central Africa.
Clinical disease in the outbreaks after February 1996 has been milder than
that reported in outbreaks during the 1980s, but the person to person
transmission has been higher, as confirmed in the WER. The apparent
alteration in transmission dynamics may be due to an increase in the number
of susceptible individuals as a consequence of the cessation of the
smallpox vaccination programme, rather than an alteration in other factors
related to transmissibility.
Transmission seems to have now ceased at the epicentre of the outbreak and
the immediate surrounding villages, the WER article reports. The more
recently detected human cases are occurring in more geographically distant
clusters, the majority with no apparent link to the original outbreak.
These cases of sporadic transmission may be due to independent
introductions of the virus into the human population perhaps through
increased animal contact. The WER article stresses that, in view of the
apparent cessation of new cases at the epicentre and with laboratory
results pending, the findings at present do not warrant the reintroduction
of vaccinia vaccination, used formerly to prevent smallpox, and which is
highly effective against monkeypox.
More details of WHO's investigations in the DRC can be found in issue no.
