As of 4 Aug 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 4 countries stands at 1711, including 932 deaths.
The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:

- Guinea, 495 cases (351 confirmed, 133 probable, and 11 suspected), including 363 deaths;
- Liberia, 516 cases (143 confirmed, 252 probable, and 121 suspected), including 282 deaths;
- Nigeria, 9 cases (0 confirmed*, 2 probable, and 7 suspected), including 1 death; and
- Sierra Leone, 691 cases (576 confirmed, 49 probable, and 66 suspected), including 286 deaths.

*[This means that for reasons that are unclear, there has been no confirmation yet from a WHO reference laboratory of any of these cases. But I would see no reason to doubt the positive results from 2 different labs in Nigeria. - Mod.JW]

Between 2-4 Aug 2014, 108 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD including 45 deaths were reported from the 4 countries as follows:

- Guinea, 10 new cases including 5 deaths;
- Liberia, 48 new cases including 27 deaths;
- Nigeria, 5 new cases including 0 death [but see above. - Mod.JW];
- Sierra Leone, 45 new cases including 13 deaths.

Health sector response
--------------------
A mission briefing with representatives from Member States was held on 5 Aug 2014 at the World Health Organization (WHO). ... Among the critical issues are: cross-border infections and travelers; partners reaching the limits of their capacity and ability to respond rapidly, safely, and effectively; and concerns about the socio-economic impact of continued transmission.

The Sub-regional Ebola Operations Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry reported on 5 Aug 2014 that the following actions are underway in the 4 affected countries:

- In Guinea, new foci have emerged, and case management facilities will be needed. Exit screening is currently being tested in Conakry, in partnership with the US CDC.
- In Liberia, security issues continue to be of concern, notwithstanding the commitment of the Government. Community resistance remains high.
- In Nigeria, the Government is focused on following up the contacts from the index case. Clinical support is urgently needed, and a treatment centre is being set up for managing cases of EVD.
- In Sierra Leone, efforts are underway to map where treatment centres are most needed and getting those set up. A similar exercise is underway for laboratories.

The SEOCC is assisting countries with these and many other response measures.

On 6 Aug 2014, WHO is convening an Emergency Committee of international experts to review the outbreak and advise the Director-General, in accordance with the International Health Regulations, whether the Ebola virus disease outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Experts will receive an epidemiological briefing and will determine whether the criteria for a PHEIC have been met. If the Emergency Committee agrees that this is a PHEIC, they will then advise the Director-General on temporary recommendations. A summary of the meeting will be made public, and a press briefing will be held on Friday, 8 Aug 2014.

[There is a table with the title:]
Confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 4 Aug 2014
---------------------------
The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by Ministries of Health.

[2] Nigeria: nurse dies
Date: Wed 6 Aug 2014
Source: Guardian UK [edited]
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/06/ebola-outbreak-nurse-nigeria-dies


A nurse who treated Nigeria's 1st Ebola victim has died of the virus in Lagos as 5 new cases of the highly lethal disease were confirmed in Africa's most populous country. The nurse had helped care for PS, a 40-year-old Liberian-American civil servant who last month [July 2014] visited from Liberia, one of 3 countries in the region hit by the world's biggest epidemic. The 5 new cases are believed to be other health workers who came into contact with PS, who died within days of his arrival.

"Yesterday [5 Aug 2014], the 1st known Nigerian to die of EVD was recorded. This was one of the nurses that attended to the Liberian. The other 5 [newly confirmed] cases are being treated in an isolation ward," the Nigerian health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, told reporters in the capital, Abuja, on Wed 6 Aug 2014.

Officials initially downplayed the risk of exposure, saying PS had been immediately isolated when he collapsed on arrival at Lagos's bustling main airport 2 weeks ago. But on Tue 5 Aug 2014, the state health commissioner, Jide Idris, said EVD was diagnosed only after PS had been taken to hospital and had direct or indirect contact with at least 70 others. They included airline passengers, airport officials and health workers, and have all been placed under precautionary surveillance; 7 have been quarantined. Officials told reporters they were compiling a list of secondary contacts and appealed to those who believed they may be at risk to come forward. "This is a call for everyone to be vigilant, especially with regard to relating to people who are ill," Idris said.

A committee has been set up to deal with any potential escalation of the disease, although Nigerian officials admitted there was a shortage of doctors willing to work directly with confirmed cases. "Our doctors are worried about the danger it poses to their lives, and they need to be reassured," said Tope Ojo, Lagos chairman of the Nigerian Medical Association. Doctors and healthcare workers on the frontline have been the hardest hit during the outbreak, which has so far killed [932] people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Authorities said they were considering applying for an experimental drug used on 2 Americans to treat the doctor who headed PS's team and is now battling the virus herself.

Other preventive measures have been unveiled across Nigeria. Lagos, a melting pot of 20 million people, has broadcast information on radios and through leaflets, distributed protective clothing to health workers and set up 4 isolation wards. In the northern state of Kaduna, officials said corpses from outside the country would require special permission for burial. Two suspected ebolavirus-infected corpses in the southern states of Anambra and Akwa Ibom are believed to be victims flown in from Guinea. Authorities have sealed the morgues while samples are being tested.

http://online.wsj.com/articles/spain-to-evacuate-ebola-stricken-priest-from-liberia-1407347679


Spain on Wednesday [6 Aug 2014] sent a specially equipped Airbus medical jet to Liberia to evacuate a Spanish priest infected with the ebolavirus, government health officials said. The stricken missionary, Father MP, 75 years old, is expected to be airlifted back to Madrid in "the coming hours," Mercedes Vinuesa, Spain's director general of public health, said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon [6 Aug 2014]. "It's a very complicated job," Ms. Vinuesa said. "We are focused on doing it with the best guarantees for the patient, for society and for health personnel. We are in the process of repatriation, which in a country like Liberia takes time."

The plane, an Airbus A310, departed from a Spanish Air Force base just outside Madrid around 1:00 p.m. local time Wednesday [6 Aug 2014], state television said. Father MP is one of 3 religious workers [the other 2 were African nationals] who are being quarantined at the San Jose de Monrovia Hospital in Liberia after having tested positive for EVD. In Spain, doctors and health officials were scrambling to make preparations to receive Father MP. Some medical workers' unions have expressed concern about whether Spanish hospitals are adequately prepared to handle an Ebola patient.

[4] Experimental drug
Date: 5 Aug 2014

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/05/us-health-ebola-drug-who-idUSKBN0G529920140805


Three of the world's leading Ebola virus disease specialists called on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014] for experimental drugs and vaccines to be offered to people in West Africa, where a vast outbreak of the deadly disease is raging in 3 countries. Noting that American aid workers who contracted the disease in Liberia were given an unapproved medicine before being evacuated back to the United States, the specialists -- including Peter Piot, who co-discovered the ebolavirus in 1976 -- said Africans affected by the same outbreak should get the same chance.

Piot, David Heymann and Jeremy Farrar, all influential infectious disease professors and respectively directors of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Chatham House Center on Global Health Security, and the Wellcome Trust, said there were several antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies and vaccines under study for possible use against ebolaviruses. "African governments should be allowed to make informed decisions about whether or not to use these products, for example to protect and treat healthcare workers who run especially high risks of infection," they wrote in a joint statement. The World Health Organization (WHO), "the only body with the necessary international authority" to allow such experimental treatments, "must take on this greater leadership role," they said. "These dire circumstances call for a more robust international response," they added.

[More than] 900 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have been killed by Ebola and more than [1700] infected since the virus started spreading in Guinea in February 2014. Nigeria said on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014] it had 8 suspected cases linked to a confirmed fatal case in a man who traveled to Lagos from Liberia [recently]. Saudi Arabia's health ministry said it was testing a suspected case in a man returning from Sierra Leone.

Two American aid workers who fell sick with EVD in Liberia saw their conditions improve by varying degrees in Liberia after they received an experimental drug called ZMapp, developed by San Diego-based private biotech firm Mapp Biopharmaceutical. Piot, Farrar and Heymann questioned why Africans were not being given the same chance. If the deadly virus was raging though wealthy countries, they said, medical agencies "would begin discussions with companies and labs developing these products and then make rapid decisions about which of them might be appropriate for compassionate use."

"Experimental treatments shouldn't be rolled out generally without prior safety testing," they said in their statement, issued in London late on Tuesday [5 Aug 2014]. "But in the face of the critical challenge in West Africa, the WHO and Western medical agencies should be helping countries weigh the risks and benefits of limited deployment of the best (drug and vaccine) candidates to those in the greatest need, while continuously monitoring safety and efficacy." A spokesman for the Geneva-based WHO told Reuters the United Nations health agency "would not recommend any drug that has not gone through the normal process of licensing and clinical trials." Treating patients with experimental drugs that have not been tested in humans to determine safety and efficacy is highly unusual.

Biotech firm Mapp and its commercial partner Leaf Biopharmaceutical said the ZMapp drug was only identified as a potential treatment candidate in January 2014 and that, as a result, very little of it was currently available. The Food and Drug Administration, the regulatory body for medicines in the U.S., said on Friday [1 Aug 2014] it "stands ready" to work with companies and investigators working with Ebola patients "in dire need of treatment."

Saudi Arabia, suspected case
-------------------------
The Saudi man who was suspected of being infected with the ebolavirus died on Wed [6 Aug 2014] in Jeddah, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said, after showing symptoms of viral hemorrhagic fever. The MOH has submitted samples from the patient to an international reference laboratory in the USA as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). Additional samples are being sent to an accredited laboratory in Germany.

Philippines: healthcare workers negative so far
---------------------------------
6 Aug 2014: A recent ProMED post (20140805.2663054) reported symptoms of EVD in 7 healthcare workers who had been in Sierra Leone and then arrived back in the Philippines. The news media 1st reported that these 7 healthcare workers had returned to the Philippines on 1 Aug 2014. A news release from the Department of Health the same day (http://www.gov.ph/2014/08/01/doh-philippines-is-still-ebola-free) reported that the Philippines remained free of Ebola. News reports later on 1 Aug 2014 misinterpreted the DOH statement as indicating that the healthcare workers had already been tested for EVD. This does not seem to be the case. The most recent accurate information, from the Philippine Star cites a press conference by Health Secretary Enrique Ona. The 7 healthcare workers are asymptomatic and are being monitored daily for symptoms during a 30-day period. They remain outpatients, and isolation units at the hospital are ready in case they exhibit any symptoms. http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/08/06/1354358/7-ofws-monitored-ebola-healthy-doh [From: Mimi Emig, MD]


Brazil: suspected cases negative
--------------------------------
5 Aug 2014: The same ProMED post (20140805.2663054) carried a report about a suspected case that arrived in Guarulhos airport, Sao Paulo. It has been ruled out based on clinical and epidemiological findings from South Africa, with a definitive diagnosis of urinary tract infection and the patient taken to Emilio Ribas (the referral hospital at Sao Paulo city) on 1 Aug 2014 and discharged on 2 Aug 2014. There was another "suspected" case on 5 Aug 2014. The final diagnosis was _P. falciparum_ malaria. [From: Rodrigo Angerami MD, Mod.ProMED-PORT]


Nigeria: PS was sick on boarding
-------------------------------
6 Aug 2014: Images from a Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) monitored here at the James Spriggs Payne's Airport have shown how the late PS was terribly ill before boarding the Nigeria bond flight. From the recording, it appears he knew he had been infected by the deadly tropical disease. His behavior, among other passengers waiting at the boarding gate, was strange. His face bore a sad countenance like someone who was troubled as he sat alone avoiding body contacts with everyone who came close by him. The video footage also shows the late PS lying flat on his stomach on the floor in the corridor of the airport, a sign of someone in excruciating pain.
