[The following report, based upon the above and 4 additional Iraqi media sources in Arabic, has been translated and submitted by a reliable source who preferred to remain unnamed. ProMED-mail is very grateful to the submitter].

Media news articles [in Arabic, translated, edited] reported in [13-14 Jun 2021] that Wasit (Governorate's) Agriculture Directorate clarified that the avian influenza infection (most likely HPAI H5N8) that has been reported, was in one of the unauthorized poultry farms in the Numaniyah district, north of the governorate.

The Director of (Wasit) Agriculture, Arkan Al-Shammari, said in a press statement that was followed by Al-Mada newspaper, that "the Directorate has taken precautionary measures in this regard, [involving] the poultry breeders in the surrounding areas at a distance of 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi], which represents the focus of the infection."

Al-Shammari pointed out that "veterinary teams carried out diagnostic field visits in the areas surrounding the index farm and took samples to avoid the spread of the infection to neighboring farms."

It is noteworthy that the Minister of Agriculture, Muhammad Karim al-Khafaji, revealed today [Sun 13 Jun 2021] the recording of cases of avian influenza in Wasit, noting that "the ministry is working seriously to end this disease in that province or Basra or other provinces that recorded some outbreaks, while referring to the ministry's efforts to compensate the owners of the farms affected by the disease.

Wasit Governorate is a governorate in eastern Iraq, south-east of Baghdad and bordering Iran (map https://reliefweb.int/map/iraq/iraq-wassit-governorate-reference-map-2020-5-may-2020).

[Earlier media reports from Iraq, kindly submitted by the same source, dated 4 Jun 2021 and published in 20210605.8425720, informed about suspected HPAI outbreak on a poultry farm in the Khor Al-Zubair area in Basrah governorate. Reportedly, the suspicion of HPAI was lab-confirmed but no final typing has been published ("most likely HPAI H5N8").

Wasit governorate is situated south-east of Baghdad, bordering Iran on its east. A map pf Iraq's governorates is available at https://www.google.co.il/search?q=iraq+governorates. Basrah governorates, Iraq's most south-east governorate, borders Iran and Kuwait. It is separated from Wasit by the governorate Missan.

Final typing results of the causative HPAI agent (most probably, H5N8) are anticipated and Further information from knowledgeable sources on the above incident will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
