Dengue Virus Serotype 1 Responsible for Outbreak in Polynesia
-------------------------------------------------------------
The following information is a very partial answer to the question posed by
the moderator regarding the serotypes of Dengue virus circulating in the
Pacific area.
Last month (15 Aug 2001) we obtained 2 isolates of Dengue virus serotype 1
from the blood of 2 French travellers who had returned from Papeete (French
Polynesia Islands).
The Polynesian Health Authorities (Inst. L. Malarde) have reported that
Dengue virus serotype 1 has been the virus responsible for dengue fever
cases since the beginning of the current epidemic.

[ProMED-mail appreciates Dr. Durand's response. We hope that it will
stimulate others to provide comparable information from other parts of the
region. - Mod.CP
