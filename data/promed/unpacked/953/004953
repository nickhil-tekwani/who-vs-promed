Cow anthrax case triggers controversy among officials over procedures validity
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture has imposed quarantine on a livestock
farm in the Dulayl area in Zarqa, where a case of anthrax was
detected. Despite a senior ministry official's assurances that the
situation is under control, experts and other officials warned that
the procedures taken do not guarantee that the problem has ended.

The case was reported last week [10-14 Nov 2008] following the sudden
death of a cow. Ministry teams responded by conducting the required
laboratory tests, Assistant Secretary General for Livestock Affairs
Nasser Hawamdeh told The Jordan Times on Saturday [22 Nov 2008].
Hawamdeh said the tests confirmed that "the causative agent of
anthrax disease" was found in the samples examined. To ensure that
the agent is not transmitted to other cows, "we destroyed and burned
the dead body, sterilised the area, and referred all farm workers for
a medical checkup," the official said, stressing that there will be
no negative impact from this case.

According to Hawamdeh, who described the situation as "not very
scary," cases of anthrax are not unfamiliar. "The ministry discovers
and successfully deals with a few cases every year. We work to
prevent the movement of animals outside the affected area for up to
21 days, which is the period required for quarantine," Hawamdeh said.

But another official familiar with the procedures, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, questioned the validity of the veterinary
measures implemented, starting from the diagnosis of the disease.
"The vet who dealt with the case applied the wrong procedure because
he performed an [necropsy] on the infected cow, a procedure that
shouldn't have been done when dealing with an anthrax case," the
source said, explaining that direct contact with the infected animal
leads to the transfer of the anthrax bacteria to humans. Instead, he
said, the cow should have been burned and buried 2 metres [7 feet]
deep at least.

According to Hawamdeh, the infection might have been transmitted from
immigrant birds, or from fodder, noting that the farm is a "model one
that applies all required sterilisation procedures".

This theory adds to the seriousness of the case, another official
source, who also requested to be unnamed, told The Jordan Times. "If
the infection was caused by immigrant birds or from the fodder, it
means the condition is so serious, since this bacteria can easily
affect the soil and surrounding environment," he said. When asked if
there was any risk to consumers' health, the ministry official said:
"I will not answer this question."

The Jordan News Agency, Petra, quoted the farm director, keeping his
identity anonymous, as denying that the cow died of anthrax, adding
that the 1800 livestock at the farm were injected with several
vaccines, including anti-anthrax one year ago.

However, livestock should be injected on an annual basis, the 1st
source said. He added that the bacteria infected the animals on the
farm because they were not given the requested vaccinations on time.

[We get few reports of anthrax from Jordan; see below that in circus
lions fed meat from a dead donkey. There have been the following
reports to OIE: 2000, 1 outbreak in small ruminants (3 died); 2001, 2
in small ruminants (6 died); 2002, one bovine outbreak (1 died), 7 in
small rumants (11 dead); 2003, 8 small ruminant outbreaks (8 deaths);
2004, 6 small ruminant outbreaks (12 dead); 2005, 3 bovine outbreaks
(3 dead), 20 small ruminant outbreaks (21 dead ... a likely
undercount from the diagnostic laboratory); 2006, 2 bovine outbreaks
(2 died), 22 small ruminant outbreaks (44 dead); and 2007, 3 bovine
outbreaks (3 dead), 15 small ruminant outbreaks (132 cases).
Fortunately animals are now tagged in Jordan so loss numbers are more reliable.

If there is any suspecion of anthrax, never open a carcass unless you
know what you are doing as it results in significant environmental
contamination and provides oxygen for the vegetative cell wanting to
sporulate. A quick diagnosis can be obtained with a fixed and stained
blood smear to check for typical organisms and the presence of a
capsul. Unless there is a risk of a bush fire, carcasses should
always be burnt; you should get the carcass up so that air can get in
underneath and you then get an efficient burn; bury the ashes and
burnt remains. If you cannot burn, bury the carcass as deep as you
can. Put any bloody soil on top of the carcass when burning and/or
soak with 5 percent formaldehyde to disinfect.

If a herd or flock is routinely vaccinated, there shouldn't be any
outbreaks in the following 9-12 months. Unfortunately new animals are
frequently not vaccinated on joining the farm. And over time this
routine vaccination should remove risk of future outbreaks when not
vaccinated. I suspect that all was not quite as described on this
farm unless they had bought contaminated forage. This contamination
occurs when hay is cut on a "champs maudit" -- a severely
contaminated site -- and soil gets into the hay, or silage. Birds do
not normally spread the infection. This can occur when vultures
having fed on a anthrax case fly to another site and bathe in a
cattle trough, thereby transfering spores from their feathers to the
livestock's drinking water.
