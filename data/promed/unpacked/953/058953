Situation (human) in Viet Nam
-----------------------------
Further details are now available for Viet Nam's 22nd case of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection as confirmed yesterday. The case was a
3-year-old boy from Lam Dong Province. His death, announced yesterday, is
the countrys 15th fatality.

Interim Guidance for Airline Flight Crews and Persons Meeting Passengers
Arriving from Areas with Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Since December 2003, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza ­--
mostly influenza A (H5N1) virus infection --­ among chickens and ducks have
been reported in several countries in Asia. Human cases also have been
reported.
No evidence for sustained person-to-person transmission of influenza A(H5N1)
has been identified; however, influenza A viruses can change rapidly, and
therefore the situation in these countries is being monitored carefully. The
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Health
Organization (WHO), and national authorities in Asian countries are working
to assess the outbreak, provide support, and assist with control efforts. As
part of this response, CDC issues interim recommendations for various
prevention and control measures.
This interim guidance is intended to assist airline flight crews and
personnel meeting arriving passengers in establishing appropriate
precautions in the event they must interact with a person suspected of
having avian influenza. Recommendations are based on standard infection
control practices and on available information on the disease.
Information on the Spread of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------
Avian influenza viruses usually do not infect humans. The ability of avian
viruses to transmit from person to person appears limited. Rare person-to-
person infection was noted in the influenza A (H5N1) outbreak in Hong Kong in
1997 and in the Netherlands in 2003, but these secondary cases did not result
in sustained chains of transmission or community-wide outbreaks. These
previous experiences with avian influenza viruses suggest that limited person-
to-person transmission of the current H5N1 viruses could occur. Infected
birds shed virus in saliva, nasal secretions, and feces.
Avian influenza viruses spread among susceptible birds when they have
contact with contaminated nasal, respiratory, and fecal material from
infected birds; however, fecal-to-oral transmission is the most common mode
of spread. Humans become infected from contact with infected poultry or
contaminated surfaces. All influenza viruses can change, and therefore it
is possible that an avian influenza virus could change so that it could
infect humans and spread easily from person to person. Because these
viruses do not commonly infect humans, there is little or no immune
protection against them in the human population.
For additional information on avian influenza, please consult this web page:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/facts.htm>.
General Infection Control Precautions
-------------------------------------
- As with all infectious illnesses, the first line of defense to prevent
transmission is careful hand hygiene. As a general rule, wash hands
frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if hands
are not visibly soiled.
- Cover your cough. Passengers who are coughing should be encouraged to
contain their coughs.
- Avoid traveling when ill.
Passengers with Symptoms of Possible Avian Influenza: Management on a
Conveyance
---------------------------------------------------
- Personnel should be aware of the symptoms of avian influenza:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/facts.htm>.
Although experience with human infection is limited, persons infected with
avian influenza would likely have fever and respiratory symptoms (cough,
sore throat, shortness of breath).
- If flight crew members or other personnel are concerned that a passenger
traveling from an area in which avian influenza cases have been reported
may be ill with a fever or respiratory illness, they should keep the sick
person separated from close contact with others as much as possible. A
surgical mask can reduce the number of droplets coughed into the air. Ask
the sick person to wear a mask if one is available, provided the person can
tolerate it (that is, if the sick person does not have such severe
difficulty breathing that he or she cannot use a mask). If a surgical mask
is not available, provide tissues and ask him or her to cover the mouth and
nose when coughing. When a sick person is unable to wear a surgical mask,
personnel should wear surgical masks when working directly with that person.
- Personnel should wear disposable gloves for direct contact with blood or
body fluids of any passenger. (However, gloves are not intended to replace
proper hand hygiene). Immediately after activities involving contact with
body fluids, gloves should be carefully removed and discarded and hands
should be cleaned. Gloves must never be washed or reused.
- The captain of an airliner bound for the United States is required by law
to report the illness to the nearest U. S. Quarantine Station prior to
arrival or as soon as illness is noted (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/quarantine_stations.htm>). Quarantine
officials will arrange for appropriate medical assistance to be available
when the airplane lands and will notify state and local health departments
and the appropriate CDC Headquarters officials. Quarantine officials will
work with the airline and local and state health departments to assist with
medical transportation of the patient upon arrival, disease control and
containment measures, passenger and crew notification and surveillance
activities, and airline disinfection procedures.
Management on Arrival
---------------------
For Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Bureau of Customs and
Border Protection (BCBP), and other personnel interacting with passengers
arriving from areas with avian influenza, CDC does not recommend protective
measures beyond those already in use for interacting with the general
public. As with all infectious illnesses, the first line of defense is
careful hand hygiene. As a general practice, personnel should wash hands
frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based rub if hands are not
visibly soiled.
Personnel who have to detain or assist a passenger who appears to have a
respiratory illness, and who may have traveled from an area with avian
influenza, should try to keep him or her separated from the other passengers
as much as possible and immediately contact the appropriate authorities,
such as the U.S. Quarantine Station with local jurisdiction
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dq/quarantine_stations.htm>, and Emergency
Medical Services (EMS). In the interim, provide the ill passenger with a
surgical mask if one is available to reduce the number of droplets coughed
into the air and if the passenger can tolerate a mask. If a surgical mask
is not available, provide tissues and ask the sick person to cover his or
her mouth and nose when coughing. When an ill passenger is unable to wear a
surgical mask, personnel should wear surgical masks when working directly
with the sick person.
Personnel should wear disposable gloves if touching blood or body fluids.
(However, gloves are not intended to replace proper hand hygiene.)
Immediately after activities involving contact with body fluids, gloves
should be carefully removed and discarded and hands should be cleaned.
Gloves must never be washed or reused.
Management of Ill Crew
----------------------
Flight crew members and ground personnel who become ill and who believe they
have been exposed to avian influenza should take the following precautions:
- If illness onset occurs while traveling away from home, notify employer
for assistance with locating a health care provider. Let employer know you
are concerned about possible exposure to avian influenza, and ask about
your health-care options.
- If illness onset occurs while outside the United States, the U.S. embassy
or consulate can also provide names and addresses of local physicians. Do
not travel while sick, and limit your contact with others as much as
possible to help prevent the spread of any infectious illness. If a visit
is planned to a doctor's office, clinic, or emergency room, tell the
healthcare provider in advance about your possible exposure so that
arrangements can be made, if necessary, to prevent transmission to others
in the health-care setting.
- If illness onset occurs after return home, contact your healthcare
provider and tell him or her what your symptoms are and the countries you
have visited before going to the doctor's office or emergency room.
Precautions can then be taken, if necessary, to prevent transmission to
others in the healthcare setting.
