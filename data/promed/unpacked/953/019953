[So far, these outbreaks are restricted to ferret-badgers. Ferret-badgers are species of the Mustelidae family, included in the _Melogale_ genus. The Formosan ferret-badger (_Melogale moschata subaurantiaca_) is a subspecies of the Chinese ferret-badger (_M. moschata_) that only occurs in Taiwan. It is reported to be an agile climber and often sleeps curled up on tree branches. Ferret-badgers are omnivorous, live in burrows or crevices, and are active at dusk and at night.
