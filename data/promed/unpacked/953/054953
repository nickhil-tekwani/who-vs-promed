I have been informed by a clinician in Cooperstown, ND, that he and his
partners have been treating an outbreak of anthrax in nearby beef herds. At
this time two practices have had the disease confirmed in 5 herds involving
a minimum of 8 deaths; a further 3 cases were awaiting laboratory
confirmation. In discussion of this outbreak with the State Veterinarian,
Dr. Larry Schuler, it is clear that other cases are occurring, which is not
unusual. All dead animals are being burnt. Vaccination is being carried out.
According to Dr Neil Dwyer at the Diagnostic Laboratory in Fargo, a Plains
Bison was diagnosed with anthrax in June this year.
Some points arising:
Owners should be made aware that the benefits of vaccination take up to 8
days to be fully implemented. Any newly vaccinated animal seen to be ill
should be taken out of the herd and treated immediately with long acting
antibiotics. As this will halt the production of any antibodies, such
animals should be revaccinated 2-4 weeks after recovering. It is wise to
check the herd twice a day for any sick animals as anthrax deaths can
otherwise occur up to 8 days after vaccination. Giving antibiotics with the
vaccine is a waste of vaccine -- Sterne is a live vaccine and the organism
is very sensitive to antibiotics. Any animals in the shoot noted to have a
temperature should be treated with antibiotics, marked, and then vaccinated
2-4 weeks later. This also applies to dairy cows being treated for
mastitis. All animals unvaccinated or improperly vaccinated will be at risk
of this disease in an outbreak. Herd vaccination should be carried out
annually for at least three years after an outbreak.
When burning carcasses, get them at least 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground
so that air can get in underneath. Otherwise combustion is incomplete and
merely from the top down -- and will take at least 3 (difficult) days. Done
right it should be consumed in some 12-18 hours, even quicker with butane
flame throwers.
