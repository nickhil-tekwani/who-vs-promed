Bluetongue: The viral circulation has re-commenced in France
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture has announced (Thu 30 Apr 2009) the 1st
French outbreak of the bluetongue virus - serotype 1 (BTV-1) in 2009.
It concerns a breeding establishment of alpacas situated in a farm at
Lavigney in the Department of Haute-Saone.

The result causes a modification in the regulated zones; only
vaccinated animals may leave the zone.

Given that the vaccination of all cattle and sheep must be completed
as soon as possible, Monsieur Michael Barnier, Minister of
Agriculture, stated that vaccination is the only way to fight this
disease.

[It will be interesting to note if this case is a new (clinically
manifested?) infection, heralding -- rather early -- the 2009
bluetongue season, which would have normally be expected not earlier
than June, or just a serological evidence of an older infection. It
would also help to note if the affected animal(s) is/are of local or
foreign origin.
