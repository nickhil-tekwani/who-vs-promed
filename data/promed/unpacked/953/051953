Measles outbreak in Gibraltar, August-October 2008 - A preliminary report
-----------------------------------------------
To date, 276 clinically diagnosed cases of measles have been notified in
Gibraltar. The outbreak, which has been ongoing since August 2008 and
affected almost one per cent of the local population, unmasked errors in
vaccination uptake assumptions and highlighted the need for improved data
recording and research on disease transmission rates in small crowded
populations.

Introduction
Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory on the Mediterranean Sea, famous
throughout the world for its history, landscape, and culture. It is
physically quite small, a peninsula with 4 square km of habitable area,
home to around 28 000 residents, which makes it densely populated, with
most people living in multistory apartments. The culture of Gibraltar is
also very community-oriented, and thus free interaction of the population
on a daily basis is the norm. These factors can augment the spread of some
infectious diseases. Gibraltar is a generally affluent nation with health
indicators on a par with western Europe and good standards of public hygiene.

During the 3 month period between 1 Aug 2008 and 31 Oct 2008, the Gibraltar
Public Health Department was notified of 276 clinically diagnosed cases of
measles. At the time of writing this report, occasional cases were still
coming in. Prior to this outbreak, no cases of measles had been notified in
Gibraltar for at least 10 years [1].

A rapid response process was put in place by the public health directorate
during the 2nd week of the outbreak. Every case clinically diagnosed as
measles was notified immediately by telephone to the infection control team
by family doctors, hospital doctors, and emergency rooms. Infection control
nurses visited every family within 24 hours, advised isolation precautions,
identified contacts, and obtained saliva samples. They found that in a
number of families, more than one person was or had been affected, although
only one individual had been reported. The rapid response process thus also
helped to maximize the ascertainment, but such intensity is difficult to
sustain for a small nation and depends heavily on skilled staff working
long hours of overtime.

Outbreak profile
After an initial period of about 5 weeks with 1-2 cases per day, the
outbreak accelerated, averaging around 5-6 notifications per day. A pattern
of mid-week peaks was observed, which is probably linked to reporting
practices. It is hypothesised that community events like the Gibraltar fair
(late August 2008), the opening of the school year (early September 2008),
and the National Day celebrations (mid-September 2008) encouraged extensive
population mixing and fueled the outbreak. More recent figures suggest that
the outbreak may have peaked, and notifications have now fallen to around
2-3 per week. [In the original, the daily notifications of measles cases in
Gibraltar (n=271) up to 31 Oct 2008 are presented graphically as a histogram]

A significant majority of the cases (62 per cent) occurred in the
school-age group (5 years to 19 years), with the youngest case 4 months old
and the oldest case 58 years old. However, age-specific infection rates
were highest in infants. Only 6 cases occurred in people over the age of 40
years. The typical case had high fever, followed by rash within 1-2 days,
red eyes, sore throat, and diarrhea. Koplik's spots were observed in many
patients. In general, the clinical course was mild with few complications.
Hospital admissions were few, mostly for management of dehydration or
superimposed infection, such as with _Mycoplasma_ pneumonia. No cases of
nosocomial transmission or cases in health staff were reported.

Confirmation
Diagnostic serology was performed for clinical reasons in just a few cases.
As part of the outbreak investigation, however, almost all cases submitted
oral fluid samples for investigation by the Virus Reference Department in
the United Kingdom (UK). For logistical reasons, the results are somewhat
in arrears. At the time of writing, 152 results had been received, of which
130 were confirmed measles (86 per cent). Of the rest, 10 had evidence of
old immunity (IgG antibodies); 5 were undergoing further PCR analysis, and
7 had no anti-measles antibodies. Results from the entire survey will form
a separate body of work. All the viruses isolated were of the Enfield
genotype D4 strain. Two of the sequences have been submitted to NCBI GenBank.

Immune status
All of the 268 clinically diagnosed measles cases for whom immunisation
histories have been ascertained occurred in persons who were unimmunised or
were partly immunised. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine immunisation
programme was 1st introduced in Gibraltar in 1989, offering a single dose
to all children at the age of 18 months. In 2002, the age was reduced to 15
months, and a preschool booster dose was added, although no catch-up was
organised at the time. All public programme vaccinations are free of charge
to all residents of Gibraltar. In addition, public health legislation
permits giving free vaccination to non-residents when indicated in the
public interest.

Childhood immunisations are generally well accepted in Gibraltar, with
uptakes of well over 90 per cent. Despite the MMR scare in the early 2000s
and the persistent media disquiet, it had been believed anecdotally that
Gibraltar's MMR uptake was also in excess of 90 per cent, but the scale of
this outbreak and the lack of computer-based records have revealed a need
to establish more precise and reliable recording systems.

A public MMR immunisation campaign was launched in the 2nd week of the
outbreak to reach all unimmunised children (under 18 years). The lower age
limit was extended to include infants at the age of 6 months and older.
Unfortunately, the campaign had to be suspended twice due to vaccine
shortages caused by the contemporaneous MMR catch-up programme in the UK,
but is now under way again. The initial phase of open access self-referrals
has so far provided around 500 vaccinations, which would comprise about
50-60 per cent of the target unimmunised population. A phase of proactive
immunisation on a child-by-child basis has been commenced to reach the rest.

Discussion
With the successful use of vaccine over several decades and the virtual
disappearance of endemic disease, elimination of measles is seen as a
realistic goal for European nations [2]. Despite public efforts to maintain
high levels of vaccination, however, sporadic outbreaks have occurred,
often a combination of disease importation [3] and existence of pockets of
non-immune populations [4]. It is believed that both factors have
contributed to the outbreak in Gibraltar.

It has occurred in the wake of a large measles outbreak caused by the same
D4 strain in the neighboring Spanish town of Algeciras and surrounding
areas, which has been ongoing since early 2008 [5]. There are large and
free movements of Gibraltar and Spanish populations every day for domestic
reasons, employment, and tourism. During May and June 2008, Spanish
authorities notified Gibraltar of 5 separate cases who had local
connections to Gibraltar (such as employment), but no evidence of local
transmission was found when these were followed up upon. However, histories
of the Gibraltar index case(s) suggested that possible interaction with the
Spanish population might have provided the source. No anecdotal or other
evidence is available to suggest that the outbreak might have been imported
to Gibraltar from other geographically or economically linked countries
where measles outbreaks have been reported, such as the UK [6], Portugal
[7], or Morocco [8]. It is theorized that Gibraltar's good herd immunity
probably held the disease at bay for several months.

Numbers in this outbreak have been relatively large and its spread
exceptionally fast when compared with accounts recently published about
outbreaks elsewhere in Europe [9]. In addition, as levels of notification
in any system are rarely 100 percent, the true outbreak size is potentially
greater.

Reported total incidence rates per 100 000 population in the literature for
measles outbreaks occurring in non-endemic countries vary widely, for
example 14.0 in Hesse (2005) [10], 39.0 in the Cote D'Azur (2003) [11] and
49.0 in Algeciras (2008) [5], but Gibraltar has experienced some 20 times
this intensity. Whilst questions on the exact uptake of the Gibraltar
immunisation programme remain, this can only account for a small part of
the difference. It is contended that the real difference arose from the
compact and densely urban nature of the Gibraltar community, enabling the
transmission of highly communicable airborne diseases to vulnerable people
with efficiency and speed. Popular folklore in Gibraltar maintains that
"when one has it, then everyone gets it", but this is the 1st time that
rapid transmission of an infectious disease to such a large proportion of
the vulnerable population has been documented here. This phenomenon needs
further research, as orthodox application of published estimates of attack
rates for infectious diseases derived from pooled or mixed populations may
be inappropriate in such island communities and result in serious
underestimates of forecast impact by planners serving atypical populations.

The immunisation drive currently underway, together with existing
vaccination coverage (and measles infection) should in time substantially
eliminate measles susceptibility in the population of under 18 year olds.
However, as the vaccination programme was commenced in 1989, most persons
over the age of 18 years will not have been immunised through vaccination.
Estimates of herd immunity are difficult to compile, as systematic
surveillance and recording only commenced in 1998, and no public record is
available of past outbreaks of measles or as to when the disease ceased to
be common. If a general presumption is made (based on the low attack rates
seen in the over 40 year olds during this outbreak) that the majority of
people over the age of 40 years will have been exposed to wild measles
virus, this leaves a population aged between 18 and 40 who could be largely
non-immune. A public health programme targeting this population needs to be
considered if measles elimination is the ultimate objective. However, such
a programme would be expensive (in perspective, this population outnumbers
the entire child population, whose immunisation has been achieved gradually
over an 18 year period), require political support and could meet with poor
compliance without a preparatory education programme.

Conclusions
A report is presented of a sudden and large outbreak of measles that has
rapidly affected nearly one per cent of the residents of the territory,
aided by a relatively crowded population and the presence of an apparently
large number of unimmunised vulnerable people. It unmasked errors in
vaccination uptake assumptions and highlighted the need to improve data
recording. The institution of a rapid response strategy, albeit very
demanding for staff, helped to optimize case management and maximize
ascertainment.

A sustained MMR vaccination promotion campaign has, in a short time,
reached over half the target (un-immunised child) population, and further
efforts are underway to reach the remainder proactively. If elimination of
measles is to be the absolute goal, attention needs to be paid to extending
immunisation to the vulnerable age group of 18-40 year olds, but such a
programme is likely to be resource-intensive.

Although most of the outbreak appears to have been controlled successfully,
vaccine shortages and scarcity of skilled staff are matters of concern to
emergency planning. Fortunately, the relative mildness of the illness did
not tax the secondary care resources as it might have done. Further
research is needed on disease transmission rates in atypical populations
like crowded urbanised neighborhoods and in island communities if planners
are to rely on such knowledge for their forecasts.

[This preliminary report documents an outbreak of measles virus infection
ongoing since August 2008 involving about one per cent of an apparently
well immunised population. Genotyping of the outbreak virus indicated that
this epidemic is an extension of a contemporaneous epidemic in the adjacent
Algeciras region of Spain and that it did not result by introduction of
virus from the UK or elsewhere. The very high attack rate in Gibraltar (one
per cent) compares with attack rates of 14-49 per 100 000 elsewhere in
Europe. This circumstance appears to be a consequence of the high density
and urbanisation of the population of the territory.
