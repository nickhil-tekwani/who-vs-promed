[1] Suggested diagnosis - CCPP
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2016
From: Richard French <vetpathdoc@yahoo.com> [edited]


Re: Undiagnosed pneumonia, caprine, ovine - Kyrgyzstan: RFI
-----------------------------------------------------------
The gross pathology is most consistent with CCPP [contagious caprine pleuropneumonia]. The unilateral nature, consolidation and pleuritis. It is also a slowly progressive disease and thus the age.

Secondary pathogens are likely as Mycoplasma impact the mucociliary apparatus.

[2] Regional transparency issue; suggested diagnosis - CCPP

Re: Undiagnosed pneumonia, caprine, ovine - Kyrgyzstan: RFI
-----------------------------------------------------------
In response to the RFI (request for information) sent to EpiCore members in Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, we received the following information:

As an expatriate living and working in the region, the current veterinary laboratory capacity in this region is limited, especially when it comes to virus isolation. PCR technologies are used infrequently as the current veterinary professionals do not have a strong understanding of molecular biology. These capabilities are slowly being introduced through our work here. Therefore definitive diagnosis is challenging here.

Additionally, official reporting is a big mystery (especially to internationals like me). During my time here, I have never been able to verify data and am unable to get that sort of information.as the local government is highly sensitive of sharing [information on] outbreaks.

Therefore, it is prudent that the individual reported not be identified, as he/she may have repercussions for releasing this information unofficially. It is concerning that the Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan border is fairly porous (for animal traffic), with no major geographic obstacles (for goats/sheep).

Local national staff (veterinarian) in the region say that when they see cases like this, they usually suspect PPR but usually only find pasteurellosis instead (probably because it's easiest to culture) ... CCPP is not high on their differentials it seems, although the pictures show unilateral cranioventral consolidation.

[We are very grateful to Dr French (item 1) for his suggested diagnosis of "black lungs" in Kyrgyzstan and to the EpiCore member (item 2) who provided 1st hand information on the concerning regional animal health situation as well as on a (similar) suggested diagnosis. We are also indebted to the subscriber who had initially raised the "black lungs" issue (20160812.4410166).

Both responses to our RFI are suggestive of the CCPP agent [_Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae_ (Mccp)] as the pathogen behind "black lungs." This is still in need of confirmation.

The recent regional distribution of CCPP, according to OIE's global CCPP distribution map (updated December 2014), is as follows: the disease is "present" in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran, and "limited to one or more zones" in China and India. There is a "current disease event" in Tajikistan. See the said map at http://tinyurl.com/jhss2lo (click on Tajikistan, zoom in). The introduction of CCPP into Tajikistan took place, reportedly, in November 2009 (see 20091104.3812).

Tajikistan has already submitted its 2015 report, according to which 3 CCPP outbreaks have been recorded during 2015 and 7784 goats officially vaccinated against the disease. The number of outbreaks in earlier years were: 2012 (32), 2013 (23), and 2014 (6).

CCPP is, in the OIE terrestrial manual's words, "manifested in goats by anorexia, fever and respiratory signs such as dyspnoea, polypnea, cough and nasal discharges. The acute and subacute disease is characterised by unilateral sero-fibrinous pleuropneumonia with severe pleural effusion. Diagnosis is carried out by clinical and necropsy observations that should be confirmed by laboratory tests. As the isolation of Mccp is difficult, molecular techniques should be the methods of choice for laboratory confirmations." Additional information, addressing diagnostic techniques, requirements for vaccines and a comprehensive reference list, is available in the manual's "Chapter 2.7.5. Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia" (15 pages, updated 2014), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.05_CCPP.pdf.

Those who are engaged in the diagnosis and control of CCPP, in Kyrgyzstan and elsewhere, and who need any further information on diagnostic tests, reagents and vaccines for the disease, are encouraged to contact OIE's reference expert/laboratory: Dr Fran√ßois Thiaucourt, CIRAD-UMR, Control of exotic and emerging animal diseases, Campus International de Baillarguet TA A-15/G, 34398 Montpellier cedex 5 France.
