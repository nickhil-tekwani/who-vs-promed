Affected population: individual wild grey herons (_Ardea cinerea_)
Description of affected population: resident waterfowl (including ducks,
geese, swans) and resident greater flamingo population in nature park areas
with some wild ardeid birds affected at a nature park and at a pond in a
reclamation area.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks:
outbreak/susceptible/cases/deaths/destroyed/slaughtered
Ref. 1 / 95 waterfowl / 31 / 31 / 64 / 0
/ >500 egrets / ... / Â± 20 / 2 / 0
Ref. 2 / 207 waterfowl / 104 / 89 / 0 / 0
/ 130 flamingos / 16 / 12 / 4 / 0
Ref. 3 / ... / 2 / 2 / 0 / 0
Diagnosis:
Outbreak Ref. 1:
Reports of waterfowl dying in a nature park were made to the management on
3 Dec 2002, but the first deaths were noted on 30 Nov 2002.
Date of sampling: 4 Dec 2002. Date of report: 9 Dec 2002.
Outbreak Ref. 2: Dead ducks in a zoological garden waterfowl collection
were necropsied on 17 Dec 2002 and samples were taken.
Date of report: 19 Dec 2002 for rapid tests and 21 Dec 2002 for virus
isolation.
Outbreak Ref. 3: A grey heron found dead at a pond reclamation area
adjacent to a construction site was submitted as part of surveillance of
wild birds in ponds and marshes subsequent to egret deaths in outbreak
Ref. 1. Date of sampling: 17 Dec 2002. Date of report: 20 Dec 2002.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory,
Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department, Hong Kong, and further
virus characterisation at Department of Microbiology, Hong Kong University.
B. Diagnostic tests used: viral culture, influenza A antigen
detection,immunoperoxidase test with H5 avian influenza specific monoclonal
antibodies, H5 genome detection.
- Chick embryo inoculation with haemagglutination inhibition testing by
specific reference sera from CVL(1) Weybridge, United Kingdom.
- Immunoperoxidase staining of tissues by H5 specific monoclonal antibodies.
- Genome detection by RT-PCR(2) tests using H5 specific primer sets from
SEPRL(3), Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.
- Virus genomic characterisation is in progress by gene sequencing using
specific primer sets for all eight gene segments at Hong Kong University.
C. Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: wild bird introduction suspected.
B. Other epidemiological details: the disease has remained within the pond
systems.
Control measures:
Outbreak Ref. 1: All waterfowl were depopulated and the park was closed for
disinfection. No restocking will be permitted until further discussions
with the management.
Outbreak Ref. 2:
- As this is a collection of rare species, all waterfowl and flamingos have
been placed in segregated quarantine facilities on-site, away from the
public, and are under close observation by staff.
- Vaccinations using killed H5 avian influenza vaccine have been given to
resident waterfowl and flamingos.
- Sick birds are moved to individual pens.
- All ponds have been emptied and disinfected and strict biosecurity
procedures are being followed by staff.
Outbreak Ref. 3: Barrier lines have been strung across the pond, water
levels have been raised and feeding has been stopped to discourage wild
birds from entering this pond system to feed.
(1) CVL: Central Veterinary Laboratory.
(2) RT-PCR: reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Hong Kong, Special Administrative
Region Of The People's Republic Of China
Follow-up report no. 1 (disease detected in commercial poultry farms)
See also: 24 Jan 2003, 27 Sep 2002, 31 May 2002 Information received on 17
Jan 2003 from the Director of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department, Hong Kong:
End of previous report period: 28 Dec 2002 (see Disease Information, 16
[4], 21, dated 24 Jan 2003).
End of this report period: 14 Jan 2003.
New outbreaks:
Location: Ta Kwu Ling, New Territories
No. of outbreaks: 1
Tai Kong Po, New Territories
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population in the new outbreaks: multiple age
groups of broiler chickens in A-frame cages in both outbreaks.
Total number of animals in the new outbreaks:
outbreak / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
No. 1 / 16 000 / 2500 / 2500 / 13 500 / 0
No. 2 / 51 000 / 3000 / 3000 / 9000 / 0
Diagnosis:
Outbreak No. 1: Surveillance testing of dead birds from a wholesale poultry
market on 26 Dec 2002 gave a suspicious reaction for H5 infection, which
was followed by monitoring of local farms that supplied the market the
previous evening. An infected farm was detected.
Date of sampling: 27 Dec 2002. Date of report: 28 Dec 2002. Estimated date
of first infection: 17 Dec 2002.
Outbreak No. 2: Farmer reported 30 dead chickens in 98-day-old flock on 7
Jan 2003 (morning) and veterinary inspection showed over 150 dead in 3
sheds plus 3 percent birds with congested and cyanosed combs/wattles that
morning.
Date of sampling: 7 Jan 2003. Date of report: 7 Jan 2003. Estimated date of
first infection: 4 Jan 2003.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: see emergency report.
B. Diagnostic tests used: see emergency report.
C. Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1 virus
genetically different from HK/1997 (H5N1). The genome sequence for the
haemagglutinin cleavage site coded for multiple basic amino acids.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: infected wild bird involvement
suspected.
B. Other epidemiological details: there are no direct fomite links between
outbreaks Nos. 1 and 2.
Control measures during reporting period:
Outbreak No. 1: - Immediate quarantine and depopulation was undertaken with
cleaning and disinfection on 28 Dec 2002.
- As a precautionary measure, the wholesale poultry market was closed for
intensive cleaning and disinfection and the retail live poultry markets
were closed on 1 Jan 2003 for intensive cleaning and disinfection.
- Ring vaccination using killed oil-adjuvanted H5N2 vaccine was conducted
on 13 farms in the district around the outbreak farm.
- Intensive farm surveillance for the disease was commenced.
Outbreak No. 2: - Immediate farm quarantine was started with vaccination on
8 Jan 2003 of all chickens in unaffected sheds that were segregated from
the affected sheds.
- Ring vaccination was also conducted on the other 8 farms in the district
around the outbreak farm on 8 Jan 2003.
- Slaughter of birds in the affected sheds was conducted on 10 Jan 2003.
