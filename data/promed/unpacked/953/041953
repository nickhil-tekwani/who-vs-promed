New Jersey: First Equine Cases since 2000
-----------------------------------------
The first case since 2000 of eastern equine encephalitis in a horse
in New Jersey has been found in a thoroughbred in Mays Landing.
[That's an expensive horse lost for want of a $20 shot! - Mod.JW].
The diagnosis comes as the region contends with an explosion in the
mosquito population from a wetter-than-usual summer. The 8-year-
old horse became ill on 6 Aug 2003 and declined quickly, and was
euthanized the next day, the state Department of Agriculture said.
Blood tests later confirmed the horse had the mosquito-borne
disease, which can also affect humans. Agriculture Secretary
Charles M. Kuperus said the death highlighted the need for horse
owners to make sure their animals have up-to-date vaccinations.
Mosquito control officials said they had been taking steps to control
the mosquito population, but they also called on homeowners to
remove any stagnant water on their properties that can serve as
breeding grounds.
The state health department last month warned that eastern equine
encephalitis had been detected earlier in the season than ever
before, after the virus was found in mosquitoes in Burlington
County. It usually appears in mosquitoes in late summer and early
fall.
Although there is a vaccine for horses, none exists for humans.
Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare but serious disease [in
humans] that causes an inflammation of brain tissue. Early
symptoms in humans include fever, headache, and changes in
mental status, the health department said.

[The vaccine for horses is cheap insurance against a deadly
disease. The vaccine should be administered approximately a month
prior to the beginning of mosquito season. This is a series of 2
vaccines, given as an initial dose and repeated in 2-3 weeks. Often
eastern equine encephalitis virus vaccine is combined in a vaccine
that also contains Western & Venezuelan equine encephalitis
viruses. There is also a vaccine that combines these 3 with tetanus
toxoid as well.
Owners who wait until there is an outbreak of eastern equine
encephalitis to vaccinate may find that they are playing roulette with
the life of the animal, which may not have time to mount an immune
response. - Mod.TG]
