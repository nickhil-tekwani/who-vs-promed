[2] Vaccination campaign reaches taxi motorcyclists and cyclists
31 May 2018. DRC reports more suspected Ebola cases in Iboko
[CIDRAP, edited] http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/05/news-scan-may-31-2018

The health ministry said yesterday [Thu 31 May 2018] that its communication team had awareness sessions with 200 cyclists and motorcycle taxis drivers in Mbandaka, the provincial capital, to teach them about precautionary measures to prevent Ebola infection, given that the drivers are frequently used to take sick patients to health centers, posing hazards to drivers and other passengers.

During the meetings, health officials identified 5 drivers who had been in contact with confirmed Ebola case-patients. The drivers are now being monitored and have agreed to be vaccinated.

31 May 2018. DRC-Ebola: Already 561 vaccinated, including drivers who had transported patients who had escaped.

Since the launch of the vaccination on [Mon 21 May 2918], 561 people have been vaccinated, including 444 in Mbandaka, 74 in Bikoro and 43 in Iboko, reports the Ministry of Health. Among those vaccinated in Mbandaka, there are motorcycle taxi drivers who have been in contact with confirmed cases of Ebola. They had transported patients who had escaped from Wangata General Hospital in mid-May.

This [Wed 30 May 2018], the communication team of the Ministry of Health has sensitized more than 200 tolekists (cyclists) and motorcycle taxi drivers of the city on the precautionary measures to take to protect against the Ebola virus disease.

"This is a priority target because bicycles and motorcycle taxis are the most popular means of transportation for the population in Mbandaka. When a person is sick, they are often transported by these tolekists or motorcycle taxis to the nearest health center. This is a real danger for the drivers themselves, but also for their future passengers," says the Ministry of Health.

[3] Ebola vaccine development
31 May 2018. Vaccines central to efforts to head off latest Ebola outbreak
[Chemistry World, edited] https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/vaccines-central-to-efforts-to-head-off-latest-ebola-outbreak/3009094.article [Byline: Maria Burke]

Ring vaccination strategy could halt disease in its tracks provided health systems can cope

The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has started to vaccinate high-risk populations against the Ebola virus following a fresh outbreak of the disease - the 9th Ebola outbreak in the country. The vaccine has yet to be licensed but was found safe to use in trials in 2016.

International agencies reacted swiftly and dispatched more than 7500 doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. 'Vaccination will be key to controlling this outbreak,' says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general. The plan is to use 'ring vaccination', which involves identifying and offering the vaccine to contacts and contacts of contacts of anyone likely to be infected. This forms a buffer of immune individuals to prevent the spread of the disease. The vaccination campaign will operate under clinical protocol - similar to a clinical trial - that requires trained medical staff and informed consent.

'Implementing the Ebola ring vaccination is a complex procedure,' says Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. 'The vaccines need to be stored at a temperature of -60 [-76°F] to -80°C [-112°F] so transporting them and storing them in affected areas is a major challenge.' The WHO has sent special carriers, which can keep their contents at sub-zero temperatures for up to a week and has set up freezers to store the vaccines in Mbandaka and Bikoro.

Vaccine successes
'Had a vaccine been available earlier alongside other critical public health interventions in the devastating epidemic of 2014-2016, thousands of lives might have been saved,' comments director of the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar. 'Thanks to rapid national response and global collaboration, this time around we are in a better position to protect the communities at risk and health workers. But this will be an incredibly challenging operation, across a vast area and fragile health systems, and cannot be limited to deployment of vaccines.'

The vaccine, manufactured by Merck and Co as V920, uses a genetically engineered version of vesicular stomatitis virus, an animal virus that primarily affects cattle, to carry an Ebola virus gene insert. Trials using ring vaccination with V920 in Guinea in 2015 showed that it provided substantial protection and was safe for use. Among the thousands of people who received the vaccine, no Ebola cases were recorded 9 days or more after vaccination (ref.1).

The vaccine has gone through Phase III trials but has not yet been licensed by relevant regulatory authorities. Merck, which is co-developing V920 with NewLink Genetics, plans to release data from Phase III trials later this year [2018]. While the vaccine is awaiting review, the WHO recommended its use under its emergency use and assessment listing during Ebola outbreaks linked to the Zaire strain, such as the one in the DRC. In addition, Merck reached an agreement with the vaccine alliance Gavi to ensure that 300 000 investigational doses of the vaccine are available in case of an outbreak. It is these doses that are being used in the DRC.

Other options
Several other vaccines are also in development, including candidates from Johnson and Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline. GSK's vaccine has been through Phase II trials, but did not complete Phase III efficacy testing. The company says it has stockpiled doses and is closely monitoring the current situation. GSK also has earlier stage vaccine candidates and therapeutics to treat the disease. There are also more than 10 programmes in preclinical development.

Johnson and Johnson with Bavarian Nordic are developing a 2-dose vaccination approach. There are 11 Phase I, II and III clinical studies underway into Ebola therapies at present. Final clinical data from a Phase I vaccine study conducted in the UK were published last March [2018] (ref. 2). In September 2016, the company applied for emergency use permissions from the WHO, which is still under review.

Meanwhile, Chinese regulators approved an Ebola vaccine in October 2017 that was co-developed by the Bioengineering Institute of the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences and private drugmaker Tianjin CanSino Biotechnology who reported encouraging Phase II trials (ref. 3). CanSino has used a freeze-drying technique known as lyophilisation to prepare the vaccine so it can be stored at 4°C [39.2°F] for long periods of time, and remains stable at 37°C [98.6°F]
for about 3 weeks. This means it could be more suitable for conditions in countries like the DRC where the healthcare system is often fragmented.

[The DRC MOH update for Thu 31 May 2018 reports 5 new suspected cases, including 2 in the Wangata section of Mbandako which was the source of the 1st urban cases in the current outbreak. Hopefully all of the new suspected cases are coming from the cohort of known identified contacts of earlier confirmed cases who are under continuing close observation. In addition to the DRC MOH announcements and the periodic WHO external situation reports, one may also turn to the MSF Ebola update for May 2018 for a high-level summary of the epidemic from one of the major players on the ground: http://www.msf.org/en/article/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-update-may-2018.

The DRC, WHO, and MSF are to be commended for the rapid implementation of the Ebola vaccine campaign, which is clearly scaling up in numbers. However, the absolute number of vaccinees (vaccinated individuals) being announced daily is not that meaningful without knowing the total number of targeted individuals. Several days ago, these agencies announced that vaccination efforts had shifted from urban Mbandako to the rural epicenters of Iboko and Bikoro, so one assumes that individuals targeted for vaccination in Mbandako were sufficiently reached. Nevertheless, it would be helpful to know what percentage of hoped-for vaccinees are actually getting vaccinated.

So rather than focus on the numbers, in part [2] we touch on the question of who should be vaccinated besides healthcare workers and family and friends in contact with Ebola patients. Amongst the general working population, perhaps no group is at higher risk than taxi motorcyclists and taxi cyclists (an awkward English neologism for the local term "tokelists" used in the article). Taxi motorcyclists transport sick patients not only in the DRC, but throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa. That these taxi workers are at very high risk in the midst of an Ebola epidemic is not hard to understand given this typical scenario: a sick Ebola patient, unable to support himself, is propped up on the back of the motorcycle or bicycle between the driver and a friend or relative of the patient, who may be sweating, salivating, or vomiting onto the neck and back of the driver en route to the hospital (or, in the case of the Wangata "escapees", from the hospital). Given these local economic facts of life, the outreach effort to include taxi cyclists and motorcyclists is very encouraging.

Much ink has already been expended, figuratively speaking, on the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine currently being deployed for Ebola contacts and healthcare workers in Mbandaka and Bikoro. The Chemistry World article [part 3] provides a good summary of other EV vaccines in development, including candidates from JandJ and GlaxoSmithKline, 2 very experienced vaccine makers. These other vaccine candidates, however, have undergone even less clinical testing than rVSV-ZEBOV, and it is hard to imagine how to design an ethical clinical trial for untested new Ebola vaccines. A proper clinical trial would normally include a blinded arm using the best available treatment, if available, for direct comparison. But the rVSV-ZEBOV proved so efficacious compared to a sham negative control in the 2015 Guinea clinical trial that the trial was ended early. Given such demonstrated benefit, what potential Ebola vaccine recipient would volunteer for a blinded clinical trial in which he or she would have a 50:50 chance of receiving an unproven vaccine instead of rVSV-ZEBOV?

Conventional vaccines also require a continuous cold chain of -60 [-76°F] to -80°C [-112°F] to preserve the product from factory to patient, and much has been written about the challenges of building and maintaining such a cold chain in poor tropical countries. Some fertile engineering minds are turning their attention to potential solutions to this problem, and the following Wired article provides an entertaining behind-the-scenes look at one high-tech approach: : https://www.wired.com/story/the-wild-logistical-ride-of-the-ebola-vaccines-high-tech-thermos/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&utm_campaign=3a1d20f79e-MR_COPY_03&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-3a1d20f79e-149684921

The last Ebola vaccine candidate covered in the Chemistry World article comes from 2 unlikely developers, a private Chinese biotech company and the Chinese Academy of Military Medicine. However, this CanSino vaccine offers a distinct practical advantage: lyophilized long-term storage at conventional refrigerator temperatures, followed by a room temperature shelf life of 3 weeks. Even given the vast undeveloped swaths of the DRC, 3 weeks is probably enough time to reach any part of the country. So even if this particular vaccine is never deployed in the DRC Ebola outbreak, obviating the need for a cold chain seems like such a good a priori idea that that should be a desirable technical requirement for any future vaccine contemplated for use in tropical low-resource countries.

Finally, although vaccines are now being hailed as "key to controlling this outbreak," it is worth reiterating that case finding, contact tracing, and vaccine acceptance are ultimately more important than vaccine efficacy per se: a 100 percent protective vaccine that is administered to only 25 percent of the needed population would be a less effective epidemic control tool than a vaccine that offers only 50 percent protection but reaches 90 percent of the target population.
