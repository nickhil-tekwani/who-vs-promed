[The December flock outbreak which appears to have been an isolated case
not a continuing outbreak, occurred in Fukuoka prefecture -- the same
location as this case. This may also be an isolated case, but further
information on the potential for a vaccine break or other cause of the
infected would be most interesting. - Mod.PC]
