[1] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Manicaland)

At least 16 people have died and hundreds more are ill after a fresh
cholera outbreak in eastern Zimbabwe, according to state run media on Mon 8
Nov 2010. The state-controlled Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation reported
that the epicenter of the latest cholera outbreak is in Marange District of
Manicaland Province, killing at least 16 people since October 2010.

"13 were community deaths where the people died at their homes and 3 were
institutional deaths," said Zimbabwean deputy minister of health and child
welfare, Douglas Mombeshora.

Mombeshora said another 669 people are suspected to be suffering from
cholera, while 86 others are confirmed to have cholera. Most of the cases
are reportedly linked to illegal diamond mining activities in Chiadzwa,
where miners live in unhygienic conditions. The new outbreak comes only
months after most of the country's ongoing cholera epidemic appeared to
have passed. The epidemic, which began in August 2008, killed at least 4300
people and sickened up to 100 000 others.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Eastern region)

The East Akyem municipal director of health services, Dr Ekow Kwaitoo, says
all necessary interventions are being put in place to control the cholera
outbreak in the area. He asked the public not to panic since the various
health centres in the municipality have been asked to strengthen their
surveillance.

Dr Kwaitoo who was speaking to Radio Ghana at Kyebi said 56 suspected cases
have so far been recorded without death since the Health Directorate
detected the problem a fortnight ago [the fortnight is a unit of time equal
to 14 days. The word derives from the Old English feowertyne niht, meaning
"14 nights" <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnight>. - Mod.LL]. Among the
places affected he said are Asiakwa, Asikam, Adadientem, Potroase, Kyebi,
and Apapam which is leading.

Dr Kwaitoo described cholera as a disease that occurs during the rainy
season and advised the public to keep their environment clean to check any
further outbreak. The East Akyem municipal chief executive, Simon Peter
Asirifi, said Epidemic Implementation Committee including NADMO [National
Disaster Management Organisation], Environmental Health, Water and
Sanitation Committee, as well as the Information Services Department is on
the ground to assist the Health Directorate control the outbreak.

The acting matron of the kibi Government Hospital, Augustina Tsekpetse,
said only 4 out of the 56 victims were still in the hospital on Friday [5
Nov 2010] while all the rest had been treated and discharged.

[3] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (Western province)

Papua New Guinea's [PNG] cholera outbreak appears to have spread. 13
children have died on a remote island near the maritime border with
Australia in the Torres Strait.

Infection rates have slowed after the outbreak began on PNG's north coast
in August 2009 and spread throughout the mainland. Now the disease appears
to have surfaced on remote Daru Island, 50 km [31 mi] from Saibai Island on
the Australian side of the Torres Strait.

The National newspaper reports 13 children have died from cholera-like
symptoms and 64 other people are being treated in the local hospital.

Australia's aid agency AusAID is monitoring the situation and working to
confirm the details.

[Daru Island is the name of an island in the Western Province of Papua New
Guinea, the town on the island goes by the same name and is the capital of
the province. The island is separated from the mainland in the north,
specifically the mouth of Oriomo River, by 3.5 km (2.2 mi) wide Daru Roads.
Daru Island is one of the few of the Torres Strait Islands that do not
belong to Australia, but to Papua New Guinea, and is the most highly
populated of all Torres Strait Islands, although scarcely any Torres Strait
Islanders live on the island.

As can be seen on the maps at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daru_Island>
and <http://healthmap.org/r/0frF>, the island is much closer to Papua New
Guinea than to mainland Australia. - Mod.LL]

[4] Dysentery, post-cyclone - Myanmar (Rakhine)
Date: Mon 1 Nov 2010

An outbreak of dysentery has compounded the crisis in western Burma's
Arakan state [currently Rakhine] where some 100 people were killed by a
cyclone 10 days ago. More than 200 people have fallen ill and 4 are since
reported to have died in the towns of Kyaukphyu, Minbya, and Myebon, where
swathes of property were flattened by the cyclone.

Dr Aye Maung, chairman of Rakhine (Arakan) Nationalities Development Party,
said the dysentery outbreak was caused by a lack of clean drinking water.

Aid has arrived in the isolated coastal region, but locals there say more
is needed. Aye Win, spokesperson for the UN Information Centre in Rangoon,
told DVB that communication with affected areas was difficult, with the
Arakan region harder to access than the country's southern Irrawaddy delta,
which was hit by the devastating cyclone Nargis in May 2008.
