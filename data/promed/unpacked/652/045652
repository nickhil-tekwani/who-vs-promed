Measles outbreak in Switzerland: update
---------------------------------------
Swiss federal health authorities late Thursday [5 Feb 2009] issued an
alert about the measles outbreak in Vaud this week, reminding people
that the virus causes serious illness and vaccinations are the only
protection against the potentially deadly disease.

Since the start of 2009, 50 new cases have been declared in
Switzerland, half of them this week alone, in Vaud [canton] -- the
number of cases seen in a total year when there is not an epidemic.
Four new schools were affected Thursday [5 Feb 2009] when brothers
and sisters of the 17 students with measles from the Rudolf Steiner
school in Crissier also fell ill. Children and teenagers who have not
been vaccinated and who have had contact with anyone with measles
must by law be sent home for 3 weeks.

Bern noted that since November 2006 Switzerland has seen 3400 cases
of measles, with one death last week [week of 26 Jan 2009] in Geneva,
250 hospitalizations and 500 complications that included 143 cases of
pneumonia and 8 cases of encephalitis. Six people have died in Europe
from measles in recent years. There is no [specific] treatment for the disease.

93 percent of those treated for measles in Switzerland were not fully
vaccinated. The government recommends 2 vaccinations, at 12 months
with a follow up at 15-24 months. One concern is young people who
received the initial vaccination but not the follow up. Health
authorities recommend vaccinations for anyone born after 1963 who is
not vaccinated and who has not had measles.

Bern notes that measles has been eradicated in North and South
America as well as in Finland [the Americas have interrupted endemic
transmission of measles virus, but there are period small outbreaks
related to imported cases. For an excellent summary graph of these
cases/outbreaks, see the Measles/Rubella Weekly Bulletin Vol 12,
Issue 2, 17 Jan 2009 available at
<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/FCH/IM/sme1502.pdf> - Mod.MPP] .
Switzerland is the hardest hit country in Europe, with its 3-year-old
epidemic and the only way to eradicate the disease is to achieve a 95
percent vaccination coverage for young children. Nationwide, the
coverage is currently 86 percent.
