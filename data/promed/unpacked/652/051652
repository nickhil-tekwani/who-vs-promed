Another horse dies from hendra virus
------------------------------------
A total of 9 horses in Queensland and 4 in New South Wales (NSW) have
died from hendra virus in the last month. Authorities have confirmed a
9th horse has died from the hendra virus in Queensland.

Biosecurity Queensland says the horse was euthanized at a property in
Logan, south of Brisbane, late last month [June 2011]. The horse
initially tested negative to hendra. But secondary testing showed it
previously had a hendra virus infection and had developed antibodies
to the disease.

A total of 6 people who were exposed to the sick animal have tested
negative to signs of the virus.

There have been 7 outbreaks of hendra in Queensland this year. 9
horses in Queensland and 4 in NSW have died from the disease over the
past 3-and-a-half weeks.

[There is something odd about this article. If this is the 9th horse,
why are hearing about it in late July if it was euthanized in late
June? And if it was euthanized in late June then it would have been
one of the 1st horses, not the 9th. So I find this a little confusing.


Sadly, the vaccine under development will not be available until next
year, likely. However, if the vaccine were far enough along to be
available on a provisional testing, this seems like an opportunity to
test it.

Horse owners should be reminded that fruit trees and fig trees are
particularly attractive to the flying fox. So fence the horses away
from the fruit until it is gone.
