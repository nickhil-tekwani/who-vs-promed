[The spread of Bluetongue westward in Belgium continues, although
there are not so many new outbreaks this week. It is interesting to
look at sequential date maps in order to get an idea of the rate and
extent of spread westward. Such maps can laboriously be gathered by
looking at individual OIE reports. - Mod.PC]
