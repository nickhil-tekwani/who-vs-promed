The situation with measles in Ukraine has stabilized, although it is too early to say about reducing the incidence rate. This was announced at a briefing by the director of the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health Volodymyr Kurpita. He noted that from [Mon 19 - Sun 25 Feb 2018] nearly 800 people became ill with measles in Ukraine: 294 adults and 489 children. This is 5 per cent less than last week [week ending Sun 18 Feb 2018].

"We can state that the situation with the measles in Ukraine has stabilized, we are not talking about reducing the incidence, but about stabilizing the process," he said. According to Kurpita, since the beginning of the year [2018], 5839 Ukrainians [have been] ill with measles: 1981 adults and 3857 children. Almost 4000 patients [have been] hospitalized.

Over the past week [week of Sun 18 Feb 2018], the 7th case of death was reported due to complications from measles in 2018. This was a newborn child in the Odesa region, who lived only a few hours after birth.

In 2017, the level of routine vaccination has doubled compared with 2016. Up to 93.3 per cent of children under one year old and 90.7 per cent of 6 year old children were vaccinated.

[According to 2016 data from the World Health Organization (WHO), Ukraine ranks lowest in terms of vaccination coverage in Europe. At the end of 2016, fewer than 50 per cent of one year olds had been vaccinated against measles.

The solution sounds easy; parents need to immunise their children against this deadly disease, it's the only way to be protected. But in Ukraine, the problem is always more complicated.

Low levels of coverage are the result not only of parents' choice but of limited availability of vaccines over the past 7 years. In addition, the myths about vaccination as being potentially harmful, and the lack of consultation among parents and health workers, meant that Ukraine's coverage against measles dramatically dropped from 97 per cent in 2007 to 42 per cent in 2016.

UNICEF has delivered vaccines at the request of the Ministry of Health since 2016.

The positive news is that the trend shows parents are more inclined to vaccinate their children today than 9 years ago. More than 76 per cent of parents now support vaccination in Ukraine. Surveys also prove that as parents are better informed about the risks of diseases, they are more likely to support vaccination. But we still need to do better.

The Toulouse University Hospital calls for vigilance after cases of measles in the region. Up to 12 cases of this disease identified in Agen in high school students after a school trip to Spain.

Measles is a highly contagious viral infection. The symptoms are high fever, cough, rhinitis and conjunctivitis, followed by rash. Be careful, this is not a mild illness.

The Toulouse University Hospital recalls some simple principles concerning this disease. The symptoms can begin at any time from 7 -- 18 days after being in contact with the person with measles. The hospital reminds that in case of doubt it is necessary to consult your doctor quickly.

The measles outbreak in Greece is showing no signs of slowing down, with the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (KEELPNO) saying [Thu 1 Mar 2018] that there have been 1829 recorded cases since last May [2017].

The center said the number of cases has doubled in the first 2 months of the year [2018], compared with 922 reported in late December [2017].

According to KEELPNO, there have so far been 3 measles-related deaths in under a year.

Roma children make up around 70 per cent of cases while the rest are mostly people aged between 25 and 44 who have either not been vaccinated or who may have had their 1st shot but never followed up with the 2nd.

As many as 4 children have died due to outbreak of measles in Katan Payen and Charkom areas of district Upper Dir during the last couple of days, raising concerns among the villagers. According to local residents, a 2 year old minor girl died on [Fri 2 Mar 2018] in Katan Payen area. Three more children have died in the past few days in the 2 villages including 2 sons of one, Waheedullah.

The deaths of 4 kids raised concerns among the local residents who demanded of the health authorities to immediately send teams to the affected areas so that the epidemic could be controlled before it could claim more lives.

Meanwhile, district health officer Iftikhar-ud-Din has said that medical teams had been sent to the 2 villages, adding the affected children were being provided medical facilities.

On the verge of a measles catastrophe, [Pakistan] is facing an increasing number of reported cases compared to 2016. For the previous and current year, a report by WHO presents a dire picture of Pakistan's weak surveillance. The numbers reveal that Pakistan not only experienced a significantly higher number of cases than the entire region, but that cases rose by more than 100 per cent in 2017, compared with the previous year [2016].

According to the Measles-Rubella Bulletin, the data analysis on the region reports 6494 cases in 2017, while in 2016 the reported cases were 2845. A total 10 540 suspected cases were tested in the lab from 1 Jan -- 31 Dec 2017 and 6494 of them were positive.

The report states that although all the suspected cases were tested in the lab, none were investigated for further action and planned campaigns. The country reportedly received 367 Rubella cases for the same year.

Public health crisis in Pakistan
War-ravaged Afghanistan tested 2321 cases in the same period, with 1511 confirmed measles cases.

In 2016, Pakistan tested 5871 cases, 2845 of which were confirmed positive. Measles incidence for the year was 16.06 per cent and has gone up to 36.67 per cent in 2017. The officials fear the actual number may be much higher.

Under the national schedule, children between the ages of 9 and 15 months should be vaccinated, but the Expanded Programme on Immunisation failed to ensure this, even as the numbers crept higher. The administration not only failed to detect outbreaks but also did not respond to them on time.

Last year [2017], a meeting conducted by the Pakistan Health and Population Strategic Forum, chaired by federal minister for national health services Saira Afzal Tarar, took notice of the measles situation. The minister agreed to launch a measles vaccination campaign in high-risk areas in April, and a nationwide anti-measles drive in October 2018. They also decided to release a plan of action with mutual consultation among all provinces.

Old diseases, old problems
Health experts admit that a nationwide measles campaign should have been launched in the 2nd half of 2016 or the 1st quarter of 2017, but due to the poor status of regular immunisation in all provinces except Punjab, it was never achieved.

According to WHO standards, 95 per cent coverage is the necessary rate to avert an outbreak as the disease is highly infectious. Even reaching the 80 per cent coverage threshold will avert large-scale outbreaks. Except for Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, all other provinces and territories report 50 per cent or less vaccine coverage.

[6] New Zealand (Auckland) ex Singapore alert

Travellers who arrived at Auckland International Airport on Singapore Air flight SQ285 from Singapore at 11.45 am on [Thu 22 Feb 2018] may have been exposed to measles, says the Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS).

Medical officer of health Dr Michael Hale says passengers in rows 31 -- 49 were closest to the measles case and are at highest risk, but any one on the flight should watch out for symptoms. Dr Hale says symptoms may appear tomorrow or over the next 8 days. "If anyone who may have been exposed knows they don't have immunity to measles they can be vaccinated, and that could prevent the symptoms developing," he says. The 1st symptoms are a fever, and one or more of a runny nose, cough and sore red eyes. After a few days a red blotchy rash develops.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) is attempting to contact people seated close to the case. The service is checking whether these passengers are susceptible to measles infection, and offering advice which includes further immunisation, or possibly isolation to avoid spreading the disease.

"Although passengers in rows 31 -- 49 are most exposed, there's a possibility of anyone on the flight, around the flight gate or baggage claim at this time, could have been infected. It is very easily transmitted from one person to another, possibly just from walking past the passenger with measles, or while sitting near them in the airport gate lounge," says Dr Hale. Measles is a serious illness. One in 10 people with measles need hospital treatment and the most serious cases can result in deafness or swelling of the brain. Dr Hale says measles is infectious before the rash appears and is one of the most infectious airborne diseases. "The only way to protect from measles and the best way to avoid its complications is to be fully vaccinated. Anyone born before 1969 is likely to be immune to the disease without having had the vaccine."
