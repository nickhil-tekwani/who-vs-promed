The Ministry of Health (MINSA) in Los Santos province this morning [Fri 20 Oct 2017] confirmed that a 10-year-old child who was moved, was positive for [a] hantavirus [infection].

The epidemiologist Carlos Muñoz stated that this child from Las Tablas Abajo, was admitted to the Joaquin Pablo Franco hospital with a sickle cell-like presentation this past [Tue 17 Oct 2017], but since he did not recover and because his platelets declined, a hantavirus test was done.

Muñoz stated the he was 1st moved to the Pediatric Specialties Hospital in Panama City for his sickle cell problem, but the pediatrician ordered the [hantavirus] test and later was informed that the hantavirus test was positive for this fever.

"Up to this [Fri 20 Oct 2017] morning, the child was in stable condition, starting with fever, but we must wait because sometimes it starts with fever and ends up with [hantavirus cardiopulmonary] syndrome, so we hope that will not be in this case," Muñoz expressed.

This is hantavirus [infection] case number 19 [this year: 2017].

[The situation under which the child acquired the infection is not mentioned, nor is there an indication if the Ministry of Health or provincial health authorities have, or will, mount an epidemiological investigation in the area where the child acquired the infection.

There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in this or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments in previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
