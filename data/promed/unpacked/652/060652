Newcastle Disease in Australia - Suspicion
-------------------------------------------
Emergency report

Information received on 10 May 2002 from Dr Gardner Murray, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Australia (AFFA), Canberra:

Report date: 10 May 2002.

A suspected case of Newcastle disease in a poultry layer farm near the town
of Meredith in the western part of the State of Victoria is being
investigated.

Immediate action has been taken to place the suspected property in
quarantine, and establish movement controls and a control zone around the
suspect property. Epidemiological investigations have been instigated in
the surrounding area. Samples are being examined at the Australian Animal
Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong, Victoria.

Note: The last outbreak of Newcastle disease in Australia was reported in
February 2000.

Suspected Newcastle Disease In Victoria
----------------------------------------
Authorities have quarantined a poultry farm west of Melbourne after the
discovery of a suspected case of Newcastle Disease. Initial tests suggest
the highly contagious viral disease is the reason for a drop in egg
production, but DNA finger-printing will be required to confirm the results.

Two years ago, an outbreak of the disease crippled one of New South Wales'
largest poultry regions. But John Galvin from the Department of Natural
Resources is hopeful the impact on the Victorian industry will not be as
serious.

"Mangrove Mountain was wall-to-wall 'chook city' ['chook' is the Australian
slang for chicken - Mod.MPP], if you like," he said. "Large concentrations
of poultry and the opportunity for spread in a localized area -- and that's
certainly not what we're dealing with here. Perhaps one of the key lessons
that we'll pick up out of the Mangrove Mountain experience is how vaccine
was used in some of the areas that weren't depopulated, and the
effectiveness of that."

[ProMED-mail is very grateful for receiving an early notification on the
suspected outbreak of Newcastle Disease (ND) in Victoria from Dr Andrew
Cupit, Senior Veterinary Officer, Office of the Chief Veterinary Officer
(CVO), Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Canberra, Australia.

Australia was declared free of ND in a notification by the Australian CVO
to the OIE dated 5 Oct 2000, following the previous outbreak which was
restricted to NSW.
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_25.HTM#Sec3>.

The notification stated:-- "it is now over six months since the slaughter of
the last affected animal on a quarantined farm and, therefore, with no
detection of clinical disease or virulent virus, NSW satisfies the
provisions of Article 2.1.15.2. of the International Animal Health Code (the
Code) for a Newcastle disease free zone with vaccination". It was further
stated that "vaccination with live V4 vaccine and killed vaccine continues
(in NSW) on a voluntary basis".

The other states and territories of Australia retained their status as free
of Newcastle disease where vaccination for Newcastle disease is not
practised, in accordance with the provisions of Article 2.1.15.2. of the
Code. The CVO concluded: "Australia is a Newcastle disease free country,
according to the provisions of Article 2.1.15.2. of the Code."

Article 2.1.15.2 "ND free country" says:

A country may be considered free from ND when it has been shown that ND has
not been present for at least the past 3 years.

This period shall be 6 months after the slaughter of the last affected
animal for countries in which a stamping-out policy is practised with or
without vaccination against ND. - Mod. AS]
