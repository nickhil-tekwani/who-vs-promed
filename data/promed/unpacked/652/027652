Russia: rabies widespread in wildlife in Kurgan region
------------------------------------------------------
An emergency has been declared in the Kurgan region. Cases of rabies among
animals have been recorded in all districts of the region. In January 2005
alone, more than 200 people bitten by sick animals have sought medical
attention. This is 30 per cent more than last year [2004]. The most
distressing case was reported from the Makushinsk District. A rottweiler
[rabid or not?] mauled and killed an 8 year old boy. Doctors are disturbed
by the fact that rabies has recently become more common in cats. Wild
animals began to show [disturbed behavior] after summer forest fires, and
hungry predators -- foxes and wolves -- in search of food began to enter
human settlements, where they came into contact with domestic pets and
transmitted rabies infection to them.
Ivan Panasenko, the head physician of the Regional Unit for Control of
Animal Disease, stated that general vaccination of pets and [bait
containing anti-rabies vaccine] had shown little effect this winter [2005].
Rabies diagnostics are carried out in the Virology Laboratory in Rjabkovo.
In January [2005], about 40 samples from foxes, dogs, horses, and cows were
submitted to the laboratory for examination. The samples from dogs were
rabies positive. As a consequence, hunters have been authorized to shoot
wild animals of the canine family.

A hunter died from rabies in Dubna (Moscow region)
--------------------------------------------------
A 29 year old man from Dubna turned to medical care, having developed
hydrophobia, when it was too late to do prophylactic vaccination, and on
the fifth day of hospitalization he died. He had been finishing the carcass
of an animal a month before his symptoms appeared. When the man was
examined later, physicians found no visible skin damages. But this does not
exclude the case that he might have had cuts when he was skinning the
animal. All his family members and people who were in contact with him are
prescribed to get vaccination.
