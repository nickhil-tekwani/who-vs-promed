More deaths from Ebola outbreak in Congo DR
-------------------------------------------
2 more people have died from an Ebola outbreak in central Congo DR
[Democratic Republic of the Congo], bringing the tally to 11 dead
from the highly contagious but rare disease, Medecins sans Frontieres
[MSF] told AFP on Sun 28 Dec 2008. "This Sunday morning, a woman with
symptoms... of Ebola died," MSF spokesman Francois Dumont told AFP. A
man also died from Ebola on Thursday [25 Dec 2008], he said. Health
Minister Augustin Mopipi said Thursday [25 Dec 2008] that the
outbreak had killed 9 and infected 21 since it was detected in
November [2008].

Named after a small Congo river, the disease was found in the town of
Kampungu, near Mueka in the Western Kasai [Kasai Occidental] province.
Ebola is deadly in about 50-90 percent of cases, with the most severe
cases hemmorhaging all over and bleeding from body orifices before
dying.

MSF has erected a "small isolation unit of 6 beds" near Kampungu, with
3 cases receiving care there, Dumont said; 2 others are at home and
under observation, with MSF also following more than 100 people who
have had contact with the disease, he said.

The Democratic Republic of Congo has been hit by Ebola outbreaks 3
times before. In 1976 Ebola virus killed nearly 500 people in [both
the DRC & the Sudan]. It struck again in 1995, killing 245 people in
the western province of Bandundu. Another 26 cases were confirmed in
2007 in Kasai province.
