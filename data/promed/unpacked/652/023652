West Virginia urges testing after hepatitis B outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
Nearly 2000 people in 5 states and Washington, D.C., were urged to
get hepatitis B tests after patients and volunteers at a free dental
clinic in West Virginia contracted the blood-borne disease, public
health officials said Friday [4 Jun 2010].

Officials say the risk of widespread illness is low, but they are
concerned that low-income people who can't afford medical care may
not know they are sick and could pass the disease to others. "The
problem comes if there has been unrecognized transmission and someone
is chronically infected," said Danae Bixler, with the West Virginia
Bureau of Public Health. "They need to know that."

Letters recommending testing are being mailed to 1137 patients who
received care at the Mission of Mercy Dental Clinic in Berkeley
County in June 2009, according to the agency. Another 826 volunteers
are getting similar letters. Most are going to West Virginians, but
people from Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and
North Carolina also are being told to get tested.

The majority of the patients and volunteers are from West Virginia,
but the 2-day Eastern Panhandle event attracted participants from
neighboring states. A total of 3 patients and 2 volunteers developed
acute hepatitis B in November [2009]. While the agency says it's not
certain they caught the disease at the clinic, tests show 4 were
probably infected by the same source.

About 90 percent of people who get hepatitis B [virus infection]
recover, but 10 percent get a chronic form of the disease that can
[ultimately] cause liver damage. The state of West Virginia is
expected to pay for the bulk of the testing, including for people who
have health insurance, said Berkeley County Health Officer Diana
Gaviria.

[The nature and the precise period of exposure to hepatitis B virus
infection are not disclosed in this report. Further information
regarding the route of transmission would be appreciated.

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause
both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through
contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person --
not through casual contact. Hepatitis B virus can cause an acute
illness with symptoms that last several weeks, including yellowing of
the skin and eyes (jaundice), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea,
vomiting and abdominal pain. People can take several months to a year
to recover from the symptoms. Hepatitis B virus infection can also
cause a chronic liver infection that can later develop into cirrhosis
of the liver or liver cancer.

Hepatitis B virus infection is an important occupational hazard for
health workers. Fortunately, however, hepatitis B is preventable with
a safe and effective vaccine.
