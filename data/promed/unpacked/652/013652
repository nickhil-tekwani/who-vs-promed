State animal health officials today announced that a beef cow from an
Antrim County herd, which had originated from the state's known
TB-affected area of Presque Isle County, has been confirmed as bovine
TB-positive. According to Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA)
State Veterinarian Dr. Joan Arnoldi, the movement of the animal was
legal, as the Presque Isle County herd had gone through 2 annual
whole-herd tests before the producer received a permit to move. Both
herds have been quarantined and animal movement in and out of the
herds will be traced.
"While this discovery presents an initial challenge to the state and
area producers, we expect after traces are complete that we [will]
not have a risk of bovine TB in Antrim County due to the aggressive
testing and surveillance that has been conducted to date," Arnoldi
said. "We will also be implementing various testing requirements, per
our detailed protocol, in the area to ensure appropriate follow-up
and [to make sure] that we do not have the disease anywhere else in
the County." Arnoldi also said that she does not expect this to delay
or affect the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) decision on
split-state status for Michigan. Antrim County falls into the "blue
area" or transition zone on the Michigan zonal map, which requires 2
whole-herd tests before the end of 2003. The Antrim County herd was
undergoing its final required test and the cow was tagged with
electronic identification, which made it very easy to trace.
"The comprehensive and aggressive TB eradication program, complete
with stringent identification, testing, and movement requirements for
each of Michigan's TB zones, which we have put into place, is
specifically designed to detect and address circumstances like this,"
Arnoldi added.
Epidemiologists will be conducting on-farm visits to look at
everything from farm biosecurity measures and potential wildlife
incursions to animal husbandry practices and purchase and sale
records in efforts to identify TB transmission and to prevent
recurrence.
Since testing efforts began, MDA has tested nearly 900 000 cattle,
goats, bison, and privately owned cervids to date, with 30 herds
diagnosed as TB-positive. The Michigan Department of Natural
Resources (DNR) has examined 105 935 free-ranging white-tailed deer
for the disease, with 449 of those examined being identified as
TB-positive.
The state's Bovine TB Eradication Project is a multi-agency team of
experts from the MDA, Community Health, and Natural Resources,
Michigan State University, and the USDA. It continues to work
collaboratively with input from the agriculture industry and local
communities to eradicate the disease from Michigan.

[_Mycobacterium bovis_ causes cattle tuberculosis and is very similar
to 2 other bacteria, _M. avium_ and _M. paratuberculosis_. On
testing, these may cross-react. However, PCR can distinguish between
them.
Bovine TB spreads among animals when they are closely commingled.
Coughing releases the bacteria into the air, possibly infecting
animals housed in the same building, or eating next to the one
coughing. Human tuberculosis is caused by a different bacterium, _M.
tuberculosis_, although _M. bovis_ can also infect humans. Milk
pasteurization kills the TB-causing bacteria. When pasteurization
standards were developed in the 1920's, _M. bovis_ and _M.
tuberculosis_ were considered the most resistant pathogens. - Mod.TG]
