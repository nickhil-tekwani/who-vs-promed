Second Case of Suspected Hemorrhagic Fever in Nyeri
---------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: Kenya's Ministry of Health has put in place emergency measures
following the hospitalization of a second patient suspected to be suffering
from a hemorrhagic fever. A statement released here on Tue 10 Apr 2001 by
Health Minister Sam Ongeri said that a 19-year-old male recruit from
Kiganjo Police Training College had been admitted to the Mathari Mission
Hospital in the central town of Nyeri on Sun 8 Apr 2001 and was examined
the following day by a surveillance team. The patient had complained of
malaise and headache for a week before he developed diarrhoea on Mon 9 Apr
2001, the statement said, adding that he was stable and in isolation.
A 24-year-old woman with symptoms of haemorrhagic fever, also a recruit at
the Police College, died at the Consolata Mission Hospital near Nyeri on
Mon 2 Apr 2001, a day after she was admitted. Ongeri said that although
Ebola virus had been practically ruled out [as the cause of her illness,
his Ministry has not dismissed the possibility of hemorrhagic fever and has
set up isolation rooms both at Kiganjo and Mathari Mission Hospital. The
Ministry has also put in place and distributed hemorrhagic fever management
guidelines. A surveillance team consisting of experts from the Health
Ministry, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and the World
Health Organisation (WHO) [had been constituted.

Kenyan Minister of Health Discounts Possibility of Ebola Fever
--------------------------------------------------------------
Health Minister, Professor Sam Ongeri, yesterday ruled out [the possibility
of an outbreak of Ebola fever in Nyeri. Ongeri , who told the public not
to panic, stated that the 24-year-old female patient from Kiganjo Police
Training College who died had an inherited bleeding disorder. He said that
2 of her siblings had died in Homa Bay Hospital. One died 3 years ago and
the other 6 months ago with similar afflictions. "We spoke to her mother
yesterday to establish the history of the problem," said Ongeri. The
minister said the other patient, a 19-year-old male recruit at Kiganjo, is
in isolation and under surveillance.
Ongeri, who issued a ministerial statement in Parliament, stated that the
possibility of an Ebola fever outbreak at Mathari Mission Hospital and
Kiganjo Police Training College , was remote. "Although these cases are
unlikely to be the result of Ebola virus infection, the Ministry has not
dismissed the possibility of hemorrhagic fever. He said the dead woman and
the current patient could be cases of an inherited bleeding disorder,
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, related to severe malaria, [or
hemorrhagic fever. He said they have taken adequate measures to [contain
the situation, including: Barrier nursing; reservation of isolation rooms,
both in Kiganjo Police Training College and Mathari Mission Hospital; and
[circulation of hemorrhagic fever management guidelines. A surveillance
team consisting of experts from the Ministry of Health, the Kenya Medical
Research Institute (KEMRI), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) had
been constituted.
Ongeri said the second victim, aged 19 years, a male recruit at Kiganjo
admitted to the hospital on 8 April 2001, is under surveillance. "The
surveillance teams examined him on Mon 9 Apr 2001 and his specimens are
being processed," said Ongeri. The minister said the patient has a history
of malaise and headaches, and had developed diarrhoea on Mon 9 Apr 2001. He
is stable and in isolation. Ongeri said that [the results of diagnostic
tests would be available later in the week.
The Member of Parliament for Mathari, Matu Wamae (DP), had sought an
assurance from Prof Ongeri that Nyeri Town was free from Ebola. "I have
said and I will say again that the possibility is remote. This is because
the incubation period of Ebola hemorrhagic fever is 21 days. The lady was
admitted on 17 Feb 2001; this is outside the [incubation period of the
disease." "If it was Ebola," Ongeri said, "we would have seen more cases of
the disease emerging."
Lurambi MP Newton Kulundu (Ford Kenya) asked the Minister to consider the
possibility of yellow fever. Ongeri [replied that: "We have consigned
yellow fever to the past. If it is yellow fever it is containable."

[There seems little in common between these 2 cases, but the Ministry is
sensibly keeping its options open until the results of the diagnostic tests
become available. The 2 accounts differ regarding the date of admission of
the first patient. - Mod.CP
