[In a previous post, I asked Dr. Rory Hillocks, Natural Resources Institute
(NRI, University of Greenwich) for information on the means of transmission
of Cassava brown streak virus. His reply is given below. - Mod. DH]
"It may be too late now for your review, but yes, we have conducted
transmission experiments with CBSD in our insectaries here at the Natural
Resources Institute (NRI) [University of Greenwich]. We have shown that the
virus is transmitted between cassava plants by the whitefly _Bemisia
tabaci_. Transmission was confirmed by PCR-based diagnostics. Transmission
frequency was low for reasons that are not clear at present [M. Maruthi and
R. Hillocks, unpublished]. Regards, Rory Hillocks"

[Below is a summary of recent information on Cassava brown streak virus
gleaned from several sources.
Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) -- 1st reported in cassava, _Manihot
esculenta_, by Storey from East Africa in 1936 -- is a species in the genus
_Ipomovirus_. A devastating virus that causes cassava brown streak disease
(CBSD), it is gaining in severity, threatening food and livelihood
securities for millions of farmers and cassava consumers in Sub-Saharan
Africa. CBSD is considered the most important disease of cassava disease in
coastal East Africa, and, is also found along the shores of Lake Malawi in
Malawi and Tanzania. In Tanzania, the rate of infection of CBSD ranges up
from 2 - 83 percent, depending on cultivar and location. The peak period of
disease spread occurs in cassava planted in April and May, and this
correlates very well with peak populations of whiteflies (primarily
_Bemisia tabaci_), confirming that it is indeed the vector. A recently
developed RT-PCR assay can detect CBSV in symptomless germplasm and
planting material with good success. Interspecific crosses between
domesticated cassava and the wild _Manihot melanobasis_ at the Amani
research station in Tanzania have resulted in good levels of resistance to
CBSV. Local tolerant cultivars in southern Tanzania and Mozambique are also
of use in disease management.
I sincerely thank Dr. Rory Hillocks for providing his comments on
transmission of CBSV by Bt.
