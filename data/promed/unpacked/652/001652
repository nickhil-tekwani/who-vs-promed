Human anthrax in India may be linked to the decline of vultures. Wildlife
scientists in India suspect that a reported resurgence in anthrax among
humans in some parts of the country may be linked to a sharp, unprecedented
drop in India's population of vultures. Government epidemiologists say,
however, that no evidence exists yet for such a link.
Animal anthrax remains endemic in India because inadequate vaccination and
lack of cooperation from farmers has kept livestock susceptible to the
infection. But the incidence of human anthrax is now rising, doctors
reported at the annual conference of the Association of Physicians of India
in New Delhi. Last year [2000] wildlife scientists issued an alert that an
unprecedented decline in the population of vultures across India [might]
lead to the spread of zoonotic diseases from livestock to people. India has
lost nearly 90 per cent of its vultures to an illness that wildlife
researchers suspect is caused by an avian virus.
India lacks facilities for incineration and for sophisticated carcass
processing, so slaughterhouse waste and dead livestock from farms have
traditionally been dumped on the edge of towns and cities. "India relies
extensively on vultures for clean-up," said Dr Vibhu Prakash, principal
scientist with the Bombay Natural History Society. "With vultures here
headed for extinction, India is losing its most efficient scavenger," he
said. Government epidemiologists, however, say that a more efficient
disease tracking system may be responsible for the rise in the number of
reported cases. "There is no evidence that the increase has resulted from
the death of vultures," said Dr Udai Rana, deputy director at the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases.

_Gyps_ genus vultures have almost disappeared all over India, apparently
from a viral disease, origin unknown. Massive expansion [of the] Indian
poultry industry in recent years is a potential source of novel avian
viruses [for vultures]. Indian scientists say the lack of vultures is
already leading to increases in packs of semi-feral dogs around villages,
as they have plenty of meat to eat, and a rise in rabies cases is feared.
If that has already happened (this has been going on for some 5 years or
so) surely the anthrax exposure risk should have increased visibly by now
too, as presumably some of these uneaten carcasses died of anthrax. Note:
the disease appears to be spreading - in the direction of Afghanistan. What
other zoonoses might follow from a near-total loss of the major scavenger?
Some infections in particular might be likely to arise directly from
handling carcasses, presumably. And there must be some secondary knock-ons
other than rabies from the rise in the dog population too.

[Like the Indian commentator, Dr Udai Rana, I am doubtful whether the loss
of vultures has had such a marked direct impact in the livestock anthrax
incidence as Mudur claims. However the efficient and rapid disposal of
anthrax carcasses is a key component of anthrax control and, if one cannot
burn or bury, vultures are seen as a preferred scavenger over dogs, wolves,
foxes, and such. The present human cases in India show that human
scavenging is an ongoing public health problem. But the larger question is
of great interest: what are the veterinary and public health impacts in
India of losing vultures? An increase in rabies increase has been
suggested. Certain parasite infections, especially tapeworms, might be
expected to increase. Environmental contamination? Will the non-consumption
of Parsee corpses have an impact?* Something to consider over the weekend.
