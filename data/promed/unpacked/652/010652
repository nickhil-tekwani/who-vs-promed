Abstract
--------
In Nigeria, before 2017 the most recent case of human monkeypox had been reported in 1978. By mid-November 2017, a large outbreak caused by the West African clade resulted in 146 suspected cases and 42 laboratory-confirmed cases from 14 states. Although the source is unknown, multiple sources are suspected.

[Selected summary]
------------------
On [13 Oct 2017], the Nigeria CDC received laboratory confirmation of a human monkeypox outbreak in Nigeria. As of [17 Nov 2017], a total of 146 suspected cases had been reported from 22 of the 36 states in Nigeria (Figure [see URL]). Of the 134 samples (blood, lesion swab, and crust) collected during the reporting period, 107 samples were tested, and 42 samples from 14 states were laboratory confirmed as the West African clade of the monkeypox virus. Most (62 percent) of the laboratory-confirmed cases were in adults (21-40 years of age; median 30 years of age); the male:female ratio was 2:1. A 46-year-old male patient with confirmed monkeypox and a history of immunosuppressive illness died. For some patients with suspected (but ultimately deemed negative) cases of monkeypox, chickenpox (wild-type virus) was confirmed. Further analysis of the monkeypox-negative samples is ongoing.

Although detailed epidemiologic investigations to ascertain the source and route of transmission are ongoing, 3 family clusters were found, which might suggest some level of human-to-human transmission in this outbreak. For 1 of the families, the secondary attack rate was 71 percent. However, most patients had no obvious epidemiologic linkage or person-to-person contact, indicating a probable multiple-source outbreak or possibly previously unrecognized endemic disease. The zoonotic source(s) of the outbreak are currently unknown, and it is unclear what, if any, environmental or ecologic changes might have facilitated its sudden reemergence.

[This report provides a good summary of the recent monkeypox (MPX) outbreak in Nigeria. It substantiates the West African clade of MPX virus as the one involved, which explains the low (almost nil) case fatality rate compared to the Central African clade. The 3 family clusters indicate that person-to-person transmission can occur, but does not account for the origin of the majority of cases. The role of rodents as reservoirs and sources of human exposure in this outbreak are unknown.

A previous report indicated that the MPXV of the index case was acquired within the country. With no cross-state relationships of cases and preliminary genetic sequencing, that suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into human population. One wonders if a MPXV epizootic has been going on in rodent hosts across a relatively wide geographic area in the country. Studies of prevalence of MPXV in rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_).
