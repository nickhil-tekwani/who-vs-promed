CVM announces the availability of the NARMS 2007 executive report
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM)
announced today [4 May 2010] the availability of the National Antimicrobial
Resistance Monitoring Systems' Enteric Bacteria (NARMS) 2007 Executive Report.

The report summarizes, in an integrated format, NARMS data on non-typhoidal
_Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_ isolates recovered in 2007 from food
animals at federally inspected plants, retail meats, and humans. The report
also includes susceptibility data on _Escherichia coli_ isolates recovered
from retail meats and chickens. Summary data from prior years are also
included.

As a supplement to the report, CVM has also provided 2 interactive graphs.
The graphs allow users to visualize trends in antimicrobial resistance
among NARMS _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_ isolates through a
user-friendly interface.

The report may be found at
<http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/SafetyHealth/AntimicrobialResistance/NationalAntimicrobialResistanceMonitoringSystem/ucm209340.htm>.

[Currently the issue of antimicrobial resistance is a hot topic in both
human and veterinary medicine. Sadly, this is already 3 years old, but it
is the most recent assessment of NARMS. - Mod.TG]
