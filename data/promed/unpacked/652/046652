Health officials in the region said the incidence of dengue cases had
reached "alarming proportions," citing the rising number of victims
admitted to hospitals.
Emeliano "Jun" Galvan, information officer of the Department of
Health (DOH) 10, said the number of dengue cases had risen to such a
level that DOH was calling for local government units (LGUs) to
coordinate with their office.
DOH records showed that from January to May 2005, at least 1000
persons had been afflicted with dengue, and 32 had died. "The number
of dengue cases has tripled this year [2005]," Galvan said.
4 of 5 provinces in Region 10 have been severely affected by the
disease, including Misamis Oriental, Cagayan de Oro, where there were
807 victims. There were 182 victims in Bukidnon province, 170 victims
in Lanao del Norte and 85 victims in Camiguin province.
In Misamis Oriental, the affected areas are Gingoog City with 38
cases, 36 cases in Tagoloan town, 34 cases in El Salvador town, 30 in
Opol town, 23 in Villanueva town, 23 in Medina town, 14 in
Balingasag, 13 in Lagonglong, 11 in Claveria town and one case in
every municipality in the province.
Galvan said there are 479 cases in Cagayan de Oro, with 5 deaths. The DOH 10
said it would inspect the barangays [districts] in the city to determine the
final figures.
The DOH 10 had conducted a nationwide campaign in order to diminish the number
of dengue cases and the presence of dengue-carrying mosquitoes. The regional
health authorities said there are no other solutions other than cleaning up
one's surroundings. Galvan said communities should eliminate all possible
breeding places for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes, especially those containing
water where the mosquitoes lay their eggs. Galvan said people should replace
the water in flower vases each day at 4 p.m., otherwise known as the 4 o' clock
habit. People are also advised to plant bromeliads, since the plants can absorb
rainwater quickly [In contrast, in Brazil homeowners are advised to tear out
the bromeliads from their gardens exactly because they provide mosquito
breeding sites. - Mod.JW].
One of the symptoms of dengue is continued fever. Galvan urged
families to bring their children who display these symptoms to the
hospital immediately.
On Friday [3 Jun 2005], the Provincial Health Office launched its
"sumpo lamok" program in order to reduce the incidence of malaria and
dengue cases.

Viet Nam's southern Mekong Delta has had over 6700 cases of dengue
fever, including 3 fatalities, for the 1st 5 months in 2005, the
local health authority reported recently.
The provinces of Soc Trang and Dong Thap reported the highest number
of cases, at about 1000 each. Meanwhile, the number of dengue fever
patients is increasing in An Giang and Ben Tre. Doctors from the
Preventive Health Care Center also predicted vicious outbreaks of
dengue fever in local provinces, as the rainy season has begun.

Thailand's health ministry is on a high alert for the start of the
dengue fever season next month [July 2005]. It has stepped up its
surveillance for the disease throughout the country. In southern
Thailand, an average of more than 16 percent of the population is
reportedly suffering from dengue fever, according to the director of
the local disease prevention office, Dr. Boonchai Poomborplab.
The highest incidence of the disease is in Songkhla, where there are
181 dengue fever patients, followed by Trang with 164 cases, and
Pattalung with 103 cases. As a percentage of the population, Satun,
Trang and Pattalung have the highest incidence of dengue fever cases.
However, there have been no reported deaths from the disease in any
of the southern provinces so far, after a 13-year-old boy in Bangkok
died of dengue shock syndrome last month [May 2005]. Although the
figure of dengue patients is still relatively low, the health
ministry plans to keep a close eye on the disease, particularly in
the provinces where the highest numbers of patients have been
recorded.
The 3 southernmost provinces will also be kept under strict
surveillance despite the low rates of dengue cases. But, it is still
possible that there will be a widespread outbreak in August and
September 2005, Dr. Boonchai said.
Provincial health offices have already fully established preventive
and disease control measures, he added.

[According to the official surveillance, there have been more than
8000 reported dengue fever cases in Thailand since the beginning of
2005. 16 people have died. The number of patients and deaths is
expected to increase, especially during rainy season in June-August
2005. During 2004, 38 000 people contracted the mosquito-borne
disease, and 40 died, most in the 10-14 year age group. An average of
16 percent of the population in the 3 southernmost provinces has
suffered from dengue fever this year [2005]. - Mod.RY]
[It is striking that the death rate in the Philippines in the report above was
approx. 320/10 000, in the report from Viet Nam it was only 4.5/10 000, almost
100 times lower, and in Thailand in 2004 it was 10/10 000. Does anyone have an
explanation? Perhaps the reporting system for dengue in the Philippines is
different. - Mod.JW]
