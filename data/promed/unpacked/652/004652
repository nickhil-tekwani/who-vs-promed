A deadly [disease] called Alabama Rot which can kill dogs is spreading across the UK, including Greater Manchester.

As reported in the MEN in April 2016, a landlady urged dog owners to stay away from woodland near Wigan, after her pet contracted Alabama Rot and had to be put down.

A total of 78 dogs have been confirmed with the disease since 2012, with 14 in the 1st 4 months of 2016.

London, Monmouthshire, West Sussex and Surrey have seen 2 confirmed cases [each] this year [2016], while Cheshire, Greater Manchester Lancashire, Wiltshire, East Sussex and Wrexham have all had one confirmed.

Since 2012, there have been 12 cases in Greater Manchester. Signs warning dog owners of the disease have gone up around the Wigan and Salford border in countryside around Boothstown and Astley.

The mysterious illness, which 1st appeared in the late 1980s affecting greyhounds in America, has been found in at least 27 counties in England and Wales since 2012.

"The cause of Alabama Rot, clinically known as idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), is still unknown, and there is no known way to prevent a dog from contracting the disease," said David Walker, from Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists.

"While there is currently no known way to prevent a dog from contracting the disease, there is a very useful guide available online to help people understand where in the UK confirmed cases have been found and advice on how to spot signs.

To help collate correct data for dog owners, Anderson Moores is calling for all UK vets to contact them if they see a dog they suspect has Alabama Rot.

"Only tests on a kidney from an affected dog, most likely post mortem, will give 100 percent confirmation of the disease," added David.

"There have been a number of cases 'confirmed' by vets, but unless we carry out analysis of the affected pet, we will never be able to confirm the disease."

Vets4Pets, which has nearly 400 practices across the UK, is supporting the research work.

"The concern among vets in the UK is that, unlike the Alabama Rot that affected greyhounds in America, the disease in the UK does not seem to target any specific breed, age, sex or weight of dog," said Dr Huw Stacey, director of clinical services at Vets4Pets.

"Treatment is supportive but is only successful in 20-30% of cases, which is why we're encouraging all dog owners to use the online interactive guide to help them understand the clinical signs and confirmed locations of Alabama Rot.

"The 1st sign that is normally seen is a skin sore that isn't caused by a known injury. Most commonly, these sores are found below the elbow or knee and appear as a distinct swelling, a patch of red skin, or are open and ulcer-like.

"Any dog owners who are worried that their pet might have Alabama Rot should contact their veterinary practice immediately."

[Similar cases in dogs from various locations in England, some of them referred to as the "New Forest Disease," have been addressed by ProMED-mail in several postings since September 2011, referred to as "undiagnosed." In April 2015, a team of 9 authors, consisting of 6 British and 3 Americans, published the results of their common investigations (Ref 1), leading them to believe that the disease is cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV or Alabama rot), a condition which has been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years. While there have been occasional reports of the disease in individual dogs outside of the USA, this scientific report covered for the 1st time a series of cases occurring in England. None of the 30 dogs in this English series of cases were greyhounds, and evidence of the disease was found in 15 different breeds of dog. (For further details, please refer to 20160503.4199781 and to Ref 1).

In a recent (January 2016) letter to the Veterinary Record (Ref 2), the authors addressed the need for an early decision if an erosive or ulcerative skin lesion of unknown cause is the result of CRGV or of a different cause, as azotaemia [abnormally high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as urea, creatinine, various body waste compounds, and other nitrogen-rich compounds) in the blood] is typically absent at initial presentation, and urine-concentrating ability may be retained. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement may allow early detection of pre-azotaemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and thus direct appropriate management. Veterinary surgeons presented with a dog with skin lesion(s) of unknown cause were invited to contact <medicine@andersonmoores.com> (phone 01962 767920) to discuss GFR measurement. "Samples can be collected in their practices, and laboratory testing will be performed at the Royal Veterinary College; results will be available within 24 hours, thus aiding clinical decision making. Aside from blood sampling, all costs will be covered."
