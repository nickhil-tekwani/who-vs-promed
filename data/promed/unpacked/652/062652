Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (also known as Viral Hemorrhagic Disease of
Rabbits) [caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, a calicivirus was
confirmed in a group of 27 rabbits in Crawford County, Iowa. As of April
6th, 25 of 27 rabbits had died and the remaining 2 were euthanized on April
8th. The rabbits were Palominos and California Whites. The premises is
quarantined and the disease appears to be contained on the premises.
The first rabbit, one allowed to roam near the house, died on 9 Mar 2000.
Rabbits housed in hutches started dying on 16 Mar 2000.
The source of infection has not been determined. There have been no
introductions of rabbits onto the premises in the last 2 years. August 1999
was the last time rabbits left the farm and returned. In January 2000, six
rabbits, all healthy and greater than 2 months old, were sold. There are no
known premises with rabbits in the near vicinity. Veterinary Services and
the Iowa Department Agriculture and Land Stewardship are continuing the
investigation.
A private veterinarian forwarded samples to Iowa State University
Diagnostic Laboratory on 22 Mar 2000. Microscopic examination revealed
severe acute periportal hepatic necrosis and hemorrhage, pulmonary edema,
and fibrinous thrombi in renal glomeruli. Rabbit calicivirus or toxic
hepatopathy was suspected based on the clinical history and microscopic
lesions. Cultures for _Pasteurella multocida_ and other bacteria were
negative. A mycotoxin screen of the feed was negative.
On 24 Mar 2000, a second rabbit was submitted with similar lesions. The
state and federal officials were notified on 27 Mar 2000, and a foreign
animal disease investigation began immediately. Epidemiologic information
was collected and samples were sent to the USDAs Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL). FADDL suspected rabbit calicivirus disease
based on hemagglutination (HA) tests and electron microscopy. FADDL
forwarded samples to Spain for confirmation; the laboratory in Spain
further confirmed the diagnosis by polymerase chain reaction assay.
Rabbit calicivirus was first reported in 1984 in the Peoples Republic of
China. From 1985-1986 it spread through the domestic and wild rabbit
populations in continental Europe. The first report of the virus in the
Western Hemisphere was in Mexico City in 1988. Mexico was successful in
eradicating the virus by 1992. Recent outbreaks of rabbit calicivirus
disease have occurred in Australia (1995), New Zealand (1997) and Cuba
(1997). In 1995, as a result of a laboratory accident in southern
Australia, the virus escaped and killed 10 million rabbits in 8 weeks.
Rabbit Calicivirus Disease is a disease of the European rabbit
(_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). This is the species from which all U.S. domestic
and commercial rabbits are derived. Rabbits native to North America
(cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits) do not develop clinical disease and
are not susceptible to rabbit calicivirus.
Humans and other mammals are not infected by the rabbit calicivirus.
Rabbit calicivirus is a highly contagious virus transmitted by direct
contact with infected rabbits or indirectly by contact with objects
contaminated with virus. Morbidity is often near 100% and mortality 60-90%.
Infection results in a peracute febrile disease of domestic rabbits causing
hepatic necrosis, enteritis, and lymphoid necrosis followed by massive
coagulopathy resulting in hemorrhages in a variety of organs. Rabbits die
acutely within 6 to 24 hours of the onset of a fever with few clinical signs.
