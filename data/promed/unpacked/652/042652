The service of epidemiology and prevention of the Directorate General for Public Health of the Canary Islands government is investigating the emergence of 10 cases of people who may have ciguatera poisoning related to fish consumption in San Bartolome.

None of those affected by this outbreak required hospital admission, but some were treated in emergency services. The cases had digestive symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain and, subsequently, paresthesia, paradoxical sensations and muscle aches.

The presence of fish containing the ciguatera toxin has a greater impact on the islands of Lanzarote and Fuerteventura where larger reef fish can be caught.

Ciguatera is found in tropical and subtropical seas, in areas of coral reefs. Ciguatera poisoning can occur after the ingestion of any of the more than 400 species of fish in the tropical reefs, where plankton may produce ciguatoxin, accumulating in the flesh of the marine animal.

The larger, older fish are more toxic. The flavor of the fish is not altered, and there is no known method of freezing or cooking them that protects from poisoning. Symptoms appear from one to several hours after ingestion. The characteristic illness lasts about 8 days in most cases.

[Lanzarote, a Spanish island (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanzarote) is the easternmost of the autonomous Canary Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean, about 125 km (78 miles) off the coast of Africa and 1000 km (621 miles) from the Iberian Peninsula. It is the 4th largest of the islands. The 1st recorded name for the island, given by Angelino Dulcert, was Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus, after the Genoese navigator Lancelotto Malocello, from which the modern name is derived.

The following is taken from CDC: Cluster of ciguatera fish poisoning -- North Carolina, 2007. MMWR 2009; 58: 283-5
(http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5811a3.htm; edited; original citation numbering retained):

"Ciguatoxins are lipid-soluble cyclic polyether compounds and are the most potent sodium channel toxins known (3). Carnivorous tropical and semitropical fish, such as barracuda, amberjack, red snapper, and grouper, become contaminated with ciguatoxins by feeding on plant-eating fish that have ingested _Gambierdiscus toxicus_ or another member of the _Gambierdiscus_ genus, a group of large dinoflagellates commonly found in coral reef waters (4). Gambiertoxins from _Gambierdiscus_ spp. are converted into more potent lipid-soluble ciguatoxins. Spoilage of fish that have been caught is not a factor in toxin development, and cooking does not deactivate the toxin. Humans who eat contaminated predatory fish are exposed to variable concentrations of ciguatoxin, depending on the fish size, age, and part consumed (toxins concentrate more in the viscera, especially liver, spleen, gonads, and roe). The attack rate can be as high as 80 to 90 per cent in persons who eat affected fish, depending on the amount of toxin in the fish.

"Persistence or recurrence of neurologic symptoms are hallmarks of CFP [ciguatera fish poisoning]. Three of the 9 patients in this cluster had recurrences of one or more symptoms for more than 6 months after their initial illness. If these patients are again exposed to fish (either ciguatoxin-contaminated or even non-contaminated fish), their symptoms likely will be more severe than those experienced with their initial episodes of CFP (3).

"Variations in the geographic distribution of the various ciguatoxins might explain regional differences in symptom patterns. CFP symptoms associated with eating fish from the Pacific Ocean are primarily neurologic, and symptoms associated with eating fish from the Caribbean Sea are more commonly gastrointestinal (4). Amberjack often is linked to CFP cases in the Caribbean. Although the amberjack fish responsible for this cluster of CFP cases tested positive for C-CTX-1, it was not tested for the presence of other ciguatoxins, which also might have been present and could have altered disease presentation (7).

"CFP has been associated almost exclusively with eating fish caught in tropical or semitropical waters, but increased global marketing of these species has increased the possibility that persons in temperate zones might become ill with CFP (4). Moreover, warming seawaters might expand the ranges of ciguatoxin-contaminated fish (8). In the USA, such fish have been found as far north as the coastal waters of North Carolina. Despite underreporting, CFP now is considered one of the most common illnesses related to fish consumption in the USA (9).

"Any level of Caribbean ciguatoxin 0.1 ppb [parts per billion] or more of fish tissue is thought to pose a health risk (3). As this illness becomes more common in nontropical areas of the world, clinicians need to be aware of its manifestations and how to manage it. Although opinions vary on the most effective course of treatment, intravenous mannitol has been a mainstay of management of neurologic symptoms for more than 20 years. Early mannitol treatment is considered more effective, but anecdotal evidence suggests that even delayed therapy benefits some patients. Amitriptyline also has been useful in relieving some of the neurologic symptoms of CFP (10). If evaluating a possible case, clinicians should consult their local poison control center for the latest treatment guidelines.
