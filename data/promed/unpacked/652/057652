Public health officials have confirmed Coconino County's 2nd case of hantavirus this year [2016]. They say the person has recovered from the illness.

In January [2016], another Coconino County resident died from complications of the hantavirus (See ProMED-mail archive no. 20160114.3936962). The Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation said that person was a resident of the Navajo Nation, but no other identifying information was released.

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus is transmitted to people who come into contact with or breathe infected urine, droppings or saliva of wild mice, primarily deer mice. It is not spread from person to person The illness starts with a fever, headache and muscle aches, and progresses rapidly to severe difficulty in breathing.

Health officials say 16 people in Arizona have died of hantavirus complications since January 2006; 2 of those deaths were in Coconino County.

[This is the 5th case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Cococino county since 2006. The earlier case in 2016 mentioned above was a resident of the Navajo (indigenous) Nation, who lived in the east central part of Coconino County [Arizona], and was the 2nd case to die of complications of HPS in Cococino county since 2006.

The hantavirus responsible for this and previous cases was not specified but undoubtedly was Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) there. Although cases of Sin Nombre virus infection are relatively rare, they can be very serious.

The comment by Joseph Dudley in the post of 15 Jan 2016 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160116.3942572) provided a timely alert for the risk of increased numbers of Sin Nombre hantavirus infections in the near future, especially for people living in the Southwest USA. El Nino recently has brought significant amounts of rain and snow to many areas. This will bring about a marked increase in vegetation in the spring and summer and is likely to increase the amount of food available for deer mice, the rodent reservoir of Sin Nombre virus. Populations of deer mice can be expected to increase, and more infected rodents are likely to enter homes, cabins and other buildings where people can be exposed to virus-contaminated excreta from these rodents. Sin Nombre virus infections can result in hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, with a case fatality rate of over 30 per cent.
