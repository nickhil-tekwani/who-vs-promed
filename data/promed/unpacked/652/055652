Abstract
--------
Background: As of 26 Mar 2021, the Africa CDC had reported 4 159 055 cases of COVID-19 and 111 357 deaths among the 55 African Union Member States; however, no country has published a nationally representative serosurvey as of May 2021. Such data are vital for understanding the pandemic's progression on the continent, evaluating containment measures, and policy planning.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, nationally representative, age-stratified serosurvey in Sierra Leone in March 2021 by randomly selecting 120 Enumeration Areas throughout the country and 10 randomly selected households in each of these. One to 2 persons per selected household were interviewed to collect information on socio-demographics, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, exposure history to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and history of COVID-19 illness. Capillary blood was collected by fingerstick, and blood samples were tested using the Hangzhou Biotest Biotech RightSign COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. Total seroprevalence was estimated after applying sampling weights.

Findings: The overall weighted seroprevalence was 2.6% (95% CI 1.9-3.4). This is 43 times higher than the reported number of cases. Rural seropositivity was 1.8% (95% CI 1.0-2.5), and urban seropositivity was 4.2% (95% CI 2.6-5.7).

Interpretation: Although overall seroprevalence was low compared to countries in Europe and the Americas (suggesting relatively successful containment in Sierra Leone), our findings indicate enormous underreporting of active cases. This has ramifications for the country's 3rd wave (which started in June 2021), where the average number of daily reported cases was 87 by the end of the month -- this could potentially be on the order of 3700 actual infections, calling for stronger containment measures in a country with only 0.2% of people fully vaccinated. It may also reflect significant underreporting of incidence and mortality across the continent.

[B] Africa cases surging
Date: Thu 8 Jul 2021

Africa has just had its "worst pandemic week ever," the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday [8 Jul 2021]. The continent is short of vaccines, and the virus is sickening its young people and overwhelming its already fragile healthcare systems.

More than 251 000 new cases were reported in Africa in the week ending 4 Jul 2021, a 20% increase from the previous week, according to Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa. For several weeks now, the continent has been experiencing a brutal wave of infections driven by the more contagious Delta variant, which is increasing hospitalization and fatalities, filling intensive-care beds, depleting oxygen supplies and pushing governments to institute new lockdown measures.

Sixteen African countries are reporting a resurgence in infections, with Malawi and Senegal added to the list this week. New case counts are doubling every 18 days, Dr. Moeti said, and have been rising for 7 straight weeks.

"A few weeks ago, we projected this milestone would be reached shortly, and it brings me no joy to be right," Dr. Moeti said at a news conference on Thursday [8 Jul 2021]. "For Africa, the worst is yet to come," she warned, adding, "The end to this precipitous rise is still weeks away."

A 3rd wave of the pandemic is ripping through countries mainly in southern and eastern Africa, and one country in North Africa -- Tunisia -- is experiencing its 4th wave. Namibia, a nation of just over 2.5 million people, has been recording more than 1000 new cases a day, and several senior government officials have succumbed to the virus. A spike in cases in Zambia has pushed the government to restrict social gatherings and close schools.

In Uganda, which was praised for its initial coronavirus response, hospitals have been stretched thin, with some patients racking up huge medical bills. Rwanda restricted movement in its capital late last month [June 2021], and Kenya instituted partial lockdowns and extended curfew hours in over a dozen counties where the Delta variant was contributing to surges.

Many African countries continue to face challenges in detecting and sequencing virus variants, Dr. Moeti said. Testing and tracing remain limited as well: In a continent of 1.3 billion people, just over 54 million COVID-19 tests have been conducted, according to Dr. John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa CDC.

But the biggest challenge has been vaccination. With just over 53 million doses administered, only about one percent of Africa's population is fully vaccinated.

African officials have accused wealthy nations of hoarding vaccine doses while millions of Africans remain vulnerable. Most African countries are dependent on the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative, which has been severely hampered by the Indian government's decision in April [2021] to hold back doses manufactured there for domestic use and restrict exports.

As cases surge in Africa, some wealthy nations have begun donating vaccine doses to nations on the continent. And as more supplies come in, health officials are urging African countries to prepare to receive and administer the doses quickly.

"Governments and partners can do this," Dr. Moeti said, "by planning to expand vaccination sites, improving cold-chain capacities beyond capital cities, sensitizing communities to boost vaccine confidence and demand, and ensuring operational funding is ready to go when it is needed."

South Korea has reported its highest ever daily jump in new COVID-19 infections as authorities considered imposing a semi-lockdown in the capital, Seoul.

The 1275 new cases announced on Thursday [8 Jul 2021] marked the 2nd straight day above 1200 and exceeded the previous one-day record of 1240 set at the peak of the country's 3rd wave in December [2020].

More than 1000 of the infections were in the greater Seoul area, which comprises the capital, Gyeonggi Province and Incheon city. The area is home to half of South Korea's 51 million people.

Jeong Eun-kyeong, who heads the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said South Korea was "at a stage of entering the 4th wave" and warned that the worst was yet to come. If the trend continued, the number of daily new infections could cross 1400 by the end of July [2021], but if the outbreak worsened, the daily caseload could top 2000 cases, she said.

Health authorities have previously said Seoul would meet the criteria for imposing Level 4 social distancing measures with a 3-day streak of new case numbers above 389, the daily average from 1 to 8 Jul 2021. Given that the city's case numbers topped 500 in the past 2 days, that requirement could be reached with Thursday's numbers, which will be announced on Friday [9 Jul 2021].

"We continue to review preemptive responses for the metropolitan Seoul area," Son Young-rae, a health ministry official, told reporters. Under Level 4 restrictions, people are advised to stay home as much as possible, schools are closed, public meetings are restricted to 2 people and rallies or other events are banned. Nightclubs and bars would be shut while restaurants and cafes would be allowed limited seating and only take-out services after 10 pm.

Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said the government would monitor the situation throughout the week and discuss potentially imposing higher restrictions in Seoul and other regions at a coronavirus response meeting on Sunday [11 Jul 2021].

Authorities said on Wednesday [7 Jul 2021] the virus was spreading rapidly, especially among unvaccinated people in their 20s and 30s, while a growing number of highly contagious Delta variant cases raised new worries. Just 10% of the country's population of 52 million people have been fully vaccinated, while 30% have received at least one shot, the majority of them people over the age of 60.

South Korea's total COVID-19 infections stand at 164 028, with 2034 deaths.

[B] Asia Pacific: sharp rise in cases
Date: Wed 7 Jul 2021 00:22 EDT

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/07/asia-pacific-sees-sharp-rise-in-covid-infections-as-delta-strain-threatens-new-wave


Countries throughout Asia Pacific -- from South Korea to Australia -- have been hit by a rise in coronavirus infections as the Delta variant threatens a new wave of the pandemic even in a region renowned for tackling the virus with a high degree of success.

China reported 57 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for 6 Jul 2021, up from 23 cases a day earlier, the national health authority said on Wednesday [7 Jul 2021]. It was the highest daily tally of infections since 30 Jan [2021].

Fifteen of the new cases were local infections, the national health commission said in a statement. All 15 cases were located in Yunnan province in the city of Ruili, which borders Myanmar. In response, authorities locked down the city, shutting most businesses and requiring residents to stay at home.

The latest cases were discovered during mass testing of residents. The positive cases include Chinese and Myanmar nationals in the city, where there is an active cross-border trade. Authorities said they would step up border controls. Ruili previously had a COVID outbreak in March [2021] and launched a campaign to vaccinate the entire city in April.

China has relied on a tough lockdown strategy and mass testing to tamp down outbreaks, even as it has stepped up the pace of vaccinations. Central health officials have said they want to vaccinate 80% of the population.

In Australia, which has vaccinated less than 10% of its eligible population, cases continued to climb in the state of New South Wales (NSW), which is at the centre of a new outbreak. On Wednesday [7 Jul 2021], the state extended the lockdown in its capital Sydney for another week to contain the latest outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant.

The 2-week stay-home orders, which were scheduled to end Friday [9 Jul 2021], will now end on 16 Jul [2021], state premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. Twenty-seven new locally acquired cases of COVID were reported in NSW, up from 18 a day earlier, taking the total infections in the outbreak to more than 350.

The Delta variant is spreading in Thailand, too -- the country reported 54 deaths and 6519 new cases on Wednesday [7 Jul 2021]. Delta cases now account for the majority of new cases in Bangkok.

Finally, in Indonesia, a nightmarish coronavirus wave has brought hospitals to their knees, forcing desperate families to hunt for oxygen tanks to treat the sick and dying at home. Nearly 1000 Indonesian medical workers have died of COVID-19, including more than a dozen who were already fully inoculated.

On Tuesday [6 Jul 2021], Jakarta said about 10 000 concentrators -- devices that generate oxygen -- were to be shipped from nearby Singapore. Some had already been flown in on a Hercules cargo plane. The government said it was also in talks with other countries, including China.

Senior minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said the country was bracing for up to "70 000 [cases] per day at worst -- but we hope that won't happen."

[3] Research: assay sensitivity
Date: Tue 29 Jun 2021

Citation: Bekliz M, Adea K, Essaidi-Laziosi M, et al. SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic tests for emerging variants. Lancet Microbe. Epub 29 Jun 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00147-6

SARS-CoV-2 antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) provide laboratory-independent results at the point of care and are powerful tools for public health interventions. Clinical and analytical studies, published in 2021, showed SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDT detection thresholds related to the presence of infectious virus in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.

However, the majority of Ag-RDT validation studies were done before SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) or interest (VOI) emerged, with the VOCs currently outcompeting earlier lineages. To date, data on routine diagnostic performance for VOCs and VOIs are sparse. Furthermore, clinical validation studies comparing multiple VOCs in parallel are hardly feasible.

We investigated the analytical sensitivity of 9 commercially available Ag-RDTs using cultured SARS-CoV-2, comparing lineage B.1.610 (1st COVID-19 pandemic wave in Europe) with VOCs B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1, and VOI P.2.

Infectious titres and RNA copies of virus stocks grown in Vero E6 were quantified by plaque titration (for infectious titres) and RT-PCR (E gene). Isolates were tested in serial dilutions, starting with 5.44 log10 PFU/mL, except for P.1, which had a maximum titre of 4.24 log10 PFU/mL. An infectious titre of 5.44 log10 PFU/mL corresponded to 10.26, 12.11, 9.86, and 11·23 log10 RNA copies/mL for B.1.610, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.2. For P.1, the infectious titre of 4.24 log10 PFU/mL corresponded to 11.81 log10 RNA copies/mL.

Ag-RDT assays were done according to the manufacturers' instructions, with the exception that 5 mcL of virus dilution was directly added to the proprietary buffer, and then applied to the Ag-RDT in duplicates under BSL3 conditions. Results were read independently by 2 individuals. Any visible test band in the presence of a visible control band was considered as positive. Ag-RDT buffer without virus was used as negative control.

When analysing results normalised to PFU/mL, comparable or better performance to the early pandemic lineage was observed for B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and P.2 for all assays (appendix [see source URL for link to download and view]). Overall sensitivity and specificity for individual isolates varied between Ag-RDTs, with the best-performing assay positive at dilutions as low as 2.43 log10 PFU/mL and the lower-sensitive assays positive at 4.54 log10 PFU/mL. Consistently, the highest sensitivity was seen for P.1 and P.2. Although testing for analytical sensitivity with cultured virus cannot fully replace clinical data, our data provide reassuring results for the use of Ag-RDTs to diagnose VOCs. Phenotypic properties, such as a large difference in the RNA-infectious virus ratio, could hint at production of defective viral particles, and their effect on diagnostic test performance should be further investigated.

[Even though this study only compares cell culture amplified virus, it is significant in that no loss in sensitivity of the assay for variants was observed. It will be good to confirm with clinical samples next. - Mod.LK]
