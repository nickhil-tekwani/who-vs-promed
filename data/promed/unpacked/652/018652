An email sent to University students late Thursday afternoon [14 Dec 2017] stated that one undergraduate student is sick with a "probable" case of the chickenpox [varicella] virus and noted that another student is has a confirmed case of the mumps virus. According to the email, both students are expected to fully recover.

"This is not an outbreak response," says Dr Jonathan Pletcher, director of medical services at University Health Services. "We wanted to let people know so they can take extra precautions, especially if they are at higher risk," he said. Pletcher and the email noted that high-risk persons include pregnant women, immunocompromised persons, and those infected with HIV/AIDS.

According to the email, chickenpox, known for "an itchy, blister-like rash all over the body" it implies, is spread by physical contact with the virus, breathing in blister particles, or absorbing tiny saliva droplets from infected persons. Individuals who have been vaccinated against chickenpox can still get the disease, although these individuals' symptoms are normally milder than symptoms in non-vaccinated patients. Symptoms of chickenpox include those consistent with a fever or cold, which then develops into the virus's infamous rash. As the virus takes 10--21 days to display symptoms, it can be spread by an unknowingly infected individual 1-2 days before the rash initially occurs.

[...]

Princeton community members can take steps to reduce their risk of contracting either virus. "Handwashing is incredibly, incredibly important throughout the day and ideally using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Avoiding sharing cups and utensils, and anything where people are swapping spit," Pletcher said.

Reporting of a large number of chickenpox cases across the province [Punjab] even during off season has raised alarm among citizens and health mangers.

More than 120 cases of chickenpox [varicella] were reported in the province during the last month. One person lost his life in Faisalabad due to chickenpox-related complication.

Chickenpox infection normally occurs during spring. Emergence of such a large number of cases in winter (off season) has caused the Directorate General [DG] of Health Services, Punjab to approach high ups of the Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department [SH&ME] with the suggestion to take measures to control the infection and treat chickenpox patients.

In a letter written to the secretary of SH&ME, director general (health) has given district-wise data of varicella zoster infection (VZV, chickenpox) cases with suggestion of case management as per recommendations of WHO. The DG also said that sufficient stock of vaccines was available in all districts.

The highest number of chickenpox has been reported in Muzaffargarh (41) followed by Attock (37) this winter [2017]. 5 chickenpox cases have been reported in the provincial metropolis.

Doctors say fatalities are rare in chickenpox cases. Timely diagnosis and early treatment is vital to save lives. A lack of treatment or secondary infections could prove fatal.

Symptoms include appearance of blisters and rashes, body ache, high fever ranging from 100-105 F [37.8-40.5 deg C] and sore throat. Blisters could be filled with water in some cases.

The incubation period of the disease is 14-21 days. In males above 13 years, complications can result in inflammation of the testes that may lead to sterility. The patient must be kept in complete isolation until blisters dry up. If diagnosed early, the disease can be controlled to a large extent. Those who get chickenpox develop immunity against the virus.

Varicella zoster virus enters through the respiratory system, targeting the skin and peripheral nerves. The period of illness is from 3-4 days. One to 2 days before the rashes appear, is when this virus is the most contagious. Some signs and symptoms are vesicles that fill with pus, rupture, and scab before healing. Lesions tend to stay towards the face, throat, and lower back sometimes on the chest and shoulders.

In about 10-20 percent of cases, VZV reactivates later in life, producing a disease known as shingles or herpes zoster. VZV can also infect the central nervous system.

There are 2 vaccines to prevent chicken pox:
MMRV: combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine
Varicella: varicella (chickenpox) vaccine

Chickenpox vaccine is very effective. 2 doses of the vaccine are about 98 percent effective at preventing chickenpox. Some people who are vaccinated against chickenpox may still get the disease. However, it is usually milder with fewer skin blisters and little or no fever.

Children under 13 years old should get 2 doses of the chickenpox vaccine [initially] at 12 through 15 months, 2nd dose: 4 through 6 years (may be given earlier, if at least 3 months after the 1st dose).

People 13 years or older (who have never had chickenpox and never received chickenpox vaccine) should get 2 doses at least 28 days apart.

MMRV is licensed for use in children 12 months-12 years old. Your child's doctor can help you decide which vaccine to use.

However, pregnant women should wait to get the chickenpox vaccine until after they have given birth. Women should not get pregnant for 1 month after getting the chickenpox vaccine.

(Excerpted from https://www.vaccines.gov/diseases/chickenpox/index.html)

If people are hesitant to have their children vaccinated with MMR vaccine, the same problems with vaccine insufficiency will be encountered with MMRV vaccine. This is the most efficient approach and is highly effective. Whether keeping varicella vaccine as a separate vaccine will be more acceptable to the individuals reluctant to allow the MMR vaccine is a question. - Mod.LK]
