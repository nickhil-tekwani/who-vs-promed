-----------------------------------------
As of 8 Jun 2005, the cumulative total is now 405 cases with 48 deaths (CFR
= 11.9 percent). 314 cases have been discharged from hospital.
Control measures are underway including contact tracing, chemoprophylaxis
of household contacts, and immunization of high-risk groups. Serogroup A
has been confirmed by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD).
Public education, surveillance, vaccination of high-risk population and
chemoprophylaxis for close contacts within 48 hours of case detection continue.
Adjacent districts and states have been alerted to the need to be vigilant
for any suspected case and to take appropriate public health actions.
WHO is working closely with the national authorities and providing
technical support to the health authorities in the form of guidelines and
tools on meningococcal disease. WHO is providing input to the technical
working group to assist with surveillance, early detection, laboratory,
case management, prevention and control. WHO is assisting with the
epidemiological analysis and in improving preparedness and response.

[In the about 2 weeks since the last outbreak report, 37 new cases have
been reported along with 11 new deaths. It is likely that this case
fatality rate reflects deaths in some of the older cases, not yet included
or occurring after the last reporting date. - Mod.LL]
