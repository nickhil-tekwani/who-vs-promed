Louisiana: 16 New Cases; Total Now 32 Statewide; 2 Deaths Suspected
-------------------------------------------------------------------
16 new cases of West Nile virus infection, including 4 in Baton Rouge, were
announced on Mon 29 Jul 2002, doubling the statewide total to 32. The
mosquito-borne disease may have killed 2 people, one of whom lived in Baton
Rouge, health officials said.
Dr. Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist, said it will be a few days
before West Nile virus can be confirmed or ruled out as the cause of death
in the 2 cases. Also among the 16 new cases of the disease are a 17-year-old
man in Denham Springs, a 70-year-old woman in Port Allen and a 48-year-old
woman in Prairieville.
East Baton Rouge Parish Mosquito Control Director Matt Yates said that
evidence indicates 2 species of mosquito, the Asian tiger and the southern
house mosquito, are the primary carriers of the disease. They usually hatch
in containers near homes and don't fly far. Newly hatched mosquitoes must
bite an infected bird before the same insects can transmit the disease to
humans, Yates said. While spraying is being done across the parish, the
agency is focusing on a triangle with one point in the Hickory Ridge
subdivision-Pecue Lane area, another in the Greenwell Springs Road-Monterrey
Boulevard area and the third point near the Mississippi River. "That is also
the area where we found most of the dead blue jays," he said. The dead birds
provided the first confirmation that the disease was present. West Nile
encephalitis was first found in the United States in 1999 and arrived in
Louisiana 2 years later.
One of the new Baton Rouge cases is near the Greenwell Springs
Road-Monterrey area, Yates said. Another case is suspected in that area, he
added. Other cases are in the general areas of Perkins Road and College
Drive, in the Hickory Ridge subdivision area and in the Pecue Lane-Airline
Highway area. According to a chart of victims put together by the Louisiana
Department of Health and Hospitals, half of the 32 victims are 61 years old
or older. Only 7 are 39 or younger. There are 17 female victims and 15 male
victims. St. Tammany Parish has the most cases, a dozen. East Baton Rouge is
next with 5, and Livingston and Tangipahoa each have 4. There are 2 in
Ascension and one each in West Baton Rouge, Jefferson and East Feliciana
parishes. One victim's hometown is listed as Picayune, Miss. DHH officials
said he is being treated in a Louisiana hospital, but they aren't sure where
he contracted the disease. Another victim is listed as a 26 year-old man
with no known hometown.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent a team of 12
researchers to south Louisiana to study what is now the second largest
outbreak of the disease ever seen in the nation. "If this epidemic follows
the pattern of last year's St. Louis encephalitis outbreak, we'll be here
until October or November," said Roy Campbell, senior epidemiologist from
the CDC.
Yates said that knowing how the mosquitoes grow will help reduce the
outbreak, but only if the public takes action. Asian tiger mosquitoes like
to breed in water-filled containers. They prefer cleaner water and smaller
containers, such as the reservoirs under flowerpots on patios, small cans,
stopped up gutters and bird baths. They bite in the daytime and are
especially active in shady areas during the early morning and early evening
hours. The southern house mosquito likes dirtier water and prefers to lay
eggs in deeper containers, such as boats, large buckets and stagnant
ornamental pools. The female generally bites at night and can easily get
through torn screens, Yates said. Both types like to breed in water in
discarded tires, Yates said. It takes 7 to 14 days [the higher the
temperature, the shorter the cycle] for both species to complete their life
cycle from egg to biting adult.
