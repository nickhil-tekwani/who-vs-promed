Bird flu was found among dead birds in Turkey's western district of Bandirma's Edincik area, where around 1.2 million chickens are bred in poultry facilities. The 3 km surrounding the poultry facility where the flu was found was quarantined.

Bandirma District Governor Ali Manti said bird flu was discovered in a poultry facility in the Edincik region, the site of many chicken deaths in the past months.

"All protection measures were taken in the facility where the disease was determined. The cleaning process has been done after the killing and extermination processes. Poultry which was near the infected facility or held the risk of being infected was slaughtered," said Manti.

Manti said the investigation launched by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock's district directorate after more than 40 000 chickens died in 4 months was finalized, and samples taken from the dead birds had been sent to labs.

Poultry entrance and exit to and from Edincik have been banned. The regional governorate barred any kind of hunting in the region, while the gendarmerie blocked the road leading to Edincik. Only officials are allowed in the region.

Sait Koca, the head of the White Meat Industrialists' Union, said the reason for bird flu in Turkey was migrant birds, as the route of these birds included Bandirma, where the infection was reported.

"The viruses that migrant birds carry cannot enter closed production facilities. The chickens that are bred in the open as 'natural' are exposed to all external threats," said Koca.

[Edincik is located on the south shore of the Marmara Sea, northwest Turkey; see map at http://tinyurl.com/lovaq9l.

Earlier this year, January/February 2015, the virus was reported from wild birds (Rock dove, Black headed gull, Dalmatian pelican) and in a backyard poultry holding in neigbouring East Bulgaria (Burgas). An EU/ SCoPAFF presentation on the Bulgarian event, presented in Brussels on 17 Apr 2015, is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/2015041617_ai_bulgaria_en.pdf.

During the same meeting, another country on the Black Sea shores, Romania, presented a report on a severe outbreak in March 2015 affecting the pelican population in its delta area. A mortality of 46 percent in these wild birds was reported; for details, see http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/2015041617_hpai_h5n1_romania_en.pdf. (Thanks to Sabine Zentis for drawing our attention to the above presentations).

Turkey's previous HPAI H5N1 reports date back to 2008, when 6 of the outbreaks, which occurred along its northern shores along the Black Sea, were considered to have had their source in wild birds. (See commentary in posting 20080325.1118).

Further information on the Turkish event and its official notification, if confirmed, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
