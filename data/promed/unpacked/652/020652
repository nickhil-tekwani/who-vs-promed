Boyolali district, Central Java [Jawa Tengah], said there was a leptospirosis outbreak following the death of 5 residents from the deadly disease in the area.

"We consider there was an outbreak of the leptospirosis disease, because the disease had caused the death of 5 infected people in Nogosari and Ngemplak," Boyolali Health Office chief Yulianto Prabowo said here on Wednesday [16 Apr 2014]. Yulianto said the leptospirosis cases had been prevalent in Boyolali since 2012, with only 2 infected people in the Ngemplak sub-district.

Previously in 2011, there were reports of 6 people being infected from leptospirosis in Nogosari and Ngemplak, who were successfully cured.

Leptospirosis cases were again reported in 2014, when 4 people in Nogosari and 2 others in Ngemplak sub-districts were found to be suffering from the disease. Therefore, from this leptospirosis outbreak, the Boyolali Health Office is expected to increase its prevention effort before the disease spreads to other areas.

The Boyolali health office is working together with the Development Research Institute of Animal Borne Disease Control and the Banjarnegara Health Ministry office to handle the disease. "We are conducting studies in an effort to anticipate leptospirosis by examining the disease, its treatment and the rat population increase in the affected area," he said.

Leptospirosis is an infection caused by the _Leptospira_ bacteria. Symptoms can range from none to mild, such as headaches, muscles pains, and fevers, to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. The disease is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals. The most common animals to spread it are rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or water containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, the eyes, mouth or nose. "Cattle or animals besides rats, such as cats, cows, and goats, are also susceptible of contracting the disease as carriers," Yulianto said.
