The original article in Kompas (Indonesian newspaper) mentioned not only
the destruction of 150,000 (not 170,000) dogs but also 100,000 cats and
170,000 monkeys (long-tailed macaques).
The article says 5,000 dogs have already been killed and the local
government expects to kill all the animals by the end of this month.

[The destruction of cats may lead to an increase in the rodent population,
which may result in the appearance of rodent-related diseases such as
plague, Seoul and other hantaviruses, and flea-borne typhus - Mod.JW
