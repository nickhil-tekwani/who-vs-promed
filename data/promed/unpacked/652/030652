Meningococcal disease in France and the United Kingdom
------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization reported that in France there have been 6
cases to date [11 Apr 2000, with 3 deaths associated with _Neisseria
meningitidis_ serogroup W135. Of these, 2 were pilgrims returning from the
Haj, and 4 were family members. The first case was reported on 28 March
[2000, and the most recent on 8 April [2000. No common risk factor other
than the pilgrimage has yet been found. Strains were compared by the
national meningococcal reference centre at the Institut Pasteur. They all
belonged to the same clone.
WHO also reports that in the United Kingdom there have been 17 confirmed
cases so far, with 4 deaths. Of these, 11 were pilgrims returning from the
Haj and 6 cases were close contacts. The first case was reported on 21
March [2000 and the most recent on 7 April [2000. Ten of the confirmed
cases are of meningococcal group W135, a form of the disease rarely found
in the United Kingdom (30-50 cases each year).
Immunization against meningococcal disease A+C has been an entry
requirement by Saudi Arabia for pilgrims travelling to the Haj. However,
the meningococcal A+C vaccine does not protect against group W135 infection.

[ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving confirmed reports of
meningococcal disease due to _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup W135 in
people who attended the Haj and in their contacts. Meningococcal infections
are not reportable diseases in some countries. - Man. Ed. DS
