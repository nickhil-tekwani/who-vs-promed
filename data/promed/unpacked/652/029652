Saskatchewan's 1st case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry since May [2022] was confirmed on 9 Sep 2022. According to information on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) website, the latest case was discovered in the rural municipality of Laird. CFIA did not disclose the type of flock affected, nor did it disclose the size of the flock. This is the 1st case to be confirmed in Laird.

The last time HPAI was confirmed in the province was 25 May 2022; however, it was in a backyard flock. The last case in a commercial flock was confirmed in the rural municipality of Baildon on 4 May 2022.

To date [12 Sep 2022], 7 commercial poultry flocks in Saskatchewan have been affected by HPAI, as well as 7 backyard flocks. Other locations in Saskatchewan where HPAI was detected in commercial poultry include the rural municipalities of Kingsley, Montrose, Carmichael, Morse, Loreburn and Moose Creek. The Moose Creek case was the 1st for the province in 2022, with confirmation on 15 Apr 2022.

Prior to this case in Saskatchewan, the last 3 cases of HPAI in commercial poultry in Canada were all located in Alberta. Those cases were confirmed on 4 Sep 2022, 31 Aug 2022 and 23 Aug 2022. Before that, Canada's last case in commercial poultry was confirmed on 1 Aug 2022 in Quebec. Quebec also recently had a black bear test positive for HPAI.

Elsewhere in North America, the most recent cases of HPAI have been reported in the states of Minnesota, California and Ohio.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak in North America is again intensifying, with new cases being confirmed in commercial poultry in both the United States and Canada. Federal agencies have reported new cases in Manitoba, Canada, and Minnesota, United States, which share a border.

HPAI was detected in a commercial poultry flock in Manitoba, making it the 4th province in Canada to have a new confirmed case within the past week. Manitoba's latest case of HPAI was confirmed on 14 Sep 2022 in the rural municipality of Cartier, according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). Specific details regarding the species in the flock or the number of birds affected were not made available.

This is the 1st case of HPAI in Manitoba since 15 Jun 2022, but the 1st one in commercial poultry since 23 Apr 2022. So far in 2022, Manitoba has only had the 2 cases in commercial poultry, and 2 other cases in backyard poultry.

The Manitoba case follows cases confirmed on 12 Sep 2022 in 3 other provinces. Two cases were confirmed in Alberta, while one case each was reported in Alberta and Saskatchewan.

The Belize Agricultural Health Authority (BAHA) has placed a poultry farm in Blue Creek Village under quarantine after detecting the avian influenza in its animals. The farm currently houses over 25 000 chickens and is being monitored closely by BAHA officers.

Containment measures have been put in place to restrict poultry products exiting the Blue Creek community. A release from BAHA says this is being done to ensure the poultry industry is being protected against further introductions of the disease. Other measures being carried out include the implementation of movement control of live birds, eggs, and litter. [Channel 5 Belize] spoke over the phone with Miguel Depaz, the Director of the Animal Health Department at BAHA, late this evening [13 Sep 2022].

Miguel Depaz: "At this point in time we have identified only one infected farm with avian influenza in Blue Creek. The subtype is H5. When we diagnose either H5 or H7 we implement immediate control measures to control and eradicate the disease, given influenza is a viral disease, a very infectious, contagious that could have high mortality. We are not seeing the high mortality. There is some degree of mortality yes, but we must understand the pathogenicity of the virus can be either low or high. [This is a reference to avian influenza being either highly pathogenic or of low pathogenicity. - Mod.TG] But, whether it is low or high it requires immediate action by BAHA to control the disease because whether low or high it can create negative impact on the industry. We do not want to allow live poultry to move out of the area. We are uncertain what the situation is at the moment, so live poultry have the highest risk of spreading the virus and other products, processed products, less risk, but we still want to put some restrictions. In other words, a bird going to the slaughterhouse has to test negative for avian influenza. So, we are putting measures into place to reduce the risk of spread. With eggs, we have to ensure we test the layers so eggs would not be contaminated. Litter tends to be moved for fertilizing purposes. So, we want to prohibit movement of poultry liter."

[Channel 5 Belize]: "Does the influenza pose a risk to human health?"

Miguel Depaz: "Avian influenza is a poultry disease, but it is known to transmit to other species including transmission to humans. It has potential [to transfer - Mod.TG]. H5H7 is more a poultry disease, but I must say it can be transmitted to humans, but the transmission is not through consumption, I must reiterate and emphasize these points. You cannot get avian influenza by consuming poultry or consuming eggs. That is not the nature of how the virus spread."

Three new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were confirmed in the United States, with 2 of those cases in Minnesota and the other in California.

The presence of HPAI was confirmed in a flock of 34 200 commercial meat turkeys in Meeker County, Minnesota, on 8 Sep 2022 according to information provided by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). One day later [9 Sep 2022], APHIS confirmed the presence of HPAI in a flock of 17 100 turkey breeder hens in Becker County.

Meeker County has now had 7 confirmed cases of HPAI in 2022, all of which involved commercial turkey flocks. Becker County has had 3 cases. Two of those involved commercial poultry while the other involved a backyard flock.

To date [12 Sep 2022], Minnesota has had 62 HPAI cases in commercial poultry flocks and 22 cases in backyard flocks, with nearly 3.2 million birds affected.

Also on 9 Sep 2022, HPAI was confirmed in a commercial broiler breeder flock in Fresno County, California. The flock involved 23 900 chickens.

This is the 4th case of HPAI in Fresno County of 2022. All 4 of those involved commercial broiler breeders, with the 1st one being confirmed on 22 Aug 2022.

California has had 8 commercial poultry flocks and 4 backyard flocks affected by HPAI, with approximately 480 000 birds affected.

So far in 2022, HPAI has been confirmed in 2022 in commercial poultry in the states of Ohio, Utah, California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. The virus has also been found in commercial game bird operations in Texas, New York and South Dakota.

[6] Michigan (Ingham County): backyard flock
Date: Tue 13 Sep 2022
Source: Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development [edited]
https://www.michigan.gov/mdard/about/media/pressreleases/2022/09/13/avian-influenza-detected-in-ingham-county


Following an investigation by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (MDARD), the Michigan State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has detected the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard poultry flock from Ingham County. This is the 1st detection in Ingham County. Owners of domestic birds must maintain their vigilance and actively protect their flocks against the virus in every way they can.

"While this newest detection is unfortunate, it is not unexpected. Even though Michigan has not had a case of HPAI in domestic birds since May [2022], the disease was regularly being found in the state's wildlife, indicating the virus is still present in the environment," said State Veterinarian Dr. Nora Wineland. "As wild birds migrate and spread the virus this fall, it is vital for bird owners to take every step they can to protect their birds from being exposed to wild birds. Keeping HPAI out of Michigan's domestic flocks remains a team effort."

HPAI is a highly contagious virus that can be spread in various ways from flock to flock, including by wild birds, through contact with infected poultry, by equipment, and on the clothing and shoes of caretakers. To protect other flocks in Michigan, the premises is currently under quarantine, and the birds will be depopulated to prevent disease spread. The flock contained approximately 20 birds of various species.

For this detection, MDARD will not reinstate a stop for poultry and waterfowl exhibitions. However, individual fair boards can determine what type of shows are/are not allowed for their respective fairs. Exhibitors are encouraged to contact their local fair managers to learn more about their fair's protocols and requirements.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the public health risk associated with this avian influenza detection remains low. Also, no birds or bird products infected with HPAI will enter the commercial food chain. As a reminder, people should properly handle and cook all poultry and eggs.

Whether it's a few backyard birds or a large commercial flock, following a few key steps is fundamental to protect the health and vitality of Michigan's domestic birds:

- Prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors or ensuring their outdoor area is fully enclosed.
- Wash your hands before and after handling birds as well as when moving between different coops.
- Disinfecting boots and other gear when moving between coops.
- Do not share equipment or other supplies between coops or other farms.
- Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and other supplies between uses. If it cannot be disinfected, discard it.
- Using well or municipal water as drinking water for birds.
- Keep poultry feed secure to ensure there is no contact between the feed/feed ingredients and wild birds or rodents.

MDARD is continuing to work diligently with local, state, and federal partners to quickly respond to reports of sick or dead domestic birds to best mitigate the spread of HPAI and provide outreach.

Domestic bird owners and caretakers should watch for multiple sudden deaths in the flock, a drop in egg production, a significant decrease in water consumption, or an increase in sick birds. If avian influenza is suspected in domestic birds, contact MDARD immediately at 800-292-3939 (daytime) or 517-373-0440 (after-hours).

If anyone notices what appears to be unusual or unexplained deaths among wild bird populations, please report these cases to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) by:

- Using the DNR's Eyes in the Field app. Choose the "Diseased Wildlife" option among the selections for "Observation Forms."
- Calling the DNR Wildlife Disease Laboratory at 517-336-5030.

Subscribe to receive email notifications by visiting MDARD's website and clicking on the "Avian Influenza" link. After entering a valid email address, subscribers will receive updates and alerts regarding the status of avian influenza in Michigan whenever there are new developments to report. Additional resources can also be found at http://www.Michigan.gov/BirdFlu.

[7] Tennessee (Obion County): backyard flock
Date: Thu 15 Sep 2022

https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/stakeholder-info/sa_by_date/sa-2022/hpai-tn


The US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in a non-commercial backyard flock (poultry) in Obion County, Tennessee. Samples from the flock were tested at the Kord Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, part of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.

APHIS is working closely with state animal health officials in Tennessee on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property will be depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the public health risk associated with these avian influenza detections in birds remains low. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of all poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in areas around the affected flocks. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets and in migratory wild bird populations.

Anyone involved with poultry production from the small backyard to the large commercial producer should review their biosecurity activities to assure the health of their birds. APHIS has materials about biosecurity, including videos, checklists, and a toolkit available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/dtf-resources/dtf-resources.

USDA will report these findings to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to WOAH standards and minimize trade impacts. WOAH trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern. WOAH trade guidelines also call on member countries to not impose bans on the international trade of poultry commodities in response to notifications in non-poultry.

APHIS will continue to announce the 1st case of HPAI in commercial and backyard flocks detected in a state but will not announce subsequent detections in the state. All cases in commercial and backyard flocks will be listed on the APHIS website at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/2022-hpai.

In addition to practicing good biosecurity, all bird owners should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through APHIS' toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. APHIS urges producers to consider bringing birds indoors when possible to further prevent exposures. The Animal Health Protection Act authorizes APHIS to provide indemnity payments to producers for birds and eggs that must be depopulated during a disease response. APHIS also provides compensation for disposal activities and virus elimination activities. Additional information on biosecurity for backyard flocks can be found at http://healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov.

As the migration of wild birds moves south for the North American winter, so round 2 of the avian influenza begins. Once again, the migration is spreading avian influenza in its wake.

The protective measures you took in the spring need to be tightened up. Be on alert for sick birds. Remember to blow your nose before entering and after exiting a barn. Change coveralls frequently, and essentially between barns. Be sure to disinfect your boots and gloves. Limit personnel with your poultry. If you find sick birds, report to your veterinarian and the state agency in your state. - Mod.TG]
