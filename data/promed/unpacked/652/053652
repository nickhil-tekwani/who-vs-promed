Tissue samples of killer disease to be sent to US
-------------------------------------------------
Tissue samples of the mysterious killer disease raging at Bashail upazila
in Tangail will be sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), Atlanta, USA to detect the virus of the ailment, as the country has
no facility to determine the nature of viruses through laboratory culture.
The mysterious ailment has so far claimed 11 people and afflicted more than
20, according to the record of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control
and Research (IEDCR), the country's lone watchdog institute on diseases. No
new cases were reported in the last 2 days, the record also showed.
Professor Mahmudur Rahman, director of IEDCR told The Independent over the
phone, "We are taking all measures to send the tissue samples of the
unknown disease afflicting people to CDC through the World Health
Organization to ascertain the virus causing the ailment." He said, "there
is no facility in the country to identify viruses through laboratory
culture and the country has to depend on foreign laboratories for this
purpose."
The IEDCR had sent a team after the outbreak of the mysterious disease in
Bashail. It is thought that Nipah, a seasonal viral disease that causes
encephalitis, may have returned in a virulent form. The team yesterday
returned after visiting the affected areas and collecting tissue samples
from the patients.
Prof Mahmud said that medical experts had formulated preventive measures
and a treatment guideline for this unknown ailment and informed the
doctors, health care providers, and people in the affected areas. People
were advised not to panic and to report any fresh case to the nearby
hospitals as soon as possible, he added.
He also said: "Attendants to the affected people are advised to be careful
until the cause of the disease is detected. The attendants should wear nose
mask when coming into contact with the patients and they should wash and
scrub their hands thoroughly after nursing the patients." He said that
several guidelines had been formulated, which include one for doctors, for
nurses and other health care professionals about care of patients as well
as personal protective measures, and also one for the public and relatives
of the patients about what to do in the case of infection.
The experts did not rule out the possibility of it being an outbreak of
encephalitis, however, as the symptoms of the disease are similar to those
of encephalitis, which earlier killed many people across the country. Last
year many people were affected by this ailment in Bashail upazila, some of
whom succumbed. It seemed like some unknown disease which began with fever
followed by unconsciousness within one to two days of onset of fever.
Experts at CDC, Atlanta, identified the disease as encephalitis after the
government sent them tissue samples collected from patients.

[Nipah virus/henipavirus outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh in 2001,
2003, and 2004 (see references below), so a high index of suspicion as
mentioned above in the newswire is indicated. Other etiologies of
encephalitis are also of concern. A study to identify etiologies of
encephalitis in Bangladesh was conducted by the International Center for
Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B. Health and Science
Bulletin 2004; 2(4), Dec) : "A prospective, hospital-based study to
identify the causes of encephalitis in Bangladesh began in June 2003 at
Dhaka, Mymensingh, and Rajshahi Medical College Hospitals. Ten of the first
176 patients (6 per cent) enrolled in the study tested positive for
Japanese encephalitis, including 11 per cent (7/63) of patients recruited
from Rajshahi Medical College Hospital. Other pathogens identified during
preliminary testing included dengue virus [6 cases], herpes viruses [3
cases], _Neisseria meningitidis_ [11 cases], _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ [7
cases], and _Haemophilus influenzae_ [2 cases]."
(<http://www.icddrb.org/images/hsb24_Eng-surveillaance.pdf>). Table 1 in
the report gives the breakdown of number of cases by agents identified.
The authors concluded: "These data suggest that Japanese encephalitis virus
is an emerging cause of encephalitis in Bangladesh. Japanese encephalitis
infection has not been recognized in Bangladesh since an outbreak in 1977
near Mymensingh. No new cases were documented in that area for 2 years
following the outbreak and the outbreak was thought to be due to local
introduction of the virus from an endemic area. Most of the Japanese
encephalitis cases found in the current study were in Rajshahi Division,
which borders areas of known endemic Japanese encephalitis transmission in
India."
Of note, was that no positive cases of Nipah virus infection were
identified. This lack of identification of Nipah virus in any of the
specimens may be a reflection of the geography of the cases tested, or as
the authors discussed: "Despite recent outbreaks of Nipah virus
encephalitis in Bangladesh, there were no Nipah virus infections identified
in the first 110 serum samples tested. One possible explanation is that
Nipah patients did not meet the study inclusion criterion of pleocytosis.
During recent Nipah outbreaks, only 50 per cent of laboratory-confirmed
Nipah patients who received a lumbar puncture had evidence of pleocytosis
in the CSF (ICDDR,B: unpublished data)."
More information on this current outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
