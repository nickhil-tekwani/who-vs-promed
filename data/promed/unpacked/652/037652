Mississippi: First Case of St. Louis Encephalitis Since 1994 Confirmed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The first confirmed case of a mosquito-borne virus in Mississippi this year
has been identified by health officials, but it's not a case of West Nile
disease. The Mississippi State Health Department said on Fri 27 Jun 2003
that a Hinds County resident has St. Louis encephalitis, a viral disease
similar to West Nile fever. It is also the first case of mosquito-borne
virus confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in the United States
this year, health officials said.
In 2002, there were 193 human cases of West Nile virus infection in
Mississippi and 12 deaths. Most of those were reported in late July and
early August. The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta reported 284 West
Nile deaths in 2002 and more than 4000 cases nationwide.
Mississippi last reported a case of St. Louis encephalitis in 1994, health
officials said. "St. Louis can mirror West Nile in that it is not uncommon
to see outbreaks as opposed to isolated cases," said Sally Slavinski, an
epidemiologist with the state health department. Mississippi experienced an
outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis in 1975 with over 300 cases reported.
St. Louis encephalitis virus is transmitted through the bite of the same
type of mosquitoes as West Nile virus. The symptoms are also similar to
West Nile virus infection. Most people who are infected never become ill.
For those who do, symptoms range from slight fever and headaches to
disorientation, coma, and tremors.West Nile [fever] patients have also
reported rashes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea -- ailments not commonly
seen in those with St. Louis encephalitis, Slavinski said. No vaccine is
available for either disease.
Slavinski said the mosquito control measures already in place to fight West
Nile virus infection will help guard against St. Louis encephalitis virus
infection. Health officials have been looking for signs of West Nile
disease in mosquitoes and birds. Mississippi has identified 3 birds in
Hinds County with West Nile virus. Also, 3 horses in Lamar and Pearl River
counties have been diagnosed with Eastern equine encephalitis, another
mosquito-borne illness.

[The statement that this case is the first confirmation of a human
mosquito-borne virus infection by the Centers for Disease Control in the
United States this year is incorrect. A case of suspected West Nile virus
infection in a patient in Franklin County Washington State in early June
2003 was subsequently confirmed as St. Louis encephalitis. Confirmation of
a suspected case of West Nile virus infection in South Carolina is still
pending. - Mods.MPP/CP]
