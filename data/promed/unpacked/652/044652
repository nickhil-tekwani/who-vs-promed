_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ has spread through the AUD 70 million
[USD 56 million] tomato industry in Bundaberg, costing growers
thousands of dollars, and leaving more than 80 percent of some crops
infected; 3 years ago [2006] the virus, which stunts tomato growth and
is spread by the silverleaf whitefly, was discovered in southeast
Queensland, but couldn't be contained.

Queensland Primary Industries and Fisheries plant virologist John
Thomas says growers could be forced to change farming practices. "We
need better resistance in the cultivars that are suitable for the
Bundaberg district, and we also need some agronomic practices to
change," he says. "Growing tomatoes 12 months a year is a problem. We
really need a gap where there are no tomatoes present to reduce levels
of infection, although we really don't know what other plants are
affected."

[_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV; genus _Begomovirus_)
originates from the Middle East and is one of the most damaging
viruses of tomato worldwide. It can also affect a number of other
solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Symptoms on tomato include small
chlorotic puckered leaves and stunting of plants. Yield losses of up
to 80 percent have been reported. The virus is transmitted in a
persistent manner by the silverleaf whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype
B), which in itself is a serious pest of tomatoes and other vegetable
crops. It can also be transmitted by mechanical inoculation (poorly)
and by grafting, but is not transmitted by seed or contact between
plants.

Disease management may include use of certified vector and virus free
planting material, cultural practices, and removal of infected crop
residues and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants to
reduce inoculum. Control of the vector is most important in disease
control; however, this may cause problems of chemical residues on the
fruit and is extremely difficult in open field situations due to the
widespread presence and wide host range of the vector. Field cropping
of tomatoes has been abandoned in some areas due to TYLCV. Tomato
cultivars with increased resistance are available. Transgenic tomato
plants incorporating TYLCV capsid protein genes have been found to be
resistant to the virus.

In Australia, TYLCV was 1st reported in 2006 near Brisbane and has
spread in southern Queensland since then. The disease has been found
in many crops, with infection levels ranging from 5 to 100 percent of
plants. TYLCV is considered a major threat to tomato production. This
virus was shown to be distinct from _Tomato leaf curl Australia virus_
(TLCV) occurring in the Northern Territory and on Cape York Peninsula.
There are a number of related begomoviruses in the tomato yellow leaf
curl and tomato leaf curl clades that cause similar diseases on a
range of crops in different areas and can lead to considerable yield
losses.
