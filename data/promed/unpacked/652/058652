The Kentucky state veterinarian's office announced on 1 Oct 2015 that 2 additional horses -- 1 from Montgomery County and 1 from Nelson County -- have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), bringing the commonwealth's total for the year to 6.

In a statement Kentucky Equine Programs manager E S "Rusty" Ford relayed that the Montgomery County horse -- a 5 year old Tennessee walking horse gelding -- presented on 24 Sep 2015 with hind limb ataxia, general weakness, and muscle fasciculation (twitching) on and around shoulder area. As of 1 Oct 2015, the horse's condition was stable.

Meanwhile, the Nelson County horse -- a 10 year old Appaloosa stallion -- 1st developed mild neurologic signs, described as facial muscle fasciculation, back in May [2015]. Ford's statement said that, as of 1 Oct 2015, the horse continues to display recurring clinical signs.

Neither horse has a WNV vaccination history, the statement said.

In 2014 Kentucky confirmed 4 cases of WNV in horses on 4 premises.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 per cent.

The clinical signs of WNV can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as equine encephalitis, rabies, and equine herpesvirus; therefore it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3 to 6 week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

A horse from Eagle Point, Oregon, sampled on 25 Sep 2015, has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), the Jackson County Vector Control District announced on 30 Sep 2015.

"Oregon State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Corvallis confirmed the positive," said Jim Lunders, manager and biologist of the Jackson County Vector Control District.

West Nile was previously been detected in Jackson County during the 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014 mosquito seasons.

Lunders said horses are particularly susceptible to WNV because they have no protection from mosquito bites other than what their owners provide. A horse in a stall or pasture can't go inside or put on insect repellant when bothered by mosquitoes," he relayed, "Horse owners have a responsibility to minimize their animals exposure to mosquito bites and properly vaccinate them against diseases like WNV."

[It is tragic that horses have to suffer from this mosquitoborne virus when a very effective vaccine is available. It is usually combined with Eastern equine encephalitis and the vaccine is very effective in preventing the disease.

There are also mosquito repellants especially developed for the horse. They work well when used but the key is to use them and in the summer months the sweat may affect the spray so it is important to use both products, spray and vaccine, to protect your horse. - Mod.TG

WNV has become endemic in the lower 48 states of the USAs well as in southern Canada and the tropical and subtropical countries of the Western Hemisphere. Skipping even a year of vaccination puts equine animals at risk of infection. - Mod.TY
