Tests ordered as 1000 layer chickens die
----------------------------------------
Livestock officials yesterday collected blood and excrement samples of chickens
around a farm in Muang district in Suphan Buri province, after more than 1000
layer chickens there died. About 15 000 have been culled.
Nirundorn Aungtragoolsuk, director of Bureau of Disease Control and Veterinary
Services, said the operation was part of bird flu control measures, although it
has not yet been confirmed if the farm was infected with the virus.
In Suphan Buri last week indigenous chickens were confirmed as being infected
with bird flu. The province is under watch by the Livestock Development
Department.
Dr Nirundorn said the officials received a report on 12 Jul 2005 that more than
1000 layer chickens raised on the farm had died, prompting it to order the
culling of the rest.
The operation was completed on Thursday [14 Jul 2005], and the officials
yesterday collected samples from farms within a 5km radius to look for any
traces of the virus. The farm would be under watch for 21 days. Movements of
fowls within a 10 kilometre radius were also stopped.

[The OIE follow-up report No 61, presented as item 1 above, was preceded by
follow-up report No 60 covering the period prior to 8 Jul 2005; it is available
at <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/a_current.htm#Sec1>.
According to follow-up report 60, 5 lab-confirmed outbreaks have been recorded
in Suphan Buri province between 5-8 Jul 2005, affecting native poultry and
fighting cocks in villages where the biosecurity is minimal. The report
included the following footnote: "the case findings resulted from the 2nd
nationwide active surveillance campaign, being conducted 1-31 July 2005. The
purpose of this surveillance is to evaluate the present status of highly
pathogenic avian influenza after the 2nd wave of outbreaks (between 3 July 2004
and 12 April 2005). The last outbreaks reported previously were published in
Disease Information, 18 [16], 109, dated 22 April 2005".
In conclusion, it seems that since the beginning of July 2005, 9 outbreaks of
H5N1 have been detected and lab-confirmed in Thailand, all in one province. A
10th outbreak (item 2) is pending. The performance of the current nationwide
active surveillance might have been undertaken in order to enable Thailand to
regain its HPAI-free country status, renewing exports of poultry and products.
This, unfortunately, might have to be postponed in view of the findings. -
