The coordinator of the association of growers for agricultural development of the town of Petit-Goave [Ouest Department] reports that an unidentified disease is ravaging the plantations of millet.

The coordinator launched an SOS to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources to send a team of technicians to determine the causes of this disease that is spreading and take the necessary phytosanitary measures against this new scourge.

["Millets" is a collective term for various small seeded grasses used for human consumption, which includes species in the genera _Sorghum_, _Pennisetum_ and some others. They can be affected by a wide range of pathogens, several of which are known to occur in the region. Some of their pathogens may also be shared with other cereal crops such as maize and sugarcane. Reliable diagnosis will be crucial for development of control strategies in the affected crops above.
