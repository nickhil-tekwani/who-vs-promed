Residents of the city of Platina, about 417 km (259 mi) from the capital
[of the state of Sao Paulo], are daunted by an outbreak of spotted fever in
the city. The disease is transmitted by the star tick, which proliferates
during this time of the year due to the dry weather. Three people have died
in the city with symptoms of spotted fever, which are high fever, body
pains, and red spots on the skin. One of the cases is [a 52 year old
woman]. Two days before, [her 63 year old husband] died with the same
symptoms. The suspicion is that both died from spotted fever. The star tick
is found along the rivers where the capivara live [also known as cabybara
-- the capivara is a large semi-aquatic rodent (_Hydrochoerus
hydrochaeris_) of tropical South America with short limbs and a vestigial
tail, often attaining lengths of more than 1.2 metres (4 ft). A picture can
be found at

According to the coordinating secretary of health, Ana Claudia Pereira,
less than a month ago, another case was confirmed in the city. For this
reason, she is requesting that residents of the city avoid going to the
rivers in the region. In addition to the distribution of pamphlets, work is
proceeding to alert the population on the dangers of the disease.

In 2007, there were 2 deaths attributable to spotted fever in Campinas. In
2005, various cities in the interior of San Paulo had outbreaks of the
disease. A child, the daughter of a professor, died after contracting the
disease on the campus of Esalq, in Piracicaba, due to the proliferation of
capivaras [capybaras] in the area around the school of Agriculture.

[Brazilian spotted fever is known in Portuguese as "febre maculosa
brasileira". The disease is quite similar to Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
with only subtle differences. The etiological agent, _Rickettsia
ricketsii_, is considered almost identical to its American counterpart.

The disease was first described in 1929 but underwent a still-unexplained
disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985, it has been found with
increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states, but cases have
been seen in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo states. Recently, cases have
been identified in the state of Santa Catarina in the south. The main
vector tick is _Amblyomma cajennense_, but _A. cooperii_ has been also
implicated.
