Sanitary Alert: Dangerous Virus Enters the Country
----------------
For the 1st time, at least 2 cases of the serious West Nile Virus, a
disease propagated among birds and other animals through the bite of
a mosquito, have been detected in Argentina. This was confirmed last
night to La Nacion by a knowledgeable source from the National
Service for Agricultural Sanitation and Quality (Senasa). Both cases
were detected in horses, which typically are one of the mammal
species affected by this virus.
The same information source added that yesterday and in accordance to
international regulations, Senasa reported the news to the
International Office for Epizootics, based in Paris; it also informed
that it has temporarily banned the export of horses beginning next
Monday [24 Apr 2006].
As of today Senasa has not offered any specific details, like the
exact number of animals affected, the name of the breeding ranch, its
geographic location, the viral strain, or the preventive strategies
to be taken, all questions that are going to be addressed early next
week, as per our source.
Unofficially, though, there have been speculations that the equines
affected are Pure Bred racehorses from a ranch located in the county
of Capitan Sarmiento, in Buenos Aires Province, about 145 km. from
the capital city of Buenos Aires.
Doctor Horacio Lopez, Chief of Infectious Diseases of the School of
Medicine at the University of Buenos Aires, explained that most of
the infections in humans - about 80 percent-- do not produce any type
of symptoms. About 20 percent of infected people might show mild
flu-like symptoms.. And about one in 150 infected patients might
develop a more serious disease (encephalitis, meningitis or
meningoencephalitis).
Dr. Lopez mentioned that WNV belongs to the flavivirus family
"along with Saint Louis Virus [SLE, St. Louis Encephalitis], which
was the cause of the encephalitis outbreak in Cordoba Province last
year. Other related viruses are dengue and yellow fever."
From the Ministry of Health, Dr. Andres Leibovich, Undersecretary
for Preventive and Health Promotion Programs, informed that his
agency still does not have any information regarding the cases.
"Nevertheless, we are already taking measures and along with Senasa
and the Epidemiology Section of the Ministry of Health of Buenos
Aires Province we have started to draft a preventive strategy. But we
need to act with the responsibility that this subject deserves; our
epidemiological surveillance system has worked very well until now,
and we don't want to set off the alert in the population until we
have all the information that we need in this case."
Dr. Tomas Orduna, Chief of the Regional Pathologies and Tropical
Medicine at Muniz Hospital (an Infectious Diseases Reference Hospital
in Argentina), said that "it is very unusual that the cases detected
have occurred in mammals, not in birds; horses are one of the
sentinel species, but it is birds the ones that are the main
reservoir of the virus."
Dr. Orduna expanded saying that "if the virus is already in
mosquitoes, I must deduct from this that there have to be birds
infected as well, but that they have not been detected as yet.
Presently we are having the South-to-North bird migration (it is the
beginning of the winter season in the Southern Hemisphere), and the
epidemiological logic tells us that the virus will get here from the
Northern Hemisphere during their North-to-South migration. It is very
important to be cautious about the possibility of false positive diagnoses."

Comment from Maria Compte:
This is a follow up to the piece contributed yesterday on the
(possible) detection of West Nile virus in Argentina for the 1st time
[see [1] above]. The area around of San Antonio de Areco is well
known for high quality racing and polo horse-breeding ranches. In
addition, I am including a short article from March 2006 on mass
mortality in aquatic birds in Mendoza Province, which may or may not
be due to the same pathogen (Mendoza is located near Chile, more than
1000 km west of Buenos Aires Province location where the infected
racing horses have been detected).
Death of 2 Horses due to West Nile Virus is Confirmed
-------------------
They belong to a Racehorse Breeding Ranch in San Antonio de Areco. No
cases have been detected in humans, but a prevention plan is being set in place
The Ministry of Health of Buenos Aires Province confirmed yesterday
the death of 2 horses affected by West Nile virus (WNV) at the same
time that announced that no human cases have been reported, and that
it is already working in a preventive campaign.
The cases, which La Nacion informed of in yesterday's edition, were
communicated to the provincial government by the National Service for
Agricultural Sanitation and Quality (Senasa), last Thursday [20 Apr
2006]. On Friday [21 Apr 2006] a meeting between representatives of
that agency and of the national and provincial Ministries of Health took place.
"During this meeting we analyzed what actions to take, which must be
based on prevention. It must be emphasized to the population that
there are no human cases to date, and that this virus is not
contagious from person to person" told La Nacion the Director of
Epidemiology of Buenos Aires Province, Maria del Carmen Weis. "People
that might have been in contact with the affected horses should not
worry either. A human being can only be infected by the bite of an
infected common mosquito. it is in this aspect of the disease where
prevention must be developed", added the specialist. Still, since
1999 in the United States about 14 000 cases of people infected have
been detected, of whom more than 500 died.
The horses that died here as a consequence of WNV were 2 Pure Bred
Racing animals from San Antonio de Areco (Note: location is 113 km
northwest of city of Buenos Aires). The County's Mayor, Eduardo
Jordan, told La Nacion: "We are working to inform the population and
avoid misunderstanding and alarm. I don't yet know to which specific
farm the dead animals belong, we will know this on Monday (for
tomorrow)." It has been rumors that the affected ranch is an
important establishment that won several prestigious prices in the
last years, including the Carlos Pellegrini Grand Prize (Note: the
highest horse racetrack prize in Argentina)
Dr. Weis added that "Senasa is currently doing animal investigations,
and from the (human) sanitary areas we are working on prevention. We
are on alert and in continuing communication and epidemiological
surveillance." In the case that a person would be affected by WNV,
the consequences would depend on the virulence of the strain and the
immunological defenses of the patient. "There is no vaccine, and it
is a virus, so the treatment is based on observation of the
(clinical) evolution of the disease."
The confirmation of the arrival of the virus in the country has
brought worry to the horse breeding industry, based on the experience
of what happened in the United States in 2002, when the disease
sickened more than 15 000 horses, with a 30 percent mortality and
millions of dollars in losses for the horseracing industry.
Yesterday there where even speculations that one of the infected
horses died at the San Isidro Racetrack stables (One of the 2 main
racetracks in the city of Buenos Aires, located in a northern
suburb), after traveling from Entre Rios Province (about 400 km
northeast of Buenos Aires), but the President of the Racetrack
Committee of the Argentine Jockey Club, Pablo Piffaretti,
emphatically denied such version of the events. "To date [22 Apr
2006] at 2 PM, we have not have registered one single case. We know
that in the US horses are exposed to this disease and that it is
treated (?) with a vaccine. What I don't understand here is that a
horse has been the 1st to fall ill with the disease, when usually it
is birds the ones that are first detected. Monday [24 Apr 2006] we
will contact Senasa to work with them on this situation", said Piffaretti.
In addition, Mario Lopez Oliva, President of the Argentine
Association of Equine Veterinary Medicine, reminded that "Equines are
final hosts and do not transmit the disease to humans. The arrival of
this virus was only a matter of time and fortunately is findings us
well prepared, because we have good information on this disease. If
it would have first affected regular countryside horses, we most
people would probably not have noticed it." As per the expert's
opinion, it would not be necessary to cancel horse races, "unless all
the horses fell ill", and said that there are 2 types of vaccines
available for horses, one American and the other European, both of
which produce good immunity. Argentina is a strong exporter of sports
horses, an activity that has been temporarily suspended depending on
the sanitary regulations that will have to be put in place before the
horses are allowed to enter other regions. Just considering racing
animals, since 2005 over 500 horses were exported to other countries,
an trade that now will be put on hold.

Concern in Mendoza for Discovery of Dead Birds
In a lagoon, more than 50 were found. Samples of the dead birds were
sent to the University of Buenos Aires. Avian flu is ruled out.
-------------------
Staff from the Undesecretariat for the Environment established a
state of alert in the Llancanelo Lagoon, Department of Malargue, as a
consequence of the death of over 50 birds, registered this summer.
Authorities sent samples to the University of Buenos Aires to be
studied, which turned out negative for avian influenza, but now we
are waiting to rule out hepatitis or West Nile virus", a disease that
already has entered South America and that is said that it could
arrive in Mendoza within 2 years.
The affected birds belong to the species known as Coscoroba
(Coscoroba coscoroba, a waterfowl that look like a cross between a
swan and a goose and are most closely related to whistling ducks;
these birds are mostly residents and breed in Argentina and Chile,
but some migration takes place before the Argentine winter season to
Paraguay and Southern/ Central Brazil). This is one of 130 species
that inhabit the Malargue bodies of water, some of them residents,
other migratory, and many of them with endangered species status.
Due to this reason, the alert was declared early in order to try to
stop the spread of the virus in the lakes and lagoon of the province,
considering the migratory routes and the fact that Llancanelo Lagoon
is a Southern breeding site for many bird species from the
hemisphere. The official plan is to minimize the risk of an
ecological disaster in that natural environment due to some avian
epidemic" as was indicated by a report released by the Department of
Fauna of the Undersecretariat for the Environment.
"We need to realize the real probability of the imminence of the
arrival of West Nile virus to Llancanelo", warned the report, about
the disease which attacks humans, birds, mosquitoes, horses, and other mammals.
In the meantime, an Program of Epidemic Surveillance and Emerging
Diseases has been set in motion, with the formation of a committee
that will coordinate and centralize the information and establish a
management strategy to follow. Also a protocol has been set up in
Malargue to analyze dead birds in Llancanelo and obtain results in
the shortest time possible. Studies requiring higher level of
complexity will be sent to Buenos Aires.

Subject: west nile virus

In spite of lack of official formalities news distributed by
[reputable] media indicate that an outbreak of West Nile Virus was
diagnosed in horses in Argentina.
This onset in deep autumn raise suspicion about previous undetected
virus circulation.

[If these are the 1st documented cases in horses, there is likely no
natural immunity in the horses. That being the case, the disease if
often fatal in horses. Vaccination of horses is recommended. There
are 2 companies with vaccines available for horses in the US. There
may be other vaccines available in other countries. - Mod.TG]
[This is the 1st report of disease due to West Nile virus (WNV) in
South America. ProMED mail's prior report on the most southerly
extension of the virus in the Western Hemisphere was in Trinidad (see
ProMED-mail posting West Nile virus update 2005 - Western Hemisphere
(01) 20050106.0033) with a report of 2 seropositive horses and 3
seropositive birds. One wonders if the other countries along the
route (see map of South America at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/south_america_ref04.jpg>)
have had WNV infections but have not as yet confirmed the presence of
the virus in their countries (this moderator's favorite adage "seek
and ye shall find"). Information from knowledgeable sources in
Argentina, and in other countries in South America on WNV activity in
their countries would be very much appreciated.
While WNV has not commonly been reported from waterfowl, there has
been a wide range of species that have been infected with the virus
as seen in the North American experience. It is interesting that the
above newswire in [3] did speculate WNV as a possible etiology for
the avian die-off, mentioning that it has already entered South
America. For an excellent review of the North American experience
with WNV, see Glaser A. West Nile virus and North America: an
unfolding story. Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz., 2004, 23 (2),
