The CODA-CERVA (Belgium) is actually coordinating a project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on the comparison of lumpy skin disease [LSD] vaccines. The Pirbright Laboratory is partner in this project. We will compare 6 different vaccines. These vaccines will be live attenuated LSD vaccines, live attenuated sheeppox or goatpox vaccines, and newly developed inactivated vaccines. The inactivated LSD and sheeppox vaccines are developed by MCI Sante Animale in Marocco. The animal trials are done at CODA-CERVA.

This project was preceded by a little project in which we evaluated and improved the challenge model. This part is financially supported by CODA-CERVA and EC DG SANCO through EU-FMD.

The project will also be supplemented by a project financially supported by the Belgium Government in which we will compare more vaccines and the booster effect.

The whole project gets a lot of support through advice from Dr Eeva Tuppurainen, from the CVO of Israel, from researchers in Israel, from Prof Estelle Venter from South Africa and several companies making their vaccines available.

So, we hope that in this way we will have more information about the existing vaccines and that in near future the inactivated vaccines will be available.

[The above response addresses the following request for information included in posting 20150926.3672096:

"When BTV-8 spread in north/central Europe (2006-2008), the mass application of vaccines with live attenuated virus was spared by the development and manufacturing of an inactivated vaccine (recently, applied around the new focus in central France). Later, when another vectorborne virus appeared in Europe, namely the Orthobunyavirus coined Schmallenberg, similarly an inactivated vaccine was developed, approved and manufactured. It will be interesting to note if a similar approach/effort has been undertaken in Europe in regard to LSD."

Subscribers are referred to our 28 Sep 2015 posting 20150928.3676844, reporting that the LSD epizootic in north eastern Greece is continuing its spread, affecting susceptible cattle. Emergency vaccination has been launched.

The information provided by Dr De Clerck, for which we are most grateful, is indeed encouraging. We look forward to the outcome of the essential activities undertaken cooperatively by the named institutions and to the expected recommendations.
