Equateur province: 114 cases with 5 deaths due to monkeypox reported in Bikoro
-----------------------------------------------------------
The disease [known as] monkeypox, also known as monkey variola, has raged
in the north and south of Equateur province. At least 3 health zones are
affected. For example, in the Bikoro health zone, 114 people have
contracted the disease and 5 have died.

According to the WHO Equateur provincial branch, the Bikoro health zone has
broken the record with 114 cases. Most of the cases have been reported in
the Mooto health area, about 82 kilometers [51 mi] from Mbandaka.

Two weeks ago, medical authorities suspected the presence of a similar
disease in the Gbadolite health zone. According to the WHO/Equateur
regional medical officer, Louis Pia, laboratory tests on specimens from
patients that were sent to the INRB (National Institute for Biomedical
Research) in Kinshasa, confirmed that the cause was monkeypox virus.

The disease has been reported also in Boende health zone. The same
confirmation has been made on specimens taken from patients [in Boende]. It
is still unclear how many have been infected [overall in Equateur].

To deal with this epidemic, medical advice is for observation of hygiene
rules. The medical officer also asked farmers in the affected health zones
not pick up dead animals in the forest, including monkeys, squirrels, and
pangolins that transmit this disease to humans.

[A recent investigation suggests that monkeypox virus, to which the
smallpox vaccine also provides immunity, is now at least 20 times as common
as it was shortly after the eradication of smallpox and the relaxation of
immunisation. (For a detailed discussion see ProMED-mail Monkeypox,
increased incidence - Congo DR 20100901.3124, and AW Rimoina et al. Major
increase in human monkeypox incidence 30 years after smallpox vaccination
campaigns cease in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Proc Natl Acad Sci
USA. 2010; 107(37): 16262-7. <http://www.pnas.org/content/107/37/16262.long>.)

Whereas monkeypox virus infection is somewhat less serious than smallpox,
it can still scar and even kill its victims. And in contrast to smallpox,
monkeypox is not only able to jump between humans, but can infect through
contact with the small animals that harbor the virus (such as rodents,
squirrels, and monkeys). As a result, its control may be more difficult to
achieve.

The virus species _Monkeypox virus_ is a member of the genus
_Orthopoxvirus_. Monkeypox virus can cause a disease in humans that is
clinically similar to smallpox and outbreaks in central Africa have been
associated with significant mortality (such as reported above), although
none occurred in an outbreak in the USA in 2003 associated with introduced
African rodents. An important difference between monkeypox virus and
smallpox virus (variola virus) is that monkeypox virus so far has not
transmitted from person-to-person as efficiently as variola virus. Indeed
monkeypox virus is normally resident in rodents and squirrels but can be
transmitted to other species as zoonoses. Phylogenetically the species
_Monkeypox virus_ is among the most divergent viral species from the
species _ Variola virus_. In fact variola virus is more closely related to
camelpox virus than to monkeypox virus. Consequently evolution of monkeypox
virus into a variola-like virus by mutation and selection is improbable.
Nonetheless it has potential to cause significant disease in the human
population and might require in limited situations reuse of vaccinia virus
vaccine.
