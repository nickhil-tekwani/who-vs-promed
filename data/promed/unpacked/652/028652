Teikyo University Hospital said on Friday [3 Sep 2010] that since late last
year [2009] 27 out of 46 patients infected with an antibiotic-resistant
bacterium called acinetobacter have died, including 9 whose deaths are
possibly attributable to the "super bug" that the hospital did not report
until Thursday [2 Sep 2010].

The 1st death occurred last October [2009], said the hospital in Bunkyo
Ward, Tokyo. It launched an in-house investigation panel this July [2010]
but did not make an announcement.

Acinetobacter bacteria are microbes found in many parts of the environment,
including sewage, soil, and water. They are resistant to most antibiotics,
but certain cephem antibiotics are effective in treating acinetobacter
infections, according to the hospital.

On Saturday [4 Sep 2010], the Tokyo Metropolitan Government also announced
that 3 inpatients at the same hospital have been infected with another
antibiotic-resistant bacterium, multidrug-resistant _Pseudomonas
aeruginosa_, with one suspected fatality.

The hospital reported the 3 cases to the metro government on Thursday [2
Sep 2010], at the same time as it reported the outbreak of acinetobacter
infections, the officials said.

Police on Monday [6 Sep 2010] will likely question a doctor at the hospital
on a voluntary basis, suspecting professional negligence resulting in
death, investigative sources said.

The 9 patients who are thought to have died due to in-hospital infection
with acinetobacter were men and women aged from 53 to 89, according to the
hospital. They were suffering from immunological deterioration as a result
of such diseases as leukemia and renal insufficiency before they passed
away between October [2009] and August [2010], the hospital said. Healthy
people are not at a high risk of infection, according to experts. Of the 18
other deaths, 12 were unrelated to the infection while a connection between
6 deaths and the infection has yet to be found. It is still unknown how the
46 patients came to be infected with the bacteria. Currently, 9 are being
treated in a special ward, the hospital said.

The metro government said on Friday [3 Sep 2010] that it had received no
report on acinetobacter infection from the Teikyo hospital when it
conducted an on-site inspection jointly with the central government last
month [August 2010]. The hospital should have submitted a report no later
than July [2010], when it set up an in-house investigation committee, the
metro government added. The hospital informed the ministry and the Tokyo
government of the infection cases on Thursday [2 Sep 2010]. "We have
addressed the cases with the treatment of patients in mind but should have
made them public earlier," Shigeho Morita, director of the hospital, told
reporters Friday.

Despite the announcement of the 46 cases of infection, the cases pf
pseudomonal infection were not revealed on Friday [3 Sep 2010] by either
the hospital or the metro government. A Tokyo government official explained
on Saturday [4 Sep 2010] that it did not give out the information as
infections with _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, unlike those with acinetobacter,
are not uncommon and that the incidence of infection was low. Pseudomonas
infection was detected in 3 patients in the same hospital ward between June
and August [2010], one of whom (suffering from heart disease) died on [24
Aug 2010] of blood poisoning brought on by a bacterial infection, the
official said, adding that there is a strong possibility the pseudomonas
bacterium was to blame for the death.

In Aichi Prefecture, 24 inpatients at Fujita Health University Hospital
have been infected with acinetobacter since February [2010], hospital
officials said. Of the 24 patients, 6 have died, but the fatalities are
probably not linked to the infection, according to a local public health
center.

[The news release above fails to state if the cases of nosocomial
multidrug-resistant acinetobacter infection were clustered in time or
location within Teikyo University Hospital or if DNA fingerprinting of the
clinical isolates was done and if any of the clinical isolates proved to
have identical genotypes.

Infection due to multidrug-resistant acinetobacter strains, especially
_Acinetobacter baumannii_ (MDR-Ab), in critically ill, hospitalized
patients, and the frequency of clonal nosocomial outbreaks due to these
microorganisms has increased worldwide in the past several decades (see:
Urban C, et al. Considerations in control and treatment of nosocomial
infections due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Clin
Infect Dis. 2003; 36(10): 1268-74; available at
<http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/374847>). MDR-Ab have
also been reported recently to cause infections after natural disasters
(see
<http://www-nehc.med.navy.mil/downloads/prevmed/acinetobacter_100208.pdf>)
and in soldiers severely injured in the war in Iraq.

During nosocomial outbreaks, MDR-Ab have been recovered from various sites
in the patients' environment, including bed curtains, furniture, and
hospital equipment. MDR-Ab has been reported to spread most commonly on the
hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from
patients who are either infected or colonized with MDR-Ab.

Resistance to multiple commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins,
carbapenems, cephalosporins, monobactams, aminoglycosides, and
fluoroquinolones, severely restricts treatment options for infections
caused by MDR-Ab. The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in MDR-Ab include
various aminoglycoside inactivating enzymes, plasmid-mediated, and/or
chromosomal-linked beta-lactamases that inactivate beta-lactam antibiotics,
alteration of targets for antimicrobial drugs such as the
penicillin-binding proteins, and antibiotic efflux pumps; these mechanisms
are at times combined with absent or reduced expression of porin channels
that limit penetration of antibiotics to their site of action (see:
Dijkshoorn L, et al. An increasing threat in hospitals: multidrug-resistant
_Acinetobacter baumannii_. Nat Rev Microbiol. 2007; 5: 939-51; abstract
available at <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18007677>). Some isolates
are susceptible only to the polymyxins and sulbactam (Go ES, Urban C, et
al. Clinical and molecular epidemiology of _Acinetobacter_ infections
sensitive only to polymyxin B and sulbactam. Lancet North Am Ed. 1994;
344(8933):1329-32; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968028>), although resistance to these
antibiotics has also been reported.

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-Ab
have involved surveillance and restriction of antibiotic use and enhanced
infection control interventions (see: Urban C, et al (2003): reference above).
