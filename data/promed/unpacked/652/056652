Outbreak of corridor fever feared
---------------------------------
An outbreak of corridor disease [aka Theileriosis, East Coast fever - Mod.JW]
has been blamed for the death of cows in the Pongolo area. KZN MEC
(KwaZulu-Natal Member of the Executive Council) for Agriculture and
Environmental Affairs Mtholephi Mthimkhulu said the department does
not know the actual number of deaths, but suspects it could be in
excess of 20.

A statement released by the department said the MEC has put together
a team of scientists to establish the exact cause of the deaths and
to find an immediate solution. All the symptoms are pointing to
corridor disease, the department said.

It is believed the cows could have contracted the disease after
grazing in the same fields as some buffalo from the Ithala Game
Reserve. The department said it has taken immediate steps to try and
stop more deaths from occurring by ordering that all buffalo at
Ithala be moved away from areas close to the human settlements to
avoid the infection of livestock.

But when The Witness contacted Ithala, manager Jeffrey Makwala said
he had no knowledge of the outbreak. "I have not heard anything about
cows dying around here" said Makwala.

The KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Union (Kwanalu) also said they had not
been informed about the deaths. Sandy La Marque, the CEO of Kwanalu,
said: "If there is an outbreak we have not heard anything about it".

The department said it has sent an order to Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife to
increase the number of security personnel that guard against mixed
grazing and that it will be introducing a public education programme
targeted at all communities bordering nature reserves to ensure that
they understand the dangers of mixing wildlife with domesticated stock.

[Corridor disease is a highly pathogenic disease of cape buffaloes
(_Syncerus caffer_) and cattle in eastern and southern Africa caused by
the protozoan _Theileria parva lawrencei_ and transmitted primarily
by the tick _Rhipicephalus appendiculatus_; lesions and symptoms are
similar to those of East Coast fever. It is one of 3
epidemiologically different diseases of which 3 different types of
_T. parva_ are the respective causative agents; the other 2 are East
Coast fever (ECF), caused by _T. p. parva_, and January disease,
caused by _T. p. bovis_. See also 19990512.0774.

Confirmation of the suspected outbreak or otherwise will be welcomed.
