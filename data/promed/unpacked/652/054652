The epidemic of tickborne encephalitis [TBE] increasing; 2nd man dies from TBE this week in the Sverdlovsk region
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Sverdlovsk region [oblast], 3-4 per cent of June [2015] ticks were infected with tickborne encephalitis virus. A 76 year old inhabitant of Yekaterinburg became the 2nd victim of the tickborne encephalitis; he died on 24 Jun [2015]. In a press-service of management of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being (Rospotrebnadzor) they have said that, in the 1st place, the man had not been vaccinated against tickborne encephalitis.

Press service of Rospotrebnadzor in the Sverdlovsk region have reported that currently 284 people are hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of tickborne viral encephalitis; this is 1.6 times less than in the same period of the previous year [2014]. The diagnosis has been confirmed in 35 people. Overall ticks have already bitten more than 25 000 people; only 1/4 of them were vaccinated.

On 17 Jun [2015], a 36 year old resident of town of Krasnouralsk in the Sverdlovsk region died from tickborne encephalitis and did not even notice where he had been bitten by a tick. Doctors call this situation as "bush factor"; according to statistics, 30 per cent of patients do not record the tick bites.

[This is the season of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in Russia. Russia, especially western Siberia, has the largest number of reported TBE cases. For additional details on TBE, see Mod.LL's extensive comments drawn from the US CDC (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/tickborne-encephalitis). It is unfortunate that these fatal cases had not received the vaccine. The CDC information notes that in Russia, 2 inactivated TBE vaccines are available: TBE-Moscow (Chumakov Institute, Russia) and EnceVir (Microgen, Russia). The European and Russian vaccines should provide cross-protection against all 3 TBEV subtypes. Vaccine failures have been reported, particularly in people aged at least 50 years.
