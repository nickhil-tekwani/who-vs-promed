[The following comment came from the FAO's Regional Office for Europe and Central Africa press release, published in November 2016. For the complete article, see http://www.fao.org/europe/news/detail-news/en/c/451313/:

"It was less than 2 months ago that FAO issued a warning [see posting 20160920.4501532] that H5N8 avian influenza virus had been detected in wild birds in Tyva Republic in southern Russia and would likely spread in a southwesterly direction with the autumn migration of water birds. The virus, which is highly pathogenic for poultry, appears already to have travelled westward as far as Poland and Hungary, and southwards to Kerala Province in India, according to recent official notifications to the World Organisation for Animal Health, or OIE."

"Events in the past week demonstrated that the virus has already spread from wild birds to domestic poultry," said FAO chief veterinary officer Juan Lubroth. The H5N8 virus has been detected in wild birds as well as domestic ducks in 4 states of India, and in Hungary, in a swan found dead in the southeastern part of the country, and a turkey flock in Totkomlos.

The dead mute swan in Hungary was found in late October 2016 near saline soda Lake Feher-to in Csongred County, a well-known resting place for migratory birds, according to Andriy Rozstalnyy, FAO animal production officer for Europe and Central Asia. Hungarian authorities have now identified the virus as being very similar to that found in wild birds at Lake Ubsu-Nuur, Tyva Republic in Russia in June [2016]. The locations -- in Hungary and India -- correspond roughly to the fall migration patterns of water birds, particularly _Anatidae_ species.

Earlier this week (7 Nov 2016), an H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus was also confirmed in wild birds in Poland. Though virological information is still awaited to confirm that it is the same strain, it is highly likely. While this article was under preparation, media reports of wild birds dying of the H5N8 virus in Austria, Croatia and Germany appeared. FAO continues to monitor the situation and will provide regular updates.

These recent detections of H5N8 virus in wild and domestic birds are additional evidence of the role of wild birds in the long-distance movement of H5 HPAI viruses from one stopover location to another along their migration routes. This appears to be the 4th documented wave of intercontinental movement of such viruses since 2005. The role of wild birds in their long-distance movement is now incontrovertible, according to a recent FAO news bulletin and other scientific publications.

Countries across the region should be on high alert for incursions of the virus, should adopt stronger biosecurity measures on all poultry farms, and enhance their surveillance, said Roztalnyy. All countries along the migratory pathways of the Anatidae family of birds are at risk, including countries of the Middle East, the European Union, West Africa, the former Soviet Union, and South Asia.

"We cannot predict which countries will experience outbreaks in poultry or cases in wild birds," Rozstalnyy said, "but all should consider measures to curtail the disease and prevent spread of the virus in poultry." The risk extends through March-April 2017 for Europe and the Middle East, he noted." - Mod.CRD
