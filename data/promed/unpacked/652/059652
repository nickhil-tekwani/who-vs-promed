Lumpy Skin Disease Spreads to Oshana, Oshikoto and Ohangwena
------------------------------------------------------------
The lumpy skin disease (LSD), which has been tormenting livestock in
the Kunene Region, has now spread to the regions of Oshana, Oshikoto
and Ohangwena. The disease is spreading fast, to the extent that on
Monday [16 Mar 2009] alone about 30 cattle owners here consulted the
State veterinary office in Ondangwa.

The farmers are now begging the Government to intervene because
according to them, the Government has been quiet since the outbreak.
Cattle owners claim that they cannot afford the vaccine for LSD, as
it is too expensive. Other farmers are unable to reach pharmacies
because of floods.

And to add salt to injury, the main pharmacies at Oshakati, Ondangwa,
and Eenhana have all run out of [vaccine] for the LSD. New Era has it
on good authority that pharmacies are experiencing problems with
their suppliers in South Africa. One of the most affected areas is
Onake in the Oshikoto Region, where hundreds of cattle are infected.

Dr Joseph Katapelo, a State veterinarian based at Ondangwa, said
although the mortality due to the disease is very low, the spread of
LSD it very high and worrying. Katapelo said the Government can help
the farmers to immunise their cattle, provided that the farmers buy
the [vaccine] for their livestock. "I am advising the farmers to get
together and buy the medicine. We will go where the animals are and
immunise them," said Kapapelo.

Lumpy skin disease is transmitted and mechanically spread through
insect bites of mosquitoes, biting flies and other biting insects.
The disease can also be transmitted through direct contact among
cattle. Kapapelo said LSD spreads easily during the rainy season.
Although LSD was also reported last year [2008] in the same regions,
according to Ondangwa State Veterinary, this year it is worse than
the previous years. He said LSD can be dangerous, as it cannot be
treated once the animal is infected.

"There is no specific treatment but long acting antibiotics can be
given to prevent secondary bacterial infection. Lumpy skin disease
can only be prevented by vaccination. Therefore farmers are
encouraged to consult their district veterinarians if this disease is
observed among the herd," said Kapepelo. "LSD is of economic
importance as infected cows may abort. Both in bulls and cows it can
result in temporary or sometimes permanent infertility," said Kapapelo.

Once the animal has recovered from LSD, it develops life-long
immunity; therefore immunisation is no longer necessary for such
animals. The disease is a generalised poxvirus disease of cattle
characterised by skin nodules, which usually vary in size. The
nodules are referred to as cutaneous form. The nodules can attack any
part of the animal's body -- the neck, briskets, legs, udder, scrotum
and the area around the muzzle are most sensitive.

Kapapelo said farmers can read other symptoms on the affected
animals. According to him, at times affected cattle show reduced
appetite, fever, reluctant to move, increased salivation and
discharge from the eyes and the nose, which is normally referred to
as the pulmonary form. Other signs are the enlargement of superficial
lymph nodes as well as oedema (swelling) of the legs.
