Egypt: Another 2 children test positive for avian influenza
-------------------------------------------------------------
CAIRO: 2 Egyptian children [the 30th and 31st cases - Mod.CP] have
tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus, bringing the total
number of human cases in Egypt to 31, Egypt's Health Ministry said on
Saturday [31 Mar 2007].
The Health Ministry identified the children as a 4-year-old boy of
Qena province, around 670 kilometres (416 miles)
south of Cairo, and a 7-year-old boy of Sohag province, around 467
kilometres south of Cairo.
A World Health Organisation (WHO) official confirmed the 2 new cases.
Both were admitted to hospital on Thursday suffering from fevers
after exposure to poultry, and both have been treated with the
antiviral Tamiflu, the standard treatment for the symptoms of the
disease, according to the statement. Both were in stable condition
and had been transferred to hospital in Cairo, it added.
Egypt has the highest number of confirmed human bird flu cases
outside Asia; 13 Egyptians have died from bird flu since it first
surfaced in the country's poultry a year ago. Most of those who fell
ill were reported to have had contact with sick or dead household
birds, primarily in northern Egypt.
On Tuesday 2 children [the 28 and 29th cases - Mod.CP] tested
positive for bird flu [see: Avian influenza, human (60): Egypt,
Indonesia, WHO 20070328.1067.] "They're all in stable condition and
alive," said Hassan al-Bushra, regional adviser for communicable
disease surveillance for WHO.
