Notes from the field: Fatal yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease -- Oregon, September 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: DeSilva M, Sharma A, Staples E, Arndt B, Shieh WJ, Shames J, Cieslak P]

In September 2014, a previously healthy Oregon woman in her 60s went to a hospital emergency department with malaise, dyspnea, vomiting, and diarrhea of 3-5 days' duration. She reported no recent travel, ill contacts, or dietary changes. She had received a single dose of yellow fever vaccine and typhoid vaccine 6 days earlier, before planned travel to South America...

She was admitted to the hospital with diagnoses of gastroenteritis, malaise, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia. Within 10 hours of admission, she experienced acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Contrast chest computed tomography indicated a substantial mediastinal mass. The patient experienced cardiogenic shock and acute renal failure and died 3 days after admission. At autopsy, the thymus was diffusely enlarged, consistent with thymoma.

Tissue and serum samples were tested at CDC for evidence of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease (YEL-AVD), a serious adverse reaction resulting from the uncontrolled replication of vaccine virus and characterized by multisystem organ dysfunction; 60 per cent of reported cases are fatal. Immunohistochemical staining indicated yellow fever virus antigen in tissue samples from various organs. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction detected yellow fever vaccine viral RNA in multiple organs and in a serum sample that had been collected 2 days before death. Additionally, a serum sample obtained 1 day before death demonstrated evidence of yellow fever immunoglobulin M, with a yellow fever virus-specific neutralizing antibody titer of 640. Testing of yellow fever viral RNA from the vaccine lot used to vaccinate the woman identified sequences consistent with known vaccine strains without any notable mutations.

The patient's clinical course and laboratory results, including her requirement for mechanical ventilation, met Level 1 diagnostic certainty for viscerotropic disease. The temporal relationship between yellow fever vaccination and development of symptoms was consistent with YEL-AVD. The presence of yellow fever virus-specific antigen in multiple organs demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, in addition to amplification of yellow fever 17D viral RNA from tissue, met criteria for definite yellow fever vaccine-associated causality. Both her age at vaccination and occult thymic disease likely predisposed this patient to YEL-AVD development.

The risk for YEL-AVD in the United States is approximately 0.4 cases per 100 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine distributed; older age and thymic disease have been associated with an increased risk for YEL-AVD. Risk increases to one case per 100 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine distributed for travelers aged 60 years or older and 2.3 cases per 100 000 doses for those aged 70 years or older. Of the 1st 23 YEL-AVD cases described, 4 (17 per cent) were in patients who had a history of thymoma. Risk related to thymic disease might persist even after thymus resection. The incidence of thymoma in the United States is approximately 0.13 per 100 000 person-years, increasing with age and peaking among persons aged 60 years or oder. Approximately 1/3 of thymomas are diagnosed among asymptomatic patients on the basis of abnormal chest radiographs or computed tomography; 10-20 per cent of patients with myasthenia gravis have a thymoma, and approximately 30 per cent of patients with thymoma have thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis.

Although yellow fever vaccination would have been contraindicated in this patient had it been known that she had a thymoma or myasthenia gravis, there is no national recommendation for routine screening for thymic disease before receipt of yellow fever vaccine. This appears to be the first published report on a case of YEL-AVD in a person with undiagnosed thymoma since the package insert for yellow fever vaccine available in the United States was updated to include a history of thymus disorder as a contraindication to vaccine administration in 2003.

Although most persons have no or mild adverse events after yellow fever vaccination, the benefits of vaccination among travelers who have a limited exposure period need to be weighed against risk for adverse events. Yellow fever can range in severity from a mild febrile illness to severe disease with jaundice and hemorrhage; the case-fatality ratio for severe yellow fever disease is 20-50 per cent. An estimated 200 000 yellow fever cases occur worldwide annually, with approximately 87 per cent in Africa. The live, attenuated vaccine is recommended for persons living in or traveling to tropical South America and sub-Saharan Africa; proof of yellow fever vaccination can be required for entry into certain countries. When determining whether a patient should receive yellow fever vaccine, the patient and clinician should discuss the risk for travel-associated yellow fever disease as indicated by season, destinations and duration of travel, likelihood of exposure to mosquitoes while traveling, and vaccination status, and weigh them against risks associated with vaccination.

[Although generalized disease from yellow fever vaccines is extremely rare, it does occur. Since 1945, 27 cases of YEL-AND, including 7 US cases, have been reported worldwide. YEL-AVD was recognized in 2002 and since 1996, 12 cases of YEL-AVD, including 6 US cases, had been reported worldwide (see ProMED-mail archive no 20021108.5756).

However, travelers do need to be advised that the risk of serious disease and fatalities from vaccines is less than those caused by YF virus infections acquired in nature, but contraindications noted above need to be taken into account. In addition to those contraindications, there is evidence that YF vaccine virus transmission has occurred to breast-feeding infants (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110209.0440) and from transfusions. Because there is a low-level viremia 3-7 days following YF vaccination, there is a risk of transmission of the virus via transfused blood products during this viremic period (see ProMED-archive no. 20100121.0241). One hopes that the new generation of YF vaccines under development currently will reduce that small risk of YEL-ADV even further, while providing solid immunity against YF virus infections in nature.

Health care workers who may attend YEL-ADV patients should read the full original report. References and clinical details are available at the above URL.
