Alert on an outbreak of diphtheria in Mercado 4
-----------------------------------------------
The diagnosis of diphtheria in 2 girls, who are sisters, living in
the Mercado 4 section [of Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay] has
prompted a mass vaccination campaign to try to stop the disease.
Diphtheria is known to be highly contagious and can seriously endanger
the lives of affected children and adults.

>From this morning [13 Jun 2011], the Ministry of Health, through the
Expanded Programme on Immunization [EPI] and the 18th Health Region,
will vaccinate the entire population of Mercado 4 and surrounding
areas against diphtheria. According to the ministry officials of the
area, there is no distinction by age, that is, children and adults
alike should be vaccinated. Health authorities are also requesting
that adults should have their children's vaccination books on hand.
The vaccination campaign will start at 06:30 [6:30 AM] and will run
until 13:30 [1:30 PM].

According to a needs assessment of the area, there will be 13
vaccination brigades in the Mercado 4 area of influence, both mobile
and fixed/stable teams. The mobile teams will visit all places of sale
or resale of goods to ensure the vaccination of workers; equally, the
fixed posts will be on the block or principal access areas to the
nursery and primary school of the area and also will be in the
Bonanza, Florida, and Santo Domingo shopping centers.

The area in which the vaccination strategy will be implemented
comprises: Avenida Pettirossi on the north, Avenida Ana Diaz on the
south, Avenida Peru on the west, and Avenida Yguape on the east. [For
a map of this area, see http://www.panoramio.com/photo/25918582].

This activity will include regional brigades, 2 brigades of the
Municipal Polyclinic, 2 brigades of the Sacred Heart of Jesus health
post, EPI supervisors, coordinators, and 6 Municipal Market
supervisors.

There will also be support for outreach through community radio, "the
voice of the market," 87.9 FM and the delivery of information
leaflets, a task to be undertaken by the Department of Mercado 4
Collections. For those days there will also be additional activities
such as control of blood pressure and blood glucose (sugar level in
the blood to detect diabetes). The official launch of this campaign
will be held at the esplanade of Mercado 4 on Pettirossi Avenue, at
9:00 [9:00 AM].

[ProMED-mail previously posted an outbreak of diphtheria in Paraguay
in 2002 that involved 10 patients, 3 of whom died, associated with
histories of inadequate vaccination against diphtheria (ProMED-mail
post Diphtheria - Paraguay (Central) 20020517.4239).

The following concerning exposure to diphtheria is extracted from a
CDC Health Alert from 2003
(http://www.bt.cdc.gov/HAN/han00161.asp):

"Diphtheria is caused by toxigenic strains of the bacterium
_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. The mainstay of therapy is
administration of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT). DAT should be given when
diphtheria is suspected without waiting for laboratory confirmation.
In the USA, DAT is only available from the CDC. Suspected diphtheria
case-patients should also receive antibiotics to eradicate carriage of
_C. diphtheriae_. When respiratory diphtheria is suspected in a
patient, Td [diphtheria toxoid] vaccination is recommended for the
patient's close contacts (that is, those who may have been exposed to
respiratory secretions or who are close household contacts) if Td has
not been administered within the last 5 years. These contacts should
have nasal and pharyngeal specimens obtained for culture and should
also be given antibiotic prophylaxis."

The following concerning vaccination against diphtheria is extracted
from CDC Vaccines and Preventable Diseases: Diphtheria Vaccination.
Available at
http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/diphtheria/default.htm:

"There are 4 combination vaccines used to prevent diphtheria,
tetanus, and pertussis: DTaP, Tdap, DT, and Td. 2 of these (DTaP and
DT) are given to children younger than 7 years of age, and 2 (Tdap and
Td) are given to older children and adults.

"Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the
following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15-18 months and 4-6 years. DT does not
contain pertussis, and is used as a substitute for DTaP for children
who cannot tolerate pertussis vaccine.

"Td is a tetanus-diphtheria vaccine given to adolescents and adults
as a booster shot every 10 years, or after an exposure to tetanus
under some circumstances. Tdap is similar to Td but also containing
protection against pertussis."

The following concerning vaccination against diphtheria in adults and
adolescents is extracted from CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report (MMWR) Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule - United States,
2011. 4 Feb 2011; 60(04): 1-4. Available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6004a10.htm?s_cid=mm6004a10_e:

"Administer a one-time dose of Tdap to adults aged less than 65 years
who have not received Tdap previously or for whom vaccine status is
unknown to replace one of the 10-year Td boosters, and as soon as
feasible to all 1) postpartum women, 2) close contacts of infants
younger than age 12 months (such as, grandparents and child-care
providers), and 3) health-care personnel with direct patient contact.
Adults aged 65 years and older who have not previously received Tdap
and who have close contact with an infant aged less than 12 months
also should be vaccinated. Other adults aged 65 years and older may
receive Tdap. Tdap can be administered regardless of interval since
the most recent tetanus or diphtheria-containing vaccine.

"Adults with uncertain or incomplete history of completing a 3-dose
primary vaccination series with Td-containing vaccines should begin or
complete a primary vaccination series. For unvaccinated adults,
administer the 1st 2 doses at least 4 weeks apart and the third dose
6-12 months after the 2nd. If incompletely vaccinated (that is, less
than 3 doses), administer remaining doses. Substitute a one-time dose
of Tdap for one of the doses of Td, either in the primary series or
for the routine booster, whichever comes first.

"If a woman is pregnant and received the most recent Td vaccination
10 or more years previously, administer Td during the 2nd or 3rd
trimester. If the woman received the most recent Td vaccination less
than 10 years previously, administer Tdap during the immediate
postpartum period. At the clinician's discretion, Td may be deferred
during pregnancy and Tdap substituted in the immediate postpartum
period, or Tdap may be administered instead of Td to a pregnant woman
after an informed discussion with the woman."

Asuncion, with a population of more than 2 million inhabitants, is
the capital and largest city of Paraguay. It can be located on the

The Mercado Cuatro (Mercado 4) is a huge outdoor market in central
Asuncion, selling all kind of cheap goods to capital inhabitants
