The viral disease that has broken out in eastern China's Shandong
province has killed a 3rd child, Xinhua said on Thu 24 May 2007,
raising doubts over earlier claims that the epidemic may have been
contained. The news agency said that an 11-month-old boy had
developed a fever and blisters before dying on Tue 22 May 2007 in a
hospital in Linyi city, where 1263 cases of hand, foot, and mouth
disease (HFMD) have been reported since April 2007. The virus, which
typically causes painful blisters around the mouth, throat, hands and
feet, had already claimed the lives of a 14-month-old boy earlier
this month [May 2007] and a 2-year-old girl on 29 Apr 2007.
Xinhua cited the provincial health bureau as saying that the outbreak
of the virus, which is highly contagious among children but not
normally fatal, was "slowing down." The government earlier said it
had been contained. The local government has launched a campaign to
remind parents to take preventive measures such as frequent hand washing.
Chinese bloggers in Shandong said in early May 2007 that 26 children
had died in the outbreak. Local media said authorities in Linyi had
denied that figure.

[The death of a 3rd child in the outbreak of HFMD in Linyi city in
Shandong province does invalidate the provincial government's
statement that the outbreak has now been contained. It does indicate,
however, that the virus has been responsible for a severe form of
HFMD, although perhaps not the neurological complications observed in
some outbreaks. This thread, previously cut, is rejoined again to
receive further information on the identity of the virus or viruses
involved. - Mod.CP]
