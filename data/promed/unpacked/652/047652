FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Public Information Office 26 Dec 2009 603-271-4051:

DHHS Announces Case of Gastrointestinal Anthrax in Concord, NH


The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has
confirmed a case of gastrointestinal anthrax in an adult female from
Strafford County. The patient is currently in critical condition.
DHHS's Division of Public Health Services (DPHS) along with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating
the source of the anthrax. The source of the anthrax is not yet
clear, but DPHS believes the anthrax to be naturally occurring from
the environment. There is no risk to the public, but DPHS and its
partners are taking every step possible to find the source.

"Our thoughts and concerns are with this patient and her family,"
said DHHS Commissioner Nicholas Toumpas. "This is a difficult and
unusual situation, and we are committing all possible resources to
determining the cause of this exposure as quickly as possible."

There are 3 types of anthrax infections: inhalation, cutaneous, and
gastrointestinal. Gastrointestinal anthrax is characterized by acute
inflammation of the intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss
of appetite, vomiting, and fever are followed by abdominal pain,
vomiting of blood, and severe diarrhea. The incubation period can be
anywhere from 3-60 days.

There have been 11 cases of naturally occurring anthrax in the United
States since 1957. One occurred recently in New York City and one in
Connecticut that were related to animal hides. Approximately 2000
cases of cutaneous naturally occurring disease are reported annually
worldwide. Person-to-person transmission of anthrax is extremely
unlikely, as the disease is caused by a spore that is ingested,
inhaled or enters through a cut in the skin. The last cases of
anthrax that were diagnosed in New Hampshire were back in 1957, when
there were 9 cases (4 cutaneous and 5 inhalation) in employees of a
textile mill in Manchester.

"We are working with many partners to conduct a thorough
investigation," said Public Health Director Dr. Jose Montero. "At
this point, we've alerted physicians; we have increased our
surveillance measures, and we are talking with our federal partners
as well to look at all possible sources that may play a part in this
case." One of the possibilities being examined are African drums.
"Even though it is a remote possibility for transmission, public
health officials are requesting owners of African drums who attended
African drummers circle events at the UNH campus ministries from
October to early December 2009 to contact DPHS at 271-4496 to discuss
the possibility of having their drums tested."

An adult Strafford County woman is in critical condition with a case
of gastrointestinal anthrax, health officials announced Saturday [26 Dec 2009].

While officials from the state Department of Health and Human
Services have yet to determine the source of the anthrax, they said
they believe the disease was naturally occurring.

The young woman owns an African drum and reportedly participated in a
community drum circle at Waysmeet Center in Durham, the ecumenical
United Campus Ministry for the University of New Hampshire community,
between October and early December 2009, state officials said. Animal
hides may sometimes be the source of naturally occurring anthrax, and
state officials are requesting that owners of African drums who
attended a drum circle during that time call DHHS at 271-4496.

While there is no need for individuals to be tested, the state wants
to conduct testing on any drums, as they are one of several possible
sources of the anthrax, according to Public Health Director Dr. Jose
Montero. Montero said the drums are being considered because the 2
most recent U.S. cases of anthrax involved drums.

In 2007, 2 members of a Connecticut family were treated for cutaneous
anthrax traced to animal hides used to make African drums. In 2006, a
New York dancer and drum maker recovered from the 1st case of
naturally occurring inhalation anthrax in the United States since 1976.

"Since we know that it happened before and was involved in this case,
we are following those leads," Montero said.

He said the victim tested positive for anthrax earlier this month
[December 2009], and the state was notified by Massachusetts health
officials about the positive test on 24 Dec 2009. The victim was
taken to an undisclosed Massachusetts hospital when her condition got
worse, Montero added.

He wouldn't say what Strafford County community the woman lived in or
give her age. The woman is not a UNH student, but the school said in
a statement that they are "cooperating fully with DHHS and their
thoughts and concerns are with the young woman and her family."

Montero stressed that health officials are focused on testing the
drums, not people, because person-to-person transmission of anthrax
is extremely unlikely, as the disease is caused by a spore that is
ingested, inhaled, or enters through a cut in the skin. "It's so
unusual that we don't expect more cases. Still, we're going to
conduct an extensive investigation," he said.

He said the state has alerted physicians, increased surveillance
measures and is working with its federal partners.

There are a number of odd things about this, starting with:

[1] How did it get recognised/diagnosed;

[2] G/E anthrax is uncommon; it is about 1/200th the incidence of
human cutaneous anthrax, and you have to have oral/oesophageal
exposure, e.g., normally from contaminated meat from a moribund or dead animal.

[3] G/E anthrax happens in a subset of pneumonic exposures from the
contaminated bronchial mucus swept up from the bronchioles and then
dumped into the esophagus, a different pathology from the normal feed
exposure, as there can be oesophageal lesions as well as lesions in
the intestines. So, if there was an infected aerosol, where are the
other pneumonic exposures?

This young lady's doctors are to be commended for thinking far
outside the box when presented with this case and for taking samples
before initiating any antibiotic treatment. Logic would presuppose,
if the drum hypothesis is correct, that she bought all her meat from
a recognized supermarket and that she was not exposed to meat derived
from a sick beast, which might have been butchered by a relative.
This would force an alternative exposure source, e.g., an African
drum. For confirmation, the genomic analysis of her cultures should
be identical with either her drum if contaminated or that of a
colleague's at the same performance. And if it were her drum, why did
she not get infected sooner from it when practicing at home? Ditto
her colleague. - Mod.MHJ]
