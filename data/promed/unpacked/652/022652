1st bird flu cases in northern Ukraine
-------------------------------------------
Teams of veterinarians have been sent to destroy domestic poultry in
northern Ukraine after the 1st appearance of bird flu in the region,
Interfax Ukraine news agency reported on Monday [12 Jun 2006].
Avian flu had previously been detected late last year [2005] in the Crimea
peninsula, a major stopover point on migratory routes, jutting into the
Black Sea in southern Ukraine.
Interfax, quoting Ukraine's Emergencies Ministry, said 77 specialists had
been sent along with police to a village in Sumy region, near the border
with Russia, after cases were noted on Sunday [11 Jun 2006]. Plans called
for 7200 birds to be destroyed.
It said villagers had been offered compensation.
The dispatch, however, made no mention of whether the virus detected was
the deadly H5N1 type, as was found in Crimea. Previous instances of bird
flu in Ukraine have required further checks at laboratories in western Europe.
Specialized teams of sanitary workers destroyed well over 200 000 birds
after the outbreak in Crimea. No human cases were recorded.
Ukraine's authorities have said that the outbreak was brought under control
but have predicted further difficulties during the passage of migratory
birds through the country this year [2006].

[Ukraine is joining Romania and Hungary in demonstrating that the forecasts
visualizing a hibernation of the H5N1 virus (which is, most probably,
responsible for the current focus) were premature.
