Arizona: 2nd Case of Human West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has now struck at the heart of Tucson, infecting an
elderly woman near Downtown, who is struggling to recover from severe
illness. This is the 2nd human case of West Nile virus infection in
Arizona known to have contracted the disease in-state. Both cases
have occurred in Pima County, with the first reported west of the
city -- in Sells on the Tohono O'odham Reservation -- last week. [Yes,
O'odham -- we checked. - Mod.JW].
Both victims, who were hospitalized, are expected to survive the
serious brain-affecting form of the disease, said county health
officials. In the first case, the Sells patient suffered meningitis,
an inflammation around the sac of the brain and spinal cord, causing
symptoms of high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, nausea and
vomiting.
But the most recent patient was hit with the most life-threatening
form of West Nile virus infection -- encephalitis, an inflammation of
the brain itself. Her symptoms indicated brain damage, including
mental confusion, muscle weakness, and partial paralysis. "She has
been sick for several weeks and is still taking time now to recover.
But that's not unusual for this form of West Nile," said Dr.
Elizabeth MacNeill, the county's chief medical officer.
80 percent of those infected with this virus show no symptoms at all.
But about 20 percent will get sick, most of those with what is known
as West Nile fever, a flulike illness. However, a very few -- less
than 1 percent -- will develop possibly fatal brain inflammation, and
will have to be hospitalized. Those are the cases most likely to be
reported and confirmed, as happened with the 2 Pima County cases.
The virus is passed to humans and horses by the bite of an infected
mosquito, which became infected after feeding on sick birds. It
cannot be passed from human to human, or horse to human. The current
late-season hot spell is not helping matters, likely prolonging the
West Nile season here, said MacNeill. "The nighttime temperatures
have not been cold enough to shut down the mosquitoes," said
MacNeill. "I think we'll stay at risk at least until the end of this
month. But the good news is, we're drying up."
As many as 16 Pima County horses have been confirmed sick with West
Nile virus infection, mostly in the West Side areas of Tucson
Mountain Park and along the Ajo Way corridor. 4 of the stricken
horses have been euthanized. 15 of the horses were not vaccinated
against the virus, and one had gotten a single shot only a week
before showing symptoms. The equine vaccine requires 2 shots 2 weeks
apart to develop protection.

Colorado: Horses Hit Hard by West Nile Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
Some are skipping horse shows. Others are doling out more for
vaccines and vet bills at a time when their industry is struggling
amid a tough economy. Residents are coping with hundreds of cases of
West Nile virus infection, a mosquito-borne virus infection that has
hit more horses in Pennsylvania and Colorado than any other state
this year.
The overall impact on the state's $753 million industry has been
difficult to measure because costs have been absorbed by horse
owners, said Brian Kitchen, executive director of the Colorado Horse
Council. "It certainly had some negative impacts in that it has
affected people going to shows and people are a little concerned
about taking their horses to areas with mosquitoes," Kitchen said.
Almost 600 equine West Nile cases have been reported in Colorado,
including horses, mules, and donkeys, state health officials said. Of
the 127 horses tracked, 30 died or had to be euthanized. Most had not
been vaccinated, were older, or already sick.
The danger of new infections in Colorado from mosquito bites is over
for the season, health officials said. Mosquitoes that carry the
virus have switched from blood to nectar meals as they prepare for
winter. At least 2600 cases [now 3471] have been reported across the
nation, with the Rocky Mountain region absorbing most of the impact,
federal officials said.
Nationally, the economic impact has been felt mostly by ranches that
send horses to other countries to breed, said Amy Mann of the
American Horse Council in Washington. "As far as trade, we do have
some countries in South America -- Argentina and Brazil -- that
placed restrictions on horses that came from any region where West
Nile virus activity was reported, in any species," Mann said. "It's
generally one or 2 farms out of Florida or California or Texas.
You're talking about a relatively small number of horses, but a
pretty hefty impact on those farms," she said, noting that stud fees
can run from $500 to $1 million.
West Nile virus infection was first reported in the United States in
1999 and showed up in Colorado in 2002. Horses, like humans, get the
virus from infected mosquitoes. Equine symptoms include fever, lack
of coordination, weakness in hind limbs, and partial paralysis. Many
infected horses do not develop symptoms. Of the horses that do become
sick, about 33 percent die or are put to death, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Services. By the end of 2002, 380 equine cases were confirmed and 93
proved fatal in Colorado.
Experts believe the intensity of the outbreak in Colorado can be
blamed partly on weather: Drought, coupled with an unusually wet
spring and early summer, allowed mosquitoes to breed and helped the
virus spread. "It's the combination of a lot of different factors,
and I don't think anyone's smart enough to know precisely what the
right combination is," said Richard Bowen, a biomedical sciences
professor at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.
Wyeth, a pharmaceutical company based in Madison, N.J., has sold
about 200 000 doses of its West Nile vaccine in Colorado already in
2003, spokesman Doug Petkus said. At the end of 2002, about 150 000
doses had been sold statewide. In Colorado, the vaccine costs about
$50.
Calculating the number of West Nile cases can be misleading because
many horses go untested, New Mexico public health veterinarian Paul
Ettestad said. 430 cases have been confirmed in Pennsylvania, which
has edged out Colorado's 426 equine West Nile cases. New Mexico
ranked third with 370 cases. "This is probably just a fraction of
what's going on," Ettestad said. Both New Mexico and Colorado use the
number of cases as a reference to track where the virus has spread.

Texas: West Nile Encephalitis Reported in Stem Cell Recipients
--------------------------------------------------
In a new report [see: 15 Oct 2003 issue of Clin Infect Dis
2003;37:1044-1049], US researchers describe 2 patients who developed
fatal West Nile virus (WNV) infections after undergoing stem cell
transplantation. "To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
reported cases of WNV infection in recipients of hematopoietic stem
cell transplants," Dr. Chitra Hosing and colleagues, from the M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, stated.
2 factors may place stem cell recipients at high risk for symptomatic
WNV infection, the authors conclude. First, they typically receive
multiple blood products, which raises their risk of infection. And
second, the immunosuppression seen in such patients may raise the
risk of central nervous system disease once infected. The current
cases involved 2 older men with a history of acute myeloid leukemia
who underwent matched unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation at
the authors' institution. A common thread in both cases was the use
of immunosuppressants and the receipt of multiple blood products.
In the 1st case, a 58-year-old man with a history of relapsed acute
myeloid leukemia developed a fever and right shoulder weakness a few
days before transplantation. Although physical exam revealed upper
extremity weakness, MRI of the brain and right brachial plexus were
normal. Antibiotics were given, the patient defervesced, and
transplantation was performed on hospital day 7. One day after the
procedure, the patient's weakness spread to other extremities and the
fever returned. Initial lumbar tap and microbiologic studies failed
to yield a diagnosis. By day 10, the patient had become unresponsive.
Repeat lumbar tap on day 12 revealed the presence of WNV and MRI on
day 15 showed encephalitis. Despite aggressive treatment with
interferon, the patient's condition did not improve and he died on
day 27.
The 2nd case involved a 71-year-old man, also with AML, who had
recurring problems with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following
transplantation. 2 days after receiving high-dose IV corticosteroids
for GVHD the patient developed a fever and became progressively
weaker. Later he began experiencing seizures, but CT and EEG
performed at the time failed to reveal any abnormalities. As in the
1st case, this patient became severely obtunded. Serum samples
obtained on hospital day 2 revealed the presence of anti-WNV IgM
antibodies. Showing no neurologic improvement, life support was
withdrawn and the patient died on hospital day 7. Analysis of brain
tissue obtained at autopsy showed changes consistent with viral
encephalitis.
Although there are tests that can detect very small amounts of WNV in
biologic specimens, "the cost of screening the entire blood supply
may be prohibitive," the authors note. "An alternative option may be
to screen only the blood that is being given to severely
immunosuppressed patients."

[As of Wed 29 Oct 2003, in the USA only 4 states -- Hawaii, Alaska,
Nevada, and Oregon -- have remained entirely free of West Nile virus
infection of any animal species (apart from travel-related human
cases) since the appearance of the virus in North America.
The weekly counts of new human cases during the past 9 weeks have
been 414, 1046, 1214, 690, 1034, 646, 450, 429, and now 332; it is
clear that the outbreak is past its peak. The 3 western/midwestern
states of Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota have accounted for 60.6
percent (4674/7718) of the total number of confirmed human cases and
45.8 percent (76/166) percent of fatalities in 2003. - Mod.CP]
