The future of Montana's cattle industry, some say, is in the hands of
the federal government and a Bridger ranching couple. Ranchers and
livestock groups from the state and around the country are anxiously
watching negotiations between the herd owners and the U.S. Department
of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) over the couple's quarantined cattle.
In May [2007], 7 cows from their ranch tested positive for
brucellosis and Montana could lose its coveted brucellosis-free
status if the couple's herd isn't slaughtered within 60 days of that
discovery, which is 17 Jul 2007.
Concerns are mounting that a deal won't be reached in time. State
Senator Bob Story, [Republican] R-Park City, raised the issue at an
Environmental Quality Council meeting last week [2-8 Jul 2007], and
state Board of Livestock members peppered acting state veterinarian
Jeanne Rankin with questions during a conference call Tuesday [3 Jul
2007]. "We're looking at a timeline here, and the board needs to know
what steps to take if negotiations fall apart," board chairman
William Hedstrom told Rankin. Board members plan to meet again this
Wednesday [11 Jul 2007] for an update and to "take some kind of
action" if a deal isn't brokered, he said. The state's
brucellosis-free status is critical to its livestock industry. Losing
it would cost producers business in other states and subject them to
expensive testing and vaccination programs, possibly for years.
Brucellosis, which causes pregnant cows to abort their calves, was
widely eradicated from livestock last century but has persisted in
wildlife such as elk and bison. Recent outbreaks in Idaho and Wyoming
have cost livestock producers there millions of dollars. Montana is
now on probation for 2 years and will lose its brucellosis-free
status if any further cases turn up during that time. What's holding
up the Bridger cattle herd deal is a price for the animals.
The herd owners did not agree with the government's initial herd
appraisal, and commissioned their own estimation. The couple faxed an
offer to APHIS on Thursday [5 Jul 2007], but had not heard back from
the agency, said the owner's wife and her father, a rancher and state
lawmaker. APHIS spokeswoman, Larry Cooper, said officials were
reviewing the offer Friday [6 Jul 2007]. "It's all still up in the
air," Malcolm said. State and federal officials are still
investigating the source of the outbreak, but many suspect the elk
herds northeast of Yellowstone.

[I fear that this is a case of 'Montana Hold'em', to misuse a poker
phrase. In the terminal phase of brucellosis eradication it is
economically more sensible to slaughter out the last few reactor
herds than wend one's way through the slow interminable process of
herd retesting until everyone is convinced there are no covert
reactors left. Unfortunately, the Montana negotiations have gone
slower than optimum and so we have this last minute stare down. We
can only wait to see who folds. - Mod.MHJ]
