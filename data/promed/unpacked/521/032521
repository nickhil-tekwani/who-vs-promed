HFMD death toll climbs to 81 in Viet Nam
----------------------------------------
A health official said 96 percent of HFMD [Hand, foot and mouth
disease] fatalities in Viet Nam this year have been of children under
5 years of age. The death toll for HFMD has climbed to 81 among 32 588
cases reported in 52 cities and provinces, according to the Viet Nam
Administration of Preventive Medicine.

Tran Thanh Duong, the agency's deputy chief, told the Viet Nam News
Agency that fatalities have been reported in 17 cities and provinces,
with Ho Chi Minh City having the highest toll at 22, followed by the
provinces of Dong Nai, Binh Duong, Long An and Ba Ria-Vung Tau. He
added 96 percent of fatalities were of children under 5.

Duong's office has warned the disease may continue to spread to more
provinces and claim more lives in the coming months. The risks are
higher for children attending kindergartens, since the new school year
has begun, it said.

The Ministry of Health has asked the education sector to take active
measures to sterilize [decontaminate] kindergartens, day care centers
and schools to prevent the spread of the HFMD virus.

[Since the end of June 2011 the number of cases of HFMD in Viet Nam
has risen from around 23 000 to 32 588, and death toll has risen from
70 to 81.

It has been established previously (see ProMED-mail posts referenced
below) that human enterovirus 71 is the dominant HFMD-associated virus
circulating in Viet Nam currently. HFMD caused by this virus can
result in a more serious form of this common childhood disease leading
to paralysis, encephalitis or death. This year's outbreak is a sharp
increase from recent years. Since 2008, about 10 000 to 15 000 cases
were reported annually with about 20 to 30 children dying each year.
