Michigan has been hit particularly hard amid a series of ongoing outbreaks of hepatitis A which have affected several other states including Utah, Arizona, Kentucky, and California. California has experienced over 672 cases, with at least 430 requiring hospitalization and 21 resulting in death.

The CDC has stated that the outbreak in Michigan is unrelated to the one in California but that both outbreaks have been similar in terms of affected population. That is, primarily the homeless and those reporting drug use have been affected. From August 2016 to 23 Dec 2017 approximately 630 cases of hepatitis A were reported throughout the state of Michigan, concentrated in the southeastern portion of the state which includes the Detroit metropolitan area. More than 500 of these cases occurred in 2017 alone, giving Michigan the highest per capita rate of hepatitis A in the USA. Of those 630 cases, 517 have required hospitalization and 20 have resulted in death.

The death rate of those affected is approximately 3.2 percent and the hospitalization rate is approximately 82 percent. These rates are far beyond what has occurred in past outbreaks of hepatitis A. Between 2011 and 2016 there were 4 deaths determined to be caused by hepatitis A in the state, 3 in 2013, and 1 in 2016.

In a presentation to county commissioners, Midland County Health Director Mike Krecek stated that infected individuals do not typically die from hepatitis A. "People are dying from this and that is not normally the case with [hepatitis A]," Krecek said. "Usually that number is zero and we see a hospitalization rate of around 4 percent. This is a much stronger strain than we are accustomed to."

Health officials have not yet been able to determine why the current strain of the virus is particularly virulent, nor have they been able to identify the source of the outbreak -- either in Michigan or elsewhere nationwide. "The incubation period of at least 15 days makes it very hard to trace things back," Krecek noted. "If you suspect food, you have to think about what you ate 15 days ago, 16 days, 18 days. It's very challenging." [See moderator comments below].

Those considered at high risk for hepatitis A include the homeless or those in transient living, those with a substance abuse history, users of injectable or non-injectable drugs, those in close contact with someone who has the virus, individuals with multiple sex partners, and men having sex with men. People who have died from the disease tend to be older with a median age of 58 years old. But more and more individuals not fitting in the high-risk categories are becoming infected with the hepatitis A virus. Livingston County Medical Director Dr Don Lawrenchuk stated that many of those infected have just been exposed to the virus--whether through person to person contact or contaminated food or water.

As a result of the outbreak a number of counties have expanded clinics to increase the number of individuals receiving vaccinations. Over 1800 people were vaccinated in week between 12 and 19 Dec 2017 in Monroe county just south of the Detroit metro area.

A majority of Americans under the age of 20 have received the vaccine, which is highly effective and provides lifetime immunity, as a part of routine childhood immunizations. Health officials have expressed the greatest concern over those over the age of 20, as most likely have not gotten the vaccine and are thus at risk of getting the disease now as a result of the outbreak. However, the effort to vaccinate the most at-risk populations has been hindered by a nationwide shortage of the hepatitis A vaccine. Detroit Health Department Director Dr Joneigh Khaldun reported that the department has had to turn to purchasing vaccines from private vendors. This has only somewhat alleviated the problem as there is a limit to how many doses can be purchased. "[W]e've literally been everyday purchasing 400 [doses], our max," Khaldun told a conference call of health professional last week, according to Michigan Radio.

High-risk populations have been targeted for vaccination as well as Detroit city workers who routinely cross paths with the high-risk, or have the potential to contaminate water supplies or otherwise spread the disease. The vaccination effort has been expanded now to include the vaccination of food service workers.

In Detroit, city officials have denied that the high death rate has been a result of the hepatitis A outbreak. Khaldun has claimed that of the 8 deaths in Detroit, it cannot be stated that all 8 individuals died from hepatitis A. However, all 8 individuals were infected with the recent strain of hepatitis A, as well as the 12 other reported deaths throughout the state.

Khaldun also stated that mass sanitation efforts, like the sanitization of sidewalks in San Diego, are not worth conducting in Southeast Michigan because the high-risk population is more dispersed. In addition, Khaldun denied any connection between the mass water shutoffs that the city of Detroit has conducted over the last few years, and the spread of the disease. Earlier in 2017 in July, however, a panel of experts gathered at the Wayne State University (WSU) Law School in Detroit to call for a declaration of a public health emergency in the city. This was done after a study conducted by Henry Ford Hospital researchers examined samples from hospital patients with skin and soft tissue infections and water-borne bacterial infections. The study, which was performed by 3 Henry Ford researchers using block-level address data, analyzed 37 441 cases of water-borne illness in Detroit and compared those cases with Detroit addresses whose water was shut off during the same time period. It was found that patients diagnosed with skin and soft tissue diseases were 1.48 times more likely to live on a block that experienced water shutoffs. Despite denials about the conclusiveness of the study several doctors, educators, civil rights advocates and a city resident called for the declaration of a public health emergency.

"Water-related diseases are now occurring in Detroit as the result of water shutoffs," stated Dr Wendy Johnson, clinical assistant professor at the University of Washington, at the conference at WSU. "Access to clean and safe water is a basic human right that is essential from a public health standpoint to prevent infectious diseases. We have run out of time and solutions must be immediate." Johnson went on to explain that people without access to water tend to wash their hands less frequently and are, consequently, at higher risk of contagious diseases and water-borne illness, such as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ or MRSA. Those cut off from clean drinking water suffer more from dehydration, which puts diabetics and heart disease patients at higher risk of serious illness, she said.

[The Michigan epidemic of hepatitis A has continued to expand while the parallel one in Southern California, primarily in San Diego county, seems to be abating. This is likely to be, in part, related to more spill over of infection into MSMs (men who have sex with men) and food handlers and, in part, due to less of a change in the paradigm of prevention as occurred in San Diego. Both outbreaks are being fueled by difficulties in sanitation rather than difficulties in identifying a food vehicle. The Michigan outbreak is further complicated by the water shut offs in Detroit. Political issues between the Republican statehouse and the primarily Democratic Detroit area are also confounding variables. The need for changing preventive paradigms for infectious diseases in the 21st century will, no doubt, occur time and time again in a world beset by climate change and politicians with anti-science agendas. - Mod.LL]

http://detroit.cbslocal.com/2017/12/29/health-alert-2-cases-of-hepatitis-a-confirmed-at-monroe-county-tim-hortons/


The Monroe County Health Department is confirming a 2nd case of hepatitis A in a food worker at a Tim Hortons restaurant. Officials say anyone who consumed food or beverages at the Tim Hortons at 404 S. Monroe Street from 10 to 28 Dec 2017 may have been exposed to the virus. Symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, and yellow skin and eyes. Symptoms occur between 15 and 50 days after exposure and can last for several weeks to months and can occasionally be fatal.

Because a hepatitis A vaccine can prevent illness if it's given within 14 days of exposure, anyone who consumed products from the restaurant during the established time frame should still get vaccinated. The health department is working to vaccinate all employees and determine if there are more cases.

Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by a virus, which is shed in feces and is most commonly spread from person to person by unclean hands contaminated with feces.

To reduce the risk of hepatitis A:
- get the hepatitis A vaccine;
- wash hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing and eating food. Rub hands vigorously with soap and warm running water for at least 20 seconds;
- clean and disinfect all surface areas, especially while someone in the household or workplace has symptoms. Particular care needs to be taken with areas such as toilets, sinks, trash, door knobs, and faucet handles;
- do not prepare food if you have symptoms and refrain from food prep for at least three days after symptoms have ended;
- exclude ill food service workers from the establishment immediately until clearance from [the health department] is received.

The hepatitis A vaccine is available through some healthcare providers and many pharmacies. Call ahead to ensure your provider or pharmacy has the vaccine available. For those who live in Wayne County and do not have insurance coverage, Hepatitis A vaccine is available at the Wayne County Health Department Clinic located at 33030 Van Born Road in Wayne, Michigan. Macomb and Oakland County residents who are uninsured could call their local health department.

Vaccination is especially recommended for the following at-risk individuals:
- health care workers who have direct contact with patients;
- people who use injection and non-injection illegal drugs;
- people who participate in commercial exchange of sexual practices;
- people who are homeless or in transient living situations;
- people who are or have recently been incarcerated;
- close personal contacts (such as household, sexual) of hepatitis A patients;
- food handlers
- men who have sex with men;
- people with liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Persons with chronic liver disease have an elevated risk of death from liver failure;
- any person who wishes to be immune to hepatitis A;
- people who live, work, or recreate in SE Michigan and are concerned about getting hepatitis A.

[It appears that more food handlers are being reported to be infected with HAV in Michigan as compared to California. It seems past the time when all food handlers in the USA should be required to have received the HAV vaccine. Healthcare workers are required to receive a variety of vaccines, in part to protect them but also, to minimize risks to the hospitalized population. - Mod.LL

http://www.sltrib.com/news/health/2017/12/29/utahs-hepatitis-a-outbreak-soars-to-118-cases-but-health-officials-hope-vaccination-campaign-will-soon-halt-its-spread/


Utah's hepatitis A outbreak continues to grow, but health officials now say they hope an aggressive vaccination campaign will halt it by early spring [2018]. The Utah Department of Health reported this week there have been 118 cases since the outbreak first came to light last spring [2017] among Salt Lake City's homeless population. The tally includes 31 new cases in the past month.

But health officials say they could have the flare-up under control by March 2018, thanks to repeated outreach efforts in areas where the virus is centered. In addition, the state health department recently received a USD 248 000 grant from Intermountain Healthcare, allowing for the purchase of nearly 9000 more hepatitis vaccine doses from the CDC.

"The fact we're only seeing a few cases per week right now, it really speaks volumes to local health departments efforts to vaccinate these [people]," said Jeff Eason, a viral hepatitis epidemiologist with the Utah Department of Health. But Eason added that there continue to be "some really big challenges" reaching some homeless groups around Salt Lake County.

Utah is one of 3 hepatitis outbreaks around the country, along with California and Michigan. It's believed Utah's 1st outbreak-related case traveled here from California in May [2018]. In a normal year, the Beehive State sees fewer than 5 hepatitis A cases.

The viral disease, which inflames the liver, can result in fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and yellowing of the skin, but healthy people without drug addictions or other underlying health problems typically recover within weeks. In Utah, more than half of those infected have required hospitalization. Hepatitis A has spread through the Salt Lake valley's homeless population due to poor hygiene and unsanitary conditions, officials said. Outside Salt Lake County, the largest number of cases have been 25 in Utah County.

Utah health agencies have administered more than 10 500 vaccine doses so far, and Eason said that once caregivers give out a few thousand more, the virus will have few people to infect and should die off. "You'll ultimately get to a point where you vaccinate the vast majority of people in the at-risk category," said Tom Hudachko, a state health department spokesman. There are already some positive signs. Spokesman Nicholas Rupp said the Salt Lake County Health Department saw just one new case last week, though he warned the data was still provisional.

County health workers have administered vaccines at several area homeless shelters about 2 or 3 times a week of late, Rupp said. While March 2018 remains the goal to have the virus wiped out, he said, "it's too early to say if that's a realistic hope."

Intermountain Healthcare stepped in to buy more doses when local health agencies began to run low and the state was unable to secure emergency federal funding, said Mikelle Moore, Intermountain's senior vice president of community health. "We didn't want the state to go without having that [vaccine] supply," she said. The current supply should last about 3 months, Hudachko said -- ideally just long enough to get the problem under control.

While this outbreak is the largest Utah has seen in years, it pales in comparison to flare-ups in Michigan and California. More than 40 people have died in those states, with nearly 1000 more hospitalized. In California, officials in San Diego began opening industrial-sized tents in recent weeks to house the homeless and try to contain the outbreak.

Nobody has died thus far in Utah's outbreak, though the rate of hospitalization is similarly high.
