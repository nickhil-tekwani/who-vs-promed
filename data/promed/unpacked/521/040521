The Department of Agriculture confirmed 9 new cases of the H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) today including the 1st instance of the disease in Iowa. The disease has now reached 12 states since 1st appearing in the Pacific Northwest in January 2015.

8 of the 9 cases announced today by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) were in Minnesota, which leads the nation with 22 confirmed cases of the HPAI strain. All 9 of the newly confirmed outbreaks were on turkey farms in Minnesota and Iowa. According to USDA figures, almost 570 000 turkeys will be quarantined and depopulated as a result of today's announcements.

Both Minnesota and Iowa are in the Mississippi flyway where the disease 1st appeared in Minnesota in early March 2015. In the last week, Iowa, Wisconsin, and North Dakota have all had their 1st confirmed cases of the disease.

Aside from the 12 states with confirmed H5N2 cases, a case of a separate strain of H5N8 was detected in California in December 2014, bringing the total number of U.S. states with HPAI outbreaks to 13. As of today, there have been 43 cases of avian flu confirmed in the U.S.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk of HPAI H5 infection in humans to be low. No human infections have been detected at this time.

A duck at the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge in southern New Mexico, 1 of the nation's premier birding spots, has tested positive for a highly virulent strain of bird flu, state officials said Tuesday.

The case is the latest in a growing outbreak of bird flu, especially the highly contagious H5N2 strain affecting poultry in multiple states. While the strain can be deadly among waterfowl, poultry and other birds, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers the risk to people to be low.

The positive test results for the cinnamon teal duck from the wildlife refuge marks the first instance of the strain in New Mexico. The duck was 1 of nearly 200 tested in February and March 2015 as part of a federal effort to expand surveillance for bird flu.

Kerry Mower, a wildlife disease specialist with the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, said people need to take precautions to protect their domestic flocks from wild birds.

"We're trying to put the word out," he said. "The primary risk in New Mexico is to people who have a backyard poultry operation of some sort, whether it's eggs for the family or a few birds they sell."

Of primary concern are areas along migration paths, including the Rio Grande corridor, which stretches from South Texas into New Mexico and Colorado. Wildlife officials say although they're not certain, the duck that tested positive was likely passing through New Mexico.

The H5N2 bird flu has hit 8 more commercial turkey farms in Minnesota, bringing the total number of outbreaks to 22.

The latest incidents involve more than 500 000 turkeys in several counties. The number of birds affected now tallies more than 1.4 million, or about 3 percent of the state's annual turkey production.

Minnesota, the nation's largest turkey producer, is the epicenter of a nationwide outbreak of highly lethal bird flu that has hit about 15 states.

6 of the 8 new Minnesota cases are connected to turkey suppliers for Hormel Foods, owner of the well-known Jennie-O turkey brand. So far, 15 of the 22 Minnesota farms hit by the highly lethal flu are suppliers to Hormel, the nation's second largest turkey processor.

The biggest outbreak announced Tue 14 Apr 2015 hit 2 Hormel-affiliated farms in Swift County with a total of 314 000 birds. Only a minority of birds on a farm typically die from the flu, but all turkeys are killed out of precaution.

Other outbreaks reported Tuesday:

A 76 000 turkey flock in Stearns County, the 5th bird flu incident in that county.

A 56 000 turkey flock in Redwood County.

2 farms in Meeker County totaling 45 000 birds, the 2nd and 3rd incidents in that county.

A 30 000 turkey flock in Kandiyohi County, the 4th incident there.

A 21 000 turkey flock in Le Sueur County.

Animal health experts hope warmer weather will slow or stop the virus' spread. But with the flu ingrained in turkey country, the state will have to be on guard against the bird flu for the next 3-5 years, said Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association.

The bird flu is believed to be spread by waterfowl that carry the virus but don't get sick from it. It is of low risk to humans.

A bird flu outbreak affecting areas throughout the Midwest has been found in a commercial turkey flock in Buena Vista County, the 1st time the virus has been found in Iowa, the U.S. government said Tue 14 Apr 2015.

The Agriculture Department said the H5N2 avian influenza strain, which is capable of killing an entire flock within 48 hours, was found in a commercial flock of 27 000 turkeys.

The government did not specify the location of the farm or name the operation. Officials said the turkeys will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease and that none of the birds will enter the food system.

"We think all the things are in place to make sure this outbreak doesn't lead to other outbreaks around it," said Bill Northey, Iowa's secretary of agriculture. "We don't know what the disease's prevalence is in the wild population. It could show up at other places. But we don't know that it will, and we're hopeful that it doesn't," Northey said.

The facility and poultry facilities within 10 kilometers around it have been quarantined. State officials will test commercial and backyard poultry in the area for the disease.

Iowa State University economist David Swenson said the discovery in Buena Vista County is unlikely to have a major impact on the state through the loss of jobs, farm income for other producers or the consumer through higher poultry prices, unless the outbreak becomes more widespread.

"It's really important to the poultry industry, and one has to be careful not to minimize that," Swenson said. "But in terms of the state's economy noticing this, it probably won't unless this disease isn't stemmed."

Iowa ranks about 9th in the nation for turkey production, with about 11 million birds. Iowa is the nation's leading egg producer, with 60 million laying hens.

The lethal virus strain has been found in a number of states, including Arkansas, Wisconsin, Kansas, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota. More than 1.2 million birds have been killed by the disease or by authorities working to prevent it from spreading. No human infections have been found with the virus, USDA said.

Randy Olson, executive director of the Iowa Poultry Association, said it's not surprising the disease showed up in Iowa after being discovered in neighboring states.

He said the appearance of the disease should concern the entire agriculture industry. "Poultry is very important to the state, and the turkey industry and egg layers are major consumers of corn and soybeans," Olson said. No disease has been discovered in an Iowa egg-laying operation.

Samples from the turkey flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in Ames confirmed the findings.

Scientists and government officials believe the virus is being spread through migratory birds in the Mississippi flyway, where the strain previously has been identified. The birds are believed to transmit the illness through their droppings.

"We're not the 1st horse out of the gate on this," said Gretta Irwin, executive director of the Iowa Turkey Federation. The industry and its producers have plans in place in the event a facility is hit by the disease. Biosecurity efforts are high, said Irwin and Olson.

"The 2 things you can't control are Mother Nature and wild birds," Irwin said. "We've been watching and working and hoping and praying that it wouldn't happen, but it has."

Irwin said she's unsure about the exact location of the facility.

"Other farms close to the facility will be monitored," Irwin added, hopeful the outbreak will be an isolated occurrence.

She said the loss will be hard for the north Iowa farmer. That's true even though the federal government will reimburse for a portion of the cost.

"The main goal for farmers is to care for the livestock ... when you see your livestock sick and suffering that concludes in death, it's very hard for farmers."

[5] Wild birds
Date: 18 Mar 2015
Source: CIDRAP [edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2015/03/role-wild-birds-us-h5n2-outbreaks-questioned


[Moderator's Note: This article was published a month ago, in March 2015, so while it does not reflect current numbers regarding the outbreak, the question of the wild bird involvement is relevant. - Mod.TG]

The USDA reported that the Minnesota, Missouri, and Arkansas H5N2 isolates looked more than 99 percent similar to the [virus isolated from] Washington pintail ducks.

The notion that wild birds played a key role in bringing highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses from Asia to western North America and more recently to the Midwest has been implicit in government statements about recent outbreaks. But some wildlife disease experts are warning against jumping to easy conclusions.

The story goes back to November and December 2014, when an HPAI H5N2 virus struck several poultry farms in southern British Columbia. Those outbreaks triggered increased surveillance for avian flu in the United States, and a matching virus showed up in December 2014 in a wild northern pintail duck in northwestern Washington state. At the same time, a Eurasian strain of H5N8 virus was found in a captive gyrfalcon in the same area.

Subsequently the H5N2 virus surfaced in several backyard poultry flocks and wild birds in Oregon and Idaho as well as Washington. And [in April 2015] it popped up on a western Minnesota turkey farm and shortly afterward on 2 Missouri turkey farms, an Arkansas turkey farm, and a backyard flock in Kansas. The H5N2 strain is described as a product of mixing (reassortment) between the Eurasian H5N8 virus and native North American avian flu viruses.

In an 11 Mar 2015 announcement about the Arkansas outbreak, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said, "These virus strains can travel in wild birds without them appearing sick. People should avoid contact with sick/dead poultry or wildlife."

Last week the USDA reported that the Minnesota, Missouri, and Arkansas H5N2 isolates looked more than 99 percent similar to the Washington pintail duck virus, based on partial genetic sequencing of the virus's hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. The apparent implication was that migratory birds may have brought the virus to those states.

But not so fast, say experts like David Stallknecht, PhD, of the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine, and Michele Carstensen, PhD, wildlife health program supervisor in the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR). They point out, among other things, that migratory birds don't migrate from west to east or from north to south in late winter.

"This could all have been from wild birds -- nobody can say it's impossible," said Stallknecht. "But we do need some proof. . . . People seem to be willing to accept things without a whole lot of proof."

He said it is unknown how the H5N8 strain that gave rise to H5N2 reached North America. Noting that the H5N2 outbreaks in British Columbia marked the "index case" or 1st appearance of the virus, he said, "How much proof do we have of wild bird involvement with that virus in North America? None."

Referring to the mixing of H5N8 with North American viruses, he said, "Why do we make the jump to wild ducks to explain this? Reassortment could also occur in a backyard flock of domestic ducks after a more direct introduction [of H5N8] via people." He suggested that travelers could possibly have brought the virus to Canada from Asia.

He cautioned that this is "pure speculation," but added that the idea that wild birds introduced the parental H5N8 virus to North America is also speculative. "It is based on circumstantial evidence that is rapidly becoming accepted dogma."

Carstensen said the notion that wild birds could have brought the H5N2 virus from Minnesota to Missouri is "beyond me. . . . They [migratory birds] go from south to north this time of year." Arkansas and Kansas, on the other hand, are close enough to migratory-bird wintering grounds to make a connection with wild birds more plausible, she added.

There could be "totally different causes" for the outbreaks in Minnesota and the more southerly states, Carstensen suggested.

She and her colleagues have been testing fecal samples from wild birds found near the site of the outbreak in western Minnesota. A total of 148 samples, in 3 batches, have been tested for the presence of any avian flu virus. Only 2, both from mallards, tested positive, but the viral subtypes were not determined, she reported today. The samples have been sent to a USDA lab for the subtype determination.

If the viruses turn out to be H5 or H7 strains, their pathogenicity will be determined, which would take several weeks, Carstensen said. She noted that a number of H5 and H7 viruses were found in Minnesota wild birds in recent years, but they were all of low pathogenicity.

Even if wild birds did bring the H5N2 virus to Minnesota, she said, "It still has to get from the birds to the farm. The birds don't go there; it would have to be people or vehicles. The farm doesn't have any reports of waterfowl there at all."

Stallknecht said that whether the source of the virus was wild birds or human activity makes no difference in how to respond to and control the virus, but it does make a difference in other ways.

"Biosecurity is everything now, regardless of the source," he said via e-mail. "With regard to future risks for introductions of exotic viruses (flu or otherwise), however, it might be nice to know what really happened here."

[The update on numbers provides a good indication that this disease is spreading extremely rapidly. Please see the map at https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?hl=en&mid=zv94AJqgUct4.kB0Jt6F7NlIM

The rapid climb in infected premises and the number of birds brings into focus the possibility that wild birds may not be the link they were originally believed to be.

While the New Mexico case is a long way from Minnesota, it may herald more to come (though we hope not).

However, the 3rd article calls into question the poultry processing plants. These outbreaks seem to have something of a cluster around them. This can also be seen on the link provided in this comment.
