[2] Ebola infections dropping in West Africa, WHO says
Date: Fri 23 Jan 2015

The number of people falling victim to the Ebola virus in West Africa has fallen to the lowest level in months, the World Health Organization said on Friday [23 Jan 2015], but dwindling funds and a looming rainy season threaten to hamper efforts to control the disease.

More than 8668 [suspected, probable and confirmed] people have died in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, which 1st surfaced in Guinea more than a year ago. But the 3 worst-affected countries -- Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- have now recorded falling numbers of new cases for 4 successive weeks, Dr. Bruce Aylward, the health organization's assistant director general, told reporters in Geneva.

Liberia, which was struggling with more than 300 new cases a week in August and September [2014], recorded only 8 new cases in the week ending 18 Jan 2015, the organization reported. In Sierra Leone, where the infection rate is now highest, there were 118 new cases reported in that week, compared with 184 in the previous week and 248 in the week before that.

Speaking just after a visit to the region, Dr. Aylward said on Friday [23 Jan 2015] that the "really substantial reduction" in new cases was a direct result of last fall's [2014] vast buildup of resources for fighting the epidemic. "This is the 1st time that the countries were in a position to stop Ebola," he said.

President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone announced on Friday that the country was lifting the travel restrictions that it had imposed in an effort to contain the virus. "Victory is in sight," Mr. Koroma said. The restrictions, covering roughly half of the country's 6 million people, were part of a state of emergency declared last July [2014].

The health organization declared on Sunday [19 Jan 2915] that another West African nation, Mali, was free of Ebola after going 42 days -- twice the disease's incubation period -- without any new cases being detected. The appearance of the disease in Mali last year [2014] had underscored the danger of the virus spreading to neighboring countries through travel and trade.

[3] Why the Ebola epidemic is less devastating than predicted
Date: Thu 22 Jan 2014

Why the Ebola epidemic is (so far) less devastating than scientists predicted
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The havoc that Ebola has wreaked so far in West Africa cannot be understated. With a total of 21 200 people [now nearly 21 800] infected since March 2014, the disease is shredding the social fabric of Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, leaving 8400 [now more than 8600] dead. People live in fear, afraid to shake others' hands. Survivors are shunned, and those suspected of carrying the disease are being physically assaulted in some regions. Some schools have been closed, and economies have been ravaged.

Yet last fall [2014], many scientists predicted that the epidemic would be raging out of control by now. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] estimated that, in the worst case scenario, a total of 1.4 million West Africans would be infected by mid-January 2015. Other models from other teams predicted hundreds of thousands of Ebola cases by now. The latest report from WHO suggests that the rate of new cases is slowing down, and although the deadliest Ebola epidemic in history is far from finished, the worst of it may be behind us. That's great news! But why were the models so far off?

The CDC study, published in September [2014], only included data up until the end of August [2014]. At that time, the epidemic was growing quickly, and very few governments and aid organizations seemed to be stepping up to help. "The key part to remember is that we make projections based on the assumption that no further interventions and no further changes in human behavior will take place," says Martin Meltzer, who led the CDC study. "We very much hoped that we would be wrong." Scientists' predictions of calamity weren't unreasonable, says Colin Brown, who studies infectious diseases at King's College London and works closely with hospitals in Sierra Leone. "The models showed what could happen if there was a lack of international effort. We really don't know what would have happened if the world hadn't stepped up." ... -- more

[4] Missing data: request for information
Date: Fri 23 Jan 2015
From: Roger Feldman, MD <promedrf@gmail.com> [edited]


In at least one of the earlier Ebola outbreaks, serology surveys suggested that Ebola infections without illness had occurred. Subsequently, a 2006 serosurvey concerning Lassa fever (see ref. below) in Sierra Leone suggested there was a background population level of Ebola sera positivity, years before the present outbreak. The unknown presence of individuals seropositive for Ebola may help explain the observations that some people during the present outbreak, while clearly at risk of Ebola, have remained well. For example, is this the explanation of the absence of illness in the household contacts of TED, since 2 of the nurses caring for him became ill, even while using protective clothing, when no such thing occurred in his household, where no illness occurred after follow-up for 21 days? Better understanding of this question will occur when survey of antibodies against Ebola are done in villages without cases, with few cases, and many cases, and studies in [different] age groups, and gender groups.

Since December 2013, reporting of the progress of the west African Ebola epidemic has focused on the number of Ebola cases and number of Ebola-related deaths, every day, month after month, always acknowledging the uncertainties associated with reporting by village, region, and country. The emphasis on this restricted information is uncommon, as for other infectious disease outbreaks, age, gender, family size, number of multiple cases in a family, among other details is frequently reported, even for a small outbreak. The reporting of this major and widespread outbreak has been minimal, possibly because the health infrastructure was variable and uncertain. Reporting focused on only a few things, even though what was known, at least for some villages, regions or countries, was more than just cases and deaths. However, this characteristic of reporting has continued without change.

But more is known about the number of people in a village, about the number of families in a village, and about the number of cases in a family. We have heard, anecdotally, of many families with more than one case, and in some families, many cases. But nothing about how many families had no cases. As a result, even today, the frequency, starting from zero, of cases in each family in a village, or of families in a region or district, has not been used to report or describe a rate, by family, or of families in a region, or district, or tribal group, that is, the percent of individuals in a family who were cases. It would be a way to show the percent of families with no cases.

There may also be a problem concerning significant exposure and resulting disease severity. We do not know whether there is some difference in death rates when comparing the rates of deaths from cases in those who attended funerals and the rates of deaths from cases whose infection and illness occurred without attending funerals. Are the highest death rates those in people who attended funerals?

All in all, the public reporting of this infectious disease has been extremely limited, while much information must have been collected, and may simply be awaiting analysis. It is time that these "missing data" are allowed to help everyone understand more about this outbreak, and help people in villages, regions, districts do what may help them avoid those things that put them at risk. If local people understand where the risks for them and their families are highest, using details that put them and their families and villages first in the analysis, all of us will expand our understanding of this outbreak, and better understand those things that need to be done.

[Some of the questions that need addressing through studies have been suggested by Roger Feldman MD in [4] above. Some additional questions that remain unanswered are:

- Were the members of the Liberian household in Dallas, Texas, USA, who were exposed over days to the infected diarrhea and vomit (and other secretions) of the unfortunate case, TED, never infected, or do they have antibodies showing they were all infected in spite of showing no symptoms?

- Does the unfortunate Indian citizen who is an Ebola survivor and being held under indefinite quarantine at Delhi airport have live virus in his semen, or only non-infectious RNA?

- We know dogs in Gabon got infected with ebolavirus by eating wild animals found dead and entrails of bushmeat, and recovered (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/11/3/pdfs/04-0981.pdf), but we don't know if they show symptoms, or clear the virus in 21 days like humans (and what about their post-infection semen?).

The answers to these questions would advance our understanding of Ebola epidemiology. - Mod.JW]
