For the 1st time, 2 Cheboygan County deer tested positive for bovine
tuberculosis [TB] during the 2010 tests.

"We had a couple of positive deer in Cheboygan County," said Steve
Schmitt, Department of Natural Resources lead wildlife veterinarian.
"That's the 1st time we've actually tested positive deer in Cheboygan,
but we've suspected some positive deer were there."
