Rabies continues striking; a cow suspected to be hit in Western Galilee
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the sharp rise in the number
of rabies cases among animals -- 36 cases since the beginning of the
current year [2009]. The last case was discovered in a cattle barn, in
Bustan Hagalil, Western Galilee; the cow's owners had to be vaccinated
[post exposure] and additional precautionary measures taken. The cow, which
died of an unknown illness, was transferred to the central animal-cadaver
destruction facility and was incinerated there without being sampled.
Later, the veterinary practitioner got the details of her clinical signs
and the suspicion for possible rabies was raised and reported to the
veterinary district office. "Because of the seriousness of rabies, the
Ministry of Agriculture's District Veterinary Officer decided to treat the
incident as a case of rabies. A message was forwarded to the Ministry of
Health, which decided, that due to the serious life-threatening risk posed
by the disease, the exposed people would be treated although the case
remained suspected, obviously not confirmed. The local authority decided on
other measures, to vaccinate animals in the region," said the Ministry of
Agriculture.

According to Ministry of Agriculture's information, a steep rise in the
number of rabies cases in animals has been recorded in recent months,
becoming an "almost daily" event. Since the beginning of this year [2009],
36 rabies cases have been detected in animals, 22 of them in dogs, mostly
in the Galilee and Golan Heights. This compares with only 12 cases during
2008, 15 cases in 2005 and 9 in 2006 [total annual numbers).

The last published case involved an infected donkey in the village
Sedot-Micha, near Bet-Shemesh (Jerusalem district; see item 2 below -
Mod.AS]. Last month [September 2009], 9 people were bitten during one night
by infected jackals in the Afula-Nazareth area [northern Israel].

Fear of rabies in the mountains of Jerusalem; infected donkey discovered
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A rabies outbreak is feared in the village Sedot-Micha, near Jerusalem. The
Hadassah Hospital, Ein-Karem [Jerusalem] said tonight (Fri 9 Oct 2009] that
during the last 3 days, 7 people from the vicinity of the village have been
vaccinated, after one of them was bitten by a donkey, which later tested
positive for rabies. The hospital warned that the animal that had infected
the donkey, probably a dog or a fox, was not found.

The suspicion about rabies occurred after a group of boys found 3 female
donkeys [jennets] roaming the hills of Jerusalem and brought them to the a
school-farm nearby the village Sedot Micha. One of the boys was bitten by a
donkey and was taken to the hospital. The donkey was transferred to the
Veterinary Service and found positive [for rabies].

"From that moment, we had to vaccinate everyone who came into contact with
the sick animal, since rabies is transferred through the saliva. This is a
significant problem since we do not know how the donkey got infected," YNET
was told by the head of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Hadassah
Ein Kerem, Professor Kobi Assaf.

"The donkey was found in a central location, among many settlements such as
Beit Shemesh, Netiv HaLamed he, Zoreah, Zechariah village, Aviezer, Tirosh
Geffen, Srigim, Zafririm, and Givat-Yeshayahu. We call upon the public not
to tie dogs in the yard but to keep them indoors. Those responsible for
health and security in each community should invite the veterinary service
to come and look for stray animals. Certainly, anyone bitten or exposed to
a stray dog, must come to be examined at the hospital or health office.
This is great public concern."

According to Professor Assaf, every year 700 to 900 bitten persons attend
the hospital, of which at least 300 get [post exposure] vaccinations
against rabies.

[An updated, 2009 map and table of rabies cases in Israel is available at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2009.html>. Since our
previous report on rabies in Israel, dated 27 Aug 2009, 10 additional cases
in animals have been laboratory confirmed; 2009 has become, rabies-wise,
the worst since 2003. The implementation of the fox-targeted oral
vaccination programme (ORV), initially (1998) on a limited scale and later
(2003) on a larger one, led eventually to a dramatic fall in the number of
cases, the disease practically disappearing from most parts of the country,
with a few cases sporadically appearing in the north east (Syrian border
areas).

Between 1979 and 2000, foxes constituted the main reservoir of rabies in
Israel. During 2004-2007, the biological and molecular characterization of
the rabies isolates showed that stray dogs emerged as the main animal
reservoir in Northern Israel while lower numbers of cases were reported in
domestic animals. The virus isolates from foxes and dogs differed, in their
molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct separate lineages. The
transition from fox-mediated rabies to dog-mediated rabies is of great
concern to public health because of the close contact between dogs and the
human population (see reference below).

The case in a donkey in the Judean hills (central Israel) described above,
may be indicative of returning cases in wildlife, in spite of continuing
oral vaccination; this is in need of explanation. Until 2005, 2 annual
aerial bait dispersion campaigns were carried out, in the spring and in the
fall. During the last 4 years, 2006-2009, the project included only one
annual aerial dispersion campaign, in the fall; 350 000 baits are dispersed
annually, covering an area of 20 000 sq/km (approx 7700 sq/mi). A map,
showing the distribution of oral vaccine baits for foxes and jackals since
2004, is available at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2004-2011.html>.
