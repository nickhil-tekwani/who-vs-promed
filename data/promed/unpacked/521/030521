The health authorities in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula have
reported a new outbreak of cholera, with at least 40 cases notified so far,
but no deaths, reports the 10 Jul 2002 issue of the Maputo daily paper
"Noticias."
The new outbreak began the week before, and cases were reported from the
districts of Nacala-a-Velha and Namapa. The health authorities have
reopened cholera treatment centers that had been closed earlier in the
year, and have redoubled their efforts in awareness campaigns among the
residents to prevent the spread of the epidemic. This new surge is blamed
on the lack of an adequate supply of clean drinking water and the poor
sanitation conditions.
Meanwhile, in neighboring Cabo Delgado province, also hit by the epidemic,
73 deaths from cholera have been reported, out of the 4004 cases diagnosed
since early January 2002.
However, the authorities in Cabo Delgado say that the epidemic there is now
subsiding, and the situation is stabilizing, with no cases reported during
the last 2 weeks in the districts of Macomia and Mocimboa da Praia, where
most of the deaths occurred.
The provincial health directorate has confirmed the suspicions that cholera
had now reached Mueda district. Since 26 Jun 2002, there have been 210
known cases in Mueda, with 7 deaths.
The chief of the Cabo Delgado Community Health department, Henrique Pinto
Antonio, said that another affected district is Muidumbe, with 104 cases
and 3 deaths reported since 28 Jun 2002. "These are areas where the
situation still calls for a special attention, since we still have between
6 and 8 new cases a day," he said.
But he expressed hope that the situation there will soon come under control
thanks to the preventive measures taken by the health authorities and the
public awareness campaigns.

(Week ending 30 Jun 2002)

This week recorded a slight increase in cholera cases compared to last
week. A total of 31 cases with 1 death were reported as compared to 22
cases with 1 death recorded last week. The cases were in Masindi (24 cases
with 1 death) and Nebbi (7 cases). The other districts that had cholera in
June 2002 but reported no new cases in the week are Kabarole, Hoima,
Rukungiri, and Bundibugyo.
Dysentery cases were recorded in 53 districts. The districts with the
highest number of cases included Arua (66), Tororo (52 cases with 1 death),
Moroto (52), Kisoro (45), Mbale (36 cases with 1 death), Bundibugyo (31),
Kotido (25), Kyenjojo (24), Lira (24), Masaka (22 cases with 1 death) and
Gulu (22). Out of the 9 specimens samples received from Kalangala and
analysed by the Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL), 7 yielded
_Shigella dysenteriae_ type 1 on culture. The organism was sensitive to
nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin but resistant to tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. All
District Health Teams are encouraged to regularly submit samples from
suspected cases to CPHL for isolation of causative organisms and
determination of the antibiotic sensitivity patterns.
[We'd like to thank Dr. Kamugisha for sharing the Ugandan Ministry of
Health Weekly Epidemiologic Newsletter with ProMED-mail. According to the
newsletter, the information in this issue represents reporting from 96
percent of the reporting districts in the country. It is nice to have
information on the geographic extent of disease activity in addition to the
laboratory results confirming the dysentery cases as _Shigella dysenteriae_
type 1, with the antibiotic sensitivity profiles. The Ministry of Health is
to be commended for the excellent effort on this newsletter; a model for
many countries to follow. - Mod.MPP]

Cholera Confirmed in Afghan Capital
-------------------------------
So far 3 people have been diagnosed with cholera in the Afghan capital, and
there were fears the infectious waterborne disease could spread, the World
Health Organization said on 14 Jul 2002.
Some 6000 people have been hospitalized in the past 3 weeks as Kabul
experienced an outbreak of diarrhea-related illnesses, said WHO spokeswoman
Loretta Hieber Girardet, and 3 people have died of severe dehydration. [It
is presumed that the 6000 includes a variety of enteric causes of diarrhea.
-Mod.LL]
Afghan health authorities and WHO have started "immediate implementation of
epidemic prevention measures throughout Kabul" to stop cholera and related
diseases from spreading, she said. Among these measures are water
purification and public education.
"Cholera can spread like wildfire if control measures are not urgently
implemented," Girardet said. "There are severe water and sanitation
problems in Kabul."
Diarrhea kills an estimated 85 000 children per year in Afghanistan and is
considered to be the impoverished country's major health risk, Girardet said.

10 die in Bihar due to diarrhea
---------------------
At least 10 people, including 3 children, have died of diarrhea in Bihar's
Muzaffarpur district in the last 3 days. More than 50 people have been
admitted to the local government-run hospital.
Sources in the district health office said diarrhea is rampant in the
flood-ravaged areas of the district. "At least 4 blocks of the district
have been hit by diarrhea," the sources added. The officials admitted that
situation may become alarming if the district administration does not move
quickly to stop the spread of the disease.
The civil surgeon, Dr Jagdish Singh, has also asked the administration for
making immediate arrangements for the mixing of bleaching powder in
drinking water being supplied through taps. An epidemic cell has also been
opened in the district hospital to tackle the situation.
