The number of babies born with syphilis has shot up, and it's taking a toll. Of the 458 babies born last year [2014] with syphilis, 33 were stillborn or died shortly after birth. From 2012 to 2014, was a 38 percent increase in cases of congenital syphilis. The spike reverses a previously falling trend in the rates of babies with syphilis from 2008 to 2012, according to a report released [Thu 12 Nov 2015] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [1].

As rates of new syphilis infections rise and fall, rates of fetal and congenital syphilis tend to follow suite, says Virginia Bowen, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and lead author on the study. If a pregnant woman carries the bacteria, syphilis can infect the unborn fetus. When that happens, a lot of things can go awry. "Up to 40 percent of babies will die in utero or shortly after delivery," Bowen says. "Or they might have severe illness like blindness or deafness or other types of damage."

It's hard to know the reason behind the recent surge in syphilis cases, Bowen says. "The only thing I can say is syphilis is going up right now across the board," she says. "From 2013 to 2014, we are seeing syphilis going up everywhere, including among the women, and we don't have the answers as to why."

The rising rates in congenital syphilis might betray a larger problem among health care for women and pregnant women, Bowen says. "There are a lot of barriers to getting into the door at the prenatal care provider. That could be related to insurance status, [stigma], or discrimination." If women aren't getting adequate prenatal care, then they can't be screened for syphilis.

Access to care can be particularly hard for certain populations, says Dr Martha Rac, a maternal-fetal medicine physician at Ben Taub Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved with the study. "African-American women are more disproportionately affected by syphilis than any other race," she says. And 57 percent of children with congenital syphilis were born to African-American women.

Lack of prenatal care is probably the greatest contributor to the upturn in congenital syphilis, Rac says. "It seems to be the common theme that women having congenitally infected babies overwhelmingly have, if any, late, poor prenatal care. That is a big area which can be targeted from a public health standpoint."

Some states have been harder hit than others. California went from 35 cases in 2012 to 99 in 2014, while Texas continued to see a slight decline in the overall number of babies born with syphilis. "In April [2015], I designated Fresno County as an area of high syphilis, so providers are required to screen for syphilis 3 times during pregnancy," says Dr Ken Bird, health officer for the Fresno County Department of Public Health.

There are states that have free health coverage for pregnant women. "In California, every pregnant female has coverage for prenatal care [through the Medi-Cal program]. Many don't realize that, and they're not sure how to access that care," Bird says. Other states may cover prenatal visits through state Children's Health Insurance Programs.

Syphilis is a difficult disease to diagnose, Bowen says. Many people become asymptomatic after the 1st lesions or rashes appear, but can still pass the infection on to their unborn children. But as long as the infection is caught early enough, a simple course of antibiotics is enough to ensure a healthy baby. "Of the 458 cases we had last year [2014], every single one of them is considered preventable," she says.

[The following is the discussion section of the MMWR report (ref 1 above) that the news report referred to:

"Discussion
-----------
"The rate of CS [congenital syphilis] in the United States reached a low of 8.4 cases per 100 000 live births in 2012, after 4 years of steady decline. However, during 2012-2014, the national CS rate increased 38 percent. This rapid increase in the CS rate coincided with a 22 percent national increase in the rate of P&S [primary and secondary] syphilis among women during the same period.

"In the United States, a case of CS is a sentinel event reflecting numerous missed opportunities for prevention within public health and health care systems (7). There are 2 major opportunities to prevent CS: primary prevention of syphilis among women of reproductive age and men who have sex with women, and prevention of mother-to-infant transmission among pregnant women already infected with syphilis.

"Preventing syphilis among women and their male partners requires that sexually transmitted diseases (STD) prevention programs quickly identify and respond to increases in syphilis cases among women and men who have sex with women in their jurisdictions. CS cases and cases of syphilis among women should be reported to the local health department within 24 hours of diagnosis, and STD programs should review local syphilis case data each week to detect increases in CS cases or cases of syphilis among women. In addition, CS cases should be reported to CDC within 1 month of diagnosis. STD programs should prioritize cases of infectious syphilis among women of reproductive age and their male sex partners for case investigation and partner services to reduce transmission and infection in these populations. STD programs might also consider enhancing surveillance efforts by determining pregnancy status on all reported syphilis cases in women and by monitoring the screening and treatment practices among prenatal care providers in communities at highest risk for delivering an infant with CS.

"Mother-to-infant transmission of syphilis can be prevented or mother-to-infant transmission that has already occurred can be treated when maternal syphilis is detected, and benzathine penicillin G appropriate for the mother's stage of infection [for mothers with primary, secondary, or early latent syphilis, a single intramuscular dose of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G; for mothers with late latent syphilis, 7.2 million units of benzathine penicillin G, administered as 3 intramuscular doses of 2.4 million units each at one-week intervals] is initiated 30 or more days before delivery (3). CDC recommends that all pregnant women be screened for syphilis at their first prenatal visit (3). Women at increased risk for syphilis and women living in high-morbidity geographic areas should also be screened at the beginning of their third trimester and again at delivery.** When access to prenatal care is not optimal, rapid plasma reagin [RPR] screening should be performed at the time that a pregnancy is confirmed (performed onsite by using a rapid plasma reagin card test, if possible, and the woman treated as necessary). Newborn infants should not be discharged from the hospital unless the syphilis serologic status of the mother has been determined at least one time during pregnancy and preferably again at delivery if the mother is determined to be at increased risk. Any woman who delivers a stillborn infant should be tested for syphilis.

"A substantial percentage of CS cases are attributable to a lack of prenatal care; even among those receiving some prenatal care, the detection and treatment of maternal syphilis often occurs too late to prevent CS. Health departments, in partnership with prenatal care providers and other local organizations, should work together to address barriers to obtaining early and adequate prenatal care for the majority of vulnerable pregnant women. Women who are uninsured or underinsured and women with substance use issues have been found to be at increased risk for receiving inadequate or no prenatal care, placing them at increased risk for CS (8,9).

"The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, shortcomings in screening practices (e.g., inconsistent syphilis testing of mothers with stillborn infants) or underreporting can lead to missed cases (10). Second, this analysis only stratified data at the regional and state levels; the observations reported here might not reflect more local (e.g., county- or city-level) epidemiology. Third, the use of 2013 natality data in the calculation of CS rates might overestimate the rate of CS by a limited amount; preliminary data indicate that births might have increased slightly in the United States during 2013-2014.

"Although the United States experienced an overall decline in the rate of CS during 2008-2012, the rate increased substantially during 2012-2014, to the highest level since 2001. Racial and ethnic disparities persist, and CS prevention in the public health and health care sectors remains paramount. Addressing CS will depend upon health care providers and STD programs being aware of infectious syphilis among women of reproductive age and men who have sex with women in their jurisdictions; reporting cases of CS and cases of syphilis among women of reproductive age and men who have sex with women in a timely fashion; prioritizing STD partner services for syphilis cases among women of reproductive age and their sex partners; instituting more thorough prenatal screening practices when warranted; ensuring timely treatment of identified cases with benzathine penicillin G; and removing the barriers to timely and high quality prenatal care."

There is an on-going epidemic of the primary and secondary syphilis in men who have sex with men (MSM). If some of the increasing numbers of MSM also have unprotected sex with wives and girlfriends, there may be a spillover that may lead to a rising incidence of syphilis in women and congenital syphilis. - Mod.ML
