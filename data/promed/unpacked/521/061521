The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries announced today [19 Oct
2009] the start of treatment of almond trees in the east of Mallorca.
Over 200 hectares [approx 500 acres] of this crop will be treated
with a 'preventative' fungicide. The almond trees in the area of Son
Carrio are affected by "fungi" and the Ministry considers it possible
for some of the trees to recover from the outbreak.

The affected trees will be treated with copper oxychloride, a
preventative fungicide, during a period of about 2 weeks. Later, in
the spring [2010], new fungicide treatments will be applied as well
as fertiliser to improve the health of the trees and help them to recover.

In addition to the phytosanitary measures, the Ministry announced
subsidies of 600 000 Euros [approx USD 900 000] to remove dead trees
and plant new ones. Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Merce
Amer, said: "This is a very sensitive issue that affects trees that
are much more than a crop, they are part of our landscape."

[Many fungi can affect almonds, but it is not clear if a specific
disease has been identified in the Balearic Islands or if fungi are
only assumed to be involved. An insect pest has also been reported to
affect almond in the area (see link below) and there may be some
confusion, but it is also possible that the insects are involved in
spreading fungal pathogens.

If the problems are indeed caused by fungi, it is likely that the
treatment programme outlined above will improve the situation. Copper
compounds have general fungicidal and bactericidal properties and are
amongst the oldest chemicals used for crop protection.
