A bout of Asian soybean rust left more than 20 soybean seed growers near
Tampico, Mexico, unexpectedly dealing with the disease. About 320 hectares,
or 650 acres, were affected, resulting in defoliation and potential large
yield losses.
ASR infections began in January 2006 but became increasingly noticeable in
March and April. "It caught these particular growers by surprise, and it
hit them pretty hard," said Dr. Marty Wiglesworth, Syngenta technical brand
manager, fungicides.
Seed beans are generally harvested at the end of April into early May, so
the majority of the affected acres should be out of the ground. Mexican
growers will begin planting more soybeans closer to the Texas border in
late May. According to Wiglesworth, the time gap between harvesting the
seed beans and planting additional soybeans may be good news for U.S.
soybean growers.
"We cannot foresee whether the impact on the U.S. crop will be minimal. We
don't know at this point," Wiglesworth said. "It depends on whether there
are nearby patches of volunteer soybeans or kudzu for ASR to live on until
the newly planted Mexican crop becomes susceptible at R1. Scouting fields
is the prudent thing to do."
Potentially, Wiglesworth said ASR could be equated to the wheat rust that
comes yearly out of Mexico and Texas into the Midwest. "If ASR establishes
itself on a regular basis in Mexico, one possibility is that it could
follow a very similar pathway as wheat rust. Overwintering ASR present in
Florida and Georgia has a harder time moving directly into the Midwest
unless there are unusual weather patterns, but Mexico could serve as a more
consistent source into the Midwest. At this time, however, experts believe
the current risk for rust in east Texas is low."
There are currently no effective fungicides labeled for use in Mexico for
Asian Soybean Rust control, although Syngenta and other agrichemical
companies are currently pursuing emergency exemptions for rust specific
fungicides.

[The crop plant soybean, _Glycine max_, develops symptoms of the disease
soybean rust (ASR), when infected by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_,
Asian strain.
ASR was found in Mexico for the 1st time on soybean leaves at the end of
October 2005 in Tamuin, State of San Luis Potosi, and in Altamira, State of
Tamaulipas, Mexico (20060219.0546). This new significant outbreak of ASR
in the 2006 soybean crop was found near the city of Tampico, which is east
and south of these 2 previous locations, respectively. In previous updates
on soybean rust in the USA (e.g. 20060226.0622) the possibility of Mexico
becoming a major source of inoculum on an annual basis at the beginning of
the ASR season has been voiced. Dr. Marty Wiglesworth mentions the same
concern in this article. ASR has not been reported on newly planted
soybeans in the USA to date (25 May 2006) in the 2006 crop season. Spores
of the fungal pathogen were trapped in Texas this week but the question of
the source was not addressed (see link). Any contribution of spores from
the confirmed and other as yet unreported infections in Mexico may need to
evaluated.
This article notes that the Mexican soybean crop nearest to the Texas
border may escape infection from the infected plants in Tampico, which have
now been harvested.
