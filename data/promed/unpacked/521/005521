Farmers in Usilampatti area are perturbed by the death of cows from a
mystery disease. Milch animal rearing is carried out on a large scale in
Usilampatti area along with agriculture. The straw and grass from the
fields serve as fodder for the milch animals. These animals also ensure a
steady income for the farmers from sale of milk. However, recently, the
animals have been dying from some unidentified disease.
Some cows that had been taken for grazing at Rengasamipatti and Ammamuthu
were found dead. Farmers say that the cows start shivering and within a few
minutes, die. Veterinary surgeons have visited these villages and injected
the animals with preventive vaccine, but they have not been able to
identify the cause of death. Each animal is worth Rs 10 000 to 15 000
[219.00-328.40 USD], the farmers say. The farmers have appealed to
authorities to find out the cause for the sudden death of milch animals and
also sought preventive measures.

[Though an infectious disease cannot be excluded, metabolic etiology
related to nutritional changes should also be taken into consideration.
Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
