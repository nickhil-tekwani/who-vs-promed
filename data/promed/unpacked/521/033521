[This is the low pathogenic avian influenza virus, which although it
is an H5 strain, it is not (emphasis on the not) the highly
pathogenic H5N1 which has caused human deaths. These H5 viruses are
reportable to the OIE because of the tendency for low pathogenic
strains to evolve over time into highly pathogenic ones. However, the
major global movement of H5N1 has been attributed to commercial
poultry trade or spread by wild birds, not the evolution of low
pathogenic strains in different locations.

There are 3 things that bear continued monitoring of this outbreak
though. First, the outbreaks occur in 3 different provinces,
spread widely over the country. Also, the outbreak has occurred in a
backyard population that includes fighting cocks, so it will be
particularly hard to identify infection as compared to a commercial population.

Finally, and this factor is not to be underated, is the crushing
poverty that exists in Haiti. If Paul Farmer and the Partner's in
Health initiatives have managed to bring excellent human health care
to some parts of Haiti, I suspect it has not included comprehensive
veterinary services which are almost, of necessity, government run.
Thus, we are likely to have an outbreak for which the necessary
control measures may very well require more resources than are
available. As long as the outbreak virus remains at a low
pathogenicity, then the impact will not be unusual. However, if the
virus becomes highly pathogenic, then the consequences can be more
severe in terms of bird mortality. The loss of poultry in poor
communities can be devastating economically to individual families
and initiatives like Paul Farmer's can take steps forward in terms of
health services, only to slip back into crushing poverty when
parallel efforts are not made in the animal health sector.

For those interested in Paul Farmer's thesis about deep poverty per
se being a causal factor in human ill health, I recommend his
Infections and Inequalities or for those preferring a slightly less
technical approach, read Tracy Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains.
