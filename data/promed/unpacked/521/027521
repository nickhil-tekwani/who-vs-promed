A 50-year-old Eddy County man has been confirmed with New Mexico's
1st plague case of 2008. The man was hospitalized but now is
recovering at home, the state Department of Health said Friday [25
Jan 2008]. It was the 1st case of plague ever reported in an Eddy
County resident, the department said.
The man most likely was exposed to plague while hunting and skinning
rabbits a few days before falling ill, authorities said. The
department plans an investigation in the area to look for plague in
other rabbits.
The department also reported that 8 people were potentially exposed
to pneumonic plague, a dangerous form of the disease, when a cat in
Santa Fe County developed pneumonic plague before it died. All 8
people are receiving antibiotics to prevent pneumonic plague.
Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents generally transmitted to
humans through the bites of infected fleas. It also can be
transmitted by direct contact with infected animals. Most people
become ill 2-7 days after being infected. Symptoms of bubonic plague
in humans include fever; chills; painful swollen lymph nodes in the
groin, armpit or neck; and sometimes headache, vomiting and diarrhea.
Septicemic plague, which occurs when the bacteria spread to the
blood, also can bring a high fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
Pneumonic plague involves the lungs and is the form that can spread
directly from person to person.
New Mexico reported 5 human cases of plague in 2007 with one
fatality. Eight human plague cases were reported in the state in
2006, and 3 were fatal. Four cases were confirmed in 2005.
Paul Ettestad, the Health Department's public health veterinarian,
said hunters can get plague when bacteria from an infected animal's
blood or tissues enter the bloodstream through breaks in the skin
when hunters handle or skin a carcass. The animal also might have
infected fleas, which can transmit plague through bites.
The department recommends hunters wear disposable gloves while
handling wildlife carcasses, then discard the gloves; make sure their
skin does not come into contact with blood or tissues; wash hands
thoroughly after handling wildlife; and use an aerosol insecticide to
kill fleas in the animal's fur. The agency recommends hunters
consider discarding a carcass if fleas are visible, and dispose of it
by burying or double bagging and placing in a sanitary landfill.

[Cases of plague in feral animals and therefore in humans are unusual
this early in a calendar year, although the disease may occur at
anytime. ProMED has posted a case of human plague from New Mexico in
January 2000 (Plague, bubonic, human - USA (New Mexico)
20000127.0138). However, in the past 4 years, 1st cases posted in the
USA were May 2004, May 2005, February 2006, and April 2007.
A map of the state of New Mexico showing the locations of the
counties mentioned in the posting can be found at:
