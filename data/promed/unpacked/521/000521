* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN encephalitis,

** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion.
*** Cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided.
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional
whether or not state health departments report these cases to CDC.
Click the above CDC site [URL above] for further explanations of
neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever.
Other Clinical includes persons with clinical manifestations other
than WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute
flaccid paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient
clinical information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC: These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2006 that have
been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established
by CDC to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other
mosquito-borne viruses. Information regarding 2006 virus/disease
activity is posted when such cases are reported to CDC.

[ProMED readers should note the change in URL for the USGS/CDC weekly
maps. Maps for other arthropod-borne viruses in the USA are covered
at this site also, including St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine
encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis,
and Powassan. The URL for all these maps is

[5] Mexico, Central and South America - Request for Information
Date: 27 Sep 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

[As the increase in WN virus transmission mounts in the USA and
Canada, including the southern border of the USA, ProMED requests
information on West Nile virus surveillance from Mexico and Central
and South America. It seems almost certain that WN virus transmission
is going on in the Americas south of the USA border. Any information
from this area similar to that provided in previous years would be
greatly appreciated. - Mod.TY]
