Veterinary authorities started a cull of 285 pigs in eastern Bulgaria after
an outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF), according to the ministry of
agriculture.
The disease broke out in the village of Zlatar [in the Suomen district],
where animals at 2 farms contracted the virus by drinking infected water.
[A statement from the ministry of agriculture reports that the Sofia
laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of classical swine fever, and that this
is a secondary outbreak connected with an earlier one in the region, a
month ago [February 2007].

[It will be interesting to note if and how "drinking infected water" has
been established as the source of infection. For a map with the location of
Zlatar (also known as Slatar), see
