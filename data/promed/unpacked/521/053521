Malaria and dengue in the Dominican Republic
-----------------------------------------------
In the past week [1st week of November 2004], I have seen one patient with
dengue and one patient with malaria (an older woman visiting San Francisco
de Marcolis), both having returned from the Dominican Republic. I doubt
that this is simply coincidental and suspect that conditions (such as
increased construction) are related to an upturn. Are any others seeing an
increase in cases?

[There has been a previous outbreak of malaria in the Dominican Republic.
In this previous outbreak, malaria was introduced by construction workers
from Haiti and transmitted locally. ProMED-mail would appreciate any
information on dengue fever and malaria from the Dominican Republic,
including, for instance, similar observations. - Mod.EP]
[As of 7 Nov last year, 2003, 4430 cases of dengue fever were reported --
twice as many as in 2002; reported cases of hemorrhagic dengue also rose
from 78 to 189 with 73 deaths -- see 1st dengue references below. I have
no information on dengue in the DR in 2004. - Mod.JW]
