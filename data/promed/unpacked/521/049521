Another newborn boy has contracted herpes [herpes simplex virus - Mod.LL] after a controversial Jewish circumcision ritual, the 4th case this year [2014] and the 17th since 2000, city health officials said Wednesday, 24 Dec 2014.

The baby was rushed to the hospital 12 days after undergoing the ancient ritual, known as metzitzah b'peh, which involves cleaning the circumcision wound by oral suction. The unidentified boy has recovered, but 2 of the other infected infants since 2000 died, and at least 2 suffered brain damage.

The oral suction ritual is practiced by a small number of ultra-Orthodox Jews. The CDC estimates that it is performed 3600 times a year in New York City. Some Orthodox rabbis contend there is no medical proof that babies can become sick due to the circumcisions.

In the latest case, however, the Health Department said the newborn's symptoms, the timing of the herpes outbreak, and laboratory confirmation of the herpes simplex type 1 virus "are consistent" with transmission as a result of the oral suction procedure. The new case was 1st reported by Capital New York.

In 2012, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the city enacted a regulation requiring that anyone who performs the ritual obtain a signed consent form from parents acknowledging the potential health risks. But the regulation is nearly impossible to enforce, and it is often ignored. In the latest case, it was not immediately clear whether the person who conducted the circumcision obtained a signed consent form.

As a candidate, Bill de Blasio voiced dissatisfaction with the 2012 regulation. He vowed to "change the policy and find a way to protect all the children but also respect religious tradition ... and come in Day 1 to City Hall with a new policy that is fair." Some ultra-Orthodox Jews took de Blasio's remarks as a sign that he was sympathetic to their concerns that the regulation was an unnecessary intrusion. A year has passed since he took office, but de Blasio has not yet come up with a new policy.

[In Davis DS: Ancient rites and new laws: how should we regulate religious circumcision of minors? J Med Ethics. 2013;39:456-8, the authors claim that between 2000 and 2011, 11 children have died in New York and New Jersey, following infection by herpes simplex virus, presumably from infected practitioners. However, the CDC review (CDC: Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection following Jewish ritual circumcisions that included direct orogenital suction - New York City, 2000-2011. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2012;61: 405-9) states that only 2 deaths occurred during the period, with an overall risk of the entity estimated at 1 in 4098 or 3.4 times greater than the risk among male infants considered unlikely to have had direct orogenital suction.

In Gesundheit B, Grisaru-Soen G, Greenberg D et al: Neonatal genital herpes simplex virus type 1 infection after Jewish ritual circumcision: modern medicine and religious tradition. Pediatrics. 2004;114(2):e259-63, a 2004 discussion of the issues from Israel, the following is extracted regarding the history of the subject related to infection prevention:

"According to Biblical law, a male infant should be circumcised at the age of 8 days as a sign of the eternal covenant between God and the Jewish people (Genesis 17:10-14; Leviticus 12:3). According to classical rabbinical interpretation, performance of this religious ritual offers medical advantages, a view upheld by many modern medical authorities, as noted earlier. The Babylonian Talmud, the main rabbinical literature completed in the 5th century of the common era, states that for the sake of the infant, the mohel is obliged to perform the metzitzah "so as not to bring on risk." The nature of the risk was not specified. It specifically states that "this procedure is performed for the sake of the infant's safety, and if a mohel does not perform the suction [of the wound], this is deemed dangerous, and he is to be dismissed." To prevent medical complications, the Talmud permits only an experienced and responsible mohel to perform the ritual circumcision. The Talmud was aware of potential medical problems that could arise from ritual circumcision [13] and, in fact, provided the 1st description of hemophilia in the history of medicine, manifested as a familial bleeding disorder that required circumcision to be postponed [14].

In the 19th century, Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (1818-1865) established the principles of hygiene and disease transmission [15] after neonatal tuberculosis was documented after circumcision by an infected mohel [16]. Since then, most rabbinical authorities modified their approach in response to these findings. Because the Talmudic injunction to perform metzitzah did not explicitly stipulate oral suction, more than 160 years ago, Rabbi Moses Schreiber (Pressburg, 1762-1839), a leading rabbinical authority, ruled that metzitzah could be conducted by instrumental suction [16], a ruling quickly adopted by most rabbinical authorities [17]. Consequently, the great majority of ritual circumcisions are performed today with a sterile device and not by oral suction by the mohel. However, some orthodox rabbis have felt threatened by criticism of the old religious customs and strongly resist any change in the traditional custom of oral metzitzah. The cultural process of replacing ancient customs by modern wound care has to be encouraged by a heightened awareness of this potentially life-threatening medical complication [16].

On the basis of our observations, the medico-legal impact of neonatal infection by the mohel has to be redefined. Our findings provide evidence that ritual Jewish circumcision with oral metzitzah may cause oral-genital transmission of HSV infection, resulting in clinical disease including involvement of the skin, mucous membranes, and HSV encephalitis. Furthermore, oral suction may not only endanger the child but also may expose the mohel to human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B from infected infants. The same consideration that led the Talmudic sages once to establish the custom of the metzitzah for the sake of the infant could now be applied to persuade the mohel to use instrumental suction."

3 separate studies in Africa designed to clinically assess the connection between circumcision and a lower risk of getting AIDS, each involving thousands of subjects, showed dramatic decreases in AIDS transmission in the circumcised individuals.(Ref: Layton, Julia. "Why would circumcision decrease a man's risk of contracting AIDS?" http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/life/cellular-microscopic/circum-aids.htm

But there has been no reported attempt to test the rabbi for herpes infection and, if positive, exclude him from performing the ritual in favor of uninfected priests. - Mod.JW
