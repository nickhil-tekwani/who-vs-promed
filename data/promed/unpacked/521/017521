Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a rare virus found in mosquitos that can be transmitted to horses. There haven't been any cases of EEE in almost a decade in New York state; however, that status changed on Thursday [30 Jul 2020].

In the town of Orleans, 3 horses had to be euthanized. One horse tested positive for the disease while 2 others in the same area also showed similar signs.

Jefferson County health planner Faith Lustik says it's rare but dangerous for horses and people.

"It's fatal a lot of times in a horse, and people may get it; it's not always fatal for people, but for a horse, it usually is," Lustik said.

There have been only 5 cases of EEE in people in New York since 1971, and all occurred in Oswego and Onondaga counties.

Jefferson County agricultural coordinator Jay Matteson says not all mosquitos carry the virus, but he says people should be proactive in trying to repel them.

"You could get bit by a mosquito that may be carrying that virus, so just minimize your exposure to mosquitos," Matteson said.

Most humans who are bitten by infected mosquitos fight the virus in the early stages and recover quickly. However, Lustik says we need to use precautions when necessary.

"That is why you have to use insect repellent, and you need to dump out standing water around your house, because there's where mosquitos breed," she said. "So that will just make you even more comfortable and reduce the risk of disease."

Horse owners should speak to their veterinarians about vaccination against EEE.

Here's more information about the disease from Public Health:

- 5 cases of EEE in people in New York state have been reported since 1971. These cases were reported in 1971, 1983, 2009, 2010, and 2011 and occurred in Oswego and Onondaga counties. All 5 cases died.
- The risk of getting EEE is highest from late July through September.
- People at the greatest risk of developing severe disease are those over 50 years of age and younger than 15 years of age.
- There is no specific treatment available for EEE.
- Mosquitoes are most active between dusk and dawn. Protection measures include wearing shoes and socks, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when outside for a long period.
- Applying a mosquito repellent containing DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 is also recommended to prevent mosquito bites.
- Do not put the repellent directly on children. Put it on your hands and apply it to your child.
- Do not put insect repellent on your face. Wash skin and clothing after returning indoors. Repair screens in your home. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for application.
- Keep your yard free from standing water to reduce the mosquito population near your home.
- Throw away outdoor containers, ceramic pots, or containers that hold water.
- Remove all tires from your property.
- Drill holes in the bottoms of recycling containers that are kept outdoors.
- Clean clogged rain gutters and make sure they continue to work properly.
- Turn over wheelbarrows and wading pools when not in use.
- Change water in bird baths at least every 4 days.
- Clear vegetation and debris from the edges of ponds.
- Clean chlorinated swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs.
- Drain water from pool covers.
- Use landscaping to eliminate low spots where standing water accumulates.

The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets reported 3 confirmed cases of EEE. Two of the cases were in LaFargeville, New York, and one was in Evans Mill, New York.

The 1st horse in LaFargeville was an 11-year-old grade mare having onset of clinical signs on 25 Jul 2020 including depression, recumbent, and no anal-tail tone. The mare was euthanized.

The 2nd horse in LaFargeville was a 2-year-old grade colt having onset of clinical signs on 25 Jul 2020 including ataxia, recumbent, seizures, and photophobia. The unvaccinated colt was euthanized.

Both horses were euthanized on 26 Jul 2020 due to poor quality of life. Brain samples for both animals were sent to the Wadsworth Lab. Rabies and West Nile virus [WNV] were negative. EEE was detected in both the mare and colt. There was no recent travel history off of the farm. The attending veterinarian noted that the similar presentation of clinical signs occurred the summer prior to this episode, but the owner declined testing.

The case in Evans Mill, New York, was in a 6-year-old Standardbred mare. She had onset of clinical signs on 26 Jul 2020 including appetite loss, falling, head pressing, and leaning. The unvaccinated mare was euthanized.

The mare was euthanized on 28 Jul 2020 due to poor quality of life. Brain and blood samples were sent to both Cornell and Wadsworth Lab. Brain samples are pending for arboviruses. Rabies is negative. IgM for EEE is positive. Serology for WNV is negative. There was no recent travel off of the farm.

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services has confirmed a 3rd horse in Suffolk County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

A 2-year-old Thoroughbred Filly was euthanized after showing severe neurological signs. The horse had an incomplete vaccination history, and lab results confirm EEE.

No other horses on the farm are showing signs of EEE.

VDACS encourages horse owners to speak with their veterinarians about vaccinating their horses for West Nile Virus (WNV) and EEE. Vaccinations are effective for 6-12 months.

The mortality rate for WNV is 30% and up to 90% for EEE.

[Vaccination is very effective in preventing eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The vaccine is a combination vaccine, which usually includes EEE, western equine encephalitis (WEE), West Nile virus (WNV), and tetanus. Some vaccines do not contain the WEE, unless you are in a more western state, generally west of the Mississippi River. The single injection is given intramuscularly (in the muscle) and then repeated in about 3 weeks.

The immunity to EEE wanes in about 3-4 months, so in areas where there is a high rate of EEE, it is advisable to booster the EEE. Some states may suggest you repeat the booster 3-4 months after the 1st booster, depending upon the mosquito burden in the area and the weather. Generally, the disease dies out when the mosquitoes die out during cold weather. For those suffering with the mosquitoes and this disease, a frost is likely welcomed. - Mod.TG
