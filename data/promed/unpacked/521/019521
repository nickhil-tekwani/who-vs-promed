At least 7 babies in the mountainous province of Cao Bang died the past 5 weeks possibly due to viral encephalitis, raising concerns about an outbreak.

The province's health department said 7 babies less than 6 months died in 1 district between 19 Apr and 25 May [2016], and 12 others are under treatment with similar symptoms that include fever, cough, and respiratory inflammation.

Experts from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology who visited the children suspected that they suffer from viral encephalitis. It is a rare but acute condition that causes inflammation of the brain and usually starts with flu-like symptoms.

The fatalities are very high compared to only 3 encephalitis deaths reported from all other places in the country this year [2016]. The exact virus and strain in these 7 cases have not been identified.

Tran Dac Phu, head of the Preventive Health Department at the health ministry, said the disease peaks between June and August. It is a dangerous one because late treatment can leave severe damage to the nervous system. People can be infected through insects' bites, ingestion, or inhaling. Children under 15 are more vulnerable.

Viet Nam provides vaccination against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) for children from 1 year old.

But protection against other encephalitis virus groups such as herpes and enterovirus is not available yet. The latter causes the hand-foot-mouth disease that claims many children lives in Viet Nam every year.

Medical experts from the Ministry of Health have found coxsackievirus through testing residents in the northern province of Cao Bang's [province] Quang Lam Commune in Bao Lam District.

From the test result, the Department of Preventive Medicine under the Ministry yesterday [28 May 2016] arrived at the conclusion saying [coxsackievirus A] is the cause of the encephalitis outbreak which infected many kids. Deaths from encephalitis were also reported.

Head of the Department of Preventive Medicine Dr Tran Dac Phu said that the commune had 21 infected kids and 7 of them died of the disease.

The 1st patient had the symptoms of the disease on [20 Apr 2016] and died in the next day at the province's General Hospital in the northern province of Ha Giang.

All dead kids are under 6 months old and experienced slight fever, cried, stopped breastfeeding, digestive problem, some had cough, breathing problem, and then convulsion fits, slept soundly, and died. Patients died because the disease developed so fast and they were taken to medical facilities too late.

At present, 8 kids are being treated and one in serious condition. As of 27 May 2016, no new case was reported.

The National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology took 11 samples for test. Test results showed that no kids are positive for influenza virus, yet 2 of samples are positive for coxsackie A6 virus -- digestive virus -- which causes dangerous diseases including encephalitis, myocarditis, hand-foot-and mouth, conjunctivitis.

Kids are usually infected with the virus year round yet there is an increase of the disease in summer and most cases are in the north. Worse, there is no vaccine against the disease while the infection is transmitted through human-to-human direct contact with nasal and oral secretions or faecal contamination of the infected.

Accordingly, to avoid infection with the virus, the Department of Preventive Medicine warned to separate ill kids to prevent transmission, increase personal hygiene, and wash hands with soap regularly. People must eat boiled food and water, pay attention to food safety and hygiene.

Adults and kids must be hospitalized if they experience fever and digestive problem.

More than 90 percent of coxsackievirus infections are asymptomatic or cause nonspecific febrile illnesses. In neonates, they are the most common cause of febrile illnesses during the summer and fall months. 13 percent of newborns with fever in the 1st month of life were noted to have an enteroviral infection. In addition to nonspecific illnesses, various well-described illnesses have been associated with coxsackievirus infections [including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and neurologic disease] (from Medscape http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/215241-clinical), [however CVA6 is not listed among the most common coxsackie A viruses that lead to these complications.]

The incidence of CNS complications in enterovirus infection has been reported to range from 2-10 percent. Even so, according to a prospective study of 773 children and retrospective study of 423 patients, it can go as high as to 19-42 percent, respectively. Of the 773 children, EV71 was isolated in 277 (41 per cent) and out of the 277 children, a further 28 had coinfections with a second virus (other enteroviruses, adenovirus and unidentified virus). Coxsackievirus A was isolated in 85 patients and out of these, 4 had coinfections as well. Other enteroviruses, adenoviruses, or unidentified viruses were isolated in 58. While coinfections with other enteroviruses did not appear to increase the risk of neurological complications, an association was found between patients who were coinfected with dengue viruses and neurological symptoms. Similarly, in the retrospective study of 423 patients, those with CNS involvement were more likely to have EV71 (21 percent) instead of coxsackievirus A infection (16 percent). In addition, rate of disease progression and severity was reported to be greater in EV71 infection.
