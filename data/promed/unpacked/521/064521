A total of 150 persons infected with cutaneous leishmaniasis have been identified since the beginning of the year [2017] in the governorate of Tataouine, according to the regional director of public health of the region, Brahim Gharghar.

The delegations most concerned are those of Dhehiba, Remada and Ghomrassen, he added.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic and non-contagious disease. It is transmitted from rodents to humans by the bite of insects and usually causes wounds and other pimples that are not contagious but can leave scars on the skin.

According to the statistics of the Ministry of Health, about 3000 cases are reported annually in Tunisia especially in rural areas of central and southern parts of the country and mainly among children.

[Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, CL, caused by L.major is a major public health problem in Tunisia. It occurs mainly in central and southwestern Tunisia (semi-arid and arid areas) with thousands of cases. There are foci with a permanent active transmission, so, from time to time, outbreaks occur, related to new agricultural projects or large population movements (introduction to a non-immune population). In some villages, up to 60 percent of the population is infected. For a detailed discussion of Leishmania in Tunisia please see Alvar J et al. (Alvar J, VÃ©lez ID, Bern C, Herrero M, Desjeux P, Cano J, et al. (2012) Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence.
