In the Ternopil zoo, a pony died of anthrax on the night of [Mon 27 Sep 2021] on the territory of the aviary. Today the anthrax infection was confirmed by Kyiv veterinarians. Employees who came in the morning to feed the zoo animals, finding a dead pony, immediately reported the case to the Ternopil City Veterinary Hospital.

"Specialists from the hospital and the Ternopil Regional State Laboratory of the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection went to the scene. During the [necropsy] of the animal, signs of pneumonia, gastroenteritis and lymphadenitis were found, and the enlargement and rounding of the edges of the spleen aroused suspicion of anthrax," the State Food and Consumer Service of Ternopil region reported.

To confirm anthrax infection, specialists took samples of the spleen, liver, heart and lymph nodes. This material was sent to the regional state laboratory of the State Food and Consumer Services. After the necropsy, "The [carcass] of a pony was removed by incineration, about which a relevant act was drawn up and a photograph was taken. The burnt remains were buried, and the burial place and the transport by which the corpse was transported were disinfected," the Ternopil State Food and Consumer Service reported.

A pony died in the Ternopil zoo "Topilche" on the night of [Mon 27 Sep 2021]. This was urgently reported to the Ternopil City Veterinary Hospital. Specialists took all necessary measures to identify the cause of death.

According to the press service of the State Consumer Service, specialists from the hospital and the Ternopil Regional State Laboratory of the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection went to the scene. The [necropsy] revealed signs of pneumonia, gastroenteritis and lymphadenitis, and enlargement and rounding of the edges of the spleen aroused suspicion of anthrax.

Specialists took samples of the spleen, liver, heart and lymph nodes and sent them to the Ternopil Regional State Laboratory of the State Food and Consumer Service for testing for anthrax. The corpse of the animal was taken to a specially designated place and subjected to removal by incineration, about which a relevant act was drawn up and a photograph was taken. The burnt remains were buried, and the burial place and the transport by which the corpse was transported were disinfected.

According to the report on the results of the study of pathological (biological) material of the Ternopil Regional State Laboratory of the State Service of Ukraine for Food Safety and Consumer Protection, anthrax was diagnosed. Pathological material for confirmation of the diagnosis was transferred to the State Research Institute for Laboratory Diagnostics and Veterinary Sanitary Examination (Kyiv), which on [Mon 4 Oct 2021] confirmed the diagnosis.

On [Sat 2 Oct 2021], a meeting of the State Emergency Anti-Epizootic Commission under the Executive Committee of the Ternopil City Council was held, which imposed a quarantine on the zoo and approved an action plan. Animals kept in the zoo are subjected to clinical examination and thermometry and vaccinated against anthrax.

As of today, animal health is being monitored. Veterinary specialists take measures in accordance with the plan. Human contacts are under medical supervision.

[Ternopil is a city in western Ukraine. Administratively, Ternopil serves as the administrative centre of Ternopil Oblast and has the status of city of oblast significance. Located on the banks of the Seret. Until 1944, it was known mostly as Tarnopol. Ternopil is one of the major cities of Western Ukraine and the historical regions of Galicia and Podolia; for a map see, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternopil.

Traditionally zoo animals become infected as a result of feeding with a purchased but contaminated feed; in this case it would have been hay, though a contaminated bone mineral mix is not impossible. In either case one would not expect this to be the only affected animal seen in the zoo. If hay, it probably came from Odessa, an oblast with cases in 2020 & 2018 (see postings listed below). Anthrax is just sporadic in Ukraine and thus why the zoo veterinarian did a necropsy, not something that is normally advised with cases of anthrax. In such circumstances it is very easy to get infected.

[There is no reference to the outbreak reported here for 28 Oct 2018 but it might have been a late case following on from the previous
outbreaks in that month. They have ignored the 2020 incident when the human may have been exposed to a dead bovine. They list all the other animals in this zoo so theoretically there could have been ample opportunity for other animals to have been exposed by the source, not just the other 7 horses. A puzzle. - Mod.MHJ
