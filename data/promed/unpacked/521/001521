An outbreak of a virulent bird flu virus has spread to another farm in northeastern Bulgaria, the national food safety agency said on [Wed 13 Jun 2018].

A 3-kilometer [2-mi] protection zone was set around the farm in the village of Donchevo [Dobrich] and the sale of eggs and the movement of domestic, wild, and other birds was banned within it, the agency said in a statement.

"All contaminated and contact birds in 2 of the farm halls will be culled in a humane manner," it said.

2 weeks ago the agency authorities reported an outbreak of the virus on a duck farm in the village of Stefanovo [Dobrich] and said birds on the farm were being culled.

Bulgaria has reported a handful of outbreaks in the past year, some involving the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu virus.

[For the location of Donchevo, in the northeastern region of Dobrich, see map at https://tinyurl.com/y85umub9. The recent outbreak in adjacent Stefanovo was reportedly caused by HPAI H5N8, which, most likely, is the causative agent behind the current outbreak as well.

The outbreak in Stefanovo started on 25 May 2018. According to a follow-up (no 2) report submitted to OIE by Bulgaria on 10 Jun 2018, out of the 21 071 birds on the affected premises in Stefanovo, 5365 died and the remaining 15 706 were killed and disposed of. The details of this outbreak and of 4 additional, distant, earlier HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in Bulgaria (center-south, starting between 10 and 24 Apr 2018), all caused by HPAI H5N8, are available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=26837.

The current event in Bulgaria started on 2 Mar 2018. Its OIE summary (as of 10 Jun 2018) is the following:
Total outbreaks: 7 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 58 741 / 11 615 / 11 615 / 47126 / 0

Follow-up report No 2 has been termed "final". However, the new outbreak in Donchevo means that the event is not yet over. - Mod.AS
