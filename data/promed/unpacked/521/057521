9 people have been arrested for selling fake bird flu vaccines that
are suspected to have contributed to an outbreak of the disease in
northeastern China's Liaoning province.
Police have arrested officials of the Jinyu Group, a company based in
Inner Mongolia that produces medicines, and of the Inner Mongolian
Biological Medical Products Factory, the Liaoxi Commercial Daily
reported Wednesday [30 Nov 2005].
After a 20-day investigation covering 4 provinces and regions, police
found the 2 companies had manufactured and sold 200 000 vials of 12
different kinds of bird flu vaccine nationwide, the report said.
With 29 outbreaks of the disease discovered so far this year, China
is seeking to vaccinate its estimated 5.2 billion farm-raised birds,
but requires manufacturers to have a license to produce the vaccines.
Police said that the Jinyu Corporation failed to apply for a license
from the state to manufacture bird flu vaccines for poultry, but
labelled its products with fake government licensing numbers, it said.
Investigators found the fake vaccines were used on farms in
Liaoning's Jinzhou region, where an outbreak of bird flu occurred in
mid-October 2005, the report said.
Some 2.5 million farm raised birds were culled in the Jinzhou region
following the outbreak, devastating the livelihood of farmers in the region.
The relationship between the 2 suspected companies was not
immediately clear, but one man arrested, Wang Jiafu, was a vice
director of the Jinyu Corporation as well as the legal representative
of the Inner Mongolian Biological Medical Products Factory, [the report] said.
The government warned this month that the use of fake vaccines in
Liaoning could have disastrous consequences for China. "The use of
fake and shoddy vaccines will result in a disaster," Agriculture
Minister Du Qingling said on 9 Nov 2005. "If the vaccines are not up
to standard, then immunization to the virus will not be uniform or
effective. This could bring huge losses."
Farms in Liaoning were highly concentrated, Du said, meaning that any
problems in vaccinating poultry could result in the epidemic spreading.
"If we miss the chance to exterminate the virus in the early stages,
then the difficulty in wiping it out will increase by several times,
as will the spread of the epidemic," Du said. "We must fully
recognize that at present there is a possibility that the epidemic
will spread and expand. This is not an exaggeration just to scare people."

[Hopefully, the current efforts to tackle illegal vaccines for
poultry (and other animals?!) in China will be more effective than in
the past. The practice, apparently related to the higher prices (and
more laborious application mode?) of licensed vaccines, has been
ongoing for an extended period. It seems to be widespread, involving
numerous unlicensed manufacturers in various provinces; see "Crack
down on fake poultry vaccines; all provinces instructed to deal with
the problem" in posting 20040211.0462, 11 Feb 2004.
In a previous posting, we presented the names of the 9 laboratories
licensed in China to produce avian influenza vaccines. The control
upon vaccine production in China was one of the issues addressed
during a visit by OIE experts to China in May 2004. Their report
included the following information:
"Evaluation of the avian influenza vaccine (inactivated)
manufacturing and controls
---------------------------------------------------
Institute of Veterinary Drug Control: Initially outlines of
production were presented, as well as general data concerning the
method of preparation of the finished products (H5N2 and H9).
Subsequently a more complete presentation was made that discussed the
quality controls for in-process products and finished products. The
subsequent presentation summarised the measures taken to ensure the
quality of inactivated AI vaccines produced in China, i.e. product
license system, audit system by IVDC inspectors in manufacturing
plants, and tests on each batch produced. The IVDC approval for batch
release is granted when satisfactory test results by the manufacturer
are received. In this case, the Manufacturer's Release Certificate is
countersigned and stamped by the IVDC and returned to the sender
accompanied by a number of "Approbation labels" equivalent to the
number of vaccine bottles filled with the batch volume. Satisfactory
batches are identified by additional government labels stuck on the
vaccine bottle cap, with the aim to prevent sales of fake vaccines." - Mod.AS]

The following summary has been extracted, by a reliable Chinese
contact, from a TV interview covering the activities of the
Veterinary Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences, Harbin (HVRI):
"The inactivated H5N1 vaccine used in China was produced from a
recombinant strain of LPAI (H5N1) constructed by reverse-genetic
techniques. The HA and NA were taken from a local prevalent dominant
strain of H5N1(the sites related to the high pathogenicity in HA was
blocked/deleted), and the other 6 genes were taken from the PR8
strain (previously isolated from humans). This recombinant can grow
well in Vero cells and chicken embryo. The use of this recombinant as
a vaccine candidate has been subject to extensive debates among
Chinese scientists; a lot of concern was [expressed regarding] the
potential for a 'gene switch' for the vaccine strain and field HPAI
viruses and regarding bio-safety procedures."
Our Chinese contact adds: detailed information on the vaccine would
have allowed a serious look at relevant potential risks. However, the
vaccine has been widely used nationwide and the outcome is not known.
In the meantime, another new vaccine, bivalent Avian
influenza/Newcastle disease vaccine, has been developed and quickly
put into production before thorough bio-safety studies. Hopefully,
the political pressures for an immediate solution -- namely releasing
prematurely the experimental vaccines for extensive field application
-- won't [hinder] the scientists' pursuit for truth and perfection.

China has developed a new and better vaccine for use on birds against
the avian influenza strain that scientists fear could cause a global
pandemic among humans, media reports said on Saturday.
The vaccine has the advantage of fighting another common bird
disease, as well as the H5N1 influenza strain that has spread from
Asia to Europe, state television reported. It identified this as
avulavirus APMV-1, also known as Newcastle disease.
"What's more, the new vaccine is safer, more convenient to use and
cannot kill newborn chicks," it said, listing attributes that made it
more attractive to farmers than a vaccine they were already using.
For example, the new vaccine could be applied by spraying.
"In addition, the cost of the new vaccine in mass production is only
1/5 that of the previous vaccine."
The country was preparing to put the vaccine into mass production,
Xinhua new agency reported. The H5N1 bird flu strain emerged in Hong
Kong in 1997, resurfaced in 2003 in South Korea, and has since spread
to other Asian countries and Europe.

[The Chinese bivalent vaccine might be related to a previously
published paper on experimental recombinant NCD/AI vaccine, namely -
Swayne DE, Suarez DL, Schultz-Cherry S, Tumpey TM, King DJ, Nakaya T,
Palese P, Garcia-Sastre A. (2003). Recombinant paramyxovirus type
1-avian influenza-H7 virus as a vaccine for protection of chickens
against influenza and Newcastle. Avian Dis. 47(3 Suppl):1047-50.
For convenience, see the following abstract of the said paper:
"Current vaccines to prevent avian influenza rely upon
labor-intensive parenteral injection. A more advantageous vaccine
would be capable of administration by mass immunization methods such
as spray or water vaccination. A recombinant vaccine (rNDV-AIV-H7)
was constructed by using a lentogenic paramyxovirus type 1 vector
(Newcastle disease virus [NDV] B1 strain) with insertion of the
hemagglutinin (HA) gene from avian influenza virus (AIV)
A/chicken/NY/13142-5/94 (H7N2). The recombinant virus had stable
insertion and expression of the H7 AIV HA gene as evident by
detection of HA expression via immunofluorescence in infected Vero
cells. The rNDV-AIV-H7 replicated in 9-10 day embryonating chicken
eggs and exhibited hemagglutinating activity from both NDV and AI
proteins that was inhibited by antisera against both NDV and AIV H7.
Groups of 2-week-old white Leghorn chickens were vaccinated with
transfectant NDV vector (tNDV), rNDV-AIV-H7, or sterile allantoic
fluid and were challenged 2 weeks later with viscerotropic velogenic
NDV (vvNDV) or highly pathogenic (HP) AIV. The sham-vaccinated birds
were not protected from vvNDV or HP AIV challenge. The transfectant
NDV vaccine provided 70 percent protection for NDV challenge but did
not protect against AIV challenge. The rNDV-AIV-H7 vaccine provided
partial protection (40 percent) from vvNDV and HP AIV challenge. The
serologic response was examined in chickens that received 1 or 2
immunizations of the rNDV-AIV-H7 vaccine. Based on hemagglutination
inhibition and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests,
chickens that received a vaccine boost seroconverted to AIV H7, but
the serologic response was weak in birds that received only one
vaccination. This demonstrates the potential for NDV for use as a
vaccine vector in expressing AIV proteins".
Most likely, the Chinese scientists applied a similar approach,
inserting an H5 gene (from which virus strain?) instead of H7.
It would be helpful to obtain data on their work, particularly the
methods and results of challenge trials, hopefully with better
results than the ones obtained by the experimental rNDV-AIV-H7
vaccine. - Mod.AS]
