Dr. Meyer from Singapore is bringing up a point that has troubled us for
some years. We have avoided writing about it as we are still actively
engaging in studies in an effort to clarify this issue for us who are
working in a rabies endemic country.
What does one do with a subject who had pre-exposure vaccination and is now
exposed to rabies? How reliable are the two WHO approved boosters if there
is a severe exposure and some time has gone by since the pre-exposure
vaccination? What do we do with our veterinary students or tourists) who
need reliable pre-exposure protection?
One must consider several factors regarding these issues:
1) How reliable was the pre-exposure vaccination history and vaccine used?
2) Was the vaccine given as a full dose (> 2.5 IU) IM X 3 or was it an
intradermal schedule with reduced antigen load?
3) What is the longevity of immunity and will there be a truly accelerated
immune response (anamnestic response) that makes the use of RIG not
necessary?
We know from immunogenicity studies (look at "Medline") that modern tissue
culture vaccines (HDCV, PVRV, PDEV and PCEC) are all more potent than the
recommended 2.5 IU/mL minimum. Batches of PCEC, PVRV and PDEV sold in Asia
have recently all been above 5 IU/mL.
Reliability of the previous vaccination history has to be evaluated for
each case and may not be simple at times. If in doubt treatment as if no
vaccine had been given is the safest route and will do no harm. The mild
serum sickness like reactions overemphasized by US authors are rarely seen
in busy animal bite clinics like ours where we use mostly PVRV, PCEC and
PDEV and not HDCV.
Several studies have shown that IM pre-exposure vaccination with tissue
culture vaccines induces long lasting immunity (up to 16 years so far). See
O.Threanhart et al Clin Immunol Immunopath 1994; 71: 287-292, D. Biggs et
al Vaccine 1992; 10: 125-129. We have recently shown in two (still ongoing)
studies, now submitted to peer review journals, that IM pre-exposure
vaccination confers excellent residual immunity and a vigorous anamnestic
response in vet students when given a simulated post-exposure booster (day
0 and 3). This accelerated response reaches protective titers (>0.5) by day
5 after the first booster! No need for RIG in such cases.
Unfortunately, this is not true for persons given intradermal (ID)
pre-exposure series. They do not all show an anamnestic response by day 5
and 7 but have high titers by day 14. They may thus not be protected
against a severe exposure by day 5-7 when the virus may enter nerve endings
and be in a protected environment.
Previous post-exposure vaccination with either intradermal or intramuscular
tissue culture vaccines all produce long lasting immunity and a vigorous
anamnestic response to 2 boosters as recommended by WHO. This was confirmed
by several studies. Jaijaroensup W et al Clin Diagn Virol 1998 in print.
Narapong N. J Travel Med 1998 in print. Other studies can be found in
"Medline". Previous recipients of nerve tissue derived vaccines do not have
a reliable anamnestic response and should be treated "de novo" Khawplod P
et al Vaccine 1996; 14: 1549-1552.
This institution, affiliated with Chulalongkorn University and the Thai red
Cross, operates the principal animal bite clinic in Bangkok. Some 30-40 new
patients are seen daily. We have also seen 2 human rabies cases this year
alone and used to see many more. How do we manage the problems concerning
Dr. Meyer here? Firstly, we have no final answer and are very much aware
of the fact that we over-treat patients. We have little choice in this as
50% of dogs examined at our lab are still FAT positive.
1) A patient with reliable IM pre-exposure history less than 5 years ago
presents with a new exposure. We give him 2 boosters IM or ID on days 0 and
3 after cleaning the wound well. If it is more than 5 years or history not
reliable, we treat as if no prior vaccine was given. This may be revised
with time.
2) The same situation but patient had ID pre-exposure. We treat as if there
was no previous vaccination. Category III (WHO 1992) subjects have the
wounds injected with RIG as well.
3) A patient presents with a documented full intradermal or intramuscular
post-exposure series at any length of time with a tissue culture vaccine.
He or she gets 2 boosters IM or ID on days 0 and 3.
We cannot afford giving our veterinary students IM pre-exposure vaccination
at this time even though PVRV, PCEC and PDEV are less than 1 US$ per dose.
They get ID pre-exposure and get a booster every year. We follow a subgroup
with titers and may change this routine with time as we learn more. Issue
we must know is: "When and for how long do these people have a anamnestic
response not only do they have a titer above 0.5 IU/ml by day 14!" [sic
When tourists or rich expatriates living in Thailand ask us about
pre-exposure vaccination, we urge them to spend the money and get it IM.
They then only need boosters if they get exposed.
We consider the following vaccines interchangable and suggest that one uses
the least expensive one. PCEC, PVRV, PDEV. HDCV is a luxury in poor
countries and has little if any advantages to offer. We think that serum
sickness-like reactions are more common with HDCV (it has lots of albumin
as stabilizer which acts as a hapten).
This is a bit long but perhaps we answer some of Dr. Meyer's questions.
