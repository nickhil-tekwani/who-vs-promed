Cambodian girl dies of H5N1
---------------------------
Cambodia's Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization
announced Friday [10 Jun 2011] that a 7-year-old girl from the eastern
province of Prey Veng has died of avian influenza H5N1, reports Xinhua
news agency. The girl died on 7 Jun 2011 as a result of respiratory
complications after contracting avian influenza virus H5N1, said a
joint statement sent to the media.

"The girl is the 16th person in Cambodia to become infected with the
H5N1 virus and the 14th person to die from complications of the
disease since 2005," it said. The patient became sick on 24 May 2011
and she was initially treated by private practitioners; however, her
condition continued to worsen and she was later brought to Kantha
Bopha Children Hospital in Phnom Penh for treatment on 31 May 2011,
where she died on 7 Jun 2011.

"Avian influenza is still a threat to the health of Cambodians.
Compared to last year, we have seen more H5N1 cases this year and
children appear to be most vulnerable," the Minister of Health Mam
Bunheng said in the statement.

"I would like to urge parents and guardians to keep children away
from sick or dead poultry and if they develop signs of respiratory
infections, they should be brought to medical attention at the nearest
health facilities as soon as possible," he added.
