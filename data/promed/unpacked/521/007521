There's an outbreak of an unidentified parvo-like illness killing young dogs in northern Michigan, officials said. During the past month, many dogs have gotten sick with what appears to be parvo, but tests have come back negative, according to information from Otsego County Animal Shelter.

Signs include vomiting and bloody stool. Most of the dogs have been under 2 years old and have died within 3 days of showing signs. Some of the dogs were vaccinated.

The shelter is in contact with veterinarians in Gaylord, Traverse City, Grayling, Mancelona, and Indian River who have dealt with the illness and are trying to riddle it out. The state veterinarian, the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Michigan State University (MSU) Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory are also involved. A necropsy was done at MSU on one of the dogs.

"No one has an answer," said Melissa FitzGerald, director of Otsego County animal shelter and control. "The best 'guess' is this is a strain of parvo."

The illness has been reported in Otsego County in Vanderbilt, Gaylord and west and south of Gaylord, officials said. "We really don't know anything," FitzGerald said. "The only thing is to make sure your pets are vaccinated and at the 1st sign of illness, get to the veterinarian."

Cherryland Humane Society in Grand Traverse County announced Tuesday [9 Aug 2022] they will be open to the public by appointment only this week "due to illness." However, staff told MLive the illness is not parvo, or a parvo-like illness, and is completely unrelated to the situation in Otsego County.

[It is possible this is a new variant of parvovirus. The article indicated the dogs were vaccinated. However, my question would be when were they vaccinated? Was it in a timely fashion or were they overdue for a booster? There have been reports of some strains of vaccine being ineffective. One other thing to explore is how were the vaccines handled. Had they been left out of refrigeration for too long or shipped without appropriate amounts of ice?

Another possibility is maternal antibodies that may have interfered with the vaccine, necessitating additional vaccines, perhaps 5 instead of the standard 3, to provide protection of these animals.

Alternatively, it is horrible to think we are dealing with a new strain of parvovirus for which there may not yet be a vaccine. If anyone has further information on this parvo-like outbreak, we would appreciate more information. - Mod.TG
