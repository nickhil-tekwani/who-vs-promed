Xin L, Bai T, Zhou JF, et al. Seropositivity for avian influenza H6 virus among humans, China [letter]. 2015. _Emerg Infect Dis_ 21(7) Jul [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2107.150135. Letter. Ahead of print
----------------------------------------
Although only one case of H6 virus infection in a human has been reported worldwide (6), several biological characteristics of H6 viruses indicate that they are highly infectious to mammals. Approximately 34 percent of H6 viruses circulating in China have enhanced affinity to human-like receptors (alpha-2,6 NeuAcGal) (2). H6 viruses can also infect mice without prior adaptation (2,7), and some H6 viruses can be transmitted efficiently among guinea pigs (2). To evaluate the potential threat of H6 viruses to human health, we conducted a systematic serologic study in populations occupationally exposed to H6 viruses.

Human infection with influenza H6 virus in Mainland China has not been reported, but 63 serum specimens tested in our study were positive for the H6 virus. This level of seropositivity is much higher than that for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, for which only 2 of the serum specimens we tested were positive (data not shown), but much lower than the seropositivity level for low pathogenicity avian influenza A(H9N2) virus; 3.4 percent of the samples tested were positive for A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/1997(H9N2)-like virus (data not shown). A previous US study has reported H6N2-positive antibodies in veterinarians (9). Our results and the veterinarian study indicate that the H6N2 virus could infect humans.

In our study, positive samples were detected in 19 of 22 provinces and in all tested worker populations, suggesting that the H6 virus has been broadly circulating in birds in China. Live poultry market exposure is the major risk factor for human infection with avian influenza H6 virus. The limitation of this study is that antigen selection may not accurately detect neutralization antibodies for different subtypes of H6 viruses. Surveillance of the H6 virus in birds and occupationally exposed populations should be strengthened for pandemic preparedness.

[H6, 1st isolated from a turkey in Massachusetts, USA in 1965, represents another subtype of avian influenza virus (in addition to H5, H7, and H9) that poses a worldwide public health threat. This subtype has been isolated from wild and domestic aquatic and terrestrial birds, frequently in poultry markets. In a study that evaluated the transmissibility of H6 viruses to mammals, Wang et al. (ref 2 above) demonstrated that 3 percent of the viruses are able to bind human type receptors and that some of them are able to transmit efficiently to contact animals. This new report demonstrating evidence of antibody to H6 in poultry workers, confirms the ability of H6 viruses to infect humans. It would be wise to maintain vigilance in following the evolution of H6 viruses for changes in virulence and transmissibility. This subtype already has shown ability to be pathogenic occasionally in chickens, mice, and humans - Mod.LK]

[Only influenza A viruses are known to infect birds. They include 16 haemagglutinin (H) and 9 neuraminidase (N) subtypes. The term "highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)" refers to infection with highly pathogenic strains of influenza A virus. The OIE has defined specific criteria to assess the pathogenicity of influenza A virus isolates for domestic poultry. Although all naturally occurring HPAI strains isolated to date have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype, most H5 or H7 isolates have been of low pathogenicity.

For the purposes of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, avian influenza is notifiable to OIE and is defined as "an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus with high pathogenicity (HPAI) and by H5 and H7 subtypes with low pathogenicity (H5/H7 LPAI)." The other 14 H subtypes (H1-4, H6 and H8-16), if of low pathogenicity in poultry, are not defined as avian influenza and are not notifiable. The current H6 infections are of low pathogenicity in poultry thus not notifiable (and not liable to control requirements).

In case a natural transmission of an animal infection to humans has been proven, AND the human infection is associated with severe consequences, the said infection may be added to OIE's list of notifiable diseases; this, provided specified additional requirements are fulfilled, as detailed in article 1.2.2 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahc/2010/chapitre_criteria_diseases.pdf. - Mod.AS]
