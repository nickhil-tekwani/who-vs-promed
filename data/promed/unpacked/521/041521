Ban lifted on movement of livestock in regions affected by RVF
-----------------------------------------------
Saudi authorities have lifted a 3 year old ban on the movement of livestock
between regions hit by Rift Valley Fever (RVF). Agriculture Minister Dr
Fahd Balghaneim, who announced the decision, urged precautionary measures
to prevent further outbreaks of the disease. The ban was imposed on animals
in Jizan, the Tihama areas of Asir, Makkah, as well as Baha regions
Qunfudha, Najran, and Tihama Qahtan. The RVF outbreak in Jizan killed more
than 125 people 3 years ago.
The authorities agreed to lift the ban in light of a ministerial committee
report, the Saudi Press Agency quoted Dr Balghaneim as saying. The
committee, chaired by interior minister Prince Naif, included the ministers
of municipal and rural affairs, health, and agriculture. The report said
the campaign to contain the disease had been successful. The situation is
now stable, as no RVF viral activity has been found in humans, animals, or
mosquitoes, he said. The committee also took into account the
recommendations of international organizations related to contagious and
animal diseases as well as those of a panel studying the ban's economic effect.
Dr Balghaneim urged the authorities to be cautious about the RVF virus,
which is capable of surviving in the eggs of mosquitoes for a long time and
can surface whenever its finds a hospitable environment. The minister
advised cattle owners intending to transport their animals from
RVF-affected areas to other parts of the Kingdom to contact the ministry in
advance.
The Agriculture Ministry has set up an early-warning unit to monitor and
contain infectious diseases that affect agricultural and animal resources
in certain regions, before those diseases spread to other parts of the
Kingdom. The ministry also established a laboratory in Jizan to carry out
medical tests and check the effectiveness of insecticides. The situation is
safer now, as tests of mosquitoes found that they no longer carry the virus
that causes the disease, the minister said.
RVF primarily affects animals but occasionally causes illness in humans, in
whom it leads to high morbidity and mortality. According to the World
Health Organization, many different species of mosquitoes are vectors for
the RVF virus.

[The minister's advice to cattle owners intending to transport their
animals from RVF-affected areas to other parts of the Kingdom to "contact
the ministry in advance" may indicate that some residual RVF infection in
these areas has not been excluded. Data on the surveillance and monitoring
measures in place could be helpful. - Mod.AS]
