Epidemiological comments A pig farm used for pedagogical purposes
owned by the School of Agriculture in the State of Guerrero. The farm
was quarantined, the pigs were culled and sentinel animals were
introduced. Simultaneously, as a result of the epidemiological
investigation, another outbreak linked to the 1st outbreak detected
was identified; the same control measures were applied: quarantine,
culling, disinfection and introduction of sentinel animals. All farms
were used for production for local or own consumption. Vaccination is
still prohibited throughout the country since 4 Oct 2006 and an active
epidemiological surveillance is applied in all pig holdings in the
country both technified and backyard holdings.

Control measures
Measures applied. Stamping out; Quarantine; Movement control inside
the country; Screening; Zoning; Disinfection of infected;
premises/establishment(s); Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of
affected animals

Measures to be applied. No other measures

[The last outbreak of classical swine fever in Mexico was in May and
November of 2005. Although it appears this outbreak is under control,
it is very difficult to get a picture of what happened during this
incident involving 2 farms. It appears as if there were disease events
as far back as March 2009 and yet this is the 1st report of the event.
It might have been helpful to have the test results for the 2 linked
farms given separately rather than aggregated as occurred in this
report.
