A viral disease is believed to have hit snow-bound Doben, Taryan, Sharanth, Grathnard and Bhatnard villages in the Lolab area some 35 kilometers [about 21.7 miles] from Kupwara [Jammu and Kashmir state]. Reports said that more than 250 people, most of them children, have fallen sick during the past 4 days [around 22-25 Jan 2014], while locals said 2 newborns have died due to the disease. "These patients had been diagnosed with upper and lower respiratory tract infection (RTI) with complaints of fever, cough and influenza, with redness in eyes. The symptoms seem [to be] of a cold-related viral disease," said a doctor who visited the area after the outbreak of the disease.

"Immediately after the reports of disease, we dispatched a medical team comprising a medical officer and paramedical staff to the area with necessary medicines. As there is no health centre in Doben village, our team treated more than 250 patients at Sharanth and provided free medicines to the patients and also did the immunization of children," said Dr Muhammad Tahir, Block Medical Officer [BMO] Sogam.

"The outbreak of the disease has caused panic in the area, as Doben and its adjoining villages are inaccessible due to snow, and there is no health centre around. For medicines, the locals have to walk 4 km [about 2.5 miles] up to Sharanth," said the local Sarpanch [village leader]. "There is no need to panic. We are monitoring the situation. If need arises we shall again send our teams to the area, though it is inaccessible due to snow," the BMO said.

[It seems likely that the mysterious (i.e., undiagnosed) viral respiratory disease is one of the ubiquitous acute respiratory diseases common in infancy, exacerbated by climatic and social conditions. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are classified as upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) or lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs). The upper respiratory tract consists of the airways from the nostrils to the vocal cords in the larynx, including the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear. The lower respiratory tract covers the continuation of the airways from the trachea and bronchi to the bronchioles and the alveoli. ARIs are not confined to the respiratory tract, however, and have systemic effects because of possible extension of infection or microbial toxins, inflammation, and reduced lung function. Diphtheria, pertussis, and measles are vaccine-preventable diseases that may have a respiratory tract component but also affect other systems.

Except during the neonatal period, ARIs are the most common causes of both illness and mortality in children under 5, who average 3 to 6 episodes of ARIs annually regardless of where they live or what their economic situation. However, the proportion of mild to severe disease varies between high- and low-income countries, and because of differences in specific etiologies and risk factors, the severity of LRIs in children under 5 is worse in developing countries, resulting in a higher case-fatality rate. Although medical care can to some extent mitigate both severity and fatality, many severe LRIs do not respond to therapy, largely because of the lack of highly effective antiviral drugs.

It is likely that the outbreak of disease in the Lolab area is a consequence of one of the common lower or upper respiratory tract infections and not some more exotic pathogen characteristic of this particular area; nonetheless, further information would be appreciated.

According to Wikipedia, Kupwara is a town and a notified area committee in Kupwara District in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Among the many tourist places in Kupwara, Lolab Valley has special significance. Sogam is a tehsil and a really beautiful place to visit for its meadows, mountains, gushing waters, and fresh air. - Mod.CP
