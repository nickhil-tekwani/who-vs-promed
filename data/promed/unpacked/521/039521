An outbreak of swine flu in Moreh, a town along the Manipur-Myanmar border, has killed several pigs. The district administration has banned import of pork and piglets from across the border till the situation was fully under control.

Locals told IANS on [7 Sept 2016] that the outbreak was reported a few days ago. One local woman, who lost all her 5 pigs, said: "First the pigs lost appetite and then developed lethargy. They showed drowsiness and eventually died."

Locals said they took the pigs to the veterinary hospital in the border town for treatment. However, the veterinarians there told them that there was no medicine or vaccine to contain the outbreak.

"The only fridge meant for preserving the vaccines and other medicines went out of order over 4 years back. When we went seeking help, we saw that some rats were inside the fridge," an agitated local resident said. Senior officials in Imphal told IANS that the situation was being closely monitored. "If the situation is not contained in a day or two, additional veterinarians will be rushed and vaccines would be airlifted from Delhi," an official said.

Pork is widely consumed in Manipur and is regularly imported from across the border. Following the outbreak of the disease, the import has been banned until further notice. Officials said that if the situation aggravates, culling may be ordered.

[According to the newswire above, no laboratory confirmation of swine flu virus subtype has been provided.

On 8 Sep 2016, Tripura News reported that "The district administration at Manipur has banned import of pork and piglets from across the border till the situation was fully under control. But North Tripura Border is still open without any checking via which in Damchara market every kinds of NE based items are selling". http://tripurainfoway.com/news-details/TN/64139/deadly-swine-flu-epidemic-hits-northeast-india-tripura-rsquo-s-dilapidated-health-sector-unprepared-corruption-tainted-hospitals-counterfeit-medicines-mark-cpi-m-rsquo-s-lsquo-golden-era-rsquo.html.

On May 2016 at least 1860 pigs died in the Mizoram-Myanmar border Champhai town and surrounding villages since the outbreak of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) http://www.theshillongtimes.com/2016/05/05/1860-pigs-die-of-prrs-in-mizoram-myanmar-border/.

Pigs are intermediate hosts for novel influenza generation and transfer to humans. Two lineages of H1N1 swine influenza viruses (SIVs), classical H1N1 SIVs and Eurasian avian-like H1N1 (EAH1N1) SIVs, have been circulating in pigs since 1918 and 1979, respectively. The classical H1N1 SIVs emerged in humans as a reassortant and caused the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.

In swine, an influenza infection produces fever, lethargy, sneezing, coughing, difficulty breathing and decreased appetite. In some cases the infection can cause abortion. Although mortality is usually low, the virus can produce weight loss and poor growth, causing economic loss to farmers.

The relationship between swine and human influenza disease has long been recognized as important. Pigs often are thought to be "mixing vessels" or to act as transmission agents in the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to mammals, including humans.

Influenza viruses are able to infect humans, swine, and avian species, and swine have long been considered a potential source of new influenza viruses that can infect humans.

In the absence of laboratory confirmation of the described incident and in view of the severity of the current disease in pigs, other etiological factors may, so far, not be excluded.
