The Health Department yesterday announced plans for a food hygiene drive as
the number of cholera cases reached its highest level in five years.
Another case was confirmed yesterday, bringing the number this year to 66.
Last year's total was 14. The department urged people to step up food
hygiene and said it would work with the Urban Council and Regional Council
to prevent a widespread outbreak.
The latest victim, a 71-year-old man, sought help from an clinic on
Saturday after feeling unwell. He was confirmed to have the disease
yesterday and was admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital for further
treatment. His condition was last night listed as satisfactory. Records
showed the man had not travelled abroad recently and he was believed to
have contracted the disease in Hong Kong. Another patient, a 68-year-old
man, was also suspected of having cholera. The man had checked in to the
Caritas Medical Centre, but when his condition deteriorated yesterday he
was transferred to Princess Margaret. He was placed in a segregated ward
where he was described as being in a serious condition.
Assistant Director of Health Dr Chan Wai-man confirmed yesterday the number
of cases this year was the highest since 1993. The increase was probably
caused by the weather - sudden rains and hot sunny spells could help spread
the bacteria, Dr Chan said. People should eat only well-cooked food to
reduce the risk of infection, she said.
