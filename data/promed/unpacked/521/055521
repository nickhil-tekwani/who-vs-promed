Malaria transmission increase on Mount Kenya
--------------------------------------------
According to a team of researchers funded by the UK Government's
Department for International Development (DfID), global warming is to
be blamed for the 7-fold increase in the malaria cases on Mount Kenya.

In the past 20 years, the average temperature on the mountain has
risen by 2-degrees Centigrade, allowing the disease to crop up in the
higher altitude areas, with the local population having no or little
immunity to the disease.

According to the researchers, the average temperature in the Kenyan
Central Highlands has risen from 17 deg C [62.6 deg F] in 1989 to 19
deg C [66.2 deg F] today.

Since the parasite matures only in temperatures above 18 deg C [64.4
deg F], it was absent from the region prior to the 1990s. However,
with average temperatures now above 18 deg C [64.4 deg F], malaria
epidemics have increased in the past decade, malaria-carrying
anopheles mosquitoes discovered in Naru Moro, which is over 6175 ft
(1900 m) above sea level in 2005.

Similar outbreaks elsewhere are also attributed to multiple factors
like resistance to drugs, including changes in the way land is used,
such as, changes in drainage systems, population explosion etc.,
though the only change in Mount Kenya has been the rise in temperature.

The change in temperature is being blamed on emissions from human
activity, rather than climatic changes due to natural causes. Rising
temperatures on the slopes of Mount Kenya have put an extra 4 million
people at risk of malaria, as the disease creeps into the higher
altitude areas.

Church meetings and local health clinics are being held for educating
people in high-altitude areas on how climate change could impact then
by spreading malaria into their area.

Extremely worrying, developing nations like Kenya need support to
help them tackle the potentially devastating impacts of climate change.

[A recent study from another area of Kenya (John CC et al: Possible
interruption of malaria transmission, highland Kenya, 2007-2008.
Emerg Infect Dis. 2009 Dec; 15(12): 1917-24;
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/15/12/pdfs/09-0627.pdf>) in highland
areas of Kipsamoite and Kapsisiywa, Kenya, found that after
introducing annual household indoor residual spraying with a
synthetic pyrethroid and artemether/lumefantrine was implemented in
2005 no microscopy-confirmed cases of malaria occurred at the sites
in 2007-2008, and less than 0.3 percent of persons were positive for
_Plasmodium falciparum_ by microscopy or PCR at any time.

A previous study (Chen et al: New records of _Anopheles arabiensis_
breeding on the Mount Kenya highlands indicate indigenous malaria
transmission. Malar J. 2006 Mar 7; 5:17;
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420308/>) found that
_Anopheles arabiensis_ in Karatina and Naro Moru on the highlands at
elevations of 1720-1921 m [5643-6303 ft] above sea level. Malaria
cases were recorded in the 2 highland locations in the past 10 years
with an increasing trend. The study concludes that local malaria
transmission on the Mount Kenya highlands is possible due to the
presence of _An. arabiensis_, and notes that malaria cases on the
highlands west of Mount Kenya have been noticed since 10-20 years ago.

study. - Mod.EP]
