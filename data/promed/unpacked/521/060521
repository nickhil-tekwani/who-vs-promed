Dr Peter English reports that: "In Surrey, UK, we have had some 29 cases of
measles in the past few weeks; 12 confirmed, and 17 probable cases awaiting
confirmation (or otherwise)." Dr English draws attention to the following
news report in the Health Protection Agency (HPA) CDR Weekly:
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/cdr/index.html> of Thu 23 Mar 2006:

Increase in measles cases in 2006, in England and Wales
-------------------------------------------------------
So far in 2006, 72 cases of measles have been confirmed in England and
Wales (weeks one to 11), compared with a total of 77 cases in the whole of
2005. Cases have occurred in all regions apart from the North East, and the
ages of cases have ranged from under one to 35 years of age. 2 cases had
received one dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and 3
others had been vaccinated with single measles vaccine (2 in South Africa).
Nine of the cases have been admitted to hospital, and there has been one
measles-related death in a boy aged 13 years who had an underlying lung
condition and was taking immunosuppressive drugs.
An outbreak of confirmed measles was 1st reported on a travelers' site in
2005 in Essex. Since then, there have been a number of outbreaks of measles
among the traveling community across England. Local health protection units
have been working with primary care trusts (PCTs) and the traveling
communities to minimize the impact of this outbreak. Vaccination coverage
in traveling communities has been historically low.
