Regarding ProMED-mail post 20070914.3060 the newswire stated
(<http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/local/story/4038307p-4647487c.html>:
[During the winter and spring of 2007, 128 elk were captured and
blood tested as part of the park's surveillance and monitoring
program. Of these, 3 animals tested positive for bovine TB on culture.]
I have never heard of any "blood culture's" being used to diagnose
tuberculosis in any species.
Do they mean some gamma-interferon test, perhaps?
And I wonder what samples the hunters collected, and for which
test(s), too, please?

With regard to the above ProMED-mail post, please can anyone advise
on the nature of the blood test referred to, along with its
sensitivity and specificity. TB is primarily transmitted as an
airborne disease, and the Manitoba Conservation programme requests
hunters to submit heads or lungs of shot animals which are then
examined for TB. Reference to a blood test is puzzling.

[The original article was less than plain regarding the testing on
the animals. The 'blood culture' referred to is the gamma interferon
test that uses blood to test for tuberculosis.
In this test, the release of a lymphokine (interferon gamma) in a
whole-blood culture system is measured. The assay is based on the
release of gamma-interferon from sensitised lymphocytes during a
16-24-hour incubation period with specific antigen (PPD-tuberculin).
The test makes use of the comparison of gamma-interferon production
following stimulation with avian and bovine PPD [purified protein
derivative]. The quantitative detection of bovine gamma-interferon is
carried out with a sandwich ELISA that uses two monoclonal antibodies
to bovine gamma-interferon. The blood sample must be transported to
the laboratory and the assay set up within 24-30 hours of collection.
The test is considered to have a high sensitivity compared with the
skin test, but it has proven to be less specific in a number of
trials. However, the use of defined mycobacterial antigens promises
to improve specificity (see reference below). In animals that are
difficult or dangerous to handle, such as excitable cattle or other
bovidae, the advantage over the skin test is that the animals need
only be captured once.
Reference: Buddle B.M., Ryan T.J., Pollock J.M., Anderson P. & De
Lisle G.W. (2001). Use of ESAT-6 in the interferon-gamma test for
diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis following skin testing. Vet.
Microbiol., 80, 37-46.

The gamma interferon test is equal to or better than the skin test,
but this moderator does not have a package insert to provide exact
numbers for sensitivity and specificity. However, the test has been
approved in the USA, the UK, Australia and the EU.
Although bovine TB is airborne, it does need to be in somewhat close
contact, as in nose to nose, not airborne in the traditional sense of
it spreading easily long distances.
This moderator is unable to comment on precisely what the Canadians
had submitted. Perhaps someone in the Canadian regulatory agency
would be so kind as to inform us. - Mod.TG]
