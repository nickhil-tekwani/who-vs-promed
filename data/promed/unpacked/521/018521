Multistate Outbreak of _Salmonella_ Kiambu Infections Linked to Yellow Maradol Papayas
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Kiambu infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE.

As of [ Fri 21 Jul 2017], 47 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Kiambu have been reported from 12 states.

States / Case Count
Iowa / 1
Kentucky / 1
Louisiana / 1
Maryland / 5
Massachusetts / 1
Minnesota / 1
New Jersey / 12
New York / 13
Pennsylvania / 4
Texas / 1
Utah / 1
Virginia / 6
Total / 47

WGS showed that isolates from people infected with _S._ Kiambu are closely related genetically. This close genetic relationship means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 May 2017 to 28 Jun 2017. Ill people range in age from less than one year to 95, with a median age of 27. Among ill people, 67 percent are female. Among 31 people with available information, 18 (58 percent) are of Hispanic ethnicity. Among 33 people with available information, 12 (36 percent) report being hospitalized. One death was reported from New York City.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence collected to date indicate that yellow Maradol papayas are a likely source of this multistate outbreak. This investigation is ongoing.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Eleven (44 percent) of 25 people interviewed reported eating papayas. This proportion was significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy Hispanic people in which 16 percent reported eating papayas in the months of May and June 2017 in the week before they were interviewed.

An illness cluster in Maryland was identified. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. In Maryland, several ill people reported eating papayas purchased from the same location of a grocery store. _S._ Kiambu and _S._ Thompson were isolated from samples collected from ill people. Investigating illness clusters provides critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there.

The Maryland Department of Health collected papayas from the grocery store associated with the illness cluster to test for _Salmonella_. One sample yielded the outbreak strain of _S._ Kiambu and another sample yielded _S._ Thompson. Both samples were from yellow Maradol papayas. WGS showed that the _S._ Kiambu papaya isolate is closely related genetically to the _S._ Kiambu isolates from ill people. This result provides more evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating contaminated yellow Maradol papayas. CDC is working to collect additional information to determine whether the recent _S._ Thompson illness in Maryland is part of this multistate outbreak.

Based on the available evidence, CDC recommends that consumers not eat, restaurants not serve, and retailers not sell yellow Maradol papayas until we learn more. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them. Further investigation is under way to determine the point in the supply chain where the papayas were contaminated. Updates will be provided when more information is available.

[Now that CDC has released its initial investigation report, the outbreak is clearly outside of just Maryland [see ProMED-mail post 20170721.5195333 - Mod.JH], but to date, most cases are located on the eastern seaboard.

The fruit of the papaya (also called papaw or pawpaw) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaya] is from the _Carica papaya_ , one of the 22 accepted species in the genus _Carica_ of the family Caricaceae. It is native to the tropics of the Americas, perhaps from southern Mexico and neighboring Central America. It was 1st cultivated in Mexico several centuries before the emergence of the Mesoamerican classical civilizations. Interestingly, papaya plants grow in 3 sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite. The male produces only pollen, never fruit. The female will produce small, inedible fruits unless pollinated. The hermaphrodite can self-pollinate since its flowers contain both male stamens and female ovaries. Almost all commercial papaya orchards contain only hermaphrodites. Two kinds of papayas are commonly grown. One has sweet, red or orange flesh, and the other has yellow flesh; in Australia, these are called "red papaya" and "yellow papaw", respectively. Either kind, picked green, is called a "green papaya". The large-fruited, red-fleshed 'Maradol', 'Sunrise', and 'Caribbean Red' papayas often sold in US markets are commonly grown in Mexico and Belize.
