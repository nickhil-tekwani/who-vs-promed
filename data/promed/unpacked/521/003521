From a previous post: [It is beyond me that people go to such lengths to
capture Vampire bats, smearing coagulant paste on there backs, so you can
see which cattle are bitten. Why not just inoculate them and notch there
wings so you know which ones are inoculated? It seems like such a waste to
watch cattle which have been fed upon by "coagulant treated bats" when you
could certainly stop the disease transmission by inoculating the carriers.
Cost of loosing livestock has definitely not been included in your "cost
beneficial" treatment of this problem.
Although Carlos Arellano Sota's <saec@entelchile.net> discussion of vampire
bat population control through various uses of anticoagulants clarified
that aspect of the questions above. Several issues it brings up are
interesting. I can understand why vampire bats are not captured and
vaccinated against rabies as a method of control. It might not be
particularly practical. However, if an oral vaccine was found to be
successful in vampire bats, potentially it could be delivered in a manner
similar to the way the anticoagulants are now delivered. At least one
recent study seems to indicate significant protection against rabies by at
least one oral rabies vaccine is short lived in vampires (Setien et al,
1998). Is further work progressing on this front?
Why is vaccination of cattle not used more as a part of the total control
strategy? It seems this might help in both protection of the cattle and in
breaking the cycle of transmission. Acha and Alba (1988) indicate this was
previously an important element of control strategy, but little mention
seems to be made of it more recently. Perhaps it is still extensively used,
but focus in the discussion and literature is on vampire bat population
reduction. I am not sure, perhaps someone directly involved can indicate if
it is still a common strategy.
In terms of cost-benefit analyses of rabies control programs, there has
certainly been some work and some certainly does take into account economic
losses of livestock. Acha and Alba (1988) provide useful data on that
aspect of vampire bats. However, Meltzer and Rupprecht (1998) recently
noted few adequate studies of the economics of rabies control have been
published.
