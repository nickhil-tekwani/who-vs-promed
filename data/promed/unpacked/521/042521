The Official Veterinary Services of Castilla-La Mancha [Castile-La Mancha] have notified the presence of serotype 4 of the bluetongue virus [BTV] in 2 sheep farms located in the municipalities of Alamillo and Guadalmez, south of the province of Ciudad Real, which has been confirmed by the Laboratory Algete Veterinary Center (LCV de Algete).

As reported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA), in both cases the animals had presented symptoms compatible with the disease in the previous days.

The municipalities of Alamillo and Guadalmez are located in the Almaden region, so far considered as a disease-free zone. In view of the verification of the circulation of the virus, the restriction zone for serotype 4 will be increased immediately by means of a Resolution that will be published in the coming days.

The restriction zone is extended to the following regions (see map 2 with updated restriction zone [included in the commentary]):
- In Andalusia: in the province of Cordoba, the regions of Penarroya-Pueblonuevo, Hinojosa del Duque (Pedroches II), Pozoblanco (Pedroches I), Villanueva de - Cordoba (Pedroches III) and Montoro (Alto del Guadalquivir).
- In Castilla-La Mancha: in the province of Ciudad Real, the regions of Almaden, Almodovar del Campo, and Piedrabuena.
- In Extremadura: in the province of Badajoz, the regions of Don Benito, Castuera, and Herrera del Duque.

The Ministry has reported that prevention, surveillance, and control measures in the area have been immediately reinforced and that mandatory vaccination against serotype 4 of the BTV will be administered for all animals older than 3 months of age of the ovine and bovine species in these [newly identified] territories.

In this way, restrictions have been established on the movements of animals of species sensitive to the disease, and passive surveillance has been reinforced, recalling the obligation to report any suspicion, as well as the disinfection of farms. An official notification has also been made to the European Commission, the rest of the Autonomous Communities, and sectors involved.

The 2 new outbreaks reported above are located in the southeastern province, Ciudad Real, within the hitherto unaffected autonomous community of Castilla-La Mancha. More precisely, they are adjacent to the junction point with 2 other autonomous communities, namely Andalusia and Extramadura. A map presenting the 2 outbreaks (red dots) is available at https://www.agropopular.com/wp-content/audios_agropopular/2021/10/cuadro-uno.jpg.

Autonomous communities constitute the 1st order (highest) level of territorial organization of Spain. Provinces are the 2nd-level territorial and administrative divisions of Spain.

The updated bluetongue [BT] restriction zones are presented in a map at https://www.agropopular.com/wp-content/audios_agropopular/2021/10/mapa-2.jpg. They include also Spain's Balearic Islands, in the Eastern Mediterranean, where the disease is spreading in Mallorca and Ibiza.

BTV-4 is currently circulating also in South Portugal, Tunisia, Sardinia, and Corsica. This serotype is regarded to be highly pathogenic for sheep of susceptible breeds.

Bluetongue, a vector-borne orbivirus, is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
