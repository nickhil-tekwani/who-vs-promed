[1] UK - vCJD statistics, April 2004

[Now that the incidence in the UK of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease --
abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- shows evidence of
having peaked, or reached a plateau, the full table of definite and
probable CJD cases and referrals will no longer be reproduced in
ProMED-mail. Only the variant CJD statistics will be posted unless there is
a substantial change in the situation. The full table updated monthly can
still be accessed at the Department of Health website. - Mod.CP]


Monthly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of Mon 5 Apr 2004
----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today issuing the latest information about the
numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This includes cases of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form of the disease thought
to be linked to BSE. The latest results (correct as at 5 Apr 2004) are the
following:

Summary of vCJD cases:

Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 104
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 36
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 140

Living Cases:
Number of definite/probable vCJD cases still alive: 6

Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 146

[These figures represent no net change in the total number of dead and
alive vCJD cases since last month. There has been no net change in the
figure for the past 2 months. The next table will be published on Tue 4 May
2004.

The precise definitions of the terms referrals, deaths, definite cases,
probable vCJD cases, sporadic, probable sporadic, iatrogenic, familial,
GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health website or by reference to a preceding ProMED-mail
post in this thread [for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002

[2] Tonsillectomy, NICE guidelines

Tonsillectomy, the use of diathermy, and vCJD - interim guidance from NICE
---------------------------------------------
The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has issued interim
guidance stating that surgeons who use diathermy in tonsillectomies should
consider changing the way they operate so that they minimize their use of
diathermy during tonsillectomies
<http://www.nice.org.uk/pdf/diathermytonsillectomyinterimguidance.pdf>. The
risk of complications may also be higher with currently available
disposable diathermy equipment for tonsillectomy and, again, surgeons
should consider discontinuing their use. Diathermy involves using a
high-frequency electrical current that passes through an area of the body
to produce heat to remove tonsils and/or to seal up the area where tonsils
are removed.

NICE has been asked by the chief medical officers (CMOs) of England,
Scotland, and Northern Ireland to review urgently the use of diathermy in
tonsillectomy. This follows an interim analysis of the results of the
National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit in England and Northern Ireland
carried out since July 2003 by the British Association of
Otorhinolaryngologists Head and Neck Surgeons (ENT UK) and the Clinical
Effectiveness Unit of The Royal College of Surgeons of England (CEU-RCS).
The audit was established to investigate the occurrence of hemorrhages and
other complications after tonsillectomy, as well as the risk factors that
may be involved including the type of instruments used, surgical
techniques, surgical experience, and patient factors.

The results of the audit suggest that there are higher risks of secondary
hemorrhage requiring re-admission and return to theatre after tonsillectomy
using diathermy techniques or coblation as compared with techniques that
use no diathermy either for dissection or for sealing the blood vessels
(the "cold steel" technique). It is this finding that has led to the
issuing of interim guidelines.

NICE has also been asked by the CMOs to develop guidance toward the best
technique for reducing any possible risks of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD) transmission, while minimizing the surgical complications of
tonsillectomy. Data from national audits will inform this guidance, and
ear, nose, and throat surgeons should continue to collect information about
patients who have tonsillectomies (provided that the patient agrees). These
data should be included in such audits.

In January 2001, the Department of Health (DH) had recommended that
single-use instruments should be used for adenotonsillectomy to minimize
the risk of transmission of vCJD. This followed DH advice describing the
present state of knowledge of vCJD transmission risk from one patient to
another (1,2). During the course of 2001, however, various difficulties
were highlighted with single-use instruments, and reports of both primary
and secondary hemorrhage after surgery increased. As a consequence, the DH
reintroduced standard reusable instruments for tonsil and adenoid surgery
(3). After a review has been undertaken which will take into account data
from the Scottish National Tonsillectomy Audit, and once an evaluation of
disposable instruments that is being carried out in Wales has been
completed, definitive guidance on the use of diathermy in tonsillectomy
will be issued by NICE. Once they become available, full details on the
time scale for developing guidance on the use of diathermy in tonsillectomy
as well as the best technique for reducing any possible risks of vCJD
transmission will be published on the NICE website <http://www.nice.org.uk/ip>.

A letter from Professor Richard Ramsden (president elect, ENT UK and
chairman of the National Steering Group of the National Prospective
Tonsillectomy Audit) summarises the results for 5 popular tonsillectomy
techniques
