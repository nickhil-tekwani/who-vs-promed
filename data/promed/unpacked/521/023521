[Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever is caused by Guanarito virus, a rodent-borne virus. It is a Select Agent on CDC's bioterror list (see http://www.selectagents.gov/Select%20Agents%20and%20Toxins%20List.html), but there is no suspicion that any of these sporadic cases were unnatural occurrences.

The other viral hemorrhagic fever endemic in Venezuela is yellow fever. According to the same Table, no human cases of YF (fiebre amarilla) were recorded in the country between 2010 and 2012. A number of monkey deaths in late 2010, which are usually a sign of active YF transmission in the jungle, were reported in the Venezuelan press (see ProMED-mail archive below).

Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever has occurred sporadically in that country, with a 40 per cent case fatality rate. The disease is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, sore throat, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally convulsions.

The rodent reservoirs are the cotton rat _Sigmodon alstoni_ and the cane mouse _Zygodontomys brevicauda_. Guanarito virus is an arenavirus related to 2 other South American arenaviruses that are of significant public health concern: Machupo virus (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever) and Junin virus (Argentinean hemorrhagic fever).

An image of _Sigmodon alstoni_ can be accessed at http://monde.des.mammiferes.free.fr/Placentaires/Rodentia/Cricetidae/Sigmodon%20hispidus.jpg and of _Zygodontomys brevicauda_ at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/resources/Heideman_Paul/Zygod_brevicauda/medium.jpg.
