A virus that has killed 6 people in the past 2 weeks may be the same
strain of the West Nile virus that was also observed in the north of
Greece, doctors say, as most of the symptoms resemble those presented
in patients with the West Nile virus.

The Turkish Health Ministry announced that 6 out of the 16 patients
who have come to the Manisa State Hospital since 12 Aug [2010] [with]
fever, thrombocytopenia (lack of blood clotting cells), altered
states of consciousness, and skin eruptions have died. The statement
also announced that a scientific committee was rapidly set up
following reports from the Manisa State Hospital's infectious
diseases experts. The committee is composed of experts from the
Health Ministry's Fundamental Health Services General Directorate,
the Refik Saydam National Public Agency (RSHM), which deals with
bacteria and viral disease prevention, and academics from relevant
medical backgrounds.

The statement said the medical cases were currently being evaluated
by doctors, adding that a field inspection was also under way. The
committee is also investigating possible cases that might have gone
unreported and has laid out a strategy for managing a potential
outbreak. The committee has been working for a full diagnosis and to
determine treatment options. The statement said, "Whether the cases
in Manisa bears any resemblance to the mosquito-born West Nile virus
cases observed in the north of Greece is being investigated
separately in cooperation with international health agencies."

RSHM President Mustafa Ertek said they started working on identifying
the virus 10 days ago, following a notification from the Manisa State
Hospital. Ertek said, "Currently, there is a West Nile epidemic in
the north of Greece. Minor West Nile epidemics have also been
observed in countries such as Morocco and Algeria. It is not a
contagious disease, but it can be transmitted to another patient
through blood transfusion. The symptoms in the Manisa cases resemble
the West Nile strain that was recently detected in northern Greece."
However, he added that they would have to wait for laboratory results
to make a definite identification.

[West Nile (WN) virus has been circulating in some areas of the
Mediterranean Basin this year (2010). It is possible that West Nile
(WN) virus has turned up in Manisa, Turkey, perhaps brought in by
wild birds as they begin their post-fledging, migratory movements.
Manisa is across the Aegean Sea from Greek Macedonia, where a WN
outbreak is occurring, and somewhat inland. However, until the
laboratory results are in, the WN virus etiology of this outbreak and
possible relationships to the WN virus occurring in Greek Macedonia
is speculative. If WN virus is confirmed, this will be the 1st report
of the virus in Turkey that ProMED-mail has posted. ProMED awaits
those results with interest.
