[In 2019, India reported several cases of HPAI subtypes H5N1. Detailed information on each event reported during 2019 is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Countryreports. To see this information, select country and year and click on the event.

"People who are in close contact with infected birds are at risk for acquiring avian influenza. While many human cases are limited to conjunctivitis or mild respiratory disease, some viruses tend to cause severe illness.

"However, there is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of poultry or eggs fit for human consumption could transmit the AI virus to humans. As a precautionary and regulatory measure, animals that have been culled as a result of measures to control an AI outbreak should not be allowed to enter the human food and animal feed chain, and precautionary measures for the cleaning and cooking process should be respected."
