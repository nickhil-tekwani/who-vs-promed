The number of dengue fever patients in Thailand's lower northeastern provinces is 4 times higher in the 1st 5 months of this year [2013] compared to last year [2012].

From 1 Jan-31 May 2013, the number of patients was recorded at 3544 cases, 4 times last year's [2012] figure, with 9 deaths being reported, said Dr Sarayuth Uttamangkapong, director of the local disease control office in Ubon Ratchathani [province].

Si Sa Ket [province] reported the most patients with 1086. Local authorities have taken stringent measures to rid residential areas of mosquitoes.

Meanwhile, in the capital, the department of the disease control worked with the Yaemsaard Rangsit School [Pathum Thani province] in launching a campaign against dengue fever, as Thailand's dengue patient tally is the 2nd highest in ASEAN countries, Singapore being first.

The patient numbers in the country tripled last year's [2012] figure. It could reach 150 000 cases this year [2013] and the fatalities could rise to 100-150. So far, the deaths from dengue fever were recorded at about 50, according to the department.

Dengue fever has hit 4374 Bangkok residents and claimed one life in the capital during the past 6 months.

The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration has implemented a variety of measures in a bid to control the disease.

"We will spray chemicals to kill mosquitoes, the carrier of the disease. The next round of spraying will run from [Thu 20 Jun 2013] until 30 Jun [2013]," Bangkok Governor MR Sukhumbhand Paribatra said yesterday [17 Jun 2013].

He was speaking at the Mahanak Mosque in the capital's Pom Prab district. Of all the communities in the district, the Mahanak community has the 2nd highest incidence of dengue.

According to Sukhumbhand, monthly surveys are now conducted to identify mosquito-breeding grounds, which will be eliminated. "We will also pay special attention to risky places like schools, religious sites and medical facilities. Such places need strict measures to ensure the eradication of mosquito breeding grounds," he added.
