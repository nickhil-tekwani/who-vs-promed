The Ministry of Health [Peru has issued a health alert in the border city
of Tacna [Peru due to the presumed appearance of Hanta virus in the
Chilean port of Arica, 60 Km south.
Dr. Mario Chiu Chiu, Director General of Epidemiology of the Ministry of
Health [Peru, reported that in several cities in Chile such as Punta
Arenas, Santiago, Iquique, and Arica, there have now been 19 cases of the
disease reported; the virus has an incubation period of 7 to 17 days.
The Peruvian Director General of Health, Pedro Sakuray, disclosed that
officials in Arica [Chile informed him that a 23 year old male patient
died in the last few days with symptoms of Hantavirus, and that blood
samples have been sent to a laboratory in Valdivia in the south of Chile as
well as to the laboratory in the hospital of Carlos Malbran in Buenos
Aires, Argentina.
"We are not going to wait for the results of those analyses. We have to
take immediate action," Dr. Sakuray said. Laura Urteaga, Chief of Zoonosis
of the General Directorate of Environmental Health, announced a campaign to
control rats among areas of the city of Tacna [Peru, trains and all
vehicles carrying commerce over the border from Chile, the train station,
as well as goods coming into Tacna from Chilean ports to the town of
Ceticos-Zotac. In addition, she reported the closure of the fish terminal
and major market in the city for three days for fumigation.
Regarding the pilgrimage to the sanctuary of Our Lord of Locumba, that is
celebrated on the 13th and 14th of this month, by the arrival of about
5,000 citizens of Arica [Chile, Dr. Sakuray said that all vehicles making
the journey will be fumigated thoroughly.
Chip News, Santiago Chile, of 5 September 1997, reported a number of cases
of Hantavirus in southern Chile which is the suspected cause of death of a
5-year-old boy Wednesday in Coihaique, and the virus is suspected in six
cases in the last three weeks. La Nacion [Chile reported that the boy's
death brings to nine the number of Chileans the Hantavirus has killed since
its reappearance in Chile in 1995.
On Tuesday, medical officials in Region XI and XII asked national health
authorities to send resources and take measures to stop the spread of the
disease. "The doctors that are here in Aisen are worried about the advance
of this virus in this area. For this reason we ask the government to form a
commission at the highest level to confront the health problem with action,
not study," said Claudio Vallejos, president of the Medical Association in
Aisen, Region XI.[Chile
