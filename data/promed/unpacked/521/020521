The Health Protection Agency (HPA) has said 4 people have tested
positive for a mild strain of bird flu, which was 1st detected at a
north Wales smallholding. A 1 km (0.62 mi) restriction zone remains
in place around the farm in Conwy after the "low pathogenic" H7N2
strain of bird flu was found in chickens, which died there. Tests
were carried out on 9 people associated with the incident; [4 tested
positive and the other 5 negative.] Of the 9, 3 were taken to
hospital but have now been discharged.
Health officials have stressed the disease found was the H7N2 strain
of bird flu, not the more virulent H5N1. In almost all human cases to
date, the H7N2 infection has generally been associated with a mild
disease and the risk to the general public is considered to be very
low, they added.
Of the 4 people who tested positive, 2 were from Wales and the other
2 were from northwest England. The owners of the smallholding, Tony
Williams and Barbara Cowling, have tested negative. However,
officials said this did not mean they had not been exposed to the
virus, and further investigations were being carried out on their specimens.
Professor Pat Troop, chief executive of the Health Protection Agency,
said those who were associated with the infected or dead birds and
had reported flu-like symptoms were tested "as a precaution." "These
test results confirm that human infection with the avian flu virus
has occurred. The cases so far have been associated with the infected
birds," Prof Troop said. "It is important to remember that H7N2 avian
flu remains largely a disease of birds. The virus does not transmit
easily to humans. "Worldwide, almost all human H7N2 infections
documented so far, including those associated with this most recent
incident, have been associated with infected poultry."
Dr Marion Lyons from the National Public Health Service (NPHS) for
Wales said the source of the outbreak was clearly identified as the
chickens on the smallholding, which had all been culled. "For most of
the people we have found with symptoms, the illness has been mild.
"We are contacting everyone who has been in close contact with the
people who are ill, so people who are not contacted by us should not
worry. "As is usual, we would advise anyone who is concerned about
their health to consult their GP (general practitioner)."
Chief Medical Officer for Wales, Dr Tony Jewell, said: "I would like
to reassure the general public that the risk to their health from
this outbreak is very low. This particular strain is not highly
pathogenic and is normally only contracted following close contact
with infected birds. In addition the symptoms are generally mild."
All people known to have been in contact with the infected birds, or
to have visited the farm, have been given anti-viral drugs.
The bird flu was confirmed at the farm at Llanfihangel Glyn Myfyr,
near Cerrigydrudion on Thursday [24 May 2007]. The owners had bought
15 Rhode Island Red chickens 2 weeks ago, but all the birds had since
died. Samples from the dead birds were 1st sent for testing on 17 May
2007, and 30 others on the site were later slaughtered. Wales's chief
vet, Dr Christianne Glossop, said it was a "top priority" to find the
source of the disease. This is the 1st confirmed case of bird flu in
Wales. The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs
(Defra) would like to hear from anyone -- who has not already been
contacted -- who purchased from or supplied to Chelford Market,
Cheshire on 7 May 2007, or any poultry keeper who visited Chelford
Market on that day whose birds have subsequently become ill. They are
asked to contact their local Animal Health Office or the Defra
helpline 08459 33 55 77. Lines are open between 0900 BST and 1700
BST, 7 days a week.

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) confirmed today [25 May 2007], 4
people have tested positive for bird flu after an outbreak of the
virus on a north Wales farm. Dr Christianne Glossop, Chief Veterinary
Officer for Wales, previously said it was not the most dangerous H5N1
strain but H7N2 low pathogenic avian influenza. HPA carried out tests
on specimens from 9 people associated with the incident -- 7 from
Wales and 2 from northwest England. Of the 4 positive results, 2 were
from Wales and 2 were from northwest England. The remaining 5 were
negative, the HPA said.
Yesterday [24 May 2007], 30 chickens were slaughtered at the
smallholding in Corwen after 15 birds died. The dead birds were
22-week-old Rhode Island Red chickens, which were bought by the
smallholding 2 weeks ago. One of the new chickens died the day after
it was taken to the farm and all later died. Tests were carried out
after the farm's owners contacted their own vet. A 1km (0.62 mi)
restriction zone was been set up around the farm, stopping birds and
bird products being moved in or out of the area. Everyone entering
the site has been taking flu drug Tamiflu as a precaution.
Pat Troop, chief executive of the Health Protection Agency, said: "As
a routine precaution, we have tested those who were associated with
the infected or dead birds and reported flu-like symptoms. We tested
samples from 9 people in our laboratories and confirmed infection in
4. These test results confirm that human infection with the avian flu
virus has occurred. The cases so far have been associated with the
infected birds." She said it was important to remember that H7N2
avian flu remains largely a disease of birds. "The virus does not
transmit easily to humans. Worldwide, almost all human H7N2
infections documented so far, including those associated with this
most recent incident, have been associated with infected poultry."
Three of the 9 people were treated in hospital but were later
discharged. The National Public Health Service for Wales and HPA
North West is tracing and following up all close contacts of the
individuals who have been ill as a "precautionary measure." Dr
Glossop said yesterday: "Wales and Great Britain contingency plans
have been activated and in line with these the farm has been placed
under restrictions. We are not yet asking bird keepers within the
zone to bring their birds indoors." Investigations are being carried
out into the source of the outbreak and Dr Glossop urged poultry
keepers to look out for signs of disease in their birds. She said:
"As the jigsaw puzzle becomes clearer we may put restraints on
holdings in other parts of Britain.
Dr Mike Simmons, senior medical officer for Wales, has said there was
a large enough supply of Tamiflu to provide a 5-day treatment course
for a quarter of the population of Wales. Supplies of the flu drug
have been delivered to the local health board for the affected area.
Dr Simmons previously said there was no ongoing risk to the public,
and added: "We do not anticipate this virus transmogrifying into the
H5 strain, but it's not impossible."
Dr Glossop added that the infected chickens were egg producers and
there were investigations going on to trace what had left the farm
and come on to the farm in recent weeks. The Food Standards Agency
(FSA) said no one eating eggs from the infected poultry was at risk
of contracting the virus.
The National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS) said virologists
had advised that the 5 people who had not tested positive should also
be considered to have had the H7 influenza virus. It said 23 people
have been identified who have been in contact with the chickens on
the smallholding in the last 7 days or with people who have been ill.
They included 6 Animal Health staff who tested and culled the
chickens. A statement from NPHS for Wales said that of the 23, 9 have
symptoms compatible with conjunctivitis and/or a flu like illness.
Swabs were taken from 7 people and sent to the HPA laboratory. It
said: "Most of the cases demonstrate spread of the infection from
poultry to people. However, there is one case where there may not
have been spread fro poultry to the person so, as a result, we are
managing the outbreak on the assumption that spread within the
household setting may also have occurred. We are now contacting all
the close contacts of each of the people who is ill."
Dr Marion Lyons, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control at the
NPHS for Wales, said: "The source of the outbreak of illness is
clearly identified as the chickens on the smallholding. These have
all been culled so the original source has been destroyed. Although
the number of people involved is very small, we could be dealing with
some spread of the H7 flu virus within the household setting. We are
treating this possibility very seriously. For most of the people we
have found with symptoms, the illness has been mild. However, we know
that 3 people have been admitted to, and subsequently discharged
from, hospital. We are contacting everyone who has been in close
contact with the people who are ill so people who are not contacted
by us should not worry."
The Welsh Assembly Government said the owners of the smallholding
have tested negative for the H7N2 strain of the disease -- but this
does not mean they have not been exposed to the virus. Further
investigations are being carried out on their specimens.
