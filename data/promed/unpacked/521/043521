Florida Man Hospitalized With Anthrax
--------------------------------------
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. A 63-year-old businessman has been hospitalized in
Florida with pulmonary anthrax, a highly lethal disease mentioned as a
possible biological weapon. But U.S. Health Secretary Tommy Thompson said
Thursday there is no evidence this case was a result of terrorism. "This is
an isolated case and it's not contagious," Thompson said at a White House
news conference. He said such incidents are "rare, very rare."
Anthrax has been developed by some countries as a possible biological
weapon. But the disease can be contracted naturally; the bacterial spores
can be found in soil and are often carried by livestock. Officials said the
Florida victim is an avid outdoorsman.
Thompson said the last U.S. case of anthrax was earlier this year in Texas.
But that case was not pulmonary anthrax, in which the disease settles in
the lungs.
The Lantana, Fla., man, whose name was not released, checked into a
hospital on Tuesday and it was initially believed he had meningitis, Lt.
Gov. Frank Brogan said. But X-rays and other testing showed that it was
pulmonary anthrax. The disease is treated with antibiotics. Brogan said the
man had recently traveled to North Carolina and became ill shortly after he
returned. The incubation period for the disease can be [as long as] 60 days.
Tim O'Connor, spokesman for the Palm Beach health department, said the case
is "very likely" to be fatal.
Anthrax is a spore-forming bacterium that is especially virulent if
inhaled. The disease causes pneumonia. There is a vaccine to prevent the
spread of the disease. All forms are rare, but the most recent cases --
including ones in Texas and North Dakota -- have been cutaneous cases
resulting from handling [skinning] animals [that died of anthrax.]
During the 20th century, only 18 cases of inhaled anthrax have been
reported in the United States, the most recent in 1976.
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI are
investigating.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGE REGARDING ANTHRAX CASE
The Florida State Department of Health and the CDC are investigating a case
of anthrax in a 63-year-old male Florida resident. The diagnosis is
confirmed by CDC's laboratory. So far this appears to be an isolated case.
Anthrax is not contagious. The illness is not transmitted person to person.
Sporadic cases of anthrax do occur in the United States, so a single case
is not an indication of an outbreak. The last case of anthrax reported in
the United States was earlier this year in Texas. The rapid identification
of this single case is the result of the heightened level of disease
monitoring being done by the public health and medical community. This is
the disease monitoring system in action. Right now, there is no suggestion
of other possible cases, but we are aggressively checking to see if other
people are similarly ill.
The Florida State Health Department and a team from CDC are aggressively
investigating the source of infection. They are reconstructing the
patient's schedule for the last few weeks to attempt to determine the
location where the patient may have been exposed. A team of CDC
epidemiologists were sent to Florida to look for any indications of
exposure to this disease. Medical teams and supplies are prepared to be
moved quickly if needed.
CDC and state health officials are alerting health care providers to look
for unusual cases of respiratory disease. Although anthrax starts out with
flu-like symptoms, it rapidly progresses to severe illnesses, including
pneumonia and meningitis.
If anyone has been exposed, antibiotics are the appropriate preventive
treatment. CDC has an emergency supply of antibiotics readily available for
distribution. If the investigation of the cause of this illness indicated
that you need antibiotics, your state and local health department will
notify you and your physician and will assure you receive the drugs. Based
on what we know right now, there is no need for people to take any
extraordinary actions or steps. They should not go to a doctor or hospital
unless they are sick. They should not buy and horde medicines or
antibiotics. They should not buy gas masks.
The public needs to understand that our public health system is on a
heightened sense of alert for any diseases that may come from a biological
attack. So we may have more reports of what may appear to be isolated
cases. We're going to respond more aggressively to these cases than in the
past.

Florida Man Has Anthrax, 63-Year-Old Hospitalized
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 63-year-old Florida man hospitalized with pulmonary anthrax is an
"isolated case" with no evidence of terrorism, Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy Thompson said today. "Officials are aggressively
investigating the individual's schedule for the last few weeks and the
source of the infection," Thompson said. The Centers for Disease Control
and the FBI are investigating. White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said
officials know of no threat made in connection with the case.
Anthrax has been discussed as a possible agent in a potential biological
attack by terrorists, but it also is a naturally occurring bacterium that
has caused past human infections. The infections often are fatal. At least
2 other human cases have been identified since 1974, including one in
Florida, officials said. Thompson said the most recent case was of a man in
Texas earlier this year.
Health officials said the British-born patient from Lantana, Fla., near
Tallahassee, whose name was not released, was admitted to an undisclosed
hospital early Tuesday. They suspected he had meningitis until lab results
indicated he had pulmonary anthrax. The patient was described as an
outdoorsman who recently drank from an outdoor stream, and who recently
traveled in North Carolina.
"There is no reason to think that this incident is anything other than what
we have seen in the United States over recent years," Florida Lt. Gov.
Frank Brogan said. "It is a rare illness but it has manifested itself in
Florida many years ago, as well as other states in the country in more
recent years. And there is no reason to believe at this juncture that this
is anything other than the manifestation of a rare and obviously very
serious illness that has found its way into the life of one individual."
Anthrax infections are more commonly found in soil, sheep, cattle and
horses, but can spread to humans who come into physical contact with
infected animals or their products, or by breathing in anthrax spores. The
current Florida case, the most serious type of anthrax, involves inhaling
spores.
"I want to make sure that everybody understands that anthrax is not
contagious, and is not communicable, which means it is not spread from
person to person," Thompson said. "If it is caught early enough, it can be
prevented and treated with antibiotics. There's plenty of [antibiotic]
supply available." Thompson added that there was enough to treat 2 million
people for 60 days. "People should not go out of their way and do anything
other than what they're doing."
Animal Anthrax
Before the human case was announced, Martin Hugh-Jones, a professor at
Louisiana State University's College of Veterinary Medicine, said the
summer has been a relatively quiet one for anthrax cases in animals, though
there were outbreaks. "This year we're at the end of a very bad outbreak in
northern Minnesota, a small outbreak in South Dakota and one outbreak in
Alberta [Canada]," he said. "There were also a whole lot of dead deer with
the disease found in west Texas. Last year was a bad year - about 250
animals [livestock & bison] died from it," he said. "But overall, it's not
a major problem - especially compared to, say, parasites, pneumonia."
[All I have been able to gather, in addition to these reports is that he
was at Duke University, in North Carolina, last Wednesday visiting his son.
On Sunday he developed a severe headache and fever. He & his wife started
driving back on Monday and he checked into hospital on Tuesday morning.
Bacilli were found in his CSF. But for some reason as yet unclear a chest
X-ray was taken presumably showing pathognomonic signs of pneumonic
anthrax. I am surprised he has survived as long as he has as the systemic
infection symptoms date from Sunday. I would repeat, however, that this
disease responds extremely well to antibiotics in the early pre-systemic
stages when the symptoms are mild. The Palm Beach hospital physicians are
to be congratulated on spotting this case. - Mod.MHJ]
[Clinical microbiology laboratories should not regard isolates of
_Bacillus_ species that are recovered from clinical specimens as
"contaminants" but should instead further evaluate the isolates. If an
isolate of _Bacillus_ is non-motile and non-hemolytic, the isolate should
be tested further by an appropriate laboratory, such as a state public
health laboratory or the CDC, that is able to identify _B. anthracis_ on
the basis of specialized testing. - Man. Ed. DS]
