["Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is characterised by reproductive failure of sows and respiratory problems of piglets and growing pigs. The disease is caused by the PRRS virus (PRRSV), a virus currently classified as a member of the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus _Arterivirus_. The primary target cells of the virus are differentiated macrophages of the pig, mainly alveolar but also present in other tissues. 2 major antigenically different types of the virus exist: type 1 (previously described as European - EU) and type 2 (previously North American - NA). Historically, type 1 was restricted to Europe and type 2 to North America; currently they are spread globally. The virus is primarily transmitted via direct contact but also by contact with faeces, urine, semen, and fomites. The possibility of insect vectors (houseflies and mosquitos) and aerogenic spread for short distances has also been confirmed. PRRS occurs in most major pig-producing areas throughout the world. The reproductive failure is characterised by infertility, late fetal mummification, abortions, stillbirths, and the birth of weak piglets that often die soon after birth from respiratory disease and secondary infections. Older pigs may demonstrate mild signs of respiratory disease, usually complicated by secondary infections. In 2006, a highly pathogenic PRRSV strain emerged in China (People's Rep. of) causing high fever (40-42 deg C [104-107.6 deg F) in all age groups, abortions in sows, and high mortality in sucking piglets, weaners, and growers.

"The virus does not pose a zoonotic risk and it is not infectious for humans or for cells of human origin."
