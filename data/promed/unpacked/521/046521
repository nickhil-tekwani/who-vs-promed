[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much of the
Eastern seaboard of the United States, most reports on West Nile virus
infection in year 2002 will be combined and presented as an "update" at
regular, but not more frequent than weekly, intervals determined by the
volume of such reports. As previously, however, reports of human infection,
infection of new hosts, extension of geographical range, and events of
special significance will be posted immediately on receipt. - Mod.CP]

First West Nile virus infected bird of the year confirmed in Washington DC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Mon 13 May 2002, Washington reported its first West Nile virus (WNV)
infected bird of the year. It was found on Wed 1 May 2002 in Connecticut
Avenue NW, a block from the National Zoo, and tested positive on 6 May 2002
at a Maryland Health Department Laboratory in Baltimore. The city recorded
360 infected birds last year.
Maryland so far has had no reports of infected birds, officials said
yesterday, though the state's active virus surveillance has started. Last
year, Maryland's first infected birds were reported in May, and the state
eventually recorded 454.
Virginia has recorded 2 WNV infected birds this year: one found on 8 Apr
2002 in Arlington County, the second on 19 Apr 2002 in Fairfax County, a
health department spokeswoman said yesterday. That is 3 months earlier than
the appearance of the state's first bird infection last year, when the
state logged 215 such birds.
The Washington area's only human West Nile infections last year were in
Maryland, where there were 6 cases and 2 fatalities. Both deaths were of
people suffering from other maladies.
[This year] the virus has cropped up in wildlife in Florida, Pennsylvania,
Louisiana, Florida, and Illinois. Last year, it spread up and down the East
coast and out to the Midwest. Experts have said they expect its spread to
continue rapidly. West Nile Virus, which first appeared in the United
States in New York City in 1999, is generally not dangerous in humans. Most
infected people suffer no ill effects. In some infirm or elderly people,
though, it can cause potentially fatal encephalitis. Birds, especially
crows, have been the chief victims of the virus, for reasons that
scientists don't yet understand. The mortality rate for infected crows
still is about 97 per cent, experts said yesterday. Raptors, blue jays, and
other types of birds are also affected, as are horses. Zoos across the
country have been especially alarmed by the virus because it has claimed
several dozen captive birds at the Bronx Zoo in New York and at the
Philadelphia Zoo. After infected crows were found on the grounds of the
National Zoo last year, officials inoculated the zoo's zebras with an
equine vaccine that had just been made available, zoo pathologist Donald
Nichols said yesterday. A spokesperson for the Bronx Zoo said yesterday
that the vaccine is being tested on penguins and flamingos there.
Residents can now report suspicious dead bird sightings to the state
[Maryland] through the internet [], as
well as over the state's dead bird hot line: 1-866-866-CROW. District
residents can report suspicious dead birds to the West Nile Virus Call
Center at 202-535-2323. Virginians who spot suspicious dead birds may call
their county health department.

New Jersey: West Nile virus kills 3 crows in Monmouth County
------------------------------------------------------------
Monmouth County has become New Jersey's early-season leader in collecting
dead crows that have tested positive for West Nile virus, the
mosquito-borne virus that sometimes kills humans as well as birds. The head
of the county's Mosquito Extermination Commission said yesterday that 3
birds' carcasses found here have tested positive this year. Only one other
positive result has been reported in New Jersey. That was in Morris County,
said Douglas Guthrie Sr, superintendent for the mosquito commission.
The Shore area crows were found in Howell, Tinton Falls, and Ocean Township
between 16 Apr and 3 May 2002. "The findings tend to be earlier this year
than years past but we've not really figured out exactly why," Guthrie
said. "There could be several factors. I think perhaps that mosquitoes are
out earlier this year because we've had warmer weather. But also, this is
the fourth year of dealing with West Nile virus and our surveillance is
more refined. We're getting information sooner."
Last year in New Jersey, there were 12 confirmed cases of humans
contracting the virus. State epidemiologist Dr Eddy Bresnitz said one of
those infected, a 45 year old Carteret man whose identity was never
disclosed, died in early October 2001.
Mosquitoes pick up the disease from infected birds, but the origin of the
virus is unknown, officials have said. "Crows are certainly the best early
indicator that the virus is present in an area. The fact that we have 3 WNV
positive crows this early in the season certainly confirms that the virus
is endemic and that it is here to stay," Guthrie said.

New York: first West Nile virus positive dead bird reported

As of 16 May 2002 the Wadsworth Laboratory reported a positive result for 1
dead bird (Albany 1). This is the first WNV positive bird for 2002 in New
York State this year.
