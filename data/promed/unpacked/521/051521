The general director of veterinary services in the Ministry of Agriculture in Gaza, Zakaria Kafarneh, has said: "The ministry has culled during the past 2 days 8500 chickens infected with bird flu on 3 farms located in the Nuseirat area and Deir al-Balah (central Gaza Strip).

Kafarneh added that "the chicken culling came after the completion of all the procedures and medical tests that proved the disease."

On the reason for the emergence of the disease, he said: "Research and analysis show that the farms hit by the flu are located near a duck farm which is suspected as source of infection." He explained that the infected ducks do not show disease signs, in contrast to chickens where the disease causes serious clinical signs. In spite of absence of clinical disease, such ducks should be culled.

Kafarneh urged the competent veterinary authorities in Ramallah (West Bank) to urgently communicate with the ministry in Gaza in order to put an end to this disease before it spreads, pointing out that his ministry in Gaza lacks budgetary means to allow the required compensation to the owners of culled birds. Without safeguarded compensations, information from farmers may become incomplete and delayed.

He called upon citizens and farm owners to notify the ministry immediately in case of suspected symptoms of the disease while keeping the birds on farm, refraining from moving them to prevent spread, stressing that crews from the ministry are working with their maximal strength in the fight against any outbreak of the disease.

[A serious problem in the densely populated Gaza strip is the presence of numerous backyard holdings in both rural and urban areas. Control of HPAI in such holdings is a complex undertaking.

Information on the genotype involved is requested; in case it is, as suspected, similar to the virus clade 2.2.1.2 with putative human health impact, circulating in Egypt, severe measures should be applied to protect exposed humans.

Hopefully, Dr Kafarneh's call for assistance from the central veterinary authorities in Ramallah is addressed the earliest. Addressing other agencies, including FAO and the reference laboratory for poultry diseases in the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit Dagan, in neighbouring Israel, deserve to be considered as well.

The 2015 epizootic of HPAI H5N1 in the territories of the Palestinian Authority and Israel started in January 2015; for an interactive map showing the locations of all outbreaks reported by both parties since January 2015, please go to http://tinyurl.com/q64kpuf (click on the Eastern Mediterranean cluster and zoom in). - Mod.AS
