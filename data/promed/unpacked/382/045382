Control of Rabies by Canine and Wild-life Vaccination in Austria
----------------------------------------------------------------
A far as I know there was no rabies case neither in domestic animals nor in
wild-life in Austria for more than 2 years: an effect of vaccination,
using the oral vaccine to prevent infection in foxes and other wild-life.
Those looking up the map of registered cases in Europe will find that
Austria is a white spot surrounded by countries (mainly north, east and
south) with plenty of cases (animals crossing the borders been vaccinated as
well?).
Supporting poorer countries by providing Raboral could save many
lives - having an immunized (dog) community could be better than killing
them having the same problem repeatedly after a few months.

Some Observations on Feral Dogs in North America
------------------------------------------------
Years ago, I lived in a small community on the Canadian border, where pet
dogs were free-roaming and in general, unvaccinated. While rabies in that
severe climate was not a large concern, the behavior of the dogs was
frightening, especially in winter when the frigid weather made them very
bad-tempered.
These dogs would congregate in large packs and act very threateningly
towards pedestrians. It was not uncommon to see a pack of 20 or more dogs,
who became feral in behavior when in such large numbers, even though
presumably most or all of them returned to domesticated behavior in their
owners' homes at night, when they were called in. It seemed to me at the
time that individual pedestrians, and in particular small children, were at
great risk of attack, and in fact I was scared badly more than once by a
threatening pack. Complaining to the local constabulary (there were 2
policemen in town) did no good at all.
I watched a pack of them run down and kill a deer on the frozen river that
flowed behind the house where I lived. It wasn't too big a stretch to see
them behaving similarly towards people, even though it could be argued that
deer represent dogs' natural prey in the feral state; but these half-wild
dogs threatened and chased other creatures even though most if not all of
them were fed by humans at least once a day.
My attitude towards free-roaming dogs differs from that of Mr. Clifton in
his interesting post; I've seen them in various countries around the world,
and while much of what Mr. Clifton says is true, I question whether the dogs
in developing countries are truly "better behaved." Free-roaming,
unvaccinated dogs in any nation are a major health problem, as well as a
public safety problem, in my opinion; of the diseases they can spread to the
human population, rabies may be the most feared but it is hardly the only
disease dogs can carry to humans, particularly since feral dogs tend to find
the same food sources as rats, and can carry the diseases of rats to human
hosts. Furthermore, in the developing world, any infectious disease is far
more dangerous to the human and food animal population than the same disease
would be here.
The human suffering from dog bites, even those that are not complicated
by subsequent disease, is bad enough in itself to warrant extirpating the
feral dog population in developing nations, in my opinion. Canines are
remarkably tenacious in the game of survival. It takes concerted effort just
to keep feral populations down; eliminating them is nearly impossible.

[These contributions provide a convenient point to cut this thread. This
discussion despite its intrinsic interest is in danger of drifting away
from the immediate problem (economic and administrative?) of inadequate
provision of potent human anti-rabies vaccine in Pakistan. - Mod.CP
