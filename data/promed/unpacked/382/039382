DRC: Cholera outbreaks hit several areas The epidemiological situation has
significantly deteriorated throughout the DRC, particularly in the eastern
provinces, the Humanitarian Coordinator's report said. Outbreaks of cholera
were reported in the Walungu, Lemera, Uvira and Katana areas of South Kivu,
in parts of North Kivu and Province Orientale, and in Kinshasa. Mortality
rates had reached almost 12 percent but, as a result of the timely
interventions of relief agencies in cholera-affected areas, the rates had
gone down significantly, it said. A meningitis epidemic in Lubumbashi in
mid-October was contained with the support of MSF and WHO, the report
added. This item is delivered by the UN's IRIN humanitarian information

The Blantyre city assembly (council) has confirmed the first case of
cholera in the city, heralding a fresh outbreak of the disease in the
current rain season. The assembly's public relations officer, Lunzana
Kamwana, told journalists Thursday that one person was diagnosed with the
water-borne disease in the high- density Zingwangwa township in the city.
"We are very alert to prevent the disease from spreading," he said. Kamwana
said the assembly has formed an anti-cholera committee comprising civic
leaders, health officials and politician to devise ways of containing the
spread of the disease which in 1998 killed at least 5000 people in the
country. She said that unused pit latrines in the township where the
disease has been identified are being destroyed while anti- cholera
chemicals are being applied to water sources. Cholera becomes a major
problem during rains in urban areas of Malawi, especially in crowded
locations, whose low-income residents use untreated water while large
families share pit latrines.

Lagos - No fewer that 37 people were feared dead in Birnin-Kudu and Roni
local government areas of Jigawa State, following the outbreak of cholera
epidemic in the villages, killing an average of six daily in the congested
hospital where the victims are currently being rushed to. The rate at
which the epidemic has spread to all parts of the local government areas
has reached an alarming proportion as more people continue to die in the
villages due to bad roads and lack of transportation to bring patients to
the hospital. Alhaji Nasiru Umar, chairman, Roni Local Government Council,
confirmed this and said that the state government has responded and sent
drugs and medications worth N70 000 to the areas. Publication Date: 28 Oct

Cholera, Rwanda. On 25 October, an outbreak was notified by the Chief
Medical Officer of the Ruhengeri health region, where the main hospital had
admitted suspect cholera cases. Two samples were confirmed by laboratory
as _Vibrio cholerae_ serotype Inaba. On 26 October, a team from the
Ministry of Health visited the area to further investigate and evaluate the
situation: the first case was recorded on 14 October; from 14 to 31
October, a total of 140 cases and 5 deaths were reported in Ruhengeri
health region; the communes of Cyabingo, Kigombe and Nyakinama were
affected; most cases used water from the river Kigombe for domestic
purposes and drinking. It was noted that the latrines in the affected
communities were built along the river bank and a likely source of
contamination. In response to the outbreak the health authorities:
established a surveillance system (daily notification) in all affected
communes to detect new cases; provided oral rehydration salts, intravenous
fluids and antibiotics to local health officers for treating cases;
disseminated education messages on hygiene through the local health
officers; distributed chlorine tablets to the population for treating water.

The cholera is spreading from Bossaso to Garoweh in Somalia's northeastern
region known as Puntland. In Garoweh town, more than 15 cholera cases were
reported Friday alone with one fatality. According to the local health
authorities in Bossaso, more than 25 people fall for the disease everyday
in the northeastern town alone. Abdullahi Saeed of the Bossaso hospital
told reporters Friday that the rampant disease affects mainly children,
women and elderly people. Four people have died for the disease inside the
quarantine ward, while eight more died without any treatment in the
residential quarters of the town Thursday alone, according to the hospital
sources. Local doctors attributed the quick spread of Cholera to the rainy
season, which is affecting Puntland and Somaliland. Another element
facilitating the easy spread of the disease is the movement of people from
a town to another carrying the cholera germ along with them. The task force
representing local authorities in collaboration with United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) is
chlorinating the shallow water wells. Local doctors have been informing the
people not to eat any uncovered food, which they said could be contaminated
by the cholera germ. Nearly 1000 people have so far been affected by the
disease since mid- August this year, with fatalities exceeding 60.

Following reports of an outbreak of acute diarrhoeal syndrome in Chibombo
District, North Central Province, a team from the Ministry of Health
visited the district on 13 October 1999 to assess the situation. The
outbreak had been laboratory confirmed as cholera on 7 October. The first
case identified at the end of September was a person who had travelled to
one of the many fishing camps in the area which are located along the
Lukanga swamps. The person had become ill while returning to his home
village. Further cases were identified who had also travelled to the swamp
area. A rapid response team was activated and requests for assistance and
supplies were made. A health education campaign was also initiated in the
areas affected. At the time of the visit there had been 9 cases including 3
deaths at health centres and another 3 cases, all fatal, in the community.

The Department of Health (DH) reminded members of the public to be on guard
against cholera following the confirmation of a local cholera case today
(Thursday). The patient is a 50-year-old woman living in Sha Tin. She had
not travelled outside Hong Kong during the incubation period. DH is
conducting further tests to see if the present case is linked with a local
cholera case confirmed last Saturday (October 23) when the patient's
brother, a 35-year-old man, was suspected to have contracted the disease
through the consumption of left-over food cross contaminated by raw seafood
at home. The patient of the present case is now receiving treatment in
Princess Margaret Hospital and is in stable condition. A spokesman for DH
said: "The two cases indicate the importance of food and personal hygiene
in the prevention of cholera and other food-borne diseases." Members of
the public are advised to take, among others, the following precautionary
measures: Wash hands with soap after visiting toilet and before preparing
or eating food; Leftover food should be reheated thoroughly before
consumption; and Avoid cross-contamination of raw and cooked food and
properly store all perishable food not meant for immediate consumption.
To-date, 18 confirmed cholera cases were reported in Hong Kong this (1999)
year. Of these, nine were imported cases and nine were local cases.

The Ministry of Health of Fiji has submitted the following information to
WHO. On 30 July 1999, the Ministry of Health of New Zealand reported an
imported case of cholera to WHO and to the Ministry of Health of Fiji.
_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor subtype Ogawa had been confirmed in a
26-year-old male from New Zealand who had visited a small offshore reef
island in Fiji as a tourist in June 1999. He had experienced onset of
symptoms on the fourth day of his visit. A similar case in a visitor from
New Zealand, possibly acquired at the same Fiji island resort, was
investigated by the Ministry of Health of Fiji 8 months earlier. No other
cases were found at that time. After the second report, the Ministry of
Health of Fiji launched a thorough investigation, in collaboration with
WHO. No further cholera cases have been detected, but the investigators did
find evidence of faecal contamination of the island's fresh water source
(i.e. the groundwater lens) and of the salt water intake for a desalination
facility purchased by the resort a few years earlier. Water samples from
boreholes that draw from the groundwater lens have revealed the presence of
_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, _V. mimicus_ O36, and _V. cholerae_ O19. _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1 has not been found in the water samples taken. The island's
drinking-water is separately obtained from a rainwater catchment system,
supplemented by barged water from outside the island, and supplied to guest
rooms in plastic jugs. All water sources (borehole, desalinator, rain
catchment, and barged water) are chlorinated before distribution. Although
the borehole and desalinated water is not intended for drinking,
investigators considered it likely that the infections had occurred either
by consumption of foods contaminated in the kitchen with inadequately
treated borehole water, or by inadvertent consumption of the water itself
when free residual chlorine was absent. Revised chlorination procedures
are currently in place to provide added protection in the short term for
residents and visitors. Other measures have already been taken to provide
a long-term solution on the affected island. There is no evidence to
suggest that a problem exists in Fiji beyond this small resort island, and
Fiji's water supply is generally considered safe. Note: The public health
response in this case illustrates the usefulness of quick and effective
communication between countries. There is no risk for travellers to this
area in view of the long term measures put into place to solve the problem
on this small offshore island.

Forty-four schoolchildren from a boarding school in Khabarovsk have been
diagnosed with dysentery and hospitalized, Chief of the Khabarovsk Sanitary
Surveillance Inspectorate Yuri Garbuz told Itar Tass on Wednesday that
forty other children who developed alarming symptoms have been isolated
from other children of the boarding house and are kept under medical
observation. "Measures which have been taken helped bar the spread of the
infection," Garbuz said. He believes that a mass epidemic of dysentery has
been caused by serious violation of sanitary and anti-epidemic regulations
by the school personnel and attempts to treat the sick children by home
remedies."
