Indonesia says 17 in Sulawesi not infected with bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu has been ruled out as the cause of illness in 17 people from
the same neighbourhood of Makassar in Sulawesi, Indonesia, a health
ministry official said on Thursday [20 Nov 2008]. The 17 were
hospitalised this month after falling sick shortly after a rash of
unexplained chicken deaths in the area. "The result of the tests is
negative," said Lily Sulistyowati, spokeswoman of the Ministry,
without giving details. Suspected outbreaks raise concerns about rare
human-to-human transmission or that the virus might have mutated into
a form that can pass easily among people.

The country's largest known cluster of bird flu cases in humans
occurred in May 2006 in the Karo district of North Sumatra province,
when as many as 7 people in an extended family died. The World Health
Organisation (WHO) said at the time that limited human-to-human
transmission could not be ruled out but that the virus samples from
the scene did not show any significant genetic mutations.

Bird flu remains mainly an animal disease, but experts fear the H5N1
virus might mutate into a pandemic strain that would sweep the globe,
possibly killing millions and hobbling economies. Indonesia has the
highest toll of any nation. Some 112 people have died because of the disease.

Last week [week of 10 Nov 2008], a health official said a 15-year-old
Indonesian girl had died of bird flu in central Java, but Chandra
Yoga Adhitama, acting director-general of communicable disease
control, said tests showed bird flu was not responsible.

[Both the single suspected human case of avian (H5N1) influenza in
central Java, and now the suspected cluster of 17 cases in Sulawesi,
described in the ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza, human
(73): Indonesia, conf., cluster susp. 20081113.3573", are no longer
considered by the Indonesian Ministry of Health to be confirmed
cases. Thus the number of confirmed human cases of avian influenza in
Indonesia remains 137, of whom 112 have died.
