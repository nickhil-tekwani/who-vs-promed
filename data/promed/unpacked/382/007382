A scientist for Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton [RML, Montana, USA] is calling on his scientific colleagues worldwide, including the US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention and the World Health Organization, to stop the long-distance shipment of diseased tissue and blood samples for testing and to start communicating the results immediately.

"Each continent should have its own testing lab, in fact, to reduce the need for long-distance shipments and to reduce the turnaround time on testing," said Dr Heinz Feldmann. "In an outbreak, it is essential for scientists to share their data real-time in the interest of public health."

Feldmann's recommendations were published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, in the article "Ebola -- A Surprise in West Africa?"

Under existing procedures, a tissue or blood sample from a suspected patient is collected on site, packaged, and shipped to a testing laboratory, often in another country, where the diagnosis is made. There is often a significant time delay in both shipping and communicating the results back to the doctor working with the patient.

There is currently an ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak in Africa, mainly in Guinea and Liberia; Mali borders Guinea, so Mali is on watch. After a few suspected cases were reported there, Malian officials invited the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to send scientists to help evaluate their isolation procedures and to test and handle patient samples.

Rocky Mountain Lab scientists Heinz Feldmann, MD, PhD, chief of NIAID's Laboratory of Virology, and Dave Safronetz, PhD, left Hamilton for Mali, Africa on 8 Apr 2014. Feldmann is an expert on ebolaviruses. He has worked on previous outbreaks in Africa and had traveled to Mali, but never for an Ebola outbreak. Safronetz does not work with Ebola, but does work with similar viruses in that region. He has expertise in organizing field research sampling. He travels to Mali frequently and has established contacts with people there. "We offered our help because we work there, we thought we could help them in this circumstance and this threatening situation to their not-so-well-functioning public health situation compared to ours," said Feldmann. "They do a pretty good job for what they have."

The Integrated Research Facility at RML was designed to assist with global emerging infectious disease outbreaks. They have assisted in 2009 (H1N1 influenza), in 2012 (ongoing MERS outbreak in the Middle East), and now with EVD in West Africa. Feldmann said the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization would normally supply the expertise that was needed in Mali, but with events in Liberia their office was "stretched thin and they didn't have the manpower. They were happy we were going to help out." Feldmann and Safronetz were asked to set up a laboratory and train nationals to do the necessary testing. "Our job was to find the right place for the diagnostics, a safe place for the diagnostics, and train the people to do the job because it is not really going to help them if you do it for them and then leave," said Feldmann.

Setting up a laboratory was difficult, in that politics was very much involved in the process. Everyone wanted the fame of being the center for testing Ebola, but no one wanted to take the blame if things went wrong. Everyone worried about costs. Eventually they reached an agreement. The RML scientists brought all the diagnostic equipment with them that would be needed to test the samples and they selected the national scientists for training. "We chose these people to be trained," Feldmann said. "They were very well trained, very well educated, very bright, very smart. We felt comfortable."

Safronetz and Feldmann did not treat patients directly, stating that it is better for local physicians to take care of the patients -- not just because the patients speak French and neither of them does, but also so the rumor doesn't get circulated about white people bringing in Ebola. The testing of the cases began. "We tested all the suspect cases with them, and fortunately found them all to be negative," said Feldmann. "We tested for other pathogens, and they were negative as well." They still do not know what was making the people ill [with EVD-like symptoms]. But for Feldmann and Safronetz, the experience with the event taught them that changes need to be made.

Rather than shipping blood and tissue samples for testing, each continent should have its own testing lab, they said. And in an outbreak, it is essential for scientists to share their data real-time with colleagues, in the interest of public health. "For example in Mali, they originally sent the sample to CDC [USA] and it took almost 14 days to get to CDC," said Feldmann. "It's not the CDC [being late] in their response, they do it immediately, but they just don't get the samples. The samples get stuck at the airport, then at the next airport. ... There is response needed in a country and you are waiting for results. Results are blocked by bureaucracy or regulation and this is why this is not working. "If you don't have diagnostics in the field, it takes too long for the response efforts. As soon as sequences become known, they need to be made available to the people that provide diagnostic support at the very minimum."

Feldmann and Safronetz returned to Hamilton [Montana] on [19 Apr 2014] -- leaving the diagnostic equipment in Mali. "We brought over all the sophisticated diagnostic machinery that's required and we left that all in place for the Malians to continue to work, should there be more suspected cases popping up in country," said Safronetz. "The trained individuals are still ready. We still talk with them every little while to see if there is anything wrong or if they are experiencing problems or if any questions have come up. So far, they've had no issues at all.

"We worked with the Malian public health officials. We look forward to working with them in the future." Feldmann said he believes we are set up relatively well if a worldwide outbreak were to occur. "Whatever happens in our health care system is sufficient. If you go to a physician, they put gloves on and most likely that is already enough for preventing human to human transmission," he said. "By what we have established here we'll do quite well. It's not that the Africans don't want to put gloves on -- they just don't have anything to put on."

Making an impact on lives is an amazing opportunity that they didn't believe they would ever get to experience in their lifetime. The majority of work at RML is the basic science, and this trip allowed scientists to work with people and interact with people and see the final results on how their work affects lives.

[It is good to see another neighbouring country besides Senegal taking preparedness seriously. There is now a functioning ebolavirus diagnostic lab in Mali. Mali's capital, Bamako, is 900 km (560 mi) by road from Guinea's capital, Conakry, and 1160 km (720 mi) from Sierra Leone's capital, so if air transport is problematic, and if Mali would agree, perhaps sending specimens by bus would be practical.

But as far as each continent having its own testing lab, the Americans must have been misquoted, because flights within Africa can be subject to similar delays to those of flights out of Africa, and the same would apply to Asia. Regional labs would make sense -- West Africa already has 2: one in Dakar, Senegal and another in Franceville, Gabon -- and South Africa has one also, but how will labs for East and Central Africa be funded long term? The reagents will initially have to come from the USA and be paid for in US dollars, and because "Africans ... just don't have anything (gloves) to put on" -- due to inadequate health budgets -- the labs will need an outside source of protective equipment. - Mod.JW
