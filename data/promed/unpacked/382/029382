The number of salmonella cases continues to climb, despite the pull of a product linked to the bacterial outbreak.

The Buncombe County Health Department announced today three more cases of salmonella Paratyhpi B infection, up from 34 Monday.

As first reported by the Citizen-Times on Monday, a locally made fermented bean product had tested positive for the bacteria. Makers of Smiling Hara Tempeh have voluntarily called for the product to be taken from shelves of over 30 stores and restaurants.

The bacteria can cause diarrhea that may be bloody, high fever, headache and abdominal pain. It can be more dangerous to infants, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems.

Tests by the N.C. Department of Agriculture confirmed the bacteria was present in a sample collected from a routine inspection by the Food and Drug Protection Division, according to a statement from Smiling Hara Tempeh. Further testing is being done, it added.

Chad Oliphant, who is charge of sales for Smiling Hara Tempeh, said salmonella was found in one batch and that they were waiting for more definitive lab results, including the exact bacteria species.

"On everything else, it is all preliminary," Oliphant said. "We don't have any other results other than that. We are just withdrawing all of our products until we hear anything else."

Smiling Hara Tempeh says consumers should not eat the product, which was made between Jan. 11 and April 11. It is in 12-ounce containers and has a best by date of July 11 through Oct. 25. Products can be returned to the place of purchase for a full refund, the statement said.

The tempeh is sold to more than 30 local stores and restaurants, including Earth Fare supermarket and the Laughing Seed restaurant downtown, the website says.

The company voluntarily pulled the product from stores and restaurants, county and state health officials said.

No other commercial food makers are being looked at in connection with the county outbreak, including those that share a commercial kitchen with the company, said Brian Long, spokesman for the agriculture department, which regulates food production, on Monday.

As of 1 May 2012, Buncombe County Department of Health reports 37 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B infection and continues to test and investigate people coming forward with symptoms of salmonella infection, some who ate tempeh and others who did not eat tempeh. The case interviews indicate that the disease transmission is linked to the outbreak in one of 3 ways: those who have eaten tempeh, those who have connections to others who have been ill with _S._ Paratyphi B (person-to-person), and others that are under further investigation to determine if there are other sources of contamination associated with the outbreak.

Confirmatory lab results are expected later this week that should confirm whether the tempeh is a match to the type of _Salmonella_ associated with the current outbreak. At this time we cannot assure people that if they stay away from the tempeh that they won't get sick. Health officials appreciate the precautionary measures taken by Smiling Hara, who recalled their tempeh product while awaiting confirmation that the tempeh is directly linked to this outbreak.

Tempeh (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempeh) is a traditional soy product originally from Indonesia. It is made by a natural culturing and controlled fermentation process that binds soybeans into a cake form, similar to a very firm vegetarian burger patty. Tempeh is unique among major traditional soy foods in that it is the only one that did not originate in the Sinosphere.

It originated in today's Indonesia, and is especially popular on the island of Java, where it is a staple source of protein. Like tofu, tempeh is made from soybeans, but tempeh is a whole soybean product with different nutritional characteristics and textural qualities. Tempeh's fermentation process and its retention of the whole bean give it a higher content of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins. It has a firm texture and an earthy flavor, which becomes more pronounced as the tempeh ages. Because of its nutritional value, tempeh is used worldwide in vegetarian cuisine; some consider it to be a meat analogue. - Mod.LL]
