[Circulating strains of FMD virus change, and the danger posed by a new strain must be taken into consideration when developing a vaccination strategy to combat outbreaks such as this one or in nearby Egypt. See Mod.AS's comments in Foot & mouth disease - Egypt (05): st SAT2, OIE 20120314.1070386 for an update on the importance of incorporating SAT2 in the vaccination strategy for the present outbreak.

Libya reported 2 outbreaks of FMD serotype O in Tarabulus in December 2010. Additionally, there were 2 outbreaks of serotype A in February 2009 in Az Zawiyah and Misrath and one outbreak in Banghazi in January 2009. A previous outbreak of FMD disease occurred in 2003, and it was SAT2 serotype.

With the advent of SAT2 in the current outbreak, the dominant serotype in Egypt has changed 3 times since 2006. Egypt reported no FMD outbreaks in 2011 or 2010 but one outbreak of serotype A and 7 outbreaks of serotype O in 2009, one of serotype O in 2007, and 31 outbreaks of serotype A in 2006.

Neither Algeria or Tunisia have reported FMD to the OIE WAHID database since 2005.

The current outbreak is in Banghazi, not anywhere nearby the Egyptian outbreaks; see map appended to the OIE WAHID report and at the HealthMap link http://healthmap.org/r/1_fL, where, for comparison, the location of the Egyptian outbreaks may also be found. - Mod.PC]
