A virus previously thought to be linked to a baffling condition known
as chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is not the cause of the disease,
scientists said on Monday [20 Dec 2010] after their study found
previous research was contaminated in the lab.

Researchers from University College London, the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute and Oxford University said cell samples from patients in
earlier studies were contaminated with the virus, known as XMRV
[xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus], which is found in
the DNA of mice. This suggests the patients were not infected with
XMRV and it could not have triggered their illness, the scientists said.

The research, published in the journal Retrovirology [see comment], is
the latest to contradict a U.S. study from 2009 which suggested a link
between XMRV and CFS, when the virus was found in the blood of 68 out
of 101 CFS patients. The XMRV virus has also been identified in
samples from certain prostate cancer patients.

"Our conclusion is quite simple: XMRV is not the cause of chronic
fatigue syndrome," said Greg Towers, of UCL, who worked on the latest
study. "All our evidence shows that the sequences from the virus
genome in cell culture have contaminated human chronic fatigue
syndrome and prostate cancer samples."

CFS is a debilitating condition of disabling physical and mental
fatigue that does not improve with rest. It is also known as myalgic
encephalomyelitis (ME) and affects around 17 million people worldwide.
There is no cure for CSF, and scientists don't know what causes it,
but many sufferers say they think their illness started after a viral
infection.

Towers said it was vital to understand that this latest research did
not suggest chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is not caused by a virus of
some sort. "We cannot answer that yet," he said. "But we know it is
not this virus causing it."

The 2009 U.S. study that found a link had prompted hopes that CFS
patients might benefit from a range of drugs designed to fight AIDS,
cancer and inflammation. But in January 2010, British researchers
found no evidence of XMRV [xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related
virus] in 186 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, and 2 separate
studies published in February [2010] also failed to identify the virus
in groups of ME patients.

Towers' team said their study found that the XMRV found in the studies
that linked it to CFS was from contamination by a laboratory cell line
or mouse DNA. The sequences from the contaminated cell line and
chronic fatigue patient samples were very similar, they said, and this
is contrary to what scientists would expect from a virus if it were
spreading in humans.

Tim Peto, a consultant in infectious diseases at Oxford University who
was not involved in the research, said Monday's [20 Dec 2010] findings
meant "it now seems really very, very unlikely that XMRV is linked to
chronic fatigue syndrome."

"It came as a great surprise when XMRV was 1st suggested as being
linked to chronic fatigue syndrome," he said in an e-mailed statement.
"There have now been a number of attempts which have failed to find
the retrovirus in other samples, and this research suggests that in
fact XMRV is probably a contamination from mouse DNA."

[XMRV is a virus found in mouse DNA. It was discovered in 2006, and
was later found in samples from some patients with prostate cancer and
chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome is thought to
affect some 250 000 people in the UK. Symptoms include extreme
tiredness, problems with memory and concentration, sleep disturbances
and mood swings. There is currently no accepted cure and no
universally effective treatment. A paper providing some evidence in
support of a link between chronic fatigue syndrome and the virus was
published in the leading journal Science last year [2009]. The latest
work of the team from London and the University of Oxford using DNA
sequencing methods to study XMRV does not confirm that research.

Abstract: "We demonstrate that Taqman PCR primers previously described
as XMRV-specific can amplify common murine endogenous viral sequences
from mouse suggesting that mouse DNA can contaminate patient samples
and confound specific XMRV detection. To consider the provenance of
XMRV we sequenced XMRV from the cell line 22Rv1, which is infected
with an MLV-X that is indistinguishable from patient derived XMRV.
Bayesian phylogenies clearly show that XMRV sequences reportedly
derived from unlinked patients form a monophyletic clade with
interspersed 22Rv1 clones (posterior probability over 0.99). The cell
line- derived sequences are ancestral to the patient-derived sequences
(posterior probability over 0.99). Furthermore, pol sequences
apparently amplified from PC patient material (VP29 and VP184) are
recombinants of XMRV and Moloney MLV (MoMLV) a virus with an envelope
that lacks tropism for human cells. Considering the diversity of XMRV,
we show that the mean pairwise genetic distance among env and pol
22Rv1-derived sequences exceeds that of patient-associated sequences
(Wilcoxon rank sum test: p=0.005 and p less than 0.001 for pol and
env, respectively). Thus, XMRV sequences acquire diversity in a cell
line but not in patient samples. These observations are difficult to
reconcile with the hypothesis that published XMRV sequences are
related by a process of infectious transmission."

This paper is accompanied by 3 other supporting papers and the
following commentary by Robert A. Smith: "Efforts to assess the
prevalence of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) in
patients with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome have relied
heavily on PCR-based testing of clinical samples and have yielded
widely divergent findings. This week in Retrovirology, reports from 4
independent research groups illustrate the extreme care needed to
exclude DNA or RNA contamination in PCR analyses of XMRV. In addition,
phylogenetic evidence suggesting that previously-published XMRV
sequences originated from a commonly-used prostate carcinoma cell line
(22Rv1) is presented. These findings raise important questions
regarding the provenance of XMRV and its potential connection to human
disease."

No doubt, this controversy will continue, but the negative evidence of
an association is beginning to outweigh the evidence for a positive
association. - Mod.CP]
