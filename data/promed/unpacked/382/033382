[The CDC web-site <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hanta/hps/index.htm>
identifies hantaviruses in the New World as follows. North America:
Hantaviruses in the New World are associated with hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS). Sigmodontine rodents carry the hantaviruses that cause HPS
and are found throughout the Americas. Sin Nombre virus, carried by
_Peromyscus maniculatus_, is the predominant cause of HPS in the United
States and Canada. Mononghela, New York, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal
viruses also cause HPS and are found in eastern Canada and eastern and
southeastern United States. In South and Central America, hantaviruses
that have been identified as causing HPS are Andes virus in Argentina and
Chile; Andes-like viruses including Oran, Lechiguanas, and Hu39694 in
Argentina; Laguna Negra virus in Bolivia and Paraguay; Bermejo virus in
Argentina; Juquitiba virus in Brazil; and Choclo virus in Panama. Numerous
other hantaviruses have been identified but have not been !
linked to human disease. - Mod.CP]

Saskatchewan: Indian Reserve Concerned About Hantavirus
-------------------------------------------------------
A northern 1st Nation is taking precautions after a deadly case of
hantavirus infection. A woman from Pelican Narrows fell ill last month
[April 2005] and died from the disease, which is spread by deer mice. A
preliminary investigation suggests she contracted hantavirus in a home in
Pelican Narrows. Now, people living there are being urged to take steps to
prevent it from happening again. Health officials are also urging calm,
saying the disease is rare. "This is not a reason to panic," said Mandiangu
Nsungu, the region's medical health officer. "The proportion of mice that
are able to transmit hantavirus is very small."

Meanwhile, Chief Ron Michel of Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation is asking
people in the region to take steps to prevent the spread of hantavirus.
"I've been telling my people...to try and clean up their yards where these
rodents populate," he said. Michel has also ordered inspections for all
public buildings operated by the 1st Nation. One school with a history of
mouse problems has been temporarily shut down at Deschambault Lake.

The Pelican Narrows case is the province's 16th case of hantavirus in 10
years. It's also the 5th fatality from the disease.

[ProMED-mail regrets the delay in posting this information on this
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case in Saskatchewan, which occurred prior to
the death of the Albertan women in April 2005, posted as "Hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome, fatal - Canada (AB) 20050514.1322". Consequently the
death of the Albertan woman was not the 1st hantavirus pulmonary syndrome
death in Canada since 2002 as stated in that post, but the 3rd (there being
a prior death in Saskatchewan in April 2003); see

Rodent Population Dynamics, Raptors, Climate and Virus Interactions
---------------------------------------------------
The case of hantavirus infection in Colorado led me to post some thoughts I
had about the interaction between hantaviruses, West Nile virus (WNV), and
climate.

It is well known that WNV has had a negative impact on raptor populations.
What seems less understood is whether this impact has much influence on
rodent populations. My premise is that because the raptors in part help
control rodent populations, a rodent bloom could appear when raptor
populations are diminished.

The other piece that seems to play a role in this is climate. WNV activity
seems to be lower in dry years. This seems to have been the case in 2004.
However, wetter climates probably increase both WNV activity as well as the
potential for hantavirus activity. Clearly mosquito activity is much higher
in a moist season. The outbreak of hantavirus infection in the 4 Corners
regions has been linked to a moist season as well, which allow rodent
populations to bloom after the moisture increased the food supply.

The questions that remains to be answered is whether hantavirus activity
will increase beyond what is expected due to the combination of wet climate
and smaller raptor populations. This may also hold true for other diseases
with life cycles including rodents in areas with raptor populations heavily
affected by WNV.

Wet Weather Could Increase Hantavirus Risk
------------------------------------------
Spring rains could mean a greater danger of hantavirus this year. The
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported the state's
1st case of the acute respiratory disease in early April. A La Plata County
man was hospitalized in mid-March 2005 with an illness later confirmed as
hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome].

"This early-season case serves as a reminder for people to take simple
precautions to avoid exposure to hantavirus when opening cabins and doing
spring cleaning," said John Pape, an epidemiologist with the health
department. "It is expected that mouse populations may be high this year
due to the increased moisture in many areas of the state." Recent moisture
has caused a lush growth of plants. "More food equals more mice," Pape
said. In fact, this year could see a population boom in deer mice.

Hantavirus is carried by deer mice, which are found throughout Colorado and
most commonly in rural areas. Mice release the virus in their urine and
feces. Humans contract the disease not by direct contact with deer mice but
by breathing in the dust stirred up in sheds, trailers, cabins, or any
place infested with mice. Although the disease is well-known, a variant was
discovered in the 4 Corners area in 1993 when a Navajo man and his
girlfriend died of respiratory failure within one week of each other.

The last case reported in this area was in 1998 when a Wolcott man was
diagnosed with hantavirus infection. In 1994 a Glenwood Springs man died of
the disease after cleaning under a trailer, said county public health nurse
Mary Meisner. In 2004, there were 4 cases in Colorado, including one death.

Pape said people should be especially careful if they notice a high number
of mice as evidenced by droppings or nests, mouse damage or live mice. "As
people begin cleaning out barns, garages, storage buildings, trailers or
cabins that have been closed up all winter, they need to take precautions
before beginning such work, particularly if there are signs of mice," Pape
said.

2nd Hantavirus Patient Being Treated in Albuquerque
------------------------------------------------------
The University of New Mexico Hospital was treating its 2nd hantavirus
patient of the month on Friday [29 Apr 2005], but health officials said
they aren't yet sure if a rise in cases of the potentially fatal disease is
imminent this year.

The 32-year-old woman from southern Colorado admitted to the hospital on
Wednesday was in satisfactory condition on Friday, hospital spokeswoman
Cindy Foster said.

A 29-year-old man from northeastern Arizona, admitted earlier this month
with hantavirus, remained in critical condition. The man had been treated
with an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO, machine, but is no
longer on it. The hospital has used ECMO to treat patients with hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome. The machine puts oxygen in the blood and helps pump it
through the body, making up for the infection weakening the lungs and heart.

Experts have warned the wet weather of winter and early spring could mean
higher populations of mice this year in the West. "The increase in moisture
and increase in vegetation can lead to an increase in rodent population,"
said Dr. Bernadette Albanese, a medical epidemiologist with the New Mexico
Department of Health. Albanese said about 10 percent of the deer mice in
New Mexico are infected with hantavirus. "Having more mice around can
increase the likelihood a human will come in contact with mice droppings or
urine, but the question that I can't answer is if having more mice around
will increase the percentage of mice that will be infected," Albanese said.

The conditions this year have been likened by experts to 1993, when the
disease was first identified in the 4 Corners area. The outbreak killed 10
people and led to identification of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Albanese
said hantavirus remains a relatively rare disease, but added, "the risk is
there and it's high enough to be concerned."

Hantavirus is passed to humans when they inhale particles of dried urine or
feces from infected rodents, especially deer mice. The problem most often
occurs when people enter buildings such as cabins or sheds that have been
closed for a while and have been infested by mice. The illness is marked by
fever, headache and muscle ache, possibly with chills, nausea and vomiting,
and progresses rapidly to severe difficulty in breathing and, in some
cases, death. Symptoms develop one to 6 weeks after exposure.

Health officials advise that anyone entering a building that has been
closed up for several months and may be infested by mice wear a face mask
and gloves and use a bleach solution to wet and clean up any mouse nests or
droppings.

New Mexico has recorded a total of 63 cases of hantavirus. 27 of those
cases have been fatal, according to numbers released by the state in
December 2004, when a man contracted hantavirus while searching for
Christmas decorations in a storage shed.

Nebraskan Dies From Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome
-------------------------------------------------
A western Nebraska man in his early 50s died last month [April 2005] after
being infected with hantavirus, a virus which is spread through the urine,
droppings or saliva of infected rodents, state officials said. Humans can
contract the virus by inhaling.

The man who died in late April worked in a rural agricultural setting. He
saw his doctor after becoming ill and was hospitalized the next day in
North Platte, then transferred to the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha,
said Dr. Tom Safranek, state epidemiologist.

The man is the 4th person in Nebraska to die of the disease. 9 cases have
been confirmed since the virus was first reported in the state in 1998,
according to state records. 2 possible cases have not been resolved.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome attacks the lungs, destroying air sacs and
preventing the movement of oxygen into the body, Safranek said. The disease
was virtually unheard of [i.e. unrecognised - Mod.CP] in the United States
until an outbreak occurred in May 1993 in an area where New Mexico,
Arizona, Colorado and Utah meet.
