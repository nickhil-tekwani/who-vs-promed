Origin of the HPAI H7N7 influenza virus
----------------------------------------
The origin is uncertain, but we are told by a Dutch epidemiologist
that one theory is that the outbreaks may have originated in the
southwest of the Netherlands near a lake district called Biesbos. A
surveillance survey found 3 poultry farms which were seropositive for
low pathogenicity AI (avian influenza virus). One of these farms had
free-range poultry and was adjacent to canals with many wild
waterfowl. The farm is reported to have had a hatchery service man
who also served flocks in the Gelderse Valley. It is possible that
the low pathogenicity avian influenza strain mutated to a HPAI strain
after infecting poultry in the Gelderse Valley.
However, according to virologist Prof Dr A. Osterhaus of the Erasmus
University in Rotterdam, his group have previously (1-2 years ago)
found the HPAI H7N7 virus type in migrating ducks and waterfowl. It
seems likely that wild waterfowl are a reservoir of the virus.
Similar virus strains (H7N1, H7N3) have been isolated in Italy over
the past 4 years from poultry farms; in Italy turkey flocks have also
been reservoirs for the virus.

Situation 29 April -- infections and suspicions
----------------------------------------------
The total number of seriously suspected outbreaks of fowl plague
[highly pathogenic avian influenza -- HPAI] is currently 15, of which
5 are in non-commercial ("hobby" management) holdings. Since the
beginning of the epidemic, 243 holdings have been found definitely
infected, of which 19 were diagnosed on non-commercial ("hobby")
holdings. 21.0 million AI-susceptible animals have been culled so far.

Bird flu: Europe on red alert
-----------------------------
Several western European countries are on red alert as an epidemic of
highly contagious bird flu -- which has reportedly killed one person
after crossing the species barrier -- continued to take its toll on
Dutch and Belgian poultry farms.
The Netherlands and Belgium went on slaughtering chickens in a bid to
prevent the spread of the avian influenza, and the Netherlands
ordered an investigation to assess the impact on people of the viral
disease, which is highly contagious to chickens, turkeys, ducks, and
other birds.
Germany and France, which share borders with the Netherlands and
Belgium, were also on guard against a possible spread of the ailment,
which has already caused nearly 20 million chickens to be culled.
Experts say that the current outbreak, caused by a virus known as
H7N7, is not dangerous to people, but that the virus could mutate,
triggering a potentially dangerous influenza epidemic.
The World Health Organization [WHO], which is preparing a test kit
and developing a vaccine for the disease, has advised special
vigilance. "Persons in contact with H7N7-affected poultry flocks
should be on guard for any signs and symptoms of respiratory
disease," it said on Thu, 24 Apr 2003.
WHO has said that a 57-year-old Dutch veterinarian, who died on 17
Apr of chronic pneumonia, may have died of bird flu, after traces of
the virus were found in his lungs. WHO says his death appeared to be
an isolated case.
"No other cause of death could be detected, a clear indication that
the man died as a result of infection from this virus," said a Dutch
statement. A further 83 people in the Netherlands have been diagnosed
with mild conjunctivitis and flu-like symptoms that have been traced
to H7N7, but their cases were not serious, it said.
The Dutch health ministry said it would examine some 5000 people who
have been in contact with infected birds, some of whom would have to
take blood tests. Over 18.5 million chickens [For updated figures,
see 2 above] from a population of 100 million have been culled in the
Netherlands, where an outbreak of the disease started in late
February 2003. Belgium has slaughtered more than 700 000 in just
over one week.
Both countries have created buffer zones, and Brussels has slapped
even stricter controls on a contaminated area north of the port city
of Antwerp. The European Commission has extended bans on the export
of live poultry, eggs, or fresh bird meat from the Netherlands and
Belgium, until 12 May and 10 May, respectively.
Germany, where 100 million chickens are raised, and which shares
borders with both the Netherlands and Belgium, has warned farmers to
be extremely cautious and request certificates of origin whenever
they buy chickens.

EU vets to debate vaccination in bird flu fight
------------------------------------------------
Dutch veterinarians will consult fellow European Union experts next
week about using vaccination as a way to stop the spread of the
highly contagious bird flu virus, EU officials said on Tue, 29 Apr
2003.
At a meeting slated for 6 and 7 May 2003, EU vets from the bloc's 15
member states will hold a debate on aspects of possible vaccination
against bird flu -- a move so far ruled out by the Netherlands due to
the sheer numbers of birds involved.
The debate will focus on eggs produced for consumption, according to
the meeting's draft agenda published on Tuesday. Apart from being the
world's top egg exporter, the Netherlands is also the EU's biggest
poultry exporter.
More than 18 million out of the country's more than 100 million birds
have now been slaughtered, as authorities battle to suppress the
spreading outbreak of bird flu.
"The Netherlands asked us to put it on the agenda, to have a
discussion about it. It's not a formal request to vaccinate ...but
they are considering the possibility," said an official at the
European Commission.
"They are not planning to vaccinate, they just want to have a
discussion with the member states (about) what the consequences of
possible vaccination would be," he said. "And there are voices in the
Netherlands asking for this."
Last month, Dutch health authorities launched a vaccination programme
for farm workers after several suffered from a minor form of bird
flu. The eye infections caused by the virus were relatively harmless
and easily treated.
Dutch authorities ratcheted up their fight against the virus last
week, announcing they would slaughter 6 million more birds and set up
a new buffer zone in the poultry sector's southern heartland. Belgium
has already reported 8 cases.
But the practical difficulties in vaccinating millions of birds would
be immense, not to mention the impact on exports from the key poultry
and egg sector, which has racked up losses in excess of 100 million
euros due to the bird flu outbreak.
The Netherlands exports some 80 percent of its egg production, which
in turn is more than 60 percent of EU exports. Its main export
markets are Hong Kong and also Gulf states such as Oman and the
United Arab Emirates.
"If you have to vaccinate 50 million animals, it's practically not
possible," the official said. "The disease is spreading very quickly
and if you vaccinate, the incubation period is 2 weeks. For bigger
birds, they might need a second vaccination."

[Following the decision of the Dutch authorities to permit the
vaccination of susceptible animals in zoos, a debate on possible
vaccination of other animals seems inevitable. The Belgian daily Het
Nieuwsblad of 29 Apr 2003 presents the story of the Vermeiren family
from Loenhout, who had to cull their entire stock of ostriches -- 144
birds -- because of their proximity to an infected chicken farm. Such
birds, as well as "hobby" birds holdings, might be the next to demand
vaccination.
The vaccines, officially allowed in the decree of 22 Apr 2003 by the
Dutch Ministry of Agriculture for restricted use in zoos, are Nobilis
Influenza H7 manufactured by Intervet (Boxmeer) and Fluvac H7,
manufactured by Merial B.V. (Amstelveen). Both include a
heterologous neuraminidase (not N7), which enables their use as
natural "marker" vaccines or DIVA (differentiating infected from
vaccinated animals). - Mod.AS]
