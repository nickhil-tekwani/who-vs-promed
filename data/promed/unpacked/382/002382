Argentina declares health emergency, flu found in pigs
------------------------------------------------------
The government declared a nationwide animal health emergency following
the discovery of the new H1N1 flu virus in at least one pig herd. The
flu strain has killed 137 people in the South American country during
the Southern Hemisphere winter and the government has closed schools
and urged Argentines to avoid crowded places to halt its spread.

"The contingency plan ... allows for an increase in testing in pig
farms and in slaughter houses in order to guarantee early detection,"
the government's Official Gazette said.

The emergency measure, which will also give officials extra funding to
deal with the outbreak, was drawn up by the state-run SENASA agency,
responsible for animal health and food safety.

Earlier this month, SENASA officials said workers at a pig farm in
Buenos Aires province were suspected of having passed the new strain
onto the animals. That added weight to the theory that pigs can be
infected by humans. Another pig herd later tested positive for the
virus although Friday's statement only made mention of the 1st case.

[This article indicates the H1N1 flu virus has been found a pig herd.
It also indicated surveillance of swine has been increased. Workers
are suspected of having the flu. It does not tell us what epidemiology
work is being done. It does not tell us they are confirming the flu in
the people. It alludes to that issue with the presumptive statement
that humans can infect pigs. Yet there is currently no evidence from
this article that it is the H1N1 affecting the pigs, or that was
carried to them by their handlers or other people on the premises.

This virus in swine was reported to the OIE 1 Jul 2009 but is only
now, 16 days later, making the news and being declared an emergency.
It seems that emergencies are cautious declarations. - Mod.TG
