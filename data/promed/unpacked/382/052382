Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 32 newly confirmed cases in China, 4 of which were imported and 28 acquired locally (25 in Beijing municipality, 2 in Hebei province, and 1 in Liaoning province). While there is no mention of association with the outbreak in Beijing, both Hebei and Liaoning provinces have had locally acquired cases previously associated with the outbreak ongoing in Beijing. No new deaths were reported. 4 new cases were reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1864 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 8 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 2 were imported. There were 2 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time and 2 cases were reported on 14 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 49 cases with no new deaths, compared with 59 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (17 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 71 consecutive days. Today's (18 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 32 cases were locally transmitted, and 17 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (17), Gyeonggi (9), and Daejeon (6). Imported cases were in airport quarantine (11), 3 in Jeju, 2 in Gyeonggi and 1 in Seoul. Note that 13 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. That being said, it appears as though the proportion of locally acquired cases is decreasing on a daily basis and outside of Seoul, Gyeonggi and Daejeon, the remaining provinces have impacted on the local transmission.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 238 159 cases, including 34 514 deaths, up by 333 cases and 43 deaths in the past 24 hours [note that our calculations show an increase of 331 cases since 17 Jun 2020]. The previous day's (17 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 329 cases and 43 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 216 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4908_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4908_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (216) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (4 provinces reported no new cases), with only 2 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Emilia-Romagna 32 cases and Piedmont 31 cases).

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 45 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 29 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 197 647 total cases, 9272 deaths
Date: Thu 18 2020

Iran is approaching 10 000 deaths from the coronavirus outbreak, its Ministry of Health reported. Almost 200 000 people have been infected with coronavirus in the country and the number deaths in one day topped 100 for the 1st time in months on Sunday [14 Jun 2020]. After starting to gradually ease its lockdown in mid-April [2020], Iran has had a sharp rise in infections in recent weeks, with 5 provinces rated red zones, or coronavirus hot spots.

Iran recorded 87 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 9272. Infections in the country has reached 197 647, with a reported 156 991 recoveries.

"The statistics show that in recent days every 12 to 15 minutes an Iranian lost their life because of corona," the Iranian judiciary news agency Mizan tweeted on Thursday [18 Jun 2020]. The Iranian Parliament's research centre issued a report in April [2020] that suggested the number of coronavirus death might be almost twice as many as those announced by the health ministry.

Despite the recent surge in infections and deaths, Friday prayers were scheduled to resume in Tehran starting next week, the official IRNA news agency said.

President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday [13 Jun 2020] that Iran would reimpose restrictions to stem the surge in cases if health regulations were not observed. But footage on state TV in recent days showed many Iranians in shopping malls and on public transport not practising social distancing or wearing masks or gloves.

[As of 18 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 197 647, including 9272 deaths, an increase of 2596 cases and 87 deaths since 17 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. While this media report mentions 5 provinces are declared in the "red zone", other media reports have mentioned 10 or 11 zones. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to the lifting of restrictions too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing. This is a tenacious virus, and the overwhelming majority of the world is still susceptible to it ...

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 263 651, including 120 688 deaths, an increase from 2 234 471 cases and 119 941 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 208 097 as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 18 Jun 2020 including 17 507 confirmed deaths and an additional 4692 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, and Ohio.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Florida (surpassing Pennsylvania in the past 24 hours), Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Maryland. California, Texas, and Florida have high daily newly confirmed cases and may well change the ordering of this list over the coming week or so. A total of 39 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
