A point of clarification is in order on the historical comments from
the posting Tularemia - USA (Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts)
20020611.4465. Though the contributions to our knowledge on tularemia
by Edward Francis are unmatched, he cannot be given credit for the
discovery of the etiologic agent of tularemia, _Francisella
tularensis_. Dr. George W. McCoy, Director of the U.S. Public Health
Service plague laboratory, went to San Francisco in 1908, as
following the earthquake of 1906 there were human cases of bubonic
plague in the area. He examined both rats and ground squirrels for
the presence of lesions consistent with plague and inoculated guinea
pigs with material from suspicious lesions. _Yersinia (then
_Bacterium_) pestis_ was isolated on culture media from some of the
guinea pigs, but in others no organism was isolated. He called this a
"plague-like disease of rodents," as he concluded that it was not due
to _Y. pestis_. McCoy's work was based on 46 naturally infected
squirrels from 9 counties in California, and the organism was named
after Tulare County, where it was first discovered.
Early diagnoses in humans included the serodiagnosis by Chapin, who
worked with McCoy and developed a febrile incapacitating illness (in
himself and in a lab worker) and the first isolation from a human
case by William B. Wherry and B. H. Lamb of the University of
Cincinnati, who isolated the organism in 1912 from a case of
oculoglandular tularemia.
Dr. Francis didn't begin working on tularemia until 1919, when as a
public health officer he was sent to Utah to investigate deerfly
fever, which had been described in the medical community of Utah
beginning in 1910. Francis inoculated guinea pigs and rabbits with
blood from a patient with ulceroglandular tularemia who subsequently
died of the disease. Francis recognized the lesions in the animals as
consistent with those described by McCoy. Spleen from the dead
patient, which was abnormal, was inoculated into guinea pigs from
which _Francisella tularensis_ (then _Bacterium tularense_) was
isolated.
Francis's accomplishments, other than superb clinical descriptions of
tularemia, included:
- the demonstration that deerflies are able to transmit the disease
- isolation of the organism from 17 jackrabbits in Utah
- the demonstration that suspensions of splenic tissue from rabbits
dying of tularemia, when dropped on the unbroken skin of normal
guinea pigs, were able to transmit the disease (this was performed
because Francis, Lake, and Mayne all developed tularemia despite no
deerfly bites)
- transmission from rabbit to rabbit by the rabbit louse
- isolation of the organism from cottontail rabbits during an
epidemic of tularemia in Washington, D.C. among meat handlers
- the susceptibility of the coyote to _F. tularensis_ when fed
infected rabbits and guinea pigs
- the finding (along with Parker and Spencer) that the wood tick,
_Dermacentor andersoni_, transmits the disease in sheep
- the anatomical distribution of _F. tularensis_ in ticks
- the confirmation that Japanese cases of Ohara's disease are due to
_F. tularensis_
The interested reader may wish to find the out-of-print book
"Tularemia. History, pathology, diagnosis and treatment" by Walter M.
Simpson (with a foreword by Edward Francis), published by Paul B.
Hoeber, Inc., (1929) from which much of the above is extracted.
