Cantabrians who have unprotected sex or who have multiple sex partners are being urged to get a sexual health check for Christmas. The health advice follows the release of the 2014 Institute of Environmental Science and Research Limited sexually transmitted infections surveillance report, which shows relatively high levels of syphilis in Canterbury.

According to the report the annual number of infectious syphilis cases reported by Sexual Health Clinics (SHCs) in New Zealand has increased from 82 in 2013 to 140 cases last year [2014]. The highest case numbers of syphilis in SHCs were seen in the Auckland region (85 cases) and Canterbury DHB [District Health Board] (27 cases). Dr Ramon Pink, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, says the increase is partly due to dating apps leading to a rise in unprotected sexual encounters. "There was a big spike in Canterbury a few years ago with the number of reported cases increasing from 8 in 2010 to 29 in 2012. Since then the number of cases has remained stable, with 28 cases reported in 2013 and 27 cases in 2014," Dr Pink says. He says syphilis can often go undiagnosed because those infected do not notice any obvious symptoms."

Of the 121 syphilis cases reported amongst gay and bisexual men in 2014, only 37 percent reported symptoms. "The majority of people reporting with syphilis have no symptoms. This can mean people become complacent about the risks and end up spreading it unknowingly," Dr Pink says. Dr Heather Young, Sexual Health Physician at the Christchurch Sexual Health Centre, says syphilis can produce a painless sore on your penis, in your anus or in your mouth 10 to 90 days after infection. The sore usually turns into a scab and heals after 2-6 weeks, but the infection remains. "If you don't get treatment it may progress to secondary syphilis which can produce a generalised rash, often on palms or soles of the feet," Dr Young says. "If left untreated, syphilis can cause damage to your nerves, bones, skin, eyes and brain."

While nearly all reported cases are male, health officials are concerned about the impact of it spreading to the female population. "It's particularly dangerous for pregnant women, as syphilis can cause congenital defects," Dr Young says. Syphilis is easily treatable, but needs to be diagnosed. Condom use, partner reduction, screening, treatment and contact tracing can reduce transmission. Sexual health checks are available at general practice, sexual health clinics, the New Zealand Aids Foundation, and Family Planning.

[ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increased incidence of syphilis in many countries, mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and is characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. The increased syphilis incidence has been attributed to a variety of causes that promote unprotected sex among MSM, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs", multiple anonymous sex partners, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous "hookups", etc. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the Internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

The city of Auckland, New Zealand's largest and most populous urban area, with a population of 1 454 300, is located in the Auckland Region on North Island of New Zealand. The city of Christchurch, with a population of 382 000 people, is the main urban area of the Canterbury Region on New Zealand's South Island. - Mod.ML
