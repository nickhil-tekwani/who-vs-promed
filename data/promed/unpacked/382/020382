IFA [Irish Farmers Association] president John Bryan said that, as calving and lambing get under way in more herds and flocks throughout the country, an increase in positive cases of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] is being identified.

He said that while the information available from both Germany and the UK suggests the number of cases on affected farms ranges from 2 per cent to 5 per cent, there have been farms with much higher levels of problems and losses. "This is consistent with what Irish farmers are now experiencing causing financial loss, which in some cases is significant, and high levels of anxiety for all farmers who are struggling to come to terms with what was up until recently an unknown virus."

The IFA president said it is vital the Department of Agriculture develop a clear understanding of the SBV and how it is likely to evolve in order to ensure losses are kept to a minimum for farmers. Information gathered from countries experiencing their 2nd season of this virus will be important in this regard and must be used for the benefit of Irish farmers.

He said: "It is critically important in advance of this next breeding season that farmers are equipped with the best and most up-to-date advice on how to protect their animals and guard against further losses from this virus."

Mr Bryan said the Department of Agriculture has confirmed no trade restrictions are applied to affected farms as this is a non-notifiable disease with no human health implications.

The meeting of Technical talks between the Veterinary Services of the Customs Union and European Union took place in Minsk on 29-31 Jan 2013 and was dedicated to the discussion of technical issues related to the development of veterinary certificates different from the CU uniform forms of veterinary certificates. The representatives of all CU countries, Eurasian Economic Commission, DG SANCO, and EU countries took part in the meeting.

The parties reviewed a veterinary certificate model for bovine semen exported from the European Union to the Customs Union. The above mentioned certificate was not agreed upon due to diverging opinions as for bluetongue and Schmallenberg disease safety assurance. In this context, the parties agreed that it was necessary to further discuss the unresolved issues at the experts' level. A final decision would be made based on the technical experts' conclusions and scientific data.

[The following information on Schmallenberg virus (SBV) (European Shamonda-like orthobunyavirus) is derived from the website of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (Germany), last updated on 31 Jan 2013.

Causative agent:
Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is an orthobunyavirus strongly related to viruses of the Simbu serogroup, which also comprises the Akabane virus. So far, the strongest genetic similarity has been detected to the Sathuperi and Douglas viruses within this group. The genome of these viruses consists of 3 segments (S, M, and L) which encode at least 5 proteins.

Distribution:
Infections with Schmallenberg virus have so far been detected in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Austria, and Switzerland. According to unconfirmed reports, infections in further European countries are possible.

Affected animals:
So far, Schmallenberg virus has been detected in cattle, sheep, and goats. Antibodies against the virus have been found in alpaca, bison, roe deer, red deer, fallow deer, and mouflon.

Transmission:
Like other viruses of the Simbu serogroup, Schmallenberg virus is transmitted by insects (biting midges, possibly also mosquitoes or other arthropods). SBV genome has been detected in biting midges caught in Belgium, Denmark, and Germany (Brandenburg) in 2011. Vertical transmission from females to their offspring is of particular importance.

Late in 2012, the FLI 1st detected genetic material of the virus in the semen of bulls with a history of SBV infection. In some bulls with SBV-genome-positive semen samples, 1st SBV-antibodies could also be detected.

A 1st animal study showed that semen samples with high and low viral loads are potentially infectious. In cattle inoculated with SBV-genome-positive semen samples, infection was safely detected by PCR and antibody test in 2 of 6 animals. Therefore, a high sensitivity of tests for detection of SBV in semen samples is required. The FLI has supplied regional laboratories with methods for detection of SBV genome from a large variety of sample materials, including semen, for investigation in a national ring trial. In order to exclude transmission of SBV safely, semen of bulls with an SBV-positive antibody status should be investigated by means of appropriate methods according to the recommendations of the FLI.

Human health risk:
Schmallenberg virus is non-zoonotic pathogen. Investigations by the Robert Koch-Institute in persons with close contact with infected animals revealed no signs of an infection (also see risk assessment of the European Center for Disease Prevention and control: http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Forms/ECDC_DispForm.aspx?ID=795 and information of the Robert Koch-Institute: http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/Forsch/Schmallenberg.html).
