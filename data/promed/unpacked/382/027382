Two horses in Pulaski County, Virginia have tested positive for equine
infectious anemia. EIA is an acute or chronic viral disease that affects
horses and other equines. No vaccine is available to prevent the disease
and there is no known cure, but the disease is detectable through the
Coggins test.
The 2 horses were diagnosed after blood was submitted to the Wytheville
Regional Animal Health Laboratory by the owner's veterinarian to try to
identify the cause of unexplained weight loss. The owners euthanized the
horses to eliminate them as a source of infection to others.
Veterinarians with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services (VDACS) have been taking blood samples from horses within a
one-mile radius of the infected horses. They have tested 7 horses and
results are pending.
VDACS urges horse owners in all parts of the state to test their horses
routinely for the presence of EIA. The virus is spread mechanically from
infected to healthy horses by biting flies or contaminated instruments such
as hypodermic needles. It is not spread by direct horse-to-horse contact.
Signs include intermittent fever, depression, progressive weakness, weight
loss, edema, and anemia. Horse owners can keep their stock from becoming
infected by buying animals only after they have been tested and found to be
free of any evidence of the disease.

[Because EIA can be vector-transmitted, it can be difficult to control.
Also there is very little treatment for horses that are clinically ill. A
horse may test positive for the disease and have no clinical signs, at
least for a bit. Also, foals may initially test positive if from a positive
dam, but after maternal antibodies clear, the foal may test negative. - Mod.TG]
