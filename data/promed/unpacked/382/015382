Abstract
--------
In mid-July 2013, an outbreak of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) was observed in a herd of camels after they were imported from Kuwait to the Khuzestan province in southwest of Iran. The clinical signs of the affected animals included sudden death, fever, oral erosion, and ecthyma-like lesions, yellowish diarrhea, pneumonia and respiratory distress, enlargement of lymph node, severe dehydration, dermatitis, ulcerative keratitis, and conjunctivitis. Necropsy findings included keratoconjunctivitis, congestion and consolidation of the lung, paleness of the liver, and enlargement and edema of lymph nodes. Histopathological exam revealed degeneration and acute hyperemia of the lungs, fatty change and necrotic foci in the liver, tubular necrosis in the kidneys, and necrotic dermatitis. We used immunocapture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to confirm PPR virus (PPRV) and differentiate it from rinderpest virus. Then virus genome was studied by molecular analysis for detecting of strain and substrain of the virus. Immunocapture ELISA of all specimens reacted positively against PPRV antigens. Also, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results in the lung and lymph nodes of the dead camels consolidated the cause of disease to be PPRV.

The present study is the 1st report of the PPRV outbreak in camels in Iran.

Discussion
----------
[The full article and references are available at the source URL above; subscription required.]

Clinical signs, history taking, gross lesions, and laboratory findings confirmed the etiology of the observed condition in the camels in the affected region to be PPRV. PPR was first reported in 1995 in small ruminants from a western province in Iran. The disease was later reported from most provinces (n = 28) over a period of 10 years. Latter studies revealed that the Iranian PPRV isolates belong to lineage IV and are closely related to the Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, India, Tajikistan, and Chinese isolates...
