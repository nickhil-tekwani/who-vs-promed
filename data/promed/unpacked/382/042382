Fish virus discovered in Lake Michigan: Sport fish test positive,
threatening industry
------------------------------------
The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) reported Thursday [24 May
2007] that 2 sport fish have tested positive for a fatal viral
disease, and for the 1st time, the disease has been found in Lake
Michigan. The DNR said that a smallmouth bass tested positive for
viral hemorrhagic septicemia in Sturgeon Bay and a brown trout also
tested positive in Lake Michigan near Algoma in Kewaunee County.
In addition, the state's top fish biologist said that the department
has picked up other suspect fish from Lake Michigan and expected more
positive results in the big lake. The finding -- though not
unexpected -- is more bad news for Wisconsin's sport fishery, valued
by the DNR at USD 2.3 billion a year.
Thousands of muskies, walleye, lake whitefish and other fish have
died since 2005 in Lake Huron, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario, according to the DNR. However, the virus poses no threat to
humans. The discovery of the disease in Lake Michigan was expected
because the virus had been found in Lake Huron near the Mackinac
Bridge this year [2007]. The 2 water bodies are connected.
The Lake Michigan discoveries come after freshwater drum, or
sheepshead, had tested positive on inland waterways this month [May
2007]; first in Little Lake Butte des Morts and then on Lake Winnebago.
"It's disappointing, but it seemed inevitable," said Mike Staggs,
director of fisheries management and habitat protection for the DNR.
"What we are going to learn is that it is pretty solidly in Lake
Michigan." But he cautioned that the agency has found no evidence of
a large-scale die-off of sport fish anywhere in the state.
Antibodies possible
-------------------
Staggs said that he did not know the precise location of either fish,
other than that the brown trout had washed up on a beach near Algoma
and the smallmouth was caught in a net by DNR personnel looking for
the disease. Results of the tests on the brown trout were learned
Wednesday [23 May 2007] night. The test was conducted by the
University of Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. A backup
test has been sent to a federal laboratory in Ames, IA. The brown
trout exhibited signs of the disease.
The results of the smallmouth [test] were learned on Thursday [24 May
2007]. Staggs said the fish appeared to be healthy. Staggs said that
a muskellunge recovered by the DNR from the Fox River also appeared
to have contracted the disease. But he said a preliminary test of
that fish was negative.
Infected fish transmit the virus through their urine and reproductive
fluids. The virus eventually causes blood vessels to weaken and
hemorrhage, according to the DNR. Some fish can develop antibodies.
But over time, antibodies can decline, and the fish can start
secreting the virus again and create new cycles of infection. Even
after the virus leaves the fish, scientists have found that it can
move through the water and infect other fish for 14 days. Staggs said
the virus has even been known to stay alive in frozen bait.
Rules unchanged
----------------
The latest discovery will not prompt the DNR to adjust emergency
rules approved last week [14-18 May 2007] that place restrictions on
boaters and anglers in the Lake Winnebago system, because those rules
also included rivers and their tributaries up to the first dam where
fish could not pass restrictions for Lake Michigan, Lake Superior and
the Mississippi River.
The emergency regulations prohibit people from moving live fish,
including bait minnows, from one waterway to another. The rules also
require anglers to drain their bait buckets when they are done
fishing. Boaters are required to drain water from their boat, bilge
or live well.
