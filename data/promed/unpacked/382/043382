The number of people hit by food poisoning in Jordan after eating hummus
(ground chickpeas) from a restaurant in Jerash south of the capital, rose
Sat 27 Oct 2007, to nearly 300, the health minister said. Salah al-Mawajdeh
told state-run Petra news agency that more than 90 people suffering from
diarrhea and fever have been taken to Jerash and Amman hospitals. He said
the health authorities have shut down the restaurant and are currently
investigating the possibility of an outbreak of salmonella or cholera.
"They are in stable health condition now and might be discharged in the
coming few hours," the minister said. Earlier, the head of the Jerash
public hospital Yousef Qoqaji told AFP that 206 people had been treated for
food poisoning and that salmonella was probably the cause.

In August [2007], 176 people were treated for salmonella poisoning after
eating tainted sandwiches from a restaurant in the Baqaa Palestinian camp
northwest of Amman, prompting the authorities to crack down on fast food
outlets.

Health authorities said the situation was improving with only dozens of new
cases admitted on Sun 28 Oct 2007, raising the total number of suspected
food poisoning cases in northern Jordan's Jerash Governorate to 338, The
Jordan Times reported on Mon 29 Oct 2007.

Yousef Qoqazeh, director of Jerash Public Hospital, was quoted as saying
that only 10 citizens were still receiving treatment in the hospital out of
the 52 who were admitted on 27 Oct 2007. "The patients' conditions are
stable and they are expected to be discharged within 24 hours," said Qoqazeh.

On Fri 26 Oct 2007, hundreds of residents in the village of Sakeb,
suffering from fever, diarrhea, and vomiting, were rushed to Jerash Public
Hospital with authorities initially blaming the problem on food poisoning
from a local restaurant, which was closed down as a precautionary measure.

Jerash governor, Ali Azzam, said initial tests carried out on potable water
samples taken from the village turned out negative. "We also sent hummus
and water samples to the National Laboratories in Amman and to the King
Abdullah I Hospital in Irbid to carry out more sophisticated tests to
determine the cause of the incident," he said, adding that results normally
need 48 to 72 hours.

[Hummus is a creamy puree of chickpeas and tahini (sesame seed paste)
seasoned with lemon juice and garlic, and is a popular spread and dip in
Greece and throughout the Middle East. It can be garnished in many ways,
including sprinkling paprika, parsley, cumin (popular in Egypt), pine nuts
(traditional in Palestinian hummus), tomatoes, cucumber, thinly sliced
onions, sauteed mushrooms, or with whole chickpeas over the top before
drizzling with olive oil. Hummus was the vehicle for a large outbreak of
salmonellosis in Chicago, IL, USA earlier this year (2007).

The etiology of this relatively large outbreak is not entirely clear but
several sources have implicated salmonellosis. ProMED-mail has posted 2
previous outbreaks of salmonellosis in Jordan in 2007. The apparent rapid
recovery of the hospitalized individuals, however, might suggest a
norovirus etiology.
