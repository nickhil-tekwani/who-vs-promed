Tomato flu [Hand, foot, mouth disease]: 26 children detected in Odisha, condition stable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 26 children have been diagnosed with the hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in Odisha and their condition is stable, a health official said on Tuesday [24 May 2022].

Commonly known as the 'tomato flu', the infectious disease is caused by intestinal viruses and occurs mostly in children. The illness is rare in adults as they usually have immune systems strong enough to defend them from the virus.

In most cases, the viral illness has symptoms like fever, painful sores in the mouth and rash with blisters on hands, feet and buttocks, according to the World Health Organization.

Out of the 36 samples that were collected and tested in the Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneswar, 26 were found to be positive, Health Services director Bijay Mohapatra told reporters.

Of the HFMD-infected children, 19 are from Bhubaneswar, 3 from Puri and 2 each from Cuttack and Puri, according to Mohapatra.

Kerala and Tamil Nadu have been battling a new virus for the past 2 weeks. The state of Kerala has registered 82 cases of 'Tomato Flu' or 'Tomato Fever' as per the local media.

The Kerala Health Department has been closely monitoring the situation as the disease affects children below the age of 5. All the 82 cases of Tomato Fever were reported in Kollam city. What is particularly worrying is that all confirmed cases are of children below 5 years and they have been reported from local government hospitals.

Highlights:
- The Kerala state health department has reportedly been monitoring the situation closely and has taken preventive measures. The cases have been reported from Aryankavu, Anchal and Neduvathur.
- Children usually experience rashes and skin irritation and dehydration.
- Besides, children also feel tiredness, the colour of their hands and legs change, they feel joint pain, feel cramps in the stomach, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, coughing, sneezing, and wheezing.
- Tomato flu, also known as Tomato fever [hand, foot, and mouth disease], is a very common kind of fever where children below 5 years of age get infected.

[Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the primary pathogen that might cause severe symptoms and even death in children with HFMD, but other enteroviruses and coxsackie viruses also cause this disease. It's found in the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, and anus.

The virus is spread from person to person when a sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can get it if you touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after touching something contaminated with the virus, such as a toy. You can also get it if you touch the stool or blisters of a person who is infected.

Mostly the infected child experiences rashes and skin irritation and dehydration. The virus causes blisters on several parts of the body. The name Tomato flu or Tomato fever is derived from the fact that these blisters are usually round in shape and red in colour.

The etiologic agent needs to be distinguished from the mosquito-borne viruses, chikungunya virus and dengue virus, which also cause rashes. - Mod.LK
