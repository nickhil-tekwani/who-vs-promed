Somalia: polio outbreak confirmed in Mogadishu and Kenya
--------------------------------------------------------
The 1st confirmed case of the wild poliovirus (WPV1) in Somalia since 2007 has been reported in Mogadishu on [9 May 2013].

Since then, 14 WPV cases have been reported and also 2 WPV cases in Kenya [see comment following this newswire as the total number of cases reported in Somalia and Kenya combined is 14. - Mod.MPP] Experts have warned the outbreak could spread to neighbouring countries and a surveillance alert for polio has been issued to all countries across the Horn of Africa. There is a great risk that the disease can reach Somaliland. Globally, 3 countries remain polio endemic (Nigeria, Pakistan, and Afghanistan). As long as polio exists anywhere in the world, all children are at risk from polio if not vaccinated.

Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus which invades the nervous system, and can cause irreversible paralysis (usually in the legs) or even death in a matter of hours. The poliovirus enters through the mouth, in water or food contaminated with faecal material from an infected person. The virus multiplies in the intestine and is excreted by the infected person in faeces, which can pass on the virus to others.

There is no cure for polio but it can be prevented through giving children several doses of the oral polio vaccine. The vaccine is essential protection for children and we urge all parents, mothers, and caregivers to make sure that their children under the age of 5 are vaccinated now. The vaccine is available at all health centres and will be made available during the National Immunization Days (NIDs) exercise also. The vaccinators will be coming to your house to immunize your children.

Dates for next the National immunization Days (NIDs) in Somaliland:
16-19 Jun 2013
1-4 Jul 2013
18-21 Aug 2013
16-19 Dec 2013

[According to the most recent figures from the Polio Eradication Initiative (see section [3] below), there have been a total of 14 cases of polio associated with the WPV1 circulating in Somalia and the Dadaab region of Kenya combined, with 9 cases reported in Somalia, and 5 cases reported in Kenya. Clarification of these numbers would be greatly appreciated, as it is always possible that additional cases have been reported since the preparation of the weekly update on the Polio Eradication Initiative website.

Traces of poliovirus found in sewers in Ashdod and other locales in southern Israel
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traces of poliovirus have been detected in the sewage systems of a number of locations in the south, including Kiryat Gat and Ashdod. This follows the discovery last week [3 Jun 2013] of poliovirus in the Be'er Sheva sewage system, a strain similar to one recently found in Egypt [see prior ProMED-mail posts referenced below].

The Health Ministry believes that all of the traces of poliovirus originate in the Bedouin town of Rahat, after the virus was found in the sewers there at the end of March [2013].

The ministry has not received any reports of individuals contracting polio as a result, but is continuing to pursue its polio vaccination campaign among children and adults in the Negev town of Rahat, in an effort to head off an outbreak.

The presence of poliovirus in Rahat's sewage system is evidence that one or more residents of the town have been excreting the virus at its infectious stage.

Polio has been virtually eradicated in most developed countries through vaccinations.

The disease, which can cause permanent paralysis, is still prevalent in some 3rd world countries. Booster shots are available for those who have been vaccinated but are at risk of exposure.

As part of a national program, babies are vaccinated against the disease at 2, 4, and 6 months of age, at one year, and then again at school in grades 2 and 8.

The type of poliovirus found in Rahat is similar to the polio discovered last year [2012] in Egypt and it was apparently brought to Rahat by someone who had been infected with the disease in Egypt.

Health clinics in the south are being urged to make sure babies are properly vaccinated.

"Hygiene rules should be scrupulously observed, particularly washing one's hands after using the bathroom, before having contact with food, and after changing babies' diapers to avoid contracting the virus," the Health Ministry said.

"There is no [polio] contamination of the water system and no need to boil water in those communities in which polio has been detected in the sewage, and there is no change in policy regarding the communities in the vicinity of Rahat."

This year's [2013] outbreak is not the 1st evidence of the persistence of polio in Israel. Traces of the virus were found in the Tel Aviv area's sewage system most recently in 2005, and led to a program to ensure that children were getting vaccinated.

[Kiryat Gat and Ashdod are both located in the Southern District of Israel to the north and north west of Be'er Sheva and Rahat, where identification of WPV1 in sewage samples was reported earlier (see http://www.ezilon.com/maps/asia/israel-maps.html for a map of Israel showing locations of key cities around the country).

The identification of WPV1 in sewage samples in multiple locations without identification of clinical cases of polio most likely suggests that there is "silent" circulation of WPV1 ongoing in the Southern District of the country, with infection of more than one individual and in more than one location. Achievement of high vaccination levels in these areas should hopefully interrupt the transmission of this WPV and prevent clinical cases of polio.

- Outbreak response activities are continuing across the Horn of Africa.
- In Somalia, 2 large-scale immunization campaigns have already been implemented, including in Banadir (which includes Mogadishu), including targeting children aged less than 10 years. Lessons from these campaigns are now being addressed in preparation of the next rounds starting on [12 Jun 2013]. In Banadir, all age groups are being targeted. Focus is on fine-tuning microplans to include schools, more clearly define vaccinator team daily workloads, improving supervision, and expanding the scope and content of monitoring activities.
- In Kenya, immunization activities began on [26 May 2013] to reach nearly 440 000 children aged less than 15 years across the Dadaab area. Preparations are ongoing for the next SNIDs, on [15 Jun 2013], covering broader areas including all age groups in the Dadaab area. Further campaigns planned for late June and mid-August [2013].
- Immunization campaigns are also planned and being conducted in other areas of the Horn of Africa, notably Ethiopia and Yemen, to urgently boost population immunity levels and minimize the risk of spread of the outbreak.
- In Ethiopia, in border areas with Kenya and Somalia, an immunization activity was held on [31 May 2013] (targeting children aged less than 15 years). Focus was particularly on reaching children in refugee camps. Broader activities are planned to start [16 Jun 2013] and in early July [2013].
- In Yemen, activities were held last week [2-5 Jun 2013] to reach 2.1 million children, with a 2nd round planned for late June [2013] to reach 3.5 million children and NIDs in August [2013].

-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- Multi-country immunization campaigns were conducted on 24-27 May [2013], using trivalent OPV, across West Africa. The activity followed a multi-country campaign at end-April [2013] in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone, to reach nearly 30 million children under the age of 5 years. Ghana and Togo conducted activities on [1-3 Jun 2013]. Niger will conduct subnational immunization activities on [15-18 Jun 2013] (with bivalent OPV).

[The outbreak in Somalia and Kenya has been ongoing since early May 2013. As the most recent dates of onset of paralysis of the confirmed cases to date were in mid-May (16 and 18 May 2013 in Somalia and Kenya respectively), it would not be surprising if there were additional cases identified before the transmission cycle is interrupted with the intensified vaccination activities begun in response to these outbreaks.

The concerns raised about potential spread to other countries in the Horn of Africa are valid, as vaccination levels have not been consistently high. Data from WHO and UNICEF estimates of vaccination coverages in Yemen (revised in 2011) show that during the period 2000 through 2011, OPV3 (3rd dose of oral polio vaccine) levels were about 80 per cent, ranging from a low of 66 per cent in 2003 to a high of 88 per cent in 2010 (see http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/data/yem.pdf). In Ethiopia, the OPV3 estimates during the period 2000 to 2011 ranged from a low of 44 per cent in 2003 to a high of 62 per cent in 2011 (see http://www.who.int/immunization_monitoring/data/eth.pdf).
