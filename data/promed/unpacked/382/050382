[The following include the first reports of potato ring rot, _Clavibacter
michiganensis_, in Cyprus, the Netherlands, & possibly Syria (found in an
intercepted consignment), & its further spread in Germany. - Mod.JW]

Surveys on Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus and Ralstonia
solanacearum in Germany
------------------------------------
The NPPO of Germany has recently informed the EPPO Secretariat of the
results of surveys carried out for _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ and _Ralstonia solanacearum_ (both EPPO A2 quarantine pests)
on the 1997 potato harvest and part of the 1998 harvest.
Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus
-------------------------------------
Official tests (IF, and in some laboratories IF and PCR) were done in
German lander for latent infections in seed and ware potatoes. In addition,
visual inspections were also carried out. The number of infested lots found
in 1997/1998 was twice as high as in 1996. The origin of these infestations
is not known.
1997 harvest: 13 953 samples were tested (10 987 seed potatoes - 2966 ware
potatoes) and 23 positive cases were found on seed potatoes and 41 on ware
potatoes.
1998 harvest (in part): so far, 13 800 samples have been tested (10 476
seed potatoes - 3324 ware potatoes) and 18 positive cases were found on
seed potatoes and 28 on ware potatoes. Phytosanitary measures are being
applied aiming at the eradication of the
disease.
Ralstonia solanacearum
---------------------------------
Concerning the 1997 harvest, 13 029 samples were tested in the laboratory
following the EU protocol, and additional visual inspections were done. _R.
solanacearum_ was only found in 2 cases (ware potatoes) at harvest time. In
Bayern, the bacterium was found in 2 water samples in a small river and in
1 sample of _Solanum dulcamara_. Tests were done in this river, because it
received liquid waste from a potato factory which had processed some
infected potatoes in 1996. Strict phytosanitary measures are applied to
control the bacterium and prevent any further spread, and it is expected to
eradicate it in a near future.

Surveys on potato ring rot and brown rot in Finland
---------------------------------------------------
In Finland, systematic surveys for _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ (potato ring rot - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) started in the
1980s. At the beginning, only visual inspections were done, but since 1994
most inspected samples are also tested in the laboratory for latent
infections. In addition, surveys are now also done for _Ralstonia
solanacearum_ (potato brown rot - EPPO A2 quarantine pest) every year on
seed and ware potatoes. These surveys are carried out in the most important
potato-growing areas in Finland. Results for the Finnish potato production,
as well as for potato imports in 1997 and spring 1998, are the following.
Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus
----------------------------------------------
Sampling and laboratory testing followed the EU Directive 93/85. Ware
potato production (including industrial potatoes): In total, 1905 samples
were collected, inspected and tested. After biological tests (on
aubergine), _C. michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ was found in 68 samples
(from 42 different farms, i.e. 12% infested farms which is similar to
previous years). However, it is noted that the most important
potato-growing area which is located in Northern Ostrobothnia
(Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, on the west coast) is practically free from the
disease. In addition, ring rot has not been found for many years in the
'high grade area', and its incidence is very low in the food industry
potato production.
Seed potato production: In total, 1443 samples were tested (including
pre-basic material: 78 samples), and 1081 samples were also visually
inspected in seed potato farms. No ring rot was found.
Imported potatoes: during summer 1997 and spring 1998, 262 samples of ware
and seed potatoes imported from EU countries were inspected and tested. _C.
michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ was found in 2 samples of industrial
potatoes from Sweden.
Ralstonia solanacearum
----------------------------------
Finnish potato production: 139 ware potato samples (from 134 farms) and 60
seed potato samples (from 58 farms) were tested in the laboratory and no
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ was found.
Imported potatoes: 262 samples of imported potatoes were tested and no _R.
solanacearum_ was found.

Isolated finding of ring rot in Dutch potato crop
-----------------------------------------------
During a routine test carried out by the Dutch NPPO, bacterial ring rot
(_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ - EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) has been discovered in Dutch seed potatoes. It is the first time that
this disease has been found in Dutch potatoes.
An in-depth investigation into the cause of the outbreak has been carried
out. All the information currently available suggests that this is an
isolated infection. In order
to combat the disease each member state of the EU is carrying out research
into the incidence of bacterial ring rot. Ring rot had not previously
occurred in Dutch potatoes, but the disease was present in a number of
other member states including Germany and Denmark. This had prompted the
Netherlands to intensify its tests for ring rot in recent years.
Approximately 7500 samples of potatoes from the 1997 harvest were tested
and found to be free from the disease. 7100 samples from the 1998 harvest
have so far been tested. The presence of ring rot in one sample of the
Ottena race has been confirmed. This sample comes from a consignment of
seed potatoes grown from own seed in the province of Overijssel close to
the German border. All clonally related consignments have been tested and
found to be free from ring rot. There is no evidence of any spread of the
disease in the Netherlands.
The measures to eradicate the contamination and prevent the spread of the
disease have been taken in accordance with the EU requirements. This means
among other things that the contaminated consignment has been destroyed,
that the other consignments of seed
potatoes from the infected farm are no longer designated as seed potatoes,
and that the contaminated land may not be used for growing potatoes for a
period of three or four years.

_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest): was observed on 1 site in Borota (BÃ¡cs-Kiskun county) on tomato
plants (similar to last year, see EPPO RS 98/141).

First report of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis in Cyprus
-------------------------------------------------------------
The EPPO Secretariat has recently been informed by the NPPO of Cyprus of
the first finding of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) on tomatoes in Cyprus. In July 1998, symptoms of
bacterial canker were observed in several tomato field crops in Eftagonia
(Limassol district) and later in Odou (Larnaca district) and Pharmaca
(Nicosia district). The incidence of infection ranged between 5 to 90 %.
The tomato cultivars grown in the area were A178, A179 and Graciella. The
latter cultivar had a lower infection rate. The causal agent was identified
as _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_. The identification
was also confirmed by the Bacteriology Laboratory at the Benaki
Phytopathological Institute, Athens, Greece.

EPPO report on selected intercepted consignments
The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the intercepted consignment reports
received since the previous report (EPPO RS 99/052):
1) for 1998 from Hungary,
2) for 1999 from the following countries: Austria, Denmark, Estonia,
France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland,
Portugal, United Kingdom. When a consignment has been re-exported and the
country of origin is unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in
brackets. When the occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to
the EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected interceptions made because of the
presence of pests. Other interceptions due to prohibited commodities,
missing or invalid certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out
that the report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their interception reports.
