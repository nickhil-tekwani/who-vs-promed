Woman bitten by rabies-infected ferret-badger in Chiayi [County]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A woman living in mountainous Meishan Township in Chiayi County was bitten by a ferret-badger that was later found to be infected with rabies, the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said Friday [30 Oct 2015]

It is the 1st rabies case reported in the township since rabies was rediscovered in Taiwan in 2013 after the island had been free of the disease since the early 1960s, the bureau said.

The 79-year-old woman was attacked by the ferret-badger in the yard of her home on Tuesday [27 Oct 2015], according to the bureau. After the body of the animal was sent for tests, it was confirmed Thursday [29 Oct 2015] to be rabies-positive. The woman has been given a rabies immune globulin injection and rabies vaccine for humans.

Rabies cases have been reported in 72 townships in 9 counties and cities around Taiwan since 2013, the bureau said. The disease has been confined mainly to wild ferret-badgers, with only a few cases involving masked palm civets.

[Chiayi County is on the south west coast of Taiwan; see http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/taiwan_pol92.jpg. Meishan is to the NNE of the county capital Chia; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TW/07/Meishan.html.

The report has an excellent photograph of a dead ferret-badger (_Melogale moschata_). Ferret-badgers are carnivorous species of the mustelid family. They are the major source for rabies virus on the island. - Mod.MHJ
