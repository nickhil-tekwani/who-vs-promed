[This report includes information released by official and other sources up
to Fri 29 Jun 2001, edited for presentation in ProMED-mail.
Since the preceding West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance report of Fri 22 Jun
2001, one more West Nile virus-positive crow has been reported in Maryland
(Baltimore). The New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services has
not updated test results since the Wed 20 Jun 2001, and the dead crow count
remains at 14.
Therefore the tally of WNV-positive birds for 2001 now stands at: New
Jersey 14, Maryland 4, New York 2, Rhode Island 2, and Connecticut 1. So
far, the only report of West Nile virus-positive mosquitoes has come from
New Jersey. - Mod.CP

Former Surgeon General Says West Nile Here to Stay
--------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: Americans should expect more outbreaks of the potentially fatal
West Nile fever, a former US Deputy Surgeon General said on Tue 26 Jun
2001. The disease is carried by many species of migratory birds and spread
to humans through several mosquito species. It sickened some 25 people in
the Northeast last spring and summer and killed at least 10. [In fact,there
were 21 confirmed human cases and 2 deaths in the year 2000, and 62 serious
cases including 7 deaths in 1999. - Mod.CP Many areas, including New York
City, have undertaken aggressive surveillance and pest control measures in
an effort to stem future outbreaks. But the birds that harbor the virus
migrate so widely that there is little hope of totally controlling the
disease here, said Robert A. Whitney, a veterinarian who served as Deputy
Surgeon General from 1992 to 1994. "West Nile virus will continue to spread
through most countries in the Western Hemisphere," said Whitney, who also
served a stint as Acting Surgeon General under President Clinton in 1993.
Whitney was speaking at a forum on communicable diseases sponsored by the
National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. "I think we probably should be
prepared to just accept a low level of West Nile virus in the US", Whitney
said in an interview.

[A contrary argument might be that the spread of West Nile virus in North
America may be slow until a less virulent strain of the virus evolves. The
current strain appears to be highly lethal for birds (particularly crows)
and to have limited infectivity for non-avian hosts. By contrast, high
mortality in birds is not associated with West Nile virus infection in
endemic areas where there have been significant outbreaks in the human
population (e.g., Romania). West Nile virus is more likely to be spread
rapidly by bird migration once its present lethality has moderated. - Mod.CP

West Nile Virus Surveillance Meeting at Lincoln Park Zoo
--------------------------------------------------------
Health experts from around the nation met this week at Lincoln Park Zoo to
come up with a plan to watch for West Nile virus and contain it. The
meeting was the first national gathering of public health experts with
those from zoos and wildlife to discuss the virus, zoo spokeswoman Kelly
McGrath said. It signals a growing consensus that cooperation between such
groups is needed to combat this potentially deadly virus. "What we're
trying to do today is break down those man-made barriers that were ignored
by the birds and mosquitoes that transmit the virus", said Tracey McNamara
of the Wildlife Conservation Society. The meeting comes at the beginning of
the third year since the virus was discovered in the United States. Since
it was discovered in 1999 in New York, the virus has been found in 12
states along the East Coast.
Of particular concern to health experts is that the virus has spread
farther west and at a quicker pace than they anticipated. It has been
discovered as far west as Erie, Pennsylvania. Experts in Michigan say they
already have seen the kinds of mosquitoes that can transmit the virus and
have predicted that it could reach parts of the state this summer. A
species of mosquito that can transmit the disease is also in Chicago and
throughout the country, Duane Gubler of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said at the meeting on Fri 22 Jun 2001.
In Chicago, the threat has been taken seriously enough to prompt the zoo
and city officials to create an early-warning system to try to detect the
virus in birds and insects before it makes people ill. The system calls for
testing mosquitoes trapped at the zoo and drawing blood from the zoo's
flamingos, chickens and other birds. Gubler said the CDC has developed a
plan to monitor the spread of the virus. But he said it has lacked input
from places such as Lincoln Park Zoo, which can test animals as well as
trap mosquitoes. He also said the plan will be particularly important
because it could be implemented to combat the spread of subsequent and
potentially more serious viruses. Officials said it is too early to list
specific components of the plan, which will be revealed in a report later.
But Gubler said it certainly will call for the development of
mosquito-abatement programs. Dominic Travis, the zoo's epidemiologist, said
the report is only the first step. After that, he said, "we have to recruit
institutions to participate."

[The key role of the zoo veterinarians in the events leading up to
identification of the agent responsible for the first outbreak of West Nile
virus in North America is thoroughly documented in the GAO Report to
Congress on the "West Nile Virus Outbreak -- Lessons for Public Health
Preparedness", which was published in September 2000 <http://www.gao.gov>.
It is to be hoped that there will be more systematic involvement of zoo and
wildlife experts in this third year of West Nile virus surveillance. - Mod.MPP

No Additional West Nile Virus-positive Test Results
---------------------------------------------------
As of Wed 27 Jun 2001, there have been no new confirmations of West Nile
virus (WNV) anywhere in the State of Connecticut during the past week.
During the first 7 weeks, 715 dead bird sightings were reported, including
277 crows. Birds were submitted for testing from 63 towns, 38 birds are in
process, and testing has been completed on 112 birds, with 111 negative and
one positive (reported on 23 May 2001 in Milford).
There are no cases of WNV reported for humans, domestic animals or poultry.
No isolations of WNV were reported in the 11 592 mosquitoes collected and
tested as of 26 Jun 2001.

West Nile Virus Surveillance Testing Results
--------------------------------------------
As of Sat 23 Jun 2001, 4 dead birds (of 390 tested) have tested positive
for West Nile virus. [An increase of one since the last post. These
positive birds were all submitted from Baltimore City. One horse sample was
submitted and tested negative for West Nile virus.
Over 3400 mosquito pools, ranging in quantities of from one to 40
mosquitoes, have been submitted for West Nile virus testing. All mosquito
testing results have been negative.
Official WNV surveillance findings can be found now on the Maryland
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's web page at
(rather than the previously posted [Montgomery County, Maryland WNV
information web site.)
