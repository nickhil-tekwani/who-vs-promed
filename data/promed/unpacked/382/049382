Avian influenza: The Netherlands
---------------------------------
BRUSSELS: The Dutch representative of the Standing Committee on the Food
Chain and Animal Health gave a detailed report on the situation and a
provisional result of the monitoring programme launched in the whole
country. The committee agreed to extend the restrictive measures (now
applicable until 20 March) until 27 March at midnight. However, the
movements within the Netherlands have been slightly eased. From 21 March
onwards, poultry for immediate slaughter including spent laying hens,
day-old chickens and pullets and hatching eggs may be transported within
the Netherlands in areas outside the surveillance zones. The situation and
the measures adopted will be reviewed by the Committee next Tuesday, 25 March.

[The Dutch ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management & Fisheries reported
on Wed, 19 Mar 2003 that the total number of poultry plants (production
facilities) affected by fowl plague (highly pathogenic avian influenza,
HPAI) has reached 100, of which 60 are "definitely infected" while 40 are,
at present, regarded "highly suspected". Up to the date of report, 209
poultry plants have been depopulated, including 3.2 million birds.
Following the detection of a new outbreak, highly suspected to be fowl
plague, in Kootwijkerbroek, the animal-movement-restriction zone of the
Gelders Valley has been extended. - Mod.AS]
