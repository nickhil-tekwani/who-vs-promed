[Classical swine fever (CSF or hog cholera) occurs in parts of Africa.
This disease is distinct from African Swine Fever, which is endemic in
Africa's swine population. Over the past few years, the only country in
the African region that consistently reports CSF to the OIE is
Madagascar. Mauritius [which is an island to the east of Madagascar]
last reported the disease to OIE in 1994. The fact that this is occurring
in unvaccinated pigs implies that this outbreak is due to a lack of
vaccination coverage in a country where the disease is endemic. -
