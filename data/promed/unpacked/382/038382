Doctors are warning that there could be an anthrax outbreak in several
regencies in Central Java after one villager recently died in the town of
Boyolali. Head of the provincial health office Krishnajaya said on Monday
evening that the infectious disease of cattle could flare up in some
subdistricts in Boyolali, Demak, and Semarang.
Anthrax claimed the life of a 14-year-old boy from Jemowo village in Musuk
subdistrict. He died at Boyolali's Pandan Arang public hospital on Feb. 26
after being infected with anthrax bacillus, Krishnajaya said. He said the
cause of [the boy's death was determined last Saturday when the Semarang
health laboratory office announced the result of its test on the victim's
blood sample.
"A health team from Boyolali has conducted an investigation at the
location, where the victim lived, and its surroundings but so far there is
no indication of an anthrax outbreak there," Krishnajaya said. He explained
that the team had interviewed [the deceased's neighbors and looked into a
number of farm animals, particularly cattle, at the village of Jemowo. The
doctor was not sure how the victim had been infected with the disease. But
he underlined that several days before his death, [the persons affected
had eaten bakso (soup with meatballs) he bought from a food stall near the
hospital.
A goat was found dead near the victim's house 2 months before [the human
victim died, but the cause of its death remains unknown, Krishnajaya
added. He said anthrax was believed to have attacked [his digestive tract,
resulting in high fever, convulsions, vomiting, stomach cramps and
respiratory problems. [His death was categorized as an "extraordinary
case" as the outbreak of the disease was not detected in his subdistrict,
Krishnajaya said. He said that in Boyolali, anthrax bacillus could be found
in at least 4 subdistricts of Ampel, Teras, Mojosongo, and Cepogo.
Data from Krishnajaya's office shows that at least 126 cases of anthrax
were found, with 20 fatalities in the 1990-2001 period. At least 18 of the
deaths were recorded in 1990 alone from 90 cases in Teras.
