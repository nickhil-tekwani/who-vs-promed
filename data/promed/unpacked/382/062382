Tick-borne encephalitis in 2 Dutch travellers returning from Austria,
Netherlands, July and August 2011 (By: Reusken C, Reimerink J, Verduin
C, Sabbe L, Cleton N, and Koopmans M.)

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is not endemic in the Netherlands, and
diagnostics are seldom requested. Here, we report about the rare event
of TBE in 2 Dutch travellers returning from Austria in July and August
2011. This report serves to create awareness among physicians to
consider travel-related TBE in their differential diagnosis of
patients with neurological disease returning from TBE virus endemic
regions and to promote awareness among professionals advising
travellers.

In the Netherlands, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is not
endemic. Diagnostic requests for TBEV are not common, and, between
2006 and 2011, these averaged 17 per year (range 9-25) for the
laboratory of the Netherlands Centre for Infectious Disease Control,
which is one of the 2 laboratories in the Netherlands that perform
TBEV diagnostics. Diagnosed imported tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is
also very rare in the Netherlands.

A positive anamnesis for a stay in a TBEV endemic area (incubation
period of typically 7-14 days) and a tick bite are epidemiological
parameters that should [entail] a confirmative diagnosis based on
positive TBEV IgM and IgG responses. Based on these criteria, in the
5-year period from 2006 to 2010, only one person was diagnosed as an
acute TBEV case based on IgM and IgG seroconversion. The authors
describe 2 cases of tick-borne encephalitis in travellers returning to
the Netherlands in the summer of 2011.

Case 1. In mid-July 2011, a Dutch woman in her late 50s presented to
the general practitioner emergency post. After a few days of
dizziness, non-productive cough and fear of noise, she had, on the day
of admission, an acute fever (39 C) accompanied with severe headache
and muscle pain. Muscle weakness, nausea and vertigo were also
present. The weeks before she had made an extensive camping trip in
Austria (Prems, Pongau, Imst), followed by 2 days in the Black Forest
(Germany), where she detected a tick on her right buttock. The patient
indicated that the tick probably had been present for days. The tick
was removed 17 days before admission to the hospital. On clinical
examination no neurological abnormalities were detected. On the right
buttock there was a red induration of one cm in diameter on the
location of the tick bite. During the 10 days of admission, headache
and muscle pain were the main complaints. Serology for borreliosis was
negative. Potential infection with TBEV was suspected in an early
phase based on the clinical picture (fever and headache) in
combination with the registration of a tick-bite and the recent
leisure activities in Austria, where TBE is endemic. Serology, using
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immunozyme FSME IgM and IgG,
Progen, Heidelberg, Germany) on a serum sample taken 4 days upon onset
of disease showed high titres of TBEV specific IgM and IgG antibodies,
indicative of an active TBEV infection. The patient recovered
gradually. One month later, she only had some insignificant headache
and hypersensitivity to noise.

Case 2. At the end of August 2011, a Dutch man in his early 40s was
admitted to the hospital with a severe headache, fever and fatigue. He
also complained about impaired hearing and blurred vision. He had
returned from holidays in Austria (Carinthia) 16 days prior to
admission. In Austria, the patient had been bitten by a tick in the
neck. About a week later, the man got fever and severe headaches. He
received antibiotic treatment (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) in Austria
and showed recovery. Upon his return in the Netherlands a few days
later, his headache and fever returned and became more severe. Based
on travel history, fever and headache, meningoencephalitis was
suspected as differential diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
serum were sampled. CSF analysis showed 62 leucocytes per uL (norm:
under 5 leucocytes per uL) with a dominance of monocytes (56 per uL
(norm: 15-45 percent). CSF total protein was 909 mg/L (norm: 150-500
mg/L). Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, enterovirus and
parechovirus PCR on CSF were negative. Serology for Lyme disease was
negative as well. Initial treatment consisted of ceftriaxone and
acyclovir. Infection with TBEV was suspected based on the leisure
activities in Austria and the nature and severity of the symptoms.
Antibody testing on CSF was positive for TBEV IgG but not for IgM. His
serum showed high titres of TBEV specific IgM and IgG antibodies,
indicative of a recent TBEV infection. Subsequently, acyclovir and
cefriaxone were stopped. The patient recovered slowly. However, 7
weeks after his admission to the hospital, he still suffers from
headache, severe fatigue, hearing impairment, blurred vision and
memory problems.

Discussion: TBEV is the causative agent of TBE, the most important
viral tick-borne disease in Europe [1]. The virus is transmitted to
humans through bites of infected ticks within minutes of the tick
bite. Transmission through consumption of raw milk from infected dairy
cattle has also been described. Human-to-human transmission does not
occur [1,2-4]. The occurrence of most human cases coincides with the
occurrence of questing ticks, roughly from May to November.

The TBEV species comprises 3 distinct genetic lineages; the European
(TBEV-Eu), Far-Eastern (TBEV-FE) and Siberian (TBEV-Sib) subtypes [5].
TBEV-Eu has been isolated in Europe, TBEV-Sib in the Urals, Siberia
and far-eastern Russia, and TBEV-FE in far-eastern Russia, Japan and
China. Co-circulation of different subtypes has been recorded for
Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia [1,2-4]. The severity of
disease with TBEV aetiology varies depending on the causative
subtype.

Germany and Austria are endemic countries for TBEV with low incidence
(less than one case per 100 000 inhabitants). However, the incidence
and virus circulation in Germany varies considerably between regions,
with non-endemic areas in the north but in the south defined TBE risk
areas in Baden-Wurttemberg, Bavaria, Hesse, Thuringia and
Rhineland-Palatinate [6]. In Austria, the incidence is low due to the
high vaccination coverage (88 percent), but the circulation of TBEV is
high [7].

[The case descriptions in this report highlight the importance of
considering TBE as a travel disease, which should be taken into
account when traveling to endemic areas in Europe in general.
