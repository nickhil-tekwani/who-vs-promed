TP Food Processing, Inc. of Westminster, California, is recalling Lemongrass Satay; and Shrimp Satay (Lot code 2016) because the acidified sauces were not properly produced, making them susceptible to contamination with [spores of] _Clostridium botulinum_. No illnesses, customer complaints, or illnesses have been reported to date.

Below are the product descriptions and photographs:
Product Name / Container Size / Description / Lot Code
TPF Lemongrass Satay / 9 oz / Lemongrass satay, 9 oz hexagon glass jar with red lid / 2016
TPF Shrimp Satay / 6 oz and 9 oz / Shrimp Satay, 6 oz & 9 oz hexagon glass jar with red lid / 2016

The sauces were distributed at supermarkets located in California.

Symptoms of botulism typically begin with blurred or double vision followed by trouble speaking and swallowing, then progress to muscle weakness starting in the upper body and moving downward. Botulism can lead to life-threatening paralysis of breathing muscles requiring support with a breathing machine (ventilator) and intensive care. People experiencing these symptoms who have recently eaten Lemongrass Satay and Shrimp Satay should seek immediate medical attention.

[Satay (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satay), or sate in Indonesian and Malaysian spelling, is a dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce. Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu; the more authentic version uses skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond, although bamboo skewers are often used. These are grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire, then served with various spicy seasonings. Satay can be served in various sauces, however most often they are served in a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce is often called satay sauce. Satay originated in the Indonesian island of Java.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
