[1] Acute Watery Diarrhea - Pakistan (Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa)
Date: Wed 18 Aug 2010
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/fromthefield/217440/0c06f8452491bbc60353adea4e9463b0.htm>


The Disasters Emergency Committee has expressed grave concern
following reports of cholera in Pakistan's Swat Valley. With
floodwaters affecting 1/5th of the country, and stretching for more
than 600 miles, the DEC warned that millions of people are at risk of
potentially deadly water borne diseases.

Disasters Emergency Committee Chief Executive Brendan Gormley said:
"We are extremely concerned by reports of cholera in the Swat valley.
The numbers reportedly affected so far appear to be small, but
cholera causes acute watery diarrhea, which allows it to spread very
quickly in cramped, unhygienic conditions. Aid workers greatly fear
cholera after a disaster because, without treatment, more than half
those infected are likely to die."

UN officials have said there have been 86 000 suspected cases of
acute watery diarrhea reported so far. Acute watery diarrhea is one
of the main symptoms of cholera, although it can also be caused by
other water borne diseases.

[The exact (or even more or less) number of cases of cholera is not
clear. A single case has been confirmed, and this report suggests
some more. Hopefully, the absolute number will stay closer to one
than to 86 000. - Mod.LL]

A cholera outbreak killed 4 people in southern Laos before health
workers could halt the disease, state media reports said Wednesday
[18 Aug 2010]. Acting director of the provincial Health Department,
Chanthavong Xayasena, said the outbreak began on 5 Jul 2010 when 2
families in Darkpokmay village purchased tilapia fish in Sanxay
market to eat and fell sick.

The outbreak killed 4 and made 216 ill in 14 villages in Attapeau,
the country's southernmost province that borders both Viet Nam and Cambodia.

Over 100 people have been treated in an East Java Regency of Jember,
about 150 km southeast of the provincial seat, for severe diarrhea,
which killed 2 people on Thursday [19 Aug 2010].

[4] Dysentery, mud slide related - China (Gansu)

China has been observing a national day of mourning for the more than
1200 people who died after a torrent of mud swept through a town in
the country's remote northwest. An estimated 588 people are still
missing after last weekend's avalanche of mud and rocks, which
leveled an area 5 km long and 300 meters wide.

Health authorities said survivors of the deadly floods and landslides
in Zhouqu faced a grim situation after clinics were damaged and
vaccines ruined. Clean drinking water was a primary concern, with
most local sources knocked out or too polluted to use. State media
reported numerous cases of dysentery, but there were no reports of an
epidemic outbreak.

[5] Cholera - Nepal (Midwestern Region)

The WHO says a cholera outbreak that struck 1400 people in
mid-western Nepal and resulted in 8 deaths, including at least 5
children, is now under control.

The outbreak in Nepalgunj, a city on the border with India, started
around 28 Jul 2010, said Nirmal Kandel, epidemiologist and national
professional officer with WHO. "After about 5 days, the cases started
to decline. It was cholera. It was controlled by 13-14 Aug 2010.
Diarrhea is endemic, and it's now at the endemic level. I cannot say
there are no cases, but there's no outbreak. It's at the normal routine level."

Nepal is nearing the end of its monsoon season, during which time
diarrhea-related illnesses normally spike because of contaminated
water sources.

An outbreak of cholera has killed 222 people in the Cameroonian

said the epidemic broke out on 6 May 2010 in a village in the Far
North, where it was introduced by a trader back from a border market.

According to the minister, the disease is mostly affecting the Far
North, where 167 patients are still in hospital.

To fight against cholera, Tondjo announced the sinking of 250 new
boreholes in the Far North as a matter of urgency.

The death toll in the cholera epidemic which swept through Maiduguri
[capital city of Borno state] and Bauchi like a hurricane 2 weeks ago
has now risen to more than 147. About 1368 others have been hospitalized.

This came just as 67 lives have been lost in Bauchi, with 1742 also
infected in an outbreak that is ravaging several local government
areas in Bauchi State. The epidemic which started in 6 council areas
of Abadam, Dikwa, Kala-Balge, Guzamala and Kukawa communities in
Borno State claimed 50 lives before spreading to Maiduguri and Jere,
where not less than 100 persons contacted the disease. At press time,
the casualty figure had risen to 80.

Vanguard gathered yesterday [16 Aug 2010] that another outbreak of
the epidemic has been reported in some local government areas of
Bauchi State. It was learned that the epidemic had already claimed 67
lives and infected about 1742 persons.

Chairman of the state Primary Health Care Developmental Agency, Dr.
Musa Dabam, who briefed newsmen on the update of the outbreak in the
state, said: "The outbreak has entered its 8th week with a death
percentage of 3.8 percent.
