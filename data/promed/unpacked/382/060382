Anthrax, sheep, Rostov region, Russia
-------------------------------------------
A case [cases?] of anthrax has/have been registered in the Zavetninskiy
district of the Rostov region [The main city of the region is
Rostov-on-Don. - Mod.NP]. This case [the cases?] took place in [the]
agricultural cooperative Phedoseevskoye, where the sheep had fallen ill and
had died. A diagnosis of anthrax has been confirmed after laboratory tests
in a veterinary laboratory.
The dead sheep was/were burnt, and the dangerous zone was disinfected.
Quarantine measures have been applied in the cooperative. Entrance into and
departure from the cooperative are controlled. According to some data, the
sheep in the cooperative was/were ill due to the absence of vaccination
following the previous case of anthrax in the district.
Now classified as a zone of "extreme incident," vaccination of animals has
begun in the area, and 2200 sheep, 416 livestock [presumably cattle] and 75
pigs have been inoculated. Local residents have been put under medical
supervision.
In May 2005, a case of anthrax was registered in the Dubovskiy district of
the Rostov region, where an ill pig was found in Khutor Syrotskiy, an area
farm. The infectious agent was found during routine veterinary analysis of
pork in a slaughterhouse. The tested meat had been brought in by a local
resident planning to sell it at the market. All of the refrigerators at the
slaughterhouse have been sealed, and the products stored in them have been
burned.

[The Rostov Region is in the south of Russia at the mouth of the river Don.
The area of the region comprises 100 800 sq km (as of 2003); the population
of the region is 2 977 500 inhabitants (as of 2003). The capital of the
region is Rostov-on-Don (1 068 300 inhabitants). Khutor Syrotskiy farm, in
the Dubovskiy district, where, in May 2005, the case of anthrax in pork was
registered, almost borders the Zavetninskiy district. - Mod.NP]
[Due to the limitations of translation, it is hard to tell from this report
whether one sheep or a number of sheep were found to be affected. I
strongly suspect the latter, as sheep tend to die in numbers greater than
one, sometimes in significant numbers, before help is sought. As I pointed
out in relation to the previous porcine report, when one has anthrax
reports in pigs, it can be due to contaminated feed or from farmers feeding
the viscera from dead animals to their pigs. I suspect that the true
dimensions of the anthrax outbreaks in the adjoining districts of Dubovskiy
and Zavetninskiy may only be known to the authorities and the communities
involved. - Mod.MHJ]
