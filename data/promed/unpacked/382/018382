We would like to propose our help to the victims of the typhus epidemic in
Sri Lanka. As the French Reference Center for the Diagnosis and Study of
Rickettsioses, we propose to test for free serum specimens of patients for
the presence of antibodies to _Rickettsia typhi_ (the agent of murine
typhus), _Rickettsia prowazekii_ (the agent of epidemic typhus),
_Rickettsia felis_ (the agent of California flea typhus), _Orientia
tsutsugamushi_ (the agent of scrub typhus). This may help establish an
etiologic diagnosis.

[This is a very generous offer. We at ProMED-mail hope that it is possible
to establish the necessary communications and arrangements for shipping the
samples. Anyone who is able to ensure that this message comes to the
attention of Dr. Ajith Amarasingha of Hambantota Base Hospital in Sri Lanka
or other appropriate contact persons is asked to assist. - Mod.ES
