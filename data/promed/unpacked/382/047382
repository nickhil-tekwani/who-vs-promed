A bull from a cattle herd on a ranch near Ted Turner's Flying D has
tested positive and has died from naturally occurring anthrax.

The outbreak began about 3 weeks ago, and, until this week, no cases
of anthrax had been reported outside of Turner's Flying D Ranch.

Additionally the number of bison that have been killed by the
naturally occurring anthrax on Turner's ranch has increased. So far,
257 bison on the Flying D have been killed by the disease. Although
more deaths have been reported, the number of bison deaths per day
has been steadily falling for the past 9 days, officials with the
state Department of Livestock said.

Meanwhile, Gallatin County Commissioners have announced that they
will reopen Spanish Creek Road. Commissioners plan to reopen the
popular road Friday evening [15 Aug 2008]. However, officials warn
that the area will remain under a livestock quarantine. That means
anyone using the road should keep pets inside vehicles and horses
should not be unloaded until travelers reach the US Forest Service
campgrounds.

State veterinarian Marty Zaluski said the area will remain under a
livestock quarantine for 42 days after the last death attributed to
anthrax.

This type of anthrax is naturally occurring and can lie dormant in
the soil for decades before it becomes active under certain weather
conditions like heavy rains followed by drought, officials said.
Zaluski said there is no way of knowing when or where the disease
will pop up. The effort to limit the outbreak has been a cooperation
of a number of agencies and the Flying D Ranch went to extraordinary
measures to get the anthrax contained, said Steve Merritt with the
Department of Livestock.

[It is unfortunate that my 2 predictions are proving correct: that the
disease would spread outside the Flying D ranch (and thus ranchers in
neighbouring should vaccinate their stock PDQ (pretty darned quick)
and that the bison deaths would be around 10 percent.

The good news is that if this in any way mimics the epidemic in Wood
Bison in the Mackenzie Sanctuary in 1993 in the Canadian North West
Territory (NWT), the remaining bison will have been naturally
vaccinated by subclinical infections from the biting flies and so
there should be no cases in 2009. In the Wood Bison we found the
following March that 39/42 sera tested had antibody titres that one
prays for and rarely sees. Thanks to this natural immediate
protection and that the NWT wildlife people managed to burn all but
about 5 carcasses, there have been no more anthrax cases in the
sanctuary in the following 15 years. Regular flights are flown to look
for sick or dead bison during the summer.

A 42-day quarantine is twice what OIE (World Organisation for Animal
Health) recommends but considering the extent of this epidemic and
the levels of contamination involved, it is wise.

I am pleased to announce that the 4th edition of the WHO Anthrax
Guide "Anthrax in humans and animals,"
(<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/AnthraxGuidelines2008/en/index.html>)
has just been released. The editor, Peter Turnbull, and the many
contributors are to be congratulated as it has been a long, rocky
road getting it ready and published. It is an outstanding and
authoritative text. The presently available PDF version is in
English. Versions in other languages will appear in due course. -
