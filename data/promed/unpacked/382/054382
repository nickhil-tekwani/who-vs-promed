This is a long report, with some errors, on the present situation.
Anyone caring to read the whole thing should refer to:
http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/stories/990925/2910470.html
The key points are:
- There have now been seven 7 herds affected with the disease
with 30 cattle dead.
- A total of 30 000 head have been vaccinated.
- The outbreak has generated some stress in the general human
population, along with uncertainty, worry, and bizarre activities
(parents taking children for penicillin shots).
- Some ranchers are concerned that their sale prices will be
affected if it is known that anthrax has been diagnosed in their
herd. Along with this has been a fall off in farmer awareness and
reporting of suspect deaths in recent years leading to the suspicion
of under-observation much less under-reporting. [Hopefully, this
summer will have increased awareness and reporting - MHJ
- The origin is still obscure. One hypothesis is that it might have
been in the bison in the affected area before cattle arrived.
- A joint project, involving Alberta Health, Albert Agriculture,
Canadian Food Inspection Agency and an American investigator,
is being considered to study this disease in southern Alberta.
