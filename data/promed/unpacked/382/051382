Reports from Pune research institute have put an end to speculations that a
deadly Hantavirus was spreading in India. The reports from the Pune
laboratory have showed negative results. The death of one girl from high
fever and severe lung infection and the hospitalization of another person
had sent the health department in Uttarakhand into a tizzy.

Authorities at Mahant Indresh Hospital had claimed that 2 girls -- one from
Dehradun and another from Tehri -- were admitted some days ago with very
high fever and severe infection in their lungs, both symptoms of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS). The patients were later shifted to Himalayan
Institute Hospital at Jollygrant for better treatment after they started
complaining of stomach problems and difficulty in breathing. One of the
girls later died.

Symptoms seen in both the girls strongly indicated that they were infected
by a hantavirus, [that causes] a deadly disease that spreads through rats
and lizards. It could lead to bubonic plague. [see comments in ProMED-mail
archive 20080807.2434. Lizards are not hosts of any known hantavirus, nor
does HPS become bubonic plague, although rats are hosts of this bacterial
disease. - Mod.TY]

Taking note of the death, the health department sent a team of doctors to
the hospital and the Himalayan Institute Hospital on Sunday [17 Aug 2008]
to investigate and take blood samples from the surviving patient. The blood
samples were sent to National Institute of Virology, Pune and the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases in New Delhi for confirmation.

The report has now come and has ruled out presence of the deadly virus.

[Although hantavirus infection has been ruled out in the surviving case,
there is no indication of what the etiological agent of these 2 cases might
be. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information as it
becomes available.
