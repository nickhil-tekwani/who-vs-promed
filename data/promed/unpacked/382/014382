Merced County, Sacramento, California - The California Department of Food
and Agriculture (CDFA), with assistance from the California Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory System (CVDLS), is investigating the deaths of
approximately 100 cows at a Merced County dairy over the past 10 days.
CDFA veterinarians have conducted extensive examinations at the Hibma Dairy
in Turlock this week to determine the exact cause of the deaths. Multiple
samples taken from the dairy have undergone a battery of tests by CVDLS
toxicologists and diagnosticians. All clinical signs indicate the cows
died from exposure to botulism. Furthermore, extensive laboratory testing
has ruled out all other likely diseases and toxicants.

California State Veterinarian Dr. Richard Breitmeyer, CDFA's leading
authority on food safety, has inspected the dairy and has assigned a team
of 20 - 25 veterinarians, laboratory diagnosticians, dairy foods
specialists and livestock inspectors to continue to investigate the matter.
CDFA staff at the dairy are sifting through rain-damaged hay reportedly fed
to the animals. Presently, the hay is the most likely source of the
botulism toxin.
The CDFA has been working closely with a team of experts at the California
Department of Health Services, the United States Food and Drug
Administration and the University of California, Davis, to ensure the
public's safety. All milk products that were distributed underwent
high-heat processing into butter. State and federal officials agree that
this process eliminates any public exposure to botulism.
All samples collected from the dairy are sent to the California Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory System for analysis. The laboratory provides the
state with vital support service for livestock and poultry disease control
and health management. Operating under the University of California, Davis,
School of Veterinary Medicine, the lab is funded by an annual contract
between CDFA and the University.

An outbreak of botulism apparently has killed more than 100 cows at a
Merced County dairy over the past 10 days.
The California Department of Food and Agriculture reported Friday the cows,
at the Hibma Dairy east of Turlock, died over several days. Eight cows died
Friday and at least 20 others appeared to be ill.
A year ago, botulism killed more than 400 cows on the Genasci Brothers
Dairy in Modesto. The outbreak eventually was tracked to a dead cat that
decomposed inside a 1,500-pound bale of hay. State officials determined
botulism grew within the cat's carcass and spilled into the dry hay. The
hay then was mixed and fed to the cows.
The recent deaths still are under investigation by the California
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, according to Food and Agriculture
spokesman Oscar Hidalgo. "We are very sure that it is botulism," he said.
"It is very, very hard to identify. But everything else that it could be
has been eliminated."
He said compacted, rain-damaged hay is suspected to be the source of the
botulism.Botulism grows in an oxygen-free environment which the compacted
hay could provide. "We are trying to figure out the source of the hay and
how long the dairy had it," he said.
It is possible an animal carcass was the cause, Hidalgo said. Several small
bones were found in the hay, he said.
At the time of the Genasci outbreak, Turlock veterinarian Ron Terra said,
"The chances of it happening (botulism poisoning) are almost infinitesimal
out in the open like this, on a dairy. It's the first case I've seen in 15
years of practice."
Hidalgo agreed botulism in dairies is rare. He said the two outbreaks, a
year apart, appear to be a coincidence. He said it is nearly impossible to
determine how many of the more than 600 cows on the dairy ate the hay.
"We are watching the entire herd. We will look at this very carefully over
the next week and a half."
>From the time that state officials believe the cows were exposed to the
poison until the dairy was shut down on Monday, about 18,000 gallons of
milk were shipped from the dairy to processing facilities, Hidalgo said.
That milk was processed into about 700,000 pounds of butter and 3 million
pounds of dried milk.
About half of the butter is in distribution; the rest is being held by the
state. None of the powder was distributed, Hidalgo said.
He said the butter underwent high heat processing that state and federal
scientists agree would destroy any botulism that might be in the milk.
"First of all, there is no scientific evidence botulism is transferred to
the milk (from the infected cow,) he said. "And even if untraceable amounts
are in the milk, the high heat treatment the butter goes through eliminates
any chance for botulism to survive." No milk is leaving the dairy at this
point, he said.
California State Veterinarian Dr. Richard Breitmeyer has inspected the
dairy, and a team of 20 to 25 veterinarians, laboratory diagnosticians,
dairy foods specialists and livestock inspectors continues to investigate,
Hidalgo said.

[The suspect feed was fed to the cattle apparently between May 7-May 9. The
suspect feed being fed may have contained bones believed to be bird bones.
As of 21 May the dairy had lost 110 cows and another 20 (unconfirmed) are
reported to have died over the weekend Bioassays are still pending.
Veterinarians were alerted 14 May when 5 animals died. The California
Department of Food and Agriculture has done an a great job at tracking the
milk products and assuring the safety of the public. - Mod.TG]
