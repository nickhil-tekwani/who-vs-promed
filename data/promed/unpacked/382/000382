The La Paz Departmental Health Services (SEDES) recently detected 3 confirmed cases of a hantavirus [infection], 2 in the Sapecho locality and the other in La Cascada. Both are municipalities in Palos Blancos. Following the report with the departmental health alert, intensification of surveillance in the [affected] areas was done.

In this context, SEDES instructs health personnel at all levels of care, social security units and private establishments in the endemic area, to intensify surveillance for the timely detection of cases and their respective reporting.

Hantavirus causes a serious viral disease. The virus host is the long-tailed mouse. This rodent lives in rural areas, especially in the forested areas such as forests and fields, where the rodents that carry the virus are found.

This disease can be transmitted through the inhalation of excrement matter (feces or urine) and the consumption of food that is contaminated with rodent saliva.

According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), this disease is characterized by the fact that patients present with symptoms of fever, headaches, gastrointestinal effects, respiratory difficulties, and hypotension.

According to data from SEDES, the 1st symptoms of hantavirus [infections] appear between 7 and 42 days after contact with the virus. The degree of mortality reaches up to 60%, since there are no medications to cure this disease.

[These 3 cases of hantavirus infection are not the 1st ones this year (2022). There was a a previous case in the Yungas area of tropical La Paz department in February 2022. The specific circumstances under which these or the previous 2019 or 2020 cases acquired their infections are not mentioned. Presumably, they were in contact with excreta from infected rodent hosts. Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine, and saliva. Sporadic cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur in the Bolivian tropics.

Cases of hantavirus in lowland Bolivia occur sporadically. The specific hantaviruses involved in this or previous cases of hantavirus infection in Bolivia are not given. In the lowland Amazon basin of Bolivia, the hantaviruses that are likely to be in tropical La Paz department and might be involved in this hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case are Laguna Negra virus with its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_, the small vesper mouse (https://www.flickr.com/photos/cdtimm/4367939127/in/photolist-otqNuS-EwTizo-7DYQ8i-278Fjfq-owyXyD-osEZQs), and _C. callosus_, the large vesper mouse (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/calomyscallosus.html), as well as Rio Mamore virus with _C. laucha_ and _Oligoryzomys microtis_, the small-eared pygmy rice rat (https://www.reservacostanera.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/colilargo-menor-oligoryzomys-flavescens2-JGV-e1298896507790.jpg).

However, Seoul hantavirus found in the widely distributed brown rat cannot be excluded without laboratory tests. - Mod.TY
