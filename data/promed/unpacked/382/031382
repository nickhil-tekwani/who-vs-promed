Nutrients & disease: genotype + environment = phenotype
I found both the recent posting concerning secondary copper deficiency in
cattle by M. Hugh-Jones and the Moderator's (CHC) comments provocative. As
most researchers recognize, the reciprocal interaction of genes,
environment and (for humans at least) culture, is complex. For all
animals, diet is subjected to subtle and dramatic environmental and
ecological perturbations--even in the tropics. Especially for those
interested in multi-disciplinary and organismal approaches to field studies
of infectious disease in nonhuman animals and humans alike, it would seem
to me a productive tack to include data on: physiognomy, trace elements in
soils and dietary items, some known secondary compounds, basic nutritional
analyses of diet, as well as habitat structure (how specific habitat
attributes affect, e.g. vector ecology or foraging behavior under differing
phenological and climatic regimes, etc.). See the reviews by Glander
(1994) and Gibbons (1992) for the role of secondary compounds in fertility
and morbidity in nonhuman primates. Just as studies into interactions of
human genetic polymorphisms and disease patterns have proved enlightening
(e.g. see Clark and Kelly, 1993; Hill et al., 1991; Kelly, 1996; Miller,
1995; Singh et al., 1997), investigations into the specific interactions of
trace minerals and health should offer equally fertile ground.
The effects of numerous dietary deficiencies and excesses for trace
elements and bioactive chemicals have been documented. One potentially
productive inquiry is suggested by a recent report that selenium deficiency
may induce rapid mutation to virulence in coxsackievirus B3 (Beck et al.,
1995). For human animals, ethnographic context, settlement patterns and
nutritional data related to local cultural adaptations (e.g. relationships
between dietary taboos, events such as the New Yam festivals in West
Africa, the "malaria season," dietary cyanate, and sickling) can add
another dimension to one's understanding of disease and "environment."
Examples include the interactions of G6PD, dietary cyanate, selenium and
antisickling (reviewed in Katz, 1987) as well as favism, malaria, G6PD, and
the antimalarial effects of isouramil, an oxidant in fava beans (Katz and
Schall, 1986).
Taking a synecological approach to studies of the community ecology of
disease--especially with regard to diet, nutrition and secondary compounds
in plants--is essential to those investigating relationships between
disease and environment. Likewise, since human diet is a cultural as well
as a biological adaptation, a biocultural approach can be fruitful for
those studying the human ecology of infectious disease

[We are indebted to Richard for kindly agreeing to send us this very brief
summary. He had written to me with some thoughts and I asked him to flesh
them out a bit and send it to us for posting. He has certainly done that.
There is little doubt that "disease" is an exceedingly complex term. Most
of the time we look at the most superficial of its aspects. Richard has
given us an opportunity to delve a little more deeply. Perhaps we will all
begin to consider more than simply who?, what?, when?, where?, and why? and
start thinking in terms of "how?" and then, perhaps, "how not?" - Mod.CHC
