I have been on a lot of aeroplanes which are sprayed with passengers
inside. I am less concerned about side-effects or long term effects, which
for sporadic exposure like that are likely to be minimal. I am more
concerned that this is a cosmetic activity which lulls North Americans and
Europeans into the impression that we don't really have to spend serious
money, energy, and research time working with tropical countries to come up
with sustainable solutions to their disease problems.
Is there any published research which demonstrates that this spraying
actually "works"?

In New York City's City Council meeting 12 Oct 1999 regarding the mosquito
spraying [to stop the transmission of West Nile virus it was noted that
pesticide concentrations in the air we breathe are greatly increased when
the pesticides are sprayed in confined spaces. In the meeting,
toxicologist Robert Simon condemned spraying in subway tunnels where there
is limited air volume, and thus probable concentrations of pesticides to be
inhaled far above any proof of safety data for any given pesticide.
[The first ref. above indicates that one could be subjected to even higher
concentrations of pesticides for inhalation when an airplane is sprayed
with passengers inside it. There is a need for immediate review of all
pesticides being sprayed in such confined spaces to assure that there is
sufficient health data for the given pesticide to show it is indeed not
toxic to human health.
This is clearly not the case for the EPA's data on malathion. There is
considerable concern particularly about malathion's teratological impact
upon women in their second trimester of pregnancy, where malathion is
apparently known to produce defects in the fetal gastrointestinal tract.
The use of pesticides is becoming far too extensive for the current level
of submission of teratological and other toxicological data to demonstrate
the necessary safety for human health. Such data have not been made
available to the EPA in the case of malathion. Immediate steps need to be
taken to reign in the use of pesticides in closed spaces and over large
populations when the safety data are inadequate to assure human health.
Malathion in particular should be banned completely.

I write to clarify the position with regard to Australian policy and
practice on disinsection of aircraft.
The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) requires
disinsection of the cabins and holds of incoming aircraft. Disinsection is
done by the airline and may take a number of forms, some of which would not
be apparent to the passenger. A fairly full description of the Australian
procedures is available on the internet at
http://www.aqis.gov.au/docs/border/aaircr.htm
In brief, the airline has the option of using either a quick knock-down
space spray or a residual surface spray before take-off on the last leg of
the journey to Australia. The practice is regularly monitored by AQIS staff
on arrival of the aircraft and is subject to an operational audit.
[Monitored how on arrival? By checking empty spray cans? - Mod.JW
Disinsection of aircraft has been practised in one form or another for a
long time. The 1933 edition of the International Sanitary Convention for
Aerial Navigation included the first published protocol for aircraft
disinsection. The World Health Organization has played an important role
in developing effective and standardised disinsection procedures. The
threats posed by insects which travel on aircraft are difficult to quantify
but the majority of reviews in this country over the last two decades have
supported the continuation of the practice. Target organisms include
mosquitoes, both endemic and exotic species, which are capable of
transmitting diseases, as well as agricultural pests, those which move
around during the flight being more susceptible to the process.
David Sencer [Ref: West Nile-like virus, aircraft spraying (02) above has
questioned the efficacy of the disinsection process (a space spray in his
case) which failed to kill samples of mosquitoes in his pocket or in the
overhead locker. If these mosquitoes were in closed boxes, their survival
is not surprising. If they were in exposed screened containers, they
should have been killed by a space spray but not necessarily by a residual
surface spray.
