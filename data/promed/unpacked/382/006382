A 23-year-old Japanese man who returned from Indonesia was diagnosed
with murine typhus on 10 Apr 2008. This is the 2nd murine typhus case
in a returned traveler from Indonesia in April 2008. He had been in
Bali Island from 13-26 Mar 2008. He stayed at a hotel in Nusa Dua
(13-18 Mar 2008), at a relative's home in Sanur (18-22 Mar 2008), and
at a hotel in Kuta (22-26 Mar 2008). He [was never in] Medewi.

He came to our ER department on 29 Mar 2008 complaining of 5 days of
fever, headache, and arthralgia. The physical examination revealed
only a small erythematous rash on his arm. We suspected dengue fever
and sent a blood sample for the National Institute for Infectious
Diseases (NIID) in Japan to measure serology. Since they had found a
murine typhus case in a returned traveler from Bali, they kindly
performed not only dengue serology, but also PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) analysis of _Rickettsia typhi_ DNA. This PCR assay was
positive. Furthermore, we performed an indirect immunofluorescence
assay (IFA). On 2 Apr 2008, IgM and IgG were negative. Follow-up
titers on 10 Apr 2008 were over 1:256 for IgM and over 1:512 for IgG,
demonstrating acute infection.

On his next follow-up visit, on 10 Apr 2008, [he had completely
recovered]. We scheduled a follow-up visit in a week and will observe
closely without antibiotics. Considering the incubation period of
murine typhus, our case must be an imported one like the case
previously reported. Furthermore, the travel history of both cases
may indicate the possibility of murine typhus endemic around Kuta
beach.
