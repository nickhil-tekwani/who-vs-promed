Ljungan virus associated with intrauterine fetal death in humans (Sweden)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ljungan virus (genus _Parechovirus_, family _Picornaviridae_) has
been shown to cause fetal death and malformations in laboratory mice.
The virus now has been associated with intrauterine fetal deaths in
humans based on both laboratory and epidemiological evidence. This
virus was isolated from one of its wild rodent reservoirs, the bank
vole (_Myodes glareolus_), near the Ljungan River in central Sweden
(1, 2). Ljungan virus also has been identified in wild rodents in the
USA (3, 4). Ljungan virus is related to cardioviruses, picornaviruses
which also have rodents as their main reservoir hosts.

Cardioviruses and their role as potential human pathogens recently
were discussed on ProMED -- see ProMED archive refs. below.

Studies with laboratory mice showed that more than half of the dams
infected with Ljungan virus during pregnancy and then exposed to
stress gave birth to pups that died during the perinatal period (5).
Malformations of the central nervous system, including hydrocephaly
[water on the brain] and anencephaly [lack of brain], were seen in
some of these offspring.

Recent studies in Sweden found Ljungan virus in placenta and tissue
from human cases of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) using both
immunohistochemistry and real time RT-PCR (6, 7). Placentas from
normal pregnancies have been used as controls and found to be Ljungan
virus-negative. An intriguing association between the incidence of
IUFD and cyclic rodent density has been observed. Ljungan virus also
was found in one IUFD case in the United States.

[The genus _Parechovirus_ is one of the 9 genera comprising the
family _Picornaviridae_ and includes 2 species, _Human parechovirus_
and _Ljungan virus_. According to Virus Taxonomy (The Eighth Report
of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses), the human
parechoviruses replicate in the respiratory and gastrointestinal
tracts. Infection is particularly prevalent in young children but is
probably mostly asymptomatic. In addition to respiratory infections
and diarrhea, infections of the central nervous system have been
reported occasionally. The cytopathology may be unusual in including
changes in granularity and chromatin distribution in the nucleus when
viewed by the electron microscope. Isolates of Ljungan virus appear
to infect predominantly rodents. The predicted protein sequences of
parechoviruses are highly divergent, with no protein having a greater
than 30 percent level of identity compared with corresponding
proteins of any other member of the family _Picornaviridae_. The
American and Swedish isolates of Ljungan virus show some divergence.

*****Professor Niklasson has indicated that he is seeking
collaborators to pursue these observations in greater depth. Anyone
with an interest or involvement in the field should contact Professor
Niklasson directly.*****
