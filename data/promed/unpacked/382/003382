FROSTY POD ROT, COCOA - LATIN AMERICA: UPDATE

The frosty pod rot fungus spreading in Latin American cocoa crops
represents a potentially "enormous" threat, according to the
International Cocoa Organization's [ICCO] Laurent Pipitone.

The fungus is affecting the crop in Colombia, Ecuador, the western
part of Venezuela and Peru. It also spread to Central America and
reached Mexico in 2005, Pipitone said.

"While in a global cocoa context the current annual loss from frosty
pod is small, the potential threat presented by the disease is
enormous," he said. The fungus is "more destructive and difficult to
control" than black pod and witches' broom, he added.

The fungus hasn't yet been detected in Brazil. Witches' broom, a
fungus that damages the branches of plants, slashed production by 70
percent over a 10-year period after it emerged in the country's Bahia
region.

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis) of cocoa is caused by
the fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease
originally identified in Ecuador in 1917. It spread rapidly to other
countries in Latin America during the 1970s and reached the northern
boundary of the crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006. While
FPR has not yet been reported from Brazil, it has been detected less
than 50 km from the border to the cocoa growing region of the state of
Para (see ProMED-mail post 20091102.3778). FPR can cause complete loss
of production and is considered a major constraint to cocoa production
in the region.

FPR-affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these
may appear less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods.
Mummies (shriveled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The
fungus produces large quantities of powdery spores giving affected
pods a frosted appearance. It is a specialised pathogen that invades
only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of _Theobroma_
and _Herrania_, which may serve as reservoirs. Conventional control
measures, including phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress
of FPR. Integrated management strategies suited to smallholders and
collaborative resistance breeding programmes are being developed.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of
cocoa and is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production
in Brazil (Bahia) and led to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many
areas. Both pathogens pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas
in Africa and Asia if they are introduced there.

Black pod (BP; also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) causes significant
losses in cocoa crops worldwide. In Africa, the fungus-like pathogens
_Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated with it,
and _P. capsici_ is widespread in Central and South America.
