On 15 Feb 2020, at a press conference held by the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control System, Wu Yuanbin, director of the Department of Social Development and Science & Technology in the Ministry of Science and Technology, said that epidemiological investigations of the virus origins and patterns of progress are very important for the eradication of the outbreak source and to prevent further spread of the outbreak.

As for the 1st item, we already initiated research on the origins and transmission pathways of the novel coronavirus [now called SARS-CoV-2 - Mod.JH]. This item is jointly initiated by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The responsible agencies have put a lot of work into researching the question of the origins and epidemiology of the virus.

Wu Yuanbin said that the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Virology Institute tested 585 environmental and animal samples from the Huanan Seafood Market and many fresh markets in Wuhan, of which 33 were positive for novel coronavirus and 31 of them were from the Western District [of Huanan] where wild animals are sold.

This concentrated data suggests that the outbreak may be related to wildlife trading. For example, the team of the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center tested more than 4800 animal samples collected from pigs, poultry, dogs, and cats in recent years, all of which were negative [see comment].

Based on this result, it can be preliminarily excluded that the new coronavirus originated from poultry and livestock. Previously, the comparison of the genome sequence of the new coronavirus by the Wuhan Virus Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences also showed that bats are most likely to be the natural host of the novel coronavirus.

Through research, the main routes of transmission of new coronavirus are respiratory and contact transmission. Recently, Academician Zhong Nanshan and Academician Li Lanjuan's team respectively detected and isolated the novel coronavirus from the stool of patients with pneumonia [associated with] novel coronavirus. Wu Yuanbin said that despite this, there is no evidence that it can be transmitted through the fecal-oral route or aerosols. As for some new transmission routes, further investigation and research by virological and epidemiological experts are being organized.

Wu Yuanbin said that regarding the South China Agricultural University team's suggestion that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts of the new coronavirus, the relevant scientific research team is being organized to test this hypothesis. Research on the spread of new coronavirus from pangolin to humans is also being stepped up.

[Wu Yuanbin's information about the 4800 animal samples from pigs, poultry, dogs, and cats, collected and tested by the "team of the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center," all "found negative," is new, as is the information about samples from (wild?) animals included among the "environmental" material collected on the Huanan Seafood Market. To interpret this information and assess its significance for COVID-19 in animals, locations and dates of samplings, as well as quantitative data in respect to each species tested, are required. These tests do not make the recommended (20200218.7002276) organised surveillance among companion animals, exposed to SARS-CoV-2, unnecessary.

Because the Huanan market was cleared soon after the outbreak began, determining the source virus in the wild animals from the market became challenging. Although a coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV sampled from a _Rhinolophus affinis_ bat in Yunnan in 2013 has been identified, closely related viruses have not yet been detected in other wildlife species.

A research team, led by Prof. Yi Guan, State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, the University of Hong Kong, and Prof. Yan-Ling Hu, Life Sciences Institute, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, published their results on Thu 13 Feb 2020 (Ref 1). They sought the intermediate animal elsewhere. The following summarised discovery is derived from their abstract:

"Here, we report the identification of 2019-nCoV-related coronaviruses in pangolins (_Manis javanica_) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated CoVs that belong to 2 sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV-related coronaviruses, including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission."

The tested samples were collected August 2017-January 2018 from Malayan pangolins (_Manis javanica_) obtained during anti-smuggling operations by Guangxi Customs. Notably, similar findings were obtained by researchers in Guangzhou in smuggled pangolins intercepted in March 2019.
