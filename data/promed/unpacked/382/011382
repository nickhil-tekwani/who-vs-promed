State and federal authorities are trying to track down a cache of frozen
poultry smuggled into the United States and metro Detroit from areas in
China where avian flu is prevalent, state officials said Tues [11 Jul 2006].
They said consumers probably have eaten some of the meat and should be
concerned but not alarmed. Proper cooking destroys the deadly virus.
The frozen poultry -- geese, ducks and chickens with intestines still
intact -- was purchased by the owner of a warehouse in Troy, which supplies
300 Chinese restaurants and Asian grocery stories throughout southeast
Michigan, state authorities said. They said the owner has disappeared and
is facing possible criminal charges.
Federal officials, who could not be reached for comment, learned of the
problem in early June and alerted state officials around 22 Jun 2006,
Michigan Department of Agriculture officials said.
They said they didn't know whether any carcasses were contaminated with the
virus, which has killed 129 people worldwide since 2003.
Federal officials apparently destroyed birds seized from the warehouse 27
Jun 2006 before the meat could be tested, prompting Michigan officials to
complain.
On 5 and 6 Jul 2006, state and federal officials seized 1600 pounds of meat
from the warehouse. It too was destroyed without testing, prompting
requests from some state officials that all future meat seizures be tested.
It was unclear why agents made 2 seizures at the property.
Although the virus, which lives in the birds' intestines, can survive
indefinitely in frozen poultry, it is killed when meat is thoroughly
cooked. Food preparation surfaces and utensils should be disinfected with
soap or bleach and hands should be washed to prevent the spread of any virus.
"We are treating it seriously and looking to see where the material might
have gone," said Brad Deacon, emergency management coordinator for the
state Agriculture Department.
Deacon said the state obtained a list of the company's customers and is
sending inspectors to each one to collect paperwork and seize potentially
tainted poultry. "Hopefully it will test negative and we can reassure the
public that the food supply is safe and the public health is protected,"
Deacon said.
Chinese-grown poultry is banned in the United States because of fear it
could spread diseases.
"One of the reasons we haven't been public is because it's the USDA's
investigation," Deacon said, referring to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture. "The delicate balance of food safety is trying to let people
know about threats and risks without unduly scaring them."
Deacon said federal officials told him that the owner of the warehouse has
disappeared.
It's unclear when or how the poultry was smuggled into the United States.
Some of it is believed to have been intercepted at a port in New Jersey.
Deacon said some of the poultry that wound up in Michigan had been labeled
as frozen tilapia fish or labeled only in Chinese, apparently to avoid
detection.
The Free Press learned about the search from e-mails that Deacon sent 23
Jun 2006 and Mon [10 Jul 2006] to members of the state's working group on
avian flu. When the Free Press called Deacon, he confirmed that officials
are searching for the poultry.
The e-mails said the state had alerted health officials in Detroit and in
Macomb, Oakland and Wayne counties. The Macomb health department got a
heads-up about possible smuggled meat, said county spokesman Phil Frame.
But Oakland County Executive L. Brooks Patterson and county health
officials said they knew nothing about it.
"Unfortunately, they're keeping the locals in the dark," Patterson said.
Richard Fulton, a Michigan State University professor of avian diseases and
a member of the avian flu working group, cautioned consumers not to overreact.
"It's something to be concerned about, but not to be alarmed about," he
said. "It's very important to know that this virus can be killed by plain
old soap and water, any type of disinfectant or household bleach. If it's
in food that is cooked to the proper temperatures, it will die."
Because of the U.S. ban on Chinese poultry, the U.S. government seized 165
000 pounds of Asian poultry last fall, according to the USDA. No bird flu
virus was found in the prohibited poultry, which included frozen chickens,
ducks, pigeons and poultry parts.

[Illegal international trade in animal products, particularly meat, is a
matter of worldwide concern. On top of its possible origin in infected
farms and in illegal slaughterhouses without veterinary inspection nor
certification, smuggled meat is, most probably, transported in poor
hygienic conditions and without proper refrigeration.
Smuggled meat poses a serious risk to the health of animals and humans.
Avian influenza is just one of the many disease agents which may be
transmitted by such products. Transportation (by sea, air?) of the
slaughtered birds with intestines still intact is extremely unhygienic.
Chinese poultry meat and organs, such as chicken legs, seem to have a
significant demand and attractive prices in receptive markets, probably
mainly for sale in ethnic restaurants. A recent example was a consignment
of poultry meat smuggled from China, which was confiscated in Taiwan in
October 2005 and found contaminated with the H5N1 virus. - Mod.AS]

A warning is out Wednesday night after chickens were found smuggled from
China, a nation that has been hit hard by the bird flu. Officials said they
have found no evidence of contaminated food after a tip from a restaurant
owner near Flint. That tip led authorities to a warehouse south of there in
Oakland County, where they found the poultry smuggled into the US.
State and Federal investigators raided the Tinsway Company in Oakland
County 3 times in the last 5 weeks, confiscating over 2000 pounds of meat
and other improperly labeled food. The US Department of Agriculture
conducted the 1st raid but did not tell state officials for several weeks.
That bothers members of the Oakland County Health Department, who happened
to be taking part in bio-terrorism training Wednesday
24-Hour News 8's sister station in Detroit tried and failed to get an
explanation from company employees. State investigators believe the owner,
who also owns some restaurants, is out of the country. Meanwhile, the
warehouse is still in business. "We are making absolutely sure that we have
appropriate evidence and statutory violations in order to take appropriate
action," said Katherine Fedder of the Michigan Department of Agriculture.
State inspectors are still getting a complete list of the restaurants
supplied by the company but they say a preliminary check shows none of the
meat is turning up in restaurants. Even if it did, the risk to the public
is low. "Making sure that it is cooked thoroughly, that takes care of any
bacteria and any bird flu concerns that might be there," said Fedder.
Investigators think security was breached in New York or New Jersey. State
officials say Michigan consumers may have eaten some of the meat. 24 Hour
News 8 contacted West Michigan Health Departments. They still haven't
released the list to tell us if any restaurants or stores here are affected.

[A Reuters report adds little new to the above, except that the 2000 lbs
poultry shipment was labelled as tilapia.
