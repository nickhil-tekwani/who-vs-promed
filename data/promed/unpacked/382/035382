Ebola virus virus found in Kalimantan's orangutan
-------------------------------------------------
Researchers from Airlangga University's Avian Influenza-zoonosis Research Center in Surabaya, East Java, report that they have detected evidence of Ebola virus in several orangutans in Kalimantan. Researcher Chairil Anwar Nidom told The Jakarta Post on Friday [2 Nov 2012] that 65 serum samples collected from 353 healthy orangutans between December 2005 and December 2006 tested positive for Ebola virus infection.

"The result should be an early warning for us," he said. "In 2006, we collected the samples and froze them because we didn't have an appropriate laboratory to examine them. We examined them last year," he added.
Chairil also said that six of 353 samples tested positive for Marburg virus, a similar virus to Ebola virus that causes a hemorrhagic Fever. Further examination, Chairil said, showed that 60 of 65 Ebola virus [positive] samples were similar to the virus found in Africa. "There were only five samples that had the similarity with [the] Ebola virus found in Asia. The other 60 were similar to the Ebola virus found in Zaire, Sudan, Ivory Coast, and the Bundibugyo district in Uganda," he said. According to Chairil, Ebola virus might still live in some of orangutans' bodies. "All I can say is that Ebola [virus disease] could be a threat to humans living in Indonesia," he said.

The orangutan is only found in Kalimantan and Sumatra. The other great apes: gorilla, chimpanzee and bonobo live in Africa. Chairil and his team said they would continue the research. "We are currently collecting samples from wild boar, which we suspect transmit the virus to orangutans," he said.

[These findings suggest that although filovirus-induced disease is limited to the African content, it is likely that filoviruses are widely distributed, possibly everywhere fruit and fruit-eating bats are abundant. In English, the term Kalimantan refers to the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo, while in Indonesian, the term "Kalimantan" refers to the whole island of Borneo.

Abstract
--------
Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) belong to the family _Filoviridae_ and cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. Despite the discovery of EBOV (Reston ebolavirus) in nonhuman primates and domestic pigs in the Philippines and the serological evidence for its infection of humans and fruit bats, information on the reservoirs and potential amplifying hosts for filoviruses in Asia is lacking.

In this study, serum samples collected from 353 healthy Bornean orang-utans (_Pongo pygmaeus_) in Kalimantan Island, Indonesia, during the period from December 2005 to December 2006 were screened for filovirus-specific IgG antibodies using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant viral surface glycoprotein (GP) antigens derived from multiple species of filoviruses (5 EBOV and 1 MARV species). Here we show that 18.4 percent (65/353) and 1.7 percent (6/353) of the samples were seropositive for EBOV and MARV, respectively, with little cross-reactivity among EBOV and MARV antigens.

In these positive samples, IgG antibodies to viral internal proteins were also detected by immunoblotting. Interestingly, while the specificity for Reston ebolavirus has been recognized as an Asian filovirus, was the highest in only 1.4 percent (5/353) of the serum samples, the majority of EBOV-positive sera showed specificity to Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, or Bundibugyo ebolaviruses, all of which have been found so far only in Africa. These results suggest the existence of multiple species of filoviruses or unknown filovirus-related viruses in Indonesia, some of which are serologically similar to African EBOVs, and transmission of the viruses from yet unidentified reservoir hosts into the orangutan populations. Our findings point to the need for risk assessment and continued surveillance of filovirus infection of human and nonhuman primates, as well as wild and domestic animals, in Asia.

Authors' Discussion
-------------------------
"In this study, we detected filovirus GP-specific IgG antibodies in the orangutan serum samples collected in Indonesia, whereas previous seroepidemiological studies of primates mainly detected antibodies to NP and VP40 antigens in ELISA and/or immunofluorescent tests. As compared with NP or VP40, GP is, in general, considered to induce antibodies more specific or little cross-reactive among filoviruses and other pathogens, thus enabling us to detect filovirus species-specific antibodies. There might be a possibility that our results were due to the cross-reactivity to related known viruses (e.g., paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses) or carbohydrates on the GP molecules. However, since the majority of the positive samples showed significant specificities to GPs of particular filovirus species, it seems unreasonable to assume that all filovirus species have unique counterpart pathogens or sugar chains independently causing nonspecific antibody reactions to the respective filovirus species.

This study suggests the existence of multiple species of filoviruses or unknown filovirus-related viruses in Indonesia, some of which are serologically similar to African ebolaviruses, and also hypothesizes that filoviruses or filovirus-related viruses might be more widely distributed in Asian countries than assumed hitherto. Isolation of the virus will be needed to confirm these results and to understand the ecology of filoviruses in Asia, particularly to answer following questions;
(i) Is there any known filovirus species other than Reston ebolavirus in Asia?
(ii) Are Asian filoviruses comparatively low pathogenic and asymptomatically maintained in the nonhuman primate populations?
(iii) Are the viruses introduced into primates from putative natural reservoir animals?
(iv) Is there a risk of virus transmission to humans through contact with nonhuman primates and/or yet unidentified natural reservoir hosts in Asia?

Hypothetically, filoviruses persist in endemic areas in wild animal species that are resistant or tolerant to the virus and serve as natural reservoirs. Epidemiological information on several EBOV and MARV outbreaks suggests that some species of bats may be natural reservoir animals for filoviruses. Indeed, multiple infectious MARV strains were recently isolated from Egyptian fruit bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_). On the other hand, EBOV has never been isolated from any bat species, although fruit bats (_Hypsignathus monstrosus_, _Epomops franqueti_, and _Myonycteris torquata_) captured in the outbreak areas in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo were found to have small amounts of ZEBOV genomic RNA and virus-specific antibodies. EBOV-specific antibodies were also detected in the fruit bat species _Rousettus aegyptiacus_ and _Rousettus amplexicaudatus_ captured in Africa and the Philippines, respectively, suggesting that these bat species are potential natural reservoirs for EBOV. Indonesia and other Asian countries provide a large habitat for fruit bats, including the Rousettus bats. Thus, it should be clarified whether fruit bats may act as a potential source of filovirus transmission to nonhuman primates and whether these bats continuously maintain EBOV or MARV.

Apes are highly susceptible to filovirus infection and exhibit lethal disease similar to that in humans, so these species have not been considered to be reservoir animals. Indeed, populations of gorillas and chimpanzees have declined markedly as a result of ZEBOV infection in central Africa. However, the relatively high seroprevalence of multiple filovirus species in Indonesian orangutans may suggest asymptomatic or at least nonlethal infection due to their resistance to filoviruses. Indeed, experimental infection of nonhuman primates with ZEBOV, SEBOV, and REBOV showed that the lethality of the viruses seemed to vary depending on the primate species. Alternatively, it can also be hypothesized that there are some unidentified filoviruses and/or filovirus-related viruses that potentially belong to the family _Filoviridae_ but are not highly virulent to primates. This hypothesis may explain the relatively high prevalence of IgG antibodies and low mortality in orangutans. Such viruses may have life cycles distinct from those of highly virulent viruses and could be co-evolved with nonhuman primates. In this hypothesis, it is speculated that filoviruses that are lethal for primates may be maintained in some other animal species or emerge from nonlethal filoviruses persisting in wild primates and/or some other wild animals through mutations. It should be noted that filovirus pathogenicity might be altered with only a few amino acid substitutions during rapid adaptive selection in particular animals, as demonstrated in the process for producing rodent models of EBOV infection.

Because the population density and numbers of orangutans in Indonesia do not seem to be high enough to maintain any virus that causes an acute infection, it seems unlikely that they could serve as reservoir hosts unless filoviruses are somehow able to cause chronic infection in orangutans, as is the case with a persistent infection model of measles virus, other member of the Order _Mononegavirales_ [Negative-stranded RNA viruses with non-segmented genomes]. Instead, they were presumably infected through direct or indirect contact with another animal species _that might be the reservoir and/or amplifying hosts of filoviruses. However, we assume that some species of wild primates could be infected without significant illness and able to serve as carrier or amplifying hosts of filoviruses in some circumstances, as is suggested for other viral zoonotic diseases such as sylvatic yellow fever, chikungunya, and Kyasanur forest disease. Whereas these are vector-borne diseases, possible roles of arthropods in the ecology of filoviruses have also been speculated.

A point to note is the high likelihood of an EBOV and MARV source, including as yet unknown species, in nature. It is possible that the filoviruses include diverse members with different pathogenicity and different perpetuation mechanisms. Indeed, a new filovirus, named Lloviu virus, was recently detected from long-fingered bats (_Miniopterus schreibersii_) in Spain. This insectivorous bat species is widely distributed in Oceania, southern Europe, southern Africa, and southeast Asia. Our findings emphasize the need for a joint risk assessment regarding filovirus infection in Asia at the interface between environment, domestic animals and human populations. Further laboratory and ecological investigations are needed to understand how fruit bats and nonhuman primates may play roles in maintaining filoviruses and potentially introducing them into humans."]
