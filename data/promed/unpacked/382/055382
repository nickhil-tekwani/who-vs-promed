Danish officials are investigating a _Salmonella_ outbreak that has affected more than 20 people with more than half of them admitted to hospitals. Since mid-November 2020, 23 people have been recorded with the same type of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium in the country, according to the Statens Serum Institut (SSI).

Those sick live across Denmark, and there are 13 women and 10 men affected. They are aged 2 to 92 years old, and 12 people have been hospitalized. Nine were from Hovedstaden, 6 in Syddanmark, 4 in Sjaelland, while Midtjylland and Nordjylland both have 2 patients each.

Interviews with those affected have shown they had not been traveling before they became ill, they did not know each other, and they had not participated in joint events. Officials said this suggests the source of infection is a type of food sold throughout the country. The fact that patients have been reported for 4 months also points it being a product with a long shelf life.
