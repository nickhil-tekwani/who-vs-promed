Cutaneous leishmaniasis spreads from Tiberias to Dimona, Israel
------------------------------------------------------
"Rose of Jericho" skin disease has recently spread westward to cities and
towns from Tiberias to Dimona, along the Jordan Valley.The Environmental
Protection Ministry, together with the Health Ministry, will launch a
program to fight the spread of the serious skin disease leishmaniasis, which
has recently spread westward to cities and towns from Tiberias to Dimona,
along the Jordan Valley.

Dubbed "Rose of Jericho," the disease is caused by protozoan parasites that
belong to the genus Leishmania and is transmitted by the bite of female sand
fly that bite infected rodents called rock hyraxes.

The cabinet approved the program this week. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the
most common form of leishmaniasis, while visceral leishmaniasis is a severe
form in which the parasites have migrated to the vital organs. The infection
appears as red sores (hence its nickname) on the skin a few weeks or months
after being bitten by the sand fly that erupt weeks to months after the
person affected is bitten by sand flies. The infection can also damage the
liver and spleen and cause anemia. The sores can cause permanent, ugly scars
if untreated.

The government decided to invest NIS 10 million [2 489 000 US dollars] in the effort, with municipalities and local authorities where the sand flies have spread to receive money to buy fly traps and run public information campaigns to
minimize infection.

Localities that are known to have infected hyraxes will be surrounded with
fences to bar their entry. In the past decade, more than 1650 Israelis from
50 communities have been diagnosed with the disease.

Environmental Protection Minister Gilad Erdan said leishmaniasis affects
children and adults and can leave them with disfigurement and worse.
Infected sandflies have been identified in hot areas around Lake Kinneret
(the Sea of Galilee), on the hills of Judea and Samaria, and in central
Galilee, the Beit She'an Valley, Gush Etzion, Elkana, the Ramat Hanegev and
the Arava.

The money will be spent over three years. Individuals can purchase sand
flies repellants, install screens on windows and wear long, light clothing
to protect the skin from bites.

[An increase in the the number of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis can be caused by an inceased density of the sandfly vector (Phlebotomus), or an increase in the reservoir hosts. One study from the Palestinian territories east of Jerusalem (Orshan L. A sharp increase in the natural abundance of sand flies in Kfar Adummim, Israel. J Vector Ecol. 2011 Mar;36 Suppl 1:S128-31), reported a ten-fold increase in the density obtained by CO2 traps.

An outbreak reported in 2000 - 2003 found that " The maximal incidence rate in the city Tiberias in 2003 was 62.5/100,000 compared to 0-1.5/100,000 in other towns. The cases in Tiberias were concentrated close to the habitats of the rock hyraxes. Sand flies infected with Leishmania tropica were captured around the residence of those affected. Results of polymerase chain reaction were positive for _Leishmania tropica_ in 14 of 15 tested patients (Vinitsky O et al. Geographic and epidemiologic analysis of the cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreak in northern Israel, 2000-2003. Isr Med Assoc J. 2010;12:652-6). Tiberias is in the Northern part of Israel and Dimona in the Negev Dessert and the report implies that the entire eastern part of the country including the Palestinian territories may be experiencing an increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis. - Mod.
