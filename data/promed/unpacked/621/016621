Similar clinical signs (ulcerated mucus membranes and exungulation) have
been reported in captive Asian elephants in Europe infected with poxvirus.
African elephants have been experimentally infected but do not transmit the
virus and are not thought to be susceptible to the SAT group of FMD viruses
through natural transmission.
