[ProMED-mail thanks Catherine O'Connor for drawing our attention to the reports on 9 cases of _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection in domestic cats in Berkshire and Hampshire counties by a single veterinary practice in England during 2013. TB screening of contacts of the infected cats identified 2 cases of active tuberculosis (TB), which were confirmed by molecular typing to be linked to TB in the domestic cats, and 2 cases of latent TB. The latent TB cases were identified by either using the Mantoux tuberculin skin test or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), which measures immune response to antigens found in _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ complex, which includes _M. bovis_, as well as _M. tuberculosis_, _M. africanum_, _M. microti_ and _M. canetti_ (http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Clinical+and+Interpretive/83896). However, the lack of ability to isolate an organism from latent TB prevented confirmation that the 2 cases of latent TB were due to _M. bovis_, or that the _M. bovis_-infected cats were the source of their infection.

1. The following is extracted from, Health Protection Report: _Mycobacterium bovis_ and cat-to-human transmission in the UK. Published on 21 Mar 2014; available at http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/news/default.htm#AAnwszs:

"Between December 2012 and April 2013, a single veterinary practice diagnosed _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection in 9 domestic cats from separate households in Berkshire and Hampshire. _M. bovis_ infection in cats is uncommon in the United Kingdom, and the unusual size of this cluster led to a joint investigation -- involving Thames Valley and Wessex Public Health England (PHE) Centres, the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), and the Department of Gastrointestinal, Emerging and Zoonotic Infections from PHE's Centre of Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control -- to assess the public health implications of this incident.

"Direct transmission of _M. bovis_ from cats to humans has not been reported previously, but as a precaution, tuberculosis (TB) screening was offered to all household and other close contacts of the cats. TB screening using the Mantoux tuberculin skin test, an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood test (QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold In-Tube test) and chest x-ray was organised in liaison with local TB services.

"Of 39 people who were identified as close or household contacts of the infected cats, 24 accepted screening. 2 people who had contact with the same cat were subsequently diagnosed with active TB disease caused by _M. bovis_. One of these had been found to have latent TB on initial screening, but did not have any symptoms at that time. Both are responding to treatment. Molecular analysis carried out by the National Mycobacterium Reference Laboratory and AHVLA determined that isolates from infected cats and the human cases were indistinguishable. In the absence of any other known risk factors for _M. bovis_ infection, transmission of _M. bovis_ from an infected cat is considered to be the likely source of infection for these 2 individuals. Tuberculosis screening also identified latent infection in 2 other contacts of infected cats. However, the lack of active disease prevents confirmation that this was _M. bovis_ infection and therefore, the source of their exposure.

"The absence of reports of confirmed cat-to-human transmission of _M. bovis_ previously led public health practitioners to consider the risk of transmission as negligible. However, an assessment of this incident raised the risk of transmission of _M. bovis_ from cats-to-humans to very low. The precautionary principle suggests that household and close contacts of cats with confirmed _M. bovis_ infection should be assessed and receive public health advice. Guidance on the management of public health consequences of _M. bovis_ infection is being revised to reflect this advice.

"A detailed paper describing this investigation is being prepared for publication in a peer reviewed journal."

2. The following is extracted from, Human Animal Infections and Risk Surveillance (HAIRS) group Qualitative assessment of the risk that cats infected with _Mycobacterium bovis_ present to human health. Published March 2014; available at http://www.hpa.org.uk/webc/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1317140243205:

"Cases of _M. bovis_ infections in cats are generally restricted to bTB [bovine tuberculosis] endemic areas (Gunn-Moore et al, 2011(a); Smith et al, 2009) where both infected cattle and wildlife have the potential to introduce _M. bovis_ into cat populations. Domestic cats are therefore believed to act as "spillover" or "sentinel" hosts of _M. bovis_ in the local cattle and/or wildlife populations.

"Most diagnosed feline _M. bovis_ infections begin as tuberculous skin lesions, that is, non-healing sores or bite wounds on different parts of their bodies. These wounds are thought to be acquired during hunting or territory defence from feline and non-feline animals. It is possible that cats could also be infected through the consumption of _M. bovis_ infected rodents. Primary infections, whether cutaneous, respiratory, or gastrointestinal, can become systemic and lead to weight loss, anorexia, dyspnoea, and coughing and may be fatal (Gunn-More & Shaw, 1997; Gunn-Moore et al, 2011(a)).

"In response to the unusual size and severity of the cluster of feline _M. bovis_ cases in 2013 (described above) it was recommended that TB screening should be offered to all household members and others who had close contact with the infected cats. At the initial screening 3 of 24 people tested positive for latent TB infection (LTBI). No active disease was detected at that time.

"Since the screening was undertaken, 2 clinical cases of _M. bovis_ infection have been detected in human contacts of an infected cat. One case is a previously diagnosed LTBI while the other refused screening at the time of the incident. Molecular typing has determined that both individuals are infected with the same distinct _M. bovis_ strain as observed in the cats. Since this development, TB screening has been re-offered to all human contacts of infected cats who previously refused testing (15 people). Only one person accepted screening (test negative) however at the time of screening being re- offered, all other contacts were reported to be well and not displaying any symptoms indicative of TB.

"The potential for cat-to-human transmission of _M. bovis_ has always been recognised, however this is the first recorded incident of cat-to-human transmission of _M. bovis_. While a common source of infection or human-to-cat transmission of infection cannot be conclusively excluded at this time, the timeline of symptom progression and the lack of any other significant risk factors makes these modes of transmission highly unlikely."

Only 30-35 human cases of _M. bovis_ are diagnosed each year in the UK, and follow up of cases has found the majority acquired their infection overseas or had other risk factors (PHE). Therefore, there is currently no evidence to suggest that transmission of _M. bovis_ from cat to human is anything other than a rare event."

"In summary, the absence of reports of confirmed cat-to-human transmission of _M. bovis_ prior to this incident previously led public health practitioners to consider the risk of transmission as negligible. The detection of 2 clinical cases associated with cat-to-human transmission identified in this cat cluster investigation means that cat-to-human transmission can no longer be viewed as a theoretical risk. However, the lack of previously reported cases even though _M. bovis_ infection in domestic cats in the UK is a known, but sporadic, occurrence means that the risk of transmission to humans is considered to be very low. Based on this assessment, the precautionary principle suggests that household and other close contacts of cats with confirmed _M. bovis_ infection should be assessed and receive public health advice to minimise the human health risk."

3. The following is extracted from, Public Health England (PHE) and Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) press release: Cases of TB in domestic cats and cat-to-human transmission: risk to public very low. Published 27 Mar 2014; available at https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cases-of-tb-in-domestic-cats-and-cat-to-human-transmission-risk-to-public-very-low:

"TB caused by '_M. bovis_' is diagnosed in less than 40 people in the UK each year. The majority of cases are in people over 65 years old, most likely due to reactivation of latent infection acquired many years ago before the introduction of control measures, including the routine pasteurisation of milk. Overall, human TB caused by '_M. bovis_' accounts for less than 1 percent of the total TB cases diagnosed in the UK every year. Those working closely with livestock, or regularly drinking unpasteurised (raw) milk have a greater risk of exposure.

"Information about '_M. bovis_' infection in humans is available on the PHE website http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/Tuberculosis/TBUKSurveillanceData/EnhancedMycobacteriumBovisSurveillance/TBMbovis01countryregion/.

Advice for pet owners about '_M. bovis_' infections in companion animals is available on the AHVLA website. The article, 'An unusual cluster of _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection in cats' will be published in The Veterinary Record today, 27 Mar 2014. Advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens is being provided to vets in a letter to The Veterinary Record. This will include a recommendation that cats diagnosed with a '_Mycobacterium bovis_' infection should be euthanised. This is due to the lack of effective drugs licensed in the UK for treatment of TB in animals and to minimise the risk of infection to other animals or humans. Information about bovine TB is available on the Defra http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/a-z/bovine-tb/ website."

Berkshire is a county in southeast England, located to the west of London http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire. Windsor Castle is located in Berkshire County. Hampshire, a county that borders Berkshire, is on the southern coast of England (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire). The county town of Hampshire is Winchester. A map of counties in England can be found at http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/jo/maps/uktowns.htm. - Mod.ML

Cats can be found in cattle barns. An increase in the incidence of _Mycobacterium bovis_ infection in UK cats has been observed in recent years. Their numbers during the 15 years from 1997 to 2011 were (respectively): 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 2, 6, 13, 14, 15, 18, 26, 23, and 18 (see at http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130315143000/http://www.defra.gov.uk/statistics/files/defra-stats-foodfarm-landuselivestock-tb-other-otherspecies-121102.xls). - Mod.AS

Bovine TB is unfortunately no longer rare in the UK thanks to its resurgence. Therefore both humans and cats will be exposed via unpasteurised milk -- on the affected dairy farm itself and in milk provided to farm workers, neighbours and friends of the owner/manager. This is how I got infected -- yes, I am test positive -- as a kid in the late 1930s. In those days milk was delivered each morning by the farmer's son, as well as to many other households in our village in north Oxfordshire. - Mod MHJ
