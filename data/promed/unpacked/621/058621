[There are fewer chikungunya virus infections being reported so far this year (2020) than in recent years. The reason for the reduction is not clear. The main mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is still abundant in tropical areas, and dengue virus transmission by this vector is still active around the world. - Mod.TY]
