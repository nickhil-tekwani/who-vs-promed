[Out of the 3 countries reporting here, only Japan seems to have the
situation under control.

Thailand has sent in a follow-up report to OIE that has not been posted yet
but can be viewed at <http://www.oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Thailand%20Follow%20up%20Report%20No4.pdf>.
It indicates a reduced number of birds culled -- 337 613 -- but still 18 new
outbreaks in 11 provinces.

In China, since the report filed last week, there were 23 new outbreaks
ranging from Shanghai to Tibet and Guangdong to Hunan. These reports are
invaluable in assessing the situation, and such efforts at transparency are
important steps in controlling the outbreak in Asia. - Mod.PC]
