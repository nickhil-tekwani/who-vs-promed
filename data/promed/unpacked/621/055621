A group of residents of Kikorongo sub-county in Kasese district have
reportedly rejected the government's offer to vaccinate their cattle. The
residents are suspicious that it might be a ploy by the Uganda Wildlife
Authority (UWA) to reduce the number of cattle being grazed from the Queen
Elizabeth National Park (QENP). On Sunday [3 Oct 2010], a resident said:
"Some of us could not allow our animals to be vaccinated when UWA has
always fought hard to make sure that our animals leave the edges of the
park at whatever cost."

A source who preferred anonymity at Kashenyi fishing landing site recalled
that before the vaccination exercise, a resident, who had lost his cattle
to the wild animals, poisoned the meat, which killed many wild animals in
the park.

But according to the Queen Elizabeth National Park chief warden, Tom
Okello, the vaccination exercise against anthrax was being conducted by a
team from the department of entomology in the Ministry of Agriculture.

[Sometimes you can't win for trying. Reading between the lines, one might
assume that anthrax deaths are continuing in the QENP. In Africa, it is a
constant battle between the park game wardens and the bordering villages,
which will move their animals into the park to graze. - Mod.MHJ]

Ugandans living near game parks have been warned against eating meat from
dead animals to avoid contracting anthrax. Anthrax recently hit Queen
Elizabeth National Game Park, killing over 100 hippos and buffalos.

The chairman of the national anthrax taskforce, Dr Nicholas Kauta, says the
people should avoid eating meat from dead animals to ensure anthrax does
not kill human beings.

Addressing people living near Queen Elizabeth National Game Park today [10
Oct 2010], Dr Kauta cautioned them to avoid grazing animals in the national
parks and touching carcasses of dead animals.

[This would reinforce the suspicion of ongoing anthrax cases in and around
the QENP. - Mod.MHJ
