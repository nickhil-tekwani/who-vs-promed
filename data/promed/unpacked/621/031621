In an ideal context, "rabbit fever" would refer to unbridled enthusiasm for hunting hares. But the term usually refers to a serious illness passed to people and pets by hares and rabbits. Earlier this summer [2015], a North Pole man was sickened with tularemia after skinning an infected hare. This does not mark an outbreak in Alaska, but some states in the Lower 48 are seeing multiple cases this year [2015].

This is the 1st human case in Alaska since 2009, although there have been cases of hares diagnosed with the disease in recent years. Tularemia occurs sporadically in Alaska, and this marks the 30th case in 70 years. Interior Alaska accounts for about half the total cases, and Southeast Alaska has seen only 1 case.

Tularemia is an infection caused by the _Francisella tularensis_ bacteria. The disease has been documented for thousands of years under a variety of names, but the tularemia bacterium was identified by American pathologists in 1912 and named for Tulare County, California. It most often kills hares but can also make people, dogs, and cats seriously ill. While it can be fatal if untreated, it is easily cured if diagnosed quickly and the correct antibiotics are prescribed.

The most common signs in people and pets are lethargy with high fever and swollen lymph nodes. Most human infections become apparent after 3 to 5 days.

Hares are the primary host and the disease is spread by ticks. The species of tick known to carry the bacteria prefers to live on hares, but will occasionally bite pets or people. It is most often diagnosed in hares and pets in Interior Alaska between Memorial Day [last Monday of May] and Labor Day [1st Monday in September] because the ticks are active during the summer.

Although tick bites are one possible cause, pets most often get tularemia from mouthing or catching a sick hare.

Interior residents, including trappers, can become infected by handling the hares or from the pet's saliva, even before the pet exhibits signs of illness.

In June 2009, a Fairbanks woman wrestled with her dog to take a dead hare from its mouth. She had a splinter in her right index finger and it became infected with the bacteria. A lesion developed a few days later. Within a week she developed a fever of 104 [deg F; 40 deg C] and she was in and out of the hospital for almost a month. A 2nd case was reported the same month -- also a woman who developed a skin lesion after her dog brought home a dead hare.

If your pet does come in contact with a dead hare, wear gloves or use a plastic bag to take the animal away from the pet and wash your hands thoroughly after handling anything coming out of the pet's mouth.

[Tularemia is caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.

Tularemia is largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere and is not normally found in the tropics or the Southern Hemisphere.

_Francisella tularensis_ subsp. _tularensis_ (type A) is associated with lagomorphs in North America. It is transmitted primarily by ticks and biting flies, and is highly virulent for humans and domestic rabbits.

In addition to vector transmission, tularemia may be spread through contact with infected animals or environmental fomites by inhalation, or by ingestion of the poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water.- Mod.PMB
