A still unidentified disease caused the death of 15 people recently in Camunhandi village, a community in Mulondo, Matala municipality in the Huila province in Angola, as announced by local health authorities.

This situation was announced by the Hula Provincial Health Director, Altino Matias, who heads a team of technicians of the Ministry of Health, that is present starting today [Wed 17 May 2017] in that province, to carry out investigations.

According to the Angola news agency, ANGOP, most of the victims are children, and present with symptoms similar to those of yellow fever.

This is the 1st time that this situation is registered in this locality that is located 200 km [91 mi] east of Lubango city, capital of Huila province.

[Depending on the clinical picture and temporal distribution of cases, the yellow fever hypothesis could be considered. However, it should be ascertained whether, as a result of the recent yellow fever that Angola passed through, the patients were not immunized against the disease. If they were [vaccinated], the hypothesis would become less likely.

As always, without more precise and complete clinical, epidemiological and laboratory it is difficult to pinpoint the most likely hypotheses.
However, meningococcal disease, malaria, typhoid fever, viral haemorrhagic fevers (including ebola [and Lassa fever. - Mod.TY]) should be potentially considered.

Additional information will be welcomed. - Mod.RNA

The yellow fever outbreak referred to, was 1st detected in Angola in December 2015, had caused 965 confirmed cases of yellow fever across the 2 countries, with thousands more cases suspected. The last case detected in Angola was on 23 June 2016. As Mod.RNA mentioned, it would be of interest to know what the yellow fever-like symptoms were in the current undiagnosed outbreak as well as the laboratory and autopsy findings, if autopsies were done. - Mod.TY.

When I first read the original article in Portuguese, it reminded me of the Marburg outbreak in Angola in 2005. I agree that YF might well be a likely diagnosis but if ruled out, I'd highly suspect Marburg... From 2005ProMED report 20050318.0791: "Jose Caetano, a WHO spokesman in Angola, said most of the victims were children with symptoms including fever, vomiting and diarrhea. He said at least 77 of the total of 83 people believed infected had died." - Mod.MPP
