India: More Deaths of Children in Andhra Pradesh; Etiology Still Unresolved
---------------------------------------------------
5 more children succumbed to viral encephalitis during the past 24 hours in
Andhra Pradesh, taking the toll to 153 in the State. 3 deaths were
reported from Mahbubnagar and 2 in Nizamabad district, even as official
sources claimed the disease was on the decline in other endemic
areas. Karimnagar in backward Telangana region has been the worst-affected
district accounting for 48 deaths followed by Warangal (44), Mahaboobnagar
(17), Nizamabad (12), Nalgonda (8), Adilabad (6), and Nellore with (5)
deaths, the sources said. Deaths due to viral encephalitis have also been
reported from Medak, Khammam, Ranga Reddy, Krishna, and Anantapur districts.
While some experts, including the head of a central team of pediatricians,
AK Dutta, identified the outbreak as viral meningo-encephalitis, other
medical experts suspected it to be Japanese Encephalitis or viral measles
encephalitis. The government has taken up several preventive measures in
controlling the spread of the fever by deploying health department staff in
anti-larval and fogging operations in vulnerable areas and also distributed
2 million chlorine tablets, a health department official added.

[ProMED-mail would welcome information on the present status of the
laboratory investigations into the etiology of this outbreak. The mosquito
control measures favoured by the government are not an appropriate response
if the diagnosis of viral meningo-encephalitis by the team of pediatricians
proves to be correct. Viral meningo-encephalitis is associated most
frequently with several different enteroviruses, measles virus, and mumps
virus. - Mod.CP]
