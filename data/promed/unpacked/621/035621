As someone who has investigated egg-associated outbreaks since the
1980s, there is a component that seems not to be transmitted either
by the popular media or even through professional communication. The
risk of getting an egg infected with _Salmonella_ Enteritidis (SE) is
approximately 1 in 20 000.

The reason why we see restaurants now as in previous times being
associated with outbreaks is they tend to pool many dozens of eggs,
thermally abuse them over 41 deg F [5 deg C] increasing the number of
organisms, then they either fail to cook whatever the product is to
155 deg F [68 deg C] or above, or cross-contaminate the raw egg with
ready-to-eat foods.

Clearly, SE is a preventable disease if retail establishments follow
the food code that is in their jurisdiction. Outbreaks of SE have
been attributed in the past to hard-boiled eggs (obviously not boiled
enough), raw egg products in Caesar salads, mousses, and eggnog as
well as in cooked dishes such as quiches, lasagna, Monte Cristo
sandwiches, and the like. The egg industry actually reduced the risk
and many retail establishments eliminated utilizing raw, shell eggs
and went to pasteurized eggs for both raw and fully cooked egg dishes.

It is still unclear whether the "link to feed" or "smoking feed" is
environmental contamination of feed on the farm or actual
contamination of feed as it is made.

Further to your comment on cooking eggs. The following statement is
required on cartons of washed and sanitized shell eggs:
"Safe Handling Instructions: To prevent illness from bacteria: keep
eggs refrigerated, cook eggs until yolks are firm, and cook foods
containing eggs thoroughly."

Thanks for your balanced approach.
