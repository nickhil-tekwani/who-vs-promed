Misinterpretation of Data on Isolation of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus
from Migratory Birds in Siberia
---------------------------------------------------
A recent report in the media indicated that an avian influenza A (H5N1)
virus had been isolated from migrating birds in the Novosibirsk region of
Russia. The report is a misinterpretation of the scientific data.
In a joint avian influenza project in wild birds between laboratories at
the "Vector" State Virology and Biotechnology Institute (Novosibirsk,
Russia), the Ivanovski Institute of Virology (Moscow, Russia) and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (Athens, Georgia), several avian influenza
viruses including H5-type influenza viruses have been isolated from
migratory birds in Russia over the past 4 years. In 2003, an H5 avian
influenza A virus was isolated by the Laboratory for Investigation and
Surveillance of Emerging Zoonotic Diseases (Novosibirsk, Russia) from a
wild mallard duck on lake Chany in the south of Western Siberia and
sequenced to determine relatedness to other H5-type avian influenza A
viruses in Asian poultry. The A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian influenza A virus
was related to, but was not identical to current avian influenza A (H5N1)
viruses circulating in domestic poultry in Asia.
The A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian influenza virus has hemagglutinin sequence
similarity in the 90-95 percent range to the current Asian influenza A
(H5N1) virus, which is similar to sequences of other Eurasian H5-type avian
influenza viruses, including A/duck/Potsdam/1402-6/86 (H5N2) and
A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (H5N1).
These data emphasize the need for continuing surveillance of migratory
birds for avian influenza viruses, and studies of such viruses will
increase our understanding of the ecology of avian influenza viruses,
especially in transfer of such viruses between migratory birds and domestic
poultry. However, the A/mallard/Chany/9/03 avian influenza virus is not the
same virus as the Asian H5N1, and is not evidence of infection and
spreading of the current Asian H5N1 avian influenza virus by migratory
birds outside of the 7 infected Asian countries/regions.
