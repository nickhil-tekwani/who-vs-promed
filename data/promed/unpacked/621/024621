Although the number of new cases and deaths has declined considerably
in mainland China, WHO and Chinese authorities remain concerned about
the situation in some of the remote provinces which lack a
sufficiently strong health infrastructure, including surveillance and
reporting systems and hospital facilities, for responding to the
magnitude of the SARS problem.
As of today, a cumulative total of 8384 probable cases and 770 deaths
has been reported from 29 countries. This represents an increase of
27 new cases and deaths compared with the last report on Sat [31 May
2003]. The new deaths were reported in China (2) and Hong Kong (4).

[A] China - Beijing from the Asia Times 2 Jun 2003
<http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/EF03Ad03.html> [edited]
A community in Beijing has experienced what may prove to be a
localized outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. The outbreak
occurred outside of Beijing's Fifth Ring Road -- the outskirts of the
Chinese capital -- in Beiyuan Gardens, a large residential complex.
Some residents of Beiyuan Gardens sent a letter to Beijing's new
mayor. "The outbreak here is increasingly severe: In Xiuju Garden's
Building 15 alone, there are 3 diagnosed SARS cases as well as one
suspected SARS infection. The most recent case was diagnosed on 27
May 2003, and the infected resident has spent 3 days and 3 nights in
the neighborhood's Laiguangying clinic (this "clinic" was set up in a
ground-floor shop in a residential building, next to a store and a
supermarket that both have a steady flow of customers). At present
we have registered 138 people in the clinic. In addition, Qingyou
Garden's Building 20 also has a confirmed case who died on 8 May
2003. There are also suspected cases in [Qingyou Garden's] buildings
12 and 15. Zihuan Garden Building 9 has one suspected case. Beiyuan
Gardens is a large-scale residential community with about 10 000
residents.

[As of 2 Jun 2003 there have been a cumulative total of 8384 probable
cases of SARS with 770 deaths reported to WHO from 29 countries.
Since the last WHO update (31 May 2003) there have been 27 new
probable cases reported. Noteworthy today is that there were no new
reports of probable cases in mainland China in the past 24 hours.
The 27 cases reported worldwide since 31 May 2003 include 2 from
China (both reported on 1 Jun 2003), 7 from Hong Kong, 10 from
Canada, and 8 from Taiwan. According to the Ontario Ministry of
Health and Long-Term Care website, there were an additional 15
probable cases in the past 24 hours -- it is unclear whether these
are 15 new cases or whether any of these cases had been previously
reported as suspected cases.
The newswire report from China is suggestive of an outbreak in a
housing complex on the outskirts of Beijing. More information on
this observation would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
