INFECTIOUS SALMON ANEMIA - CHILE

Chile's National Fishing Service (SERNAPESCA) has instructed salmon farmers
to kill fish found to be infected with the lethal infectious salmon anemia
(ISA), a highly contagious virus that was recently detected on several fish
farms in Region X.
SERNAPESCA made the announcement early this week [6-10 Aug 2007] as part of
an overall contingency plan aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.
In addition to ordering the immediate slaughter or harvesting of infected
fish, the government agency ordered farmers to disinfect their facilities
and reiterated an earlier ban on transporting fish in and out of the
infected zones.
Last week, laboratories in Chile and Canada confirmed the presence in
Chiloe of ISA. Early reports suggested the disease was detected on just 2
fish farms -- both operated by the Norwegian company Marine Harvest.
SERNAPESCA, however, has since acknowledged the presence of ISA on 2 other
Chiloe fish farms. That announcement was echoed by Marine Harvest CEO Alte
Eide, who told the Norwegian publication Intrafish that the ISA problem is
not limited solely to his company's farms.
So far neither SERNAPESCA nor SalmonChile -- the country's private
producers association -- has revealed which companies own the 2nd pair of
infected fish farms. It's also unclear at this point whether the ISA
outbreak has since spread further still. ISA, not dissimilar to influenza,
is a deadly virus that spreads easily and quickly.
Signs include a paling of the gills, swelling of the liver and spleen, and
internal hemorrhaging. Transmission of the disease has also been associated
with caligus, also known as sea lice. Caligus, a major problem in Chile,
are parasitic crustaceans that attach themselves to fish, creating lesions
that render their hosts susceptible to various diseases, including ISA.
According to Dr Sandra Bravo, a marine biologist from the Chile's
Universidad Austral, the illness was first discovered in 1984 on fish farms
in Norway, the world's leading salmon producing country. In 1996 ISA was
detected in Canada, where it devastated New Brunswick's then-budding farmed
salmon industry. Scotland, another important salmon producing country, has
had problems with the disease as well.
"In 1999 the annual cost of Infectious Salmon Anemia was 11 million US
dollars in Norway and 14 million in Canada. In Scotland, meanwhile, the
total cost of the epidemic was 32 million between 1998 and 1999," Dr. Bravo
explained in an email to the Patagonia Times.
SalmonChile has been careful to downplay the severity of the current
situation, suggesting in a press release that the Chilean strain of the
disease is more benign than ISA elsewhere. The association, nevertheless,
reacted favorably this week to SERNAPESCA's new contingency plan,
describing it as "an adequate form of prevention for this case or any other
health issue of the type that continually affect other food producing sectors."
SalmonChile's casual response aside, others -- environmentalists,
scientists and investors alike -- have reacted with alarm to news of the
ISA outbreak.
"It's worrisome that once again the industry is subject to this type of
thing, in this case a virus," Cristian Gutierrez of the environmental NGO
Oceana told the Patagonia Times.
"We're also surprised by SERNAPESCA's attitude, because when they're faced
with complaints about the (over)use of antibiotics or the use of prohibited
substances, they've always reacted more or less cautiously. But when it's
something that affects the salmon companies' commercial interests,
(SERNAPESCA) reacts immediately with all the resources available to them."
According to Gutierrez, head of Ocean's Salmon Campaign, the ISA outbreak
underlines just how vulnerable Chile's salmon producing regions are. For
starters, diseases like ISA have the potential to spread like wildfire,
particularly in the area around Chiloe, which accounts for 50 per cent of
Chile's entire salmon production. A related problem is how absolutely
dependent the region is on this one single industry. "You have to
understand that in a region where salmon accounts for more than 80 percent
of exports, jobs are the first thing than can be affected by a biological
viral attack of this kind. It's worrisome how this could affect the people,
the workers and the regional economy as a whole," he said.
"The lesson to be learned with this type of emergency is that Chile,
particularly in Regions X and XI, ought to be diversifying its productive
bases in order not to depend so heavily on this one industry."
Also concerned about how the ISA outbreak could affect the regional economy
is the National Confederation of Salmon Industry Workers (CONATRASAL). In a
press release issued Tuesday [7 Aug 2007], CONATRASAL urged SalmonChile and
SERNAPESCA to be more forthcoming with details about the illness,
especially as it could directly affect employment in the region.
"The workers and the industry have recently been the victims of various
fish parasites (namely Caligus) that affect production. For that reason,
thinking that this could cost us our jobs, we're worried," said CONATRASAL
President Javier Ugarte. "It's a very serious situationï¿½ even more so if
there's a possibility of certain companies completely eliminating their
prime material."
Fish farming is huge business in Chile, where last year [2006] producers
exported some 2.2 billion US dollars worth of salmon and trout. The figures
are all the more phenomenal considering that 15 years ago the country's
farmed fish exports were worth just 159 million. Chile is now the world's
second leading salmon producer, just behind Norway.
Together, the 2 countries account for about 90 per cent of market. A
cornerstone of southern Chile's economy, the farmed fish industry is
nevertheless subject to frequent criticism from environmentalists, who
complain that unregulated farming practices are causing major damage to the
country's lakes and coastal waters.

[Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a highly infectious disease of
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_). It has also been found in coho salmon
(_Oncorhynchus kisutch_) in Chile and the Faroe Islands. The cause of ISA
is an enveloped virus most closely related to other orthomyxoviruses.
In the marine environment the virus is transmitted by cohabitation with
infected live salmon or infected biological materials such as animal wastes
or discharges from normal culture operations, slaughter facilities and
contaminated well boats.
Infected fish may transmit the disease weeks before they show apparent
signs of infection. Sea lice of the species _Caligulus elongates_ and
_Lepeophterius salmonis_ may also play an important role as vectors that
can enhance contagion during epidemics.
The pathogen can be transmitted to but has not produced disease in
freshwater brown trout (_Salmo trutta_) and sea trout (_S. trutta_), sea
run brown trout; and rainbow trout (_Onchorhynchys mykiss_) suggesting that
these fish may become carriers and serve as potential reservoirs of infection.
Culture remains the definitive diagnostic method.
Although autologous vaccines against ISAV are used in certain areas, no
product is currently licensed for general use.
The acute nature of the disease and the difficulty in controlling movement
have prompted most regulatory agencies to require slaughter of infected stock.
