BSE Case Confirmed In Alberta
-----------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in a 6-year-old dairy cow from
Alberta. The animal's carcass is under CFIA control, and no part of
it entered the human food or animal feed systems.

The age and location of the infected animal are consistent with
previous cases detected in Canada. This case will not affect Canada's
Controlled Risk country status, as recognized by the World
Organization for Animal Health. This status clearly acknowledges the
effectiveness of Canada's surveillance, risk mitigation and
eradication measures. Based on science, it is not expected that this
case should impact access to any of Canada's current international
markets for cattle and beef.

As Canada progresses toward the eradication of BSE, the periodic
detection of a small number of cases is fully expected. Canada's BSE
surveillance program, which targets the highest risk animals and
regions, continues to benefit from very strong producer
participation. At the same time, Canada's animal and human health
safeguards prevent potentially harmful cattle tissues from entering
the human food and animal feed systems.

An epidemiological investigation directed by international guidelines
is underway to identify the animal's herdmates at the time of birth
and potential pathways by which it might have become infected. Once
completed, a report on the investigation will be publicly released.

[This is the 12th case in Canada. Canada's last case was a 13-year-old
animal. Although the article does not say so, it could be a herdmate
or offspring of the previous, older animal. - Mod.TG]
