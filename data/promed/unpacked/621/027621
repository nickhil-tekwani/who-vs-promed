[1] Response to RFI in Avian influenza (81)
Date: 25 Mar 2017
From: Randall Levings <Randall.L.Levings@aphis.usda.gov> [edited]


Personnel from Veterinary Services, Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA note the request for more information from the moderator of the 3rd posting in Avian influenza (81): USA, poultry, LPAI H7N9, HPAI H7N9, RFI.

The RFI question on ProMED-mail was:
"More information on the type of LPAI virus implicated in these outbreaks in Alabama would be appreciated. The media report says a week earlier that an isolate in a guinea fowl in Jackson county was LPAI H7N9 but does not give the specific type implicated in these 2 outbreaks (in Pickens and Madison counties). - Mod.MPP"

Findings to date in Alabama are as follows:

Jackson County, AL - confirmed H7N9 LPAI
Cullman County, AL - confirmed H7N9 LPAI
Madison County, AL - confirmed H7 LPAI and confirmed H7/presumptive LPAI
Pickens County, AL - confirmed H7N9/presumptive LPAI
Lauderdale County, AL - confirmed H7/presumptive LPAI

The flock status is based upon clinical signs in the flock and available laboratory results.

The reference lab attempts to rapidly determine the HA and NA subtype by PCR, genetic sequence, and/or serology, and the pathotype (e.g. HPAI or LPAI) by genetic sequencing of the HA cleavage site. In cases where a very low amount viral RNA is detected, genetic sequencing is not possible direct from the sample. Further investigation is needed to determine whether birds are at the beginning of infection (e.g. expect more viral RNA in follow up samples), or near the end of infection where an antibody response has been mounted, and the infection is being cleared. Where additional samples are not available, further virus characterization must await virus recovery, which takes time. If no virus is recovered, the status remains at the level of the available information.

[2] Alabama - LPAI

A flock of commercial poultry has tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) at a northern Alabama farm.

The diagnosis was confirmed through Auburn University and the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.

State agriculture officials say the low pathogenic strain of bird flu does not pose a risk to the food supply, and no affected poultry have entered the food chain. The risk of human infection with avian influenza during poultry outbreaks is very low, said State Veterinarian, Dr. Tony Frazier.

"This probably means the flock will have to be de-populated. That determination is being made now," said Daniel Autrey, chief of staff for State Agriculture Commissioner John McMillan.

A "stop movement" order has been in place since 15 Mar 2017, banning all bird exhibitions of any kind until further notice.

The stop movement order reads: "All poultry exhibitions in the State of Alabama are prohibited until this order is lifted by the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries (ADAI). In addition, the concentration, collection, or assembly of poultry of all types, including waterfowl and wild and exotic birds, from one or more premises, at a private or public place, for purposes of sale is prohibited until this order is lifted by ADAI. This includes, but is not limited to, poultry exhibitions or sales at regional and county fairs, festivals, swap meets, exotic sales and live bird markets, flea markets and auctions."

Autrey said the abundance of water fowl in north Alabama requires a vigilant approach to protecting flocks in Alabama's massive poultry industry.

"Water fowl are the carriers. It can spread so quickly, so bio-security has stepped up tremendously," Autrey said. We want to do everything we can to prevent this from spreading. Being low-pathogenic it has not spread widely like what happened in 2015. But it refers to the ability of the virus to produce disease."

"We've not seen any impact on the exports. This industry is huge for Alabama," Autrey said.

The outbreak in Cullman is not the nation's 1st in 2017. Tennessee and Kentucky have both reported bird flu in poultry farms this month [March 2017]. Although no human infection has been confirmed, some are calling it the worst outbreak since 2015.

Frazier also confirmed recently that a flock of chickens at a commercial poultry breeding operation located in Pickens County, and a backyard flock located in Madison County, have both tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza.

The Montgomery Advertiser reported that over 200 000 animals have been euthanized in Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky because of avian flu infection.

[3] Summary - TN, WI, KY
Date: 24 Mar 2017

http://www.lancasterfarming.com/farming/poultry/threat-re-emerges-as-new-avian-flu-cases-reported/article_e9d83ba3-5150-54b4-8d2d-9f8930b199ec.html


Poultry and animal disease experts in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences are urging commercial poultry producers and small-flock owners in Pennsylvania to ramp up their vigilance and biosecurity in the wake of recent outbreaks of avian influenza in several states.

In early March [2017], the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced that a commercial flock of breeder chickens in Tennessee tested positive for highly pathogenic avian flu.

Since then, APHIS has revealed another case of H7N9 virus at a 2nd Tennessee farm, and Alabama agriculture officials announced an outbreak of suspected low-pathogenic avian flu affecting 3 premises in that state.

In addition, low-pathogenic avian flu was reported in a Wisconsin turkey flock and in a Kentucky broiler breeder flock, and routine surveillance has found the presence of low-pathogenic avian flu in wild waterfowl in various states.

The pathogenicity of a virus refers to its ability to produce disease. Some H5 or H7 viruses have the capacity to mutate into "high-path" strains under certain conditions, according to Eva Wallner-Pendleton, senior research associate and avian pathologist in Penn State's Animal Diagnostic Laboratory.

"Low-path AI viruses can go undiagnosed because they often produce very little illness or death," she said. "The time needed to mutate into high-path viruses varies considerably from weeks to months, or it can occur rapidly."

The strains involved in these recent outbreaks have not been shown to infect people and do not raise food-safety issues, she said.

Proper processing, handling and cooking of poultry and eggs will provide protection from viruses and bacteria, including avian influenza.

Infection with North American strains of low-pathogenic avian flu is a common natural occurrence in wild birds, such as ducks and geese, which usually show few or no signs, Wallner-Pendleton explained. "But if these strains get into a poultry flock, they can mutate and become highly pathogenic, causing significant mortality," she said.

Wallner-Pendleton noted that poultry flocks infected with low-pathogenic H5 or H7 avian flu subtypes often will be culled to stop the spread of the virus and to keep it from becoming more virulent.

The recent Tennessee outbreak occurred within the Mississippi flyway, which is one of 4 paths taken by wild birds when migrating in the spring and fall in North America.

During the 2014-15 outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian flu that led to the loss of about 50 million turkeys and laying hens in the Midwest, the Atlantic flyway -- which includes Pennsylvania and connects with the Mississippi flyway -- was the only migratory flyway not affected.

However, with birds co-mingling in warmer climates during the winter and the spring northward migration underway, the poultry industries in Pennsylvania and neighboring states are at heightened risk.

Poultry production in the Keystone State has a farm-gate value of USD 1.4 billion, and the state ranks 4th nationally in egg production and 10th in turkey production. Lancaster County has more laying hens that any other single county in the United States.

"In Tennessee, one of the affected poultry houses was near a pond, which may have attracted wild waterfowl," Wallner-Pendleton said. "In cool, wet weather, bird droppings can contain viable virus for a long time, and the pathogen can be spread to poultry flocks on people's shoes or on vehicle tires and so forth," she said. "So a key biosecurity recommendation is to prevent any contact between waterfowl and domestic poultry and to take steps to ensure that the virus is not introduced into a poultry house on clothing or equipment."

Gregory Martin, Penn State Extension poultry science educator based in Lancaster County, pointed out that the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture recommends that any poultry flocks kept outdoors be brought under cover during waterfowl migration periods.

"State and federal agriculture officials also strongly urge producers to develop an HPAI flock plan and augment it with a comprehensive biosecurity plan," Martin said. "These plans may be required for producers to receive indemnification for any losses resulting from an avian flu outbreak."

To assist producers in developing a biosecurity plan, Martin said that Penn State poultry scientists and veterinarians have developed a plan template that can be customized for various types of flocks. In addition, a video on how to create an HPAI farm plan can be found at http://bit.ly/1IX1yxo.

Since the 2014-15 Midwest avian flu outbreak, Penn State also has played a key role on a state task force that has developed plans for how to prevent, respond to, and recover from any potential outbreak in Pennsylvania.

The task force has addressed topics such as biosecurity, emergency management, depopulation and disposal of infected flocks, issues relevant to small or backyard flocks, and education for youth poultry exhibitors at county fairs and other shows.

Specific recommendations on biosecurity, information on how to recognize the signs of avian flu, and guidance on how to report suspected cases can be found at http://bit.ly/1LY0vU8.

[Most of the counties in Alabama are affected with a low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9. Although not all counties have the strain confirmed, it is likely this strain (Please see Dr. Levings' message in section [1] above). Most of these are commercial flocks, but it is likely that there are some backyard flocks affected as well.

This last summary piece does a nice job of explaining what is going on in some states and the related concerns. - Mod.TG
