[The location of this outbreak is available on the OIE website. It is well worth going to Google Earth and calling up 'La Guajira' to get access to photographs taken in the area. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Colombia can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/2u7r.

The Colombian authorities appear to have this under control and cannot be faulted. Let us hope that it is essentially finished. - Mod.MHJ]
