Despite the ban on mustard oil, the epidemic dropsy outbreak in the Capital
showed no signs of receding. Another death was reported today, taking the
death toll to 47. Panic has spread in the Capital with vanaspati ghee
"Rath" and "Panghat" also being declared unfit for consumption due to
adulteration. The Delhi government has again advised people not to consume
these two brands of vanaspati ghee. The Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said
the Prevention of Food Adulteration Department had tested 20 samples of
"Rath" and "Panghat" out of which 18 had been found to be adulterated. The
Health Minister requested the Union Food Minister to look into the matter
since adulteration in vanaspati ghee would have large-scale ramifications.
Meanwhile, 144 patients have so far registered themselves at the epidemic
dropsy glaucoma cell at the Guru Nanak Eye Centre, the Health Minister said
nine patients were found to be affected with glaucoma and were being given
proper medical care.
