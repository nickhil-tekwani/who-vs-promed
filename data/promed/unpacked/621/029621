The city of Sao Paulo has intensified its vaccination campaign against yellow fever after verifying that a monkey died of the disease, and city authorities also ordered on [Wed 25 Oct 2017] more parks closed since they are suspected of being breeding grounds for mosquitoes that transmit the virus.

The Brazilian Health Ministry announced that it will provide 1.5 million additional doses of vaccine for Sao Paulo, where on [Sat 28 Oct 2017] the health campaign to prevent yellow fever will be redoubled.

At least 86 000 people have been vaccinated so far in the northern zone of Brazil's biggest city where the monkey was found to have died of the virus.

Over the past week [week of Sun15 Oct 2017], 13 parks in the same area have been closed to the public as a preventive measure, the great majority of them since [Mon 23 Oct 2017], although authorities have stated that there is no yellow fever epidemic.

Local residents are lining up these days to get vaccinated, and one of them said that she had gotten worried because of the "great alarm about the fever." "I'm worried because I have other illnesses and so I have to protect myself against yellow fever. I and other neighbors in the northern area are looking urgently for the vaccination sites," she told EFE.

According to estimates by the Sao Paulo Health Secretariat, the plan is to vaccinate at least half a million people as part of the program to cover the public against the disease.

According to the secretariat, if a true epidemic develops, the measures will be revised.

Since [Sat 21 Oct 2017], more than 30 health facilities have been administering vaccine and long lines of people have been waiting at their doors.

The closure of the parks comes just a month after the Health Ministry declared the end of the health emergency caused by the outbreak of yellow fever that affected Brazil's southeast and - between December 2016 and last August [2017] - led to 261 deaths and other 777 verified cases of infection.

Yellow fever causes fever and chills, exhaustion, head and muscular aches.

[On [Thu 19 Oct 2017] the 1st case of death due to yellow fever (YF) in a resident of Itatiba, State of SÃ£o Paulo was reported. (See Yellow fever - Americas (58): Brazil (SP) fatal, conf. 20171024.5401984). An additional human case is under investigation. To date 13 monkeys in the Itatiba area are positive for yellow fever and one of them is still under investigation. Itatiba is 64 km (40 mi) north of Sao Paulo city. The dead monkey that is within the Sao Paulo municipality appears not to be part of the outbreak in Itatiba. There is no date provided for the death of the monkey nor is the species of monkey identified. Presumably the monkey died within recent days, prompting closure of the parks. An active YF vacination program in the Sao Paulo municipality is prudent. It is very likely that the human and monkey cases are from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle and not from the _Aedes aegypti_ urban cycle. An aggressive vaccination of the human population will be the best strategy to prevent spill-over from the sylvan cycle into the urban cycle that could spread very quickly. On [Wed 6 Sep 2017] the Brazil Ministry of Health declared the 9-month YF outbreak over. However, the virus is endemic in many areas of Brazil and neighboring countries, maintained in the sylvan transmission cycle. Eliminating this cycle is not possible with current technology so it should not be surprising that sporadic human cases occur as a result of spill-over from the forest.
