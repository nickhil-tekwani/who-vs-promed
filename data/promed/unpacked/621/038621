Epidemiological summary
-----------------------
- On 26 May 2022, the monkeypox National Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated in response to a risk assessment of the national and global monkeypox situation. The essence of activating the EOC was to enhance the coordination of related preparedness/response activities across the country.

- There were 42 new suspected cases reported in epi week 25, 2022 (20-26 Jun 2022) from 18 states: Lagos (5), Bayelsa (4), Nasarawa (4), Plateau (4), Gombe (3), FCT (3), Adamawa (2), Cross River (2), Delta (2), Ondo (2), Oyo (2), Rivers (2), Taraba (2), Abia (1), Benue (1), Edo (1), Katsina (1), and Kwara (1).

- Out of 42 suspected cases, there were 21 new positive cases in Epi week 25, 2022 from 13 states: Cross River (2), Delta (2), FCT (2), Lagos (2), Nasarawa (2), Plateau (2), Rivers (2), Taraba (2), Abia (1), Adawama (1), Bayelsa (1), Edo (1), and Katsina (1).

- Overall, from 1 Jan to 26 Jun 2022, there have been 204 suspected cases and 62 confirmed cases (44 male, 18 female) from 19 states: Lagos (10), Adamawa (6), Bayelsa (5), Delta (5), Rivers (5), Cross River (4), Edo (4), FCT (4), Plateau (4), Nasarawa (3), Kano (2), Imo (2), Taraba (2), Abia (1), Katsina (1), Niger (1), Oyo (1), Ondo (1), and Ogun (1). One death was recorded in a 40-year-old man with co-morbidity that was receiving immunosuppressive treatment.

- Since the re-emergence of monkeypox in September 2017 to 26 Jun 2022, a total of 716 suspected cases have been reported from 34 states in the country.

- Of these 716 suspected cases, there have been 288 (40.2%) confirmed from 25 states: Rivers (57), Bayelsa (48), Lagos (40), Delta (34), Cross River (18), Edo (14), Imo (10), Akwa Ibom (7), Oyo (7), FCT (10), Plateau (7), Adamawa (6), Enugu (4), Abia (4), Nasarawa (5), Benue (2), Anambra (2), Ekiti (2), Kano (2), Niger (2), Ogun (2), Taraba (2), Ebonyi (1), Ondo (1), and Katsina (1)

- In addition, from September 2017 to 26 Jun 2022, a total of 9 deaths have been recorded (CFR= 3.1%) in 6 states: Lagos (3), Edo (2), Imo (1), Cross River (1), FCT (1), and Rivers (1).

- We have seen an uptick in MPX cases. If the current trajectory continues or is sustained, we may match or exceed the peak number of cases seen in 2017 when MPX re-emerged. However, we believe ongoing efforts to strengthen surveillance, increased awareness from global news headlines and our investments in RCCE [risk communication and community engagement] have also contributed in part or whole to this observed increase in cases. We will continue to monitor the situation even as we sustain ongoing response efforts.

Notes on this report
--------------------
Data source
Information for this disease was case-based data retrieved from the national monkeypox emergency operations centre.

Case definitions
Suspected case
- An acute illness with fever >38.3 deg C [100.4 deg F], intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of the hand

Probable case
- A case that meets the clinical case definition is not laboratory-confirmed but has an epidemiological
link to a confirmed case

Confirmed case
- A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed

Contact
- Any person who has been in direct or indirect contact with a confirmed case since the onset of symptoms, i.e. contact with skin lesions, oral secretions, urine, faeces, vomitus, blood, sexual contact, sharing a common space (anyone who has been in close proximity3 with or without physical contact with a confirmed case)

Calculations
- Case fatality rate (CFR) for this disease is reported for confirmed cases only

[Monkeypox (MPX) cases continue to occur in Nigeria this year (2022). There are 204 suspected cases and 62 confirmed cases, 21 of which occurred in the past epi week 24 (13-19 Jun 2022). The monkeypox virus clearly is endemic in Nigeria. Cases occur sporadically throughout the year and across the country except in the far northeast. The report above does not indicate which of the 2 clades of MPX virus are responsible for the cases. The reported case fatality rate of 3.6% is higher than the usual 1% for the West African clade but lower than the up to 10% for the Central African clade.

This report or previous ones do not indicate if the reported cases are due to person-to-person transmission or to contact with infected wild mammals. As noted earlier, monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of the prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ (giant pouched rat) and _Graphiurus_ (African dormice). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus has been shown to be transmitted between people in Africa, but not readily. - Mod.TY
