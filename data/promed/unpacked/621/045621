This is a news release from the Chief Veterinary Officer of Iceland on the
present status of the this epizotic.
Reykjavík, 18. mars 1998.
INFORMATION REGARDING UNKNOWN DISEASE IN HORSES IN ICELAND.
For the past 4 - 5 weeks an unknown infectious disease has emerged in
horses in Iceland. The first cases occurred in stables near Reykjavik and
soon spread to stables in neighboring towns and to farms in Arnessysla
county east of Reykjavik area. The origin of this disease is as yet
unknown. The first news release on this disease was issued from this
office on the 20th of February urging people to take care in their handling
of horses and all export of horses was stopped on the 22nd of February. On
the 27th of February a regulation was enacted which put a ban on all
transport of horses between stables and farms in the whole of Iceland.
Severe restrictions were also put on the movement of people handling
horses.
So far all cases have been contained to the South West area of Iceland,
with most cases occurring in the closely situated stables in towns, but the
disease has also spread between horse farms in Arnessysla county, in as yet
unexplained manner. So far some 4000 horses are believed to have been
infected out of the estimated 80 000 horses in the country and only 4
deaths can be attributed to this disease.
The disease can be described as being rather mild, non respiratory with
high morbidity and low mortality. Clinical examination reveals high
temperature, even up to more than 42°C which only lasts for about 2 -3
days. Most horses loose their appetite during this period and some signs of
abdominal discomfort can be seen. Three horses have been humanely killed
due to abdominal distress, that did not respond to therapy. No signs of
respiratory illness can be seen. The horses that have been killed have been
autopsied and the most obvious abnormalities have been in the small
intestines, where severe swelling of the mucosa is the predominant feature.
In two horses the kidneys were also swollen. Blood examination revealed
severe leucopenia.
So far investigations here in Iceland and at the State Veterinary
Laboratories in Uppsala in Sweden have failed to reveal the true nature of
this disease. The causative agent is believed to be a virus, but it has
not yet been identified. The first few cases were diagnosed as listeriosis,
which is not uncommon in Iceland during this time of year, but this was
later ruled out. One possible explanation may be that this could be a
virus that is common in horses in Europe, but not clinically manifested
there due to acquired immunity. Once in Iceland this virus could cause
disease in the Icelandic horse, due to the centuries long isolation of the
breed and almost total lack of immunity to viral diseases.
To day most of Iceland is regarded as free of this disease and
precautionary measures to prevent further spread will stay in force, until
more is known about its cause. Export of horses will not be allowed until
it can be certified with total confidence that the exported animals are
free of this disease.

[This may be an old disease in a new, highly susceptible population or it
may be a new agent which has arisen in Iceland. It will be most interesting
to find out the exact nature of the causative agent and identify any risk
factors. We will keep our subscribers informed as the story unfolds. -
