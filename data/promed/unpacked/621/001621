Health officials in Africa are investigating 2 separate outbreaks of unknown illness, a small one in Niger that has killed nearly a third of patients and a larger one in Tanzania in which no deaths have been reported so far, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said today [20 Nov 2013].

In Niger, the outbreak as of the middle of October [2013] had sickened 23 patients in 2 villages in Tera District, located in the country's Tillaberi Region. The area is located in far south western Niger, not far from the Burkina Faso and Mali borders. According to the WHO report, 7 deaths have been reported.

Symptoms included fever, dysphagia, nosebleeds, vomiting, neck pain, submandibular lymphadenopathy, and ulceronecrotic tonsil lesions. However, none of the patients had a pseudomembrane at the back of the throat, which is a hallmark feature of diphtheria. Also, nosebleed, which occurred in 5 patients, isn't a common diphtheria symptom.

Throat swabs from 5 patients were negative for diphtheria, and blood tests from 2 patients were negative for mononucleosis. These tests were done at the Centre for Medical and Health Research (CERMES), a Pasteur Institute lab that operates under Niger's public health ministry.

Given the unusual symptoms, negative lab tests for diphtheria, and high case fatality rate, further investigations are needed to determine the outbreak's scope, source, and risk of further spread, WHO said. The office said that WHO is assisting Niger's health ministry investigators and has deployed an epidemiologist to provide technical support in coordinating the work.

Meanwhile, Tanzania's health ministry is investigating an unknown disease in Kasulu district [Kigoma region], located in the north western part of the country not far from the Burundi border. Since late August [2013], 794 illnesses have been reported, none of them fatal, according to a separate WHO outbreak report.

The main symptoms are fever, headache, vomiting, and abdominal pain, but tests for dengue fever conducted on some of the patients were negative. WHO said more tests are under way to determine the cause of the outbreak and that health officials are weighing several possibilities, including dengue fever, yellow fever, and hepatitis A or E.

In response to the outbreak, health officials have intensified health education about environmental hygiene and sanitation and have strengthened surveillance and lab analysis of samples, according to the report.

Sharon Sanders, editor-in-chief of the infectious disease message board FluTrackers, told CIDRAP News that the group's volunteers follow developments in the 2 countries, but added that Africa is a challenging area to monitor, because the news coming out of the region is sparse. She said malaria and cholera seem to be chronic in the area over the past months, and health officials in Niger recently detected the country's 1st diphtheria cases in 7 years.

She said it's not unusual to see news stories about "unknown" diseases appear in the African media, which are usually resolved in a few weeks after global health groups arrive to assist with testing. However, Sanders said it is unusual for a WHO division to report an unknown disease outbreak.

"We are going to carefully watch this," Sanders said, adding that reports of nasal bleeding in the Niger outbreak patients are worrying and that she would like to know if bleeding is a feature in any of the Tanzanian cases.

[The information provided for the Niger outbreak is general, and does not provide enough specific information to suggest which etiological agent may be responsible for these cases. However, one possibility is Lassa fever virus, which is endemic in neighboring Nigeria. The reservoir host for that virus is the multimammate mouse, _Mastomys_, 2 or more species of which are present in the Tillaberi region in south western Niger (http://maps.iucnredlist.org/map.html?id=12868) along the Nigeria border. The USA CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm) lists Lassa fever clinical signs as, "fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult." No mention of tonsil lesions similar to those in the Niger cases is made in the CDC description. Other possibilities include Marburg and Ebola virus infection, although no mention is made of a maculopapular rash that is common with infections by these viruses. If these are yellow fever cases, one would think that symptoms of that disease are specific enough to raise suspicions of that etiology. A confirmed case of yellow fever occurred in Niger in April 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20130609.1762775) and Niger health authorities should be familiar with that disease.

Although dengue has been ruled out in the Tanzania febrile disease outbreak, no mention is made about testing for chikungunya virus infections. However, no mention is made of acute and persistent arthralgia that is characteristic of infections with that virus. There are many other infectious agents that can cause the symptoms seen in the Tanzania cases.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further information about these 2 outbreaks, and especially laboratory results, as they become available.
