Ngamiland [North West district] has recorded an alarming number of 618 cases of malaria and 6 deaths during the past 6 months.

Okavango District [Ngamiland] Health Management Team [DHMT] received 536 cases and 4 deaths while Ngami DHMT recorded 82 cases with 2 deaths.

When officially opening the North West District Council, the Council Chairman Lathang Molonda appealed to members of the house to participate in mobilising the community to cooperate during spraying seasons as the exercise can immensely contribute in reducing the rising cases.

"You will agree with me that the acceptance of indoor residual spray (IRS) is a major factor which is significantly influenced by mobilising the community."

He said the number might have been expedited by high, prolonged rains that led to the stagnation of water pools in surroundings.

"We haven't compiled the ages of those who were affected but what we must strive on is reducing the number of cases," replied Molonda when questioned by this publication.

He, however, encouraged communities to clean both their residential areas and surroundings at all times.

On the issue of Ebola virus disease [EVD], Molonda pointed out that they have not received any cases but that the DHMT remains vigilant and alert to the threat and have put measures in place to quarantine and manage any cases or suspected cases of patients with the [EVD].

[In the Northern part of Botswana (see map in the 2013 World Malaria Report at http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2013/wmr2013_country_profiles.pdf?ua=1) the annual incidence rate is 0.1 -- 1 case per 1000 population. Hospital admission has declined from over 1000 in 2006 to less than 100 in 2012 (WMR2013). Thus, the present outbreak seems to be out of the ordinary background transmission. - Mod.EP
