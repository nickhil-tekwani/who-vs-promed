Cough or a fever? Just 2 signs your dog may have valley fever.

One in 4 dogs will get valley fever in their lifetime and there is currently no vaccine.

[One family's] 3-year-old dog was just diagnosed with valley fever. [One of the owner's] says her dog doesn't go to dog parks or dig in the backyard, but enjoys riding in the car.

"She loves to have her head out the window with the wind blowing in her face and in fact the day we took them for shots that is exactly what she was doing and we were driving by all this construction that is going on down here," she said.

The Ina Road construction project is near their home. [The owner] says she always sees dust flying up and thinks her dog could have breathed it in.

"As far as valley fever cases I will see 3 or 4 new ones every day and we are treating hundreds of them," said Dr. Richard Livingston with Acoma Animal Clinic. Dr. Livingston says Tucson has a bad caseload of the disease.

"Valley fever is called a deep fungus," he said. "It lives on the surface of the soil, monsoon rains it sporulates on the soil and then when the winds come along whip those spores into the air and we all inhale it." He says common signs include a cough, fever, weight loss and even seizures. Monthly treatment can cost up to USD 60 and that doesn't include doctor checkups every 3 to 6 months.

The TV station 9 on your side asked the Arizona Department of Transportation about the construction dust and a spokesperson said that crews are constantly watering the Ina site to keep dust down. Also, on windier days more water is applied.

Dr. Livingston says there is no way to prevent a dog from getting valley fever... if they are outside, they're exposed.

"What I have learned from this, from our wind on these windy days and near all this construction maybe keep them inside as much as you can," she said.

The University of Arizona is in the process of creating a valley fever vaccine for dogs. Researchers say it is still being tested in the lab and about 4 years away from field testing.

[Valley Fever has many names, some of which may be local to your area. The disease caused by a fungus known as _Coccidiodes immitis_ . Although the proper name for this disease is "coccidioidomycosis", it is most often called Valley Fever, "California disease", "Desert rheumatism", or "San Joaquin Valley Fever"

The fungus thrives in the soil. It has adapted to survive in desert climates and is prevalent in certain parts of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, northwestern Mexico and parts of Central and South America. Infection rates vary greatly by county, and not all the factors that contribute to the rate of infection in an area have been determined. Valley Fever tends to occur during certain seasons.

At the current time, Valley Fever is reaching epidemic proportions in Arizona. In this area, the highest prevalence of infections occurs during June and July and from October through November. Although it is recognized as a seasonal disease, (occurring during certain seasons), the weather patterns will influence the specific dates of any season. Is the year more wet or more dry? Are the winds higher? Are the temperatures higher? Even a fungus has a range that it can thrive within, so multiple weather conditions will affect the organism as well as the time of year it is most active.

Like many fungi, _Coccidioides immitis_ has a complex life cycle. It has 2 completely different forms, depending on whether it is in the environment or has entered a host animal. When it is in the environment, it exists as a mold. During dry spells, the mold goes dormant in the soil, and can remain dormant for prolonged periods of time. Once the rains come, the fungus grows and produces long filaments of mold that contain infectious spores. The tiny spores readily become airborne when the soil is disturbed by winds or by construction, farming, or digging. If the spores are inhaled, they transform into a yeast-like organism that infects the lungs.

The disease is contracted by inhaling fungal spores. The disease cannot be directly transmitted from person to person, nor can it be transmitted from people to animals. In other words, an animal with Valley Fever is not contagious to other pets or your family members

This disease is common in humans, and has been isolated in dogs, cattle, horses, deer, elk, mules, llamas, apes, monkeys, kangaroos, wallabies, tigers, bears, badgers, otters, fish and marine mammals. Dogs appear to be very susceptible to infections with Valley Fever, probably because they sniff the ground and dig in the dirt, potentially inhaling large numbers of spores at a time.

Once the spores are breathed into the lungs, they develop into larger structures called 'spherules'. In a healthy adult dog, the dog's immune system will wall off the organisms in the spherules and there will be no further problems. In these cases, the signs of disease are usually very mild, and often the dog does not even become visibly ill.

But in dogs that have a weak immune system because of age or underlying illness, serious illness can develop. Thus, both very young puppies and old dogs are more susceptible to illness from Valley Fever. In these patients, the spherules continue to grow and eventually burst, releasing more infectious organisms to spread throughout the lungs or to other organs in the body where the cycle repeats itself over and over.

Valley Fever can take 2 main forms of disease in the dog, the Primary Disease and the Disseminated Disease.

The Primary Disease is limited to the lungs. Sign of Primary Valley Fever include a harsh dry cough, a fever, a lack of appetite, and lethargy or depression. These signs usually occur about 3 weeks after infection.

In the Disseminated Disease the fungus has disseminated or spread to other parts of the body. The bones and joints are most commonly infected, and lameness is the most common sign. The joints may become swollen and painful. Other signs are non-specific and may include lack of appetite, lethargy or depression, a persistent fever, and weight loss. In rare cases, the fungus invades the brain, resulting in seizure activity.

There are a number of diagnostic tests available to aid the veterinarian regarding a diagnosis. Thee is a titer test for this disease. Radiographs (x-rays) of the check may demonstrate fungal lesions in the lungs and either rule in or out other possibilities if lameness is involved in the syndrome.

As this disease is not in every state, an accurate diagnosis depends upon the owner alerting the veterinarian to any travel in the areas known to be affected by this disease.

Dogs that develop Valley Fever require lengthy treatment with antifungal medications. The duration of treatment will depend on the severity of infection. In many cases treatment will be required for 6-12 months. If the fungus has invaded the nervous system, the dog may require antifungal medication for life.

There are a number of antifungal medications that are effective against the disease. The most commonly prescribed medications are ketoconazole, itraconazole, and fluconazole. Although the treatment is prolonged, the dog usually begins to feel better within one-2 weeks after the treatment begins. However these antifungal drugs can be hard on the liver and kidneys so periodic blood tests to see how these organs are performing is necessary.

The most common side effects of these medications include vomiting and loss of appetite. Since they can be toxic to the liver, your veterinarian will recommend periodic blood tests to monitor liver function.

With a timely diagnosis and treatment, most animals recover from this disease, however an animal can die from this disease. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are the most helpful.
