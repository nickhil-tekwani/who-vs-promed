Ref: Shojima T, Yoshikawa R, Hoshino S et al: Identification of a Novel Subgroup of Koala Retrovirus from Koalas in Japanese Zoos. J Virol 2013; 87(14); doi: 10.1128/JVI.01385-13
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We identified a new subgroup of koala retrovirus (KoRV), named KoRV-J, which utilizes thiamine transport protein 1 as a receptor instead of the Pit-1 receptor used by KoRV (KoRV-A). By subgroup specific PCR, KoRV-J and KoRV-A were detected in 67.5 and 100 percent of koalas originating from northern koalas, respectively. Altogether, our results indicate that the invasion of the koala population by KoRV-J may have occurred more recently than by KoRV-A.

The virus is one of 2 the study named KoRV-A and KoRV-B. These were formerly thought to be just one virus, called KoRV, for koala endogenous retrovirus. KoRV-B is passed along from mother to cub by infection. KoRV-A is passed down through the genome.

[Before the discovery of the koala endogenous retrovirus (KoRV), mammalian endogenous retroviruses were thought not to produce infectious particles. KoRV retains its ability to form virus particles capable of 'de novo' infection transmission. KoRV also represents an example that endogenous retroviruses may have evolved relatively recently.

Recent investigations in koalas kept in zoos revealed the existence of 3 subtypes of KoRV, KoRV-A, KoRV-B, and the one reported here, KoRV-J. Different subtypes have different traits in their transmission and pathogenicity. It would be important to plan studies that focus on the ecoepidemiology and significance of these pathogens in the wild. - Mod.PMB]
