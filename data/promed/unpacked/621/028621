UK: A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like strains circulating in the community
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinical indicators of influenza activity continue to rise in England and
Northern Ireland and are now above baseline levels in Scotland. Rates in
Wales remain stable and below the baseline level. Sporadic detections of
influenza A viruses continue to be reported from all countries in the
United Kingdom (UK). The rate for influenza-like illness in England is
highest in the north and in the 0 to 4 year age group (information
collected by the Royal College General Practitioners*). In England young
children make up the majority of infections reported from hospital sources,
while most detections from virological surveillance in general
practitioners' surgeries are in the 15 to 44 year age group. Current
information suggests that the UK is moving into the influenza season.
3 sudden deaths in young children aged between 2 and 8 years in central and
southern Scotland have been attributed to influenza A infection since early
September. In England sudden deaths with confirmed influenza A infection in
2 children aged 18 months and 11 years were reported from the same hospital
in central England in October. Characterization of the influenza A viruses
from 2 of the deaths in Scotland and also the 2 in England have confirmed
the strain as A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like. No underlying risk factors
have been identified so far for any of the reported deaths in Scotland or
England.
Young children are particularly susceptible to influenza, because most have
little or no history of exposure to influenza viruses and have limited
protective immunity. The relatively low levels of influenza activity that
have been seen in the UK in recent years may also have contributed to this.
In a small percentage of children, particularly the very young, illness may
be severe.
(* Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) weekly returns service: A
weekly reporting service from sentinel general practitioners' surgeries
distributed throughout England who record morbidity data from every
consultation as the working diagnosis made by the general practitioner.
Similar schemes are run in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. All rates
are reported per 100 000 of the general population. Rates for
influenza-like illness, acute bronchitis, and total respiratory disease are
of particular relevance.)

UK: A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like Virus Responsible for Deaths of Five
Children
---------------------------------------------------
A strain of [influenza A virus] that has caused widespread illness in
Australia has arrived in Britain, according to the Health Protection Agency
(HPA). The [A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like] strain has already claimed the
lives of at least 4 of the 5 children who have died from influenza so far.
While children die from influenza every year, these deaths are earlier than
usual, indicating that a larger outbreak is possible. This strain was
recently responsible for Australia's biggest influenza outbreak for 5
years. The HPA said it was too early to predict how it would affect Britain
but urged the over 65s and "at risk" groups to get vaccinated against
influenza. Britain has seen unusually low rates of influenza for each of
the past 3 winters. The latest figures from the HPA suggest influenza cases
are rising to what is considered normal seasonal levels.
In recent years, most cases of influenza in Britain have been caused by an
[A/Panama/2007/99-like] strain of virus. The current influenza vaccine is
designed to protect against this strain. However, the HPA said the main
strain circulating this year is the [A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like] strain
and people are becoming infected earlier than usual. "For the last 3 years,
we have seen very low levels of influenza in the UK, but influenza activity
has started earlier than normal this year, so we are expecting to see more
cases," said Dr John Watson, a respiratory expert at the HPA.
Laboratory testing so far this year shows that the main strain circulating
is a [A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like] strain. Dr Watson said children and
adolescents have been most affected so far. There have been 2 deaths in
England and 3 in Scotland. The Scottish Centre for Infection &
Environmental Health (SCIEH) said tests had also shown that the same strain
was responsible for its 3 deaths. "Unfortunately there have been 3 deaths
in Scotland over the last 2 months in children between the ages of 2 and 8
years," said Dr Jim McMenamin, a consultant epidemiologist at SCIEH. These
deaths are unusual in that they are earlier than normal. However, over
winter around 3 children die from respiratory illness in England each week.
Dr Watson urged the over 65s to get vaccinated against influenza. He also
suggested that children over 6 months who fall into "at risk" groups should
also receive the jab. "The current influenza vaccine contains the
[A/Panama/2007/99] strain of virus and is considered to offer some
protection against [A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2)-like] strains and good
protection against other strains that may also circulate," he said. "When
influenza virus strains change over time, they are more likely to affect
the young, who will have less immunity to them. For this reason, it is
especially important for children over 6 months of age who fall into the
at-risk groups to be vaccinated." Those in at-risk groups include those
with severe asthma, people with chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or with
lowered immunity due to any disease or treatment such as steroid medication
or cancer treatment.
