--------------------------------------------------
In this study, SBV sequence variability was characterised from the central nervous systems of 2 stillborn lambs in a naturally infected herd. A hypervariable region was detected in the N-terminal region of SBV Gc glycoprotein through the sequencing and analysis of the 2 full length genomes representative of intra-herd SBV dissemination. In vitro growth assays coupled with full length genome sequencing were performed on the 2 isolates after successive cellular passages showing an in vitro adaptation of SBV and mutation accumulation inside the hypervariable region in the absence of immune selective pressure.

[The following concluding remarks were included in the Belgian paper above:

"Analysis of 2 SBV sheep isolates obtained from the same herd in Belgium revealed a high level of variability of this newly identified virus. One salient finding was that the SBV Gc protein contained a N-terminal domain that accumulated mutations in the natural course of SBV infection within a sheep herd and during BHK-21 adaptation.

"This result suggests that the variability identified in this domain may support different biological processes such as immune evasion mechanism in the natural context of infection and/or adaptation of the cell tropism and cell replication properties both in vivo and in vitro.

"Given that SBV re-emergence occurs even in regions with a high seroprevalence [see reference below], it will be interesting to investigate the impact of these alternate functions as driving force for SBV evolution."

-------------------------------------------
We report the recurrence of Schmallenberg virus [SBV] infection in adult cattle, sheep, and a goat in Germany in 2012. Veterinary authorities at the county or town level report the animal holdings where laboratory-confirmed SBV infections are found to the central national database for notifiable animal diseases, which is maintained by the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut; the reports are made online. This database was analyzed for reported holdings with SBV infections that had been detected in adult animals from June 2001 through 31 Oct 2012, and confirmed by PCR or virus isolation. In total, 82 infections were reported in adult cattle, 8 in adult sheep, and 1 in a goat.

45 of the cattle holdings and 4 sheep holdings submitted samples for testing because the affected animals had shown clinical signs. One case was detected in a sheep flock, and 5 cases were detected in cattle in trade examinations. For the remaining cases, no specific reason for testing was reported.

Although some cases were reported from the region in western and northern Germany where the epidemic had its center in 2011, several new infections occurred in regions in southern Germany where no cases or only few cases of SBV virus infection had been detected before. This phenomenon may have occurred because of a high level of protective immunity at the population level in the region, although a substantial proportion of the animals at the margin of the affected area remained susceptible.

SBV that has overwintered in these areas may thus be transmitted to naive animals and has apparently spread to regions in southern Germany that were not affected or were less affected by the previous SBV epidemic. SBV could also be introduced into neighboring countries through infected arthropods.

SBV infection is often mild or clinically inapparent in adult animals and leads only to a short viremic period of about 4-5 days. Because a substantial proportion of new infections in adult animals are likely not recognized, the new cases reported in Germany in 2012 probably represent only the so-called tip of the iceberg. Nevertheless, PCR analysis to detect SBV in samples from animals with clinical signs is a valuable method for identifying 1st cases in areas where SBV infections have not previously been found.

[In addition to Germany and Belgium, SBV has continued its circulation during 2012 in other countries which had initially been infected during 2011, such as the Netherlands and France.

It is of particular importance to investigate and be informed if animals and farms which had been infected during 2011, have remained unaffected (naturally protected) during 2012. - Mod.AS
