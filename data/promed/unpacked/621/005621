[OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database), always
provides a map with the disease report. This map is well worth
looking at because zooming in will allow you to see that the
locations near the peninsula that contains Dakar, although there are
some indications from previous reports that the setting for these
outbreaks is more rural.
The following website provides an excellent picture and identifies
the location of the outbreak at Pikine
<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701511956/Dakar.html>.
Although this report indicates that African horse sickness virus
(AHSV) serotype 9 is endemic in Senegal, this outbreak is caused by
AHSV serotype 2, which has also been reported recently in Nigeria.
Intensive outbreak investigation in Nigeria at the University of
Ibadan and corresponding sequencing studies at Onderstepoort OIE
reference laboratory for AHS to identify the presence of serotype 2
rather than serotype 9, provide important steps in understanding the
epidemiology of this disease and highlight the synergistic power that
good reference laboratories can play.
Now, if only a seroprevalence study in the appropriate locations in
West Africa could be undertaken, our understanding would move along
at an even greater pace. The importance of greater understanding is
highlighted by the 100 percent case fatality rate reported here. - Mod.PC]
