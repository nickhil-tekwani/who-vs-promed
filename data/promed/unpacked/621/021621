[The October 13, 2000 edition of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
(MMWR) contains a detailed account of the "Outbreak of Rift Valley Fever -
Saudi Arabia, August-October, 2000", up to the 24 hours prior to the above
Arab News Report The MMWR Report includes a histogram of the number and
date of onset of suspected cases from the earliest suspected case on 27 Aug
2000, and a map giving the location of suspected cases. Confirmation of the
diagnosis of Rift Valley fever was obtained on 15 Sep 2000 from results of
ELISA (antigen detection and IgM), PCR, virus isolation and
immunochemistry. As of 9 Oct 2000, 316 patients had been diagnosed with
Rift Valley fever (approximately 20% of whom have died). 78% of suspected
cases were adult males and 5% were children. 80% were Saudi citizens and
the remainder Yemeni citizens. The suspected severe cases resided in or had
visited the flood plains or wadis that emanate from the foothills of the
Sarawat mountains and extend south of Jeddah to the border with the Yemen.
96% of cases originated from the southern costal province of Jizan
(population 860 000) and adjacent regions. The full Report, which includes
a description of the epidemiology of Rift Valley fever and the screening
case definition can be accessed at
