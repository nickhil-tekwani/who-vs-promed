The state [West Bengal] animal husbandry department is probing a suspected anthrax outbreak in North 24 Parganas' Habra-II block after 22 buffaloes died in Guma Ghoshpara in the last one week.

North 24 Parganas district veterinary officer Gautam Kumar Nandi on [Mon 14 Aug 2017] led a team of veterinary experts to the affected zone to not only collect blood samples of the affected cattle but also apply anti-anthrax vaccine as a precautionary measure. He said: "The affected cattle are showing symptoms which indicate anthrax infections. This, however, can only be confirmed after we get the blood reports."

Locals, who fear a possible human infection, are also panicked. North 24 Parganas CMOH Pralay Acharya said: "We are keeping a close watch on the situation. The animal husbandry department is taking precautionary steps."

Anthrax in cattle and buffalo is a constant in West Bengal. Anywhere from one to 2 dozen bovine outbreaks occur each year. Reported outbreaks in buffalo are more sporadic. - Mod.MHJ
