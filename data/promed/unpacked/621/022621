The issue regarding type A and B tularemia's environmental
persistence points out a very interesting situation and
potentially serious knowledge gaps when considering possible
bioterrorism: namely, the lack of background levels of
various potential agents.
For example, when _Bacillus anthracis_ spores were detected
in the fall of 2001, sampling took place in untold locations
throughout the country. Most were never examined in a
laboratory but rather simply segregated by threat
credibility. Samples of what were considered highly
credible may have been sent to a lab for analysis.
What if hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of
locations tested positive for _B. anthracis_? The number of
reports of white powder almost brought response and lab
personnel to the breaking point, even though only a small
fraction of samples were ever fully examined and fewer still
found to be positive.
In these reports, we find some evidence of possible
background levels of tularemia in various locations. Suppose
there was a reported bioterrorism attack involving _F.
tularensis_ or _B. anthracis_. Thousands of samples would
be again taken by emergency services personnel. Many would
also use bio-agent detector technologies to perform field
tests.
What should they expect to find? Are _B. anthracis_ or _F.
tularensis_ present as background organisms? If so, are
they background everywhere or only in certain environments?
If this information is not available, what is considered
"normal" or "safe"? What levels of organism require
remediation? Without answers to these and multiple other
thorny questions, the USA is at risk for a situation that
terrorizes the public for no reason other than a lack of
knowledge regarding natural background.
Consider if the levels of background radiation were not
identified. It would truly be a sad state of affairs when
testing was first begun.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dave Lesak for his comments. Background
levels for detection of these organisms are clearly needed.
For the moment, then, this thread -- which has stimulated
much discussion -- is cut. - Mod.LL]
