Tuberculosis in Far East of Russia
-----------------------------------
There is increasing tuberculosis morbidity at the territory of the Russian
Primorsky region with a connection to AIDS morbidity. [The Primorsky region
is in the far eastern area of Russia with Vladivostok and Nakhodka being
major cities. It is east of northern China and directly west of the Japan
Sea. -Mod. LL] There is an uncertain situation with tuberculosis statistics
in Russia and especially at the Far East of Russia. We have found a
tremendous increase of tuberculosis cases in the Primorsky region.
The Far East of Russia, especially the Primorsky Region, has the highest
number of tuberculosis cases in all of Russia. The morbidity of
tuberculosis among the population of the Primorsky Region has increased
from 45 cases per 1000 population in 1997 to 167 cases [per 1000]
population in 2002 [1.7 percent of the population with active TB -Mod.
LL]. The Primorsky Region is a territory with the climate and social
factors extremely influencing the level of morbidity. Since the middle of
the 1990s, a resurgence of TB has occurred, characterized by a 54 percent
to 140 percent increase in the rate of TB-related deaths among adults aged
25-44 years.
A vital factor contributing to this phenomenon is HIV infection. A recent
review of autopsy reports from the Vladivostok AIDS Center showed that 67
(42.4 percent) of 158 adult patients with AIDS were diagnosed with TB,
indicating that this disease is the most common opportunistic infection for
persons with AIDS. Commensurate with the increase in TB cases is a surge in
the prevalence of multidrug resistant TB in adult patients. Vladivostok's
tuberculosis laboratories in Vladivostok AIDS Center have reported a high
prevalence of multidrug resistant strains of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_;
15 (12.5 percent) of 120 in 2000 to 29 (17.8 percent) of 167 cases in 2002.
The age and gender of all TB-patients infected with HIV were: males older
than 25 years (47.6 percent), males younger than 25 years (26.1 percent),
females older than 25 years (16.9 percent) and females younger than 25
years (9.2 percent).

[Although ProMED-mail has not posted much data on tuberculosis, this report
from the far eastern area of Russia serves to illustrate the increasing
problem with TB as well as multi-drug -presumably at least isoniazid and
rifampin- disease and the relationship of increasing TB incidence to HIV
infection. The immunosuppression produced by the human retrovirus
infection allows a population with a high incidence of latent tuberculosis
to much more frequently express active infection.- Mod.LL]
