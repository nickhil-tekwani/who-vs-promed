Within the framework of the epidemiological surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced that 3 new cases of this virus have been recorded. The 1st case is a Saudi female citizen in the Eastern region, aged 63, who is suffering from chronic diseases, and her condition is stable. The 2nd one is a Saudi citizen in Al-Ahsa governorate, aged 75, who is suffering from chronic diseases as well, and still at ICU receiving the proper treatment. However, the 3rd case is a resident, aged 21, in Hafr Al-Batin, who passed away after being admitted to ICU at the beginning of this week [week of 10 Jun 2013].

The MOH has pointed out that it has tested 87 samples during the past 3 days, and all have been proved negative except what have been published.

[This raises the global total of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV to 58 including 32 deaths. According to the Saudi MOH website, this now raises the number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia to 43 including 27 deaths.

Hafr Al-Batin is located in the north eastern part of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia 90 km [56 mi] from the border with Kuwait and 70 km [44 mi] from the border with Iraq.

For a map showing the location of cases within Saudi Arabia, see the MOH webpage on coronavirus available at http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/HealthAwareness/Corona/Pages/AboutCorona.aspx (the case in Hafr Al-Batin is not identified as yet, but geographically it is located to the north west of Dammam.

International travel and health MERS-CoV - update [5 Jun 2013]
--------------------------------------------------------------
This guidance is an update to travel recommendations for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that WHO published on [20 May 2013].

Since September 2012, more than 50 cases of MERS-CoV have been identified globally. Approximately half of these people died. All cases identified so far have had either a direct or indirect connection with the Middle East. However, some cases identified in recent travellers from the Middle East have resulted in local, non-sustained transmission to close contacts. Thus far, all human-to-human transmission has occurred either in a household, work environment, or health care setting. The mode of transmission currently remains unknown. The virus is thought to be of animal origin but so far it has not been identified in any animal species. The specific types of exposures that result in infection are also unknown. MERS-CoV infection generally presents as pneumonia, but has also caused kidney failure. The most common symptoms observed are fever, cough, and breathing difficulties, while atypical symptoms such as diarrhoea have also been recorded in patients with immunosuppression.

Advice to health care practitioners:
- Consider the possibility of MERS-CoV infection in travellers with fever, cough, shortness of breath, or breathing difficulties, or other symptoms suggesting an infection, and with a recent history of travel in the Middle East.
- If a diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection is considered possible, apply infection prevention and control measures recommended by WHO, or outlined in national guidance, and refer the patient to a special infectious disease unit for further investigation.

Advice to ministries of health:
- Review current surveillance guidance and case definitions for case reporting available on the WHO coronavirus website.
- Alert health care practitioners to the possibility of MERS-CoV infection in symptomatic travellers with a recent history of travel in the Middle East.
- Provide health care practitioners with clear instructions for referral of patients suspected of having infection with the MERS-CoV for appropriate management and testing.

Advice to travellers:
Although the source of the virus and the mechanism of transmission is unknown, it would be prudent to try to reduce the general risk of infection while travelling by:
- Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections.
- Frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment.
- Adhering to food safety and hygiene rules such as avoiding undercooked meats, raw fruits and vegetables unless they have been peeled, or unsafe water.
- Avoiding close contact with live farm or wild animals

Travellers to the Middle East who develop symptoms either during travel or after their return are encouraged to seek medical attention and to share their history of travel. People with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practice cough etiquette (maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands) and to delay travel until they are no longer symptomatic.

Based on the information available, WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[The recommendations above for travel advice with respect to MERS-CoV are the most recent information available on the WHO website. The advice given is prudent for all levels of concern -- health care providers, ministries of health, and individual travelers. With the upcoming expected increase in travellers to Saudi Arabia for the Umrah and later on for the Hajj, recent days have seen a plethora of newswires promoting the use of face masks for all travellers making the upcoming pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.

Quotes from some of these newswires include: "According to the International Business Times, health officials are urging pilgrims who travel to Mecca during Ramadan to wear face masks to avoid contraction or spreading the disease, which so far has killed more than half of the people it has infected." (http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/12/un-warns-pilgrims-to-mecca-to-protect-themselves-against-deadly-coronavirus/#sthash.0AAewACX.dpuf).

"Ramadan Mecca Pilgrims to Wear Masks to Avert Coronavirus Epidemic. Health authorities urge pilgrims to wear facemasks to prevent spread of Middle East virus. People planning to make their way to Mecca for the Umrah, during the month of Ramadan, have been told to wear masks to lower the risk of infection." http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/477377/20130611/million-pilgrimage-coronavirus-risk-mecca-infection-mers.htm.

As the primary route of transmission of the MERS-CoV is still unknown, respiratory precautions in the community setting might (and the emphasis is on 'might') prevent the "close contact" person-to-person transmission, but reliance upon only respiratory precautions will not prevent possible hand-to-mouth or other mucous membrane spread, nor will it prevent spread from contact with contaminated foods or drinks if that is one of the routes of spread. - Mod.MPP]
