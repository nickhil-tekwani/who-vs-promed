Polio in Congo
--------------
As of 9 Nov 2010, 184 cases of acute flaccid paralysis and 85 deaths have
been reported from the site of the acute poliomyelitis outbreak centred in
Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo. 4 cases have been confirmed to have been
caused by wild poliovirus type 1 and laboratory testing continues. The
majority of the reported cases and deaths have occurred in the population
aged over 15 years.

Genetic sequencing has determined that the cases are caused by a poliovirus
most closely related to that circulating in neighbouring Angola. Congo had
recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000.

Nearly all cases have been reported from the port city of Pointe Noire,
with cases also reported from Niari (5), Bouenza (2), Brazzaville (1), and
Kouilou (2).

The Government of Congo has alerted the public to the outbreak and launched
an emergency response plan, with support from key partners, including WHO,
UNICEF, and the US CDC. The 1st vaccination response, using monovalent oral
polio vaccine type 1 (mOPV1), will start on [Fri 12 Nov 2010], to cover the
whole population of Porte Noire and Kouilou, in conjunction with the
neighbouring province of Cabinda in Angola. The rest of Congo will be
vaccinated starting [18 Nov 2010] using mOPV1. 2 additional nationwide
rounds are planned. The number, geographic extent, and target age groups of
further campaigns will be determined by the Government based on the
evolving epidemiology. The multi-country campaign may be further expanded
to cover additional bordering at-risk areas. New cases continue to be reported.

Countries across central Africa should strengthen surveillance for cases of
acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) to rapidly detect any poliovirus importations
and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also address any gaps in
polio immunization coverage to minimise the consequences of a poliovirus
introduction. As per the recommendations in the WHO publication
International Travel and Health, travellers to and from all countries where
polio is circulating, including the Republic of Congo and Angola, should be
fully protected by vaccination.

Given the recent progress towards polio eradication in Nigeria (98 per cent
reduction in cases in 2010 compared with the same period in 2009), rapidly
stopping the persistent poliovirus transmission in central Africa (that is,
Angola, DR Congo) and stopping new polio outbreaks such as in Congo, are
top international disease control priorities.

Congo: polio cases confirmed
----------------------------
At least 94 people have died, with 201 cases of acute flaccid paralysis
reported in the Republic of Congo (ROC), since [5 Nov 2010]. 4 cases have
been confirmed as wild poliovirus type 1, says the UN World Health
Organization (WHO).

"This is because [for the last] 15 years, immunization campaigns have not
been carried out due to the country's political instability. People who
were not vaccinated are vulnerable to the polio virus," Rod Curtis, a
communications officer with WHO's Global Polio Eradication Initiative, told
IRIN.

Most of those affected are people aged between 15 and 72.

Improving water and sanitation practices can help but in an emergency
situation like this, one of the fastest and most effective ways of stopping
the outbreak is through cross-border mass immunization because of
population movements, said Curtis.

Polio is an acute viral disease mainly affecting children under 5 that may
attack the central nervous system and is characterized by symptoms ranging
from a mild non-paralytic infection to total paralysis in hours.

At least 1.1 million people will be vaccinated in the epidemic's epicentre
in ROC's Pointe-Noire region. Another 600 000 people will be simultaneously
vaccinated in neighbouring Kebinga Province of Angola starting [11 Nov
2010], said Curtis.

Congo recorded its last case of indigenous polio in 2000 and WHO suspects
the virus reached Pointe-Noire through Kebinga, where 25 cases were
recorded in 2010, Curtis told IRIN.

A recent polio immunization campaign targeted some 72 million children in
15 countries across West and Central Africa, the 3rd [such campaign] in 2010.

"If all African countries continue to immunize children and maintain
surveillance systems, we'll witness a serious decline in the virus," said
Curtis.

Nigeria, the only remaining polio-endemic country in Africa, has reduced
the number of recorded polio cases from 382 in 2009 to 10 in 2010 with
regular immunization. Angola recorded 25 cases and the DRC 30 in 2009.
These 3 countries represent the greatest threat to polio eradication in
Africa, says WHO.

[In the last ProMED-mail report on this outbreak on 4 Nov 2010
(Poliomyelitis - worldwide (26): Rep. of Congo 20101104.3996), there were
120 cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) with 58 deaths, and 2 cases with
laboratory confirmation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of today's (9
Nov 2010) WHO update, the number of AFP cases is up to 184 with 85 deaths
(the Reuters newswire above has an increased count, reporting 201 cases of
AFP with 94 deaths). Additional new information are the reports of cases
occurring outside of Pointe Noire, 5 in Niari, 2 in Bouenza, 2 in Kouilou,
and 1 in Brazzaville. One suspects that as active case finding activities
are increased, more suspected cases (those with AFP) will be identified,
and with time, more of the AFP cases will have laboratory confirmation.
Additional new information is the linkage of the WPV1 to those circulating
in Angola.

The unusual age distribution of the cases may well be a reflection of years
of limited vaccination activities combined with low levels of WPV
circulation prior to interruption of transmission 10 years ago (the last
WPV case before this outbreak was in 2000) resulting in larger pockets of
susceptibles in the older age groups who missed both vaccination in their
childhood, and exposure to circulating WPV. Another question that arises,
is whether there were issues with vaccine potency in earlier years that may
have contributed to these apparent large pockets of susceptibles.
Information on vaccination histories of these older age group cases would
be of interest.

What is noteworthy here is that the initial vaccination campaign scheduled
for Pointe Noire and the remainder of the department of Kouilou is
targeting the entire population -- all age groups -- and not just the
population under 5 years of age (the usual target for immunization
campaigns in most countries), reflecting the epidemiology of this current
outbreak. There is mention of a planned simultaneous vaccination activity
in Cabinda -- the neighboring province of Angola.
