How Many Ebola Patients Have Been Treated Outside of Africa?
--------------------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 29 Dec 2014, at least 24 cases have been treated in Europe and the United States. [All except the Liberian treated in Texas] were health and aid workers who contracted Ebola in West Africa and were transported back to their home countries for treatment. The latest patient in the United States to have the disease arrived on 15 Nov 2014 and died 3days later while being treated in a biocontainment center in Omaha. Cases shown below are compiled from reports by the C.D.C., the World Health Organization, Doctors Without Borders and other agencies.

In the absence of denominators concerning those working with Ebola infected patients in west Africa, and their countries of residence, one cannot use these numbers to compute rates, but only describe numbers, occupations, places of treatment, and case fatality ratios. In some cases, infection occurred outside of west Africa, while treating patients infected in Africa. With these constraints, the data show:

3 cases occurred as a result of treatment outside of Africa of a patient infected in Africa. Of these 3 cases, none died. 21 cases were infected in Africa, and subsequent treatment occurred in Europe (13), of whom 3 are still in treatment, 9 recovered and 1 died. Of 8 cases infected in Africa and treated in the USA, 2 died. Of all 24, 21 had occupations as doctors, nurses, or church-related persons .

Besides the USA, treatment in Europe occurred in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway & the United Kingdom. ... -- more
