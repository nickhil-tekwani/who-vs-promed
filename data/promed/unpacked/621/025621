In Madagascar, the death toll from plague is rising. According to
official figures as 60 people died of the infectious disease. About
200 people were also infected with the plague, the health authority
said in Antananarivo. "We are very concerned," said Bruno Maes from
the UN children's agency UNICEF in the capital of Madagascar over the
rapid spread of the plague.

Meanwhile, almost all regions of the island nation in southeast
Africa are affected by the disease. Plague is transmitted primarily
through the bite of rat fleas to humans. Many rats flee in the rainy
season and periodic flooding from November to April in the villages
and towns.

[Pneumonic plague has been occurring in the region with spread from
person to person via the respiratory route. It is not clear how many
of these cases are due to plague pneumonia or if many are bubonic
plague cases, that in the absence of pneumonia, does not transmit from
person to person.

Primary pneumonic plague (one percent of natural plague
presentations) arises as a result of inhalation of plague bacilli in
infectious aerosols, such as would be produced when there are
secondary pneumonic complications in bubonic/septicemic plague.

Primary plague pneumonia has a short incubation period of 1-3 days,
after which there is sudden onset of flu-like symptoms including
fever, chills, headache, generalized body pains, weakness and chest
discomfort. A cough develops with sputum production, which may be
bloody, and increasing chest pain and difficulty in breathing. As the
disease progresses, hypoxia (low oxygen concentration in the blood)
and hemoptysis (coughing up blood) are prominent. The disease is
invariably fatal unless antimicrobial therapy commences within 24
hours of exposure.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of
infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.
CDC guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters as being at greatest
risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air
ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague
patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues
without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial
therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis are
tetracyclines, quinolones, or chloramphenicol. - Mod.LL]
