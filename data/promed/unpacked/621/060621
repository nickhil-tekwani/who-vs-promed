Spotlight on measles 2010: An epidemiological
overview of measles outbreaks in Poland in
relation to the measles elimination goal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
------------
The objective of this study was to describe
transmission chains of measles observed in Poland
during 2008-2009. A decade ago, the incidence of
measles in Poland declined and approached one
case per million inhabitants one of the World
Health Organization's criteria for measles
elimination. Following a period of very few
reported measles cases (2003 to 2005), an
increase in incidence was observed in 2006. Since
then, the incidence has constantly exceeded one
case per million inhabitants. Of 214 measles
cases reported in 2008 and 2009 in Poland, 164
(77 percent) were linked to 19 distinct
outbreaks, with 79 percent of cases belonging to
the Roma ethnic group. Outbreaks in the non-Roma
Polish population had different dynamics compared
to those in the Roma population. On average,
measles outbreaks in Roma communities involved 10
individuals, 7 of whom were unvaccinated, while
outbreaks in the non-Roma Polish population
involved 5 individuals, half of whom were
incompletely vaccinated. The majority of
outbreaks in Roma communities were related to
importation of virus from the United Kingdom. In
6 outbreaks, the epidemiologic investigation was
confirmed by identification of genotype D4
closely related to measles viruses detected in
the United Kingdom and Germany. Our data indicate
that Poland is approaching measles elimination,
but measles virus circulation is still sustained
in a vulnerable population. More efforts are
needed to integrate the Roma ethnic group into
the Polish health care system and innovative
measures to reach vulnerable groups should be explored.

Background
----------
In 1998 Poland implemented a measles elimination
programme, coordinated by the World Health
Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Europe. It
requires monitoring consecutive stages of the
elimination by tracking secondary outbreak cases,
genotyping of detected measles viruses (MV) and
serological testing of all suspected cases of measles [1].

Measles has been a notifiable disease in Poland
since 1919. National case-based notification was
initiated in 1996 and WHO case definitions [2]
have been adopted. Since 2005, the case
classification of the European Union [3] has been
used. The 1st dose of the monovalent measles
vaccine for children aged 13-15 months was
introduced in Poland in 1975, and the 2nd dose
for 7-year-old children was implemented in 1991.
In 2005 the monovalent measles vaccine was
replaced by the combined measles-mumps-rubella
(MMR) vaccine, administered at the age of 13-15 months and 10 years.

Poland belongs to the European countries with
moderate incidence of measles [4,5]. Following
the introduction of routine immunisation, the
incidence of measles has decreased. From 2003 to
2005 the number of locally acquired cases in
Poland was below the elimination threshold of one
case per million inhabitants. Since 2006 the
measles incidence has increased and remained
continuously above this elimination indicator
[6]. In 2006, measles cases were mostly related
to importation of MV-D4, whereas MV-D6 was
detected in 2007. In 2008-2009 a substantial
increase in the frequency of outbreak-related
cases was observed, often related to importation.

The vaccine coverage in Poland with MMR vaccine
remains well above the target of greater than 95
percent for the 1st dose of measles vaccine
(MCV1), another WHO marker for measles
elimination [7]. Coverage with the 1st dose of
MMR vaccine in 3-year-olds in 2008 was 98.4
percent, and for 2 doses of MMR in 11-year-olds
it was 97.2 percent. Information on measles
vaccine coverage in ethnic groups such as the
Roma ethnic minority is not available in Poland.

The objective of this study was to describe the
patterns of chains of transmission investigated
in Poland between 1999 and 2009, with special
focus on 2008-2009, in relation to the measles elimination goal.

Methods
-------
In the present study, measles cases reported
within the Polish enhanced measles surveillance
between 1999 and 2009 were investigated.
Physicians were required to report all suspected
measles cases to the local health departments and
to obtain samples for confirmatory IgM testing.
The information collected during case
investigation included demographic
characteristics, vaccination status, and clinical
and laboratory data. Although not routinely
collected in the national surveillance system,
the ethnic background of reported measles cases
was recorded. Contact tracing is routinely
undertaken, especially for unvaccinated and
exposed individuals. Serological testing and
detection of measles virus RNA are performed in
the National Reference Laboratory at the National
Institute of Public Health. Measles
virus-containing samples are sent to the WHO
Regional Reference Laboratory for Measles and
Rubella (Robert Koch Institute, Berlin) for genotyping.

For the present study, we defined an imported
outbreak as resulting from importation of measles
virus by a person arriving from abroad who was
exposed and developed symptoms outside Poland,
and subsequently was the source of documented
local transmission to other cases linked to the
outbreak. If available, genotyping results were
used for confirmation of importation-related transmission chains.

Measles case reports from 1999 to 2009 are
described. Measles cases with an established link
to the infection transmission chain (outbreak
cases) in 2008-2009 are described in more detail
to determine the role of disease importation and outbreak patterns.

Results
-------
Over time, an increasing proportion of measles
cases could be linked to identified chains of
transmission in Poland, from 6 percent in 1999 to
80 percent in 2009. Of 569 cases of measles
reported between 1999 and 2007, 133 (23 percent)
were linked to outbreaks. In 2008 and 2009, this
proportion was higher, with 77 percent reported
measles cases linked to outbreaks.

During 2008 and 2009, 19 measles outbreaks with
164 cases were reported in Poland. 7 outbreaks
were due to importation of the disease from the
United Kingdom (UK), and 12 involved only
indigenous transmission. Outbreaks in that period
were reported from 9 of the 16 provinces of
Poland. One of the 164 outbreak cases, excluded
from further analysis, occurred in a Ukrainian
citizen who arrived in Poland in February 2009.
He contracted measles while staying in a hospital where an outbreak occurred.

A total of 53 percent of cases in 2008 and 2009
were female and 90.2 percent of the patients were
residents of urban areas. Cases were seen in all
age groups, although adults aged over 19 years
were predominantly affected (45 cases, 27.4
percent). 130 patients (79.3 percent) were
admitted to hospital. The proportion of
hospitalised cases was highest in children aged 5
to 9 years (90.9 percent). 79 percent of all
outbreak-related cases during 2008 and 2009
occurred among the Roma ethnic group. [Romani
people, an ethnic group with origins in South
Asia who are widely dispersed with their largest
concentrated populations in Europe, especially
Central and Eastern Europe. Roma (Romani
subgroup), a subgroup of the Romani people who
live primarily in Central and Eastern Europe
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_people> - Mod.CP].

Outbreaks among Roma were considerably larger
with an average of 10 cases, who were mostly
unvaccinated (72 percent of outbreak cases),
while outbreaks in the non-Roma Polish population
involved an average of 5 cases, with 48 percent
of outbreak cases incompletely vaccinated. The
majority of outbreaks in Roma communities were
related to importation of virus from the UK. In 6
outbreaks, measles virus genotyping identified a
genotype D4 strain that was most closely related
to viruses from the UK and Germany. [A figure in
the original text presents the exact genetic
relationship between viruses isolated from
outbreak cases in 2008 and 2009 to closely
related strains isolated in other countries.]
Laboratory testing was performed more often for
cases from the non-Roma Polish population (94
percent) than for cases from the Roma community
(57 percent). Based on the dates recorded for
onset of disease, the same proportion of
outbreaks recorded up to four generations of
transmission among the Roma and non-Roma Polish population.

In some cases, separate outbreaks could be linked
by detailed epidemiological and molecular
investigation. From August to October 2008 2
outbreaks occurred in Mielec and Wroclaw, which
are approximately 400 km apart. A total of 32
cases were recorded from those 2 outbreaks in
Roma communities, and both could be linked to the
strain Enfield/GBR/14.07 (Accession No. EF600554)
of measles virus genotype D4. The index cases
were among families with young children returning
from London, UK. In the same period numerous
importations from England, confirmed by the
detection of the Enfield strain, were notified in
several other European countries , i.e., the
Netherlands (Den Haag.NLD/03.08, GenBank
Accession No. EU585844), Spain (Cadiz.SPA/
05.08/1, GenBank Accession No. EU982301) and Germany (Berlin.DEU/19.08).

From June to October 2009, 54 cases were linked
to 3 outbreaks in Roma communities living in
different towns. The 1st outbreak with 7 measles
cases was reported in the city of Lodz.
Subsequently, 47 measles cases were reported in
the city of Pulawy and Opole Lubelskie in
Lubelskie province. The outbreaks in Lodz and
Pulawy were linked by epidemiological
investigation and measles virus genotyping, since
the measles virus detected in Lodz and Pulawy was
identical to the strain Hamburg/DEU/03.09(D4)
observed in northwest Germany in the 1st quarter
of 2009. The outbreak in Opole Lubelskie was
linked to the Pulawy outbreak by an
epidemiological link, and no samples were collected for genotyping.

Discussion
----------
Measles outbreaks have recently been described in
many European countries. Large outbreaks were
reported in 2008 and 2009 in France [8], Switzerland [9], and Bulgaria [10].

WHO defined measles elimination as a situation in
a large geographical area in which endemic
transmission of measles virus cannot occur and
imported measles cases do not initiate sustained
transmission [11]. Despite public health efforts
and maintaining high levels of vaccination
coverage, outbreaks due to measles virus
importation continue to occur in Poland.
Similarly as in other European countries, herd
immunity has not been achieved despite a national
measles vaccination coverage above 95 percent.
This failure is possibly related to the existence
of specific vulnerable populations, who are often
not reached by the public health services
regarding vaccination. Common causes of limited
access to public health services may involve
particular attitudes or beliefs of these populations [12-14].

There could be several reasons for the increased
proportion of cases for which a chain of
infection could be traced in 2008 and 2009,
compared with the previous period. On the one
hand, local public health officers may have been
investigating the epidemiological links more
efficiently during the recent years. When
approaching the measles elimination phase, it
becomes more important to monitor infection
chains and, if necessary, to intervene. On the
other hand, well defined outbreaks were
identified in 2008 and 2009 with several cases
occurring in the same households. This rather
indicates an appearance of pockets of
unvaccinated persons, who are sustaining measles
transmission, possibly in relation to
anti-immunisation beliefs, or poor access to health care.

Similar to other European countries, Poland has
not succeeded in controlling measles enough to
reach one case per million inhabitants, one of
the WHO criteria for measles elimination. In
recent years, most outbreaks in Poland were
detected in ethnic minorities and were often
related to measles importation from the United
Kingdom or Germany. Currently, the emphasis of
measles elimination activities should be directed
to immunising all sections of the population that
are not adequately protected. Considering that
ethnic minorities are often marginalised and
discriminated against, we need to better
understand the health problems, attitudes and
beliefs of these communities. An assessment
performed during a large outbreak in August 2009,
revealed limited access to health care and low
life expectancy of a settled Roma community [15].
Both in Roma and in the non-Roma Polish
population, a considerable proportion of
unvaccinated cases in the under 19-year-olds
indicates the need to address at least some
high-risk groups in Poland. The best approach
would be to focus on health care workers and
persons working in crowded environments like schools, universities or airports.

Genetic characterisation of detected measles
viruses has been done in Poland continuously
since 2006 [16]. Molecular and epidemiological
investigation of the recent outbreaks revealed 5
independent transmission chains with a duration
of under 3 months. Genetic data demonstrated a
close relationship of 4 of the 5 distinct
subvariants of genotype D4 identified in Poland
to viruses of western Europe (GenBank Accession
No. EF600554, EU585844, EU982301, GQ370461) from
where they were imported, and to a virus from
India (GenBank Accession No. EU812270) considered
to be the source of the recent European D4
viruses [Regional Reference Laboratory WHO EURO,
Robert Koch Institute, personal communication].
The present analyses document that Poland has
made progress on its way to reach the elimination
goal for measles virus in the WHO European
region. Considering increasing airline travel,
and anti-vaccination beliefs, continuous efforts
are necessary to maintain a high vaccination
status of the Polish population, and implement
innovative measures to reach vulnerable groups.

[Although this analysis relates to the period
2008-2009, the information is relevant to the
current situation in Europe. Somewhat
unexpectedly the majority of outbreaks in Roma
communities in Poland were related to importation
of virus from the UK (possibly some via Germany).
In 6 outbreaks, measles virus genotyping
identified a genotype D4 strain that is most
closely related to viruses prevalent in the UK
and Germany, and to a virus from India considered
to be the source of the recent European D4 viruses.

Despite public health efforts and maintenance of
high levels of vaccination coverage, outbreaks
due to measles virus importation continue to
occur in Poland. As in other European countries,
herd immunity has not been achieved despite a
national measles vaccination coverage above 95
percent. This failure is possibly related to the
existence of specific vulnerable populations,
which often are not reached by the public health
services providing routine vaccination services.

The implementation of new measures to reach
vulnerable groups will be required to maintain
the high vaccination status of the Polish population. - Mod.CP]
