Clusters of cryptosporidiosis in south east England:
A total of 85 cases of cryptosporidiosis have been reported to the PHLS
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) from four districts
within the water distribution zone that covers West Hertfordshire, Brent
and Harrow, part of north Hillingdon, and Barnet since 25 February 1997.
Cryptosporidial oocysts were found in samples of
treated water supplying the area. The water company
issued a 'boil water' notice dated 2 March to 300 000 properties.
A team has been set up to manage this incident. CDSC (Anglia and Oxford)
is coordinating the epidemiological studies.
Three clusters reported in Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire since the
middle of January 1997 have been investigated by local outbreak teams.
No common factors were identified among cases. The water supplies to the
areas concerned are apparently distinct. Cryptosporidial oocysts were
not detected in any of the three water distribution systems supplying
the affected areas. The water companies rerouted supplies to two of the
affected areas and introduced other precautionary measures. The cluster
in Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield consisted of ten cases who became ill
between 15 January and 7 February; no other primary cases were reported
in February. The other clusters were in Bedford and in Luton.
On 5 March, cryptosporidium-like oocysts were detected in one sample of
treated water in the Luton area and a 'boil water' notice was issued as
a precaution.
Cryptosporidiosis is usually self limiting, but severely
immunocompromised people may develop severe and life threatening
disease.
Dr Lorna Willocks, regional epidemiologist for Anglia and Oxford
(tel 01223 331865; fax 01223 330345) would welcome reports of
cases of cryptosporidiosis that may be associated with these clusters.
