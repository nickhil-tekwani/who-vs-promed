Pilchard deaths - Australia (South Australia)(11) 981218212749

Update of spread:
The pilchard mortality front has spread east into New South Wales [NSW
with reports of dead pilchards on Newcastle beaches and offshore from
Hallidays Point (a little south of Old Bar).To date, all pilchards
sighted are adult fish (approximately 160 mm in length), with gonads
appearing inactive. Consistent with other Australian States' reports,
pilchards seem the only species affected. Despite monitoring, there have
been no reports of dead pilchards in the area between the last eastern
most sighting in Victoria (8 Dec.) and Newcastle.
The fish involved in the mortality in the Derwent estuary and Frederick
Henry Bay, Tasmania, have been positively identified by fisheries
scientists as pilchards. The mortality front is slowly continuing
westward in Western Australia [WA, with new mortalities at Bremer Bay.
Mortalities have also been reported behind the mortality front, about
20km south east of Esperance. The reporting of dead pilchards behind the
mortality front is in contrast to the 1995 pilchard mortality. Also,
spread of mortality seems much slower than in 1995. There were no new
reports of pilchard mortality in Victoria or South Australia.
Control measures:
In WA Zone 4 (the Esperance zone) of the South Coast Purse Seine Managed
Fishery has been closed from 30 December until the end of February.
Zones 1 and 3, and Zone 2 east of 117Â°E, have been closed from midnight
Tuesday, 26 January 1999, until 26 February 1999. In NSW, commercial and
recreational fishing for pilchards have been closed from Diamond Head,
south of Camden Haven in Crowdy Bay National Park, to Wamberal Point,
north of Terrigal, on 14 January. As there have been no reports of dead
pilchards in Victorian waters since 8 December, Fisheries Victoria
re-opened the Victorian pilchard fishery on 14 January. The South
Australian pilchard fishery remains open in the absence of mortality.
Public health:
Health authorities in each affected State have advised the public not to
take dead pilchards from the beach for consumption, bait or use as pet
food.
Diagnostic testing:
Samples of dead /dying pilchards from the new mortalities in WA and NSW
are being tested at State Laboratories and at the CSIRO Australian
Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong, Victoria. Diagnostic results
of pilchards from WA confirmed the presence of a herpes virus in gills.
There are no results available yet from NSW pilchards. AAHL at Geelong
reported promising initial success in maintaining cells from various
pilchard organs; susceptibility to the pilchard herpesvirus has not been
tested to date.
Transmission trails:
To date, the cause of the mortality has not been established, although
the herpesvirus appears closely associated. To prove Henle-Koch's
postulates, virus transmission trials, with healthy pilchards kept in
tanks, began in WA on 14 January. Gill homogenates of infected, freshly
dead, pilchards collected from the mortality front are being used as the
inoculum.
Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases:
The pilchard mortality continues to be handled under Australia's
Consultative Committee on Emergency Animal Diseases CCEAD. In this
aquatic animal emergency event, CCEAD links States/Territories Directors
of Fisheries and States/Territories Chief Veterinary Officers with
Commonwealth authorities and the CSIRO Australian Animal Health
Laboratory. CCEAD is chaired by the Australian Chief Veterinary Officer,
Dr. Gardner Murray.
Multidisciplinary scientific consultations:
CCEAD endorsed the research program developed by its Joint
Multidisciplinary Pilchard Scientific Working Group. The research
program includes the following 5 objectives:
Determine the cause of the mortalities;
Determine the origin of the pathogen;
Determine the trigger for the onset of mortalities;
Develop diagnostic tools;
Develop a clear understanding of the epizootiology of the
mortality episode.
Proposals for four specific high priority research projects will shortly
be submitted to various Australian funding bodies to progress the
objectives, including on-going examination of small fish survivors and
fish not impacted by the mortality event; pilchard virus transmission
studies; generation of diagnostic reagents for pilchard herpes virus;
and the development of a model of the pilchard mortality in southern
Australian waters.
Next steps:
Fisheries authorities will continue to cooperate closely with commercial
fishing industries to monitor the spread of the mortality east and west.
The Scientific Working Group will reconvene on February 23, to assess
the development of diagnostic work and results of transmission trials.
We will advise of further developments.
