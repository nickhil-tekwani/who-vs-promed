China gears up to battle wheat, rape diseases
----------------------------------------------
China is enhancing its efforts to battle plant diseases spreading in
the country's wheat and rape plantations.

As of 1 Apr [2008], 9.52 million mu (634 667 hectares) of the
country's wheat has developed stripe rust, a serious disease caused
by a soil-borne fungus, according to Ministry of Agriculture
statistics released on Monday [7 Apr 2008]. Meanwhile, 17.33 million
mu of [oilseed] rape have been affected by a devastating disease
called sclerotinia. The situation might get worse as the April-June
period is a season prone for plant diseases and insect pests with
warm weather and frequent rainfalls expected.

According to a ministry forecast, the current disease reports would
only account for 24 and 39 percent of the total areas of wheat and
rape plantings, respectively, that could develop such diseases this
year. However, the ministry did not say the proportion of the
disease-affected area in the sown area. The ministry has told local
governments to beef up their control of the spread of such diseases
and intensify monitoring. Local governments were required to quickly
report new infections to higher-level authorities.

[Wheat stripe rust
------------------
Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly
in cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of
plants, and reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield
losses may vary from 40 up to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some
barley varieties, triticale (wheat/rye hybrids), and a number of
grass species. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the
cropping season. Since the fungus interferes with seed development,
infection early in the crop cycle is more damaging than infection
after seed fill has concluded.

Spores are dispersed by wind and mechanical means. The fungus needs
living plants to survive between seasons, it cannot survive on seed,
stubble, or in soil. Volunteer plants may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum to infect new crops. New pathogen strains with
increased virulence have been reported from several wheat growing
areas. Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties,
fungicide applications, and control of volunteer cereals. Disease
monitoring, which according to the above report is now being
undertaken by the Chinese authorities, is important so timely action
can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up
of inoculum.

Oilseed rape sclerotinia
------------------------
Sclerotinia of oilseed rape (also called stem rot, white mold), is
caused by the fungus _Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_. This soil-borne
fungus is among the most nonspecific, omnivorous and successful of
plant pathogens and is present worldwide in a wide range of climates.
Almost 400 host species are known, including many broad leaved crops.
The pathogen is primarily soil-borne and has a complex disease cycle.
Normally, spores must first germinate on dead plant material such as
dead leaves or fallen flower petals caught in between the stems and
leaves, before they can invade healthy tissues. Cool, wet weather
favours the disease providing enough moisture for infection. On
oilseed rape, infected leaves collapse around the stem, then stem
lesion showing a typical bleached appearance develop. Infections high
on the stems result in contamination of the seed with sclerotia (hard
survival structures).

The fungus can survive in soil as sclerotia and is also spread by
infected plant material, mechanical means and wind-borne spores. It
is thought that it may also survive in the soil by colonising the
roots of other plant species which then serve as inoculum sources for
crops. Risk of crop infection depends on the previous disease history
of a field as well as weather conditions. Disease management includes
cultural practices (such as long-term crop rotation with non-hosts)
and fungicide applications. A related species, _S. minor_, also
causes similar blight diseases on a number of crops.
