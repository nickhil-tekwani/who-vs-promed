In a follow-up on a report yesterday [10 Jun 2021] about monkeypox cases reported in Wales, the World Health Organization (WHO) provided some additional details in a Disease Outbreak News (DON) today [11 Jun 2021]:

On 25 May 2021, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland notified the WHO of one laboratory-confirmed case of monkeypox. The patient arrived in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2021. Prior to travel, the patient had lived and worked in Delta State, Nigeria.

On arrival in the United Kingdom, the patient remained in quarantine with family due to COVID-19 restrictions. On 10 May [2021], the patient developed a rash, beginning on the face. The patient remained in self-isolation for a further 10 days and sought medical care for relief of symptoms. The patient was admitted to a referral hospital on 23 May [201]. Skin lesion samples were received at the Public Health England Rare and Imported Pathogens Laboratory on 24 May [2021]. The West African clade of monkeypox virus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 25 May [2021].

On 29 May [2021], a family member with whom the patient quarantined developed lesions clinically compatible with monkeypox and was immediately isolated in an appropriate facility. Monkeypox was confirmed on 31 May [2021]. Both patients are stable and recovering.

The health authorities of the United Kingdom activated an incident management team and implemented public health measures, including isolation of the index case and secondary case and contact tracing of all close contacts in the hospital and community.

Follow up is being undertaken for the contacts of the 2 cases for 21 days after their last exposure. No close contacts have travelled outside the United Kingdom following exposure. Post-exposure vaccination was not offered to contacts.

Information was shared with the Nigerian National IHR Focal Point, who have initiated an outbreak investigation and are gathering further information regarding the potential source of infection and exposures in Nigeria.

[Monkeypox (MPX) cases have been reported in Nigeria since 2017, and transmission of the virus continues. The above case presumably acquired the monkeypox virus infection there.

An 11 Jun 2021 report of monkeypox cases in Nigeria provides more detail, stating, "Since September 2017, Nigeria has continued to report sporadic cases of monkeypox. From September 2017 to May 2021, a total of 446 suspected monkeypox cases have been reported from 30 states. Of the reported cases, 199 (44.6%) have been confirmed in 18 states: Abia (3), Akwa Ibom (7), Anambra (2), Bayelsa (39), Benue (2), Cross River (13), Delta (22), Ebonyi (1), Edo (7), Ekiti (2), Enugu (4), FCT (5), Imo (8), Lagos (25), Nasarawa (2), Oyo (6), Plateau (3) and Rivers (48). A total of 8 deaths have also been recorded (CFR= 4.02%) in 6 states: Cross River (1), Edo (2), FCT (1), Imo (1), Lagos (2) and Rivers (1). In 2021, a total of 32 suspected cases have been reported from January and May. Of the suspected cases, 7 were confirmed from 5 states Delta (2), Bayelsa (2), Lagos (1), Edo (1), Rivers (1), and no deaths were recorded (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/monkeypox-in-nigeria-and-drc-updates-84788/).

Interestingly, there have been 2 previously imported monkeypox case from Nigeria. In December 2019, a patient believed to have contracted the infection while visiting Nigeria was staying in southwest England prior to transfer to the specialist high-consequence infectious disease centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, where treatment was given (see Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532). in 17 Sep 2018, there were 2 people who contracted the disease in Nigeria before traveling to England. One was a Nigerian resident in Cornwall, followed by the case at the Blackpool Victoria hospital. A healthcare worker who cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made contracted the infection (see Monkeypox - UK (04): ex Nigeria, more details 20180926.60539892019).

The question remains about the source of these recent infections and the index case above. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently. Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced on 11 Jun 2021 that the company was recently engaged by Public Health England (PHE) and the Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to supply its IMVANEX smallpox vaccine in response to new cases of monkeypox in the UK. Even if a vaccine was available for use in Africa, deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area where the virus occurs would be a challenge.
