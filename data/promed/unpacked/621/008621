[1] Ministry of Health press release: Kerala, domestic ducks, low public health risk

A number of wild birds died in National Zoological Park and Deer Park, both situated in Delhi and Zoological Park, Gwalior [Madhya Pradesh] in the preceding 2 weeks. Domesticated bird deaths (ducks) were reported this week [week of 24 Oct 2016] from Alappuzha District of Kerala. In all these instances, samples tested at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal were found positive for avian influenza A(H5N8).

On the public health risk of avian influenza A(H5N8), World Health Organization has informed that "based on current knowledge, the risk of zoonotic transmission is considered low for H5N8."

As a matter of abundant caution, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has advised the State Health Departments to use personal protective equipment by those handling dead/sick birds, keep persons exposed to the dead/sick birds under surveillance, and provide them chemoprophylaxis (oseltamivir 75 mg once daily for 10 days).

A Joint Coordination Committee in the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries, with representation from Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is monitoring the situation.

Bird flu (avian influenza), caused by H5N8 virus, has been detected among ducks at 5 places in Alappuzha district.

The viral infection has been found at Thakazhy, Kainadi, Ramankary, Neelamperoor, and Pandi, District Collector Veena N Madhavan told mediapersons on [Tue 25 Oct 2016]. [District collector, often abbreviated to Collector, is the foremost Indian Administrative Service officer in charge of revenue collection and administration of a district in India].

A total of 20 special teams have been deployed in the affected areas to tackle the flu. Infected ducks would be isolated and culled at locations to be identified by the official teams. Each team will have 2 veterinary surgeons and 2 livestock inspectors. In addition, there will be 2 labourers, attenders, revenue officials, and policemen each, apart from representatives of the respective panchayats [local self-government council].

The Collector said the presence of the virus was confirmed at an examination conducted at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal. Ducks with symptoms of bird flu were initially found in certain places on 19 Oct 2016.

The H5N8 virus is not as disastrous as H5N1, the variety found during the bird flu outbreak [in Kerala] in 2014, said Animal Husbandry Department Director NN Sasi.

The virus might have been carried by migratory birds, he said.

The Collector said there would be restrictions on movement of ducks in the district for the next 10 days. There will be random checks at meat sales outlets.

There is no harm in consumption of eggs or meat of unaffected birds. The virus is not transmitted from bird to human beings. In case people in close contact with the affected birds develop symptoms of fever, they should consult the doctor.

If symptoms of the virus attack are found among poultry birds, the matter should be reported to Animal Husbandry Department officials. One of the initial symptoms among the affected birds is the appearance of bluish colour in the eyes.

A helpdesk has been opened at the Animal Husbandry Department office in Alappuzha in the wake of the incidence of avian influenza. The phone number is 0477 2252636.

A previous government press release, by India's Ministry of Agriculture, was published on 21 Oct 2016. It reported the initial and 1st confirmation (in non-poultry birds) of the avian influenza H5N8 virus in India. This information was kindly submitted to ProMED-mail from ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (OIE Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza), Anandnagar, Bhopal (see archive no. 20161021.4576300).

The initial information referred to the mortality of wild (not captive) birds in the National Zoological Park (NZP), New Delhi, which had started on 14 Oct 2016. Until 17 Oct 2016, 9 birds had died: 5 rosy pelican (_Pelecanus onocrotalus_), 3 (wild) ducks, and one painted stork (_Mycteria leucocephala_). On 18 Oct 2016, the Delhi Zoo was closed by the authorities. On 21 Oct 2016, samples were received from the Gandhi Zoological Park, Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh state, where 15 painted storks were found infected by the H5N8 virus strain. The Ministry of Agriculture press release (http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=151861) indicated that according to OIE's Terrestrial Code, "avian Influenza disease in wild/migratory birds does not affect the status of the country; hence there are no trade implications."

The current cases in a 3rd Indian state, Kerala, involve domestic ducks, which are defined in the Code as "poultry". Notification to the OIE is anticipated.

The H5N8 virus strain has never been reported in India. During 2015, H5N8 HPAI was reported from several countries in North America, Europe, and Asia, in wild and domestic birds, while, in 2016, it has occurred in the Russian Federation, in Taiwan, in the Republic of Korea and, now, in India.

The Indian territory is included in the southern part of the Central Asian Flyway. Before the recent events, since 2006, only H5N1 HPAI had been detected on an annual basis, affecting both wild and domestic birds. The latest available information on H5 clades circulating in India is from 2015, when 2.3.2.1a and 2.3.2.1c were isolated. Given the fact that a new strain was detected in the country, more details on its genetic characterization are awaited to better understand the possible source of this event. FAO EMPRES Watch Vol 35 of Sep 2016 included an assessment of the potential for international spread by wild/migratory birds of HPAI H5N8 of clade 2.3.4.4 (see archive no. 20160920.4501532 and http://www.fao.org/3/a-i6113e.pdf).

Until now, no human infections with H5N8 have been established anywhere in the world. However, necessary precautions are to be undertaken while handling sick/dead birds and contaminated material during control and containment operations. - Mod.AS
