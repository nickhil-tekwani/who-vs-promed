Russia's Far East village kills all livestock to stop foot and mouth outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
(excerpt from report by Russian news agency ITAR-TASS)
All livestock have been killed in the village of Busse, Amur Region,
following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD]. A total of 236
cattle have been slaughtered, a duty officer of the Russian Emergencies
Ministry's Far East regional center told RIA.
The destruction and burial of slaughtered animals continued on Mon [20 Jun
2005]. A total of 600 kg of napalm has been brought to Busse to incinerate
the corpses. [Passage omitted.]
The outbreak has been caused by Asia 1 virus. Yesterday [19 Jun 2005], 20
000 doses of polyvalent vaccine were brought to the Amur Region.
"Russia has not seen this type of virus so far. It has penetrated from
China. This is an entirely new virus, and local cattle has not adapted to
it yet," Aleksandr Nesterenko, head of the agro-industrial department of
the Amur Region administration, told RIA. [Cattle do not "adapt" to FMD
virus; they can get immunized, either following natural infection or by
vaccination. - Mod.AS]
Security measures in the southern part of Russia's Far East have been
stepped up due to the FMD outbreak in the Amur Region. [Passage omitted to
end.]

[Russia's notification to the OIE dated 15 Jun 2005 states that "the animal
population of the village includes a total of approximately 120 cattle, 25
small ruminants and 20 pigs."

The current newswire mentions 256 cattle but gives no data about the other
susceptible species. An official update with the actual figures of
susceptible and destroyed animals of each species, and particularly
information on the disease situation in pigs, would help. - Mod.AS]
