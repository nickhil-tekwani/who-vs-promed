Bird flu outbreak reported in North Korea, South Korean aid group says
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu has broken out near a North Korean military base in the 1st
reported case of the disease in the country since 2005, a South Korean aid
group said on Wednesday [11 Jun 2008].

The outbreak occurred last week [1-7 Jun 2008] near an air force base in
Jongpyong county in South Hamgyong province, north east of the capital
Pyongyang, [according to] the Seoul-based private aid group Good Friends;
[it cited] the North's quarantine authorities. The case was 1st reported 3
Jun 2008, when several birds were found dead in a small mountain area near
the military base, said the aid agency. There were no details on whether it
was the H5N1 virus, which can be deadly to humans.

South Korea's Unification Ministry said it could not immediately confirm
the report. [North Korea's earlier denial was posted in ProMED-mail
yesterday: Undiagnosed fatal disease - North Korea (02) 20080613.1867. -

Separately, dozens of magpies were found dead inside a political prison
camp in Hwasong in North Hamgyong province, said Good Friends. A prison
camp official's 5 year old child subsequently suffered a high fever and
died, the group said. There was no way to confirm if the child caught a
virus from the birds or to know what killed the child. The
Buddhist-affiliated group that sends food and other aid to the North also
said 2 prisoners showed similar symptoms and 3 others were subsequently
diagnosed with an unidentified virus.

Good Friends has previously provided information on the North that has
proven correct but does not provide information on its sources, out of fear
they could face retribution.

The case prompted the authorities to quarantine people inside the prison
camp and launched preventive measures, but they failed to identify the
disease, said the aid agency. It had no details of measures taken. The
North's outbreak came after South Korea slaughtered 8.46 million chickens,
ducks and other poultry in recent months to stem the spread of bird flu.

Bird flu was last known to have hit North Korea in 2005, leading to the
killing of about 210 000 birds.

Hong Kong to slaughter all market poultry in the territory after detecting
bird flu
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health workers plan to slaughter all live poultry in Hong Kong's street
markets after detecting the dangerous H5N1 bird flu virus, officials said
on Wednesday [11 Jun 2008].

The action comes after tests showed birds infected in 4 markets, said
Cheung Siu-hing, director for agriculture, fisheries and conservation. It
was unclear how many birds would be killed, but markets were selling around
3500 birds as of Tuesday night, Cheung said. The move affects all retail
poultry vendors in the territory.

The virus has not been detected in samples from local chicken farms and
distribution centers, officials said. Nor have any people been sickened in
the latest outbreak. "We're closely monitoring the possibility of human
cases and we will remain alert," said Thomas Tsang, head of the
government's health monitoring agency.

Health workers killed 2700 poultry on Saturday [7 Jun 2008] in a market
after routine testing showed 5 chickens were infected with the virus. The
government also temporarily banned supplies from all live poultry from
mainland China and local farms.

Hong Kong's last major bird flu outbreak was in 1997, when the H5N1 strain
jumped to humans and killed 6 people. That prompted the government to
slaughter the entire poultry population of about 1.5 million birds.

[In contrast to Hong Kong's exemplary transparency, North Korea's animal
health situation in general, and the avian influenza situation in
particular, are rather hazy.

According to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) World Animal
Health Information Database (WAHID) interface, no periodic reports have
been submitted by North Korea since 2005 (WAHID's inauguration year).

An avian influenza outbreak was suspected in North Korea on 15 Mar 2005
(see 20050315.0752), and was announced officially in the country on 27 Mar
2005. On 7-8 Apr 2005, the national authorities officially informed the OIE
about the diagnosed H7 outbreak (see 20050408.1016). The notification
included the following statement: "Tests are currently under way to
determine the N subtype of the virus". A report on the results of the said
tests, as well as the source/origin of the outbreak/infection, is not known
to us.

The current North Korean denial of rumors promulgated by 3rd parties refers
to human cases. Have cases in birds been observed? If they have, have they
been investigated? First hand information would be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
