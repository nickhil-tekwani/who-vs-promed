The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] is advising countries to be on high alert for possible spread of the highly pathogenic H5N8 virus subtype detected recently in wild birds at Lake Ubsu-Nur in the Tuva Republic of the Russian Federation.

In late May and early June 2016, surveillance activities conducted in wild migratory bird populations at Lake Ubsu-Nur detected a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N8 subtype. The virus was confirmed in samples collected from several species of waterfowl, including black-headed gulls, grey heron, great cormorants, great-crested grebe, common terns, and ducks.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses subtypes H5 or H7 often cause high morbidity and mortality in gallinaceous poultry, such as domestic chickens. They can also affect other poultry, such as ducks, geese and quail, although some strains can produce only mild or even asymptomatic infections in waterfowl. HPAI viruses of the H5 type are sometimes isolated from wild birds, mostly aquatic species. Morbidity and mortality in these birds varies from species to species and between seasons, and depends on the age and immunological experience of individual birds.

Ubsu-Nur is a vast wetland area that attracts an abundance of diverse aquatic birds. It is an important stopover site for migratory birds using the Central Asian flyway, which covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic and Indian oceans.

"With the post-breeding movements of water birds, there is a possibility that the pathogen could be introduced into the Siberian lowland, thus opening a way for the virus to invade stopover sites along the West Eurasian and Afro-Eurasian water bird migration systems," said FAO disease ecology expert and co-author of the report Sergei Khomenko.

According to FAO, it is possible that the H5N8 virus will spread westward and southward in the same manner observed with the earlier another emergent highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1. For this reason, it recommends that countries in Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Middle East, Europe, and West Africa -- especially those that have experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the past -- be on alert and increase their passive surveillance over the next 6 to 12 months.

[The Central Asian flyway covers a large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. This flyway comprises several important migration routes of waterbirds that migrate over immense distances. The Central Asian flyway was considered to be an important route of dispersion for HPAI H5N1. Previous studies showed that H5N1 outbreaks were associated with movements of ruddy shelduck (_Tadorna tadorna_). It is important to note that for a migratory bird to spread the virus, it should be healthy enough to fly long distances, so usually they are not the most affected species. Here there were a variety of aquatic bird types in which HPAI H5 virus was detected. - Mod.PMB
