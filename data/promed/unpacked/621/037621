Scientists warned on Thursday [19 Jan 2006] that bird flu would return and
that southern regions would be the 1st to suffer. The 1st regions that will
be hit when migrating birds come back after the winter will be Stavropol,
Rostov and Krasnodar, as well as the republics of Dagestan and Kalmykia,
said Konstantin Litvin, head of the bird-tagging center at the Academy of
Sciences' Institute of Ecology and Evolution.
"Wild birds are the main source of transmitting avian flu," he told
reporters [see commentary]. The birds will return from Turkey, Central
Asia, and other warmer regions when it begins to warm up in Russia, and the
first could fly to the Moscow region as early as the end of March, he said.
H5N1, the deadly strain of the avian flu, is thought to have killed at
least 79 people in 6 countries since 2003. The virus is spreading from
birds to people, and scientists fear it might become communicable from
person to person.
Unlike mad cow disease and other recent scares, "avian flu is a real
danger," said Viktor Zubakin, president of Russia's Bird Preservation
Union. He and other scientists at the same news conference warned against
shooting wild birds, saying that doing so would hasten the spread of the
virus. "Those birds would be left for predators, crows, which frequent
residential areas, so we would bring infected birds closer to us," said
Alexei Zimenko, head of the Wildlife Preservation Center.
Some lawmakers have suggested shooting birds migrating from Turkey, which
is fighting a bird flu outbreak. Scientists also cautioned that vaccinating
domestic fowl was not the best answer. Vaccinations dull the symptoms but
do not eradicate the virus, making the culling of birds in affected areas
the most effective way to combat bird flu, they said. Bird flu hit several
Russian regions [during the summer of 2005], but no cases of people
catching the disease have been recorded.

[Dr Litvin's statement about the role of wild birds in the dissemination of
H5N1 is probably based upon the results of virological investigations
carried out in 2 laboratories, namely the Federal Centre for Animal Health
(FGI-ARRIAH) in Vladimir (national reference laboratory for avian
influenza) and the State Scientific Centre for Virology and Biotechnology
in Novosibirsk ('NPC Vector'). The data are included in Russia's follow-up
report No 5, sent 27 Dec 2005 to the OIE (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_38.htm#Sec4>).
Phylogenetic trees constructed from fragments of the HA gene (nucleotides
801-1113 ) and NA gene (nucleotides 605-937 ) show that Russian isolates of
the year 2005 exhibit greatest sequence similarity with the A/Qinghai/05
H5N1 group of isolates.
The HA gene homology was shown in the following isolates:
A/mallard/Kalmykia/09/2005
A/swan/Astrakhan/04/05
A/wild duck/Kurgan/01/2005
A/wild duck/Omsk/01/2005
A/duck/Novosibirsk/04e1/2005
A/chicken/Crimea/06/2005
A/duck/Novosibirsk/02e1/2005
A/gull/Kurgan/02/2005
A/duck/Tumen/02/2005
A/Bar-headed Goose/Qinghai/5/05
A/chicken/Chelyabinsk/05/2005
A/wild duck/Tumen/01/2005

The inclusion of the Crimean (Ukraine) isolate underlines the claim that
the virus has been transported by wild birds. - Mod.AS]
