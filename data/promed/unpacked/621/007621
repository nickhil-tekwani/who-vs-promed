The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 21 Feb 2019:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 859, of which 794 are confirmed and 65 are probable. In total, there were 536 deaths (471 confirmed and 65 probable).
- 179 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 6 new confirmed cases: 2 in Katwa, 2 in Butembo, 1 in Kalunguta and 1 in Beni.
- 5 new confirmed case deaths: 3 community deaths -- 2 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo; 2 deaths in Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), including 1 in Katwa and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response
New confirmed case of Ebola in Beni
------------------------------------
A new confirmed case of Ebola was reported in Beni after 23 days without a case. It appears that the patient was infected after being exposed to bodily fluids from an Ebola-recovered case. A thorough investigation and sequencing of the virus are underway to determine the epidemiological link.

Relocation of strategic coordination in Goma
---------------------------------------------
The Ebola strategic coordination move from Beni to Goma began this Fri 22 Feb 2019. The strategic coordination is the team that coordinates the conduct of the response in its entirety and oversees all operational sub-coordination in the different health zones affected.

The Minister of Health (MoH), Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, made the decision to relocate the strategic coordination in Goma at the end of November 2018 to clearly dissociate the strategic activities of planning and supervision of operational activities on the ground. In addition, by moving strategic coordination to Goma, all MoH partners will be able to more easily obtain the necessary security clearances from their respective organizations to work with the Ebola virus disease response teams.

This move will not disrupt the day-to-day activities of the field response. Beni's sub-coordination leading all activities on the ground remains in place until the complete end of the epidemic throughout the region, like the other sub-coordinations, notably those of Butembo, Katwa, Bunia, Lubero, and others.

It is important to note that this move to Goma in no way means that the Ebola outbreak has reached the city, although it remains exposed. On the contrary, the experience of the past 6 months has demonstrated the importance of placing strategic coordination in an area not affected by the epidemic to allow it to focus exclusively on the supervision, monitoring and planning of the epidemic.

Vaccination
-----------
Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 82 583 people have been vaccinated. [See the source URL for exact numbers in each location.]

Small #Ebola setback today. Beni reported its first case in 23 days. Seems a woman was infected by a survivor -- possible sexual transmission case, but that detail is not given. The good news is the case was diagnosed. Hopefully there won't be additional cases from it.]

News of the response
Surveillance in Vuhovi
--------------------
- In the past 2 days, there has been a decline in the follow-up of contacts in Vuhovi because of the mourning of health staff and community relays following the kidnapping and assassination of a nurse from the Bisongo health center by a group of unidentified people.
- The Response Coordinator and the WHO Incident Manager in Butembo traveled to Vuhovi to offer their condolences and encourage health professionals in the area to resume the response activities. Health workers have asked that the coordination be sure to increase their security to protect them against the attacks of the uncivil who sow terror in this country. Contrary to certain information that has circulated, the patients of the Vuhovi General Reference Hospital have not been removed and they continue to be cared for onsite.

Vaccination
-----------
- Vaccination of front-line providers has started on a preventive basis in the Lolwa Health Zone between Komanda and Rwampara on the road connecting Beni to Bunia.
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 82 144 people were vaccinated. [See the source URL above for numbers vaccinated per township.]

[2] Summaries
- Thu 21 Feb 2019. Ebola virus -- DR Congo as of 21 Feb 2019
[WHO Disease Outbreak News, abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/21-february-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak is continuing with moderate intensity. Katwa and Butembo remain the major health zones of concern, while simultaneously, small clusters continue to occur in various geographically dispersed locations. During the past 21 days (30 Jan to 19 Feb 2019), 79 new cases have been reported from 40 health areas within 12 health zones (see Fig. 1 at the source URL), including Katwa (46), Butembo (15), Kyondo (4), Vuhovi (4), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Biena (1), Mabalako (1), Manguredjipa (1), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Rwampara (1).

No new cases have been reported from the Beni in the past 3 weeks [but note in the MoH 22 Feb 2019 report that a case was detected in Beni after 23 days without cases. - Mod.LK]. This is a significant achievement given the previous intensity of the outbreak in this area. Elsewhere, trends in the case incidence (see Fig. 2 at the source URL) have been encouraging; however, other indicators (such as the continued high proportion of community deaths, persistent delays in case detection, documented local travel among many cases, and relatively low numbers of cases among contacts under surveillance) suggest a high risk of further chains of transmission in affected communities. Response teams must maintain a high degree of vigilance across all areas with declining case and contact tracing activity, as with areas with active cases, to rapidly detect new cases and prevent onward transmission.

As of 19 Feb 2019, 848 EVD cases (783 confirmed and 65 probable) have been reported, of which 57% (485) were female and 30% (258) were children less than 18 years of age. Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 119 of 301 health areas across 19 health zones. Ongoing cleaning of case databases this past week corrected the number of deaths and survivors discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) thus far; overall 529 deaths (case fatality ratio, 62%) and 257 survivors have been reported to date.

To complement ongoing response activities, the Ministry of Health is establishing a Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma. The new centre will support the coordination and monitoring of the operations in close collaboration with sub-coordination teams working across all affected areas. The implementation of the Strategic Coordination Centre in Goma will not impact on the response capacity in the field, with WHO and partners continuing to maintain full-scale operations in Beni, Butembo and Bunia, as well as a strong presence in all affected health zones, to ensure the effectiveness of field operations.

Figure 1 (at the source URL) shows confirmed and probable EVD cases by health area, North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo, data as of 18 Feb 2019. Figure 2 (also at the source URL) shows confirmed and probable EVD cases by week of illness onset, data as of 19 Feb 2019.

- Thu 21 Feb 2019. Vuhovi : More Ebola in DRC as nurse's murder halts efforts
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/02/more-ebola-drc-nurses-murder-halts-efforts-vuhovi
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

The Ministry of Health detailed the temporary halting of surveillance activities in Vuhovi after a nurse from the Bisongo health center was abducted and murdered. Officials said a group of unidentified people carried out the attack.

"Contrary to certain information that has circulated, the patients of the Vuhovi General Reference Hospital have not been [removed], and they continue to be cared for on site," the health ministry said, adding that it is encouraging health workers to resume outbreak activities.

New vaccination campaign
---------------------------
Today [21 Feb 2019] front-line workers in the Lolwa health zone, which lies between Komanda and Rwampara on the road connecting Beni to Bunia, were vaccinated in a preventive effort, the ministry said.

Also today [21 Feb 2019], the World Health Organization (WHO) published an outbreak update and noted that Katwa and Butembo remain areas of concern.

From 30 Jan to 19 Feb 2019, a total of 40 health areas in 12 health zones recorded 79 cases: Katwa (46), Butembo (15), Kyondo (4), Vuhovi (4), Kalunguta (2), Oicha (2), Biena (1), Mabalako (1), Manguredjipa (1), Masereka (1), Mutwanga (1), and Rwampara (1).

Survival trend for favipiravir recipients
--------------------------------------
In research news, today [21 Feb 2019] the Journal of Infectious Diseases published a retrospective study on survival rates of Ebola patients who received favipiravir in Guinea during the West African Ebola outbreak in 2015. Favipiravir, also known as T-705 or Avigan, is an experimental antiviral drug manufactured by Toyama Chemical of Japan.

In the study, the case fatality rate in favipiravir-treated patients was lower than in untreated patients (31 of 73 [42.5%] vs 52 of 90 [57.8%], P = 0.053 in univariate analysis), but the effect did not reach statistical significance.

[3] Vaccine: Updated recommendations on the use of Ebola vaccine
Date: Thu 21 Feb 2019
Source: SAGE/WHO [edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/02/who-updated-recommendations-on-the-use-of-ebola-vaccine.html

Following a series of consultations and review of the evidence, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, an independent advisory group convened by WHO, has provided updated recommendations on the use of Ebola vaccine.

The SAGE conclusions and recommendations can be summarized as follows:
1. Ring vaccination (vaccination of contacts and contacts of contacts) and geographic targeted vaccination continue to be the recommended strategies for Ebola vaccination with rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine.
2. Consideration should be given to assessing one or more of the 3 other new Ebola vaccines (experimental or licensed but currently without data on efficacy) in areas neighboring the affected areas, and pregnant and breastfeeding women should be included in these trials.
3. In line with the committee's assessment of October 2018, SAGE welcomes the DRC Ethics committee's recommendation to authorize the use of rVSV-ZEBOV-GP vaccine in pregnant women in outbreak affected areas.

Research in context
Evidence before the study
---------------------------
We did a systematic review of Ebola virus seroprevalence surveys. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles published between 1 Dec 2013, and 31 Dec 2018, using the keywords "Ebola" AND "Meliandou" OR "Guinea". We selected articles collecting data or describing events at the index site of the outbreak. No language restrictions were used. Despite extensive diagnostic, molecular, and phylogenetic research into the transmission of Ebola virus during the 2013-16 west African outbreak, no quantitative study or diagnostic methods have been used at the suspected index location of Meliandou village in Gueckedou prefecture of southeastern Guinea. Previous studies in this area, conducted during the outbreak, were necessarily limited and did not include serological investigation. Past studies on Ebola virus spillover events in other locations have relied on immunoassays with questionable specificity. During the west African outbreak, a new high specificity capture assay capable of detecting anti-Ebola virus immunoglobulins from oral fluid samples demonstrated the occurrence of mild and asymptomatic infections, and facilitated noninvasive serological studies with high population coverage.

Added value of the study
---------------------------
This study provides the 1st evidence of Ebola virus-infected survivors from the index site of the west African outbreak. A thorough retrospective epidemiological study done concomitantly among the resident adult population also greatly expands our understanding of the initiating events including transmission dynamics, probable transmission chains, lower case fatality rates, and the presence of both mild and asymptomatic cases.

Implications of all the available evidence
-------------------------------------
Our conclusions highlight the importance and potential of deploying appropriate quantitative serological tools. The acceptability and specificity of this approach alongside careful epidemiological investigation provide comprehensive understanding of transmission dynamics in Meliandou. These data thoroughly characterise the initiating events of an Ebola virus outbreak and show that it spread further within this community than previously appreciated. They also show that it is possible to access a large proportion of a deeply affected community by building up trust and using an acceptable and noninvasive approach.

The genesis of the Ebola virus outbreak in west Africa http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30055-6 published online 21 Feb 2019. An excerpt follows:

"In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Joseph WS Timothy and colleagues present a brilliant piece of epidemiological sleuthing. By combining classic field investigations with an assay that can measure Ebola virus antibodies in oral fluid, the authors have improved our understanding of the early development of the outbreak in Meliandou. They show that there was almost double the number of individuals infected with Ebola virus (21 cases vs the 11 cases previously reported), and the case fatality was 55·6%." - Mod.LK
