The Pasteur Institute of Cambodia has been involved in the investigation of
the poisoning of schoolchildren and teachers that occurred in Kampot, Cambodia.
Large gram-positive spore-forming rods were isolated from 1/1 stool sample,
3/4 samples of vomit of schoolchildren, and 5/10 food remains (up to 3 500
000 cfu/g in the steamed rice), these bacteria displaying the
characteristics of _Bacillus cereus_.
Moreover, bacteriological analysis of water supplied in the school revealed
it was not drinkable (fecal coliforms: 18 cfu/ml) and contained _Salmonella
enterica_ group C.
Clinical symptoms were mainly nausea, vomiting, and dizziness, without
fever, beginning within 2 hours after the breakfast was served in the
school, corresponding to the emetic type of food poisoning typically caused
by _B. cereus_.

[The following is extracted from an abstract of a recent review paper by JL
McKillup:
"_B. cereus_ produces 2 distinct types of foodborne illness, the emetic
(vomit-inducing) syndrome, associated with consumption of toxin in cooked
rice dishes, and the diarrheal illness seen occasionally following
consumption of contaminated meats, sauces, and certain dairy products. In
the latter case, illness results from the production of enterotoxins by
vegetative cells in the small intestine of the host."
Reference: McKillup, JL, 2000. Prevalence and expression of enterotoxins in
_Bacillus cereus_ and other _Bacillus_ spp., a literature review. Antonie
Van Leeuwenhoek 77(4): 393-399.
It now appears that this outbreak represents a classic case of emetic
syndrome caused by consumption of pre-formed _Bacillus cereus_ toxin which
was present in the rice dish consumed by students and their teachers. -
