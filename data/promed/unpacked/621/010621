Rabies-like Infection in Scotland
---------------------------------
A human case of European Bat Lyssavirus (EBL) 2 infection in Scotland
in November 2002 was confirmed by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency
in November 2002 (1). This is the first confirmed human infection of
EBL 2 in the United Kingdom (UK), and the first human rabies-like
infection acquired in the UK since 1902 (2). The man who became
infected was admitted to hospital with an acutely progressing
neurological illness and died on 24 Nov 2002 (3). The suspicion of a
rabies-like illness arose because the clinical presentation was
compatible with rabies and because the man was a licensed bat handler
who had been bitten by bats on several occasions in Scotland,
including once during the period of incubation before he developed
this illness. He had not travelled abroad recently to countries where
rabies is endemic. The patient had not received rabies immunisation
before or after exposure to bat bites.
This is the fourth confirmed human EBL infection in the world and
only the second one with EBL 2 (4, 5, 6). The 3 human cases reported
previously occurred in the Ukraine in 1977 and in Finland and Russia
in 1985. All 3 previous cases have been in people who had been in
close contact with bats. The 2 cases in the former Soviet Union were
EBL 1 infections in children who had been bitten by bats (7, 8, 9,
10). The case in Finland occurred in a bat handler and was the only
previous recorded case of EBL 2 infection. None had received pre- or
post-exposure vaccination. The clinical presentations were similar to
classical rabies, and all 4 cases were fatal.
Prior to the recent diagnosis of rabies-like infection in Scotland, 2
EBL2 infections have been confirmed in bats in the UK, one in
Newhaven on the southern coast of England in 1996 (11) and another in
Lancashire in 2002 (12). Both of these bat rabies cases were in the
same species, the Daubenton's bat (_Myotis daubentonii_). It was
thought in 1996 that the bat might have migrated from continental
Europe. However, the finding of the 2002 Lancashire bat case well
away from mainland Europe and of an infection confirmed in a bat
handler is more consistent with EBL being now endemic in UK bats,
although probably at very low levels (13). The Veterinary
Laboratories Agency in the UK tests about 200 bats every year for
this virus and has not so far identified EBL in any bats other than
the 2 cases in 1996 and 2002 (14).
EBL 1 and 2 are rabies-like viruses that are carried by insectivorous
bats in Europe. They are from the same family of viruses [the
_Rhabdoviridae_] as cause terrestrial rabies and bat rabies in the
Americas and Australia, [and are classified in the genus]
_Lyssavirus_, but differ in genotype and serotype. In a global
context, classical rabies remains a greater public health burden than
EBL, with 30 000 to 50 000 deaths per year. A person dies from this
infection somewhere in the world every 15 minutes (15). The European
region has had success in controlling terrestrial rabies,
particularly in countries of the European Union, where post-exposure
prophylaxis can be afforded (unlike in many countries where rabies is
highly endemic). Control measures equivalent to those used
successfully for terrestrial rabies have not been developed for EBL
infection in bats. EBL 1 and 2 continue to present a small risk to
human health in countries in Western Europe that are otherwise
rabies-free.
(<http://www.who-rabies-bulletin.org/q2_2002/startq2_02.html>)
Between 1977 and 2000, 630 cases of EBL infection in bats were
reported in Europe, most of which were EBL 1. They occurred in a
number of countries including Denmark, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, and Spain (16). Although levels of EBL 1 infection in
bats have increased in recent years in Europe, EBL 2 infections have
remained rarer than EBL 1.
The different rabies-like viruses and the different bat species found
in Europe distinguish this region from the Americas, where the risk
of rabies is higher following human contact with bats (17) [All
bat-associated rabies cases in North America have been caused by
transmission of genotype 1 rabies virus; i.e., classical rabies
virus, and not by rabies-like viruses similar to EBL 1 and 2. -
Mod.CP]. EBL 1 and 2 do not seem to transmit readily to other
species, hence the rarity of human infections. It is very rare for
other animals to be infected even in countries or regions where bat
rabies occurs, with the total of EBL 1 infections reported in
terrestrial mammals, comprising 4 Danish sheep and one German stone
marten (18,19). There is no appreciable risk of EBL infection
occurring in domestic pets such as dogs and cats, nor in wild
terrestrial mammals in the UK, ensuing from the isolation of EBL 2 in
UK bats.
Bats present virtually no risk to the general public and are
protected by European and some national law, so if a member of the
public comes across a bat they should not touch the bat but seek
help. In the UK a voluntary group, The Bat Conservation Trust, can be
approached through the UK Bat Helpline on +44 845 130 0228 or
information obtained from their website:
(<http://www.bats.org.uk/bat_info.htm>)
Advice regarding bats in the UK changed following the case of bat
rabies in Lancashire. Only licensed or volunteer bat handlers should
routinely come into contact with bats, when they should take care and
wear bite-proof gloves. The Department of Health advice is that all
bat handlers, whether licensed or not, should be vaccinated
preventatively (20). Vaccine is provided free of charge to all bat
handlers in England and Wales by the Public Health Laboratory
Service. This is an amendment to previous advice, which limited free
provision of vaccine to licensed bat handlers (21).
Recent events have also led to a change in policy for management of
people who have had close exposure to bats in the UK. Prophylaxis for
exposure to EBL is the same as that recommended for all potential
rabies virus exposures and appears to be highly effective (22).
Anyone who has been scratched or bitten by a UK bat, or whose eyes,
broken skin or mucous membrane has come into contact with bat saliva
or neural tissue from a UK bat, should be offered post-exposure
vaccination as soon as possible after the incident. If the person is
fully immunised against rabies, they should be offered 2 doses of
vaccine. If they are previously unimmunised or incompletely
immunised, they should be offered 5 doses of vaccine. For those who
are previously unimmunised, and who have been bitten by a bat that is
known, or strongly suspected, to be rabid, then immunoglobulin may be
offered in addition to a full course of vaccine (23). Public health
authorities in all other countries should note the change of policy
so that returning travellers who report exposure to bats in the UK
are offered prophylaxis if appropriate.
Although the vaccine is based on classical (genotype 1) strains of
rabies virus, there is cross-immunity between genotype 1 and genotype
5 (EBL1) and genotype 6 (EBL2) strains (24). Vaccine failures are
extraordinarily rare if the appropriate regimen is followed (25). The
Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, and Spain have been detecting EBL 1
and 2 infections (nearly always EBL 1) in their bat populations for
several years and offer vaccine, and rabies immunoglobulin where
indicated, following bat exposures such as bites or scratches. Over
the last 2 decades several hundreds of people in the Netherlands have
been vaccinated with genotype 1 rabies virus vaccines after a bite of
an EBL-positive bat, but an EBL infection in a human being has never
been confirmed in the Netherlands (Wim H.M. van der Poel, Viral
Zoonoses and Foodborne Virus Infections, Microbiological Laboratory
for Health Protection, RIVM National Institute of Public Health and
the Environment, The Netherlands. Personal communication 20 Nov
2002). There is no evidence to suggest that EBL 1 or 2 differ from
classical rabies in being incurable but completely preventable
infections (26).
