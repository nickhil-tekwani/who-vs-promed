Anthrax hits China as pig disease festers
---------------------------------------------
Anthrax has killed one person and infected 12 in northeast China,
state media reported on Sunday [7 Aug 2005], in the latest outbreak
of animal-borne disease to hit the country in recent weeks. Anthrax,
a disease caused by spore-forming bacteria normally contracted
through contact with infected livestock, struck on 29 Jul 2005
outside Shenyang, in Liaoning province, Xinhua news agency said on
its Web site
<http://www.xinhuanet.com>.
By Friday [5 Aug 2005], no new cases had been reported in the town of
Damintun for 5 consecutive days, and the lives and work of people in
the area have returned to normal, Xinhua said. 11 victims had been
treated in the hospital and were recovering, it said.
Livestock in the affected areas had been inoculated with anti-anthrax
vaccine or culled and safely buried, it said. Local officials had
carefully checked all local meat sales points and banned people from
bringing sick animals to markets. Echoing an ongoing outbreak of a
pig disease that has killed at least 39 people in southwestern China,
all the victims in Damintun were infected through slaughtering,
handling or eating infected cows.
One new death and 2 more infections of the swine-borne bacteria
_Streptococcus suis_ were reported on Saturday [6 Aug 2005] in
Sichuan province, Xinhua said. China has repeatedly insisted the
disease is under control.
