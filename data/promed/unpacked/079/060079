Bringing up to date the outbreak of dengue in Rio de Janeiro City, up to
7 April 1998 1630 cases were reported, as follows:
Month Cases
------------------
1 118
2 133
3 1339
4 40 [first week]
----
Total 1630

One case of DHF [has been detected]:
Male, 31 years-old, onset on 24 Mar 1998 with fever, rash, petechiae,
myalgia
Blood platelet count: 32,000 and Hto 40.8 29 Mar
" " " 44,000 " 40.7 30 Mar
" " " 69,000 " 33.7 31 Mar
MacElisa IgM positive [i.e. confirmed by dengue antibody test].
There are other suspect cases under investigation but most of them [did
not fit] WHO's criteria, which doesn't mean that there are serious
cases.
In Rio de Janeiro City, to be careful about those cases, we have a
criterion to follow up cases with signs and symptoms of dengue who
present any hemorrhage [and a] platelet count less than 150,000. [Only]
at the end we classify using WHO's criteria. We think WHO's criteria
aren't good for day to day practice.

[The WHO criteria are, indeed, a guide to what could be suspected cases,
to orient their treatment, and to classifying a case when all the
diagnostic information is in. So it now appears that the 3 cases with
low platelet counts plus 2 more from the city in an earlier newspaper
report have not been confirmed in the end - Mod.JW]
