Just as a matter of interest: it is probably a moot point to say that
dingoes are native to Australia.

The dingo seems to be related to the South Asian domestic dog, did
not evolve as part of the fauna system indigenous to Gondwanaland [the
southernmost of 2 supercontinents (the other being Laurasia), made up
of South America, Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica, which
existed from around 300 to 200 million years ago. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ] and
came to Australia at some point with the "1st settlers", albeit not
European. It is estimated that the earliest arrivals of the current
predominant aboriginal peoples goes back 50 000 years but that arrival
of the dogs between 4000 and 10 000 years. It is likely that the
arrival of dingoes did have some impact on some native species
(flightless birds?) and the marsupial devil was no longer part of the
mainland fauna when the 1st European settlers took up residence in
1788.

The use of the word "settlers" in the Science article and morphing
them into one group and impact is what created the confusion. Dingoes
were not present on the island of Tasmania, but European settlers did
consider the Tasmanian devil a pest and killed them where there were
conflicts with livestock producers' aspirations.

So the moderator was not entirely in error as accepted below.

As a point of information I believe it is widely accepted that
dingoes were introduced to mainland Australia by humans several
thousand years ago and that this preceded the extinction of the devil
on the Australian mainland about 3000 years ago. For example there is
a paper on the origin of the dingo obtained from the study of
mitochondrial DNA at http://www.pnas.org/content/101/33/12387.full

[These are most interesting facts regarding the dingo and I
appreciate this contribution and both of the contributors. Thank you.
