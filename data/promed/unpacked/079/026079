[A look at map <http://www.flu.org.cn/map/MapBrowser.aspx?reportId=18>
shows that the outbreaks reported here literally span the width and breadth of
China. The 3 outbreaks in Xinjiang autonomous region are located north of
Tibet, as far west as you can go in Chinese territory. The outbreak in Yunnan
is in south-central China bordering Burma and Viet Nam. Hubei and Shanxi
provinces are right in the middle of China. If you add this wide swath of
geography to previous reports from Liaoning province in the extreme Northeast,
then you have pretty well covered all of China. - Mod.PC]
