Supermarket owner Foodstuffs has confirmed that 2 products sold at its stores may be responsible for a severe outbreak of a gastrointestinal bug. About 127 people have been affected and 38 hospitalized by the _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ outbreak since it 1st appeared in September 2014.

Foodstuffs, the company which owns New World, Pak'n Save and Four Square, said it had viewed the report which named 2 of its products, Pam's fresh express mesclun salad lettuce and Pam's fresh express lettuce, as possible sources. The company is investigating this and did not believe any of the potentially affected products were still on its shelves.

Meanwhile, a Canterbury health official has accused the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) of risking public health over the outbreak. Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Alistair Humphrey said a draft report from Environmental Science and Research (ESR) last week identified lettuce and carrots from a particular supermarket chain as the source.

"Everybody involved in this work, including MPI, ESR, all the public health units and the Ministry of Health, have seen the results of the ESR study, which is quite clear. It is unequivocal, and it does name the types of food that have led to this problem, and it also names one particular product," Humphrey told Radio New Zealand.

He claimed MPI asked public health officials to keep the name of the supermarket and the products involved a secret, but he decided to name the vegetables to protect the public.

"[MPI] felt they should work with the industry rather than naming the foods but, of course, that leaves the New Zealand public slightly at risk, in my view. The problem is we have a regulator of the production of our domestic food who is also responsible for the promotion of the industry itself," he said.

Labour's food safety spokesman, Damien O'Connor, said MPI seemed "more concerned" about protecting the reputation of supermarkets than the health of Kiwi consumers. "MPI either lacks the resources or is incapable of dealing with what should be a relatively minor food safety issue. This will be a concern to our export sectors."

O'Connor said MPI had a conflict of interest between promoting New Zealand products and protecting consumers. "It is time the ministry put Kiwi consumers 1st and publicly released the cause of this nasty bug," he said.

However, MPI deputy director general Scott Gallacher said the initial findings into the outbreak were withheld to avoid causing a public scare with limited information. He admitted lettuce and carrots had been associated with the outbreak in the draft report last week, but the information was "not a slam dunk."

Gallacher said MPI did not want to force consumers into making ill-informed decisions or steer them towards other products that may have been responsible. "It is not a simple situation where we can recall a single product. It is not definitively linked to any one supermarket chain," he said.

He said of 96 affected people who were surveyed, 8 could recall the specific brand. He also said that while 87 people affected by the illness purchased lettuce, only 17 identified a brand asked about in the survey.

Gallacher said MPI would reveal the cause of the outbreak once it was known for certain.

The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) says it still hasn't gotten enough information to name the food products and outlets thought to be responsible for an outbreak of a nasty tummy bug. Last week, the Christchurch medical officer of health blamed bagged vegetables, but MPI insists it still hasn't gotten enough proof.

Bagged lettuces and carrots were initially blamed as the cause of the outbreak of _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_. But a week on since that report was released, the agency leading the investigation says it still doesn't know. "We are unsure whether they are the definitive cause from our perspective," says deputy director general regulation and assurance Scott Gallacher. "The health and wellbeing of consumers is in the uppermost of our minds, and it's the top priority we have."

Mr Gallacher says the reason they haven't established an exact cause is because of the 96 people with the bug that they surveyed, 87 said they'd recently eaten lettuce, but only 17 could identify which brand.

Labour's spokesman for food safety says MPI has been dragging its feet on the investigation and potentially put consumers at risk by not identifying a definitive cause sooner. "If they're putting the interests of the supermarkets 1st, then they've got their priorities wrong," says Damien O'Connor. "They need to look after consumers and the health and wellbeing of them, above all else."

The Canterbury medical officer of health has also criticised the MPI, saying tests indicated bagged carrots and lettuces were to blame, and the public should have been told sooner. But MPI says it won't name names or supermarket chains until it's sure.

"We are absolutely focused on getting to the bottom of what has caused this outbreak and making sure we can provide the clarity to all consumers and all interested parties as soon as we have clear and definitive links," says Mr Gallacher. But the ministry will give no indication when that could be.

[It remains unclear whether the 1st suggested vehicle of bagged carrots and lettuce is indeed the vehicle. With the confusion regarding who ate what brand, perhaps the contamination came before the distribution to different supermarkets. - Mod.LL
