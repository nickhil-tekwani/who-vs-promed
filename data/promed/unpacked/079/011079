Two more people tested positive for leptospirosis at a state government referral laboratory this month [November 2017]. A 36-year-old man of Yerawada and another 46-year-old man, a resident of Link road in Pimpri, tested positive for the disease in the 1st week of November. "Both the patients tested positive at the referral laboratory. Hence, they are confirmed cases. We have directed the health officials of the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations to step up surveillance in the areas where the newly diagnosed patients reside," said a state health official, who refused to be named. About 20 leptospirosis cases have been recorded in Pune city so far this year [2017] -- the highest in past several years, as reported by TOI [Times of India].

[According to the newspaper], Bhavani Peth and Yerawada areas are the worst affected by the disease as maximum cases have been reported from these areas. Anjali Sabne, the assistant medical officer of health (AMoH), Pune Municipal Corporation, said, "We have stepped up surveillance in Yerawada." Anil Roy, the health official of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, could not be contacted for his comment on measures taken in Pimpri to rule out the presence of the bacterial disease.

When TOI had reported the death of a person secondary to leptospirosis on 10 Jul 2017, the civic health officials were clueless about it. It was only after TOI report that the officials initiated surveillance and preventive measures. "Leptospirosis is grossly under-reported because of lack of awareness about it among medical professionals, and difficulties in diagnosis," another state health department official said.

In cities, rodents that infest the sewage system with free living animals act as carriers. Even light showers choke the poorly maintained drainage systems, leading to flooding.

[Pune, considered to be the cultural capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra, with a population of about 3.1 million residents, is the 2nd largest city in Maharashtra and the 9th most populous city in the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune#Museums.2C_parks_and_zoos). Pimpri, located to the North-West of Pune city, is a suburb of Pune and consists of the twin towns of Pimpri and Chinchwad, which are governed by a common municipal body the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation or PCMC (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimpri). Yerwada is a neighborhood of the city of Pune (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerwada).

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide. The disease is transmitted to humans by contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes usually with water or soil contaminated by the urine of infected animals. Carrier animals, e.g., rats, dogs, or cattle, are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Different leptospiral serovars are prevalent in particular geographical regions. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal.

Leptospira can survive for weeks to months in warm, fresh water, or soil flooded with fresh water. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow flooding after heavy rainfall. Pune is subject to heavy rainfall during the monsoon season (July-October) and July is the wettest month of the year.
