DISTEMPER, SLED DOGS - USA (ALASKA)
===================================
Date: Sat, 10 May 1997 10:26:43 -0900
From: afdcd1@UAA.ALASKA.EDU (Dr. David Duffy)

The Anchorage Daily News today (10 May 1997) reports an outbreak of
distemper in Kotzebue, a town of 3,000 people in northwest Alaska. The
first outbreak in ten years, it killed "almost" 300 dogs, primarily sled
dogs, with mortalities of up to 80% in dog yards. Local governments and the
local dog mushers association sent in vaccinations for 1500 dogs in
Kotzebue and surrounding towns. This eventually stopped the outbreak.
Failure to vaccinate and minimal health care of dogs by impoverished owners
appears to have allowed development of a large susceptible population.
Many dog owners practice traditonal Native lifestyles and gain insufficient
cash income to allow them to purchase vaccines.
The contact for the newspaper story was Judi McClain (phone unknown), a
veterinary assistant in Kotzebue.
