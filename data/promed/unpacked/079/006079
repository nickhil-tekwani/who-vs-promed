Background and case histories
-----------------------------
Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), phylogenetic clade B was identified in nasopharyngeal specimens of 2 cases of severe acute flaccid myelitis. The cases were 6 and 5 years-old and occurred in September and November 2014. EV-D68 is increasingly associated with acute flaccid myelitis in children, most cases being reported in the United States. Awareness of this possible neurological complication of enterovirus D68 infection is needed.

An unexpectedly high proportion of children were admitted for severe respiratory infections at the Oslo University Hospital, Ulleval, Norway, during September and October, 2014 [1]. Enterovirus was detected in 66 (22 percent) of 303 samples from children hospitalised with acute respiratory infection, and in 5 of 51 samples received from outpatient clinics. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was verified in 33 of the enterovirus-positive samples from hospitalised patients, and in one of the outpatients.

We report 2 cases of severe acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) associated with EV-D68 infection that occurred in September and November 2014 in Norway.

Analysis and discussion
----------------------
EV-D68 is mainly associated with respiratory disease and was first isolated in California in 1962 from children with airway infection. Until 2009, EV-D68 was rarely isolated. Since then, outbreaks of respiratory disease with EV-D68 have occurred worldwide. EV-D68 infections in the Dutch population is increasing. In autumn 2014, EV-D68 was found in 11 percent of children hospitalised for airway infection in the Oslo region. Of the 34 patients, 32 were younger than 7 years.

During an outbreak of respiratory EV-D68-disease in the US in autumn 2014, 9 children presented with AFM; EV-D68 was detected in 4 of 8 nasopharyngeal specimens. From 2 Aug 2014 to 2 Mar 2015, the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) verified reports of 115 children in 34 US states who developed AFM. These cases are currently being investigated. A single European case of EV-D68-associated AFM is reported. This virus was of clade B, closely related to Dutch, Spanish, and Italian types from 2009 to 2014. From outbreaks in Asia and Australia, enterovirus-71 (EV-A species) is known to cause AFM. However EV-D68 has rarely been reported to cause AFM, and almost never been isolated from CSF [cerebrospinal fluid].

In the 2 AFM cases we report here, the virus was only detected in the early nasopharyngeal specimens, highlighting the importance of obtaining this specimen early. Pleocytosis [increased cell count in CSF], increased intrathecal [in the space under the arachnoid membrane of the brain or spinal cord] IgG index, increased CSF-proteins, spinal grey matter-oedema and denervation on neurophysiology may indicate direct CNS infection and neuron destruction. A causal relation is however not proven since no direct evidence of EV-D68 infection in the CNS has been found. Detection of EV-D68-virus may have been coincidental and due to the high incidence of the virus. However, the 2 cases share striking clinical and imaging similarities and no other pathogen has been detected. Intrathecal EV-D68 antibody detection would be indicative of EV-D68 being the neurotrophic pathogen, however this analysis is not available in our hospital and was therefore not performed.

Sequencing of the VP1 gene obtained from Norwegian cases showed a similar genotype in the AFM case and non-AFM cases. While a statistical increase is difficult to prove for such a rare disease, the authors are of the opinion that there is an increase in AFM cases associated with enterovirus D-68 as has been reported from the US. On basis of our findings we can speculate that this may not be caused by increased neurotrophy in a single genotype, but perhaps due to an increased number of EV-D68-infected individuals. It is possible, however, that mutations in non-VP1 regions are responsible for increased neurotrophy.

As we found an identical VP1-sequence in case 1 and in a child with solely respiratory disease, host-related factors are likely to be of importance for the individual risk of developing AFM. At least 3 different EV-D68 strains were circulating in Norway in the autumn of 2014, suggesting 3 separate introductions. No differences in the partial sequence of the VP1 region were observed between the AFM case and non-AFM cases.

International collaboration is needed to confirm the association between EV-D68 and AFM, and to achieve knowledge on treatment and outcome. It is important to recognise this disease, which may become life-threatening.
