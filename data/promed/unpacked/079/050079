Moisture from a leaky roof and a faulty sprinkler helped salmonella
bacteria grow and contaminate peanut butter at its Georgia plant in
2006, sickening more than 400 people nationwide, ConAgra Foods said
Thu 5 Apr 2007.
ConAgra spokeswoman, Stephanie Childs, said the company traced the
salmonella outbreak to 3 problems at its Sylvester, Ga. plant last
August 2006. The plant's roof leaked during a rainstorm, and the
sprinkler system went off twice because of a faulty sprinkler. The
moisture from those events mixed with small amounts of salmonella
bacteria in the plant that Childs said likely came from raw peanuts
and peanut dust. The plant was cleaned thoroughly, but the salmonella
remained and somehow came in contact with the peanut butter before it
was packaged, she said.
ConAgra recalled all its peanut butter in February 2007, after
federal health officials linked it to cases of salmonella. At least
425 people in 44 states were sickened, and lawsuits have been filed
against the company.

A University of Georgia (UGA) expert says findings about salmonella
at a peanut butter plant show that the bacteria is more common in
peanuts than previously believed. Michael Doyle, who runs UGA's
Center for Food Safety, says food companies should pay attention to
the findings ConAgra Foods released on 5 Apr 2007, about how moisture
helped spread salmonella at its plant in Sylvester. Doyle says
companies should not be complacent about peanut products just because
there has been a long history without problems.
ConAgra plans to develop a new testing procedure to ensure its peanut
butter is safe. Before a February 2007 recall of Peter Pan and other
peanut butter brands made at the plant, none of the company's recent
routine testing had detected salmonella.
