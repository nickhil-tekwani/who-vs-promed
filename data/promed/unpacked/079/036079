The first 3 cases of La Crosse encephalitis have been reported in the last
week, La Crosse County health officials stated on Wed 7 Sep 2005. A 2 year
old boy from Cashton, Wisconsin contracted the mosquitoborne disease and
was hospitalized for 5 days. An 8 year old girl from Westby, Wisconsin was
hospitalized for one day. A 57 year old man from Boscobel, Wisconsin also
was diagnosed with the disease and hospitalized.
Dave Geske, La Crosse County Health Department's mosquito control officer,
said initial tests showed all 3 had the La Crosse strain of the disease.
Encephalitis-carrying mosquitoes were found in containers or tires near the
infected people's homes or places where they often go, Geske said.
The peak time for La Crosse encephalitis is August and September, Geske
said, adding that mosquito activity has picked up significantly in the past
2 weeks, so "from a public health standpoint, this is an important time to
take precautions. When it gets cooler, we often don't think we need to use
mosquito repellent or be concerned about containers and other mosquito
habitat," Geske said.
The encephalitis-carrying mosquitoes usually remain active until the first
couple of killing frosts, Geske added. About a half-dozen encephalitis
cases are reported in the La Crosse area each year. La Crosse encephalitis
is a viral disease that usually affects children ages 6 to 15 and attacks
the central nervous system. Symptoms include fever, headaches, stiff neck,
with seizures occurring in about half the cases.

[La Crosse virus was named after La Crosse, Wisconsin, the place where it
was first described in 1963 and the location of the current human
infections. La Crosse virus is the leading cause of pediatric arboviral
encephalitis in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, there are about 70 human cases annually. La Cross
virus is a mosquito-transmitted virus belonging to the family
_Bunyaviridae_. It is now ranked as a member of the virus species
_California encephalitis virus_.
La Crosse virus is maintained in nature by infection of alternate hosts --
mosquitoes and small mammals. Its main vectors are _Aedes triseriatus_, a
mosquito of woodlands, and small mammals such as chipmunks and squirrels.
These small mammals may become sufficiently viremic to infect hematophagous
mosquitoes.
La Crosse virus is present in the United States to the east of the
Mississippi river, and serological studies indicate that human infections
occur throughout the range of the mosquito vector whose density peaks
between June and September. Human cases of encephalitis are correspondingly
seasonal. La Crosse virus is responsible for the majority of human cases of
encephalitis caused by California encephalitis viruses. La Crosse
encephalitis occurs predominantly in the mid-western states, and children
are at greatest risk. The incubation period is about one week, followed by
a non-specific febrile period and an acute encephalitis which may last up
to 10 days. Although there may be persistent disabilities in a minority of
cases, fatalities are rare. - Mod.CP]
