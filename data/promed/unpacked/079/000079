Cucumber from Spain is suspected source of _Salmonella_ Agona outbreak in Norway, Sweden
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a follow-up on the _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Agona outbreaks in Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands, Norway health authorities report the results of the outbreak investigation show that certain batches of cucumber from a Spanish supplier stand out as a likely source of infection. These batches of cucumber are no longer on the market, and we have therefore not been able to test the product for the outbreak bacteria, said senior advisor at Folkehelseinstituttet (FHI) Heidi Lange. "The outbreak is probably over, but we cannot rule out that more individual cases may appear. We are following the situation closely," she added.

In total, there are 72 people living across the country who have been diagnosed with the gastrointestinal bacterium _Salmonella_ Agona. All fell ill with salmonellosis during a short period, from the end of October 2022 to the beginning of December 2022, with a peak in weeks 45 and 46. Cases with the same outbreak strain have also been reported in Sweden and the Netherlands in the same period. The suspicion had therefore been directed at an imported food product that was available throughout the country, has a relatively short shelf life and was common for many people to eat, said Heidi Lange.

The Institute of Public Health has analyzed over 50 patient interviews and purchase information. The institute has also carried out a case-control study comparing what the infected have eaten with what a random selection of other people have eaten. Almost 90% of those infected report having eaten cucumber the week before they became ill, but since cucumber is commonly eaten in Norway, this product does not show up in the case-control study. In contrast, this study helps to disprove other hypotheses as a source of infection in this outbreak. In addition, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority has carried out extensive tracing work where certain batches of cucumber from a Spanish supplier have been identified as the most likely source of infection.

Bacteria with the same genetic profile have been detected in 58 out of 72 infected people. For the remaining 14 infected, the sequencing results (results from examinations in the laboratory) are not yet clear. The persons live in Viken (18), Vestland (15), Vestfold and Telemark (14), Oslo (8), Innlandet (5), Rogaland (3), Trøndelag (3), Troms and Finnmark (3), Møre and Romsdal (2) and Nordland (1). It is only Agder county that has no registered infected people in the outbreak.

[The outbreak has now been recognized in the Netherlands, and the vehicle for transmission is thought to be Spanish cucumbers. ProMED awaits more information about the scope of this outbreak. A 2018 ProMED post (Salmonellosis, st. Agona - EU: multi-year, multi-country outbreak 20180617.5859609) stated that _Salmonella_ Agona is the 10th most common _Salmonella_ serotype responsible for infections according to EU officials. From 2012 to 2016, there were 26 countries in the EU or the European Economic Area that reported 400 to 581 _S._ Agona cases annually. - Mod.LL
