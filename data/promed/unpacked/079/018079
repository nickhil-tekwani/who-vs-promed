Belarus has taken all the necessary measures to prevent the spread of African swine fever [ASF]. The statement was made by Kazimieras Lukauskas, head of the Regional Representation for Eastern Europe of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), BelTA has learned.

"Belarus represents an example of how the current situation should be responded to. We see great efforts on the part of the Belarus government and the Agriculture and Food Ministry; a lot is being done," remarked Kazimieras Lukauskas. "We would like to borrow Belarus' practices used to fight ASF and offer them to other countries."

The official underlined that securing biological protection is the overriding need for the countries where foci of the disease have been detected. "A farm where swine are kept should be fenced off and locked. No trespassers can be allowed to enter," he explained.

According to Kazimieras Lukauskas, the lack of a vaccine is the largest concern in the fight against African swine fever. OIE has accelerated lab research, with immense finance poured into the effort, but no results have been produced yet. "It is impossible to create a vaccine because the virus mutates very fast. Scientists now believe that a vaccine may be produced in 5 years," he said.

Yet Kazimieras Lukauskas noted that there was no need to panic due to the lack of a vaccine. "We have already faced bird flu and swine flu. There were massive problems. But we have improved methods and can now fight it. I think we will come up with solutions to eradicate African swine fever," he concluded.

On 25 Jul 2013, Kazimieras Lukauskas took part in a meeting of the heads of the veterinary control services of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. The meeting was held for the sake of working out joint measures to fight ASF. The meeting was expected to discuss further interaction with a view to stopping the spread and localizing the disease.

[Belarus submitted an immediate notification to the OIE about its 1st ASF outbreak, in the Grodno oblast (west), on 21 Jun 2013. A 2nd report, submitted on 4 Jul 2013, reported another outbreak, in the Vitebsk oblast, in north west Belarus (ProMED-mail posting 20130705.1808831). A map showing both outbreaks is available at the bottom of the OIE archived report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013736_20130704_172613.pdf.

According to media reports, a 3rd focus of ASF was later suspected by the veterinary office in the Stolbtsy district, Minsk oblast (published by Rosbalt on 12 Jul 2013, http://www.rosbalt.ru/exussr/2013/07/12/1152281.html).

The information on ASF from the District Veterinary Office Stolbtsy was contradicted by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food; see http://www.belta.by/ru/all_news/regions?id=641061 (thanks to Mod.NP).

A later Russian report (21 Jul 2013) indicated that "ASF cases have been registered in 13 Russian regions and 3 districts in Belarus" (ProMED-mail posting 20130725.1845918).

The last follow-up report from Belarus on OIE's WAHID website dates back to 4 Jul 2013. - Mod.AS
