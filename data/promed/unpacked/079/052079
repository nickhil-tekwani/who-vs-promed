[1] International trade, suggested origin of the event

African swine fever (ASF) has continued to expand in the mainland. Following Shenyang City in Liaoning province, Zhengzhou City in Henan province and Lianyungang City in Jiangsu province, the ASF epidemic has spread to Zhejiang province, where 340 pigs died on 3 farms in a breeding area in Yueqing City [see <20180823.5983494>]. Caixin.com reported yesterday [24 Aug 2018] that the source and route of ASF virus entering China is still under investigation; however, there is some evidence and opinions referring the source of the epidemic to Russia, such as genetic tests showing the sequencing results of the Chinese virus being completely consistent with the corresponding sequence of the Russian Irkutsk 2017 strain.

Several ASF epidemics have occurred in the far east of Russia since 2017. Mainland reporters found that Chinese officials have recorded a small amount of pig by-products from a pig-raising company in the Russian epidemic area this month.

In the 20 days from the beginning of this month [August 2018] to the present, the epidemic has spread from the northeastern part of China to the coastal cities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After the outbreak, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs sent a supervision team to Zhejiang, and launched an emergency response mechanism to take measures such as blockade, culling, and disinfection, prohibiting all pigs and susceptible animals and products from being transported into or out of the blockade area. It means that the local epidemic has been effectively controlled.

According to industry insiders, this is the beginning of the Sino-US trade war. China no longer imports US pork, due to its elevated high prices, and bought 240 000 tons of Russian pork. This seriously threatens China's pigs and the safety of the entire pig breeding industry.

According to media sources in Heilongjiang province, ASF was first discovered from the northeast and spread rapidly to the south. Now everyone thinks that trouble comes from Russia, but all departments are dismissing responsibility, and even the official news of importing Russian pigs is blocked. According to the trend of Russian live pig trade prices, starting from 14 Mar 2018, the price of live pigs in Russia has increased by 50%.

China is culling more than 1300 pigs as authorities rush to control a 4th outbreak of African swine fever and try to trace the origins of the virus that 1st struck the world's largest hog herd 3 weeks ago. Authorities in the eastern province of Zhejiang said they would slaughter 1332 hogs and seal off an area within 3 km (1.8 miles) from the pig farming community in the city of Yueqing, where the outbreak was discovered on Thursday [23 Aug 2018]. The local government said in a statement that it had also banned the movement of animals that could be easily infected inside and outside the affected area, and closed some live hog trading markets and slaughterhouses following the outbreak.

The latest cull will bring the total number of pigs deliberately killed to prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease to over 25 000. The discovery and 2 other cases reported in Henan in central China and Jiangsu province to the north of Zhejiang are thousands of kilometers away from the 1st outbreak. That highlights the challenge the government faces in preventing the spread of disease across the nation and into Southeast Asia.

"It is unclear how this disease is moving through the country," said the Swine Health Information Center, a US research body. "It is appearing in a range of farms across swine-dense areas. Trade in pigs, semen and pork products are all possibilities."

The disease is transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals, and can also travel via contaminated food, animal feed and people moving from one place to another. There is no vaccine, but it is not harmful to humans.

The strain that has struck China is similar to the one that has spread across Russia, Georgia and Estonia over the past decade, a senior veterinarian at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) told Reuters on Friday [24 Aug 2018]. An outbreak in Irkutsk in March 2017 marked the disease's first long-jump from central-eastern Europe to eastern Russia, 1000 km (620 miles) from the Chinese border.

In China, experts are still trying to establish the source of the 1st infection in the city of Shenyang in the northeastern province of Liaoning on 3 Aug 2018, said Wantanee Kalpravidh, project regional manager at the FAO's Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases in Bangkok, Thailand.

They have traced the movement of pigs as far back as March [2018], but they have not found evidence of the virus, she said. "It is still very inconclusive. The team in China is still working on it."

The virus that causes African swine fever is hardy and has been shown to remain infectious for at least 30 days in uninhabited pig pens, over 4 months in pork products, including salted dried hams, and indefinitely in frozen pig carcasses, the Swine Health Information Center said. "The hardiness of this virus, along with the fact it is found throughout the pig as well as its faeces and saliva, means these leaps of the disease across large distances are possible."

[The Reuters report above includes a map, titled "African Swine Fever outbreaks across China as of 24 Aug 2018." The map presents 5 African swine fever (ASF) foci: the 4 outbreaks in the provinces Liaoning, Henan, Jiangsu and Zhejiang (in chronological order), officially reported to the OIE since 3 Aug 2018, as well as the location of the live market in Jiamtsu, Heilongjiang province, "where pigs infected in the second outbreak (Henan) came from." The map is available at https://pdf.reuters.com/pdfnews/pdfnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u=2018-08-24T064851Z_GFXEE8O0IXFOB_1_RTRGFXG_BASEIMAGE.png.

The information in item [1], from Hong Kong sources, hints at a possible link between the discontinued/decreased imports of pork from the USA and its replacement by Russian-sourced pork. Similar reports have been spotted in other Chinese media reports (thanks to Sabine Zentis). It is not fully clear if, and how many, live pigs have been introduced, in particular from Russia, into China's adjacent Heilongjiang province, where allegedly the live market was the origin of an infected consignment to Henan. Information on imports since the start of 2018, as well as the current sources of pork imported to China (countries/quantities), will be helpful.

It deserves to be stated that in case imported (frozen or otherwise) pork was the route of introduction, the site of entrance would not necessarily be the northeast part of China.

According to several sources, the actual commencement of the ASF event in China dates several months back, earlier to its eventual detection, identification and reporting in August 2018. A scientific paper (posting <20180815.5967476>) indicated that the disease started on a farm near Shenyang City in Liaoning province in mid-June 2018. Others indicated an earlier start, namely, April 2018 (posting <20180817.5969883>, commentary). The current Reuters report says that movements of potentially infected animals were traced "as far back as March (2018)," but that no evidence of the virus could be found. Failing to detect the virus would not be surprising after such a long period; the issue remains obscure.

The genotyping results of the causative agent, showing homology to the strain circulating in Europe and Russia's Irkutsk province, has been addressed in <20180815.5967476>. Similar findings, obtained by another research team, are included in Reference 1 below.
