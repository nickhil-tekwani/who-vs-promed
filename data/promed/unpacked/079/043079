A rabies outbreak resembling FMD in cattle causes concern in Paraguay
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The officer in charge of Paraguay National Animal Sanitary Service
(SENACSA, Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Animal), Edgard Rodriguez, admitted
that "surveillance is being carried out in an area including San Rafael del
Parana, Artigas and Fram". This report was spread by radio stations in
Encarnacion, which is the capital of Itapua, a city located near Posadas,
but separated from it by the Parana river, indicating that "drooling
animals were found and veterinary services were called for assessing these
animals."
After this 1st report, no other reports were received. The Animal Sanitary
National Service (SENASA) officer in Formosa, Argentina, Mr Enrique Orban,
confirmed that the aforementioned cases were rabies.
Meanwhile, the province director of stockbreeding, Mr Rodolfo Jacquet, was
quite surprised by the news. "There is no official information; however,
according to the comments we heard, the assessed animals had excessive
drooling, which is a symptom related to foot and mouth disease, and there
is no way that this corresponds to any other disease", said the Argentinian
officer.
The chairman of Misiones Rural Society (Argentina), Mr Gerardo
Diaz-Beltran, stated that "we should be alert, because this is an
epidemiological danger for the whole region". He also recommended "to
immediately stop the importation of meat from Paraguay, be it from cattle,
pigs, sheep or goats, until things are completely cleared up, especially
now that we are approaching Christmas holidays and many people cross the
border in order to buy food in Paraguay."
Mr Diaz-Beltran delivered the reminder that stockbreeding in Misiones
includes 350 000 animals and that the 2nd yearly vaccination against FMD
has been successfully completed.
"Markets were closed for us because of problems happening first in Formosa
and afterwards in the Paraguay-Brazil border, [not?] far from here. So we
must be alert, since we are concerned that something similar might occur",
said the chairman. The last cases of FMD in Paraguay were reported in July
2003 in the department of Boqueron, in the El Chaco region, not far away
from the border of the Formosa province and Bolivia.
SENASA supervisor Mr Enrique Orban said to a local radio broadcasting
station, "We contacted SENACSA Paraguayan authorities, and they told us
that they have had problems with rabies leading to paresis, and that in the
last stage of the disease there is drooling, incoordination, and ultimately
death in the animals." He pointed out that Argentinian officers were
invited to go to visit such sites to verify the situation, particularly
next to Posadas.
"We in Argentina have an epidemic because of bats transmitting the
infection, and the Formosa area should carry out vaccinations in order to
control the situation", he stated.
With regard to Decree No. 862 by SENASA, in which the entrance of meat
products to Argentina from Paraguay was authorized, he said that "because
of this unfortunate situation, less than one week ago this decree was
signed; and even though no meat products have entered Argentina yet, it
would be very appropriate [as a measure] to rule out the presence of FMD in
Paraguay and confirm whether rabies is the real problem".
With respect to SENASA current activities, he pointed out that many tasks
were planned, and a very important job is carried out in the western area
and at the border. Now we are discussing the working plan for the next
year." He stated, "I am concerned about the exclusion area at Formosa
(Argentina) where we cannot send meat products, even though the ban on our
products was suspended by the European Union. We want to see if the SENASA
chairman would modify this situation (the exclusion area)".
The chairman for rural institutions from Chaco and Formosa (CHAFOR), Mr
Ricardo Buryaile, pointed out that this report "is quite worrisome, since
if the outbreaks continue, it means danger".
Mr Buryaile said that he is not worried that there are no restrictions for
having meat imported from Paraguay in Argentina. "[Regarding] FMD, if meat
has no bones and is frozen, there is no possibility of transmitting the
infection. If meat is brought with bones, the microorganism can be in a
quiescent phase, and this might be dangerous".
