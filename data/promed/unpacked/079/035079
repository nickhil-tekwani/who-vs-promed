[The above described LSD outbreak is the 5th one reported from Turkey since the reporting of the initial event on 17 Sep 2013 (which reportedly had started on 6 Aug 2013). A report on an additional 3 outbreaks was submitted on 30 Sep 2013. According to the current report, the 5th outbreak is located about 150 km north of the Syrian border (map at http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/44/Malatya.html). The belated reporting, almost 7 weeks after its start, may be indicative of detection of old lesions, skipping the acute phase. According to the report, LSD vaccination has not started yet in Turkey. Have only 3 animals shown clinical disease among 800 unvaccinated, susceptible animals in the affected herd?

For a map of the 2013 LSD situation in the region, subscribers are referred to the OIE map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (select lumpy skin disease and zoom in). Outbreaks which have been recorded during 2013 in Jordan, Israel, Lebanon and Turkey will be shown. It may be assumed that the LSD virus has also been circulating in other countries in the region, particularly in Syria. - Mod.AS
