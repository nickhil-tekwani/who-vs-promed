NM chili yield down due to disease
-----------------------------------
A combination of too much rain, wind, hail, insects, and hungry
animals made it tough for New Mexico's chili farmers -- especially in
Luna County and the Las Uvas Valley in southern New Mexico -- to
produce their fiery crop.

Now that the 2008 harvest has wrapped up, early results indicate the
chili yield is down 20 to 30 percent, said Stephanie Walker,
extension vegetable specialist and chili breeding program researcher
at New Mexico State University.

For the 3rd straight year, excess moisture led to the spread of
bacterial leaf spot, a destructive disease that causes the plant to
lose leaves and not produce peppers.

[Bacterial leaf spot (BLS) is considered the most destructive leaf
disease of capsicum and is caused by _Xanthomonas vesicatoria_
(previously _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _vesicatoria_). There are a
number of strains of the pathogen and some can also affect tomato.
Solanaceous weeds may act as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include
necrotic leaf spots, premature leaf drop, and spotting of stems and
pods resulting in unmarketable fruit. Disease progress can be very
rapid in warm, damp weather and the disease may spread quickly into
neighboring crops.

The bacteria can enter the leaf through stomata and wounds and are
spread by mechanical means, splashing rain and infected materials
such as transplants, plant debris, soil and seed. Under favorable
conditions, one infected seed in 10 000 may lead to 100 percent
infection of plants in a field. Disease management is difficult and
includes use of clean planting material, crop rotation and
preventative bactericidal sprays. Crop cultivars with various levels
of resistance to the different bacterial strains are available, and
cultivars with a general resistance to all strains are being developed.

In New Mexico, BLS epidemics in chili crops resulting in significant
crop losses have been reported previously.
