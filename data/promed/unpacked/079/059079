Kids love petting pigs, goats, and other livestock at fairs and pumpkin patches, but an increase in potentially fatal bacterial infections has officials warning against this activity. According to District Health Department no. 10, cases of human sickness caused by a specific strain of the bacterium, _E. coli_, increased in the summer of 2017 in Mecosta and Newaygo counties.

Dr Jennifer Morse, medical director for 3 local health departments, said "these increases are concerning because the resulting illness can be life-threatening. With the investigations that have been completed thus far, the major source seems to be coming from farm animals."

According to the health department, _Escherichia coli_, commonly called _E. coli_, is one of the most common bacteria on earth. It is found normally in the intestinal tracts of healthy humans and warm-blooded animals. Not all strains of _E. coli_ are capable of causing illness; however, many types of _E. coli_ that cause illness are relatively harmless to the long-term health of infected humans and can cause diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting and a low-grade fever.

One sub-group, represented by _E. coli_ O157:H7, now known as Shiga-toxin producing _E. coli_, or STEC [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ - EHEC], is known to cause more severe human illness. EHEC can lead to kidney disease and occasionally lead to death, with children being most at risk.

Morse said increases in EHEC infection occur every year from spring to fall when more people come in contact with livestock at fairs and other events. These infections are rare and only occur in 1.5 people out of 100 000, according to statewide data from 2012-2016.

This summer [2017], Newaygo County saw a spike in infections, which affected 14 out of 100 000 people, according to health department data. Mecosta also saw a smaller spike, but Morse said what was interesting about the _E. coli_ reports was that they correlated with another spike in infections of a different sort: _Cryptosporidium_, which is a parasite in humans and animals that causes watery diarrhea that can last a few days to a few weeks. Rarely, _Cryptosporidium_ infection can involve and lead to complications in the lungs, gallbladder, and pancreas.

Morse said they were able to determine both infections have been caused by people coming into contact with the feces of farm animals. Such an infection could occur, hypothetically, when a child pets an animal with feces in their fur then puts their fingers in their mouth or eats food before washing their hands. Although no cases have been reported in Wexford, Osceola or Missaukee counties, Morse said people should assume all farm animals could spread the infections.

Michigan State University Extension Educator Jerry Lindquist said people who are regularly in contact with farm animals build up a resistance to infection and usually don't get sick. It is those who haven't built up an immunity who are most at risk of sickness and potentially death. "The risk isn't as great for farm families," Lindquist said. "But it's important for the future of agriculture to allow non-farm members of the community to visit the farm."

Lindquist said more people are choosing to buy farm animals and raise them as a food source for their families. These types of arrangements can lead to family members becoming sick from exposure to germs if they don't take proper precautions. "It can happen when kids are allowed to hug and kiss the animals," Lindquist said.

There are several pumpkin patches in the area that have livestock on display for kids and their parents to check out. Pahl's Pumpkin Patch, in Buckley, has a rule that visitors aren't to touch the animals. Operator Holly Pahl said they are very aware of the risks associated with coming into contact the animals, which is why they have "hand sanitizers everywhere."

According to the health department, these germs, when shed in feces, can survive in soil, water, and other surfaces including concrete, wood, metal, and human skin for a long period of time.

To keep everyone healthy, including the animals, it is important to take the following precautions to make sure you are not exposing yourself to any harmful germs:
- help children avoid kissing or hugging the animals;
- do not eat, drink, or smoke in or around areas where animals are housed;
- keep sippy cups, small toys, and pacifiers secured and put away in animal areas; they often end up on the ground and then back in the mouth of the child;
- do not take baby strollers into animal housing areas. This will prevent the wheels from becoming contaminated and then spreading the contamination to the car or buildings at home;
- upon exiting animal housing areas, utilize provided hand washing stations. If available, wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water but are also acceptable;
- when you return to your home, wash all clothing with hot, soapy water and clean the bottoms of footwear with soapy water, if necessary.

Additionally, it is important that farmers and fair exhibitors keep pens clean and bedded on a regular basis to help reduce the buildup of harmful germs.

[It is not specifically stated what EHEC serotypes were involved, whether any of the cases were epidemiologically related, or if genetic relatedness testing has been done as yet. ProMED would like more information in this regard.

Direct contact with the animals is not required to be infected as the environment around the livestock can be the vehicle for transmission. Indeed, cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) illness have occurred linked to buildings a week or more after a petting zoo had been in them, with the outbreak strain still found in the environment 42 weeks after the event, underscoring the need for adequate decontamination of such sites (Varma JK, Greene KD, Reller ME, et al: An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 following exposure to a contaminated building.
