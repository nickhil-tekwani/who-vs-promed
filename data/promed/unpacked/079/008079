The major cause of meningitis in Africa has changed in recent years, a study published in EBioMedicine and funded by Meningitis Research Foundation has confirmed. A type of bacterial meningitis called MenA (meningococcal group A) has seen huge declines, but now meningococcal groups W, X, and C have risen as major causes of meningitis in the African region known as the meningitis belt [Ref. 1].

The meningitis belt countries of sub-Saharan Africa have been repeatedly devastated by meningitis epidemics since the early 1900s. Fortunately, since the introduction of the vaccine MenAfriVac in 2010, over 300 million 1-29-year-olds living in the meningitis belt countries have been vaccinated against MenA, and there has been a dramatic decline in cases of MenA. However, meningitis caused by other types of meningococcal bacteria are rising, and the disease remains a major public health threat.

In a new study, researchers from the 3 World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centers for Reference and Research on Meningitis, in collaboration with the national laboratories in Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, and Mali, as well as with the Agence de Medecine Preventive, have provided further evidence about the different meningococcal strains that are now causing disease in sub-Saharan Africa, revealing how these bacteria travel between countries.

Professor Dominique Caugant from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, who led the study, said, "We used cutting-edge sequencing technology to study the genetic makeup of over 700 samples of meningococcal bacteria collected from patients with meningitis in the meningitis belt from 2011 to 2016. We've identified that previously circulating strains of MenX, MenW, as well as MenC strains have evolved to become major causes of meningococcal meningitis and are continuing to expand. The new strain of MenC that caused massive epidemics in Niger and Nigeria in 2015 and again in 2017 is continuing to evolve and expand into other countries. Interestingly, this research also revealed that, for some meningococcal strains, there is a geographical split, with 'families' of bacteria causing disease in western Africa forming clusters distinct from those in central Africa. These bacteria are evolving locally and new, and potentially more virulent strains may emerge in a region of the world that has been hit the hardest by meningitis."

Linda Glennie, director of research at Meningitis Research Foundation said, "This research is crucial because we need to understand how these strains evolve and spread to inform how future prevention strategies should best be targeted. It illustrates how whole-genome sequencing methods have revolutionised meningitis surveillance, helping to monitor and predict epidemics, informing vaccine decision-making, and enabling valuable country comparisons to be made. The 1st vaccine expected to protect against 5 types of meningococcal disease -- meningococcal A, C, W, Y, and X -- is currently in development, and, if affordable, this could be key to protecting against all major types of meningococcal meningitis prevalent in the meningitis belt.

"We have always stressed the importance of defeating meningitis and septicaemia around the world, as the disease passes from human to human without respect for national borders. This year we are delighted to be part of the newly established WHO task force to defeat meningitis by 2030."

Abstract
------
"Background. Historically, the major cause of meningococcal epidemics in the meningitis belt of sub-Saharan Africa has been _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A (NmA), but the incidence has been substantially reduced since the introduction of a serogroup A conjugate vaccine starting in 2010. We performed whole-genome sequencing on isolates collected post-2010 to assess their phylogenetic relationships and inter-country transmission.

"Methods. A total of 716 invasive meningococcal isolates collected between 2011 and 2016 from 11 meningitis belt countries were whole-genome sequenced for molecular characterization by the 3 WHO Collaborating Centers for Meningitis.

"Findings. We identified 3 previously reported clonal complexes (CC): CC11 (n = 434), CC181 (n = 62), and CC5 (n = 90) primarily associated with NmW, NmX, and NmA, respectively, and an emerging CC10217 (n = 126) associated with NmC. CC11 expanded throughout the meningitis belt independent of the 2000 Hajj outbreak strain, with isolates from Central African countries forming a distinct sub-lineage within this expansion. Two major sub-lineages were identified for CC181 isolates, one mainly expanding in West African countries, and the other found in Chad. CC10217 isolates from the large outbreaks in Nigeria and Niger were more closely related than those from the few cases in Mali and Burkina Faso.

"Interpretations. Whole-genome-based phylogenies revealed geographically distinct strain circulation as well as inter-country transmission events. Our results stress the importance of continued meningococcal molecular surveillance in the region, as well as the development of an affordable vaccine targeting these strains."

The "African meningitis belt" is the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa, where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. A map of the African meningitis belt can be found at http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2016/02/africa-notes-success-meningitis-vaccine-some-others. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A had been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the prior 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C, which require a change in meningococcal vaccine strategy. - Mod.ML
