Farmers in eastern Uganda have appealed for the government's
intervention following an outbreak of a cattle disease. The disease
has affected Kumi, Ngora and Soroti districts, Kumi Veterinary
doctor, Simon Peter Arionga said.

The disease, which the doctor attributes to Ciprox virus, leaves the
animals with a lumpy skin. He said the disease causes fever and
nodules on the skin; lumps appear on the bodies of affected animals
which later turn into deep wounds. If not treated fast, the ailment
can result in deaths of the animals.

Dr Arionga said that the disease is caused by Capripox virus, which
was 1st discovered in Zambia in 1929.

He said the disease causes loss of appetite, discharge of saliva and
a grey discharge from the eyes. Dr Arionga identified the worst hit
sub-counties as Kapir, Kobuin in Ngora, Nyero in Kumi and Gweri in
Soroti. "There is need to isolate the sick animals from those that
have not yet contracted the disease," he said.

He added that the disease causes economic problems among cattle
keepers because milk production decreases, with weight loss, retarded
growth and damage to the hides.

Dr Arionga, who said there is need for massive vaccination of cattle,
said the disease can also be transmitted by insects. Mr Julius Ebaju,
a cattle keeper at Kapir communal grazing field in Kapir Sub-county,
said 20 head of cattle have already died because of the illness.

"We are trying to treat the animals using local herbs, but we have
failed to contain the disease," Mr Ebaju said. He said he gets dead
carcasses at their grazing fields daily.

[Though lumpy skin disease (LSD) is regarded to be endemic in Uganda,
the most recent quantitative data, available from OIE's WAHID system,
dates back to 2005 (7 outbreaks in 5 provinces). Since then, Uganda
reported that the disease was suspected but not confirmed. Official
information on the current reported outbreak would be appropriate,
preferably lab confirmed.

OIE's LSD world distribution map for 2009 is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=disease_status_map&disease_type=Terrestrial&disease_id=7&empty=999999&disease_serotype=0&sta_method=semesterly&selected_start_year=2009&selected_report_period=1&selected_start_month=1&page=disease_status_map&date_submit=OK>.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD, knopvelsiekte) is a pox disease of cattle
characterised by fever; nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and
internal organs; emaciation; enlarged lymph nodes; oedema of the
skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance
because it causes reduced production, particularly in dairy herds. It
also causes damage to the hide. LSD is caused by strains of
capripoxvirus that are antigenically indistinguishable from strains
causing sheep pox and goat pox. However, LSD has a different
geographical distribution to sheep and goat pox, suggesting that
cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between
sheep and goats.

Transmission of LSD virus is thought to be predominantly by insects,
natural contact transmission in the absence of insect vectors being
inefficient. Until 1988, LSD was confined to sub-Saharan Africa, but
in 1988 spread into Egypt, where it has become endemic. So far, LSD
has been laboratory-confirmed only in 2 countries outside Africa,
Israel and Reunion.

The 1st outbreak in Israel occurred in 1989, most probably
originating from Egypt. It was eradicated by stamping out and ring
vaccinations. The disease recurred in Israel in 2006 (one outbreak)
and 2007 (7 outbreaks), all resolved by "modified stamping out" and
ring vaccination. In Reunion, LSD was diagnosed in 1993; Reunion, one
of the overseas territories of France, politically a part of the
Eurozone, is an island in the Indian ocean, 200 km from Mauritius. An
outbreak was reported in Bahrain, another ex-African country, in 1993
but was not confirmed by virus isolation. There was also an outbreak
in 2000 in cattle imported into Mauritius; the diagnosis was
confirmed by electron microscopy.

Further information concerning LSD diagnosis and vaccines is
available at
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.04.14_LSD.pdf>. In case
mass vaccination is applied during the disease season, special
attention should be paid to avoid spread of the virus between
vaccinated farms by frequent change of the syringe needles.
