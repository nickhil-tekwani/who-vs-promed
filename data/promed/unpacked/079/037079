SOME arthropods (and a very limited range), surely?? VERY sweeping
statement!!

Thank you for the query from Dr. Rybicki reference my statement
that it is unlikely that Ebola virus replicates in arthropods. Although
we only tested a relatively few species, we exposed them to Ebola virus
by intrathoracic (mosquitoes) or intracoelomic (ticks) inoculation. This
procedure bypasses most known barriers to infection. Nearly all of the
arboviruses that I am aware of will replicate in at least one of the
species tested if exposed by this route.
As indicated in my earlier communication, we hope to examine additional
arthropods in the not too distant future.
I've sent a copy of the above directly to Dr. Rybicki.
Mike
