Immediate steps have been taken by the State Health and Medical
Department to control a malaria outbreak in Bario Highlands.

"I was made to understand that there are 2 settlements of Penan
community having been affected by the outbreak, which was detected on
28 Jul 2008," said Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Dr
George Chan when contacted by The Borneo Post yesterday [1 Aug 2008].
"However, I am still waiting for the official report on the exact
number of settlements and the people effected by malaria," Dr Chan
said.

Dr Chan, who is also the State Disaster Management and Relief
Committee chairman, believed that they would be able to control the
outbreak from spreading further, as measures such as a pool of
medical personnel from Marudi, Kuching and Miri had been flown into
the highlands.

Ba Kelalan assemblyman Nelson Balang Rining when contacted said he
believed that the disease might have been brought in by semi-nomadic
Penan squatting on the fringe of Arur Dalam, after they visited Long
Semirang.

Nelson, who just came from the highlands, disclosed that the initial
report from medical officers said 21 people were down with
vector-borne disease, the majority from an area near Arur Dalan. The
number could be more in Long Semirang, where the disease is believed
to have originated.

"According to medical officers in the highlands, the outbreak among
the Penan community living near Arur Dalan might be brought by
someone from there who visited someone he knew in Long Semirang," he
said, adding that the finding was made after interviews conducted
with the people living in Arur Dalan. Arur Dalan is about 30 km from
Long Semirang, which takes around one day of walking to reach. This
causes the presumption that the malaria outbreak in Semirang and Arur
Dalan could be interrelated.

Nelson said Long Semirang would be very hard to reach as there was no
road. This made it hard for the medical personnel to know the exact
level of the outbreak in Long Semirang. They might need a helicopter
to fly them in.

"The outbreak, at the moment, only affects the Penan community living
near Arur Dalan. The state Health and Medical Services Department has
taken various steps and measures to curb malaria from spreading
further," said Nelson. Fogging exercises, distribution of
anti-mosquito insecticide, anti-malaria medicine and distribution of
mosquito nets have been carried out.

"The anti-malaria operations will be carried out in the Penan
settlements hit by the malaria outbreak, including the villages
surrounding the infected areas or settlements. Fogging exercises have
been carried out, and the local community there will be given free
mosquito nets," said Nelson.

Apart from the locals working in the surrounding jungles, visitors
entering the infected settlement would need to go through health
screening. Nelson reminded the local community in the highlands to
destroy mosquito breeding grounds such as in drains and containers
and by cleaning their areas. They should also be always on the alert
for those showing signs of malaria-infection.

The infected Penans are now being given treatment in hospitals in
Miri and Marudi, and also a clinic in Bario. It is reported that all
of those infected are adults including 3 pregnant women.

[We presume that the outbreak is caused by _P. falciparum_, although
not stated in the article. The recent description of human _P.
knowlesi_ infections also comes from Borneo, and this is another
possibility. A recent study found that _P. knowlesi_ DNA was detected
in 27.7 percent of the samples from Sarawak hospitals (Cox-Singh J et
al _Plasmodium knowlesi_ malaria in humans is widely distributed and
potentially life threatening. Clin Infect Dis. 2008;46:165-71).

There is no indication of what caused the outbreak, perhaps a surge
in the vector population due to increased breeding. Another
possibility is human migration of people with malaria from Indonesian
Borneo.

The latest data on malaria in Malaysia provided by the WHO is from
2003 and can be found at
<http://rbm.who.int/wmr2005/profiles/malaysia.pdf>.

In 2003, Malaysia reported 6338 malaria cases with 21 deaths, 2884
_P. falciparum_ or mixed and 3127 _P. vivax_ cases.

Bario is located in Sarawak (Malaysia) close to the border of
Indonesian Borneo; see:
