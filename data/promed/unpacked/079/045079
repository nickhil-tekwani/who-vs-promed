Abstract
--------
We describe a case of community-acquired pneumonia due to _Chlamydia caviae_ in a patient with no direct animal exposure, raising questions about the zoonotic reservoirs and potential transmission routes. Genotyping of _Chlamydia_ isolates that cause pneumonia should be performed for a precise diagnosis and to initiate adequate infection control measures.

[_Chlamydia caviae_ is an obligate intracellular bacterial parasite that causes conjunctivitis in guinea pigs and is not invasive. _C. caviae_ had not previously been known to cause infection in humans, but 3 otherwise healthy adults in their early 30s in the Netherlands were reported last year [2017] to have developed community-acquired pneumonia due to this organism after contact with sick pet guinea pigs (1). The pet guinea pigs were ill with respiratory symptoms in 2 of the patients and conjunctivitis and rhinitis in the 3rd patient.

Pneumonia was sufficiently severe in 2 of the 3 patients to require mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU); all 3 survived following treatment with doxycycline. They were treated at different hospitals and were from different geographic areas in the Netherlands.

_Chlamydia_ DNA was detected in specimens obtained from the respiratory tract, serum, or both in all 3 patients, and speciated by sequencing a part of the chlamydial gene that encodes the outer membrane protein A (1). The genotype in one of the patients matched the genotype of _C. caviae_ isolated from the patient's pet guinea pig.

Although the 3 patients reported in the New England Journal of Medicine article had contact with ill pet guinea pigs, the patient in the above journal article submitted by Greg Folkers reportedly did not have direct animal exposure. Both journal articles are from Dutch investigations who likely were able to identify _C. caviae_ in clinical specimens because of the Dutch national surveillance system for psittacosis, in which samples identified as positive in a polymerase-chain-reaction assay are genotyped by sequencing a part of the gene that encodes the outer membrane protein A, ompA (1). The frequency that _C. caviae_ causes community-acquired pneumonia in the Netherlands, as well as in other countries, and its sources in patients without animal exposure are unknown and will require further investigation.
