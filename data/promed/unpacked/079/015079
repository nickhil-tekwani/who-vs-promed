[Information published by the Pirbright World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease, shows that the following serotypes have been identified in Palestinian Authority:

Serotype: Years
Untyped: 2007, 2009
FMDV-O: 2002, 2007, 2013 (West Bank), 2015 (West Bank), 2017 (Gaza Strip)
FMDV-A: 2009, 2013 (Gaza Strip)
FMDV-C: 0000
FMDV-Asia 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 1: 0000
FMDV-SAT 2: 2012 (Gaza Strip)
FMDV-SAT 3: 0000
See data at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/pat.htm. - Mod.CRD

Since February 2017, 4 FMD events, totaling 10 outbreaks, have been reported from a restricted area in the Eastern Mediterranean, including the Palestinian Authority (PA; 2 in the Gaza Strip, 2 in the West Bank); Israel (one, adjacent to the Gaza strip, and a recent one on the Lebanese border); and Jordan (4 widely spread outbreaks, in February 2017, declared resolved in April). For all 10 outbreaks, please refer to the map at http://tinyurl.com/nx266ce (click on Israel/PA, zoom in).

The following information is currently available on the strains involved:

1. FMD serotype O topotype EA-3 in the Gaza strip (PA; 2 reported outbreaks) and in one adjacent Israeli farm, total of 3 reported outbreaks in the cluster;

2. FMD serotype O, not-genotyped, in Jordan: 4 outbreaks, of which one in the north (close to Syria), 2 in the northwest (close to the Jordan river/PA), and one in the center;

3. FMD serotype A, serotyped/genotyped (in Israel) as A/ASIA/GVII, on the Lebanese border (north Israel).

4. FMD (untyped), West Bank (PA), 2 outbreaks (this is the new, current event reported to the OIE above).

Though starting at the same date as event No 3 (Israel, FMD A/ASIA/GVII, on Lebanon's border, rather distant from the West Bank), the causative agent in the current West Bank event could be similar to any of the 3 strains circulating regionally, including the Jordanian one.

Unfortunately, Jordan's FMDV-O strain has not been genotyped yet. Jordan's neighbor, Saudi Arabia, has recently experienced outbreaks caused by 2 FMDV serotype O strains, namely ME-SA/Ind-2001d and ME-SA/PanAsia-2ANT-10.

Hopefully, the West Bank samples be forwarded to a (regional/global) FMD reference laboratory for serotyping and genotyping, and the Jordanian strain be genotyped. - Mod.AS
