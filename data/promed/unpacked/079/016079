As of today [Sun 6 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
1683 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
683 deaths [reported case fatality rate 40.6 per cent],
988 recoveries, and
12 currently active cases/infections.

[As previously mentioned, the numbers of deaths, recoveries and currently active cases come from my spreadsheet tallies and differ from those listed on the Saudi MOH website; my spreadsheet counts asymptomatic infections. One complication is the reporting of cases as either recoveries or deaths that cannot be confirmed as previously reported newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

Since the last ProMED-mail update [Wed 2 Aug 2017], there have been a total of:
3 newly confirmed cases
2 newly reported fatalities, and
0 newly reported recoveries.

[Since the last MERS update on 2 Aug 2016, there have been 3 newly confirmed cases/infections -- 2 of whom involved contact with previously confirmed cases -- one a household contact in Jeddah (Makkah region, in the central western part of the country) and a healthcare worker in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region in the north of the country). The 3rd newly confirmed case is from a 3rd region, Najran in the south of the country. Hopefully, the nosocomial transmission will not involve more than one individual in Dawmat Aljandal (Al Jawf region). Maps of Saudi Arabia showing the locations of all cases mentioned above can be found at the source URLs.

The total number of laboratory confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia is now at 1683, including 683 deaths.
