A number of subscribers have sent comments in response to the referenced
posting about proposed experiments to isolate the 1918 influenza virus from
the remains of victims located in permafrost. The following is a list of
those comments.

[One thing that puzzles me is the question of how/why the virus could so
much target young, healthy adults. Is that the explanation typically
given for the seemingly "preferential" attack on young, healthy adults?
Was it purely immunology which explains this? Do we know whether the
increased virulence of this strain was due purely to the antigenic shift
and the absence of immunity in a large segment of the population, or
whether there was/were additional virulence factors present within this
virus?
Perhaps these questions might be answerable if the team sent to extract the
virus from the Norwegian gravesites is successful.
One final thought: there has been "much to do" with this virus and its
pathogenicity. Not wishing to minimize this virus' impact on history, I
wonder whether studies have been done to indicate whether this virus was
really that virulent, whether the human population size in 1918 had reached
a "flash point". [Also, the population was sufficiently urbanized to
magnify the size of the pandemic and establish more notoriety for this
virus. Influenza pandemics since that time have occurred in an era of
major strides in medical technology, and because of that have not been as
"mentionable" as the one of 1918. If you know of any sources that have
addressed this issue, I would appreciate the information.
[Thanks, Hal, for raising some interesting questions, and for helping us to
focus on the importance of advances in medical practice that enable us to
respond to influenza epidemics in a manner that was impossible in 1918.

This story was covered in more detail in an article in The New Yorker (I
think) a week or two ago. The possibility of this virus being "revived" is
rather scary, given the incredible [virulence of this virus, which the
article described as possibly the most deadly virus in history.
[The New Yorker article is definitely worth reading, so thanks to Hank for
calling it to our attention. -Mod. ES

In a message dated 97-10-07 17:54:04 EDT, Jim Chin writes:
"...target made it unique. Unlike other viruses, which targeted the
elderly or children with weak immune systems, the Spanish flu tended to
kill young, healthy adults. The seven Longyearbyen miners were between 19
and 27..."
So there is no misunderstanding, the Spanish flu killed elderly and
children [also, leading to the W shaped mortality curve by age in this
epidemic instead of the U shaped curve observed in all other flu epidemics.
[Thanks for that clarification, Hal. -Mod. ES

If I recall my reading on the subject, the Spanish flu was a new serotype
and it fed on an immunosuppressed host in Europe. I am thinking of what
would happen now with so many immunosuppressed potential hosts.
[Karen's comment serves to remind us of the importance of continued
influenza surveillance to update vaccine antigen content and to maintain
high levels of vaccine coverage in populations at special risk. -Mod. ES
