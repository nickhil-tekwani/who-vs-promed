Spoonbill deaths spark new fears
---------------------------------
The discovery of deadly toxins in carcasses of various birds, ranging from
the common egret to the endangered black-faced spoonbill, demonstrates that
the coastal region near the estuary of the Tsengwen River in southern
Taiwan poses an environmental danger, researchers for the Tainan County
government said yesterday.
Between 9 Dec 2003 and 5 Jan 2003, 88 black-faced spoonbills in Chiku
Lagoon -- on the north side of the Tsengwen River -- were infected
by botulinum [type C] toxin. 71 of those birds died.
Then, on 4 Feb 2003, 2 recently deceased spoonbills were discovered by bird
conservationists from the Bird Society of Taiwan. One bird carcass was
found in the Chiku wetlands, the other in the Sitsao wetlands. What shocked
bird conservationists was that symptoms of the 2 spoonbills were different
from those infected by the botulinum [type C] toxin.
"The real cause of the death of the 2 remains unconfirmed. But their deaths
were not related to the deaths ending in early January 2003," said
veterinarian William Chyi. Chyi has been assisting local governments in the
search for the source of the toxins that led to the sudden die-off of the
endangered spoonbills.
Scientifically speaking, the last die-off technically ended on 5 Jan 2003
because no new deaths were reported in the 2 weeks following that date.
This time, it's not just spoonbills that are dying. In the area around the
Sitsao wetlands -- located on the south side of Tsengwen River -- bird
conservationists also found bodies of various other birds, including egrets
and snipes, Chyi said.
When examining the carcass of a great egret picked up in Sitsao, Chyi
discovered botulinum toxins [types C and D]. Chyi said that researchers and
local activists were still looking for sources of toxins to prevent the
spread of any infections.
Chyi said that researchers had focused on a spot near a fish farm, where
dead fish, dead egrets, and decomposing mice bodies eaten by maggots were
discovered.
On shoals near the fish farm, footprints of the black-faced spoonbills were
discovered -- suggesting that spoonbills had fed there. "We believe that
all kinds of birds near the estuary now are in danger. Undiscovered bodies
of birds and other animals could exacerbate the spread of various
infections because they function like toxin factories," Chyi said. He added
that searching for bodies could be the only workable strategy the local
government could adopt to prevent any more bird infections in coastal areas.
Yang Jiao-yen , assistant to DPP [The Taiwan Democratic Progressive Party]
Legislator Eugene Jao, said that Japanese experts who visited Chihku Lagoon
last month had pointed out that the coastal area was contaminated by spores
of many types of botulinum.
"Some legislators believe that the situation is far more serious than we
can imagine and will soon suggest that the Cabinet have the military search
for bodies and clean up the environment in coastal areas in Tainan County,"
Yang said.
In an effort to seek international assistance with the problem, the local
government will hold an International Symposium on Black-faced Spoonbill
Conservation in late March.
It is expected that Malcolm Coulter of the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, and representatives from
Spoonbill Action Voluntary Echo International, among others, will attend.
Meanwhile, local government officials said they would pay all expenses --
except travel expenses -- for any international conservation organization
which could set up in Tainan for a long-term, on-site investigation into
the deaths of the birds.
