In the national capital [Delhi], mosquito-borne diseases are yet to
subside despite a chill in the air. Doctors have diagnosed 12 people
for Japanese encephalitis [virus; JEV] infection. Japanese
encephalitis, common in the neighbouring states, has surfaced for the
1st time in the city after 4 people tested positive last month
[September 2011].

Four persons came with Japanese encephalitis infection in September
2011 and all of a sudden another 6 were diagnosed during a random
checking," he said. MCD [Municipal Corporation of Delhi] is planning
to hold a meeting on 31 Oct [2011] to mull ways to combat Japanese
encephalitis cases in the city. Said Dr RP Vashishtha, state
surveillance officer, "All are mild cases and not life threatening.
All the 12 cases are of Japanese encephalitis infection. The last 6
cases that were diagnosed of Japanese encephalitis [virus] infection
had shown no external symptoms."
