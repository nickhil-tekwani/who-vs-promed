Diarrhoea outbreak in Kalikot district, mid-western Region (Karnali Zone)
----------------------
I have verified with the district health office [DHO] chief, Dr Om Pd
Aryal, who returned to the district headquarters Manma of Kalikot District
after investigation and initiating control measures of the outbreak of
diarrhoea in 4 VDCs [Village Development Committee] of Kalikot district.
The affected areas lie 30 km [18.6 miles] north-west off the district center.
Approximately 8000 people are at risk, more than 6000 in Khina VDC alone.
Other VDC affected are Chappre, Thirpu, Dhulagoha. There were altogether 45
deaths out of which 39 are in Khina VDC alone. These areas are very remote
and difficult to access. It is possible only by about 2 days walking
(distance), inhabited by marginalised and dalits [lowest caste and
socioeconomic group].
However, a note must be made about the fact that some of these diarrhoeal
cases contracted secondary infection resulting in acute respiratory
infections (ARI) including pneumonia particularly children under 5 years in
deaths. This was confirmed by the medical officer. According to him the
team treated around 1200 episodes of diarrhoea and the outbreak started in
the 3rd week of April [2007], but the DHO was contacted in the 3rd week of
June [2007] only as the responsible health staff were absent due to transfers.
Presently the outbreak is under control and the partners like MSF-H and
Botex-Nepal and local administration extended invaluable support. The area
is under intensified surveillance.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank our colleagues in Nepal and WHO's
South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) for sharing the above information
with us. Dr Khanchit Limpakarnjanarat, the regional adviser, CSR, WHO/SEARO
had the following additional comment: "WHO/SEARO appreciates that the area
is difficult to reach. Unfortunately, many rumors are occurring in the
remote area. This highlights the need to develop RRT [Rapid Response Team]
capacity to expand the coverage in order to mobilize into the scene quickly
-- increasing coverage and timely investigations." WHO/SEARO has made an
offer to collaborate and assist Nepal for the further development of RRTs.
In the newswire accompanying the earlier ProMED-mail posting (see
Unexplained deaths - Nepal (Kalikot): RFI 20070625.2052) no symptomatology
was provided on the outbreak. There were earlier reports from April 2007
suggesting there was a major outbreak of diarrheal diseases in Kalikot, but
nothing further was mentioned on this in the newswire provided in the
posting. It now appears as though the outbreak is a continuation of the
aforementioned outbreak in April 2007. In the prior posting, data were
presented suggesting that the estimated mortality associated with this
outbreak represented approximately 50 per cent of the under 5 year old
mortality for Nepal as a whole. Given the remote nature of the affected
communities, combined with a description suggesting the involved
communities are from lower socioeconomic groups, one suspects that the
overall under 5 year old mortality in this group is significantly higher
than the estimated national average in Nepal. One suspects that the
newswire reported posted on ProMED-mail was just a tip of the iceberg on
the cause specific childhood morbidity and mortality in remote areas in Nepal.
This thread is closed unless more specific epidemiologic information on
this outbreak becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
