USGS Surveillance Update, as of Wed 28 May 2003
-----------------------------------------------
The national and state maps compiled by the USGS reflect information for
the 2003 West Nile virus reporting season that has been submitted and
verified to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The following information is a synopsis of the cumulative data for West
Nile virus surveillance during 2003 up to 28 May, listed according to
state. The original USGS maps further locate both positive and negative
surveillance reports by county. (The data are provisional and may be
subject to revision.)
Birds
-----
12 states are conducting surveillance, with 9 states reporting cumulative
positive test results as follows: Alabama (4), Florida (1), Georgia (4),
Kentucky (0), Louisiana (6), Michigan (2), Mississippi (3), New Jersey (1),
New York (1), Oregon (0), Pennsylvania (1), Washington (0).
Mosquitoes
----------
3 states are conducting surveillance, with 2 states reporting cumulative
positive results as follows: Georgia (2), New Jersey (1), Pennsylvania (0).
Sentinel Flocks
---------------
2 states are conducting surveillance, both reporting cumulative positive
test results as follows: Florida (33), North Carolina (1).
Veterinary
----------
3 states are conducting surveillance, all reporting cumulative positive
test results [presumed to be equines] as follows: Alabama (1), Georgia (5),
Minnesota (1).
Human
-----
There are no reports of surveillance activity or positive test results from
any state. [A suspected case of human infection is awaiting confirmation in
Washington state; see ProMED-mail post "West Nile virus, human - USA
(Washington): suspected 20030601.1334". - Mod.CP]

[Dr. Stephen C. Guptill has provided the following explanatory information
relating to compilation of the USGS Maps in response to the Moderator's
comment in ProMED-mail post "West Nile virus update 2003 - USA (08)
20030522.1255". Dr. Guptill is a Senior Research Physical Scientist at the
U.S. Geological Survey, Reston, Viginia, and Project Chief of the U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS)/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
West Nile virus surveillance mapping activity.
The surveillance maps posted on <http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov> are created
from data contained in CDC's ArboNET surveillance database. The maps
portray summaries of West Nile virus-positive surveillance data reported to
the CDC by cooperating health departments and verified to ArboNET. In
addition, maps for 2 surveillance categories (avians and mosquitoes) will
portray counties that have done "testing" of samples for WNV.
Discrepancies noted between these data and data presented from other
sources reflect local variations in reporting policies and procedures. It
is not unusual for cases to be announced in other media before being
reported and verified in ArboNET.
The schedule for release of new data is the same as that adopted in 2002,
when map publication and MMWR reports of WNV activity were synchronized for
release every Friday. The maps (and MMWR reports) portray data that have
been submitted and verified in ArboNET through the close of business on
Tuesday. We are implementing improvements in our web mapping capabilities
that will allow us to update the maps on a more frequent basis should the
need arise.
The Moderator and ProMED-mail appreciate this explanatory information
provided by Dr. Guptill. - Mod.CP]
