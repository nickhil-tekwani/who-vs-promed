Disease outbreaks reported
11 May 1999
Plague in Namibia
-----------------------
The Ministry of Health and Social Services has reported plague cases in
Ohangwena Region in the north western part of the country. The first
suspected case was reported on 6 Apr 1999 and 39 cases have occurred
up to 5 May 1999, 6 of which have been laboratory confirmed.
Eight patients have died of suspected plague.
The North West regional directorate team, which has had experience in
dealing with plague, has undertaken control activities, including training
courses for health workers, community mobilization for preventive measures,
additional nurses placed at local hospitals and dusting of homesteads.
The Ministry of Health report also states that, although plague has been
endemic in this part of the country, it was successfully controlled in
recent years, the last known cases having occurred in January 1994.

Plague on increase: At least 21 villages affected
------------------------------------------------------
The bubonic plague in the Ohangwena region is spreading from village
to village and has already struck down people in two health areas.
Previously cases were only reported in Ohangwena's Eenhana health
district now the disease is reported to have broken out in the Engela
health district in Ohangwena.
Fears are also rife that it has reached the Oshana region, where a resident
of a village between Ondangwa and Oshakati is said to have been
admitted to hospital with bubonic plague. The worst-affected village in
the Engela district is Oshatotwa, where one resident is reported to have
died from the feared disease.
Seven plague patients, who were admitted to Eenhana hospital three
weeks ago, have all been discharged, and the hospital is only treating
one patient for the plague at the moment. It is also believed that
Onandjokwe hospital has admitted a patient who could be suffering
from the plague. The patient is from Onakatambilili-Eheke, a village
between Ondangwa and Oshakati in the Oshana Region. This means
that the plague (Okatumba) could be spreading to other regions and that
infected residents may not yet have been diagnosed with having the
disease, some health workers told The Namibian yesterday.
According to information given to The Namibian, the first three people
who died from bubonic plague, died in Onandjokwe Hospital on March
25 and April 4.
Added to the eight villages already reported to have been affected by the
disease in the Ohangwena region are 13 more villages in the Engela
health district. Early last week, Dr Hamata and his team took blood
sample from patients and sent them to the South African Institute for
Medical Research which found six of the 11 samples to be positive.
Yesterday Hamata said a team of health inspectors from Oshakati
Hospital went out last Sunday and yesterday to villages such as
Oshatotwa and Onandova to put up traps to catch rats. It is hoped that
the fleas that are carrying the disease can be extracted and sent to South
Africa for further testing.
Bubonic plague is caused by a bacterium which can be transmitted to
humans by flea bites. The fleas often live on rodents such as rats.
