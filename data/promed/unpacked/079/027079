Travel-associated suspected cases of measles
--------------------------------------------
The National Ministry of Health was notified today [6 Aug 2010] of 3
suspected cases of measles in Buenos Aires province. These were people with
a history of travel to South Africa or who had contact with people who
returned from South Africa. This has led the national health authorities to
issue an alert for physicians and the general population to be aware of the
clinical manifestations and notify immediately when there is a suspected
case so that timely control measures can be implemented.

Moreover, after having assessed the vaccination status of contacts, both
family and institutional (schools, kindergartens, hospitals, gated
communities), of the cases, it was decided to vaccinate all susceptible
contacts who do not have an adequate record of age appropriate
immunizations, using either the double or triple antigen vaccine [measles,
mumps, and rubella (MMR) or measles and rubella (MR)].

This warning comes as a result of travelers returning from South Africa,
where an outbreak of measles was reported recently. The situation had
already been reported by national health authorities on 5 May 2010, in
anticipation of people traveling to the World Cup [in South Africa].

Measles is an acute viral disease, potentially serious, highly contagious,
and transmissible. Clinical manifestations include fever, conjunctivitis,
coryza, cough ("triple catarrhal"), rash (such as Koplik's spots), which
are typical but not present in all cases, and a generalized centrifugal
rash, with areas of healthy skin that begins on the face, behind the ears,
spreads down the trunk, thence to the limbs.

It is worth mentioning that in 2002, endemic transmission of measles virus
was interrupted in the Americas Region.

In 2005, Brazil reported 5 cases related to an imported case from the
Maldives Islands (Asia) and in 2006, the Bahian State Secretariat of Health
had laboratory confirmation of 14 cases in Chapada Diamantina. [Note, there
are currently suspected cases in Para Brazil -- see prior ProMED-mail
posting Measles - Brazil: (PA), RFI 20100807.2682 - Mod.MPP]. Venezuela
confirmed several dozen cases in 2006 and 2007.

Since the Americas [region] is in the process of eliminating this disease,
it is necessary to emphasize the measures required to establish the
possible source of infection and viral circulation, as well as to enhance
surveillance and assure adequate vaccination coverages to prevent the
emergence of secondary cases.

[In recent months there has been a resurgence of measles virus infection
throughout central and southern Africa due to a combination of factors
including the economic and administrative stresses associated with the
maintenance of comprehensive childhood vaccination programmes. Measles has
been largely contained in South America but the region remains vulnerable
to importation of infection from elsewhere. It is not clear from the report
above whether the suspected cases are Argentinians returning from visits to
South Africa or visitors arriving in Argentina. Further information on the
citizenship of the 3 cases and confirmation of the diagnosis is awaited. -
