African swine fever virus (inf. with), Dominican Republic
---------------------------------------------------------
General information
Report type: Follow-up report no. 1

Confirmed: [28 Jul 2021]
Reported: 8 Aug 2021
Reason for notification: Recurrence
Last occurrence: 29 Apr 1981

This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

[On 8 Aug 2021, 23 new outbreaks of African swine fever were reported to the OIE. In total, 25 outbreaks have been identified in the country. These outbreaks occurred in the following departments: Santiago (2), Monte Criti (11), Santiago Rodriguez (1), San Juan (2), Duarte (2), Sanchez Ramirez (2), La Vega (1), Dajabon (2), Elias Pina (La Estrelleta) (1), San Cristobal (1).

Summary of outbreaks
New outbreaks: 23
Total outbreaks: 25
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 2401 / 1177 / 1381 / 219 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

[On 29 Jul 2021, the Dominican Republic officially reported to the OIE an event of African swine fever (ASF) (https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=36844). In that report, 2 outbreaks were reported -- one in the province of Monte Cristi and the other in the province of Sanchez Ramirez. The date when the outbreak started was reported to be 1 Jul 2021.

However, in the latest report, follow-up no. 1, the start date of the event was reported as 10 Apr 2021, for an outbreak (OIE outbreak ID ob_88180, see source URL above) that was reported in the province of La Vega. Unfortunately, with this new information, ASF seems to have been circulating in the country for at least the 2 months before it was first officially reported.

Information and recommendations that the Ministry of Agriculture have published on the current African swine fever situation in the Dominican Republic can be found (in Spanish and English) at https://agricultura.gob.do/ppa/. A map of the Dominican Republic showing regional divisions is available at https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4951f.ct002067/.

According to the epidemiological comments, the Georgia 2007 wild-type strain, genotype 2, was detected in the sequencing. The following information comes from an article by Gaudreault et al.

Abstract
--------
"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the sole member of the family _Asfarviridae_, and the only known DNA arbovirus. Since its identification in Kenya in 1921, ASFV has remained endemic in Africa, maintained in a sylvatic cycle between _Ornithodoros_ soft ticks and warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) which do not develop clinical disease with ASFV infection. However, ASFV causes a devastating and economically significant disease of domestic (_Sus scrofa domesticus_) and feral (_Sus scrofa ferus_) swine. There is no ASFV vaccine available, and current control measures consist of strict animal quarantine and culling procedures. The virus is highly stable and easily spreads by infected swine, contaminated pork products and fomites, or via transmission by the _Ornithodoros_ vector. Competent _Ornithodoros_ argasid soft tick vectors are known to exist not only in Africa, but also in parts of Europe and the Americas. Once ASFV is established in the argasid soft tick vector, eradication can be difficult due to the long lifespan of _Ornithodoros_ ticks and their proclivity to inhabit the burrows of warthogs or pens and shelters of domestic pigs. Establishment of endemic ASFV infections in wild boar populations further complicates the control of ASF. Between the late 1950s and early 1980s, ASFV emerged in Europe, Russia and South America, but was mostly eradicated by the mid-1990s. In 2007, a highly virulent genotype II ASFV strain emerged in the Caucasus region and subsequently spread into the Russian Federation and Europe, where it has continued to circulate and spread. Most recently, ASFV emerged in China and has now spread to several neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. The high morbidity and mortality associated with ASFV, the lack of an efficacious vaccine, and the complex makeup of the ASFV virion and genome as well as its lifecycle, make this pathogen a serious threat to the global swine industry and national economies. Topics covered by this review include factors important for ASFV infection, replication, maintenance, and transmission, with attention to the role of the argasid tick vector and the sylvatic transmission cycle, current and future control strategies for ASF, and knowledge gaps regarding the virus itself, its vector and host species." - Mod.CRD
