Fresh polio fear hits Kano, Sokoto, Katsina
-------------------------------------------
As Nigeria and the international community continue to celebrate the
success recorded in the fight against the dreaded poliomyelitis
scourge, there are fears of a possible resurgence of cases in 3
states in northwestern Nigeria.

One case each of the wild poliovirus (WPV3) has been suspected to
have occurred in Kano, Sokoto, and Katsina States.

[The Leadership] correspondent gathered exclusively that as at
yesterday [29 Oct 2010], health officials in the federal and state
governments were making frantic efforts to investigate the case
suspected to have occurred in Dambatta, Dambatta local government
area of Kano State.

Similarly, cases are also being investigated in Wurno in Sokoto
State, as well as in an undisclosed area in Katsina State.

To recount, in recent times, Federal and foreign donor agencies have
been popping champagne to celebrate what their statistics put at 98
percent success attained in the sustained combat to eradicate the
dreaded ailment.

Efforts to reach the North West zonal coordinator of the National
Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Abdullahi Bulama
Garba proved abortive as officials in his office told our
correspondent he went out on a crucial field assignment.

Also, none of the officials was ready to either deny or confirm the
veracity of the cases suspected to have occurred in these states' as
they revealed they are not in a position to speak on the issue.
Specifically, the Rotary International had rolled out the carpet to
toast to the success some weeks back.

Only Nigeria, India, and Pakistan are reported not to have fully
stemmed the scourge worldwide.

[While the newswire above refers to the cases as "suspected", the
mention that each of the 3 suspected cases is due to infection with
wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3) suggests there is laboratory
identification of the WPV3 from specimens from these cases. We await
further confirmation on these cases.

According to the most recent case count available on the polio
eradication website, as of 26 Oct 2010, there have been 8 cases of
WPV associated polio in Nigeria -- 4 attributable to infection with
WPV1 and 4 to infection with WPV3 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>).
The date of onset of the most recent case was 27 Aug 2010. Of note,
of 747 cases of polio with WPV isolated this year (2010), 163 were in
endemic countries, and 584 were in non-endemic countries. The
outbreak in Tajikistan involved 458 cases, with another 14 identified
in the Russian Federation, 3 identified in Turkmenistan, and one
identified in Kazakhstan.

states mentioned (Kano, Katsina, and Sokoto) are in the north and

[2] WHO-AFRO multicountry update
Date: Tue 26 Oct 2010

Africa seizes chance against polio
----------------------------------
Recently, Africa seized an unprecedented chance to drive out polio
when 15 countries across the continent launched a synchronized mass
immunization campaign to reach 72 million children, capitalizing on
gains made this year [2010]. A total of some 290 000 vaccinators have
been mobilized to go door-to-door to deliver 2 drops of oral polio
vaccine (OPV) to every child under 5 in areas considered at "highest
risk" of polio transmission.

Africa's leaders demonstrated unprecedented cooperation and
commitment to carry out a series of synchronized immunization
activities in 2009 and in March and April 2010, following the spread
of the disease from Nigeria which came to infect 24 countries across
west and central Africa and in the Horn of Africa.

As a direct result of these immunization campaigns, the polio
outbreaks have slowed to a trickle. Across West Africa, only Liberia
and Mali have recorded any cases in the past 5 months, while Nigeria
-- the only country in Africa never to have stopped polio
transmission -- has slashed polio by 98 percent in the past year.
[According to the most recent data available on the polio eradication
website from 26 Oct 2010, countries in Africa with wild poliovirus
(WPV) associated disease with dates of onset within the past 5 months
(since 26 May 2010) include Nigeria, Congo DR, Angola, Sudan, Uganda,
Mali, and Liberia. See
<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>
- Mod.MPP]

Risks of not completing eradication
-----------------------------------
However, recent weeks have shown the very real risks of not
completing eradication, with a September [2010] case in Liberia
confirming residual transmission, a new importation of type 3 wild
poliovirus into Mali (the 1st since 2001), and a case in Uganda,
which had been polio-free for more than a year.

In all countries, rapid assessments are being conducted to formulate
an emergency response plan in which 2 additional mop-up rounds will
be held. All countries in the West Africa sub-region will again
conduct 2 full campaigns in February and March 2011, but high-quality
immunization campaigns must be complemented by enhanced routine
immunization and strong disease surveillance.

With the outbreak in Angola (25 cases) having spilled over the border
into neighboring provinces of the Congo DR (28 cases), these 2
countries now represent the greatest threat to polio in Africa,
having recorded 48 of Africa's 58 cases in the past 6 months.

However, the virus in Congo DR remains geographically restricted and
in Angola, steps by the Government to close vaccination coverage gaps
in the most recent campaign -- which started on 1 Oct [2010] -- saw
the percentage of missed children in the key reservoir of Luanda fall
from nearly 30 percent to 13 percent, while nationally, the
percentage of missed children fell from 15 percent to 8 percent.

WHO's Regional Director for Africa, Dr Luis G Sambo, acknowledged the
recent steps taken by Angola and Congo DR to close vaccination
coverage gaps, with the Angolan Minister of Health personally
vaccinating children on the streets of Luanda during the October
[2010] campaign. "In Africa," Dr Sambo said, "we are seeing the
essential government support that can make the difference between
success and failure. But much more remains to be done to fill the
gaps if we are to protect the stunning gains made this year [2010]."

"We are on the cusp of an exciting possibility here," said Dr
Gianfranco Rotigliano, UNICEF's Regional Director for West and
Central Africa. "Political leaders across Africa answered the
challenge posed by this dreadful disease and the results are before
us. It shows what can be done when there is leadership and dynamic
partnership with donor support around such an important health issue.
We need to continue efforts to vaccinate and to put the needs of
children in Africa 1st."

Many volunteer vaccinators in these vaccination campaigns will be
Rotarians, who have themselves given almost USD 1 billion to the
polio eradication effort since 1985. Mr Ambroise Tshimbalanga
Kasongo, chair of Rotary's African PolioPlus Committee, called on
international donors to stay the course to finish the job by filling
the USD 810 million funding gap in the Global Polio Eradication
Initiative Strategic Plan that aims to eradicate polio globally by 2013.

"Rotary's catch phrase is 'End Polio Now'," he said. "In Africa, the
end of polio is in sight, but we are not there yet. To think we could
not reach the finishing line because of lack of financial resources
is unacceptable."

The 15-country synchronized activities will cost approximately USD
42.6 million, and are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
USAID, Rotary International, UNICEF, and the Governments of Germany and Japan.

Immunization activities
-----------------------
Congo DR and Angola will launch immunization activities from 28 Oct
and 29 Oct [2010], respectively, while the 10-country synchronized
campaigns are being launched from today (26 Oct 2010) in Cote
d'Ivoire, from 28 Oct 2010 in Benin, Burkina Faso, Gambia, Guinea,
Mali, Mauritania, Senegal, and Sierra Leone, and from 29 Oct 2010 in Liberia.

Chad and Sudan will launch immunization activities on 1 Nov 2010 ,
while last week (from 23 Oct 2010), Nigeria immunized more than 29
million children in 20 high-risk northern states. The Global Polio
Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is spearheaded by national governments,
WHO, Rotary International, the CDC and UNICEF. The Global Polio
Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is spearheaded by national governments,
WHO, Rotary International, the CDC, and UNICEF. Since the launch of
the GPEI in 1988, the incidence of polio has been reduced by more
than 99 percent. In 1988, more than 350 000 children were paralyzed
each year in more than 125 endemic countries. Only 4 countries remain
endemic: Nigeria, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

[In this report, renewed cases of polio have been reported in Angola,
Congo DR, Liberia, and Mali -- the 1st since 2001. A case has also
been reported in Uganda, which had been polio-free for more than a
year. The outbreaks are attributed to low immunisation coverage both
during routine and supplementary immunisation. There is therefore
need for synchronized immunization campaigns reaching as many
children as possible in addition to strengthening and maintaining
adequate surveillance.

Fifteen countries across Africa are therefore conducting massive
polio immunisation campaigns. Many experts are optimistic that
despite the cases reported this year (2010) -- 110 cases from 11
African countries -- the situation is still better than last year
(2009) -- 736 cases from 19 African countries
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek.aspx>).
There is therefore need to maintain vigilance and the political
commitment to ensure children are reached during the campaigns and
importantly through routine immunisation.

isolated from cases can be seen at

[Significant progress has been seen in reducing the transmission of
WPV in the African countries. While the notice above mentions the
ongoing and upcoming synchronized efforts to increase vaccination
coverages in the West African countries, Angola, Congo DR, the Sudan
and Chad, the recent occurrence of a WPV1 case in Uganda that is
genetically related to a virus that was circulating in the Turkana
region of Kenya in February 2009, served as a reminder of the ability
of the WPV to maintain a low level circulation "under the radarscope"
of the intensified AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) surveillance
activities -- probably related to continuous transmission resulting
in non-paralytic infections. Checking the polio eradication website
weekly case count updates, there have been WPV cases identified in 21
African countries since with dates of onset since 28 Mar 2009. One
can't help but wonder if there is WPV in circulation "under the
radarscope" in the other countries that have identified cases but are
not presently scheduled for intensified vaccination activities. One
also wonders if there will be a need in the future to increase
laboratory surveillance efforts on specimens from the environment and
non-paralytic cases to see if there is WPV circulation. - Mod.MPP]
