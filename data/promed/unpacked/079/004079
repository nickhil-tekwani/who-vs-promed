Anthrax is suspected to be spreading its tentacles in the tribal areas of Koraput district, and 199 persons have become victims of the dreaded disease in the last 4 years. According to reports, the disease has assumed endemic proportions in spite of several awareness programmes being undertaken in the district.

In the past couple of days, at least 20 persons have been reportedly affected by anthrax at Rupuguda in Mathapada panchayat of Boipariguda block. The affected villagers have developed swellings and blisters on their limbs, with pus oozing out of the sores. The affected persons include children and elderly persons. They were identified as DK (12), JRG (12), DG (14), JK (25), BG (45), and MK (40) in Rupuguda village.

According to health officials, the bacterium lies in the soil and affects cattle that consume it along with grass while grazing. The tribals collect beef from the carcass of the cattle and dry it under the sun for consumption throughout the year. The food habit of the tribals leads to the spread of the diseases among them.

Reports from the CDMO's [chief district medical officer] office indicate that in 2016, the disease affected 67 persons, and one died from it. Similarly, in 2017, 75 persons were affected, and one person died of the disease. There were no deaths in 2018 and 2019, but 24 and 33 persons have been afflicted by the disease in 2018 and 2019, respectively. However, a private estimate said the actual number of affected persons and toll could be more than the stated government figures.

The disease is endemic in the Pottangi, Kunduli, Boipariguda, Nandapur, Kundura, Lamtaput, and Dasamantpur areas in the district. Many people in the district consume snail meat, beef from the carcass of cattle, and toxic mushrooms collected from jungles due to poverty.

This apart, the tribals depend on sorcerers and witch doctors for treatment in case of a disease, leading to the disease's rapid spread. People affected by some ailment prefer to visit a sorcerer over a doctor and end up losing their lives. The district administration seems to be unaware about the ground realities.

The state and the Centre have framed schemes to uplift the poor, but the actual poor have failed to reap the benefits of the schemes. When contacted, Dr Arun Padhi, additional district medical officer (ADMO), said lack of awareness among the tribals is responsible for the spread of the disease. A medical team that has been rushed to the Boipariguda block has started treatment of the affected persons.

[For a description of Koraput district, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koraput_district. There is a map showing its location in India.

This situation report shines a bright light on why it is necessary to get ahead of this zoonotic disease and its human problems by routinely vaccinating the cattle. If the locals cannot be trusted or organised to do it themselves, it must be done for them. This carries a cost, granted, but it prevents the very much higher costs of treating human cases and deaths. Humans are not a cheap species to manage. - Mod.MHJ
