UNICEF -- Liberia Ebola outbreak: SitRep no. 18
-----------------------------------------------
Key Points
----------
The total number of suspected, probable, and confirmed Ebola [virus disease, EVD] cases stands at 27; Ebola-related deaths stands at 13; and confirmed Ebola cases stands at 6.

The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) is in the midst of "cleaning" existing Ebola case data, including exclusion of cases that have tested negative for the virus. The Ebola statistics are likely to change accordingly in the coming days.

National Airports Corporation Limited (NACL) has called on the country's 3 international airports to screen all passengers for the deadly contact-borne [ebolavirus]. The move is meant to stop the spread of the Ebola [virus disease] from West Africa, where it was first reported to central Africa.

NACL managing director Robinson Misitala said measures against Ebola have already been put in place to screen passengers passing through terminals at Kenneth Kaunda, Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula, and Simon Mwansa Kapwepwe international airports in Lusaka, Livingstone, and Ndola, respectively.

"Working with the Ministry of Health, a team has been put in place and awareness has been conducted with all the medical staff at the airport, airlines, and security staff and immigration department so that they are ready for any eventuality," he said. He also said all 3 airports have isolation areas for all the communicable diseases such as Ebola.

The World Health Organisation notes that once the Ebola breaks out, the fatality rate is up to 90 percent. [Note "up to", not always. -Mod.JW]

Mr Misitala said NACL has created desks to deal with any suspect at the airport with the Ministry of Health and the airport clinics. He said the Ministry of Health has plans to procure necessary protective clothing for medical staff. "Although at present Ebola is in West Africa and has not reached the southern part of Africa, we are very alert at NACL," he said.

Recently, the Ministry of Health in Livingstone urged all stakeholders such as airport staff, immigration, hotels, and lodges to be on high alert to prevent the deadly strain of ebolavirus. Acting Southern Province medical officer Emmanuel Kooma said the vulnerability of Livingstone is high as people want to visit the Victoria Falls and other tourist attractions. "There is need to strengthen the international health regulation of 2005 on public health disease surveillance," he said. Livingstone Tourism Association chairperson Alex Munthali has urged its members to be on high alert as this is the peak period for tourism and they should isolate suspected cases of Ebola.

[It is commendable that countries in West and southern Africa are taking precautions against the importation of EVD. All Sub-Saharan African countries would do well to prepare their own contingency plans.

I hope the Livingstone Tourism Association has been informed of the nearest hospitals to the national parks and other tourist spots where they can isolate suspected cases of Ebola. Those hospitals need to prepare isolation wards, have PPE (personal protection equipment) available, and staff trained in infection control. Victoria Falls are only 11 km [6.8 mi] from Livingstone, so presumably there is no problem there. - Mod.JW
