Clinical signs and pathology shown by British sheep and cattle infected
with bluetongue virus serotype 8 derived from the 2006 outbreak in northern
Europe
---------------------------------------------
Abstract:
Four poll Dorset sheep and 4 Holstein-Friesian cattle were infected with
the northern European strain of bluetongue virus (BTV), BTV-8, to assess
its pathogenicity in UK breeds. The time course of infection was monitored
in both species by using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR),
conventional RT-PCR and serology. Two of the sheep developed severe
clinical signs that would have been fatal in the field; the other 2 were
moderately and mildly ill, respectively. The cattle were clinically
unaffected but had high levels of viral RNA in their bloodstream. Real-time
RT-PCR detected viral RNA as early as one day after infection in the cattle
and 3 days after infection in the sheep. Antibodies against BTV were
detected by 6 days after infection in the sheep and 8 days after infection
in the cattle. Postmortem examinations revealed pathology in the cattle
that was more severe than suggested by the mild clinical signs, but the
pathological and clinical findings in the sheep were more consistent.

[There are at least 85 sheep breeds in the UK; for the comprehensive list,
background data and pictures, see
<http://www.nationalsheep.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=9&Itemid=41>.
The poll Dorset, a fine-wool sheep initially bred from the Dorset Horn in
Australia, has probably been selected for the above experimental infection
trial because of its expected high susceptibility to BTV and the presence
of this breed in significant numbers in southern England. Other UK sheep
breeds may demonstrate different, variable and not necessarily lesser
susceptibility to BTV-8.
For readers' convenience, the following passage is copied:
"Clinical observations
----------------------
"Pyrexia was recorded in all 4 sheep from 5 days after inoculation, their
temperatures exceeding 40 C. After 6 to 7 days, their temperatures had
reached 41 C, and because of the severity of the clinical signs, 2 of them
were treated with flunixin meglumine (Finadyne; Schering-Plough Animal
Health). No pyrexia was recorded in any of the cattle at any stage of the
experiment. Clinical signs were 1st observed in 3 of the 4 sheep 5 days
after inoculation; they had hyperaemia of the buccal, labial and nasal
mucosa, facial oedema (most prominently in the lips), and conjunctivitis
was starting to develop. They also developed early signs of coronitis
resulting in a reddening of the area around the coronary band and warm,
painful feet. All 4 sheep developed a range of clinical signs from 7 to 14
days after inoculation. Sheep 1 developed severe oedema and swelling of the
face, particularly the lips. The hyperaemia of the nasal, buccal and gum
mucosa intensified, and small petechial haemorrhages developed on the
mucosal membranes of the lips and the tongue. Its breathing was rapid and
shallow (tachypnoea), and fluid was detected in the lung and bronchial
regions of the chest cavity by auscultation. It developed severe coronitis,
resulting in bleeding around the coronary band, and it became severely lame
and disinclined to move. Sheep 2 developed facial oedema similar to sheep
1. It had very severe breathing difficulties, including tachypnoea, leading
to abnormally rapid breathing (hyperpnoea) and severe respiratory distress.
A combination of very swollen lips and tongue, severe nasal discharge and
dyspnoea prevented it from closing its mouth, and it breathed continuously
through its mouth. Auscultation of the lung detected noises that strongly
suggesting the presence of large amounts of fluid. The sheep became
anorexic and depressed, and it was euthanased 8 days after it had been
inoculated. Although it was lame and developed coronitis, there was no
bleeding around the coronary band.
"Sheep 3 developed more moderate clinical signs, including generalised
swelling of the face, hyperaemia of the nasal, buccal and labial mucosa and
a mucocatarrhal nasal discharge. It also developed moderate coronitis on
all 4 feet, and became lame. On auscultation, there was some evidence of
fluid in the lungs, but it showed only mild signs of respiratory distress
(slight tachypnoea). Sheep 4 was the least affected. Its clinical signs
included mild conjunctivitis, moderate facial oedema and mild hyperaemia of
the nose and mouth. It developed only mild coronitis, and its respiratory
system appeared to be unaffected. The calves were almost entirely
clinically unaffected by infection with the BTV-8 strain. Calf 1 developed
mild conjunctivitis, and calf 4 developed ulcers on its upper gum that were
not associated with any salivation or detectable anorexia. These signs may
have been incidental and not directly associated with the BTV infection.
They would probably not have been detected under field conditions. Calf 2
was euthanased 10 days after it had been inoculated."
The paper's discussion chapter includes the following comment on the
clinical observations:
"The infection of 4 poll Dorset sheep and 4 Holstein-Friesian calves with
the northern European outbreak strain of BTV-8 resulted in clinical disease
in all 4 sheep, but the calves showed no clinical signs. Despite the use of
identical doses of virus, the severity of the clinical signs varied
significantly, with severe clinical signs in 2 of the sheep (which would
have led to death under field conditions) but relatively mild signs in the
other 2. This high degree of variation, combined with the known interbreed
variation in susceptibility to BTV, illustrates the difficulty in reliably
detecting bluetongue by clinical signs alone."

As of 5:00 pm on 11 Oct 2007, there were 36 confirmed premises affected by
bluetongue. This figure will normally be updated once daily (Monday to
Friday). The cases of bluetongue remain within the Bluetongue Control Zone
and are located in a cluster in the Ipswich area, with further cases in
Essex and near Lowestoft.
