It is with great sadness that I'm sharing the news that Paul Farmer passed away today [22 Feb 2022]. As many of you know, Paul dedicated his remarkable life to improving healthcare for the most vulnerable people in the world. He embodied the spirit that is public health, working tirelessly to promote human rights and human dignity.

Paul co-founded Partners in Health, a global nonprofit charged with developing innovative strategies for reaching remote communities and delivering high-quality care even -- or rather, especially -- in areas with few resources. Paul also served as chancellor of the University of Global Health Equity, which aims to train a new generation of global health leaders to build sustainable, equitable, and resilient health systems for the world's poor. Closer to home, he was a pillar of our Longwood community as the Kolokotrones University Professor and chair of the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School. Paul won numerous awards for his humanitarian service and was the recipient of a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship as well as the Skoll Foundation Social Entrepreneur of the Year award.

Recounting the full list of Paul's achievements would take many paragraphs. What I want to convey today is my deep appreciation for the values he held and the life he lived. Across the decades, starting when he was still in school, he made an immense and tangible difference to millions of people in Haiti, in Rwanda, in Peru, and in so many other troubled corners of the world. He lifted up communities closer to home as well; to cite just one recent example, he helped establish a contact tracing program that played an important role in shaping the response to COVID in Massachusetts. He pushed limits in a way that made many of us redefine our definition of what was possible. And he did it all with an enormous empathy that came from embedding himself in the communities he served, so he could truly understand their needs and their priorities.

In remembering Paul, I keep returning to the word "remarkable." His death at age 62 is a tragedy, an enormous loss for the field of public health and for the people of the world. But we know his legacy will live on for generations -- in the lives he touched, in the physicians he trained, in the programs he developed, in the good works he inspired. His legacy lives on, as well, in his 3 children and his wife, Didi Bertrand Farmer. Our hearts are with them at this most difficult time.

I encourage you to read this beautiful obituary for Paul in the Boston Globe; it includes moving tributes from several of his heartbroken colleagues (https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/02/21/metro/dr-paul-farmer-who-tirelessly-brought-health-care-worlds-neediest-dies-62/). I will keep you informed of memorial services as plans develop.

I'll close with a quote from Paul's 2003 book, "Pathologies of Power." He wrote: "It took me a relatively short time in Haiti to discover that I could never serve as a dispassionate reporter or chronicler of misery. I am only on the side of the destitute sick and have never sought to represent myself as some sort of neutral party."

May we all live up to that legacy.

Best,
Michelle

Dr Paul Farmer, a physician, humanitarian and author renowned for providing healthcare to millions of impoverished people worldwide and who co-founded the global nonprofit Partners in Health, has died. He was 62. The Boston-based organization confirmed Farmer's death on Monday [21 Feb 2022], calling it "devastating" and noting he unexpectedly died in his sleep from an acute cardiac event while in Rwanda, where he had been teaching.

Farmer was a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chief of the division of global health equity at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He wrote extensively on health, human rights and social inequality.

"A compassionate physician and infectious disease specialist, a brilliant and influential medical anthropologist, and among the greatest humanitarians of our time -- perhaps all time -- Paul dedicated his life to improving human health and advocating for health equity and social justice on a global scale," wrote George Q Daley, dean of Harvard University's Faculty of Medicine, in a statement.

Partners in Health, founded in 1987, said its mission is "to provide a preferential option for the poor in healthcare." The organization began its work in Cange, a rural village in Haiti's central plateau, and later expanded its operations to regions including Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

The Pulitzer prize-winning author Tracy Kidder, who wrote the nonfiction book "Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World," said the 2 traveled together for a month as Farmer treated prisoners and impoverished people in Haiti, Moscow and Paris. "He was an important figure in the world," Kidder said. "He had a way of looking around corners and of connecting things. He couldn't obviously go and cure the whole world all by himself, but he could, with help of his friends, give proof of possibility."

One of Kidder's strongest memories of Farmer occurred in Peru, where the doctor was treating patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Kidder recalled a woman wearing a Mickey Mouse shirt who followed them to their car, looking very shy. With her head down, she said "thank you" to Farmer in Spanish. Kidder recalled: "Paul turned, took each of her hands in his and said, 'For me, it is a privilege,' in Spanish." He added that Farmer was instrumental in getting AIDS treatments to people in poor nations, and created various health systems around the world. "It really humiliates the naysayers, who think it's somehow OK for some people to get healthcare and others not," Kidder said. "It just drove him nuts."

Michelle Karshan, vice-president of a nonprofit prison healthcare system in Haiti who worked closely with Farmer, said he was determined, innovative and always knew how to get around obstacles and bureaucracy. "He didn't take no for an answer," she said. "He didn't think anybody was too poor or too illiterate to be entitled to receive healthcare." She noted that when the World Health Organization resisted giving HIV medication to people who were illiterate in Haiti for fear they would not know when or how to take it, Farmer set up his own program and created a chart that relied on the sun's position.

He also hired people known as "accompaniers" who would hike through Haiti's rough mountainous terrain to make sure patients had water and food and were taking their medications. "I'm so sad for all the people who are not going to have him in their lives. He was there for everybody," Karshan said.

Haiti's prime minister, Ariel Henry, praised Farmer's work, as did former US president Bill Clinton. "Paul Farmer changed the way healthcare is delivered in the most impoverished places on Earth. He saw every day as a new opportunity to teach, learn, give, and serve -- and it was impossible to spend any time with him and not feel the same," Clinton said.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with thousands of cases reported daily in Massachusetts, local health departments were overwhelmed by the task of contact tracing to help slow the spread of the disease. The state launched a contact tracing collaborative in April 2020 and asked Partners in Health to lead it. It made more than 2.7 million calls to residents at a total cost of about USD 158 million, according to the state.

Farmer is survived by his Haitian wife, Didi Bertrand Farmer, and their 3 children.

[Dr. Paul Farmer's untiring message that the poorest people of the earth deserve first-world healthcare is relevant to inequities in providing COVID-19 diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics to poor countries devastated by the pandemic. He was a mentor to many, and his life should serve as an example to emulate. - ProMED Editors and Moderators]

[I knew Paul since his residency and fellowship days at Brigham and Women's Hospital. We worked together as attendings there for several years. He was warm, funny, collegial and adored by housestaff and ID fellows (and by patients and almost everyone he met). He was the 1st person to tell me about ProMED, more than 20 years ago, an offhand remark that would change my life. I soon became a reader of ProMED, then Editor in 2002 when the position became available.

Paul had a longstanding relationship with the Massachusetts State Public Health Lab, where I now work. This began when Paul would hand-carry TB specimens back from Haiti for testing at the State Lab. It evolved into a program that utilized the state lab to do a large number of specimens from Haiti, providing drug resistance testing and genotyping of TB isolates. Finally, this technology was transferred to Haiti where state-of-the-art TB testing remains in place.

I spoke again with Paul at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. He wanted to make sure that Haiti and other developing countries had quick access to molecular testing for COVID and wanted to ensure that these technologies would be rapidly deployed where needed.

His untimely death is a tragedy for everyone who knew him, for the global health community and for the world. - Larry Madoff, ProMED Editor Emeritus]
