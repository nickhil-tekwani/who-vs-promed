Update on the diphtheria outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, 2015
------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the last update posted in ProMED-mail on 1 May 2015 [archive no 20150501.3333702], additional new cases and deaths have been reported. To date, diphtheria case-patients have been reported from 2 (eThekwini and Ugu) districts in KwaZulu-Natal Province both of which are highly populated urban and peri-urban areas. As at 6 Jul 2015, a total of 15 diphtheria cases (11 of which are laboratory-confirmed as toxin producing) including 4 deaths have been reported. 6 asymptomatic carriers of laboratory-confirmed toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ were identified in contacts of 4 diphtheria cases. Cases range in age from 4 to 41 years (median 10 years). Where vaccination history has been verified (n = 6), 4 case-patients were not up to date with their diphtheria immunizations according to age.

Diphtheria antitoxin treatment (DAT) was procured through a generous donation by the Japanese government, and has been administered to 6 case-patients to date. Outbreak response has included a number of public health interventions, notably the provision of antimicrobials to close contacts and catch-up vaccination campaigns and health promotion activities. In addition, molecular characterization of isolates is being undertaken.

Since the last suspected case of diphtheria was identified on 12 Jun 2015, 3 weeks have passed. Heightened surveillance will continue for any new cases.

Prior to this outbreak, the last laboratory-confirmed case in South Africa was reported in February 2010 and the patient died. An additional clinical case was reported in August 2013 and this patient survived. Both cases were in children.

The following was extracted from http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf:

Diphtheria is an acute, toxin-mediated disease caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_. The name of the disease is derived from the Greek 'diphthera', meaning leather hide. The disease was described in the 5th century BCE by Hippocrates, and epidemics were described in the 6th century AD by Aetius. The bacterium was first observed in diphtheritic membranes by Edwin Klebs in 1883 and cultivated by Friedrich Loeffler in 1884. Antitoxin was invented in the late 19th century, and toxoid was developed in the 1920s.

_C. diphtheriae_ is an aerobic Gram positive bacillus. Toxin production (toxigenicity) occurs only when the bacillus is itself infected (lysogenized) by a specific virus (bacteriophage) carrying the genetic information for the toxin (tox gene). Only toxigenic strains can cause severe disease. Culture of the organism requires selective media containing tellurite. If isolated, the organism must be distinguished in the laboratory from other _Corynebacterium_ species that normally inhabit the nasopharynx and skin (such as diphtheroids). _C. diphtheriae_ has 3 biotypes -- gravis, intermedius, and mitis. The most severe disease is associated with the gravis biotype, but any strain may produce toxin. All isolates of _C. diphtheriae_ should be tested by the laboratory for toxigenicity.

Susceptible persons may acquire toxigenic diphtheria bacilli in the nasopharynx. The organism produces a toxin that inhibits cellular protein synthesis and is responsible for local tissue destruction and membrane formation. The toxin produced at the site of the membrane is absorbed into the bloodstream and then distributed to the tissues of the body. The toxin is responsible for the major complications of myocarditis and neuritis and can also cause low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) and protein in the urine (proteinuria). Clinical disease associated with non-toxin-producing strains is generally milder. While rare severe cases have been reported, these may actually have been caused by toxigenic strains that were not detected because of inadequate culture sampling.

The incubation period of diphtheria is 2-5 days (range, 1-10 days). Disease can involve almost any mucous membrane. For clinical purposes, it is convenient to classify diphtheria into a number of manifestations, depending on the site of disease. The most common sites of diphtheria infection are the pharynx and the tonsils. Infection at these sites is usually associated with substantial systemic absorption of toxin. The onset of pharyngitis is insidious. Early symptoms include malaise, sore throat, anorexia, and low-grade fever. Within 2-3 days, a bluish-white membrane forms and extends, varying in size from covering a small patch on the tonsils to covering most of the soft palate. Often by the time a physician is contacted, the membrane is greyish-green, or black if bleeding has occurred. There is a minimal amount of mucosal erythema surrounding the membrane. The membrane is adherent to the tissue, and forcible attempts to remove it cause bleeding. Extensive membrane formation may result in respiratory obstruction.

The patient may recover at this point; or if enough toxin is absorbed, develop severe prostration, striking pallor, rapid pulse, stupor, and coma, and may even die within 6 to 10 days. Fever is usually not high, even though the patient may appear quite toxic. Patients with severe disease may develop marked edema of the submandibular areas and the anterior neck along with lymphadenopathy, giving a characteristic "bull neck" appearance.

Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants. - Mod.LL]
