The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation's health department has
identified 3 areas in the city -- Kurla, Dharavi and Goreagon (East)
-- from where 25 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been
reported in September [2010]. "We are taking all precautions to ensure
that the number doesn't increase. We are conducting tests on patients
at Sion Hospital," said Dr GT Ambe, executive health officer. Congress
corporator Vinod Shekhar said: "There has been a sudden spurt of
chikungunya cases at Marine Drive and Cuffe Parade as well. The civic
body must take appropriate measures to ensure that the disease doesn't
spread," said Shekhar.

Chikungunya is a viral disease spread by the _Aedes_ mosquitoes. "We
are continuing the fogging activity that was started during the
monsoons," said Additional Municipal Commissioner Anil Diggikar. "We
are also collecting blood samples and sending them for tests."

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is the civic body that
governs the city of Mumbai. Reliance on fogging alone is likely to
provide only short-term vector control, if reduction of vector
mosquito breeding sites is not done also.

The 29 Sep 2010 issue of The Times of India
(<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Viral-diseases-on-the-rise-since-June/articleshow/6646690.cms>) reported that the city of Pune [also in Maharashtra state] had 41 cases of chikungunya virus
infection.
