In 2011, several large measles outbreaks have been reported from
Member States in the European and African regions, with several
reported outbreaks in the Americas linked to Europe or Africa.

Europe: As of 20 Sep 2011, 40 of 53 Member States in the WHO European
Region have reported 26 025 confirmed measles cases for the period
January to July 2011 to the WHO European Regional Office through
routine surveillance and outbreak reports. The highest number of cases
was reported from France with 14 025 cases for the 1st 6 months of the
year. In addition, 11 of all cases in the Region were lethal (6 in
France and one in each in Germany, Kyrgyzstan, Romania, the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the United Kingdom). The
predominant genotype currently circulating in the European Region is
D4, the same endemic genotype from the United Kingdom in 2008. The
most recent outbreak was reported from Israel in September 2011, with
12 cases. Member States have responded to the outbreak by modifying
the vaccination schedule, like France, or by offering vaccination free
of charge or in schools, to increase accessibility to and availability
of vaccines.

Africa: The Regional Office reports that as of 20 Sep 2011, large
measles outbreaks are being reported by the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, with over 103 000 cases, Nigeria, with 17 428 cases, Zambia,
with 5397 cases and Ethiopia, with 2902 cases. Even though deaths are
not routinely reported to the Regional Office, the WHO Country Office
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DR reported over 1100
measles-associated deaths in the country during 2011.

The Americas: The last case of endemic measles was reported from the
region in 2002. In 2011, the Region has received reports of several
outbreaks linked to importation of measles virus from other regions.
The largest, in Quebec, Canada, involves 742 reported cases, 89
requiring hospitalization, but no measles-associated deaths. Other
outbreaks have been reported from the United States (213 cases),
Ecuador (41 cases), Brazil (18 cases), Columbia (7 cases), Mexico (3
cases), and Chile (6 cases). Most of these outbreaks are linked to
importations from Europe, except for outbreaks in the United States
and Chile linked to cases from Malaysia and the outbreak in Ecuador,
linked to Kenya.

Measles is a highly infectious disease that causes complications and
deaths, even in previously-healthy individuals, but is fully
preventable by vaccination. Countries need to ensure that they reach
95 percent coverage with 2 doses of measles vaccine across all age
groups up to 15 years of age. Otherwise, the country will experience
measles outbreaks with large numbers of cases, associated
hospitalizations and deaths. The recent outbreaks in countries with
high volumes of international travellers can lead to measles
exportation to regions previously free of measles, such as the Region
of the Americas or certain African countries. These exportations can
lead to large outbreaks and associated deaths.

These outbreaks should remind travellers that they should ensure that
they have had 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine before their
trip.

After the measles outbreak in France literally exploded earlier this
year [2011], the measles epidemic finally seems to have stalled for
several months, according to figures from the l'Institut National de
Veille Sanitaire (InVS).

Nearly 22 000 cases of measles have been reported in France since 1
Jan 2008. The 3rd epidemic wave was "massive," said the l'Institut
National de Veille Sanitaire, compared to the 2 previous waves. For
the 1st 8 months of 2011, nearly 14 600 cases were reported, of which
16 showed a neurological complication, 647 suffered severe pneumonia,
and 6 died.

Since a peak in March 2011, there has been a sharp decline in case
numbers.

[This recent decline in case numbers may be a consequence of increased
uptake of vaccine or perhaps exhaustion of the pool of susceptibles. -

For the past 3 years, Astrakhan has been considered to be a
measles-free region, with no confirmed case recorded. The situation
has now changed. According to Alexandr Burkina, the Director of the
Regional Infectious Disease Hospital, the majority of the new cases
are residents of the Leninskii region of Astrakhan.

The Director stated that: "Previously, measles in our region had been
imported from other regions, but now there are cases of indigenous
measles among local residents. This is a consequence of the fact that
many children have not been vaccinated against the disease as a result
of problems in our Outpatients Service, whereby children in the
14-month age group have not been vaccinated against any disease.

The confirmed measles cases comprise 9 children and 8 adults.

Measles can be a serious disease, particularly if contracted in
adulthood, and every unvaccinated person should attend their local
clinic for vaccination.

The Iloilo Provincial Health Office (IPHO) has recommended a massive
measles vaccination of children aged from 6 to 11 months of age in 4
barangays [communities] of Batad, in Iloilo, after it noted a
clustering of measles cases in the area. The office also recommended
the conducting of random throat swabbing of patients in order to
identify the strain.

Earlier, IPHO warned of a clustering of measles cases in the
municipality of Batad.

Provincial Health Officer Dr. Patricia Grace Trabado reported to
Governor Arthur Defensor Sr. that during the 1st week of September
2011, the staff of Batad Rural Health Unit confirmed 5 measles cases
from Barangays Tanao and Binon-an in Batad. Blood serum taken from a
7-month-old boy and a 12-year-old girl in Barangay Binon-an, and 7-,
15- and 29-year-old patients in Barangay Tanao, was confirmed to be
positive for measles lgM.

IPHO traced the occurrence of measles cases in Batad to a 23-year-old
woman from Pasig City who arrived in Barangay Tapian on 4 May 2011.
This woman, who was suspected to have measles, stayed in Barangay
Tapi-an for 10 days. The following month [June 2011], the 29-year-old
woman resident in Barangay Tapi-an suffered from high-grade fever,
productive cough, conjunctivitis and gradual appearance of
maculopapular rashes. She was suspected to have measles, and a blood
sample was collected, and the blood serum was sent to Iloilo
Provincial Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, which subsequently sent
the samples to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in
Manila for laboratory confirmation. The results released on 28 Jun
2011 confirmed that the woman had measles.

On 28 Sep 2011, IPHO sent a team led by Dr. Maria Socorro Quinon to
Barangays Tanao, Binon-an and Tapi-an to investigate the reported
measles cases. The team found that a 9-month-old baby had measles, and
they also saw an 8-month-old baby manifesting signs and symptoms of
measles, thereby confirming that there is a clustering of measles
cases in the area.

An outbreak of measles in the province of Tungurahua has alerted the
health authorities. Originally appearing in a rural community in the
parish of Quisapincha, it then spread to Ambato evading
epidemiological surveillance controls. The number of suspected cases
of the disease, which on Tue 27 Sep 2011 was 31, had risen to 48 by
Thu 29 Sep 2011, [and according to a more recent report of Tue 4 Oct
2011, the total is now 68. - Mod.CP].

According to the Health Director of the province, the indigenous
population is worst affected due to past reluctance to accept
vaccination A program of measles vaccination is now being implemented
throughout the province.

However, on account of the mobility of the population, especially on
weekdays, it will not be surprising if the disease spreads to other
sectors of the population. Consequently, we must endeavor to protect
children and people who have impaired immunity. It will be a priority
also to spread knowledge of the symptoms of the disease in order that
immediate treatment is sought.

Health Minister, David Chiriboga, confirms that there is a positive
case of measles in the Baca Ortiz Hospital. The patient is a
10-year-old child, and apparently the infection was the result of a
visit from a relative living in Ambato.

Additionally, it has been learned that there are 2 suspected cases in
Quito, one in the north and another in the south of the city.

Minnesota's 2nd measles outbreak of the year [2011], which began when
a Dakota County baby was hospitalized in August 2011, is over, health
officials say. The one-year-old child fell ill after a family trip to
Kenya, where the disease is widespread. After he returned to
Minnesota, a cousin and an unrelated adult also were infected.

No new cases have surfaced since August 2011, according to the
Minnesota Department of Health. Since the infectious period -- usually
about 3 weeks -- has long passed, health officials said they do not
expect any more cases associated with this outbreak. In February and
March 2011, more than 20 children and adults were infected in a
separate outbreak in Hennepin County.

The Health Department continues to advise those traveling overseas to
vaccinate children as young as 6 months if they're going to countries
where outbreaks are common, such as parts of Africa and Europe.

There is no sign that the measles outbreak in Auckland is being
brought under control. The latest weekly update from the regional
health authorities shows 24 new cases in the past week, compared with
11 new cases a fortnight ago.

Some 203 cases have been confirmed since the outbreak began at the end
of May this year [2011]. The authorities say 3 people were in hospital
over the weekend, and 31 have needed hospital care since the latest
outbreak began.

A Wellington student diagnosed with measles has been discharged from
hospital, but it is not clear yet whether this student infected others
in Dunedin during a visit there.

Auckland's medical officer of health Richard Hoskins says there is no
sign of the outbreak abating. Dr Hoskins says it is affecting babies
to people in their 60s, but mainly those under age 4 and those in
their 20s and 30s. Ministry of Health deputy director Darren Hunt says
there is no sign yet of any significant wider spread of measles
throughout the country.

Two of nearly 30 suspected cases of measles in the Bay of Plenty have
been confirmed. Toi Te Ora Public Health is urging people to check on
their vaccinations following the spate of cases in New Zealand, which
until now have mainly been in the Auckland, Waikato and Hawkes Bay
regions.

Toi Te Ora Medical Officer of Health Dr Jim Miller said it appeared
the 2 Bay of Plenty cases were likely to have been acquired out of the
area. "The best way for us to avoid further cases of this potentially
serious infection is for everyone to again ask themselves: 'Is my
family protected,'" Dr Miller said. "With the school holidays and
families travelling around New Zealand and overseas, it's important to
ensure that you and your children are up to date with immunisations in
general and the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine in
particular. Measles immunisation provides effective protection, and
the vaccine is completely free for children and adults. MMR is given
in 2 doses, normally at 15 months and 4 years."
