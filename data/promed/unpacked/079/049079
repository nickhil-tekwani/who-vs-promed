TOMATO INFECTIOUS CHLOROSIS VIRUS - USA (CALIFORNIA)
====================================================
Date: February 1997

Since 1993, a new virus disease has been observed in several
places in California (US), on tomato grown in the field and under
glasshouse. Affected tomato plants showed interveinal yellowing,
necrosis and severe yield losses. The causal agent has been
identified as a new clostero-like virus transmitted by the
whitefly _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_ (but not by _Bemisia
tabaci_) and has been designated as tomato infectious chlorosis
virus. In addition to tomato, it can also infect tomatillo
(_Physalis ixocarpa_), potato (_Solanum tuberosum_), artichoke
(_Cynara scolymus_), lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) and petunia
(_Petunia_ hybrida).
