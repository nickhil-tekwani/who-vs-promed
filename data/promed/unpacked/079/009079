1st report of the causal agent of huanglongbing (_"Candidatus Liberibacter
asiaticus"_) in Brazil

Huanglongbing (ex-greening) disease is one of the most serious diseases of
citrus. It is caused by the phloem-limited, Gram negative bacterium
"_Candidatus Liberibacter_ spp.". This bacterium is not well characterized
mainly because it is still uncultured. There are two known strains, Asian
("_Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_") and African ("_Candidatus
Liberibacter africanus_") that cause severe damage to citrus plants
including twig dieback, decline, and death.
Symptoms first appear as leaf mottling and chlorosis in one shoot or sector
of trees. Later, leaf symptoms resemble nutritional deficiencies (Zn, Ca,
and N) that vary depending on the strains, with more severe symptoms caused
by "_Ca. L. asiaticus_". The Asian strains are transmitted by the Asian
citrus psyllid (AsCP), _Diaphorina citri_, which is present in Brazil.
The bacterium has been detected in citrus plants in many geographic
locations including China, Japan, Thailand, India, the Philippines, the
Arabian Peninsula, and Africa. In 2004, plants showing Huanglongbing
symptoms were observed in Araraquara County, a central region of the State
of Sao Paulo, the largest citrus-producing area in Brazil.
To verify the presence of "_Ca. L._ spp." in these plants, leaf samples of
sweet orange cvs. Hamlin and Valencia were used for DNA extraction and
polymerase chain reaction amplification using the specific OI1 and Oi2c
primers (1). Amplification of the 16S rDNA was positive for 2 (cvs. Hamlin
and Valencia) of 10 analyzed plants. The amplified fragments were cloned
and sequenced.
The amplicons obtained from both plants showed the same sequence, which
differed from "_Ca. L. africanus_", utilized as the positive control in the
amplification experiment (27 divergent bases in 1160). The sequences were
used for BLAST searches, and the results showed identities ranging from
94.71 to 100 percent with "_Ca. L._ spp." sequences available at the
National Center for Biotechnology Information database (online
publication). The highest scores were obtained with "_Ca. L. asiaticus_
sequences. These analyses confirmed the presence of such agent in the State
of Sao Paulo.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of "_Ca. L. asiaticus_" in Brazil
as well as elsewhere in the Americas. The significance of this report
relates to the potential damage that this pathogen could cause to the
citrus industry in the largest citrus-producing country in the world.
It remains unclear how and when the pathogen entered Brazil.

[This the 2nd report of HLB in Brazil; the 1st report was posted to
ProMED-mail on 23 Jul 2004. HLB is the major constraint to citrus
production, affecting 29 countries in Asia and Africa. Infected citrus
trees in Brazil have been by officials to be infected with the most
dangerous strain of HLB ("_Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus_"). Its
arrival in Brazil, coupled with the presence of the psyllid vector
_Diaphorina citri_, signals probable spread to citrus groves in Brazil and
possibly to other citrus-growing areas in South America, thus possibly
exposing citrus groves in Central and North America to infection. The HLB
bacterium infects nearly all citrus species, cultivars, and hybrids and
some citrus relatives.
Prevention of spread is the best control for HLB. HLB symptoms are similar
to other decline diseases such as citrus blight and citrus tristeza and
develop slowly, and infected trees may not be recognized as those of a new
disease. In areas where HLB has been established, management to reduce
losses include propagation of HLB-free trees for planting, reduction of
psyllid populations by removing species which continually flush,
application of insecticides when threshold population levels are attained,
and by pruning symptomatic sectors from infected trees.
