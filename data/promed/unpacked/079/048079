[It is odd that the report was found on the Facebook page of the Ambulance Facility in Kafr al-Sheikh and was not released officially by the government. But [the government has] said that 1037 cases of suspected bird flu (H5N1) since November 2015 all proved negative. The report does not state whether the infecting virus is H5N1, but it is this virus that has been associated with cases in Egypt. Any further information is requested, as well as thoughts on why Egypt continues to report human cases of H5N1 and most other countries, with the exception of a few cases in China, have not in spite of circulation in poultry.

Egypt's 1st recorded bird flu case was in 2006. According to a recent paper, during 2006-2015, the estimated number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection in Egypt was 292, with a 34 per cent case fatality rate (Kayali G, El-Shesheny R, Kandeil A, et al: Avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in Egypt. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016; 22(3) [date cited]. DOI: 10.3201/eid2203.150593; http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/3/15-0593_article).

Flu.gov (http://www.flu.gov/about_the_flu/h5n1/index.html) counts a total of 650 cases of H5N1 in 15 countries in Asia, Africa, the Pacific, Europe, and the Near East since November 2003 with 60 percent mortality.

Most human cases of "highly pathogenic" H5N1 virus infection have occurred in people who had recent contact with sick or dead poultry. In Egypt, 70 percent of cases had exposure to backyard poultry. - Mod.LK]
