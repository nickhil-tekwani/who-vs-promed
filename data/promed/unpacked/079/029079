The Southern Nevada Health District is warning 40 000 people they may
have been exposed to Hepatitis C. In addition, these people may also
have been exposed to Hepatitis B and HIV.

Patients at the Endoscopy Center of Nevada will soon be notified they
should be tested for each of the viruses. The concern stems back to
procedures requiring injected anesthesia at the clinic between March
2004 and 11 Jan 2008.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The nature of this disease security breach is unclear. Hepatitis C,
hepatitis B, and HIV are all blood-borne infections. The
administration of anesthetic in an endoscopy unit would not be
expected to involve transmission of blood. Clarification would be
welcomed. - Mod.CP
