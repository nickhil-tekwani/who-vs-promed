Anthrax hits Saskatchewan bison herd
------------------------------------
Anthrax has killed a third of a bison herd in southern Saskatchewan,
Canada, provincial officials confirmed on Tuesday [10 Aug 2010]. As of
Friday [6 Aug 2010], 30 bison from the 90-animal herd at a Weyburn-area
farm were dead, officials said.

Greg Douglas, the chief veterinary officer with the agriculture ministry,
is warning livestock producers to consider vaccinating their herds against
the disease. While anthrax is rarely a problem for humans, it can be deadly
for animals. "What we see is sudden-death loss," Douglas said. "The animals
are absolutely normal-looking and 2 hours later they're dead. They don't
give any warning, it's not a situation where an animal will be off feed or
just won't be right for a while. They are fine one moment and they are dead
the next." The cost of vaccinating is much less than the cost of replacing
an animal, Douglas said.

Following widespread flooding in May and June [2010], conditions are ideal
for the anthrax spores that are naturally present in prairie soil to infect
more animals this year [2010], he said. "As the animals start to chew off
the grass in low-lying areas that could have been flooded, they're going to
be exposed to anthrax spores," he said. "If they have no immunity then we
could end up with more anthrax cases through August and September [2010]."

The worst year for anthrax in Saskatchewan was 2006, when more than 800
cattle and bison died.

Anthrax case in Saskatchewan
----------------------------
No area in the province should consider itself immune to an anthrax
scenario. The province has recorded its 1st case for 2010. It's in the RM
[rural municipality] of Wellington south east of Regina near Weyburn. And
it's affecting a bison herd. About half the 90 head herd has died so far.

The chief veterinary officer with Saskatchewan Agriculture, Dr Greg
Douglas, says with the amount of water and flooding that we had this spring
[2010] it's plausible that many of the pastures that didn't previously have
any problems could now be contaminated. Douglas says all producers in the
province should consider vaccinating their animals for anthrax and no area
of the province should consider itself immune. Having said that, there are
higher risk areas. Those are areas where there was substantial flooding,
those that have had anthrax cases within the past 5 years, and those where
the soil is alkaline or basic.

Vaccination is the best method of protection for cattle, sheep, goats, and
horses. The vaccine requires 7 to 10 days for immunity to develop and will
provide protection for 6 to 12 months.

Douglas says watching for signs of the disease before deciding whether or
not to vaccinate is not the way to go because anthrax really is a sudden
death in a herd. He says everything can look fine and the signs of disease
are so quick producers won't have the opportunity to act. The animal can go
from being seemingly completely fine to being dead in 2 hours time.

Saskatchewan had a serious anthrax problem in 2006; 804 livestock deaths
were reported, mainly in north east, north central, and east central
regions. These included 493 cattle, 253 bison, 33 sheep, 13 deer and elk,
as well as 6 horses.

"The 1st case of anthrax in Saskatchewan for 2010 has occurred in the
southern part of the province. The infected herd is a bison herd consisting
of 500 animals, 100 of which are on a separate pasture where approximately
30 have died. The deaths include 100 per cent of the bulls, and about 30
per cent of the females.

The carcass-side screening test kit was used by the CFIA [Canadian Food
Inspection Agency] district vet, following a postmortem by a private
veterinarian on 1 Aug 2010, after the producer reported 10 deaths. Given
negative results to the screening test, other reasons for deaths were
explored. Blue green algae were ruled out.

A 2nd private veterinarian examined the herd and performed a postmortem on
3 Aug 2010, as death losses continued. The only finding was an enlarged
spleen, consistent with anthrax, but preliminary smears at a private lab
were inconclusive. Anthrax was confirmed by the CFIA lab on 6 Aug 2010, on
samples collected from the 1st animal tested on 1 Aug 2010. Culture results
at the private lab on the 3 Aug 2010 sample were also considered highly
suspicious of anthrax, and were forwarded to the CFIA lab on 5 Aug 2010
with anthrax confirmation on 6 Aug 2010.

CFIA tested 2 more dead animals on 4 Aug 2010, as deaths continued. These 2
animals had a negative result and a weak positive result with the
carcass-side test, which were confirmed by CFIA lab results of one negative
and one positive on anthrax culture.

Deaths, including calves, continued throughout this past weekend [7-8 Aug
2010] (exact numbers being confirmed). Antibiotics had been started and
therefore vaccination will be delayed, but will proceed once antibiotic
treatments cease. All carcasses have been, or are being buried, with C&D
[control and disinfection] efforts continuing.

An update will be provided as information becomes available.

Comment: The false negative results of the pen-side screening test may have
delayed confirmation of this infection. Continued testing was required to
confirm anthrax in this herd. Postmortems may be necessary in such cases,
and must be done with care to reduce contamination. Questions are being
posed regarding the sensitivity of this screening test for use in bison.

[This outbreak is very similar to that on the Flying-D ranch in Montana,
USA, in 2008. The 1st thing to do in these circumstances is to get the herd
out of the pasture, and get them treated and vaccinated. The 100 per cent
death rate among bison bulls is not unusual, but costly.

How the rains played a part is probably 2-fold:
1. providing a good hatch of horse flies to spread the infection through
the herd, and
2. it probably floated up the spores in the various (?bison) graves from
previous cases on this or other nearby ranches.

Cattle and bison are large creatures and therefore any grave of these
animals will collapse inwards as the carcasses decompose to produce a
modest basin. This/these will collect rain, provide extra grazing, and move
any spores to the surface where they can be acquired by animals grazing the
site.

Why the US Navy test kits were not up to their expected efficiency is
unclear at this time. The usual reason for false negatives are
inappropriate species (white tail deer always come up negative) but we have
had consistent good success with plains bison and wood bison elsewhere. The
other regular problem is when the carcasses are tested after too long an
interval after death. With cattle, tests will go negative around the 3rd
day as decomposition will reduce the titre of protective antigen below the
test threshold for positivity. A preliminary answer from my CFIA colleagues
indicates that they believe that one of these false negative carcasses was
"fresh" as was the weak positive. CFIA obtains fresh test kits each year
for distribution. - Mod.MHJ
