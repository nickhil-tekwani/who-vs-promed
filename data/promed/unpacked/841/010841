Five countries in West Africa including Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger and Ghana are in a full subregional meeting about anthrax, commonly called la fievre charbonneuse (black fever), a disease affecting both humans and animals.

At this 2-day meeting that ends today [29 Sep 2015] in Lome [Togo], attended by the representatives of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], and by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE], and the West African Economic and Monetary Union [WAEMU]. The target [was] to provide a better understanding of the epidemiology of anthrax and factors that promote its persistence in the subregion.

According to organizers, many major challenges lie ahead for effective control of anthrax in West Africa. There is, amongst other items, a lack of local-level knowledge about the risks posed by anthrax to animal and public health, the absence of or delay of answers given by the veterinary services, lack of appropriate strategy to control the disease, and lack of collaboration between public health and the veterinary services. There is also a lack of awareness causing risky social-cultural practices -- including the slaughter of sick animals, the consumption or handling of meat from infected animals and the abandonment of carcasses in the open air.

At this meeting of specialists, ways will be discussed to strengthen capacities in animal health, such as ways of prevention surveillance, vaccination of livestock, and suitable disposal of livestock carcasses.

It should be noted that anthrax causes outbreaks every year, the deaths of thousands of head of cattle, and affects many people. According to Ahmed El-Idrissi, senior officer, Animal Health, FAO, "The meeting provides an opportunity to provide an update on the current state of anthrax in cattle and humans, as well as control programs in target countries." In Lome sub-region, specialists in animal health are also looking into the possibility of undertaking epidemiological studies.

[The countries attending the meeting are among those whose domestic animals are the most affected by the anthrax bacteria. They know the common failures in the fight against this serious, but neglected, zoonotic disease.

These failures can be as follows:
1) the risks of misunderstandings of the disease in humans through the slaughter of sick animals, consumption or handling of meat from infected animals, and the abandonment of animal carcasses outdoors;
2) insufficient technical and human resources available to the veterinary services;
3) the lack of collaboration between public health and veterinary services. - Mod.AB

Thanks to the general weakness of many West African government veterinary services, there is a poor appreciation of the true extent of this disease in livestock and wildlife in the region. The genomic structure of the strains specific to West Africa has barely begun to be sorted out, though it has many characteristics that seem to be unique (sensu strictu) to this part of Africa. - Mod.MHJ]
