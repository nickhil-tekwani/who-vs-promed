A deadly disease that initially started to affect deer on Vancouver Island [British Columbia] in 2020 is still spreading in local populaces, the provincial government recently announced.

A CTV News report said, according to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Forests, Land, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, out of 36 dead deer examined by the ministry since the beginning of the year [2021], 22 have had adenovirus hemorrhagic disease or AHD.

AHD was originally detected in 1993 in California, although it had never been discovered in British Columbia until September last year [2020], as reported in British Columbia News.

The province officials said this disease typically kills deer fast by leading to impairment to small blood vessels in the lungs and intestines.

Nonetheless, it can result in chronic diseases, including ulcers and abscesses in the mouth and throat of a deer.

According to the BC government, there is no evidence of AHD transmission to humans, pets, or livestock. Nonetheless, hunters are still being cautioned not to eat any meat from deer, specifically, those that have been found dead, appear ill, or are acting abnormally before they died.

The ministry said it continues to investigate the transmission and persistence of the disease, and it is asking whoever sees dear with AHD to contact [the ministry].

In an email, the spokesperson said the province remains interested in collecting more specimens for ongoing investigation and welcome reports of deer, regardless of age, with clinical indications of foaming and drooling at the mouth, dark-colored diarrhea, and difficulty breathing...

[This adenovirus (CdAdV-1 or OdAdV-1) was 1st recognized in California in 1993, as stated in the text, where it caused fatal hemorrhagic disease in black-tailed deer (_Odocoileus columbianus_). The virus is closely related to bovine adenovirus-3, but the biologic properties of both viruses are clearly distinct, and CdAdV-1does not cause disease in other animals than deer. Mortalities due to CdAdV-1 infection have been documented in black-tailed deer and moose. Wild populations of other cervid species, such as white-tailed deer, mule deer, and elk, are also sporadically infected. - Mod.PMB
