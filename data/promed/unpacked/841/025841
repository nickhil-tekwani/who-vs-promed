Egg shortage begins
--------------------
Shoppers experienced the first egg shortages on Monday, as the nationwide
ban on transporting poultry products began to bite. And with only 2 weeks
to go until Easter, egg and poultry exports from the Netherlands have come
to a complete standstill following the outbreak of avian or bird flu, the
BBC reported.
The Dutch Minister of Agriculture Cees Veerman ordered a halt last Friday
on exports of live chickens and eggs as well as a ban on movements within
the country.
The Netherlands is one of the biggest producers of eggs and poultry in the
world, and in many European countries coloured or carefully painted eggs
are a central part of the Easter festivities.
The deadly poultry flu first appeared on chicken farms in Gelderland
province at the beginning of March, and some 9 million chickens were culled
to stop it spreading. On Fri, 4 Apr 2003, it was reported avian flu had
reached a farm in north Brabant province -- the heartland of the Dutch
poultry industry. There are 50 million chickens in the province. The virus
was also detected on a farm in Limburg province, home to some 12 million
farm chickens.
The supply of eggs held by distributors is being exhausted and cannot be
replaced because of the transport ban, the Dutch egg sector organisation
ANEVEI said on Monday. "Available supplies are very scarce, while consumer
demand is high as everyone tries to stock up on eggs," a spokesman for the
association said.
Trying to fill up the gap with eggs from abroad is difficult, the group
warned, because there is little supply available.
The food retailers organisation CBL was less pessimistic and claimed the
run on eggs would be compensated by the importation of fresh egg supplies
from abroad.
Minister Veerman was due to decide on Monday whether to continue the ban
through this week.
Dutch poultry and egg exports were valued at EUR 1.8 billion in 2001,
according to the country's Product Boards for Livestock, Meat and Eggs
(PVE). "This is a complete disaster. It is not a question of how many
businesses and farms will go down, but how many will be left standing once
this is all over", a spokesman for the PVE said.

Current situation re Avian Influenza
------------------------------------
The minister's letter included the following chapters:
1. Spread to Limburg
2. Recruiting the army
3. Vaccination
4. Results of investigations in wild birds
Due to their significance from an epidemiological point of view, the
translated text of the following 2 chapters is included below:
1. Vaccination
--------------
Implementation of vaccination as a possible control measure has been
suggested by some. In my letter of 5 Mar 2003 [see ref 20030306.0552] I
have already indicated that vaccination cannot be applied as an alternative
control measure. Experience gathered in Italy has clearly demonstrated that
vaccination might be beneficial only if applied when it is absolutely
certain that no virus is circulating anymore. On top of that, a test to
detect the virus currently present in Netherlands is not yet available.
Moreover, it takes several weeks before the vaccination becomes effective
[renders protection]. Therefore, a decision regarding preventive
vaccination may become an issue for discussion only when the AI crisis is over.
2. Results of monitoring of wild birds
--------------------------------------
At my request, scientists of Erasmus University in Rotterdam looked at the
infection of wild birds, because they might be a source of dispersion of
the virus.
85 samples from 24 avian species were collected in the Gelders Valley and
tested for the presence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) virus.
4 tame ducks and 3 mute swans, sampled in the vicinity of 3 infected
poultry farms in Renswoude, were found infected with HPAI H7N7. All 7
infected birds were "kept animals" that lived around farms, and not wild,
free-roaming birds. It is highly probable that the infection came from
neighboring farms.
All others results were negative, which means that the birds were not infected.
These results correspond with earlier investigations carried out in 1300
poultry farms for the presence of Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) in
the Netherlands. Based upon their negative results, I have already
concluded, in my letter of 19 Mar 2003, that there is no widespread
presence of LPAI virus in the Netherlands.

[The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture announced today, 8 Apr 2003, that the
total accumulated number of "definitely infected" premises has reached 197,
of which 12 were non-commercial enterprises which keep pet-birds. There are
now 21 "seriously suspected" premises, of which 7 are non-commercial. 10.7
million AI-susceptible animals, in 748 farms, have been culled so far.
The EU announced that, due to the proximity of the Limburg province to
Germany and Belgium, coordination will be increased between the 3 countries
on measures to be taken. The issue is to be discussed on Tue, 8 Apr 2003,
in the Agricultural Council in Luxembourg at the request of Netherlands,
and on Tue/Wed, 8-9 Apr 2003, by the SCoFCAH (Standing Committee for the
Food Chain and Animal Health) scheduled to review the disease situation and
the control measures. - Mod.AS]
