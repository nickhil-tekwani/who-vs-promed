The Canadian government is very optimistic that isolated cases of
anthrax in Alberta's cattle herd are under control with no further
outbreaks reported since the last one occurred 21 Sep 1999, an
official with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said. The
cases have been confined to a 10 mile area around Rocky
Mountain House, Alberta.
Dr. George Luterbach, program manager for the western division
of the animal health department of the CFIA, an arm of Agriculture
and Agri-Food Canada, said that the disease is under control. He
indicated there were cases on several farms in the region going
back over the last several months.
"There have been several weeks between the last reported incident
and the second last case," he said. For the first 5 cases of the
disease, the period of time between the discovery was roughly a
week." Luterbach noted the cattle in the area in question have now
been vaccinated as well as quarantined for 30 days to determine
whether or not the disease has been [controlled.
"No animals are currently moving off the farm," he said adding that
there was no evidence to suggest that the disease was spreading
from farm to farm.
Luterbach said that while anthrax is not common to any region in
Canada, what was unique about the cases near Rocky Mountain
House was the climatic conditions. He said a dry spring allowed
animals in the region to graze in lower areas which normally does
not occur. And when combined with a cool humid summer the
chances of spreading the disease among the cattle were much
greater.

[It would be interesting to know what happened between the ultimate
& penultimate cases to bring on the last case. There is still much to
be learnt from this series of cases. - MHJ
