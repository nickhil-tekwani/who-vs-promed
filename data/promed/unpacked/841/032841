French officials have slaughtered 127 cattle after a case of mad cow
disease was found in the Manche department in Normandy, the agriculture
ministry announced on Monday.
It was the seventh mad cow case this year in France and the 38th since the
disease -- officially known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE --
appeared in 1990.
The ministry said the infected animal was a Prim'Holstein milk cow born in
July 1989 in the area. The whole herd was destroyed at the end of last week.
