SCRAPIE, RAM - USA (MONTANA)

The first laboratory confirmed case of scrapie in Montana has been found in
a 3.5 year-old ram located on a small farm in southwestern Montana,
according to Montana State Veterinarian Dr. Arnold Gertonson.
"Transmittal of the disease within the flock or from the flock to other
animals is not expected," Gertonson said. "The animal has been destroyed
and the epidemiology investigation is continuing to determine if other
sheep in Montana are at risk."
A flock plan has been developed with the flock owner including the
destruction of the affected animal. Rams are not known to transmit the
disease. Infected females have a high probability for transmission. There
is no treatment for the disease, and once an animal is affected, there is
no cure. The disease is confirmed by histological examination of the brain
from animals having shown clinical signs of the disease. "There is no
officially recognized test for the presence of scrapie in live animals,"
Gertonson said.
Owners of infected or source flocks must either conduct a postexposure
monitoring and management plan for 5 years after the last scrapie-positive
or high-risk animal is removed, or participate in the National Voluntary
Scrapie Flock Certification Program (VSFCP), complete monitored category,
and remain in compliance with the standards for exposed flocks for 5 years
after the last scrapie-positive or high-risk animal is removed. The VSFCP
is administered by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and cooperating
state animal health authorities. "The owner has already complied with the
state and federal requirements," Gertonson said. Montana is a Scrapie
Compliant State. "Livestock producers, hobby farmers and ranchers need to
make sure they purchase sheep from certified scrapie-free flocks,"
Gertonson added.
Scrapie is a slowly progressive disease causing a degeneration of the
central nervous system. It was first recognized as a disease of sheep in
Great Britain and other countries of Western Europe more than 250 years
ago. Since then, the disease has been reported throughout the world.
The first case of scrapie in the United States was diagnosed in 1947 in a
Michigan flock. The Michigan flock owner had imported sheep of British
origin through Canada for several years.
In 1999, there were 29 confirmed cases of scrapie reported in the United
States. Over 900 flocks in the United States have been diagnosed with the
disease since it was introduced in 1947, the majority occurring in the
eastern portion of the country. Scrapie has been diagnosed in flocks in 45
of the 50 states. In the United States, scrapie has primarily been reported
in the Suffolk breed. It has also been diagnosed in Cheviots, Corriedales,
Dorsets, Hampshires, Finn sheep, Merinos, Shropshires, Montadales,
Southdowns, Rambouillets, and a number of crossbreeds.
Cases of scrapie have also been reported in goats raised in contact with
sheep. There is no scientific evidence scrapie of sheep and goats is
transmitted to humans.
Clinical signs for scrapie vary widely among individual animals and develop
very slowly. Early signs include subtle changes in behavior or temperament,
incoordination, and muscle tremors; and may be followed by scratching and
rubbing against fixed objects, apparently to relieve itching. Several other
problems can cause clinical signs similar to scrapie in sheep, including
the diseases ovine progressive pneumonia, listeriosis, and rabies; the
presence of external parasites; pregnancy toxemia; and toxins.

[ProMED-mail does not routinely report on scrapie, which is not an emerging
infectious disease. This report has been selected for posting because
scrapie is uncommon in rams, Montana has not had scrapie for 3-5 years or
longer, and the historical background provided is useful. - Mods.TG/ES]
