The cases reports described are interesting, but it may be a bit
premature to conclude that the epidemiology is changing. It would
be important to know exactly where the travellers stayed.
The Dominican Republic is endemic for malaria, [which is]
very present in rural areas. There is normally little or no risk in most
resorts, but cases are seen once in a while. Another phenomenon
that occurs is that new resorts are created in places that are not
malaria free.
About 100 000 travellers from Quebec province go to the
Dominican Republic every year and we have not seen cases of
malaria recently, which seems to indicate a localized phenomenon:
one particular resort area, possibly a new one.
I don't think every traveller to the Dominican Republic should
receive antimalarials; the risk is just too low. This is why it is
important to identify the area; only travellers going to that area
could be prophylaxed.
For completion, it is also necessary to specify the diagnostic
criteria that were used.
