RE: Tularemia, rabbits - USA (NM)
---------------------------------
Sometimes our press releases are only partially covered in the media
which leads to a lack of information for ProMED. Our rabbit
population cycles up and down every few years and has recently been
fairly high, at least in the northern part of New Mexico. When the
populations are high we tend to see die offs due to both tularemia
and plague. This can then lead to cases in cats and dogs that are
allowed to roam and hunt, and potentially in people.

We have had laboratory confirmed tularemia in 2 rabbits, one from an
area called La Cienega (several miles southwest of the city of Santa
Fe, picked up dead on 9 Apr 2009) and another one from just west of
the city limits of Santa Fe (picked up dead on 8 Apr 2009). We also
had a dead rabbit from the north end of Santa Fe (picked up dead on
31 Mar 2009) that tested positive for plague, _Yersinia pestis_.
[This is being posted, see ProMEDmail 20090415.1435. - Mod.MHJ] There
were no human or pet cases associated with these dead rabbits and no
antibiotic prophylaxis was needed. We feel it is important to give an
early warning to the public that these diseases, while rare, are
circulating in the environment. We also give information to the
public on things they can do to help decrease their risk of being
exposed to these diseases.

It is difficult to predict whether animal cases in early spring will
translate to an increase in human cases (there was only one human
case of plague and one human case of tularemia in New Mexico in 2008)
as many environmental factors come into play, especially rainfall and
temperature. I also believe that modifying human behavior can go a
long way to reducing risk and the number of human and pet cases,
hence our news release warnings.

Our one New Mexico plague case in 2008 was due to a person skinning a
sick rabbit bare-handed.

Department of Health warns about tularemia in rabbits
------------------------------------------------------
The New Mexico Department of Health is warning people that rabbits
are getting sick and dying from a bacterial disease called tularemia.
Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian,
encourages people to follow the same precautions they would to avoid
plague: Don't allow pets to roam and hunt, use a tick/flea control
product on pets and don't handle sick or dead rodents or rabbits.

"We have received several phone calls over the last 2 weeks from
concerned citizens in Santa Fe County who have found dead rabbits
near their homes or in recreational areas that they frequent,"
Ettestad said. "We have tested several of these rabbits and 2 of them
have come back positive for tularemia, one from the La Cienega area
and one from west of the city of Santa Fe near the 599 Relief Route.
Other reports of sick and dead rabbits have come from areas near Lamy
and Edgewood."

The Department is not collecting any more rabbits from these areas,
but asks people to use a shovel to either bury the dead rabbits in
the ground or to double bag them in the trash if they are allowed to
dispose of them in this manner. This will help keep pets from chewing
on the dead animals and becoming infected.
