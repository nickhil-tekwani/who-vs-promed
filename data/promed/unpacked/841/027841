Brucellosis was found in 2 districts of the Turkestan region. Sick animals were identified during a routine examination. Their owners will be paid the due compensation for the cattle sent for slaughter, but free grazing of the rest is still prohibited to them.

In 2 villages of the Kazygurt region, 7 cows and 31 sheep were infected. In Saryagash, 14 and 24, respectively. Among the people who were in contact with animals, brucellosis was not detected.

In these farms, an additional testing of all livestock has been undertaken. Restrictive measures have been established and agricultural land and premises are being disinfected, the veterinary service of the Department of Agriculture of the Turkestan region explained.

In one large farm, where one of the infection foci is located, there are 155 heads of cattle, about 1000 sheep and more than 100 horses. All livestock will be kept in the yard for the time being. Grazing will be allowed only after 2 consecutive negative tests.

If the number of infected cattle increases, the entire animal population of such villages will be quarantined. Since the beginning of the year [2022], 76 cases of brucellosis have been registered in the region.

[Brucellosis is considered hyperendemic in Kazakhstan. A similar situation prevails in several other regional republics of the former Soviet Union (Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan).

_Brucella melitensis_, of which small ruminants (sheep, goats) are the reservoir, is the main pathogen circulating in these countries, with a steadily increasing rate of spillover to cattle.

Most strains recovered from human patients in Kazakhstan have, traditionally, been identified as _B. melitensis_. The control and, eventual, eradication of _B. melitensis_ is a complex undertaking, combining reporting of abortions, mass serological tests, vaccinations and, when necessary, culling of severely infected flocks. Such a project requires close cooperation between the farmers and the various authorities (public and animal health institutions). Adequate and timely payment of compensations for culled animals is a prerequisite.

The forecast for controlling brucellosis in Kazakhstan, which depends on the quality of diagnostic measures and the timely adoption of measures for the immediate destruction of sick animals, is unfavorable. Outbreaks of the disease are expected to continue among small ruminants in the southern and eastern regions, and among cattle in the eastern, western and northern regions of Kazakhstan (see "Analysis of the epizootic situation on animal brucellosis in Kazakhstan in 2020" by Telmanova et al, at https://elibrary.ru/item.asp?id=45752452, in Russian). - Mod.AS
