A rare pulmonary disease that is linked to bats has made Alberta home, according to new research led by provincial lab scientists.

Infectious disease experts at Alberta Precision Laboratories (APL) and the University of Alberta have confirmed that histoplasmosis -- a fungal infection transmitted through bat and bird droppings -- is now found in Alberta. Their study extends the known range of the disease much further northwest from its traditional home in the central USA and parts of southern Ontario and Quebec.

"We were surprised at how many cases were locally acquired, as histoplasmosis has always been considered a travel-related infection," said Dr. Tanis Dingle, APL's lead clinical microbiologist for fungal diseases and an assistant professor in the U of A's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. "We now know that it is definitely living in Alberta and has the potential to infect people who come in contact with it."

The fungus can be present in contaminated dust particles, and when inhaled, patients experience respiratory infections with flu-like symptoms, including cough, fever, chills, and headache. Cases are typically related to individuals who have come in contact with bat or bird droppings in old homes, churches, construction sites, and parks.

Among 45 confirmed cases of histoplasmosis in Alberta between 2011 and 2018, the researchers used epidemiologic data and genetic analysis to determine that 15 of the cases were locally acquired. The cases were primarily found in rural areas in central Alberta, including Sundre, Stettler, Stony Plain, and Spruce Grove.

Previously, the geographic range of the fungus was not thought to expand further northwest than Minnesota, some 2000 km away. The results of the study were published this month [April 2021] in the medical journal The Lancet Microbe. In addition, early looks at the study led scientists at the CDC to include the region in newly drawn maps of areas where the disease is known to occur.

"Knowing that histoplasmosis is here can help improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients who have no history of travel to the traditional risk areas," said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor, division of infectious diseases, U of A. "Histoplasmosis can be a challenging disease to diagnose and to treat, and patients often spend months before the correct diagnosis is made. Awareness that the disease is here is an essential 1st step for doctors to be able to consider the diagnosis and order the appropriate tests."

The researchers are also exploring whether climate change could be a factor in the spread of histoplasmosis to new places. In Alberta, increasing temperatures and decreasing precipitation have been documented over the past several decades, which might have resulted in more favorable conditions for _Histoplasma_ to live in Alberta soils.

[Global warming is contributing to the spread of multiple infectious diseases. As a review, the following was obtained from Medscape (http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/299054-overview#showall):

"_Histoplasma capsulatum_ is a dimorphic fungus that remains in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals. Infection causes histoplasmosis. Although the fungus that causes histoplasmosis can be found in temperate climates throughout the world, it is endemic to the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys in the United States. Internationally, the fungus is predominantly found in river valleys in North and Central America, eastern and southern Europe, and parts of Africa, eastern Asia, and Australia.

The soil in areas endemic for histoplasmosis provides an acidic, damp environment with high organic content that is good for mycelial growth. Highly infectious soil is found near areas inhabited by bats and birds. Birds cannot be infected by the fungus and do not transmit the disease; however, bird excretions contaminate the soil, thereby enriching the growth medium for the mycelium. In contrast, bats can become infected, and they transmit histoplasmosis through droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Outbreaks of histoplasmosis have been associated with construction and renovation activities that disrupt contaminated soil. In addition, travelers to endemic areas are at risk for histoplasmosis because airborne spores can travel hundreds of feet.

Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. _Histoplasma_ species may remain latent in healed granulomas and recur, if there is impairment of cell-mediated immunity.

Approximately 90 per cent of patients are asymptomatic. If symptoms develop, onset occurs 3-14 days after exposure. Fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, abdominal pain, and chills are common symptoms; usually, histoplasmosis is self-limited. Individuals exposed to a large inoculum may develop severe dyspnea resulting from diffuse pulmonary involvement. Joint pain and skin lesions occur in 5-6 per cent of patients, mostly in females. Enlarged hilar [the hilum is part of a gland or organ, in this case the lung, through which ducts, nerves, or blood vessels enter and leave] and mediastinal lymph nodes are present in 5-10 per cent of patients. Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and/or chest pain may be present and are related to the degree of compression on the pulmonary airway and circulation. Paratracheal involvement may cause cough or dyspnea because of compression on the trachea or bronchi." - Mod.LL

Background:
The classic geographical range of histoplasmosis in North America primarily includes the states and provinces adjacent to the Ohio, Mississippi, and St Lawrence riverways. Although Alberta, Canada is not typically considered a region of risk for histoplasmosis, cases with suspected local acquisition have been reported. We aimed to investigate the epidemiology and geographical distribution of cases of histoplasmosis in Alberta to assess evidence for local acquisition of infections, using genomic analysis for corroboration.

Methods:
We did an epidemiological and genomic investigation, in which laboratory-confirmed cases of histoplasmosis were reviewed in Alberta from 2011, when the disease became reportable, until 2018. We used data attained from Alberta Health. Travel and exposure histories and clinical features were reviewed. Definite local acquisition was defined as a case without previous travel outside Alberta or associated with a common-source outbreak within the province, whereas probable local acquisition was a sporadic case with travel outside Alberta but compelling local exposures. Genomes of selected case isolates were analysed, including those from cases suspected to have been locally acquired and imported.

Findings:
Between Jan 1, 2011, and June 30, 2018, 45 cases of histoplasmosis were identified. Participants had a median age of 53 years (range 17-77) and 32 [71%] were male. Among 34 patients with documented travel histories, ten (29%) had never left the province. 11 cases were of definite local acquisition, including eight cases from three common-source outbreaks and three sporadic cases in patients who had never travelled outside Alberta. The common-source outbreaks all involved exposure to bats or their droppings in chimneys or attics of private dwellings or churches. Four patients had travelled outside Alberta but compelling evidence was seen for local exposure to bat guano. Genome sequencing showed that isolates from cases of definite and probable local acquisition clustered together and were genetically distinct from isolates from suspected imported cases and other published isolates.

Interpretation:
Using epidemiological and genomic analyses, we established that cases of histoplasmosis have been acquired in Alberta, thus expanding the geographical range of Histoplasma spp much further northwest than was previously appreciated. Histoplasmosis should be considered in patients with compatible symptoms outside areas of classic geographical risk.
