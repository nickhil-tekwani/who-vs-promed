* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: As part of the 2015 annual monitoring for the detection of diseases in cattle, a positive serology for bluetongue was detected. PCR is currently being implemented by the laboratory for animal diagnostics. The area where this occurrence was detected is a tropical wet area and is located in the eastern part of the country.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Laboratory for animal diagnostic (national laboratory) / cattle / competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) / 8 Jan 2016 / Positive

[The following information was obtained from the fact sheet "Bluetongue," prepared by The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/bluetongue.pdf (last update June 2015):
"Bluetongue is a viral disease of ruminants transmitted by midges in the genus Culicoides. Bluetongue virus is very diverse: there are more than 2 dozen serotypes, and viruses can reassort to form new variants. Bluetongue virus can replicate in many species of ruminants, often asymptomatically. Clinical cases tend to occur mainly in sheep, but cattle, goats, South American camelids, wild or zoo ruminants, farmed cervids and some carnivores are occasionally affected. Cases range in severity from mild to rapidly fatal, and animals that survive may be debilitated. Additional economic costs result from reproductive losses, damaged wool and decreased milk production. Control of this vector-borne disease is difficult, except by vaccination. The existence of multiple serotypes complicates control, as immunity to 1 serotype may not be cross-protective against others.

Bluetongue virus can be found worldwide within tropical and subtropical climates from approximately 35 deg S to 40 deg N, and in some areas outside this region (e.g., in parts of California, [USA]). Endemic areas exist in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North and South America and Asia, as well as on numerous islands (e.g., Australia, the South Pacific, the Caribbean). Multiple serotypes can be found in many regions".

The following information was provided by Dr. Javier Vargas, Animal Health director, AGROCALIDAD and Dr. Alexandra Burbano, Chief of Epidemiological Surveillance: "Within its system of surveillance, AGROCALIDAD annually monitors for cattle diseases to detect both foreign and endemic diseases and thus implement any established control actions using risk-based criteria".

We thank Dr. Vargas and Dr. Burbano for providing this useful additional information related to this event.

Napo is a province in Ecuador that contains the Napo River. The province is among many located in Ecuador's section of the Amazon Rainforest. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napo_Province
