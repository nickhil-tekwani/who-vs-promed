[All the recent anthrax outbreaks in Slovakia after a 15-year gap have occurred in Presov -- 3 in 2010 and 2 in 2012 -- with the former in and around Svidnik, listed as Sobos and Okrule.

For Svidnik, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LO/05/Svidnik.html. For Okruhle, 13.5 km south of Svidnik, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/LO/05/Okruhle.html. Sobos is 3.8 km south of Okruhle.

And as the OIE report states, we are probably looking at a recurrence in relation to a 2010 anthrax grave best handled by instituting regular annual spring vaccinations for at least the next 5 years on these farms recently affected, 10 years if cautious.

How these outbreaks came about in 2010 and 2012 after a long gap is unclear. The 2 2012 outbreaks in Staskovce, Stropkov county, were ascribed to an old grave site. The 2010 outbreaks were never sorted out. With reasonable luck, 5 years of annual vaccination may stop them from recurring. - Mod.MHJ
