[Yili (Ili), an autonomous prefecture for Kazakh people, is one of 5 autonomous prefectures in Xinjiang. It is situated in north Xinjiang and bordered by Mongolia, Russian Federation, and Republic of Kazakhstan (Almaty province) on the northeast to southwest, with a boundary line of 2019 km [1255 mi] (map at https://tinyurl.com/5389xh4d).

As can be seen on the Pig Site interactive African swine fever [ASF] map (https://tinyurl.com/89k99ccu), presenting OIE-reported ASF outbreaks in China, Mongolia, Russia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, North Korea, and Viet Nam, the most recent ASF outbreak in Xinjiang, in "Red Star 2nd Farm" (red/violet sign), was reported to the OIE in February 2021. It was the 4th ASF outbreak in Xinjiang since the introduction of ASF to China (August 2018). The 3 earlier outbreaks are signed as blue dots (details of each outbreak produced by clicking on the dot).

According to a recent analysis, the heavy economic losses caused by ASF to China's pig industry and its impact upon pork availability contributed indirectly to the spread of COVID-19 (see ProMed archive no. 20210315.8249619). - Mod.AS
