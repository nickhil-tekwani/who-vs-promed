[Note additional complication of probable leptospirosis. - Mod.CHC
There have been 20,962 suspected cases presenting at Ministry of Health
facilities since the epidemic began in mid-December with 1,178 admissions,
primarily for those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. There have been 11
deaths to date, the most recent occurring on February 26 in Nadi. Vector
Control teams, supported by a consultant from the Pacific Community have
been travelling to affected areas to develop long term, individualised
surveillance and response plans to eliminate mosquito breeding sites in
affected urban areas.
DMO Western reported an overall decline in cases in the past three weeks,
with no cases seen or admitted in Tavua or Rakiraki for the last two weeks.
Other areas in the West reported similar declines (see table below).
SDMO Cakaudrove reported that Savusavu Hospital has seen 419 suspected
cases since the 7th of January, and admitted at least 139 serious cases
(this is a revised estimate) since January 2. Last weekÂ’s report of only 13
cases was in error. In fact, at least 59 suspected cases were seen in the
outpatient department, and there were 8 admissions on Tuesday, and 4 over
the weekend for more serious cases.
Further, there has been at least one suspected death [death not suspect,
etiology of death suspect, and one other likely case of leptospirosis
reported in Savusavu in the past month. Health authorities in the area
should be on the alert, as leptospirosis is often hard to distinguish from
dengue, but unlike dengue, is treatable with antibiotics, and serious
complications often develop if untreated. There was also a recent death due
to leptospirosis reported from Taveuni. Leptospirosis is spread from
animals such as cattle, dogs, and pigs to humans, primarily through urine,
and recent heavy rains make transmission more likely.
Kadavu Island has reported 345 cases of dengue since the epidemic began,
with 86 admissions to date. There continue to be reports of cases from
Kadavu. Lakeba island has also seen 269 cases to date, giving an overall
attack rate of more than 10% (the highest in the country), as the outer
islands which make up Lakeba subdivision have not been reporting cases.
In Labasa Hospital, there were at least 33 suspected dengue cases seen in
the last week, with 12 testing positive for dengue, and 6 admissions.
There have been 276 suspected cases seen to date, with 33 admissions, and
54 dengue positives. There seems to be continuing transmission of the
dengue virus at a low level in the Labasa area, with more intense
transmission in Savusavu.
