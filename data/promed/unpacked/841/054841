17000 turkeys will be culled on a fattening unit in the district of
Kleve after a preliminary test revealed the presence of an LPAI H7
virus. The H7 subtype of avian influenza is probably a virus with low
morbidity and mortality rate for poultry, as the district of Kleve on
Friday [3 Apr 2009] announced. Further samples are investigated by
the NRL (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut) on the island of Riems and
results are expected early next week [beginning 6 Apr 2009]. The
application of further precautionary measures, such as implementation
of restriction zones, and their scope depend upon the laboratory results.

[Laboratory results, including the full identity of the pathogen and
confirmation of its alleged low pathogenicity, are expected soon. H7,
of either high or low pathogenicity, is an OIE-notifiable Avian
Influenza (NAI) virus. -Mod.AS]
