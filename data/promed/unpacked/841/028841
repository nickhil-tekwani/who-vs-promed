Nearly 2 dozen cases of Legionnaires' disease identified in the Coachella Valley, going back almost 6 months, prompted Riverside County health officials to advise anyone feeling symptoms to seek medical attention.

"This is a continuing investigation," county Department of Public Health Officer Dr. Geoffrey Leung said. "The department recommends that individuals who live in the identified areas who become ill with pneumonia-like, respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache, visit their healthcare provider."

According to the department, 20 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been confirmed since last fall [2021], resulting in 2 deaths connected to the illness, though one of those fatalities involved a visitor to the county. Officials said the infected patients were residents of Palm Desert, Palm Springs and neighboring communities. None of the parties were identified. The California Department of Public Health is collaborating with the county in seeking to identify potential sources.

Prior to the recent instances, there were no diagnosed cases of Legionnaires' disease within the county over the last few years, according to the Department of Public Health website. The _Legionella_ bacterium is commonly spread through aerosolized water droplets or mists, including via showers, hot tubs and air-conditioning units. It's not known to be transmitted person to person.

Those most susceptible to suffering life-threatening impacts are smokers, seniors and anyone who is immunodepressed, according to officials. The respiratory disease, and its milder variant Pontiac fever, typically develops over a 2-day to 10-day period and initially begins with headaches, muscle aches and fever of 104 degrees F [40 deg C] or higher. Additional symptoms that surface can include shortness of breath, coughing with mucus production, chest pain, gastrointestinal dysfunction, including nausea and diarrhea, and even inability to think clearly, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mayo Clinic and other sources.

Antibiotics are usually prescribed for those suffering complications. The disease was first identified in 1976, following an outbreak among attendees of an American Legion convention in Philadelphia.

[The news article above reports that a cluster of 20 cases of Legionnaires' disease has occurred over the past 6 months in the nearby towns of Palm Desert, Palm Springs, and neighboring communities in Coachella Valley in southern California, USA. A map of this area can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Coachella+Valley.

We are not told if genotyping has been done on _Legionella_ isolated from the patients. Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping.

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring of _L. pneumophila_ in water systems usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease. Pontiac fever is a non-pneumonic form of legionellosis with fever, malaise, and muscle aches that are less severe than Legionnaires' disease; symptoms of Pontiac fever resolve in 2 to 5 days without antibiotic treatment (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/clinical-features.html). Risk factors for Legionnaires' disease include age 50 years or older; smoking (current or historical); chronic lung disease (such as emphysema or COPD); immune system disorders due to disease or medication; systemic malignancy; and underlying illness such as diabetes, renal failure, or hepatic failure (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians/disease-specifics.html). Legionnaires' disease takes its name from an outbreak among people attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia in 1976.

Humans acquire Legionnaires' disease after exposure to natural or human-made aquatic reservoirs, usually by means of inhalation of aerosolized _Legionella_ bacteria, but the disease can also be acquired by aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water in people prone to aspirate, such as debilitated hospitalized patients. Possible person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease has also been described (Correia AM, Ferreira JS, Borges V, et al. Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374: 497-8; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356). _Legionella_ infection can be acquired less commonly by contamination of wounds.

More information on this cluster of Legionnaires' disease cases in southern California would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
