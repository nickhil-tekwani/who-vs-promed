[The WAHID disease time series analysis shows that between January 2005 and October 2013, 50 outbreaks of classical swine fever (CSF) were reported from Russia to the OIE: 2 in 2005, 8 in 2007, one in 2008, 3 in 2009, 14 in 2010, 12 in 2011, 7 in 2012 and one to date.

The total number of animals affected in the 50 outbreaks is: 63 012 susceptible, 2821 cases, 2039 dead, 3449 destroyed, and 928 slaughtered. Included among the affected species were: swine and wild boar (_Sus scrofa_).

This information and additional data on these outbreaks can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries.
(Note: to view the information on CSF you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, choose the region or country, and time period).

An outbreak in the European Union would trigger the slaughtering of all pigs in the infected farms and the destruction of cadavers. A protection zone (3-km radius) and surveillance zone (10-km radius) are established around each outbreak with restrictions on pig movements. An epidemiological investigation with the tracing of the source of infection and the possible spread is carried out. If appropriate, emergency vaccination can also be used. The main criteria and risk factors to be considered for the decision to apply emergency vaccination in pig holdings are listed in Annex VI of Directive 2001/89/EC.

Further details and references can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/csf_en.htm.

Amur Oblast is on the banks of the Amur and Zeya Rivers. It shares its border with the Sakha in the north, Khabarovsk and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast in the east, the Heilongjiang province of China in the south, and Zabaykal ye in the west http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amur_Oblast.

Although vaccination was not considered as a "control measure applied" or "to be applied" in this latest report, vaccination has been used previously as a control measure in prior events.

According the latest information available in WAHID, Russia reported that in 2010, 42 210 740 doses of CSF vaccine were used in swine http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Vaccination. - Mod.CRD
