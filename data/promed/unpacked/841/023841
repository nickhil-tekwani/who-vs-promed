Ducks by the dozen are dying at Lincoln Park's newly dredged North Pond
lagoon from a type of botulism that mostly affects waterfowl and may have
been activated by recent hot weather. Julie Gray, the Chicago Park
District's director of lakefront operations, said park district employees
have found and removed about 30 dead ducks in the last two weeks. Neighbors
reported removing more duck carcasses over the past month and taking a few
sick birds to veterinarians, where treatment enabled some to recover.
Gray said the deaths were caused by avian botulism, type C, a strain which
affects birds but not animals, fish or humans. "We believe the cause is the
result of the warm weather over the last couple weeks and the shallow
water" which warms quickly, Gray said.
Botulism spores lie dormant in soil and germinate when insect, fish or
animal kills provide a growth material and use up oxygen during
decomposition. Gray denied a published report that the outbreak was
triggered by pond dredging stirring up contaminated soil. "There is not a
causal relationship between this outbreak and the dredging that was done in
March," she said.
Cheri Lassila, who visits North Pond at least once a day, said she has
removed eight dead ducks from the water and disposed of them. Neighbors
have told her of removing others. She also took two ducks to be treated,
and one survived after being barely able to breathe. Federal studies have
shown that providing shade and fresh water may be enough to save birds in
the early stage of the disease, and injecting them with antitoxin can save
more than 75 percent of them. [Force feeding them with water is also
effective. - MHJ
Outbreaks of avian botulism in mostly northwest suburbs killed 60 ducks in
1991 and 1994, 30 in 1989 and more than 200 in 1985. Nationally, at least
89,000 duck deaths due to botulism were reported last year, mostly in
western states. In 1952, 4 million to 5 million birds died of avian botulism.

[With the ongoing hot weather in the north and north east we can expect
more reports of this disease. It is unfortunately normal but not part of an
emerging disaster. - MHJ
