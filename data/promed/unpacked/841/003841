Canadian customs and food inspection officers have stepped up inspection of
incoming flights from Britain to ensure no meat products infested with
Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) spark the disease in Canada.
Claude Lavigne, deputy director of animal health at the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, says Canadians who go to Britain are being asked to
avoid farms. They should wash their shoes and dry-clean their clothing if
they visited a farm - before they return. "The worst thing would be someone
coming in with homemade sausage mom made that's not cooked," he said.
"They bring it to the farm, give it to the pigs and bingo. That's how the
outbreak happened in 1952 in Saskatchewan," he said, referring to Canada's
last devastating FMD epidemic.
On top of the alert, a team of nearly 100 experts from Canada, the U.S. and
Mexico are on standby in case the disease does seep into the country.
German officials confiscated British sandwiches as possible carriers of the
disease - along with all other meat and milk products - destroying uneaten
food from passengers arriving on flights from Britain in Hamburg, Munich,
Frankfurt and at other airports.
European countries yesterday destroyed thousands of animals exported from
Britain as a precaution against the spread of the disease. "We are
especially afraid the virus can cross the (English) Channel by wind, or by
birds, seagulls," said Veronique Bellemain, chief veterinary expert at the
French agriculture ministry. "We can put controls on the Channel tunnel,
but we can't control the winds."
Thousands of farmers and their families were confined to their property as
authorities desperately tried to contain the outbreak of a virulent virus
threatening to cripple British agriculture. Farmers and veterinarians asked
for the army to help because they weren't able to keep up with the
slaughter and massive incineration of thousands of cattle, sheep and pigs.
Horse racing was cancelled by the Jockey Club. Horses can't catch the
disease, but can carry it. A rugby match between Ireland and Wales slated
for Saturday in Cardiff was postponed because authorities were worried
about 15 000 Irish fans tracking the disease back with them.
On the Continent, fear over foot-and-mouth grew as Europe extended the ban
on livestock and meat exports from Britain to 16 Mar 2001. Although the
disease has not been found anywhere in Europe, France began destroying 20
000 sheep imported before the ban went into effect.
In Holland, officials destroyed nearly 3000 sheep, deer and other livestock
that might have contacted British animals. Germany has slaughtered 2000
sheep imported from Britain and may destroy thousands more. Spain destroyed
540 imported British pigs.
Poland banned imports of livestock - including pigs, goats and sheep - from
the European Union and other European countries to protect their market,
the Polish news agency PAP reported.
