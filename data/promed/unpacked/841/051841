According to a new study, the armadillos carrying the leprosy bacteria -- called _Mycobacterium leprae_ -- that live in the southern United States have spread over the past few years and can now be found in a lot more regions.

In the paper, published [29 Oct 2015] in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases -- the researchers wrote that the 9-banded armadillos that were once found only in Louisiana and Texas actually live in other areas in southeastern United States [1]. They can transmit the _M. leprae_ bacteria to humans.

Leprosy, which is also called Hansen's disease (HD), is a chronic infection caused by the bacterium _M. leprae_. Dr David Scollard, director of the National Hansen's Disease Program Laboratory Research Branch said that ever since the 1940s, people have used antibiotics to cure Hansen's disease. Nowadays there is even more effective medication.

The infection is very rare and does not represent a public health threat, stated Richard W Truman, lead author of the study and chief of the laboratory research branch for the National Hansen's Disease Program in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

In the study, the researchers conducted tests on 645 armadillos in 4 states -- Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia -- from 2003 to 2012 and found that there were armadillos infected with _M. leprae_ in each of the locations. Evidence of the infection was found in approximately 16 percent of the armadillos, the researchers said. These areas were previously thought to be infection-free.

Truman says that the spared of Hansen's disease from armadillos to humans is very low. Only 5 percent of the population is susceptible to _M. leprae_ infection. Hansen's disease typically affects the nerves and skin and has symptoms like skin lesions, deformity, and nerve damage. Previous findings showed that 95 [percent] of people are immune to the _M. leprae_ bacteria, and even if they are exposed to it they do not get infected.

In the United States, about 150 to 250 cases of Hansen's disease are diagnosed annually, according to Truman. Another study found that 40 of the new Hansen's disease cases occur because of exposure to armadillos carrying the leprosy bacteria. These who consume [raw or improperly cooked?] armadillo's meat are more exposed to the bacteria and have an increased risk of getting the infection, Truman added.

[Serological surveys conducted prior to 2005 on more than 5000 animals confirm that _M. leprae_ infection was present among armadillos primarily in Gulf Coast states west of the Mississippi River delta (Texas, Louisiana) and Arkansas and Mississippi (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=16248207&dopt=Abstract). In addition, a unique _M. leprae_ genotype (3I-2-v1) was found both in 28 of the 33 wild armadillos and 25 of the 39 US patients who resided in areas where exposure to armadillo-borne _M. leprae_ was possible (http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1010536). This unique genotype had not been reported elsewhere in the world and the _M. leprae_ genotype of patients with foreign exposure was found to generally reflect their country of origin or travel history. These findings were previously posted by ProMED-mail (see also's below).

A small group of armadillos released from captivity in Florida gave rise to eastern populations that were all previously considered leprosy-free (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=19204343&dopt=Abstract). Apparently, western and eastern populations have now merged (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=Retrieve&list_uids=19204343&dopt=Abstract).

The abstract of the study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases Dec 2015 (see reference 1 above) that the news report above refers to follows:

"Nine-banded armadillos (_Dasypus novemcinctus_) are naturally infected with _Mycobacterium leprae_ and have been implicated in zoonotic transmission of leprosy. Early studies found this disease mainly in Texas and Louisiana, but armadillos in the southeastern United States [previously] appeared to be free of infection. We screened 645 armadillos from 8 locations in the southeastern United States not known to harbor enzootic leprosy for _M. leprae_ DNA and antibodies. We found _M. leprae_-infected armadillos at each location, and 106 (16.4 percent) animals had serologic/PCR evidence of infection. Using single-nucleotide polymorphism variable number tandem repeat genotyping/genome sequencing, we detected _M. leprae_ genotype 3I-2-v1 among 35 armadillos. 7 armadillos harbored a newly identified genotype (3I-2-v15). In comparison, 52 human patients from the same region were infected with 31 _M. leprae_ types. However, 42.3 percent (22/52) of patients were infected with 1 of the 2 _M. leprae_ genotype strains associated with armadillos. The geographic range and complexity of zoonotic leprosy is expanding."

This study (reference 1 above) found that 10 Florida patients who were infected with the strain 3I-2-v15 resided in southern Florida, the only region where armadillos with this same unique _M. leprae_ genotype strain had been found (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/12/15-0501_article#tnF3). ProMED-mail recently reported on an increased incidence of leprosy in Florida (see also's below). It would be interesting to learn if genotyping _M. leprae_ from these recent Florida patients in the ProMED-mail posts revealed the same highly specific strain of _M. leprae_ (3I-2-v15) or if they had foreign residence at any time in leprosy-endemic regions. Information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
