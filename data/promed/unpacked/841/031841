Some 100 detainees from the Dijon prison were probably the victims of food poisoning. Analyzes are under way to determine the cause of the problem. The health treatment center at the Dijon prison had to face an influx of patients on the evening of [Sat 12 Nov 2016]. All complained of stomach aches.

A dish of fish served with mayonnaise could be the cause of this poisoning which affected about 100 detainees out of approximately 260, indicates Thierry Cordelette, regional secretary of the trade union UFAP. Orders have been issued. Analyses will be carried out on the meals which have been recently served and which are prepared in the prisons' kitchens by prisoners. The aim is to clarify whether this was a food-related problem or the cause is in the preparation process.

[Dijon is a city in eastern France, capital of the Côte-d'Or department and of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region.

The symptoms of this episode of presumed foodborne illness, in addition to abdominal pain, are not stated. Knowing whether nausea and vomiting or diarrhea were the most prominent symptoms and whether fever was present would be helpful in discerning the pathogen here. Additionally, the incubation period between eating the suspected vehicle and the onset of symptoms is also important. - Mod.LL]
