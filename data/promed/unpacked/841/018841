NH anthrax patient up and walking around
----------------------------------------
Health officials say a New Hampshire woman who contracted a rare form
of anthrax 2 months ago is able to get up and walk around, but will
likely remain hospitalized for some time.

The young woman got sick a day after attending a drum circle in
Durham in December [2009]. Authorities believe she swallowed
naturally occurring anthrax spores propelled into the air by vigorous
drumming. She had been in critical condition with gastrointestinal
anthrax. Dr. Jodie Dionne-Odom, deputy state epidemiologist, says the
woman has been getting better and remains in stable condition.

Meanwhile, several companies have submitted bids to decontaminate the
United Campus Ministry building, where anthrax spores were found on 2
drums and 4 other places.
