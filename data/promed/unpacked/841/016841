More than 11 000 people in western Japan were sickened by tainted milk in
the country's biggest case of food poisoning in decades, health officials
said Thursday. Bacteria allowed to accumulate in a production-line valve
caused the outbreak, which began last week when area residents began
suffering diarrhea and vomiting after drinking lowfat milk from Japan's
largest maker of dairy products.
By Thursday morning, 11 376 people in 6 western states had gotten sick from
3 different kinds of milk produced at the plant where the germs were found,
according to the Ministry of Health. 165 people required hospitalization.
That's the largest outbreak of food poisoning in Japan since the central
government began recording such cases in 1975, said Narihiko Kawamura, an
official in the Health Ministry's Sanitation Division. It was caused by
_Staphylococcus aureus_, which can sicken people with a weakened immune
system but is usually not lethal. [Susceptibility to staphylococcal food
poisoning is not restricted to persons with compromised immune function. -
Mod.ES Officials at Snow Brand Milk Products Co. said Saturday that they
detected the bacteria at a plant in the city of Osaka that supplies lowfat
milk and other dairy products to much of western Japan. The [staphylococci
had accumulated in a production-line valve that may not have been properly
cleaned, Snow Brand President Tetsuro Ishida said at a news conference that
day.
Health inspectors in Osaka, 5 miles west of Tokyo, earlier this week
ordered the company to shut down the plant until further notice and recall
the lowfat milk and 2 other contaminated products. Police have begun
investigating the possibility of criminal negligence in the case. Ishida
will resign to take responsibility for the incident once authorities have
completed their investigation of the case and decided punitive measures for
the company, Japanese media reported Thursday. Telephone calls to Snow
Brand went unanswered Thursday afternoon. Some Japanese school cafeterias
have already stopped using Snow Brand cheese and other products not
implicated in the food poisoning case, according to local media reports.

Snow Brand President Tetsuro Ishikawa said he would resign at the end of
September to take the blame for the food poisoning outbreak that has so far
left 12 027 people sick. Nearly 30 were still in hospital.
Most of the victims of Japan's worst such outbreak in 3 decades live in the
Osaka metropolitan area, in western Japan, and became ill with diarrhea and
vomiting after drinking the low-fat milk and other products from Snow
Brand's Osaka plant.

[This thread is re-opened to report this large increase in numbers of cases
of staphylococcal food poisoning. I have extracted only 2 sentences from
the second report which covered much of the same ground as the first.
Apparently milk products not initially recalled have also been involved in
the poisonings. Now that the processing plant has been at least temporarily
shut down, and there has been more time to recall products and increase
public awareness, one can hope that the outbreak is over. - Mod.ES
