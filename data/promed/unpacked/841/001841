BURKHOLDERIA CEPACIA, ORAL ANTISEPTICS - AUSTRALIA: RECALL

Colgate-Palmolive Australia has announced a national recall, to the
consumer level, of all batches of the following products:
Colgate Periogard Clorohex Antiseptic Mouth Rinse AUST R 26774
Colgate Periogard Clorohex Antiseptic Mouth Gel AUST R 26783
Colgate Periogard Clorohex Forte Antiseptic Mouth Gel AUST R 26685
The company has been consulting with the Therapeutic Goods Administration
and has taken this action following a report of contamination of some
bottles of the mouth rinse with the bacterium _Burkholderia cepacia_ and
instances of infection in a single hospital. The TGA regards the action
taken by the company as appropriate.
This bacterium is not a likely source of infection to healthy people. The
TGA is concerned, however, that there may be an increased risk of infection
in persons with cystic fibrosis, immunosuppressed patients, and patients in
intensive care units.
The products are distributed principally through dental surgeries and
hospitals but are also available in limited numbers through pharmacies.
Consumers who have any of the above products are advised to cease using
them. Anyone who is concerned in any way about their use of these products
should consult their healthcare professional.
The TGA has put into action an investigation into the circumstances
surrounding the manufacturing of these products.

[_B. cepacia_ is a nonfermentative, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus,
formerly classified as _Pseudomonas_. Unlike _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _B.
cepacia_ is an organism of low virulence with limited ability to cause
infection in humans but, as noted in the posting, can affect certain high
risk groups.
_B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments,
where it may persist for long periods even in distilled water and in
certain antiseptic solutions, such as quaternary ammonium salts. It is
often susceptible to trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, cefepime,
meropenem, or imipenem, and has varying susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.
