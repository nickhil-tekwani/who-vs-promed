Some 200 people sickened at political gathering in Honduras
-----------------------------------------------
Some 200 people suffered food poisoning on Sun 23 Jan 2005 after dining on
chicken and rice and chop suey during a political gathering in Honduras.
The president of the country's Congress, Porfirio Lobo Sosa, sponsored the
lunch, but he and his aides escaped without getting sick. Hospital director
Hunter Torres said officials suspected food poisoning, but they weren't
sure of the exact cause.
Nearly 2000 people attended the lunch in Comayagua, 100 km (60 miles) north
of the capital, Tegucigalpa, in support of Lobo Sosa, a candidate for the
ruling National Party's presidential nomination. 2 hours after the meal,
guests began to suffer stomach cramps, nausea and vomiting, and about 150
were hospitalized.
Lobo Sosa and hospital officials said the mass case of food poisoning
didn't appear to be intentional. "We will investigate what happened, and
doctors will analyze the situation," Lobo Sosa said. "I think we will have
more information."
One of the victims, a 28-year-old, said he, his mother and his 2 brothers
were sick shortly after eating. "I felt bad, with stomach pains, and I
vomited," he said.
Torres, director of the hospital in La Paz, where many of the victims were
taken, said his facility had to turn people away, because it couldn't treat
all the victims. He added that more than half of those being treated at his
hospital were children. "We are hydrating them to make sure they don't pass
out," he said.

[Comayagua is the capital of the department of the same name in west
central Honduras.
The exact cause of the episode is not known at this point. A primarily
emetic-type illness, with what sounds like a short-incubation period (1-6
hours), is likely to be due to preformed toxins from _Staphylococcus
aureus_ or _Bacillus cereus_. Ingestion of liquids contaminated with
certain heavy metals can also cause this set of symptoms with a very short
(less than 30 minute) incubation period.
Staphylococcal food poisoning:
<http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap3.html>
---------------------------------------
The onset of symptoms in staphylococcal food poisoning is usually rapid,
and, in many cases, acute, depending on individual susceptibility to the
toxin, the amount of contaminated food eaten, the amount of toxin in the
food ingested, and the general health of the victim. The most common
symptoms are nausea, vomiting, retching, abdominal cramping, and
prostration. Some individuals may not always demonstrate all the symptoms
associated with the illness. In more severe cases, headache, muscle
cramping, and transient changes in blood pressure and pulse rate may occur.
Recovery generally takes 2 days. However, it is not unusual for complete
recovery to take 3 days and sometimes longer in severe cases.
A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce
symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when
_S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.
Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning
include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as
egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as
cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich
fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable
handling during preparation and that are kept at slightly elevated
temperatures after preparation are frequently involved in staphylococcal
food poisoning.
_B. cereus_ emetic food poisoning:
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap12.html>
---------------------------------------
The emetic type of food poisoning is characterized by nausea and vomiting
within 0.5 to 6 hours after consumption of contaminated foods.
Occasionally, abdominal cramps and/or diarrhea may also occur. Duration of
symptoms is generally less than 24 hours. The symptoms of this type of food
poisoning parallel those caused by _S. aureus_ foodborne intoxication. Some
strains of _B. subtilis_ and _B. licheniformis_ have been isolated from
lamb and chicken and incriminated in food poisoning episodes. These
organisms demonstrate the production of a highly heat-stable toxin which
may be similar to the vomiting type toxin produced by _B. cereus_.
The presence of large numbers of _B. cereus_ (greater than 6 logs of
organisms/gram) in a food is indicative of active growth and proliferation
of the organism and is consistent with a potential hazard to health. The
vomiting-type outbreaks have generally been associated with rice products;
however, other starchy foods such as potato, pasta and cheese products have
also been implicated. Food mixtures such as sauces, puddings, soups,
casseroles, pastries, and salads have frequently been incriminated in food
poisoning outbreaks.
More commonly, a diarrhea-type illness is associated with this bacterium. -
