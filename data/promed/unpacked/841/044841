A 2nd school in Palisade is getting cleaned over the weekend after several students were sick at home on Fri 15 Nov 2019, the Daily Sentinel reports.

Eight percent of Mount Garfield Middle School students were home with flu-like symptoms, District 51 spokeswoman Emily Shockley said. Some had acute-onset vomiting, which lasted between 12 and 24 hours. The health department does not know what the illness is but said it is behaving like a virus.

Palisade High School closed early Thursday [14 Nov 2019] and stayed closed Fri 15 Nov 2019 to be cleaned. 300 students and 20 percent of staff there didn't go to school. District officials are hoping to reopen Palisade High School Mon 18 Nov 2019.

The last time a school in the area was closed due to sickness was 2014, when a fast-spreading stomach virus closed Tope Elementary School in Grand Junction.

[Worldwide, norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both). About one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis, which leads to diarrhea and vomiting, is caused by norovirus (http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/worldwide.html). Norovirus is more often the cause of acute gastroenteritis among people in developed countries. In developed countries, norovirus causes about one in 5 cases of acute gastroenteritis; in developing countries, it's about one in 6 cases. Overall, developing countries have more cases of acute gastroenteritis caused by different pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. So, norovirus accounts for a smaller fraction of all cases in these countries.

With the widespread use of rotavirus vaccine, norovirus has surpassed rotavirus as the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis for which children need medical care in some countries, like the United States and Nicaragua. This trend is likely to continue as other countries routinely vaccinate against rotavirus.

Norovirus infections and outbreaks are usually more common in cooler, winter months. About half of all cases occur from December through February in countries above the equator and June through August in countries below the equator. However, in places closer to the equator, norovirus may be less seasonal. This may be because of temperature or the timing of the rainy season but may also be associated with the birth rate. - Mod.LL
