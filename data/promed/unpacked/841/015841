Government hospitals in Jeddah have been alerted following a fresh outbreak of Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever (AHF), which is named after a township located close to Makkah, where the 1st cases of Alkhurma fever were reported about 20 years ago.

During the past years, more than 40 Alkhurma cases have been reported in the kingdom. The fever hits mainly shepherds and cattle owners as well as butchers, cleaners and housewives. Pilgrims who slaughter sacrificial animals may also contract the disease.

Health Affairs in Jeddah has asked hospitals to inform it about new cases of the disease as quickly as possible, Al-Hayat Arabic newspaper reported.

Internist Dr. Sami Barood, former director general of health in Jeddah, said Alkhurma was 1st discovered among 6 patients in 1994. It is named after Alkhurma, a kind of sheep found in a township of the same name close to Taif.

Later, 11 cases were discovered in Khumra, south Jeddah, Barood said. There were new outbreaks of the hemorrhagic fever in 1999 and 2001, and 20 new cases were reported between 2001 and 2003 [see ProMED-mail archives cited below].

Barood said domesticated animals such as cats and rabbits are likely carriers and transmitters of Alkhurma virus from animals to humans. "There is no scientific proof confirming the disease being transmitted through mosquitoes," he said.

People who drink fresh milk from cows, sheep and camels without boiling may contract the disease, Barood said. Alkhurma is similar to dengue, but there are some basic differences between the 2 fevers, he added. "Dengue is transmitted through mosquitoes, while Alkhurma is transmitted through animal ticks," he said.

A person affected by Alkhurma will have fever, headache, and body pain lasting for 3-8 days.

Alkhurma fever is caused by Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV), a tick-borne virus of the Flavivirus family. The virus was initially isolated in 1995 from a patient in Saudi Arabia.

Subsequent cases of AHF have been documented in tourists in Egypt, extending the geographic range of the virus and suggesting that geographic distribution of the virus is wide and that infections due to AHFV are underreported.

"The persistence of the virus within tick populations and the role of livestock in the disease transmission process are not well understood," said the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The AHFV virus is a variant of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), a tick-borne Flavivirus found in Karnataka state and environs in India.

Since the 1st description of AHFV, several hundred cases of AHF have been reported. Cases appear to peak in spring and summer. Further study of AHFV is needed to improve public health measures.

People can become infected through a tick bites or when crushing infected ticks. Epidemiological studies indicate that contact with domestic animals or livestock may increase the risk of human infection. No human-to-human transmission of AHF has been documented, the CDC said.

Although livestock animals may provide blood meals for ticks, it is thought that they play a minor role in transmitting AHFV to humans. No transmission through non-pasteurized milk has been described, although other tick-borne flaviviruses have been transmitted to humans through this route.

Based on limited information, after an incubation period that could be as short as 2-4 days, the disease presents initially with non-specific flu-like symptoms, including fever, anorexia (loss of appetite), general malaise, diarrhea, and vomiting; a 2nd phase has appeared in some patients, and includes neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms in severe form.

Multi-organ failure precedes fatal outcomes. No repeated or chronic symptoms have been reported following recovery. Evidence suggests that a milder form may exist, where hospitalization is not required.

"Given that no treatment or specific prophylaxis is presently available, prevention and increased awareness of AHFV are the only recommended measures," the CDC said.

Complete control of ticks and interruption of the virus life cycle is impractical; in endemic regions, it is important to avoid tick-infested areas and to limit contact with livestock and domestic animals, it added.

[Although the above report does not indicate that there are current cases of Alkhurma fever, with the tick transmission season beginning in Saudi Arabia, putting hospitals and health care workers on alerts is prudent. As the above report suggests, this virus is more widely spread geographically than previously thought. The virus and human cases of encephalitis caused by it were 1st reported in Saudi Arabia in 1995. There have been several more human cases reported there since then. The virus is a flavivirus similar to another tickborne virus, Kyasanur Forest disease virus endemic in Karnataka state, India. One hopes that surveillance for Alkhurma virus encephalitis will be intensified in similar ecosystems in the Middle East, where the tick vector occurs. Interestingly, the above report discounts consumption of raw camel's milk as a major risk factor for Alkhurma virus infection compared to tick bite or contact with infected animals. This too warrants further study, given common consumption of raw camel's milk by people in this region. - Mod.TY
