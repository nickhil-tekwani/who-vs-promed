Human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China -- update
------------------------------------------------------
As of [9 Apr 2013] (14:00 CET), the National Health and Family Planning Commission notified WHO of an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus. The latest laboratory-confirmed cases include 2 patients from Jiangsu -- an 85-year-old man who became ill on [28 Mar 2013] and a 25-year-old pregnant woman who became ill on [30 Mar 2013]. Both are in severe condition. The 3rd patient is a 64-year-old man from Shanghai who became ill on [1 Apr 2013], and died on [7 Apr 2013]. To date, a total of 24 cases have been laboratory confirmed with influenza A(H7N9) virus in China, including 7 deaths, 14 severe cases, and 3 mild cases.

More than 600 close contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. In Jiangsu, investigation is ongoing into a contact of an earlier confirmed case who developed symptoms of illness. The Chinese government is actively investigating this event and has heightened disease surveillance. Retrospective testing of recently reported cases with severe respiratory infection may uncover additional cases that were previously unrecognized. An inter-government task force has been formally established, with the National Health and Family Planning Commission leading the coordination along with the Ministry of Agriculture and other key ministries. The animal health sector has intensified investigations into the possible sources and reservoirs of the virus.

WHO is in contact with national authorities and is following the event closely. The WHO-coordinated international response is also focusing on work with WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and other partners to ensure that information is available and that materials are developed for diagnosis and treatment and vaccine development. No vaccine is currently available for this subtype of the influenza virus.

Preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest that the virus is susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). At this time there is no evidence of ongoing human-to-human transmission. WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

Another person died in China from a new strain of bird flu on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013], state media said, bringing to 8 the number of deaths from the H7N9 virus since it was confirmed in humans for the 1st time last month [March 2013]. The 83-year-old victim, from the eastern province of Jiangsu, was admitted to hospital with a fever on [20 Mar 2013] and confirmed as having H7N9 on [2 Apr 2013], the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The H7N9 strain has infected 24 people, all of them in eastern China, 8 have died.

The World Health Organization has praised China for mobilizing resources nationwide to combat the strain by culling thousands of birds and monitoring hundreds of people close to those infected. Authorities have said there is no evidence of the H7N9 strain being transmitted between humans. The bird flu outbreak has caused global concern and some Chinese internet users and newspapers have questioned why it took so long for the government to announce the new cases, especially as 2 of the victims fell ill in February [2013].

Airline shares have fallen in Europe and in Hong Kong over fears that the virus could [spread to become] an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002 and killed about 10 percent of the 8000 people it infected worldwide. Chinese authorities initially tried to cover up the SARS outbreak.

In the case of the H7N9 strain, the authorities have said they needed time to identify the virus, with cases spread between eastern Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces as well as the business hub Shanghai. Other strains of bird flu, such as H5N1, have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird, and bird to human, but not generally from human to human.

Genome analysis points to poultry markets as H7N9 transmission route
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A Hong Kong professor who was among the first to crack the DNA [that is, genetic] code of the H7N9 virus suspects poultry farms are the direct transmission route of the current outbreak and it has little to do with wild birds. In order to trace the route of infection and control the virus, the next step would be to investigate poultry markets and then farms -- a difficult task that would require extensive sampling, said Malik Peiris, a flu virologist at the University of Hong Kong. It is unlikely wild birds are involved in the transmission route, as this particular H7N9 gene pattern has not been found in them so far. However, wild birds may have been part of the gene reassortment process that occurred earlier. The virus most likely originated from wild birds in Europe and Asia.

There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission at the moment, but that risk would rise if people are infected. More cases would make mutations more likely, increasing the chance it will become transmittable between humans. Finding the virus in other mammals such as pigs or dogs would also elevate that risk as the virus might have adapted to mammals, Peiris said.

Poultry markets are most likely to be the direct source of infection in these recent cases in eastern China, given previous studies he had done on bird flu. "The virus can enter one bird and stay in the market for a long time, and humans have a lot of contact with these poultry," said Peiris, a specialist in animal and human influenza viruses. Sampling work will need to be done at farms supplying the markets to find which species have been infected. He suspects mainland authorities are already working on that. H7N9 has already been found in some poultry markets in Shanghai.

The World Health Organisation's Chinese National Influenza Centre in Beijing sequenced the viral genome from each of the 1st 3 human cases -- 2 in Shanghai and the 3rd in Anhui province -- and published them in an online flu sequence database on [31 Mar 2013]. What is known is the virus' 8 genes came from 3 sources -- 2 groups of wild bird viruses and one group of H9N2 poultry virus. There are genetic characteristics which enabled the virus to bind to humans [that is, respiratory tract cells]. H9N2 has been widely spread in poultry over the past 15 years in many parts of Asia and the Middle East.

Gene reassortments are "chance events and unpredictable". It requires 2 viruses to infect one animal at the same time, which is not very common, Peiris said. "Most of the time they do not cause any problems to birds and humans." But sometimes the genetic combinations were unsuitable for the virus and it dies [that is, does not propagate], but in other circumstances the new arrangement is advantageous and the virus thrives.

The H7N9 virus has so far claimed 7 [now 8] lives and infected at least 24 people in China. In 1997, the H5N1 virus killed 6 of 18 people who contracted it in Hong Kong and led to an unprecedented mass culling of 1.4 million birds and the closure of the trade for 2 months. Scientists said that prevented a pandemic.

Chinese authorities reported 4 new H7N9 avian influenza infections in east China on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013], bringing the total to 28 cases nationwide.

A 62-year-old man in Shanghai was hospitalized with a fever on [1 Apr 2013], the Shanghai Municipal Health and Family Planning Commission said in a statement. The man was later diagnosed with pneumonia. It was confirmed that he was infected with the H7N9 virus late Monday night [8 Apr 2013], according to the commission.

Another infection in Shanghai was confirmed early Tuesday morning [9 Apr 2013], according to the statement. A 77-year-old retiree experienced fever and muscle pain on [3 Apr 2013]. He was initially diagnosed with a respiratory infection and later diagnosed with pneumonia.

Both patients are currently in stable condition and receiving medical treatment, the statement said, noting that 10 people who have had close contact with them have not shown any abnormal symptoms. As of 5 pm Tuesday [9 Apr 2013], 13 cases of H7N9 infections had been confirmed in Shanghai, including 5 cases that ended in death, the statement said.

In neighboring Zhejiang Province, 2 new cases of H7N9 avian influenza were also reported Tuesday [9 Apr 2013]. On Tuesday, H7N9 infections were confirmed in a 51-year-old woman, and a 79-year-old man, the Zhejiang provincial health department said in a statement. The woman is currently in stable condition, while the man is in critical condition, the statement said.

As of 4 pm Tuesday [9 Apr 2013], 5 cases of the infection had been reported in Zhejiang, including 2 that have resulted in death, according to the statement. 8 cases in Jiangsu Province and 2 in Anhui Province had also been reported as of 6 pm Monday [8 Apr 2013]. Of the 8 patients infected with H7N9 in Jiangsu, one died on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013], bringing the total fatalities across the country to 8.

Despite medical efforts, the patient, an 83-year-old man died in the hospital on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013] afternoon, according to a statement issued by the provincial health department. The resident of Suzhou City, went to a local hospital on [20 Mar 2013] with flu-like symptoms. On [2 Apr 2013], it was confirmed that he was infected with the H7N9 virus.

[5] Anhui, Jiangsu: fatalities (8th, 9th)
Date: Tue 9 Apr 2013
Source: The West Australian, Agence France-Presse [AFP] report [edited]

China's bird flu outbreak is "devastating" poultry sales, an industry group said Tuesday [9 Apr 2013] as the death toll from the H7N9 virus rose to 9. Since China announced over a week ago that H7N9 avian influenza had been found in humans for the 1st time, the number of people confirmed to have been infected has risen to 28.

The 2 additional patients who died Tuesday [9 Apr 2013] were from east China's Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, and had been already been confirmed with the virus, the Xinhua state news agency reported, citing health authorities. Chinese authorities say they do not know how the virus is spreading, though it is believed the infection is passing from birds to humans. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said there is no evidence H7N9 is passing from person to person -- a development that could have the potential to trigger a pandemic.

Authorities have advised the public to avoid live birds but offered reassurances that poultry and eggs that are still on sale are safe to eat if cooked properly. State media said that poultry sales had plunged in some areas of China, even regions that have so far recorded no human infections. "It's really a devastating blow to the market for broilers," Qiu Baoqin, vice secretary general of China's National Poultry Industry Association told AFP.

In the northern city of Shijiazhuang, daily chicken sales tumbled more than 50 percent from a week earlier at the city's largest agricultural market, the state-backed China News Service reported. Shanghai, where there have been 13 confirmed cases including 5 deaths, culled more than 111 000 birds, banned trading in live poultry and shut markets in a bid to curb the outbreak. Nanjing and Suzhou cities followed suit by banning live poultry sales. Hangzhou culled poultry after discovering infected quail and will vaccinate more than 60 000 carrier pigeons kept by hobbyists, state media said.

Domestic airlines have yanked chicken from the menu after complaints from passengers, the Shanghai Daily newspaper said. And fast food giant McDonald's slashed prices by more than 40 percent on a chicken item, offering 20 McNuggets for 20 yuan (USD 3.17), while emphasising in a publicity campaign that its food was safe.

China has been hit by a series of food scandals in recent years, some caused by producers deliberately using sub-standard or illegal ingredients, making the public wary over what they consume. The country was rocked by one of its biggest-ever food safety scandals in 2008, when the industrial chemical melamine was found to have been illegally added to dairy products, killing at least 6 children and making 30 000 ill.

A decade ago, China also faced accusations it covered up the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which killed about 800 people globally, but the WHO has praised Beijing's transparency for H7N9. "The authorities seem to have learned the necessary lessons from the SARS outbreak," the China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013].

As China battled the new strain, neighbouring Viet Nam on Tuesday [9 Apr 2013] reported its 1st death in more than a year from the better known H5N1 bird flu strain, which has killed more than 370 people around the world. Viet Nam's latest victim was a 4-year-old child from a farming family. Neighbouring Cambodia has also been hit with a recent unexplained spike in deaths from H5N1, with 8 so far this year [2013].

Analysts said the bird flu outbreak could hurt China's overall economy -- the world's 2nd-largest -- though the effect was expected to be temporary. "Past experiences told us that the negative impact from such epidemics won't last too long and ensuing pent-up demand could be quite strong, so there is no need for panic," China economist for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Lu Ting, said in a report.

[These reports are fragmentary and rapidly overtaken by the release of new data. As of 9 Apr 2013 the number of cases has increased to 28 with 9 fatalities. Most of the cases/fatalities are middle-aged or elderly. A mild infection has been reported in the case of one child. There is still no confirmation of human-to-human transmission of infection, and all cases are still confined to the eastern coastal region in and around Shanghai. - Mod.CP]
