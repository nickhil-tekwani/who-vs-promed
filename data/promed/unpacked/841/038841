Foremost Foods, International, Inc. of Pomona, California, is issuing
a voluntary recall on certain Tomi brand dried seafood products
because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Clostridium
botulinum_, a bacterium which can cause life-threatening illness or
death. Consumers are warned not to use the product even if it does
not look or smell spoiled. The products were manufactured by Kien
Long Seafood Company Ltd. of Viet Nam.

Botulism, a potentially fatal form of food poisoning, can cause the
following symptoms: general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and
trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing,
weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension, and constipation may
also be common symptoms. People experiencing these problems should
seek immediate medical attention.

These products were distributed in the States of California, Nevada,
and Washington through Seafood City and Manila Seafood retail stores.
This recall involves products sold between 23 Sep 2009 and 20 Oct
2010. The products are sold in a clear plastic package marked with
the specific descriptions listed below:

UPC/Description/Pack/Size
00000070187/Tomi Dried Baby Squid/40/8 oz
79598107170/Tomi Dried Golden Threadfin Beam/40/8 OZ
79598107166/Tomi Dried Indian Mackeral/40/8 OZ
79598107164/Tomi Dried Trevally/40/8 OZ
00000079922/Tomi Dried Shrimp Fry/40/4 OZ
79598107175/Tomi Dried Tuyo Herring/40/4 OZ
893509680073/Dried Anchovy (Kien Long)/40/3.5 OZ
79598107173/Tomi Dried Round Scad/40/8 OZ
79598107179/Tomi Dried Mullet Kapak/40/8 OZ

The recall was initiated after it was discovered that the
manufacturer of these products was not in compliance with US FDA food
manufacturing standards. There have been no illnesses reported to date.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts
such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases
associated with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in
these cases) are related to defective preparation procedures, which
could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable
spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL]
