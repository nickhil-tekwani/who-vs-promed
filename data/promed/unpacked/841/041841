Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Turkey
Follow-up report No. 13
Information received on 14 Apr 2006 from Dr Huseyin Sungur, Director
General, General Directorate of Protection and Control, Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Affairs, Ankara:
End of previous report period: 6 Apr 2006 (see Disease Information,
19 [15], 317, dated 13 Apr 2006).
End of this report period: 14 Apr 2006.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 15 Dec 2005.
New outbreaks: 2 villages in Kars (90 cases and deaths) and Yozgat (4
cases and deaths) provinces report outbreaks in backyard poultry
flocks. Source of new outbreaks: contact with infected animal(s) at
grazing/watering and contact with wild animals.
Between 15 Dec 2005 and 14 Apr 2006, a total of 2 503 516 poultry
within the outbreaks and around the outbreaks were culled. Between 6
and 14 Apr 2006, 20 outbreaks in 5 provinces were eradicated. For
location in eastern and central Turkey see maps at:
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/0/Kars.html> and
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/66/Yozgat.html>.
Diagnosis:
Kars Central Veterinary Control and Research Institute
RT-PCR positive for H5N1 in a goose
Yozgat Central Veterinary Control and Research Institute
RT-PCR positive for H5N1in a chicken and goose

[3] Jordan, no new cases

Avian Influenza In Jordan: Follow-up report No. 2 (final report)
Information received on 16 Apr 2006 from Dr Fares Bakhit Naser,
Director of Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Amman:
End of this report period: 13 Apr 2006.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 23 Mar 2006.
Since the last detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
subtype H5N1 in a turkey in a backyard flock at Kofranja in Ajloun
governorate, 3 weeks have now passed. Control measures have been
completed involving a stamping out policy with compensation for the
destroyed poultry in a 3-km-radius zone around the infected backyard
holding. Surveillance and control procedures have been undertaken in
the 10-km-radius surrounding zone and no more cases have been
detected. It is believed that the virus was introduced through
migratory birds. An ongoing national surveillance programme for wild
birds and domestic poultry has not detected any further infections.

[4] Sudan, backyard and commercial poultry
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_22.HTM#Sec6>

Avian Influenza In Sudan: (Highly pathogenic avian influenza has
never been reported before in Sudan).
Immediate notification report
Information received on 19 Apr 2006 from Dr Ahmed Mustafa Hassan,
Undersecretary, Federal Ministry of Animal Resources, Khartoum :
Report date: 18 Apr 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: first occurrence of a listed
disease or infection in a country.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5.
Date of start of the event: 25 Mar 2006.
Details of outbreaks: 2 outbreaks in Khartoum resulted in 27 000 and
35 000 poultry cases and deaths, respectively. A smaller outbreak in
Gezira province resulted in 1400 cases and deaths in poultry in both
closed and backyard systems.
Khartoum and Gezira States are the most highly populated States in
Sudan. Both States are situated at the centre of the country.
See map at: <http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/sudan.pdf>
As they are highly populated areas there are many poultry farms. Most
of the farms are small units with capacities ranging from 1000-50 000
birds. In addition there are 6 intensive system farms with a capacity
of around 250 000 birds. The backyard system is practiced in rural
areas all over the country. The poultry industry in urban areas in
Sudan is highly dependent on importation of hatching eggs and day-old
live poultry from various sources.
Since the start of the current reports of avian influenza in many
countries in Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Sudan has implemented
a harmonized action plan involving all stakeholders (veterinary
authorities, public health authorities and poultry producers). The
action plan is aimed at raising the capacities and capabilities to
prevent the introduction of avian influenza into the country and to
efficiently respond to the disease if introduced.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Central Veterinary
Research Laboratory
Results: rapid test positive for H5

[5] United Kingdom: wildlife, correction

Miscellaneous: Avian Influenza In The United Kingdom/Great Britain
(In Wildlife) (correction)
See Disease Information, 19 [15], 326, Dated 13 Apr 2006
Information received on 20 Apr 2006 from Dr Debby Reynolds, Director
General for Animal Health and Welfare, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), London:
On 6 Apr 2006, the United Kingdom reported a case of highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 in a wild whooper swan
found dead at Anstruther in Scotland (56 deg 13 min 29 sec N / 2 deg
40 min 55 sec W). The reference to routine use of prophylactic
vaccination in poultry was inaccurate. Vaccination is prohibited.

[Additional information in an accompanying report (not produced here
to save space) indicates that no new cases in wild birds have been
identified. It is important that this correction and clarification
was issued. Careful thought must be given to prophylactic
vaccination in poultry and certainly the report of Avain Influenza in
one wild whooper would not justify a vaccination campaign. So it is
good to see this information corrected. However, when exactly to
apply vaccine in commercial poultry is a subject we will have to deal
with unless we can limit the spread of this disease by other means --
or the natural spillover from wild birds to commercial poultry occurs
only at low levels. - Mod.PC]
