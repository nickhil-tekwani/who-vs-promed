Antimicrobial Susceptibility of _Bacillus anthracis_ Isolates
Associated with Intentional Distribution in Florida, New Jersey, New
York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., September -
October, 2001
The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of 11 _Bacillus anthracis_
isolates associated with intentional exposures on the east coast have
been determined. The susceptibility patterns of all the isolates were
similar and are described below. CDC will be issuing updated
treatment recommendations for anthrax and will disseminate them as
soon as they are completed.
Ciprofloxacin <0.06 microg/ml (susceptible)
Tetracycline = 0.06 microg/ml (susceptible)
Doxycycline <0.03 microg/ml (susceptible)
Penicillin <0.06 microg/ml - 0.12ug/ml ("susceptible" but see below)
Amoxicillin < 0.03 microg/ml ("susceptible" but see below)
Erythromycin = 1 microg/ml (intermediate)
Azithromycin =2 microg/ml (borderline susceptible)
Clarithromycin =0.25 microg/ml (susceptible)
Rifampin = 0.5 microg/ml (susceptible)
Clindamycin <0.5 microg/ml (susceptible)
Vancomycin = 1-2 microg/ml (susceptible)
Chloramphenicol = 4 microg/ml (susceptible)
Ceftriaxone = 16 -32 microg/ml (intermediate or resistant)
* The penicillin MICs were <0.06 to 0.12 microg/ml, which, using the
NCCLS staphylococcal breakpoint for penicillin, would be considered
susceptible (resistance is defined as >0.25 microg/ml).
* All of the _B. anthracis_ isolates were also susceptible to
ciprofloxacin (MIC< 0.06 microg/ml), chloramphenicol (MIC = 4
microg/ml), tetracycline (MIC=0.06 microg/ml), doxycycline (MIC=0.06
microg/ml), rifampin (MIC<0.5 microg/ml), and vancomycin (MIC 1-2
microg/ml).
* Although there are no amoxicillin breakpoints defined for
staphylococci by NCCLS, the amoxicillin results (MIC <0.03 microg/ml)
were considered susceptible for _B. anthracis_. However, the
erythromycin MICs of all 11 strains of _B. anthracis_ would be
categorized as intermediate (MIC= 1 microg/ml ). The MICs to
clarithromycin (MIC=0.25 microg/ml) and azithromycin (MIC=2 microg/ml)
are susceptible (but azithromycin MICs are at the susceptible
breakpoint). Using the NCCLS ceftriaxone breakpoints designated for
gram-negative organisms (since there are no breakpoints specifically
for ceftriaxone for staphylococci) all isolates would be considered as
intermediate (MIC =16 microg/ml) or resistant (MIC=32 microg/ml).
These MICs suggest the presence of a cephalosporinase in the isolates.
Additional studies are in progress to define the beta-lactamases of
_B. anthracis_.
Conclusions
-----------------
* The current _B. anthracis_ strains associated with the intentional
exposures are susceptible to ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, the 2
drugs approved for post-exposure prophylaxis to _B. anthracis_ and
recommended as part of initial therapy of inhalational or cutaneous
anthrax.
* The current strains also are susceptible to chloramphenicol,
clindamycin, rifampin, vancomycin, and clarithromycin, but limited or
no data exists regarding the use of these agents in the treatment or
prophylaxis of _B. anthracis_ infections.
* Cephalosporins should *not* be used for post-exposure prophylaxis or
treatment of _B. anthracis_ infections.
* The likelihood of a beta-lactamase induction event that would
increase penicillin MICs is significantly higher in infections where
high concentrations of organisms are present. Thus, treatment of known
_B. anthracis_ infections with a penicillin-type drug alone (i.e.,
penicillin G, ampicillin, etc.) in the setting where high
concentrations of organisms are present is a concern. [meaning, donÂ´t
use it. - Mod.JW
* The likelihood of a beta-lactamase induction event that would
increase penicillin MICs is lower when only small numbers of
vegetative cells are present, such as during postexposure prophylaxis.
Thus, amoxicillin or penicillin VK may be an option for postexposure
prophylaxis where ciprofloxacin or doxycycline are contraindicated.
* Additional studies are in progress to assess the susceptibility of
the penicillinase activity observed in these strains to beta-lactamase
inhibitors.
* Clinical experience is limited, but combination therapy with 2 or
more antimicrobials may be appropriate in patients with severe
infection.

anthracis_ isolated from the current intentional outbreak in the USA
are consistent with naturally occurring strains. A good review of a
