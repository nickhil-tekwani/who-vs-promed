The Washington Department of Health is working with state, local and federal public health partners to investigate the source of 6 _Salmonella_ infections. The 6 cases include residents in King, Snohomish, Thurston, Yakima and Pierce Counties. All were infected with the same strain of _Salmonella_ bacteria. The last confirmed case reported illness on 15 Sep 2018.

Five of the 6 people reported buying and eating English cucumbers from various Costco stores in Washington. The cucumbers linked to the illnesses were sold in 3-packs of individually wrapped cucumbers.

If you bought English cucumbers from Costco between 18 Aug 2018 and 10 Sep 2018 and still have them in your refrigerator, the Department of Health recommends throwing them away.

[The serotype of the outbreak organism is not stated.

Also known as greenhouse, European, or seedless cucumbers, English cucumbers (https://www.finecooking.com/ingredient/english-cucumbers) are 10 to 12 inches [25.4-30.5 cm] long and slender and are usually sold in plastic sleeves. With their thin skins, undeveloped seeds, and uniform shape, they are ideal for slicing into salads and garnishing appetizers. - Mod.LL
