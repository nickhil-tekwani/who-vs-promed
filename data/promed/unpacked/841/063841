Ibanda district authorities have banned livestock movement in 5 sub counties following an outbreak of rift valley fever. The affected include Keihangara and Kicence sub counties, Igorora town council and Bufunda division in Ibanda Municipality.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. One person from Keihangara Sub County succumbed to the fever at Mbarara regional referral hospital last month [July 2018].

Mary Bashongoka Kamaduka, the Ibanda Deputy Resident District Commissioner, says the ban on livestock movement is aimed at ensuring disease doesn't spread further. She says they are working with the Police, Veterinary department, Health department and other key stakeholders to ensure the quarantine is enforced.

Julius Bamwine, the Ibanda District Health Officer, says they are not taking the outbreak lightly, adding that they have also equipped health workers with skill to ensure the outbreak is managed effectively. He says that one person has succumbed to the disease and over 5 animals have tested positive to the disease.

The outbreak has also been confirmed in Isingiro district where 2 people are said to have succumbed to the disease. The Isingiro Resident District Commissioner, Herbert Muhangi says residents in the area have a habit of eating meat from animals that die under unclear circumstances. He says the district's top leadership has held a series of meetings to plan ahead of the situation.

[Ibanda and Isingiro districts are located in the southern part of Uganda's Western Region; see map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Uganda.

Though animal infection by RVF is known to precede human infection, unfortunately in most cases the role of its sentinels is played by human patients. This might reflect poor surveillance/reporting systems and veterinary infrastructure in the animal sector, in most RVF-endemic countries. The positive tests in "over 5 animals" in the IIbanda district, is the 1st piece of information from Uganda about the disease in animals since the start of the current event, discovered in humans in June 2018. Information on the animal species tested and the lab testing techniques applied, will be welcomed.

The previous RVF event in Uganda was reported by Uganda's ministry of health in Jan 2018, confirming 3 human cases from Kiboga, Buikwe, and Mityana districts.

The 1st report on RVF in Uganda dates back to 1936, following the detection of antibodies in humans. Uganda's 1st RVF epidemic took place in 1968; when cases were diagnosed, similarly only in humans.
