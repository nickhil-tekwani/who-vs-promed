Scientists this week confirmed the presence of a potato pest called
potato cyst nematode in an eastern Idaho field.
The cysts were discovered in soil samples collected by federal and
state agriculture officials in a 45-acre field in northern Bingham
County, south of Idaho Falls. Based on survey results, the
infestation appears to be isolated, but officials expect to conduct
additional surveillance.
The nematode is a major pest of potato crops in cool-temperature
areas. The nematode does not pose any threat to human health, but can
reduce the yield of potatoes and other crops, authorities said. There
is no sign that the quality of tubers grown in Idaho has been
affected, the Idaho Agriculture Department said.

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is susceptible to the
potato cyst nematode (PCN). PCN is found in many places where
potatoes are grown, including Europe. The white or pale PCN
(_Globodera pallida_) was reported for the 1st time in Idaho 21 Apr
2006 ( 20060423.1195). Prior to that report _G. pallida_ was only
known in Newfoundland, Canada in North America (see link for
worldwide distribution map). This report provides details about the
location of the infested site which is a field in northern Bingham
County, south of Idaho Falls. The detection of cysts in soil samples
from the field, rather than on harvested potatoes, is also new
information. Idaho agencies sample heavily each year for the
nematode pathogen but this positive test will probably result in even
more intense soil sampling to determine if this is truly an isolated
single infested field.
