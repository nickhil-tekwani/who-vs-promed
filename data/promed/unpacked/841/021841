Sixteen people have died of Rift Valley fever in Baringo, Maragua and Taita
Taveta districts. Eleven died in Marigat, Baringo District, while 5 others
died in Taita, Taveta and Maragua districts, veterinary officers said on
Fri 2 Feb 2007. This brings the death toll from the disease to 150 since
the 1st case was reported in North-Eastern Province in January 2007.
Panic gripped Baringo residents as more people succumbed to the disease and
several patients were admitted to hospital. Veterinary officers have
imposed quarantine and ordered all butcheries closed after 2 more people
died on Thursday night. Villagers said 11 people had died even as
veterinary officers insisted it was 6.
An estimated 300 goats and sheep have died of a mysterious disease linked
to the spread of [Rift Valley fever] in the past week.
The clinical officer in charge of Marigat Sub-district Hospital, Rahab
Randall, said 4 people have died in the last week. "We have confirmed 4
deaths arising from the disease after samples we sent to the Kenya Medical
Research Institute (KEMRI) tested positive," said Randall. Randall said a
Standard Five pupil died while undergoing treatment at the Moi Teaching and
Referral Hospital while a middle-aged woman died at home.
Ngambo location chief, Mr Joseph Lenasheku, said many people were unable to
reach hospital due to heavy rains that rendered roads impassable. The body
of a 32-year-old woman, who died after feasting on meat from a dead sheep,
could not be taken to the mortuary due to the bad state of the roads.
In Nakuru, butcheries continued to suffer losses as residents avoided meat
fearing to contract Rift Valley fever. The manager of Gilanis Butchery, Mr
S A Haji said sales have since gone down. However, he assured his customers
that the meat was inspected and stamped by certified Government officers.
Mr Samson Keitany, a supervisor with Hygienic Butchery, said business had
been bad in the last 2 weeks. Keitany said he reduced his order to one cow
a week from 3. Gladys Njeri of Village Park Butchery said she reduced her
orders to 2 goats per day from 5. Butchers urged the Government to step up
vaccination and public awareness campaigns.
In Taita Taveta, 2 more people have succumbed to the disease. Two other
people are fighting for their lives at Taveta District Hospital. Those who
died included a Maasai herdsman and a woman at Salaita village in Taveta
division. Last month a Somali herdsman died at Kuranze Ranch in Voi
division. The Taita Taveta District medical officer of health, Dr Shem
Patta, said the victims died of a disease with symptoms similar to Rift
Valley fever. Dr Patta said one of those who died was treated in Tanzania
but died on return. The MOH said goats and cows were reportedly dying of an
unidentified disease. Patta said samples had been taken to KEMRI for
analysis. He said unrestricted movement in Taita could fan the rapid spread
of the disease. "We have set up an isolation ward in all public health
facilities, equipped workers with protective gear, and notified them of the
latest outbreak," said Dr Patta. He said the Government is educating the
public on the disease.
The District veterinary officer, Dr Julius Nkanata, said several animals
have died of an unidentified disease in the area. Samples have been taken
to Nairobi for tests.
In Maragua 3 more cases of the deadly fever have been reported. The Senior
Deputy Director of Medical Services, Mr Shanaz Sharif, said the samples
taken to KEMRI tested positive while those taken to Kirinyaga District
Hospital tested negative.

[Despite the more optimistic assessments of international agencies (see:
Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (11): Kenya, Somalia 20070131.0398, and
Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (12): Kenya 20070201.0413) local opinion
is that the outbreak is still spreading.
