As many as 100 cattle have died due to a foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak in Barchhain and Ghangal VDCs of Doti in the past one month [A VDC is a village development committee, the lower administrative unit in developing rural Nepal].

The outbreak has now spread to Lanakedareshwor, Mannakapadi, Pashchimka, Bajhakakani, Kalikasthan, Dahakalika, Mudbhara, and Tijali VDCs and Dipayal Silgadhi Municipality, sources at the District Livestock Office said.

"The disease, which has hit pregnant cattle the most, is spreading rapidly through the easy medium of air and water," said DLO Chief Dikardev Bhatta, adding that a team of technicians have been deployed to the affected areas.

"I lost 10 goats to the disease," said Padhamsingh Badaila of Barchhain-1.

According to technicians, the cattle suffering from FMD develop sores in their mouths and hooves and find it hard to eat fodder. The disease is easily transmitted within the radius of 60 km.

FMD is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic and wild bovids. The virus causes a high fever for 2 or 3 days followed by blisters inside the mouth and on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.

[While this event may appear alarming, it is not clear at present whether the mortality rate is unusual for Nepal. The last submitted 6-monthly report from Nepal is the semi-annual report covering January-June 2013. In this report, Nepal indicated they had 24 outbreaks of FMD, with a total of 5903 cases and 104 deaths. The pathogenicity of the virus strain in cattle, buffaloes and goats (the main affected species) were as follows: cattle (3722 head, 31 deaths), buffaloes (1308, 11) and goats (823, 42), namely case fatality rates (percentages) of 0.83, 0.84, and 5.1 respectively. The report can be accessed at http://tinyurl.com/lx9bvwa. It will be interesting to obtain the case fatality rates of the described outbreak in the Far-Western region.

FMD serotype O is endemic in Nepal, therefore, no immediate notifications on new outbreaks are required; the current FMD outbreak is expected to be recorded in the 6-monthly report covering January-June 2014.

Immediate notifications are required if a new strain/pathogen appears for the 1st time or when there is evidence of a change in the epidemiology of the disease (including host range and pathogenicity).

Nepal's FMD history is available in the country's page of WRLFMD, at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/nep.htm. According to the information there, the FMDV serotype O, which has circulated in Nepal since 2010, is topotype "ME-SA," lineage "Ind-2001d." The most recent genotyping report was published on 3 Mar 2014 (batch WRLFMD/2014/00003). It covers a total of 23 isolates (7, 8, and 8 isolates for the years 2012, 2013, 2014, respectively), available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2014/WRLFMD-2014-00003%20O%20Nepal%202012-2014.pdf.

According to the said report, the most closely related reference strain was found to be "O/BHU/3/2009" (topotype ME-SA, lineage Ind-2001d). Subscribers are reminded that a very close virus strain has reached Saudi Arabia and Libya and is currently circulating in Tunisia.

Official confirmation and serotyping results of the current strain will be helpful. - Mods.CRD/AS
