Tests have indicated there were no bacterial or viral infections
associated with a massive die-off of rainbow smelt in Lake Erie that
covered the shoreline from Point Pelee to south of Simcoe with
hundreds of thousands of dead fish.

"The lab results didn't really tell us anything we didn't already
know," Andy Cook, assessment biologist for the Ministry of Natural
Resources, said Tuesday [8 Jun 2010].

A combination of stormy weather during spawning, fish overpopulation
and lower body weight [of the fish] are primary causes that lead to
massive piles of dead fish floating on shorelines in late May 2010
throughout the lake, including the U.S. side in Ohio and New York.

Tests were conducted on samples of about 20 live and dead smelt. One
fish showed signs of a fungus, Cook said. "The role of the fungus is
not clear in this mortality because others lacked any signs of the
fungus," he said. "Our story has not really changed; environmental
conditions at the time of spawning caused a lot of stress on the fish
at that time. Low body weight also contributed."

Cook could only guess at the final tally of dead smelt being in the
hundreds of thousands. It is not the largest ever, with bigger
die-offs in the 1950s and 1960s, but Cook called it the largest in the
last 20 years. "There was another in 2005 and one in the mid-1990s,
but they were not as high in magnitude," he said. "The fact there were
no bacterial or viral causes with this is a cause for relief."

Property owners have been left to clean up the dead fish, meaning no
government cleanup costs.
