Health authorities of the metropolitan area of Cucuta [in the eastern
province of Norte de Santander yesterday declared a health alert after the
number of new cholera cases rose to 60. In addition, alerts were
established by Venezuelan health authorities in the states of Zulia,
Tachira, and Merida owing to the heavy border traffic between the two
countries. The state of Zulia itself has more than 700 Km of border with
Colombia.
According to the Venezuelan Ministry of Health, the state of
Zulia has reported the most cases (700 with 16 deaths), followed by the
Federal District, Miranda, Carabobo, Cojedes, Aragua, Monagas, Delta
amacuro, and Merida.
The most recent 9 cases in Colombia were detected between Saturday and
Sunday in the sector of Bocono, 5 Km from La Parada in the metropolitan
area of Villa del Rosario. Aide Soto, Chief of Basic Health Care of Villa
del Rosario, reported that it is not known if the 9 new cases had any
contact with any patient of La Parada.
The new outbreak became evident last Thursday with the death of an 11 year
old girl from the neighborhood of El Centro, and the identification of 20
persons six months after the epidemic was thought to have been controlled
in this area of the country. Authorities fear that the epidemic has broken
out of the control area in La Parada. Despite efforts to control the
advance of cholera, the medications to treat the disease are becoming
scarce. This Monday the Municipal Administration of Villa del Rosario is
requesting from the national government more medicines and principally more
intravenous fluids.
According to Venezuelan sources, the new outbreak was located in the area
La Parada on the border with [the Venezuelan state of Tachira where it has
been established that the inhabitants drink well water that originates
in the Tachira River, and it has been verified as well that environmental
health conditions are precarious, particularly with respect to sewage
treatment. [The ambiguity of this sentence was present in the original
Spanish - DMC
[The articles confirm reports of cholera in eastern Colombia during the
last few months. The location is near the Pan American Highway that leads
to and from the Venezuelan state of Tachira from which recent cases of
cholera in travelers from Colombia have been reported - trans. Dave Coder,
