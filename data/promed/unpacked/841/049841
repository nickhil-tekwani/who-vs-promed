In Himachal Pradesh 2 people have died of scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bite of an infected mite, an official said on Tuesday [4 Sep 2012]. With these deaths, the [death] toll in the state due to the disease increased to 3 this year [2012].

KS Rana, edictal superintendent of Shimla's Indira Gandhi Medical Collage and Hospital, said: "2 people died in the past 2 days and 30 people have tested positive for the disease." He said one of the victims belonged to Chopal area in the interior of Shimla district, while another belonged to Hamirpur town. Shimla, Mandi, Solan, and Sirmaur are the worst scrub typhus-affected districts.

In the last 3 years, more than 60 people have died of it in the state, health officials said.

Its symptoms are fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastroenteritis -- inflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines.

[The following is excerpted from: Demma LJ, McQuiston JH, Nicholson WL, et al: Scrub typhus, Republic of Palau. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12 (2): 290-5. Available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf):

"Scrub typhus is a zoonotic illness caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_. The pathogen is transmitted through the bite of larval mites (chiggers) of the _Trombiculidae_ family, which serve as both the vector and the reservoir (1,2). Rodents of the family _Muridae_ (rats and mice) are common hosts for trombiculid mites and may support _O. tsutsugamushi_. Geographically specific foci of scrub typhus are thus determined by the distribution of vector mites and their rodent hosts and by interactions of mites and rodents with humans (3). Scrub typhus has been reported from many regions of Asia and the Pacific islands, and known disease-endemic regions extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan (4,5).

"Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness; its severity may be influenced by the strain of _O. tsutsugamushi_, a person's immune status, and other factors. Diagnosis may be complicated in areas where the disease has not been documented recently or in regions lacking the capacity for laboratory confirmation. Illness develops after an incubation period of 6 to 21 days and usually begins with an eschar at the site of a chigger bite. Fever, headache, [lymphadenopathy], and myalgias are common, and a maculopapular rash may also be present. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or lower respiratory symptoms can also occur. Manifestations such as pneumonitis, meningoencephalitis, jaundice, renal failure, and myocarditis can develop during the prolonged clinical course of untreated illness (6). Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (5). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no12/03-0212.htm). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation.

Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage.

Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state in northwestern India with an elevation ranging from about 350 meters (1148 ft) to 7000 meters (22 966 ft) above sea level and has one of the highest per capita incomes of any state in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh).
