Foot and mouth disease, Korea (Rep. of): Follow-up report No 1

Epidemiological comments

The outbreak of foot and mouth disease reported on 7 Jan 2010 was
found to be caused by the type A strain of foot and mouth disease
virus using antigen detection ELISA and nucleotide sequencing of
complete VP1 protein coding region. This sequence data was sent to the
OIE Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease for constructing
the phylogenetic tree.

All cloven hoofed animals (a total of 324 cattle, goats or deer)
raised in the area within a 500-meter radius of the affected farm were
culled and buried. Farms which bought calves from the affected farm
were investigated. Among them, 2 farms were found that bought calves
from the affected farm within 7 days prior to the date of the
outbreak. They are not located in this control zone (an area within a
20-km radius of the affected farm), and all dairy cows in these farms
were found to be negative to FMD tests. But as a preemptive measure,
all these cows were culled.

Three farms which were found to have purchased cattle from the
affected farm between 7 and 21 days prior to the date of the outbreak
were put under movement restrictions, and tests are ongoing.

[On 22 Jan 2009, China sent the OIE an Immediate notification on an
outbreak in dairy cattle in Hubei, caused by "A new strain of a listed
disease," namely FMDV serotype A. Out of the 294 susceptible animals,
58 were reportedly clinically affected; 5 died, the remaining 289 were
culled. A month later, the outbreak was declared as "resolved."

On 25 Jan 2009, a sample from the said outbreak was received at
WRLFMD, Pirbright. The virus was topotyped Asia; the report is
available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-0000A-China-A.pdf>.
Later, the virus was identified in eastern China as well (Shanhai).
Commentary on the reporting history of this virus, which seems to have
spread throughout vast areas of China, can be found in ProMED post
20090223.0757. The current situation can be deduced from the following
commentary, included in the report of the 5th Annual Meeting of the
Network of OIE/FAO Reference Laboratories for FMD in Delhi (see ProMED
post 20100109.0099): "For 2010, the main concern in China is over
possible continuation of outbreaks caused by serotype A."

Results of the genotyping of the S. Korean strain at Pirbright, and
its comparison to the Chinese strain, are awaited.

It will also be interesting to note if the A China F/72 vaccine
strain, applied in the Chinese vaccines, confers satisfactory
protection against the current S. Korean FMDV-A strain. - Mod.AS]
