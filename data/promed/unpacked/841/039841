On 25 Jun 2008, a general practitioner in Pouilly [France] reported to
the Interregional Epidemiology Unit, East Central, 3 cases of measles
(IgM positive) in a private Catholic girls school in the Cote d'Or at
Pouilly-en-Auxois [France]. The index case, a Swiss resident, became
ill on 28 Apr 2008 (with onset of rash on 3 May 2008). In mid-April
2008, the patient (when herself sick) had visited cousins in Feldkirch
in Austria during a raging epidemic of measles.

On 25 Jun 2008 also, a general practitioner in the Pas de Calais
[France] reported the occurrence of a suspected case of measles in one
of his patients, a school student aged 14 from a religious school for
girls in the town of Camblain l'Abbe [France], accommodating pupils
from many parts of France and from foreign countries (Britain,
Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg). This case, from Cote d'Or, is the
brother of 3 young girls in the junior school at Pouilly-en-Auxois,
who had themselves had measles (onset of rash on 6, 7 and 15 Jun 2008).

In the wake of these alerts, a retrospective and prospective survey
was conducted.

Preliminary results
-------------------
Cases which occurred in the school at Pouilly-en-Auxois:

43 cases were recorded in this establishment, where there were 147
young girls aged between 6 and 18, giving an attack rate of 29
percent. The cases occurred between 3 May and 16 Jul 2008 (the dates
of appearance of a rash). The average age of the pupils was 12 years,
but pupils of all ages were affected. Five cases were biologically
confirmed (PCR/IgM) and genotyped as D5 in 2 cases. 91 percent of the
cases had not been vaccinated. Among the 20 adults working at the
school, one, an unvaccinated 30-year-old nun, exhibited a rash on 30
May 2008. Measles virus infection was not confirmed biologically.

Cases recorded at Camblain l'Abbe:

9 cases were recorded among 154 boys aged between 8 and 17, an
attack rate of 6 percent; 3 of the 9 cases resided in the United
Kingdom at Dover. No biological confirmation has been obtained for
these cases. One case resides in Canada and was biologically
confirmed (genotype unknown). No information is available for the
other pupils. 4 cases from Belgium were confirmed biologically and
the index case was infected by a D5 genome virus. The other 5 cases
were confirmed epidemiologically. From 87 individual questionnaires
received so far, 62 percent had received one dose of vaccine, and 45
percent 2 doses. None identified so far were unvaccinated.

Community Cases:

A total of 56 secondary cases occurred between 26 May 2008 and 19 Jul
2008. 54 were from the same community, with an average age of 9 years
(9 months to 21 years). One case was observed among their parents (a
36-year-old father). Another 29-year-old adult with no connection to
the 2 establishments contracted infection at a doctor's clinic in
Camblain L'Abbe, where the index case from the school had been
examined. 2 of the community cases have been confirmed biologically
and the remainder epidemiologically. One person was admitted to
hospital. Among these 56 cases, 52 (96 percent) were unvaccinated.

[The text of the original document contains a figure showing the
distribution of cases at the 2 religious establishments by week
according to the time of onset of a rash when the data is available
(104 cases).]

Conclusion
-----------
In total, 109 cases were recorded in the measles outbreaks involving
2 religious educational establishments in Cote d'Or: 1st,
Pouilly-en-Auxois and then Camblain l'Abbe. However, only 8 obligatory
declarations have been lodged with the National Public Health
Institute so far, because the epidemic occurred between 25 Jun 2008
and the end of the school year, which has complicated the collection
of information. Not all cases were seen by a doctor, an important
factor in situations in which there are large families and poor
vaccine coverage. Reference of samples to the National Reference
Centre established that the virus responsible for the outbreaks
belonged to the D5 genotype prevalent at this time in Switzerland.

[One must wonder whether this outbreak will have spread further
beyond France with the dispersion of pupils to other countries at the
end of the school year.
