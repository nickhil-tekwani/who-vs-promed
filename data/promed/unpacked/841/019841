The bird flu virus has spread within Sungai Apit district in Siak
regency, Riau, following the death of a child infected with the virus
at the end of March 2009, says a local official, adding prevention
measures were being hampered by residents' reluctance to cull their
poultry.

District chief Indra Atmaja said the spread of the virus was only
discovered following reports of poultry dying abruptly on 4 Apr 2009.

"After checking by a team of veterinarians, 2 of the chickens tested
positive for bird flu. A day earlier, we received reports that 12
chickens owned by other residents had died suddenly," Indra told The
Jakarta Post by phone on Wednesday [8 Apr 2009].

He added the virus had spread to Teluk Masjid and Teluk Batil
villages and Sungai Apit subdistrict.

"Seven chickens died suddenly the previous day in Sungai Apit
subdistrict, while in Teluk Masjid and Teluk Batil, the number has
reached 29," he said. "Based on field tests conducted by the Siak
Animal Husbandry Agency, the chickens tested positive for bird flu."

Indra said the test results had been publicized through village
chiefs and neighborhood unit chiefs to raise residents' awareness of
the risk of infection.

The team from the Siak Animal Husbandry Agency has sprayed residents'
poultry cages with disinfectant to prevent the virus from spreading
further.

Indra also urged residents to cull their poultry. However, he said
only few residents were willing, while most would only do so if paid
to.

"It's not that we don't want to, but the district office has no such
budget for the purpose. For now, we can only remind the residents,
including through sermons at mosques, of the risks of bird flu. We
cannot force the residents to cull their poultry if they don't want
to," he said.

[Farmers are indeed not expected to cull clinically-unaffected,
suspected-to-be-exposed or in-contact birds without compensation. If
such budget remains absent, mass vaccination remains the only way in
an HPAI-endemic situation, ideally conferring constant coverage to
the entire target population (susceptible domestic avians) including
prescribed revaccinations in a timely manner.

HPAI infection is considered to be established throughout most of
Indonesia, although incidence varies widely. Only 2 of its 33
provinces have not experienced the occurrence of H5N1. The events
described in the current report are in Sumatra, where the disease is
regarded endemic, similar to the other big Indonesian island
territories Java and Sulawesi, while sporadic outbreaks are reported
from other areas. The high number of reported outbreaks monthly for
Indonesia can be explained by the implementation of the
"participatory disease surveillance and response" (PDSR) 1 programme
that targets village-type poultry production systems (both backyard
and small-scale intensive) and has been very effective at detecting
evidence of virus circulation in the village environment. The
programme is supported by FAO, thanks to USAID financial support (see
FAO report, item 2 in 20090326.1178).

Indonesia submitted to the OIE its immediate notification on HPAI
H5N1 on 25 Sep 2006. On 26 Sep 2006, it notified the OIE that the
disease was regarded endemic. No additional follow-up reports have
been submitted since. The number of outbreaks and their locations are
included in the 6-monthly and annual reports.

According to the information available in WAHID's table "Detailed
country(ies) disease incidence: number of new outbreaks reported,"
the disease was present in Indonesia during 2005, but no number of
outbreaks is given. To view the numbers for the period January
2006-June 2008 for each of Indonesia's administrative regions, go to
