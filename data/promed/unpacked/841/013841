The Marine Mammal Center in the Marin Headlands reported last week that 63
California sea lions suffering from a mysterious malady causing seizures,
disorientation and vomiting have been brought into the center over the past
two weeks off beaches from San Luis Obispo to Santa Cruz. Of those, 25 have
died.
Shelbi Stoudt, stranding coordinator at the center's satellite office in
Moss Landing on Monterey Bay, was quoted as saying, "They're kind of
flopping around in the surf, waving their head around and acting like they
can't see. It's making it hazardous to the public. The animals can rear up
and attempt to bite an individual who is trying to help them."
The cause of what experts think is some kind of nervous system disorder is
unknown. Experts say it could be a natural toxin, a virus or a man-made
contaminant. Tissue and blood are being analyzed.
The Department of Health Services recently issued an advisory warning
consumers not to harvest mussels because of a toxic marine organism, said
Joe Cordaro, a coordinator of the state's marine mammal stranding network
at the National Marine Fisheries Service. But he said a connection between
the contaminated shellfish and the sick sea lions is speculative, because
the afflicted animals did not seem hungry enough to feed on shellfish,
which are not their typical food source.

[This appears to be in the same general area as that applied to the 2-week
oyster harvesting stoppage. As soon as a diagnosis is known for these sea
lions, may we ask that it be shared with us. - Mod.MHJ
