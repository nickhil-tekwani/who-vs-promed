After saying the deaths of countless fish in Irondequoit Bay this spring [2013] were due to a natural seasonal phenomenon, New York environmental officials reversed course Tuesday [28 May 2013] and said that an infectious fish disease is to blame.

The disease, known as viral hemorrhagic septicemia or VHS, does not pose a threat to humans or other mammals, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). But it has killed a large number of gizzard shad, white perch, yellow perch, and drum in the bay, the DEC stated. No mortality numbers were released, but from witness accounts, the number is in the thousands.

Walter Burack of Rochester was kayaking in Ellison Creek near Empire Boulevard in early May [2013] and saw what he termed a "massive" die-off. "These fish were behaving incredibly bizarrely. Honestly, the number of dead fish and their odd circular swimming at the surface was so striking that I told my son at the time that this might be 'fish plague,'" he said.

The die-off began in late April [2013], according to the DEC and to residents along Irondequoit Bay and along Ellison Creek, which feeds the bay from the south.

The DEC asked anglers to avoid spreading VHS to other bodies of water by not taking fish, including bait, from the bay to other bodies of water; by cleaning the hull, motor, propeller, trailer and other gear of any boat before leaving the bay; and by disinfecting the live well, bilge and bait tanks with a 10 per cent solution of bleach.

VHS was 1st documented in the Great Lakes when it caused a large die-off in Lake Ontario in 2005. Since then, it has been blamed for mass deaths of fish in a number of Finger and Great lakes, according to the DEC.

The virus cannot make humans sick, but it does affect many different species of fish.

When the DEC was asked about the die-off in early March 2013, the agency said it was due to spring water-temperature changes and other environmental stresses.

[VHS is an acute to chronic disease of salmonids caused by a Rhabdovirus. This virus is one of the most studied fish pathogens and has expanded its geographic range and habitat occupation in the last 2 decades. The disease was 1st recognized in Germany in 1938. The 1st detections of VHS in North America were in Washington State from adult coho (_Oncorhynchus kisutch_) and chinook (_O. tshawytscha_) salmon in 1988.

Although the virus is widespread and ubiquitous at low prevalence and intensity, disease epidemics periodically occur in free-ranging and confined fish. The temperature of the water appears to be implicated in the variability in susceptibility to this virus (J Exp Marin Biol Ecol 444 (2013): 81-86). - Mod.PMB
