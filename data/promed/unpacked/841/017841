At a recent symposium, comprising some of the country's top ecologists and
veterinarians, organised jointly by the South African National Parks, the
Mpumalanga Directorate of Veterinary Services and the Mpumalanga Parks
Board. Scientists from the Kruger Park noted that although many buffalo die
of the disease it was not yet killing off massive numbers of these animals.
But other species, especially lion, appear to be suffering more heavily in
the short term. A number of recent cases have been established of lions
dying from TB in both Kruger and Hluhluwe whereas it is possible buffalo can
carry the disease with them for life.
It is possible that lions are being badly affected as in Kruger many
of the [big cats have FIV [feline immunodeficiency virus while
those in Hluhluwe have compromised immune systems because of heavy
inbreeding.
Dewalt Keet, senior veterinarian in the Kruger Park's Directorate of Animal
Health at Skukuza, says the park management will spend the next 12 months
conducting intensive research to establish more precisely what impact the
disease is having on the mortality of various species in the park. Kruger
authorities will then consider shooting out the most heavily infected herds.
The Mpumalanga Parks Board is preparing to either eliminate the entire
herd of 350 to 400 buffalo in its Mthethomusha Game Reserve that abuts on
the south-western border of Kruger or to shoot the most heavily infected herds.
Both the Kruger and Mpumalanga park authorities have set up sterilised bomas
[corrals where they will place pregnant buffalo cows in quarantine-like
conditions so that they can breed a reservoir of TB-free buffalo to
repopulate areas where heavy culling might have to occur. The consequences
of the epidemic are potentially critical for conservation and the protection
of biodiversity in South Africa. Other game reserves are indicating a
reluctance to purchase wild-caught game from Kruger and Hluhluwe, fearing
they may be contaminated. This is likely to cause revenue problems for
reserves that rely on sale of wild game to bolster their conservation work.
Plans to create large transfrontier conservation areas, popularly known as
peace parks, between South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe are in jeopardy
as neighbouring states are reluctant to drop their game fences and run the
risk of their animals becoming infected. "Practically, tuberculosis may move
across the borders of infected premises in either direction, and infected
animals on either side may thus remain a persistent source of infection that
will serve to maintain the infection and serve as sources of re-infection,"
says Kriek. There are also fears that, although cattle from ranches abutting
Kruger's southern borders first introduced the disease to buffalo, now there
is a reverse danger of buffalo and other smaller species re-infecting
domestic livestock.
More serious is the fact that humans can contract TB from the bovine strain.
Residents of villages living on the borders of the parks are particularly at
risk because many of them poach illegally for subsistence purposes and can
contract the disease from undercooked meat of infected animals. By extension
it was even possible that visitors to game parks who eat contaminated meat
might contract this form of tuberculosis.
Scientists at the symposium acknowledged that drastic action was now
required to contain the epidemic of the late 1990s but admitted that they
were hamstrung by a lack of knowledge about the disease and how to cure it
in animals, especially as there is no effective vaccine for animals. In
addition, there is no reliable ante-mortem diagnostic way of testing live
animals for possible infection except in the case of buffaloes. This
prevents veterinarians in the park from establishing infection rates in most
species except when carcasses are obtained for post-mortems.
A serious consequence is that most animals for trans-location cannot be
tested, raising the prospect of spreading the disease from one reserve to
another.
Prevalence in Kuger's herds range from
five percent to 90 percent with herds south of the Sabi River being most
heavily affected. The prevalence rate declines northwards and veterinarians
in the park believe the disease has reached to somewhere between the
Olifants and Luvuvhu Rivers. There is also concern that smaller species
might contract, host, and spread the TB bacteria.
Scientific research conducted at the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute,
primarily by Anita Michel, indicates that there are 17 strain of bovine
tuberculosis in the Kruger Park. Tests indicate that the bacteria can
survive in the environment in faeces, contaminated flesh, or even in sputum
left on leaves and other debris for up to eight weeks in winter and four
weeks in summer.
