A 47-year-old man ill of [a] hantavirus [infection] died in La Plata city, the Buenos Aires Ministry of Health confirmed.

The victim, whose identity was not given, lived in La Plata and worked in a lottery agency in the Bartolome Bravo locality, Magdelena community, so that health authorities in both communities have adopted rodent control measures in areas where the man had traveled.

According to the statement from the Buenos Aires Ministry of Health, the man began to feel ill on 1 Jun [2015] and immediately went to a physician who was unable to [accurately] diagnose his clinical situation. Finally, his situation became worse and so was admitted to the Italiano Hospital in La Plata where he died on 5 Jun [2015]

The provincial health office stated that with the suspicion that they were dealing with a case of [a] hantavirus [infection], samples were taken and sent to the Instituto Malbran [reference laboratory] that finally confirmed the disease.

This disease [virus] is contracted through contact with urine and fecal matter of carrier rodents and causes muscle pain, fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, vomiting and coughing.

[There were several cases of hantavirus infection in Buenos Aires province during 2014, 3 of which have been fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). There was also a case there this year (2015) as well [see ProMED archive listed below]. Public education is essential to prevent rodent populations of rodents, the reservoir hosts of the virus, from becoming established in houses and other buildings. The hantaviruses involved in the above report and in the previous cases are not identified, and ProMED would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus has been laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infection have been reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in these 2014 Buenos Aires province cases. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but these cases in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, the Lechiguana virus rodent reservoir, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
