Heavy rains have again hit northern Viet Nam following the worst floods to
hit the region in over 35 years. At least 82 people have been killed since
unseasonal rains started in north-central Viet Nam and the capital Hanoi
late last month [Oct 2008].

Teams using heavy earth moving equipment are reinforcing a Red River dyke
near the city with 12 000 cubic metres of boulders and rocks after more
than 800 millimetres of rain pounded Hanoi in 5 days. The Red River and its
tributaries burst their banks, inundating rice fields and more than 120 000
buildings, including much of Hanoi.

Many residents complain of receiving little help from emergency workers or
soldiers as their neighborhoods disappeared under a metre of brown
floodwater, trapping thousands of people in their houses. Authorities in
the capital say they are trying to contain the spread of dengue fever after
180 cases of the mosquitoborne disease were reported by Hanoi hospitals in
a 6 day period.

[This news is worrisome, as the number of dengue cases is likely to rise as
people store drinking water, thus providing more breeding sites for the
dengue virus vector mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_.

Within 48 hours, 154 fresh cases of dengue fever have been confirmed in the
government hospitals here on Thursday [6 Nov 2008].

Punjab Health Department said that, following the new dengue cases coming
to the fore in the city, the number of dengue patients has shot up to 292,
while in Punjab, [dengue cases have] soared to 437.

In the backdrop of fast rising dengue cases, the Punjab chief minister has
asked for a report from the health department, while doctors have advised
citizens to take preventive measures from dengue [virus infection].

CM Punjab has also formed a 3-member committee to stop the alarming
increase of the cases, the health department said.

An Australian medical research institute says dengue fever in the South
Pacific has reached a pandemic level. According to the Institute of Medical
Research at the Royal Brisbane Hospital, the Pacific is in the grip of a
dengue fever pandemic.

Samoa, Tonga, Kiribati, New Caledonia, and Palau have reported high levels
of the fever. In Fiji, there are about 2000 people infected from a
population of just over 900 000. The director of the institute, Professor
Brian Kay, says the new strain of the fever [virus] is not responding to
old vaccines.

"There probably will not be a vaccine ready until, I would think, 2015
would be the latest," he said. Professor Kay says the new strain of dengue
[virus] is coming from mosquitoes bred in man-made environments like water
storage tanks.

[Brian Kay was undoubtedly misquoted in this article when he reportedly
said that a new strain of the virus is not responding to old dengue
vaccines. There are no old, commercially available dengue vaccines. What Dr
Kay probably said was that a new dengue virus serotype is circulating in
these areas and that existing immunity from previous infections by other
dengue virus serotypes is not protective against the virus serotype being
transmitted currently.

Dengue outbreak continues in the Parque Hundido neighborhood
------------------------------------------------------------
There are already 32 cases of classical dengue fever that have been
confirmed in Parque Hundido and surrounding neighborhoods of the Gomez
Palacio municipality, which is why the 'sanitary cordon' put in place by
the Health Jurisdiction No. 2 remains in effect.

The authorities have requested the collaboration of neighbors in prevention
tasks. Rosa Lilia Lopez Moreno, in charge of Health Jurisdiction No. 2,
signaled that the sanitary cordon actions put in place since the
confirmation of the 1st [dengue] patients will continue.

The Parque Hundido neighborhood continues to be the area most affected by
dengue, not only in the Gomez Palacio area, but in the whole of the Comarca
Lagunera, since it is worth mentioning that according to the health
authorities in Torreon, there has been no confirmation of the ailment there
[Comarca Lagunera is the large metropolitan area located on the border
between the states of Coahuila and Durango that includes 15 municipalities,
among them, Gomez Palacio. Torreon is adjacent to Gomez Palacio. - Mod.TY]

Emphasis was made on the need to eliminate all possible water catchments,
such as buckets, tubs, flower vases, and bottles; clean up patios; [and
additional measures such as] putting abate [mosquito larvicide] in
water-based heat pump systems, opening windows when the [insecticide]
fumigation machines pass by, and using [insect] repellants as well as
insecticides in the house. "We continue to request collaboration from the
citizens, which is required to obtain good results. Up until now, all of
the [dengue] cases that we have encountered have been in the Parque Hundido
neighborhood and the surrounding residential sectors," said the
jurisdiction chief.
