Taking CRISPR technology further
CRISPR techniques are allowing the development of technologies for nucleic acid detection (see the Perspective by Chertow). Taking advantages of the distinctive enzymatic properties of CRISPR enzymes, Gootenberg et al. developed an improved nucleic acid detection technology for multiplexed quantitative and highly sensitive detection, combined with lateral flow for visual readout. Myhrvold et al. added a sample preparation protocol to create a field-deployable viral diagnostic platform for rapid detection of specific strains of pathogens in clinical samples. Cas12a (also known as Cpf1), a type V CRISPR protein, cleaves double-stranded DNA and has been adapted for genome editing. Chen et al. discovered that Cas12a also processes single-stranded DNA threading activity. A technology platform based on this activity detected human papillomavirus in patient samples with high sensitivity.

Abstract
Mitigating global infectious disease requires diagnostic tools that are sensitive, specific, and rapidly field deployable. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cas13-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) platform can detect Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) in patient samples at concentrations as low as 1 copy per microliter. We developed HUDSON (heating unextracted diagnostic samples to obliterate nucleases), a protocol that pairs with SHERLOCK for viral detection directly from bodily fluids, enabling instrument-free DENV detection directly from patient samples in less than 2 hours. We further demonstrate that SHERLOCK can distinguish the 4 DENV serotypes, as well as region-specific strains of ZIKV from the 2015-2016 pandemic. Finally, we report the rapid ( less than 1 week) design and testing of instrument-free assays to detect clinically relevant viral single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

[Development and deployment of a rapid, field-deployable test that is sensitive enough to differentiate between the 4 dengue serotype viruses, and those viruses from Zika virus, will be a major contribution to diagnosis and surveillance of virus infections. It will be particularly useful for specific diagnosis of dengue virus infections for tracking incidence and geographic distribution of the various dengue virus serotypes over time. - Mod.TY]

Paixao ES, Teixeira M, Costa MN, Barreto ML, Rodrigues LC. Symptomatic Dengue during Pregnancy and Congenital Neurologic Malformations. 2018. 24(9): 1748-1750. doi: 10.3201/eid2409.170361.

Abstract. Dengue virus infection during pregnancy increased the risk for any neurologic congenital anomaly in the infant by roughly 50 percent and for other congenital malformations of brain 4-fold. Our results show an association between dengue during pregnancy and congenital anomalies of the brain, suggesting that flaviviruses other than Zika virus are associated with such malformations.

[Background]. We conducted a population-based study using routinely collected data from live births and from women who were notified and confirmed to have DENV infection during 2006-2012 in Brazil, before the introduction of Zika virus. We probabilistically linked records of mothers of live births with records of dengue notification to identify women who were reported as having dengue during pregnancy.

[Approach]. We used an outcome definition of congenital malformation of the nervous system coded as Q00-Q07 in International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). We defined dengue as a confirmed case of DENV infection notified during a pregnancy that resulted in a live birth. We estimated the association between symptomatic dengue during pregnancy and neurologic congenital malformations using the Firth method to reduce the small sample bias in maximum-likelihood estimation.

[Results]. The study parameters encompassed 16 103 312 live births. Neurologic congenital anomalies are rare; they occurred in 13 634 (0.08 percent) live births. Dengue during pregnancy increased the odds of a neurologic congenital anomaly by 50 percent (Table), but this result was not statistically significant (95 percent CI 0.97-2.27). We split the neurologic congenital defects into ICD-10 categories; the 95 percent CI around the estimated odds ratios (ORs) was not statistically significant in 7 categories, including microcephaly (OR 1.7, 95 percent CI 0.33-8.32); 2 other types of neurologic congenital anomalies were greater than 4 times more frequent in women who had DENV infection during pregnancy: other congenital malformations of spinal cord (OR 5.4, 95 percent CI 1.0-26.9) and other congenital malformations of brain (OR 4.5, 95 percent CI 1.7-11.3, which was statistically significant). We found no sign of space-time clusters or recording errors suggestive of a coding artifact in the 4 records of other congenital malformations of brain wherein the mother had DENV infection.

[Conclusion]. The association of symptomatic dengue during pregnancy and congenital anomalies of the brain in the infant, while not as high frequency as the linkage with Zika, opens the possibility of other flaviviruses causing congenital malformations and raises questions about policy implications. We recommend careful observation and recording of DENV infection in antenatal records and full investigation of live births with neurologic malformations, as well as animal and in vitro research of teratogenic effects of dengue.

[The conversation around congenital effects resulting from flavivirus infection has been dominated by the recent outbreak of Zika virus infections. The above report indicates that dengue virus infections during pregnancy should be considered as well. One wonders if there is greater fetal loss during pregnancy in women who have dengue virus infections, especially during the 1st trimester. - Mod.TY]

[4] WHO vaccine position paper

Introduction
In accordance with its mandate to provide guidance to member states on health-policy matters, WHO issues a series of regularly updated position papers on vaccines and combinations of vaccines against diseases that have an international public-health impact. These papers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes. They summarize essential background information on diseases and vaccines and conclude with the current WHO position on the use of vaccines worldwide.

The position papers are intended for use mainly by national public-health officials and managers of immunization programmes. They may also be of interest to international funding agencies, vaccine advisory groups, vaccine manufacturers, the medical community, the scientific media, and the general public.

This position paper replaces the 2016 WHO position paper concerning the 1st licensed dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV. In November 2017, results of a retrospective analysis of data from clinical trials, using a new serological assay, became available. The assay enabled classification of trial participants according to their dengue serostatus prior to receipt of the 1st vaccine dose. These data revealed an excess risk of severe dengue in seronegative vaccine recipients compared to seronegative non-vaccinated individuals, while confirming long-term protection in seropositive individuals. In view of these findings, SAGE provided revised recommendations in April 2018, on which this position paper is based. Evidence presented at the April 2018 SAGE meeting can be accessed at http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/previous/en/index.html.

Felipe J. Colon-Gonzalez, Ian Harris, Timothy J. Osborn, Christine Steiner Sao Bernardo, Carlos A. Peres, Paul R. Hunter, and Iain R. Lake. Limiting global-mean temperature increase to 1.5-2 deg C could reduce the incidence and spatial spread of dengue fever in Latin America. PNAS. 2018. 115(24): 6243-6248. doi: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1718945115.

Significance. This study is a multigeneral circulation model, multiscenario modeling exercise developed to quantify the dengue-related health benefits of limiting global warming to 1.5-2.0 deg C [2.7-3.6 deg F] above preindustrial levels in Latin America and the Caribbean. We estimate the impact of future climate change and population growth on the additional number of dengue cases and provide insights about the regions and periods most likely affected by changes in the length of the transmission season. Here, we show that future climate change may amplify dengue transmission and that significant impacts could be avoided by constraining global warming to 1.5 deg C [2.7 deg F] above preindustrial levels. Our work could be a starting point for future risk assessments incorporating other important drivers of disease such as urbanization and international traveling.

Abstract. The Paris Climate Agreement aims to hold global-mean temperature well below 2 deg C [3.6 deg F] and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 deg C [2.7 deg F] above preindustrial levels. While it is recognized that there are benefits for human health in limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C [2.7 deg F], the magnitude with which those societal benefits will be accrued remains unquantified. Crucial to public-health preparedness and response is the understanding and quantification of such impacts at different levels of warming. Using dengue in Latin America as a study case, a climate-driven dengue generalized additive mixed model was developed to predict global warming impacts using 5 different global circulation models, all scaled to represent multiple global-mean temperature assumptions. We show that policies to limit global warming to 2 deg C [3.6 deg F] could reduce dengue cases by about 2.8 (0.8-7.4) million cases per year by the end of the century compared with a no-policy scenario that warms by 3.7 deg C [6.7 deg F]. Limiting warming further to 1.5 deg C [2.7 deg F] produces an additional drop in cases of about 0.5 (0.2-1.1) million per year. Furthermore, we found that by limiting global warming we can limit the expansion of the disease toward areas where incidence is currently low. We anticipate our study to be a starting point for more comprehensive studies incorporating socioeconomic scenarios and how they may further impact dengue incidence. Our results demonstrate that although future climate change may amplify dengue transmission in the region, impacts may be avoided by constraining the level of warming.

Abstract. Despite estimates that, each year, as many as 300 million dengue virus (DENV) infections result in either no perceptible symptoms (asymptomatic) or symptoms that are sufficiently mild to go undetected by surveillance systems (inapparent), it has been assumed that these infections contribute little to onward transmission. However, recent blood-feeding experiments with _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes showed that people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic DENV infections are capable of infecting mosquitoes. To place those findings into context, we used models of within-host viral dynamics and human demographic projections to (1) quantify the net infectiousness of individuals across the spectrum of DENV infection severity and (2) estimate the fraction of transmission attributable to people with different severities of disease. Our results indicate that net infectiousness of people with asymptomatic infections is 80 percent (median) that of people with apparent or inapparent symptomatic infections (95 percent credible interval (CI): 0-146 percent). Due to their numerical prominence in the infectious reservoir, clinically inapparent infections in total could account for 84 percent (CI: 82-86 percent) of DENV transmission. Of infections that ultimately result in any level of symptoms, we estimate that 24 percent (95 percent CI: 0-79 percent) of onward transmission results from mosquitoes biting individuals during the pre-symptomatic phase of their infection. Only 1 percent (95 percent CI: 0.8-1.1 percent) of DENV transmission is attributable to people with clinically detected infections after they have developed symptoms. These findings emphasize the need to (1) reorient current practices for outbreak response to adoption of pre-emptive strategies that account for contributions of undetected infections and (2) apply methodologies that account for undetected infections in surveillance programs, when assessing intervention impact, and when modeling mosquito-borne virus transmission.

Author summary. Most dengue virus infections result in either no perceptible symptoms or symptoms that are so mild that they go undetected by surveillance systems. It is unclear how much these infections contribute to the overall transmission and burden of dengue. At an individual level, we show that people with asymptomatic infections are approximately 80 percent as infectious to mosquitoes as their symptomatic counterparts. At a population level, we show that approximately 88 percent of infections result from people who display no apparent symptoms at the time of transmission. These results suggest that individuals undetected by surveillance systems may be the primary reservoir of dengue virus transmission and that policy for dengue control and prevention must be revised accordingly.
