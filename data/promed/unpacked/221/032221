Tuberculosis Discovered In Wheeler County
-----------------------------------------

According to Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) State Veterinarian Dr. Dennis-Hughes, NDA and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) veterinarians have discovered a bovine tuberculosis (TB) positive cow in a beef cattle herd in Wheeler County. The Nebraska herd was identified through an epidemiological investigation from an infected herd in South Dakota (SD). [This is likely a trace out. In other words this was a trace of an animal having been sold from the herd of origin in SD to another herd. Hence, the animal went out of the original herd. - Mod.TG]

"Nebraska was contacted by the South Dakota Animal Industry Board earlier this year [2017] as they began to trace the movement of cattle into and out of their infected herd," said Hughes. "We have been diligently working with our counterparts in South Dakota and the USDA to locate and test the cattle that were moved into Nebraska, and through that testing procedure we discovered the TB positive cow in Wheeler County."

NDA and USDA are currently working together with the producer, who has been cooperating with both agencies. The herd is under quarantine.

"Our staff will be conducting a thorough investigation tracing the movement of cattle into and out of the Wheeler County herd," said Hughes. "We will also be working to locate any cattle that may have been pastured next to and had fence line contact with the infected herd. TB is primarily transmitted through nose to nose contact, so it is imperative that we work with those neighboring producers to test their cattle as well."

TB is a slow, progressive disease and is difficult to diagnose in the early stages; however, as the disease progresses, animals can exhibit emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and a pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. If a producer sees any of these clinical signs in their herd, they should contact their local veterinarian.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

The cooperative Federal-State-Industry effort to eradicate bovine TB from cattle in the United States has made significant progress since the program's inception in 1917. The disease has nearly been eliminated from the livestock population of the United States. Many consider this one of the great animal and public health achievements in the United States. However, our ultimate goal of eradication remains elusive as animal health officials continue to detect TB sporadically in livestock herds.

Signs
Q. What is bovine tuberculosis (TB)?
A. Bovine TB is a contagious, chronic bacterial disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_. The infection commonly involves the lungs, but it may spread to other organs. Animals often don't show signs until the infection has reached an advanced stage.

Q. What animals can it affect?
A. Bovine TB primarily affects cattle, but it can be transmitted to any warm-blooded animal, including people.

Q. What are the clinical signs of bovine TB?
A. Bovine TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymph nodes may also be enlarged.

Q. What should I do if my animals show these clinical signs?
A. If you suspect TB in your herd, you should isolate the animal immediately and then call your veterinarian for a proper diagnosis.

Q. How does TB get into cattle herds? [One of these ways may be how the disease reached Nebraska - Mod.TG]
A. TB can be introduced into a herd by infected animals or people. In the United States, the 2 most common methods of introduction are:

1) Purchase of or exposure to infected cattle, or
2) Exposure to infected free-ranging wildlife. The bacteria that causes bovine TB is found in the saliva of infected animals and spread through airborne particles from the respiratory tract. The bacteria can also spread through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other bodily discharges (urine, manure) or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation
