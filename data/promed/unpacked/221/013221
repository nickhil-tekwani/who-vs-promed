Re: Anthrax - Sweden (02): (OG) bovine, equine. OIE 20160801.4385781

The area where the outbreaks are occurring used to be an area for "summer sickness" (piroplasmosis/babesiosis) and such cases were not always confirmed by proper diagnostics. This means that ever since the last recorded anthrax outbreak in the area, sporadic cases in cattle, as well as in wild animals may have occurred.

Before the current requirements for identification and traceability of all bovines (that have been in place in the EU for almost 30 years), cattle deaths would not necessarily have been reported if only single animals. Even after the introduction of comprehensive identification and tracking systems, and bans on burial of bovines, individual dead animals could have been sent to destruction and simply reported as found dead without any suspicion of anthrax. Consequently, there may have been widespread (but low and sporadic) contamination in the area before this outbreak. The current outbreak has both increased awareness and subsequent reporting as well as exacerbated the contamination. Current hot weather increases insect activity and also reveals more ground when water levels decrease in the numerous streams and other water sources in the area. These water sources are shared by grazing animals and wildlife (even though grazing animals are provided with supplementary water), increasing indirect contacts.

Meanwhile, the outbreak management is focusing on proper disposal of dead animals and contaminated material, as well as mandatory vaccination of all ruminants in the area. Horses may be vaccinated as well but there is no requirement from the authorities. Horse owners may have more opportunities to choose other grazing areas but livestock farmers are sometimes under contract to keep grazing these areas for nature conservation purposes.

[Our thanks to Susanna for her insightful comment. Her communication included an interesting photograph of the region where these cases are occurring. It is tree cluttered, not dense but sufficient to hide a carcass if you are not used to watching buzzards and such circling in the sky. She may well be right that over the years sporadic anthrax cases have been missed from reporting and observation. It appears to be a wonderful opportunity for data collection and learning more about infection ecology in this area even though in the middle of the summer holidays. But that's what graduate students are for.

I am informed by a reliable and competent source that 2 more deaths were confirmed on 2 Aug 2016 - 1 bull in a new premise a couple of km south of all others, and 1 moose close to the 1st infected premise. An isolated case some 2 km [approx. 1 mi] from any others is not atypical of tabanid spread anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
