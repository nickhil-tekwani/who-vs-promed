The Proston community in Queensland, Australia has been taken over by more than a million bats, with some believed to be carrying deadly rabies diseases.

Residents have been left terrified of catching lyssavirus and Hendra virus as the infected colony of red flying foxes spreads.

The Australian bat viruses can be transmitted from bats through the transfer of saliva from bites or scratches and can cause serious illness, with 3 deaths being reported since 1996.

The viruses cause a similar illness known as rabies, which affects the central nervous system and is usually fatal.

The World Health Organization estimates that more than 55 000 people die from rabies worldwide each year.

When contracted by humans, lyssavirus begins with flu-like, including headache, fever, and fatigue and progresses rapidly to paralysis, delirium, convulsions and death, usually within a week or 2.

Symptoms of Hendra virus infection in humans range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease. There is no specific treatment for human cases of Hendra virus and cases often end in fatality, according to the World Health Organisation.

Residents have already found several sick and dead flying foxes around the town including in the local primary school playground, which is only 150 metres away from the colony, sparking fears the colony are infected by the deadly rabies.

The flying fox colony has the potential to begin affecting farms around the region as soon as their Proston food source runs dry.

"We're looking at the implications of these things travelling from where they are now and stripping bare nearby mango and avocado plantations," local Mayor Keith Campbell said.

"Once these bats find them and the fruit is ready to eat, there could be huge implications for the town and the region in general.

"The South Burnett Regional Council are working on a management plan that will be released to the community shortly."

The 1st colony of around 4000 arrived back in March [2018] to feed on the local blue and spotted gums.

They have since been joined by another camp of flying foxes and numbers have now reached epic proportions.

[Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species.

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is a potentially lethal zoonotic virus. It was first identified in 1996, and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.

A good article on the difference between rabies and Australian bat lyssavirus can be found at http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/infectious/factsheets/pages/rabies-australian-bat-lyssavirus-infection.aspx.

Hendra virus and Nipah virus (within the Paramyxovirinae subfamily) are highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses that have recently emerged from flying foxes to cause serious disease outbreaks in humans and livestock in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Bangladesh. Hendra virus was first described in 1994, and then spilled from flying foxes on multiple occasions causing equine and human fatalities.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventive measure. - Mod.PMB
