Patients with suspected anthrax, who were hospitalized last week [week of 25 Aug 2014], are now being treated at the central district hospital of the Uzunsky district of the Surxondaryo region of Uzbekistan. Patients contracted anthrax while slaughtering cattle.

"In the village of Kankul of the Uzunsky district 20 people who had participated in the slaughter and butchering of cattle were hospitalized in the regional infectious diseases hospital. It is assumed that all patients had contracted anthrax on [19 Aug 2014], in the village of Kankul Babataga, when they participated in the cattle slaughter. All were people who participated in the cutting of meat, cleaning the hide, and the sale of meat and fell ill over a period of 1-2 days. They have the typical ulcers on their bodies. 29 people were hospitalized. The population of the village panicked.

Cattle slaughter in the village has been temporarily prohibited and employees of the sanitary-epidemiological station disinfected all objects in the village.

A doctor from the Uzunsky district hospital for infectious diseases said that 22 people were treated in the hospital with the suspicion of anthrax.

It was 3 or 4 days after contamination [during slaughtering], and starting on 28 Aug 2014 that the patients began to seek medical aid. Out of about 30 people, 22 people were hospitalized. They had all participated in the cattle slaughter and butchering. All patients showed signs of anthrax, that is, dizziness, nausea, fever, the appearance on the body of the typical rash. However, laboratory diagnosis of anthrax was not confirmed. At present the cause of disease is unknown. All samples were sent to a regional laboratory for diagnosis. All patients with suspected anthrax now recovering.

The house in the village Karangal where the cattle were slaughtered was disinfected. 48 houses and about 180 people who were in contact with the meat were taken under strict medical oversight.

Recently in Uzbekistan there were more cases of poisoning and infections from meat and blood of cattle. 35 people in the area of the Havoc in the Syrdarya region in June this year [2014] were hospitalized with suspected anthrax [see ProMED-mail 20140710.2600959]. In particular, since 26 Jun 2014, 8 inhabitants of the village of Agasti of the Urgut district of Samarkand region were hospitalized; they fallen ill following the slaughtering of sick sheep. In June 2012, in the district of Kumasi of the Kashkadarya region 4 persons were hospitalized with a diagnosis of anthrax." They also had been infected from the slaughter of sick cattle.

Many locals have expressed concern that the cattle either did not pass the veterinary inspection or the cattle owner had received the permission to slaughter for a bribe, rumored in many villages. The meat was sold in the market that could then serve as a further source of anthrax and other diseases.

I greatly appreciate Sabine's and Natalia's work with this report and translation. The original report was written by an Uzbek person who does not have Russian as the primary native language. This probably explains the various anomalies in the script as to numbers and dates, but the overall story is clear enough, and one we hear frequently in Central Asia -- of sick cattle (with anthrax) being slaughtered and butchered, followed by human cases with cutaneous lesions. Whether gastroenteric cases followed upon the eating and marketing (outside the slaughtering and butchering group) of this meat has yet to be revealed. It also reinforces the impression that livestock anthrax is still out of control in eastern and southern Uzbekistan in spite of the claims of vaccinating 14 million head of livestock earlier this year (2014). - Mod.MHJ]
