Malaysia: 14 die in measles outbreak in Sarawak
-----------------------------------------------
13 children and an adult from a remote tribe have died in a measles
outbreak in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, on the Island of Borneo, a news
report in the Sunday Star stated on Sun 23 Jan 2005. The outbreak started
about 3 weeks ago, with the last death recorded a few days ago. The paper,
quoting Sarawak State Deputy Chief Minister George Chan, said 66 cases had
been recorded, with 14 deaths and some other cases which were "quite
serious." "We are trying to find out whether this is a new strain of the
virus and why the outbreak is so serious," Chan was quoted as saying.

The 13 dead children, aged 3 months to 5 years, and the man were from the
Penan tribe who lived in a communal longhouse in Belaga, near the Bakun
hydroelectric dam project site. Chan said the Penans in Belaga had never
been exposed to measles. However, one of the tribe members married a woman
from outside the area, and the couple returned to the settlement recently.

Health officials were not immediately available for comment.

Malaysia: measles-affected Bekun region of Sarawak quarantined
-----------------------------------------------
The central and interior regions of Bakun in Sarawak have been declared as
areas under quarantine beginning on Sun 23 Jan 2005, following a measles
outbreak that killed 13 children and an adult recently, the Health
Ministry's Communicable Disease Control Director, Dr. Ramlee Rahmat, said
on Sun 23 Jan 2005. He said the quarantine order was issued by the Sarawak
Health Department. "This is in order to prevent spread of the disease and
to assess the situation," he told Bernama here.

He said the Sarawak Health Department and the state government would
strictly enforce the quarantine order in the areas and advised the public
not to visit the areas until the outbreak had been contained. "We need to
assess the situation in order to determine the spread of the disease and to
contain the outbreak by controlling the movement of people in and out of
the area," he said.

Dr. Ramlee assured the public that the situation was under control and that
the Sarawak Health Department had been monitoring the situation closely
since the start of the outbreak. "The Sarawak Health Department and the
state government have managed it well, taking all precautions and
preventive measures," he said. Asked if the state health department had
asked for any assistance from the Health Ministry, Dr. Ramlee said that
"they have not asked" but expressed his confidence that they could handle
the situation well.

Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr. George Chan Hong Nam has been
reported as saying that a total of 66 measles cases had been recorded,
including the 14 deaths. He said those who died were from a longhouse in
Sungai Urun in Belaga, located near the Bakun project site, or about 150 km
inland from Bintulu.

Some of the residents from the Sungai Asap Resettlement Scheme had also
been affected and have been placed under strict observation and treatment
at Bintulu Hospital. Dr. Chan had said that the State Health and Medical
Services Department believed that the Penan community in Sungai Urun had
never been exposed to measles.

[A case fatality rate of 21 percent is similar to the measles case fatality
rates that are seen in areas with high levels of malnutrition and have been
reported in outbreaks among previously unexposed isolated populations. The
outbreak in Sarawak involves a remote tribe without prior exposure to
measles virus infection, although the deaths are primarily in the age group
one would expect (the 0-5 year olds). It would be interesting to know the
age distribution of the 66 cases, and the size of the population at risk. -
