[The following was sent to me, not necessarily for posting on ProMED-mail.
What with all the death, disease, and misery we report, I thought our
subscribers might like to see the following, but I have omitted the name of
the sender. He knows who he is, I hope. - Mod.CHC]
Mosquitoes that formerly fed on birds have acquired a taste for human blood
after decades of living in the London Underground system. The mosquito
population that moved into the London tunnels when they were dug 100 years
ago have slowly evolved, said a population geneticist at London
University's Queen Mary and Westfield College. Unable to find birds, the
mosquitoes began feeding on rats, mice and humans. Now they prefer the
blood of mammals, she said. The underground mosquitoes behave so
differently from their above-ground relatives that attempts to mate the two
failed. They appear to be completely distinct from each other.
While the report stopped short of calling the underground mosquitoes a new
species [Good for them. - Mod.CHC], they say the behavioral differences are
stark. The mosquitoes appear to feed, mate and reproduce differently. [I
would have posted the web site but it is R rated. - Mod.CHC] The
mosquitoes even have characteristics unique to the different Underground
lines. [That should make the taxonomy easier to work out. - Mod.CHC].
Researchers hope the mosquitoes can provide some answers about why and how
species make behavioral changes. [I assume plans are being made to question
them at a local police station. - Mod.CHC]

[A report in this week's The Lancet (352, August 22, 1998, page 634) says
that high frequency tones transmitted via radio drive mosquitoes away. A
radio station in Germany is broadcasting the usual programming but
simultaneously sending out the high frequency tones. Seems dogs and cats
also are repelled by the tones. Now, if we can get the Underground to
broadcast German radio we could kill two (maybe three) birds with one
stone. - Mod.CHC]
