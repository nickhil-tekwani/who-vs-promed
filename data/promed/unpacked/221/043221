[Phase 1 of the UK BSE Official Inquiry deals with establishing the
relevant facts. That phase is winding up and they are asking for comments
and/or evidence that people feel should have been included, as well as
warning them that the Inquiry is moving on to Phase 2. - Mod.MHJ

The following Invitation to contribute to Phase 2 of the BSE Inquiry now
appears on the BSE Inquiry Web Site.
[The website address is: <http://www.bse.org.uk/>
The first sentence of item 4 is directed to those of us who have pursued
the laborious and time-consuming task of reading the tens of thousands of
pages and witness statements appearing on the Inquiry Web site since March
-- and remember that, apart from Edwina Currie (who says she was only
marginally involved in BSE but has savored a sweet belated revenge on John
Major et al in her Witness Statement; the transcript of her evidence when
she was examined on 13 November has not yet appeared on the Web site ) --
the Ministers directly involved, in the period under examination, still
have to appear in phase 1.
The second sentence, however, spreads the invitation more widely.
No doubt there are subscribers who would wish to take up one or other (or
both) of those invitations.

THE BSE INQUIRY
INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO PHASE 2
1. Before moving into Phase 2 which will deal with clarifications,
conflicts of evidence and potential criticisms, the Committee of Inquiry
wishes to invite anyone who is interested to contribute any further
comments which may assist them in their task.
2. The Inquiry is now approaching the end of Phase 1. That process is
described in the Statement on Procedures of the Inquiry, which was
published on 3rd March 1998. During Phase 1, written statements and
documentary evidence have been received from a large number of individuals
and organisations who were involved in the BSE story, and public hearings
involving over 250 witnesses to date have been held since March.
3. The terms of reference of the Inquiry require the Committee "to
establish and review the history of the emergence and identification of BSE
and new variant CJD in the United Kingdom, and of the action taken in
response to it up to 20 March 1996". Thus the object of Phase 1 has been to
establish the relevant facts. The terms of reference also require the
Committee "to reach conclusions on the adequacy of that response, taking
account of the state of knowledge at the time; and to report on these
matters by 30 June 1999 to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,
the Secretary of State for Health and the Secretaries of State for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland". After the conclusion of Phase 1 of
the Inquiry, the Committee will turn to this issue, as well as to
clarification or resolution of conflicts of evidence.
4. As a first step in considering the adequacy of the response to BSE, the
Committee invites all concerned to notify it of any aspect of the BSE story
that they feel has not been properly covered by the evidence submitted and
heard so far, and in the remaining period of Phase 1. In addition to this,
the Committee also invites all concerned to draw attention to any matters
which, they consider contributed to a less than adequate response to the
problems posed by BSE up to 20th March 1996.
5. A full set of all materials used in the hearings, including published
witness statements and transcripts of oral evidence, is maintained for
reference by any member of the public on the 6th floor of Hercules House,
opposite the lift. In addition, witness statements and transcripts of oral
evidence are published and accessible on the Inquiry's Internet website.
6. Comments in response to these requests are invited by letter, fax,
e-mail or Internet. The relevant addresses and numbers are listed below. If
it is not intended that such comments should be published, please make this
clear. All responses will be fully and carefully considered by the Inquiry.
It would be of great assistance to the Committee if any responses could be
submitted by 5th January 1999.
