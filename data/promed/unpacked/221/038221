In the post Dengue/DHF update (09): Asia, Pacific archive number 20140127.2235170, Vanuatu was incorrectly identified as being in French Polynesia.

Vanuatu (formerly New Hebrides) is a Melanesian country in the Western Pacific situated 500 km (310 mi) northeast of New Caledonia, west of Fiji, and southeast of the Solomon Islands.

The islands of French Polynesia are located thousands of kilometers to the east of Vanuatu. See map at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/south_pacific_ocean_political_map.jpg.

ProMED-mail apologizes for the error and thanks Dr David Thompson for pointing out the error. - Mod.ML
