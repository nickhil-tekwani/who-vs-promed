According to AFP and other media sources, enterovirus 71 has been confirmed
as the cause of the epidemic in Taiwan that has claimed the lives of 38
children. The confirmation came as a result of an autopsy, Department of
Health spokesman Hsu Kuo-hsiung told the press.
He said tests on spine and brain tissues from an eight-year-old girl who
died last week showed that the virus had spread to the child's cranial
nervous system, damaging her brain and leading to heart and lung failure.
An estimated 200 000 children have been infected by the virus since
mid-May. And a leading pediatrician, Li Chin-yun of the National Taiwan
University, warns that the number could rise to half a million and that it
could spread to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

The US Centers for Disease Control have three experts in Taiwan working
with local epidemiologists, and two from Japan are due to arrive this week
to join in the search for the origin (currently suspected to have come to
Taiwan from abroad) and spread of the virus.

Enterovirus Outbreak in Taiwan, China
-----------------------------------------------
As of 15 June 1998, a total of 38 deaths among infants and young children
under five years of age have been reported in relation to an outbreak of
hand, foot and mouth disease which began in late April of this year in
Taiwan, China.
The health authorities estimate that up to 300 000 infants and children may
have been infected with enterovirus throughout the island. An increased
number of children have been hospitalised with aseptic meningitis or
encephalitis. Of those hospitalised many had a febrile illness of 2-4 days'
duration before sudden deterioration and death within 12 - 24 hours.
Enteroviruses have been isolated from stools, cerebrospinal fluid and
other specimens from fatal and non-fatal cases. While Enterovirus 71 has
been identified most often, it has not yet been confirmed as the
aetiological agent.
The local health authorities and a team from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, USA, continue to investigate the outbreak.

enteroviruses).

outbreak and enterovirus 71 - Mod.JW

Taipei, June 16 (CNA) Government health officials on Tuesday confirmed that
enterovirus type-71 is behind a viral epidemic that has claimed the lives
of 38 infants and children in Taiwan.
Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of Bureau of Communicable Disease Control
under the Department of Health, said that the confirmation was based on an
autopsy performed at Linkuo Chang Gung Memorial Hospital on an 8-year-old
female who had a viral infection. The autopsy revealed the presence of
enterovirus type-71 in the girl's spinal cord and medulla.
That discovery has led officials to believe that enterovirus type-71 first
attacks a person's central nervous system, causing a rise in blood pressure
and cerebral pressure, Hsu said. As the infection worsens, the victim falls
into coma and dies from complications of the infection, such as edema
pulmonary, meningitis or encephalitis.
Children under the age of 5 are most at risk of being infected, and common
symptoms of an infection include a fever and rash with ulcers on the hands,
feet and mouth, Hsu said.
Hsu said news of the discovery has been passed on to three experts from the
US Centers for Disease Control who are currently in Taiwan studying the
outbreak, adding that the Department of Heath will invite the doctors to
recommend appropriate treatment for those infected.
As there is no vaccine for the virus, Hsu repeated the suggestion that
parents keep their children away from public places and make sure that
children wash their hands often to reduce the risk of infection. (By Lin

ACUTE VIRAL INFECTION - TAIWAN
An extensive outbreak of a viral illness in Taiwan, suspected to be caused
by enterovirus 71 or perhaps a new adenovirus, is being reported by
multiple sources. According to various reports, a total of 30 children have
died with an estimated 200,000 infected children throughout the island.
Taiwanese health authorities are conducting an epidemiological
investigation of the cause with assistance from the US Centres for Disease
Control and Prevention. The cause and extent of the epidemic remain to be
confirmed. In the meantime, parents have been warned by Taiwanese
authorities not to bring their children to public places where they can be
exposed to the virus.
Enterovirus 71 was initially recognized as the cause of outbreaks of
aseptic meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain) and
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in children [from California
between 1969 and 1972, and has subsequently been reported in Sweden,
Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Bulgaria, Hungary, France, and the states of
New York, Alaska, Arkansas, and Pennsylvania. [and Malaysia (Sarawak) -
Mod.JW
The mode of transmission is presumed to be similar to that of most
enteroviruses, that is predominantly fecal-oral spread. Most symptomatic
infections occur in children less than 6 years old, and very young children
have a disproportionately high number of cases of encephalitis. Regardless,
it is apparent that the spectrum of clinical illness has varied
considerably among outbreaks of infection reported from different
locations.
There is no specific treatment for enterovirus 71. The management of the
illness is on a symptomatic basis.
Until the exact cause of this outbreak is more clearly defined and the
causative virus is clearly identified, families travelling with small
children to Taiwan should take the following precautions:
1. Avoid all crowded areas.
2. Wash hands before eating.
3. Observe strict personal hygiene, including thorough washing of the
hands after defecation and before handling food or caring for children.
4. Ensure cleanliness in the home and clean all shared toys carefully.
The Travel Medicine Program wishes to remind travellers to this area to
follow good hand washing practices.
Additional information will be posted as soon as it becomes available.
