Human health and pet rodents: guidance from HPA/AHVLA/PHW
---------------------------------------------------------
All rodents, including those kept as pets, should be presumed to be carrying infectious organisms even if they appear to be healthy and have no signs of infection, according to new guidance developed by the HPA (Health Protection Agency), the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) and Public Health Wales (PHW) [1].

The guidance was developed following the investigation of a case of serious illness (acute kidney injury) suffered by the keeper of a pet rat in south Wales, which was diagnosed as being due to a hantavirus [Seoul virus] infection. During that investigation, another case of renal illness in a person, linked to contact with pet rats, was identified. This had occurred some months previously but had not, at the time, been investigated for hantavirus [2]. Further investigations are being planned by HPA and AHVLA to more accurately estimate the prevalence of hantavirus among the rodent population in the UK [3].

The 1st UK strain of hantavirus linked to human disease was reported earlier this year [4]. This virus was detected in wild rats and is similar but not identical to that which has been found in pet rats [2].

[Hantaviruses (family _Bunyaviridae_, genus _Hantavirus_) are rodent-borne, zoonotic (acquired from animals), enveloped RNA viruses, and include the causative agents of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS occurs in Europe and Asia, while HPS occurs in North and South America. As for many infections, it is likely that asymptomatic or mild infections greatly outnumber characteristic symptomatic infections.

Each hantavirus is specific to a different rodent host. Once infected the rodent will secrete infectious virus for prolonged periods, probably for life. Transmission of virus to human occurs through the inhalation of infected animal excreta and fluids, i.e. urine, faeces and saliva.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a group of clinically similar illnesses occurring worldwide, and including Korean hemorrhagic fever, epidemic hemorrhagic fever, and nephropathis epidemica. The viruses that cause HFRS include Hantaan, Dobrava, Seoul, and Puumala. The incubation period is generally 2-4 weeks (range 2 days to 8 weeks). Infection with these viruses can cause a disease characterised by fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms and renal dysfunction. The more severe forms of disease have haemorrhagic manifestations. Dobrova and Hantaan viruses cause a more severe HFRS with fever, haemorrhage, and renal failure, and a mortality rate of up to 15 percent. Seoul virus causes a moderately severe disease resembling that due to Hantaan virus. Haantan virus is widely distributed in eastern Asia, particularly in China, Russia, and Korea. Puumala virus is found in Scandinavia, western Europe, and Russia. Dobrava virus is found primarily in the Balkans, and Seoul virus is found worldwide.
