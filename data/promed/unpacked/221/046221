I would like to offer one minor correction in the comment section in
the following commentary. The definition of zooanthroponosis and
anthropozoonosis is often confused because the opposites are used in
the Russian literature.
Anthropozoonses are those diseases where the direction of
transmission is from animals to man (such as rabies).
Zooanthroponoses are those diseases where the direction of
transmission is from man to animals (such as tuberculosis).

With reference to the ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance in
Chimpanzees in Uganda, I think it is very important that field
researchers, tourists, and Park staff should be required to carry a
tool into the bush so that if they must defecate, they can bury the
result at least 15 inches (38 cm.) deep or deeper, out of reach of
the waiting flies. Similarly, the now-ubiquitous paper tissues
carried by tourists should be buried or burnt after use or carried
out of the Park for safe disposal. I have seen a young gorilla snatch
up and eat a tissue into which a tourist had just blown his nose.
Likewise, foodstuffs carried into National Parks (if this is
permitted) should be completely consumed before contact with wild
animals and the wrappings and any unconsumed food carried out of the
Protected Area for safe disposal.

[Thanks very much to our readers for these additional useful comments.
I particularly appreciate Jeff Bender catching my oversight of the
correct directionality for zooanthroponosis and anthropozoonosis. It
may useful to look at the Greek roots of these words: anthropo- man,
zoon- animal, and nosos, disease.
Unfortunately, I left off studying Latin way too early and am far
from being a classics scholar. Of course, as Jeff mentioned, the
Russians view these terms with opposite meaning and I suspect there
are no etymological imperatives to indicate a correct directionality. - Mod.PC]
