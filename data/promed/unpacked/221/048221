Egypt Health Ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghaffar said on Mon [19 Jan 2015] in Cairo that the country has recorded another death of bird flu, the 4th in the country this year [2015], Punch reports. He said a 47-year-old woman in Assiut province, a rural area where an avian flu death was reported last week, has also died of the virus.

According to Vanguard, Abdel-Ghaffar said that there are 2 other cases currently been treated, bringing the total number of cases in Egypt to 20 this year [2015] so far. "This includes 4 deaths as well as 6 recoveries and 10 cases still under treatment," he said.

The World Health Organisation stated that there has been an increase in the number of avian flu infections in people in Egypt, adding that more than 10 people died from the disease in Egypt in 2014. The organisation said that between 4 Dec 2014 and 6 Jan 2015, there had been 18 new laboratory confirmed human cases in Egypt, including 4 deaths, the highest ever monthly number of human cases in the country.

It also said that whenever bird flu viruses are circulating in poultry, there are risks of sporadic infections or small clusters of human cases. Egypt's avian flu cases have largely been in poor rural areas in the south, where villagers tend to keep and slaughter poultry products themselves. Meanwhile, all chicken markets in Lagos State and surrounding areas have been placed on red alert after the bird flu outbreak that was reported last week in 2 poultry [farms] in Lagos and Kano states.
