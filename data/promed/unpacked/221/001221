Chile finds H1N1 swine flu in turkeys
-------------------------------------
Chile detected the H1N1 swine flu virus in turkeys, authorities said
on Thursday, the first time the virus has been found outside humans
or pigs.

Chile's farming and livestock agency SAG said the flu outbreak had
been controlled at the two farms 120 km [75 mi] west of the capital
Santiago.

"We call on the public to consume turkey products with confidence," a
SAG statement said. It added that laboratory results ruled out the
presence of H5N1 or bird flu virus.

The Geneva-based World Health Organization declared H1N1 a full
pandemic in June [2009] and the virus has now spread to some 180
countries, causing at least 1462 laboratory-confirmed deaths. The WHO
says the pandemic is unstoppable.

The H1N1 swine flu virus was first seen in March [2009] in Mexico and
California. Experts say at least 1 million people have been infected
in the United States alone.

Genetic tests show the virus appears to have originated in pigs but
it is now spreading from human to human.

The head of the WHO, Margaret Chan, said this week that the world
must remain on guard against the H1N1 flu, which has been mild so far
but could become more serious as the northern hemisphere heads into
winter.

Chile detects and controls an outbreak of swine flu in turkeys: official
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chilean health authorities announced on Thursday night [20 Aug 2009]
that they had detected and controlled an outbreak of swine flu in 2
turkey farms, according to a communication from the Agricultural and
Livestock Service (SAG).

"The presence of an influenza type A virus was detected in 2 farms in
the Valparaiso Region, and immediate precautionary measures were
adopted to prevent the dissemination of the disease and to protect
the population's health," said the text.

The finding was made on [13 Aug 2009] in farms from the port of
Valparaiso, 120 km [75 mi] west of Santiago, when the commercial
turkey producer Sopraval informed of a decrease in egg production.

Following this [discovery] there several analyses were made. On
Wednesday [19 Aug 2009], avian flu was ruled out (influenza virus
H5N1) and the presence of an influenza virus subtype H1N1 was made
"which is common in turkeys," according to SAG.

"This afternoon [20 Aug 2009] the virus was identified as subtype A
(H1N1) 2009, which was communicated to the World Organization of
Animal Health (OIE)," according to the SAG press release.

"As a precautionary measure a quarantine of the farm was established,
and mitigation measures were implemented, which included increasing
biosafety of persons in the involved facilities, as well as the
control of movement of the birds and laboratory testing to prevent
the spread of the disease," added the text.

SAG assured the "the implementation of protocols and measures of
prevention and control" make it possible to "assure the population
that turkey meat and products that are marketed in both the domestic
and the international markets, are totally fit for human consumption."

The agency also stated that "there is no evidence of disease
elsewhere in the country."

The Health Ministry said on Wednesday [19 Aug 2009] that there were
116 fatal cases and more than 1200 infected humans with the swine flu
[pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus] in Chile, and the numbers are now
decreasing.

[This would be a very unusual jump from humans and a few swine to
avians. While swine are the mixing vessels for these vaccines, the
normal route is avian, swine, people. Currently swine are being
infected by people, so this would be an extremely unusual occurrence.
We would request more information regarding this occurrence and the
sequences that have lead to this revelation. - Mod.TG]
