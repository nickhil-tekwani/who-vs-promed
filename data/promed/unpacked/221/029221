The Department of Health says there has been a recent increase in unrelated cases of _Escherichia coli_ [infection] in Newfoundland and Labrador. A spokesperson from the department told CBC News on Wednesday [28 Jul 2021] [that] there have been 12 cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) [also called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli (EHEC)] since the end of May 2021. The cases have been located in the Eastern, Central and Western Health regions of the province. In previous years, fewer than 5 cases of STEC would be reported in Newfoundland and Labrador during that same time frame, the spokesperson said.

In a media release on Wednesday [28 Jul 2021], the health department said public health officials, along with the province's regional health authorities, are working with Digital Government and Service NL to investigate.

EHEC is spread primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, said the Department of Health, adding person-to-person transmission can also occur. "Careful food preparation techniques and hand washing are important in the prevention of _E. coli_", reads the media release. "Anyone with severe diarrhea, bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain should seek medical attention. Food handlers, healthcare workers, daycare workers and children attending daycares with these symptoms should remain at home until the symptoms are resolved and they are cleared by a healthcare professional."

[It is stated that the cases are unrelated, but it is unclear if the isolates have been compared by molecular techniques or if they are of various serotypes.

EHEC is most often associated with undercooked ground beef or other contaminated food, including produce; the disease can also be transmitted when people drink, or swim in, tainted water. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, other livestock or wild animals or humans. In the spring of 2000, in Walkerton, a town of 5000 in southern Ontario, an outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection claimed 7 lives -- 6 adults and a child -- and over 200 were seen at local area hospitals.

Newfoundland and Labrador is the easternmost province of Canada, in the country's Atlantic region. It is composed of the island of Newfoundland and the continental region of Labrador to the north west. - Mod.LL
