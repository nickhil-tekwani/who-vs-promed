The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza (AI). A 31-year-old male from the
Bengkalis District, Riau Province developed symptoms on 31 Oct
[2007], was hospitalized on 3 Nov [2007], and died in an AI referral
hospital on 6 Nov [2007].

Identification of the source of his infection is ongoing and includes
investigation into a large swallow farm in close proximity to the
case's house.

Of the 113 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 91 have been fatal.

[This appears to be the same fatal case of avian influenza virus
infection reported in ProMED-mail archive 20071111.3656. However, the
current report (above) is the 1st that explicitly mentions close
proximity to a swallow farm. The birds are undoubtedly bird nest soup
swiftlets (_Collocalia fuciphaga_, although its specific and
subspecific taxonomic status is debated), raised for their very
expensive nests. Indonesia exports 27 tonnes of nests annually, which
indicates the magnitude of this industry. The status of the swiftlets
as H5N1 virus hosts is unknown and the results of the investigation
will be of interest. Images of these birds and their nests can be
seen at
