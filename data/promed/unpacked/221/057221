[Continuing good news at a time we really need it! The DRC is halfway towards calling the Ebola outbreak over. But the country must maintain intensive surveillance and preparedness to prevent resurgence of this disease. - Mod.LK]

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has reached 21 days with no new cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD), a promising milestone in the nation's longest outbreak, which began in August of 2018.

"On 9 Mar [2020], the last 46 contacts finished their follow-up," the World Health Organization (WHO) wrote in an update. "These are important milestones in the outbreak as over one maximum incubation period has passed without any confirmed cases of EVD. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of EVD and a critical need to maintain response operations."

According to the WHO, the outbreak total stands at 3444 cases in 29 health zones in northeastern DRC. The outbreak includes 2264 fatalities (overall case fatality rate 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable case-patients, 56% (1931) were female, 28% (975) were children, and 5% (171) were healthcare workers, the WHO said.

The next milestone will be when the DRC completes 42 days with no new cases, or 2 Ebola transmission cycles, and the country can officially be called Ebola-free. Though 2 effective vaccines were deployed during this outbreak, the disease spread in part because the outbreak region is home to a mobile population and thousands of militias who targeted medical responders in violent attacks that halted response work for weeks at a time.

- 12 Mar 2020. WHO Disease Outbreak News: Update
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response; Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-March-2020-ebola-drc/en/

It has been over 21 days since the last confirmed case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been reported (Figure 1). On 9 Mar [2020], the last 46 contacts finished their follow-up. These are important milestones in the outbreak as over one maximum incubation period has passed without any confirmed cases of EVD. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of EVD, and a critical need to maintain response operations as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.

Extensive surveillance, pathogen detection, clinical management, and other response activities are currently ongoing. These include, but are not limited to, investigating and validating new alert cases, supporting appropriate care and rapid diagnostics of suspected cases that continue to be detected each day, and supporting survivors through a multi-disciplinary programme to help mitigate potential risks of re-emergence. Over the course of the past week (4-10 Mar 2020), over 32 000 alerts were reported and investigated, and 2584 alerts were validated as suspected cases, requiring specialized care and laboratory testing to rule out EVD. From 2-8 Mar [2020], 2818 samples were tested, including 1574 blood samples from alive, suspected cases; 376 swabs from community deaths; and 868 samples from re-tested patients. Overall, this was a 16% decrease in testing compared to the previous week.

Throughout the outbreak, alert rates steadily climbed as active and passive case-finding systems were strengthened, reaching additional health zones with the evolution of the outbreak, and continuously adapted to suit local context. With the decline in confirmed case incidence and gradual transition toward routine disease surveillance systems, alert rates have expectantly begun to decline in some areas. However, it remains important for appropriate levels of surveillance to be maintained through the end of outbreak declaration to rapidly detect relapse, reintroduction, or new emergence events, thereby providing an opportunity to implement effective control measures and avoid a potential resurgence of the outbreak.

As of 10 Mar 2020, a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality rate 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1931) were female, 28% (n=975) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were healthcare workers.

Data in recent weeks are subject to delays in case confirmation and reporting, as well as ongoing data cleaning. "Non-active zones" indicate health zones that have not reported new cases in the last 42 days.)
