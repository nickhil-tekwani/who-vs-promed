_Salmonella_ are normal inhabitants of the GI tract of reptiles I recall
from an earlier [ProMED-mail posting that there are some 50 known species
of _Salmonella_. How many of these are dangerous to humans? Also, what are
the odds that one of these strains are present in any given reptile?
I understand that reptiles are intermittent shedders of _Salmonella_ sp.,
thus making it hard to tell what species is present in a given reptile.
Reptiles have been kept as pets for a long time. Pet shops have been
selling reptiles for years too. Why don't we see reports of pet shop
personnel with _Salmonella_ infections? Why are we now seeing serious
infections in reptile owners, that were not being reported in the past?

[The US Centers for Disease Control receives approximately 40 000 reports
of culture-confirmed salmonellosis per year, and estimates that the true
incidence is at least 20 times higher than that. The CDC also refers to
approximately 200 serotypes of _Salmonella_ known to cause human illness
(see CDC website at <http://www.cdc.gov>).
There has probably always been a lot of reptile-derived infections among
handlers and pet owners, but much of the disease may go undiagnosed and
resolves spontaneously. The very young, and immunocompromised are at
greatest risk. The first ProMED-mail reference, cited again above as it
was in the last posting, answers some of the questions posed here
concerning the apparent increase in cases observed in recent years. In
summary, more people are keeping reptiles as pets. Prior experience with
limiting the distribution of small turtles when they were popular effected
a 77% decrease in cases caused by turtle-associated serotypes. Currently
the CDC estimates that 7% of total _Salmonella_ infections can be traced to
reptile handling.
Many serotypes are found in reptiles. One published study examined 12
green iguanas and all 12 shed salmonellae in their feces. Eleven different
serotypes were identified. 83% of 106 fecal samples yielded a positive
culture. - Mod.ES
