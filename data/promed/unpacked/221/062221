SARS virus isolated, new diagnostic test producing reliable results
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A team of scientists in the department of microbiology, University of Hong
Kong, has announced today success in culturing the viral agent that causes
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Further progress in the
development of a reliable diagnostic test was simultaneously announced by
the same team.
Using a special cell line, the Hong Kong scientists isolated the virus from
the lung tissue of a patient who developed pneumonia following contact with
a professor from Guangdong Province in southern China. Both the professor
and the contact have died. Isolation of the virus now lays the solid
foundation for very rapid development of a diagnostic test.
The Hong Kong scientists have devised a basic test, relying on the
technique of neutralizing antibodies. In todays experiments, designed to
determine the accuracy of the test, scientists found that it was able to
detect tell-tale antibodies in sera taken from 8 SARS patients. The
consistency of these findings indicates that the test is reliably
identifying cases of SARS infection.
This "hand-made" test will now be further developed into a more
sophisticated diagnostic test. A rapid and reliable diagnostic test for
SARS is needed urgently to assist the many clinicians who need a tool for
rapid confirmation of genuine cases. Such a test can also help reassure the
many "worried well" who are flooding health facilities as international
concern about this disease and its rapid spread to new areas continues to
increase. Many common and usually self-healing illnesses mimic the symptoms
of SARS in its early stage.
With the virus now isolated, scientists in Hong Kong and elsewhere can move
forward quickly to characterize the agent, determine its relationship with
known viruses, and establish a definitive identity. Results will be shared
among 11 leading laboratories in a network set up on Mon 17 Mar 2003 by WHO.
The virus responsible for SARS is considered by some research groups to be
a member of the well-known Paramyxoviridae family. Yesterday, Canadian
researchers released findings suggesting that the metapneumovirus, which
belongs to this family, may be the cause. The metapneumovirus was first
discovered by Dutch scientists in June 2001 at a laboratory that is also
included in the new WHO network. At the time of its discovery, the virus
was known to cause respiratory disease in humans, including some cases of
pneumonia, but showed a different transmission pattern and was much less
severe than the SARS agent. At this point, it cannot be ruled out that an
entirely different virus from another family may be responsible for the
SARS outbreak.
WHO cautions that the race to identify the SARS causative agent is by no
means over. Although the virus has now been isolated, its identity remains
elusive. Other research groups in the network of collaborating labs are
producing hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family.
SARS is an emerging disease, first recognized in Asia in mid-February 2003,
that has made over 380 people ill on 3 continents and caused severe
pneumonia in a large proportion of patients. A cumulative list of affected
countries and numbers of cases and deaths is released each day on the WHO
website. Todays data indicate that slightly more than half of currently
reported cases have occurred in health care workers and medical students.
The remaining cases are in family members and other persons in close
contact with patients.
A WHO team of 5 experts is now en route to China to investigate the
possibility that an outbreak of a disease having similar symptoms and
affecting similar groups ­- health care workers and close contacts of
patients -­ may be linked to the current SARS outbreak.
As of today, Hong Kong remains the most seriously affected area.
Authorities there have reported a total of 222 cases in health care
workers, medical students, and family members and hospital visitors who
have been in close contact with patients. Of these, 217 have developed
symptoms of pneumonia, and many are in serious condition.

[We join in praising the international collaboration whose work has led to
such rapid promising results. Until larger numbers of cases and healthy
controls are studied, it is still prudent to maintain a state of cautious
optimism that the putative etiologic agent -- a member of the paramyxovirus
family -- is in fact the causative agent of SARS. The rapid development of
a diagnostic test, perhaps considered somewhat "basic" is yet another step
in the process of learning more about the etiology and epidemiology of this
emerging disease. - Mod.MPP]
[The important fact to emphasize is the successful propagation of an
infectious agent from SARS patients in cultured cells; in other respects
the situation remains confused. Several laboratories in the WHO
Collaborating Network, on the basis of electron microscopy (not the method
of choice), have suggested that the etiologic agent is a "paramyxovirus".
Subsequently some Canadian virologists have suggested that the agent is a
"metapneumovirus", although others had claimed to have excluded from
consideration the recently discovered human metapneumovirus (and its
distant relative human respiratory syncytial virus). Now apparently "other
research groups in the WHO network of collaborating labs are producing
hints that the causative agent may belong to another virus family". It is
to be hoped that WHO will take the lead in resolving this confusion by
distributing clinical material and susceptible cell cultures to all the
participating laboratories as quickly as feasible. - Mod.CP]
