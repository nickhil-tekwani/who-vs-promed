Cured deer meat is believed to be behind a series of _E. coli_ cases in Tavistock. Oxford County Public Health says they can't confirm it yet, but they believe the illnesses were caused by the meat which was sourced and processed from 2 private hunt camps in December 2017.

The 1st case was reported by a Tavistock resident in mid-February 2018 with the 2nd coming a month later in March 2018 and a 3rd in the 1st week of April 2018. They say laboratory results, expected later this week [week of Sun 8 Apr 2018], will confirm if _E. coli_ is present in the deer meat.

[Although Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ are classically associated with cattle, other animals can also be colonized in their gastrointestinal tract with this pathogen including pigs, sheep, deer, and elk. As examples of the association of non-cattle ruminants and this pathogen, _E. coli_ O157 has been isolated in wild deer (1), linked to deer meat jerky (2), and deer and elk droppings have been suggested to be the source of waterborne _E. coli_ O157 (3).
