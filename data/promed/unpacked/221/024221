The death of thousands of fish for reasons yet unknown has prompted concern
among the residents of the northeastern Bahia de Samana, a favorite
destination for tourists.
Sen. Milton Ray Guevara of the opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party
said that the phenomenon was first detected in the municipality of Santa
Barbara and that it later extended to other areas.
He said area residents were worried, not just about the dead fish and the
cause of their death, but because tourism is important to the region.
Ray Guevara asked for government help, noting that some people who ate the
fish suffered food poisoning.
The senator added that suspicions for the death of the fish fell on
drillings of the sea bottom and dredging along the coast of Santa Barbara,
being done in connection with the construction of a large tourist resort.
