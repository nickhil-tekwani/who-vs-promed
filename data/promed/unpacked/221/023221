Plague cases may rise; wetter weather in state aiding increase in rodents
and fleas
-----------------------------------------------
Bubonic plague has sickened one Colorado woman this month [May 2005], and
the wetter weather means more cases may be on the way, especially in rural
areas.
The woman, who lives in La Plata County in southwestern Colorado, is
recovering after spending time in a hospital, said the Colorado Department
of Public Health and Environment. She probably got it from a flea that
jumped off her cat and bit her, say epidemiologists.
People visiting rural campgrounds, picnic spots and wilderness areas also
should be cautious.
Bubonic plague is a highly infectious bacterial disease of rodents that is
spread by their fleas. Human cases are infrequent and can be treated easily
with common antibiotics when recognized early. Otherwise, they can be
life-threatening.
The wetter weather, combined with the 5- to 10-year cycle of plague in the
western United States, means Colorado could see more plague this year
[2005], said John Pape, an epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related
diseases for the health department. The damper weather gave rise to more
plants for rodents to eat, so their numbers grew. Lower temperatures also
allow fleas to survive longer on their rodent hosts, Pape said.
Earlier this year [2005], a plague-positive cat was reported in Douglas
County. A positive squirrel was found in El Paso County and, most recently,
a positive rabbit was found in Jefferson County. Rapid die-offs of rodents
and rabbits, a telltale sign of plague, have been reported from several
areas of the state, Pape said.
Bubonic plague:
Symptoms emerge 2 to 6 days after infection:
* A sudden onset of high fever
* Muscle pain
* Malaise or a general feeling of being ill
* Nausea and vomiting
* A large swollen, painful lymph node, usually in the groin or armpit

[Sporadic cases of bubonic plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, continue to
occur in the rural areas of the Western US. The CDC web site states: "In
the United States, the last urban plague epidemic occurred in Los Angeles
in 1924-25. Since then, human plague in the United States has occurred as
mostly scattered cases in rural areas (an average of 10 to 15 persons each
year). Globally, the World Health Organization reports 1000 to 3000 cases
of plague every year." Plague bacillus is considered a Category A
bioterrorist agent by CDC.
An excellent description of the pathogenesis of bubonic plague and further
references can be found in the ProMED-mail archived report: Plague, human,
