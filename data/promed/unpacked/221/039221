[According to the most recent available periodic report of Greece to the OIE, namely January-June 2013, during the covered period 94 outbreaks of BTV-4 have been reported (locations not provided). Since no immediate notifications of BT were submitted by Greece during 2013, it may be assumed that the reported outbreaks were continuous in the same geographic area affected during 2012, namely the Aegean islands facing the Turkish coast. According to the current report, the last outbreak there occurred in August 2013.

The current penetration of BTV-4 to continental Greece (Peloponnese region), a region which has not witnessed BT virus activity for about 10 years, is expectedly followed by a speedy, wide spread within the susceptible, unvaccinated sheep population. Goats and cattle are known to be clinically affected by this serotype rarely, if at all.

The reported low in-herd morbidity is rather surprising but may probably be attributed to a low density of the _Culicoides_ population during early stages of the vector season. The reported case-fatality rate (13.8 percent) is also rather low; BTV-4 is long known to be considerably pathogenic, particularly in susceptible sheep breeds (such as Sardinian dairy sheep, Chios sheep, mutton merinos). The reported use of insecticides and repellents ("control of arthropods") in the affected Greek flocks may have suppressed the vector activity; it will be interesting to follow the further development of this epizootic. - Mod.AS
