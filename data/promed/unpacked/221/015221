ANNOUNCEMENTS (07): JOIN THE DENGUE FEVER PREDICTION MARKETS

The Iowa Electronic Health Markets (IEhM) at the University of Iowa
invites you to participate in a project designed to forecast dengue
related events. Perspectives from health experts like you will
contribute to prediction of future disease trends.

The project is funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Pioneer
Portfolio. Additional information can be found at the project website
at <http://iehm.uiowa.edu>.

What is the purpose? Prediction markets "average" the predictions of
participants to create a consensus forecast and have been used to
forecast a broad range of events from political elections to business
trends to influenza activity. Current dengue markets attempt to
predict the spread of dengue fever. They ask participants to predict:
(1) the total number of US dengue cases in 2010, (2) the percentage
increase in clinical dengue in the Americas in 2010, and (3) the
number of US states that will report locally acquired dengue cases in
2010. New questions will be added over time and will focus on other
geographic locations worldwide and on other diseases.

Why is your input important? Disease activity from the recent past may
help anticipate disease activity in the near future. However, experts'
experience from the field and observations from past outbreaks are
difficult to collect and synthesize. By contributing your experience
and knowledge via your participation in these dengue markets, you will
help us predict future dengue activity. These types of predictions
have the potential to influence policy and response to disease
outbreaks.

You can join this project by going to <http://iehm.uiowa.edu>. Click
on the "sign up" button and complete the application.

What is involved? Participants are given accounts with 100 units of a
virtual currency with which to trade. Participants make predictions
which lead to the purchase and sale of contracts at specific prices.
Over time, buyers can change their predictions, sell contracts from
earlier predictions, and buy contracts for their new predictions.
Prices increase for contracts that most buyers want, and prices
decrease for the contracts that few people want. Thus prices reflect
the collective prediction of market participants.

These markets do not involve real money. We anticipate that trading
will only take a few minutes a week and that you will find it to be an
enjoyable experience.

Why a market instead of a survey? Prediction markets aggregate
professional opinion, they are interactive, continuously available,
and have proven to be more accurate than opinion polls and surveys in
several contexts. They were first used to predict election outcomes.
Google, Hewlett Packard, and Best Buy have used prediction markets to
help forecast consumer demand. In the field of health, prediction
markets have provided accurate forecasts of seasonal influenza
activity within individual states, 2009 novel H1N1 influenza activity
across the US, and H5N1 influenza worldwide.

Who can participate? Diverse groups work best. Our goal is to recruit
a broad range of public health officials, physicians, nurses,
epidemiologists, laboratorians, ecologists, infectious disease
specialists, and others with access to information about dengue
activity.

If you join, we will endow your account with 100 "dengue dollars". As
you trade, your balance will grow or shrink depending on the accuracy
of your predictions. Your account balance will allow you to track the
accuracy of your predictions and help compare them to the predictions
of others.

Ideas for other markets? Please let us know. These dengue markets were
suggested by Tara Kirk Sell and Crystal Franco at the Center for
Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburg Medical Center. If you have
ideas for emerging infectious disease markets contact us at
<iehm@uiowa.edu>. Our goal is to provide a platform for, and access
to, a community interested in helping to aggregate information about
infectious diseases.
