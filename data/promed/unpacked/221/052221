The 3-day 25th National Congress of Parasitology titled "Global Challenges in the Management of Parasitic Diseases" jointly organized by the Indian Society of Parasitology and CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), which commenced on Thursday [16 Oct 2014], saw discussion on malaria hogging the limelight.

Malaria as a major public health problem in tribal areas of India was brought forth by Dr Neeru Singh, director of the Regional Medical Research Centre for Tribals (ICMR), Jabalpur. She said that analysis carried out at the district level revealed that districts with a 30 percent or more tribal population (comprising about 8 percent of the country's population) contribute to 46 percent of total malaria cases and 47 percent of malaria deaths in the country. The presentation also discussed various operational issues and challenges in malaria control and prevention in tribal areas.

Director of CDRI Dr SK Puri, while speaking on the occasion, highlighted the contribution of the institute during the past more than 6 decades in the field of parasitic diseases. Padma Bhushan awardee Dr VP Sharma, former director of India's Malaria Research Institute and an eminent parasitologist, stressed the need for more proactive efforts from scientists and students in dealing with the nuances of parasitic diseases. He further said that drug resistance has emerged as a major threat in recent years and asked the scientists to also think of adopting new vector control strategies, especially in the tribal areas of India, to check the menace of parasitic diseases.

Director general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Dr PS Ahuja stressed the need to detect and tackle parasitic diseases at an early stage so that intervention can be started at the earliest. Dr SL Hoti, president of the Indian Society of Parasitology, asked the scientists to take advantage of the large biodiversity of India and translate leads generated from traditional medicine approaches to help infected individuals.

[The posting underlines the uneven distribution of malaria in India. A map of the distribution of malaria can be downloaded from the WHO World Malaria Report 2013 at http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/country-profiles/profile_ind_en.pdf?ua=1.

Over the past 12 years, the point prevalence has declined from 2 cases per 1000 population to just below 1 per 1000 population. However, these figures are based on official notifications, and, most probably, there are cases which are not notified; the official figures should be interpreted with caution. - Mod.EP
