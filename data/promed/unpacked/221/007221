Re: Porcine reprod & resp syndr - China (Guangdong): OIE
--------------------------------------------------------
I wonder if anyone has included African swine fever [ASF] in
diagnostic investigations of the syndrome. It is not only clinically
and pathologically virtually indistinguishable from classical swine
fever but has a demonstrated record of ability to spread globally.
China has a strong and increasing presence in Africa where the
disease is widespread and it is not beyond the realm of possibility
that a returning worker could have brought back some infected pork as
happened in Belgium some years ago.

[The disease, which obtained in China the name "High fever disease"
since its 1st known detection in mid-2006, was initially attributed
to a mix infection of PRRS, classical swine fever (CSF) and porcine
circovirus (PCV-2), and probably additional agents; see China's
notification to the OIE of 14 Sep 2006, included in posting
20060924.2732. According to the recent Chinese notification to the
OIE of 9 May 2007, a similar syndrome in Guandong was "probably
caused by highly pathogenic Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory
Syndrome (PRRS) virus" while "laboratory diagnosis was ongoing".
ProMED-mail commented that the apparent case fatality rate (20
percent) hardly fits the description "sub-clinical" used in the
notification, and underlined the need for additional data on the PRRS
virus, currently circulating in vast areas of China and Vietnam, and
for the exclusion of other disease agents such as avian influenza
and classical swine fever (CSF); see commentary in archived 20070514.1533.
Dr. Roeder's suggestion to include ASF virus in the diagnostic
investigations of the syndrome is justified, particularly since the
"High fever disease," according to unofficial sources, has been
observed during the past several months in more than 7 provinces of
China killing more than 20 million pigs, while the official OIE
notification of 9 May 2007 referred to one province (Guandong).
For details on Belgium's ASF outbreak in 1985, see Mod PC's
commentary in posting Classical Swine Fever (CSF) -
Europe 19970219.0406. - Mod.AS].
