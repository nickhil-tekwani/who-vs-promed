[2] Liberia: new site to bury Ebola victims
Date: Thu 29 Dec 2014
Source: Front Page Africa (FPA) [edited]
http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/health-sci/4143-liberia-secures-new-site-to-bury-ebola-virus-victims


The Government of Liberia has secured 50 acres [20.2 ha] of land as the new burial site for all Ebola related deaths. 25 acres of the land have been landscaped and is ready for use. According to an Executive Mansion release, the 25 acres [10.1 ha] of land was secured through the intervention of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in collaboration with the Council of Chiefs and Elders, and the United States based non-governmental organization, Global Community, and the citizens of the Community [where the new burial site is located], in Margibi County. The burial site, which will eventually become the new national cemetery, will enable relatives and loved ones to identify the graves of Ebola victims instead of the earlier format where Ebola victims were cremated.

Speaking to journalists following a tour of the site by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf recently, the Coordinator of the Incidence Management System, Mr Tolbert Nyensuah said areas have been demarcated for Christian burials and Muslim burials; while a place has been earmarked to erect a memorial monument for those victims of the Ebola virus disease [who were] cremated before now. He said the victims will be identified by tombstones and relatives, friends, and even pastors and imams will be allowed to perform burial rites at the site, [without] touching. He said [the importance of] the new burial site is that relatives, loved ones, and clerics can now work with the safe burial teams and victims can have dignified burials. "This will become a national cemetery so that people will not hide dead bodies because of cremation," he stressed... - more

[3] Liberia: 2000 persons quarantined after corpse tested positive for Ebola
Date: Mon 29 Dec 2014
Source: AllAfrica, Liberian Observer report [edited]
http://allafrica.com/stories/201412292655.html


After a corpse transported for burial was confirmed by the County Health Authorities of being Ebola infected, 2000 persons have been quarantined in Lofe Town, Margibi County.

The Margibi health authorities received a call that a body had been transported from Monrovia for burial, according to the Director of Community Health for Margibi County, Mr Joseph J Korhene. He said that the health team and Ebola Task Force, on arriving at the scene on 18 Dec 2014, took a specimen of the corpse that [they] confirmed to be Ebola positive.

Mr Korhene, who spoke to this paper on 23 Dec [2014], said that before the health team arrived in Lofe Town, the family had already finished the wake-keeping, which brought together people from 8 surrounding villages. He said the infected corpse was that of a woman who had died in the Bushrod Island community near Monrovia.

Mr Korhene said that her family knew that she had died of Ebola but had decided to bury her without the involvement of the Ebola Task Force anyway. "...Knowing that the police would arrest them, they dressed the lady up as if she were living and sat her in the car between 2 of her relatives," Mr Korhene disclosed.

He said that the driver who transported the Ebola infected body to Margibi was traced en route. He was arrested and brought back to Lofe town, where he was placed under quarantine with community residents and others who attended the wake of the Ebola victim.

Mr Korhene extended thanks and appreciation to the Red Cross and their partners for their intervention in providing food and some items that were distributed to the quarantined community. He appealed to the Government of Liberia and the National Ebola Task Force to come to the assistance of the health team of Margibi County, which is in need of vehicles and other support to ensure that the spread of the virus is contained.

Kono district [a diamond-rich area], in northeastern Sierra Leone has recently experienced a spike of Ebola cases, with close to 90 bodies being found over recent weeks. As part of its scale-up of activities, the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, with the support of IFRC [International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies] and its Movement partners, had already begun construction of an Ebola treatment centre in Kono. Since the dramatic rise in cases, Red Cross teams have been deployed from neighbouring Kenema and Kailahun districts to conduct assessments, disinfect the hospital and isolate patients, conduct trainings in infection prevention and control, and assist in safe and dignified burials.

[5] Liberia: alert -- 49 new Ebola cases in Grand Cape Mount

http://www.frontpageafricaonline.com/index.php/health-sci/4133-alarm-49-new-ebola-cases-in-cape-mount-travelers-warned


The Incident Management System, an arm of the Liberian government, and partners responsible for the containment of the Ebola virus disease in the country [Liberia] have stated that the disease is growing at an alarming rate in Grand Cape Mount County. Speaking to journalists at the Incident Command Center on [Sun 28 Dec 2014], the head of Liberia's Ebola response, Mr Tolbert Nyenswah said a total of 49 cases have been reported in the area and this hike in the number of cases is due to failure to follow health procedures laid out by the government of Liberia. He said the county now joins Montserrado as the 2 counties with the most Ebola cases.

"In the past 25 days, 1-25 Dec 2014, 49 cases have been reported, 27 confirmed, 9 probable, and 13 cases suspected. He said the disease continues to spread [due to] a high level of complacency on the part of community dwellers in gross disregard for the preventative measures that have been laid out by the Ministry of health. Mr Nyenswah [pointed to] migration of suspected and probable cases within and out of the county, [and] continuous denial by community dwellers that people are dying from Ebola. He said despite such denial the bodies that are being tested turn out to be Ebola positive.

Mr Nyenswah said traditional and cultural practices are still entrenched and people are refusing to stop touching or bathing dead bodies. He said in many cases due to denial, some even hide the sick in their homes [to care] for them and when they eventually die, the family arranges secret burials for their dead relatives.

He said people are no longer washing hands with chlorinated water or [using] sanitizers or other items. He said in the wake of this grave health alert, the government and its partners are holding an emergency meeting in Sinje, Grand Cape Mount County, that coincides with the opening of the 1st Ebola Treatment Unit of 100-bed in Grand Cape Mount County.

He said the government is installing an Ebola lab to test all cases swiftly and [mobilizing] all partners to move into the county to give support. The assistant Minister for Health of Liberia said there has to be drastic behavioral change if the county must reverse its current Ebola numbers... -- more

[6] Guinea: bat-filled tree may have been ground zero for the Ebola epidemic
Date: Tue 30 Dec 2014
Source: Science News [edited]
http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/12/bat-filled-tree-may-have-been-ground-zero-ebola-epidemic


The source of the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa may have been a hollow tree where children played -- and bats roosted. In a visit to Meliandou, the Guinean village where the outbreak apparently started, researchers learned of the tree and linked it to one of the outbreak's 1st victims. But, in a frustrating twist, the tree had burned to a stump just before they arrived, thwarting their search for evidence that might confirm the scenario.

A year ago [December 2013], a toddler in Meliandou died of a mysterious disease; soon, his sister, mother, and grandmother were infected as well. As far as epidemiologists can tell, the family members were the 1st people to die in West Africa's Ebola epidemic, which according to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization has now sickened more than 20 000 people and killed at least 7842. But how the toddler caught the virus has been a puzzle. Before the current outbreak, there was only a single known human case of Ebola in West Africa.

Human Ebola outbreaks elsewhere have been linked to outbreaks in wildlife -- including duikers (small antelope), gorillas, and chimpanzees -- or traced to hunters who butchered animals found dead in the forest. No one knows which animals provide the natural reservoir for Ebola, but bats are leading suspects. Several types of bats can survive experimental infection with the virus, and researchers have found Ebola virus RNA in at least three species of fruit bats. That made the animals -- commonly hunted and eaten in Guinea -- a top contender as the source of the outbreak.

Soon after the outbreak was identified as Ebola in March 2014, wildlife epidemiologist Fabian Leendertz of the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin went to southeastern Guinea to look for signs of an outbreak in wildlife. Leendertz, with 3 more German veterinarians and 8 Guinean biosurvey experts from the nonprofit Wild Chimpanzee Foundation, spent 4 weeks in the region, capturing bats from 4 sites and surveying 2 protected forest areas.

The researchers found no evidence that wild animals were dying of Ebola, they report in a paper published online today [30 Dec 2014] in EMBO Molecular Medicine [AM Saez, S Weiss, K Nowak et al, 2014. Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic; http://embomolmed.embopress.org/content/early/2014/12/29/emmm.201404792.]. The populations of chimpanzees, duikers, and other large mammals were at about the same levels they had been in the previous surveys in the region, conducted in 2010 and 2011 -- "good news for conservation," Leendertz says. They also found no direct evidence of Ebola virus infections in any of the 169 bats (from at least 13 species) that they captured and tested. But their visit to Meliandou yielded intriguing clues.

The researchers found DNA fragments [around the burnt tree stump] that match the Angolan free-tailed bat _Mops condylurus_, an insect-eating species that is widespread across Central and West Africa and that fits the villagers' description. Other studies have found that the species can survive experimental infections with Ebola.

The toddler could have picked up the virus while playing in the tree, Leendertz says; he might have caught and played with an infected bat or ingested a small quantity of infected bat droppings.

Peter Walsh of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, who studies Ebola in wildlife in Central Africa, says the evidence linking the outbreak to the bat tree is frustratingly indirect. "It is suggestive, but it certainly doesn't rise to a 'smoking gun' level," he says. The wildlife surveys were too small to convincingly rule out an outbreak in wild animals, he adds.

Leendertz agrees, but notes that there is little intact forest around Meliandou, which would limit contact with wildlife. And the fact that children and women, rather than hunters, were the 1st people known to be infected also suggests that eating bush meat or contact with forest-dwelling animals is relatively unlikely to have sparked this outbreak. He and his colleagues are continuing to sample bats and other wildlife in the region -- most recently from Ivory Coast, close to the Guinean border. In Guinea, he says, surveys aren't possible at the moment. With the Ebola epidemic still raging there, "people are very suspicious," he says -- especially of anyone who wants to capture bats.

The natural reservoir host of Ebola virus, a zoonosis, has not yet been definitively identified in spite of efforts on the part of numerous investigative teams. This study is intriguing, but more field work must be done to confirm suspicion of this bat as the primary host of the ongoing outbreak. - Mod.LK]

Dr Pierre Rollin, the top Ebola expert at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, describes his efforts alongside other early responders from the World Health Organization [WHO] and Doctors Without Borders [MSF] to control the outbreak in W Africa.

Dr Peter Piot, who helped discover Ebola in 1976, and Jeremy Farrar, a British infectious disease specialist, called the West Africa outbreak "an avoidable crisis" in an editorial published online in September [2012] in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the same issue, WHO officials said of the March to July [2014] period that "modest further intervention efforts at that point could have achieved control."
