Farmers in Ibanda [District, Western Region] are in fear following the outbreak of an unknown disease that attacks the pineapple leaves before killing the entire plant in a matter of weeks. Most of the crops turn yellowish when they reach the yielding time and eventually dry off.

Different chemicals to fight the disease [had no] success. The farmers have reached out to the district agriculture officers but couldn't get a proper diagnosis.

[A number of fungi, bacteria, viruses and other pathogens are known to affect pineapple. The symptoms described above may point towards some form of root rot.

However, in order for management strategies to be able to be designed for the area, it will be vital to determine the cause of the problems, in particular which pathogen(s) may be involved.
