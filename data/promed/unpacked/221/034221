Suspected infections have occurred among persons who received either 80 mg/mL or 40 mg/mL of preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (MPA) produced by the Main Street Family Pharmacy in Newbern, Tennessee. As of 6 Jun 2013, CDC is reporting 24 cases from 4 states -- Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina. The majority of these persons developed skin and soft tissue infections of unclear etiology following intramuscular injection of this product. All products labeled as sterile have been voluntarily recalled by the pharmacy.

State and local health departments are working with facilities to verify the accuracy of the pharmacy's distribution records and to determine which patients may require active outreach. Healthcare providers are contacting patients to determine if they have had possible infections stemming from injections of recalled MPA. Suspected infections that meet the criteria (a person who developed a suspected infection associated with injection of a product, labeled as sterile, that was distributed by the Main Street Family Pharmacy (Newbern, TN) since 1 Dec 2012) are reflected in the case count. Healthcare providers are reminded that any adverse reaction following injection with a recalled product from Main Street Family Pharmacy should be reported to FDA's Medwatch system, which is designed to routinely collect these types of reports.

On 6 Jun 2013, FDA reported detection of microbial contamination, including bacterial and fungal, in unopened vials of preservative-free MPA. Samples are being sent to CDC for further characterization. These findings emphasize the importance for providers to continue to ensure that all recalled products are no longer in use and returned promptly. Clinicians are also reminded that individual containers of compounded or preservative free medicine are intended for single-patient use only; they should not be used as a common source of supply for multiple patients.

CDC is working closely with FDA and the health departments in affected states to monitor and to evaluate this situation. We will provide more information as it becomes available.

[In the almost 2 weeks since the 1st report of this outbreak the number of cases has increased from 7 to 24 and the affected states from 2 to 4. It has not been stated whether the other 23 cases of abscess linked to the steroid injections have yielded any isolates after appropriate culture, other than one where an as yet unidentified fungus was found. Unopened vials of the product have now been reported to have yielded both fungal and bacterial isolates but have not been identified further. - Mod.LL
