Governor says cholera cases in Negros Occidental not alarming
-----------------------------------------------
Governor Joseph Maranon said the reported suspected cholera cases in Negros
Occidental are not alarming, as he advised residents to clean their
surroundings. He said that the report released by the Provincial Health
Office (PHO) on Fri 26 Nov 2004, of about 86 cases in the province,
including Bacolod City, will still be subject to laboratory examination.
The governor added that the report was only advice for residents to check
on their drinking water and to clean their surroundings. "The suspected
cases remain manageable and not alarming," said Maranon.
Records earlier showed that suspected cases of cholera in the province
reached 86, with 3 deaths, from 14 to 20 Nov 2004. Kabankalan City had the
largest number of cases, with 40 in 16 barangays, followed by Bacolod City
with 23, Ilog with 9, Cauayan with 5, Bago City and Himamaylan City with 2
each, and Victorias City and E B Magalona with one each.
Dr Luisa Efren of the PHO ordered the examination of all possible sources
of drinking water and pipes, specifically in Kabankalan. She advised the
city municipal health offices to conduct massive information dissemination
on environmental sanitation, boiling, and chlorination of drinking water
and personal hygiene practices.

Gastroenteritis outbreak in Cebu: 4 dead, 100 hospitalized
----------------------------------------------------------
4 people died, while over 100 were admitted to hospital, in 2 southern Cebu
towns, due to gastroenteritis caused by a contaminated water supply. Two
men, aged 40 and 80 years, both from Barangay Malabagon, Moalboal town,
died last Thu 25 Nov 2004 from acute gastroenteritis. 2 others reportedly
died in Pinamungajan town because of acute infectious diarrhea. 25 more
have been admitted to the town's district hospital since 1 Nov 2004.
In Moalboal, municipal health officer Cesar Mahinay said he had 100
patients in his clinic as of Fri 26 Nov 2004, all complaining of
stomachache and diarrhea. 45 others have been confined at the Badian
District Hospital since Tue 23 Nov 2004. Mahinay said 25 others were
brought to the Barili District Hospital, since the Badian District Hospital
only has 25 beds.
Provincial health officer Cristina Giango confirmed the outbreak of acute
gastroenteritis in Moalboal. She said water samples taken from Moalboal
tested positive for coliforms. But, she said they are still conducting
confirmatory tests to determine the type of bacteria that contaminated the
town's water supply.
Juanito Zuasola, regional epidemiologist of the Department of Health,
corroborated Giango's pronouncement, saying the cases have swelled in just
a short span of time. Zuasola, however, said they only learned about the
outbreak last Fri 25 Nov 2004, because local officials failed to report the
initial cases to them.
But Giango traced the source of the contamination to a leaking pipe of the
Moalboal Water District. A day after the pipes were repaired, on Mon 22 Nov
2004, the 1st case of gastroenteritis was reported, and the ailment
subsequently spread to at least 5 barangays, namely Malabagon, Poblacion
East, Poblacion West, Tamonoy, and Basdacu.

Diarrhea outbreaks strike 3 provinces
-------------------------------------
Thousands of people in South Sulawesi, Central Java, and North Sulawesi
provinces have been treated for diarrhea over the past few months, with
some succumbing to complications resulting from the condition.
In South Sulawesi province, at least 15 people have died of the disease, as
of Mon 22 Nov 2004, at several hospitals. Local government data show that
over 6200 people were treated for diarrhea between 1 and 22 Nov 2004 in the
province.
The deputy chief of the South Sulawesi health office, Muhadir, warned local
residents that the problem could worsen in the next few weeks as the annual
rains began to fall in some parts of the province. Cumulative data has
shown that the number of people treated for diarrhea generally surges
during the rainy season.
In Central Java, cases of diarrhea emerged in several areas 3 months ago,
including Tegal, Solo, and Semarang municipalities. Some 120 people have
been treated monthly at Tegal's Kardinal Hospital, while Solo's Moewardi
Hospital has also treated a similar number of patients every month. In
Semarang, Tugurejo Hospital has treated about 40 people for diarrhea each
month.
"However, we have not yet received any reports on fatalities," said Dr
Krishnajaya, head of the Central Java health office. In North Sulawesi, one
person has died and 150 others have been admitted to hospitals in South
Minahasa regency since last Wed 17 Nov 2004; almost all came from Tareran
district.
Dozens of people were transferred to Bethesda Hospital in the neighboring
city of Tomohon, as South Minahasa hospitals could not accommodate any more
inpatients.

10 children die in diarrhea outbreak in East Java
-------------------------------------------------
At least 10 children died and another 1300 were admitted to hospital after
an acute diarrhea outbreak hit East Java in the last week [3rd week of Nov
2004]. The Health Office in the Central Java province of Khrisnajaya
released a statement saying that more than 600 villages across the province
are vulnerable to the disease. "We are easily becoming prone to the
disease," health officials said, "but we have prepared things to stop it
from spreading".
The worst cases were reported in Makassar and Surabaya, respectively the
provincial capitals of South Sulawesi and East Java. Local heath
authorities said that, in Makassar, more than 2000 diarrhea patients are
suffering from belly aches and vomiting. Other cases have been reported in
Solok, West Sumatra Province: 332 people had to be hospitalized, another 10
died.
Siti Fadillah Supeni, Indonesia's Health Minister, expressed her concern
about delays in treatment that resulted in many patients dying of
dehydration. Cholera might be the cause of the outbreak, possibly being
related to the rush to prepare food for the Idul Fitri celebration that
marked the end of Ramadan, Islam's holy month of fasting.
[Again, cholera may be responsible for some, if not many, of these cases. -

Cholera cases rise in Kano
-------------------------
Cholera cases in Kano rose to nearly 1000 yesterday [Wed 24 Nov 2004] from
642 last week, state health commissioner Sanda Mohammed has said. "A total
of 962 people have been hospitalized at the Infectious Diseases Hospital in
Kano since the outbreak 2 weeks ago, out of which, 47 have died," he said,
one more than the 46 reported on Mon 22 Nov 2004.
He said the disease had now affected 20 local government areas, up from 14
previously, despite measures taken by health authorities to combat it. Last
week [3rd week of Nov 2004], it was reported that 42 people had died when
the deadly waterborne infection erupted in the crowded city. Mohammed said
that, last week, the disease had broken out because Muslim worshippers had
been in a rush to prepare fruit and vegetables for a feast to mark the end
of Ramadan and had not washed them properly.
The disease later spread to neighboring Jigawa State, claiming 4 lives
among 104 cases, senior health official Mustapha Muhammed said. Cholera is
generally contracted from polluted water supplies. It causes vomiting and
severe diarrhea that can result in rapid dehydration and eventual death if
not treated.
