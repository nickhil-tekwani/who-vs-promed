A 6-year-old Indonesian boy died of bird flu at the weekend, bringing
the country's death toll from the disease to 81, officials said on
Mon 9 Jul 2007. The boy, from the city of Cilegon in Banten province,
suffered from high fever and breathing difficulties before he died of
multi-organ failure on Sunday [8 Jul 2007], said Tuty Hendrarwardati,
the spokeswoman of Jakarta's bird flu hospital.
The victim's family and neighbors did not have any chickens in their
backyards, Hendrarwardati said. Joko Suyono from the Health
Ministry's bird flu centre said it was not clear how the boy got the
infection. "We are still investigating how he had contracted the
virus. So far, we only know that he visited the Bandung Zoo," Suyono said.
Bird flu is endemic in bird populations in most parts of Indonesia,
where millions of backyard chickens live in close proximity with
humans. Contact with sick fowl is the most common way for humans to
contract the H5N1 virus.

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Thomas Schmidt (International Institute
for Travel and Health Kaulbachstr. 2530625 Hanover, Germany) for
pointing out that the Xinhua News Agency report of 4 Jul 2007
(reproduced in ProMED-mail as Avian influenza, human (106): Indonesia
20070704.2128) describes, in fact, the same case as that confirmed
earlier by WHO and posted in ProMED-mail on 26 Jun 2007 as part of
Avian influenza, human (103): Egypt, Indonesia, WHO 20070626.2053.)
Consequently, the death of the 6-year-old boy in Banten province
becomes the 81st fatality and the 102nd case in Indonesia. The WHO
cumulative table of confirmed human cases of avian H5N1 influenza has
not been updated beyond 29 Jun 2007, and the number of cases in
Indonesia is given by WHO as 101, of whom 80 have been fatal. The
global total stands at 317 cases and 194 deaths.
