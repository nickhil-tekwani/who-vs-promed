According to a statement by the Regional Health Agency of Corsica, several clusters of urogenital schistosomiasis were detected by national and regional health authorities in late April 2014. The persons concerned did not stay in an endemic area of the disease, and they all swam in the Cavu river, a river in South Corsica.

After these cases were found out, epidemiological, ecological and environmental investigations were initiated by the local and national health authorities. The Directorate General for Health (DGS) asked the High Council of Public Health (HCSP) and the National Agency for Food Safety Environment and Labor (HANDLE ) to assess the risks.

Based on evidence obtained and conclusions of these assessments, an action plan will be implemented by the health authorities before the start of the risk period and the swimming season. It will specify the terms of such screening, diagnosis, prevention, and information to implement. This information will be provided by the health authorities to those concerned. The information was distributed to institutions and health professionals to remind them of the symptoms and treatments of such infection.

Urogenital schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by a worm of the _Schistosoma_ genus. This disease is mostly seen in tropical and subtropical areas. The obligatory intermediate host is a freshwater mollusc, the Bulin, whose presence was recorded in Corsica in the past. This parasitic disease, once diagnosed, can be treated easily.

Jean-Jacques Coiplet, director of the regional health agency explained: "A health risk does not exist, and there is no reason to panic. There is no human transmission [under normal circumstances]. For human transmission, special conditions related to fresh water (swimming, water games etc.) in stagnant waters with little or no current would be necessary."

Cases were reported in Germany and midi-Pyrenees. A team of experts has been on site since Tuesday [13 May 2014] to see how the Bullin (mollusc) will develop. At the same time, an action plan is in progress. The Ministry of Health asked the High Council of Public Health and other national bodies to act before summer arrives when the risks will become more marked.

[It is not known in detail whether _Schistosoma_ was endemic in Europe previously. However, one study found _Schistosoma manosni_ eggs from latrines in France dating back 500 years (Bouchet F et al. First recovery of _Schistosoma mansoni_ eggs from a latrine in Europe (15-16th centuries). J Parasitol. 2002;88:404-5). It cannot, of course, be known whether these eggs came from European or -- as hypothesized in the paper -- African slaves.

Another study hypothesized that "_Schistosoma haematobium_ and _S. mansoni_ have existed since prehistoric times in populations living in or passing through the Sahara. These populations then transported them to countries of Northern Africa, where the specific, intermediary hosts were already present" (Nozais JP. The origin and dispersion of human parasitic diseases in the old world (Africa, Europe and Madagascar). Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2003;98(Suppl 1):13-9).

If the snails allowing the intermediate life stage to develop are present, and the climatic conditions are right, a local transmission can be initiated by persons excreting eggs into the water. Schistosomiasis can exist and transmit down to 7 C [44 F] (see ProMED post "Schistosomiasis - Uganda: (KA) travelers, altitude: 20131123.2070772"). - Mod.EP
