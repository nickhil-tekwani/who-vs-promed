A rescue group says an alarming number of California sea lions are
being found dead or ailing along the central coast near Monterey.
Marine Mammal Center field manager Sue Andrews says the carcasses of
dozens of young sea lions have washed up on area beaches recently.
The center's Moss Landing station has admitted 160 sick sea lions to
its main rehabilitation facility in Sausalito this year [2010]
compared to 143 last year [2009].

Andrews says one possible cause is a food shortage created by warmer
sea waters. Monterey Bay Aquarium spokesman Jim Covel says another is
what appears to be an unusual number of births in the chilly local
waters. he says sea lions usually give birth farther south, but that
many expectant mothers may have gone north to seek food.

[While the number of sick sea lions has increased about 12 percent
over the same period of time, we are not told of other possible causes
such as disease, domoic acid, red tide, or any other issues that could
be a causative factor. A scarcity of food is a significant event,
especially since it prompts births in colder waters. This may lead to
other serious losses. - Mod.TG]
