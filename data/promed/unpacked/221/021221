The Health Department says a potentially fatal mosquitoborne disease has been found in East Kimberley chicken flocks. Murray Valley encephalitis [virus], which is spread to humans via infected mosquitoes, can cause serious brain swelling and even death.

A series of tests on the department's sentinel chickens has identified several cases in Wyndham and Kununurra.

Acting medical entomologist Peter Neville says residents need not panic but should take precautions. "Primarily, try to avoid outdoor exposure around dawn and dusk, wearing protective clothing, including long-sleeved clothing, outdoors and also applying a personal repellent," he said.

[Last year (2011), 11 people in Western Australia had Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) virus infections, one of whom died. There were cases in several areas of the state that year. Since there is no commercially available vaccine for MVE virus, the only preventive measure is to heed Peter Neville's timely warning to avoid mosquito bites. Since sentinel chicken flocks have become positive for MVE virus infection, it is clear that the virus is being actively transmitted in the areas mentioned.
