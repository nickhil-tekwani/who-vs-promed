Duck eggs and duck products have been implicated in a national
outbreak of salmonellosis which, the Health Protection Agency [HPA]
says, has led to the hospitalization of 2 people and the death of
one. The outbreak involves _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Typhimurium DT8, a strain, which is often associated with ducks.

According to the HPA, there have been 63 reports of human infection
in England and Northern Ireland in 2010, compared with 47 in 2009 and
34 in 2008.

"As soon as we first noticed an increase we started detailed
investigations, interviewing cases to find the common cause of
illness and to identify the source of the outbreak," said the HPA's
Dilys Morgan. "It became clear from our investigations that the
increase was related to the consumption of duck products, mainly eggs."

A spokeswoman for the HPA said there had been an acceleration in the
number of salmonella cases over the summer months, "something we had
not seen before", with the greatest concentration in the south-east
and north-west of the country. She added that the cases related to
commercial flocks of ducks, not backyard flocks.

The Food Standards Agency has subsequently issued a statement
reminding consumers and caterers of the importance of good hygiene
when handling and preparing duck eggs. "Duck eggs may occasionally be
contaminated with salmonella, both on their shells or, more rarely,
internally," it said. "Duck eggs should be cooked thoroughly until
both the white and yolk are solid."
