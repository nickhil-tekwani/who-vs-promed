In New South Wales, Australia, cryptosporidiosis became reportable by labs
in December 1996. Since then, a handful of cases (~3) were reported each
month until November 1997. From late November to February 23, 169 [159?
cases were reported, including 48 with onset in December, 74 in January and
so far 37 in February. 53% were female, and mean age was 4 years. Cases
were spread widely across the state. In recent weeks, Canberra, Australia
(located within the Australian Capital Territory, within NSW) experienced a
swimming pool related outbreak of cryptosporidiosis.
Extensive interviews with the NSW cases about exposures (travel,
commercial products or drinking water, animals, child care etc) during the
2 weeks before onset identified no common risks, although 51% reported
contact with other people with diarrhoea, and 61% reported swimming (but at
a variety of different pools and beaches across the state).
While the case increase over summer could represent seasonal
patterns, we have issued several warnings about the increase in cases, the
ease of person-to-person spread, and the ease with which swimming pools can
be contaminated; and recommending that persons with diarrhoea practice good
hand washing, and stay out of child care, and avoid entering swimming pools
until completely recovered. Investigations continue.
