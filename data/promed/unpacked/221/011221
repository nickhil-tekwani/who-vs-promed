The USDA's annual livestock report for 1997 on Egypt carried the following
information:
"In 1996, Egyptian exports to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States (the major
export markets) were banned due to the presence of Rift Valley Fever in
Egypt. The ban on exports will remain through 1997." The source for USDA
was the Global Economic Data Exchange System.
The US Consular Information Sheet dated October 1997 on travel in Egypt
carried the following advisory:
"The risk of exposure to Rift Valley Fever (RVF) exists throughout Egypt.
RVF is a disease of domestic animals that can infect humans and which
flares up in parts of the country from time to time. Preventive measures
include avoiding freshly slaughtered meat and _known areas of
infestation_." [The advisory did not specify the "known areas of
infestation." - DP

We have heard that sporadic cases of what might be a phlebovirus infection
have been seen over the past weeks in Egypt. Such infections could be due
to a sandfly fever virus, to Rift Valley fever virus, or to another
phlebovirus [family Bunyaviridae, genus _Phlebovirus_. In view of the
1993-94 Egyptian epidemic of RVF, which caused abortions in livestock, and
visual damage and even fatalities in humans, it seems important to
determine the clinical signs and symptoms, the causative agent, and the
extent of the outbreak which, if it is RVF, is unseasonable.
If anyone has any information on the current situation, we would like to
share it with the list.
