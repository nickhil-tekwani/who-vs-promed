On 28 Nov 2006, a patient in Norway was diagnosed with _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infection. He contacted the district
food safety office in Trondheim as he suspected the source to be
Spanish-produced cured sausages he had bought on a ferry between
Kiel, Germany and Oslo, Norway in October 2006. A sample was taken
from an opened package of sausage from the patient's home, which
proved to be positive for _S._ Typhimurium. Since the product was not
on sale in Norway, it was not possible to sample unopened packages.
Isolates from the patient and the sausage were phage-typed to be
DT208 and had nearly identical Multiple Locus Variable Number Tandem
Repeat Analysis (MLVA) profiles (one locus difference). The isolates
were resistant to tetracyclines, otherwise sensitive to all tested
antimicrobials.
Since November 2006, surveillance data has identified 3 other
patients infected with _S._ Typhimurium with the same phage type and
MLVA-pattern as found in the sausage. Two of them had reported
traveling on the same ferry between Germany and Norway before falling
ill. For the last case, information about travel is not available.
The patients all came from different parts of Norway.
This MLVA-profile had not been previously detected, and was unique
among the 956 different MLVA-profiles of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium
recorded in the international database at the Norwegian Institute of
Public Health.
Outbreak in Denmark
On 4 Jan 2007, an alert was sent from the Norwegian Rapid Alert
System for Food and Feed (RASFF) contact point to Denmark (the main
importer and redistributors of the product) and Spain (the producing
country). This alert resulted in a recall of the product from the
Danish market the same day. Late in January 2007, an enquiry was sent
to Enter-net (the international surveillance network for the enteric
infections Salmonella and VTEC O157
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>
asking whether other countries had observed cases or products with
the same characteristics.
Denmark's Statens Serum Institut responded to the enquiry that it had
received 6 _S._ Typhimurium isolates of the same MLVA pattern between
25 Nov and 27 Dec 2006. This was also the 1st time that this
particular MLVA pattern had been found in Denmark. Five of the 6
patients were children between 3 and 10 years of age, while the other
patient was an adult. Follow-up interviews of the patients or their
parents showed that 5 patients had eaten sausage bought in a
supermarket chain to which the recalled sausage was distributed.
Although only 2 patients could recall the sausage as being Spanish
chorizo-like sausage, all patients' reports were compatible with
exposure to a spiced specialty sausage. The 6th patient ate a sausage
bought in a specialty store that purchased sausages from the same
import company that sold the sausage to the supermarket chain; a
later investigation of the outbreak did not exclude the possibility
that a part of the infected batch was sold to this store.
The MLVA method
MLVA fingerprinting of _S._ Typhimurium strains is based on capillary
separation of multiplexed PCR products of tandem repeats loci,
Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeats (VNTRs) in the bacterial genome
(1,2). The resulting MLVA-patterns are recorded as character values
representing different allele sizes. In contrast to pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE) -- the current gold standard for typing many
bacterial pathogens -- in MLVA, there is no need for DNA
purification, restriction enzyme digestion or gel electrophoresis.
MLVA is therefore easily implemented and produces data that may be
shared rapidly by email as numeric values when using the same
equipment to detect fragments.
In Denmark and Norway, MLVA-typing has been included in the routine
surveillance of _S._ Typhimurium, using the same harmonized method
(3-5). Several outbreaks have been detected and confirmed, in which
MLVA proved to be superior to PFGE for both surveillance and outbreak
investigation. The outbreak reported here gives further credit to
MLVA as a powerful subtyping tool and demonstrates the ease with
which the typing data may be exchanged and compared between countries.

MLVA proved to be superior to PFGE for both surveillance and outbreak
investigation. MLVA-typing is also developed for a range of other
pathogens (1,2), including some foodborne such as _Listeria_,
pathogenic _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ (6,7). The outbreak
reported here gives further credit to MLVA as a powerful subtyping
tool and demonstrates the ease with which the typing data may be
exchanged and compared between countries.
Conclusion
Based on the available information and considering the small size of
the outbreak, it is likely that it was caused by one single
contaminated batch of sausages. However, since MLVA typing has not
been implemented throughout Europe, it is impossible to determine the
exact magnitude of the outbreak. The authors therefore suggest that
public health laboratories and food authorities continue to monitor this issue.
