Abstract
A cluster of 56 patients returning from Gambia with falciparum
malaria has been noted in several countries of the European Union
since September this year [2008]. TropNetEurop, the European Network
on Imported Infectious Disease Surveillance, collected and reported
the cases. Lack of awareness and, consequently, of prophylactic
measures against malaria were apparent in the majority of patients.

The vast majority of all tourists stay in the coastal resort area, so
it is fully expected that most of the European tourists who recently
were reported to have returned with malaria in the Eurosurveillance
articles would have stayed there. We know that malaria transmission
persists in this area, and there have been cases this year [2008]
among local people and expatriate residents. Of course, the important
thing to emphasize is that there is no part of The Gambia that is
malaria free, and the recommendation for chemoprophylaxis for
visitors should be reinforced.

The MRC, NMCP, and NGO partners (CIAM) are analyzing 2008 data from a
number of health centres, including those previously analysed and
reported for the period until the end of 2007 in the recent Lancet
article. Malaria in most health facilities appears to be continuing
to decline, particularly upcountry in places where the decline had
previously been less marked than at the coast.

Community based surveys have also recently shown lower prevalences
than ever seen previously; these are being written up with a
manuscript hopefully available in January 2009, which we would be
glad to get your comment on. We have noticed in at least one facility
in the coastal region that numbers of cases are higher in 2008 than
in the previous 2 years, so it seems that the distribution is now
more patchy spatially, and we need to be alert to the possibility of
very local resurgences.

If you and the other European investigators could get details on the
hotel names and dates of stay for each case, we could help
investigate whether there was a micro-focus of "high" transmission or
not. We would not need further details of itineraries, such as day
trips, as nearly all transmission of malaria here occurs at night.

We now have 3 patients from Sweden at Karolinska Hospital/Solna and
Huddinge. We are investigating the details of the hotel and locality
involved.

Age / Gender / Hospital of malaria diagnosis / Date of return to
Sweden / Date trip started / Malaria prophylaxis

59 / M / Karolinska-Solna / 18 Nov 2008 / 11 Nov 2008 / No
35 / M / Karolinska-Huddinge / 27 Nov 2008 / 15 Nov 2008 / No
48 / M / Karolinska-Solna / 10 Dec 2008 / 8 Dec 2008 / No

We have had 2 more Finnish tourists with falciparum malaria from
Gambia in December 2008 after writing the Eurosurveillance articles;
the same story: no appropriate prophylaxis.

We know of a cluster of 3 imported malaria cases (one fatal case) in
a group of returning travelers from the Gambia seen at a secondary
hospital in Madrid. None was on prophylaxis.

[ProMED thanks Tomas Jelinek from TropNetEurop for permission to
publish the additional cases from Sweden, Finland and Spain, bringing
the total number of reported cases to 64 with 3 fatalities. None of
the new cases took malaria prophylaxis.

The comment from Dr David Conway that the distribution of malaria in
The Gambia is patchy makes detailed investigation of the movements in
The Gambia of the patients and mapping of the hotels where they
stayed important. However, The Gambia is known as a malaria endemic
destination, and the fact that very few had been recommended malaria
chemoprophylaxis by the travel agent who sold the travel highlight
that this situation can only be prevented in the future by travel
agents taking responsibility for information on health issues at the
destination.
