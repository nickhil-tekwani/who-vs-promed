HFMD Epidemic Spreading in Malaysia, Declining in Singapore
-----------------------------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR: A viral disease [Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease - HFMD that is
mostly attacking children spread to new areas on Friday, killing a
3-year-old boy in the Malaysian capital and terrifying some parents into
keeping their children away from kindergartens. The death in Kuala Lumpur's
University Malaya Medical Centre on Thursday brought to 3 the number of
children killed by the hand, foot and mouth disease that appeared to have
spread from Singapore to the southern Malaysian state of Johor and then to
other northern areas. As fears of a wider epidemic spread, some schools in
Kuala Lumpur canceled scheduled swimming events. But there was no directive
from the government to prevent large gatherings of children to avoid
contagion. Many worried parents on Friday kept their children from nurseries
and a federal health official said an emergency centre had been created to
monitor spread of the disease. Schools or kindergartens could be ordered
shut if the outbreak persisted, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
One death was reported in Johor and the other in the northern state of
Kedah. The New Straits Times newspaper, which reported the latest death, did
not identify the victim, but said he was the son of a Pakistani expatriate.
Health authorities in Johor ordered all kindergartens and nursery schools to
close on Wednesday for at least 2 weeks. One day later, they declared that
the disease had reached an alarming level with the number of suspected hand,
foot and mouth cases at 137. Seventeen new cases were admitted to hospitals
on Wednesday, The Star daily said.
As of Thursday, 1725 cases of the viral disease had been reported in
Singapore and 9 children were in hospital. But the outbreak appeared to be
declining in Singapore, where 4 children had been killed by the virus that
spreads through contamination with infected body fluids. The city state,
which is separated from Johor by a thin strip of water, announced late
Thursday it was reopening its kindergartens and pre-schools next week.
Wading pools and public playing areas in shopping centres and fast-food
areas would remain closed until further notice.
The symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease include fever, sore throat and
blistering rashes on the hands and feet. The disease can be spread through
direct contact with nasal discharge, saliva, faeces and fluid from the
blisters. The disease is not usually life-threatening but can sometimes
involve potentially fatal complications such as meningitis, encephalitis and
inflammation of the heart muscles. More than 50 children died in Taiwan
during an outbreak in 1998 and another 30 were killed in the eastern
Malaysian state of Sarawak on Borneo island in 1997.

More Children Admitted to Hospital with HFMD in Malaysia
--------------------------------------------------------
A total of 24 children, suspected to be suffering from hand, foot and mouth
disease (HFMD), have been admitted to hospitals throughout the state of
Johor, bringing to 256 the total admitted since 1 Sep 2000. Pontian Hospital
recorded the highest number of admissions with 7 cases, followed by the
Sultanah Aminah Hospital with 6 and 4 in Batu Pahat. Kluang and Kota Tinggi
hospitals had 2 admissions each while Tangkak and Kulai both registered one
on Monday, while 26 patients were discharged. State Family
Development, Women Affairs and Health Committee chairman Halimah Mohd
Sadique said Health Department officers had already conducted visits to the
427 nurseries and daycare centres to check on cleanliness. Halimah said the
state had so far distributed about 20 000 leaflets to nurseries, day-care
centres, kindergartens and primary schools to educate care providers and
parents.
In Alor Star, State Deputy Health Director Dr Meera Koai said 3 more cases
of HFMD had been reported in Kedah, bringing the total to 8. The 3 cases
were registered in the past 48 hours. She said the 8 victims, aged between
one and 5 years, were still confined at the respective hospitals in Sungai
Petani (4 cases), Alor Star (3) and Yan (one). Dr Meera said medical teams
had been deployed to interview the victims' parents to ascertain which
kindergarten or child-care centre their children attended.
In Seremban, 5 new cases of HFMD were reported in Negri Sembilan yesterday,
raising the total in the state to 38. Mentri Besar Tan Sri Mohamed Isa Abdul
Samad said 2 patients were admitted to the hospital here, while 3 were
admitted to the Kuala Pilah district hospital.
In Klang, Selangor Health Department deputy director S. Sinnaia said an
average of 5 cases involving children below the age of 5 were reported
weekly in the state. He said statistics indicated there was a rise in the
cases reported but it was due to the general awareness among parents who
bring their children to hospitals and clinics for slight fever or some rash.
He added there were now 23 cases, including 18 cases admitted for observation.
