First report of Faba bean necrotic yellows virus (FBNYV) infecting
chickpea (_Cicer arietinum_ L.) and faba bean (_Vicia faba_ L.) crops
in Sudan
K.M. Makkouk <K.Makkouk@cgiar.org> (Virology Laboratory, Germplasm
Program, ICARDA, PO Box 5466, Aleppo, Syria); A.A. Hamed (Hudeiba
Research Station, P.O. Box 31, Ed-Damer, Sudan); M. Hussein (Shambat
Research Station, P.O. Box 30, Khartoum North, Sudan) and S.G. Kumari
(as for Makkouk). Accepted for publication 18 Oct 2002.
45 samples of faba bean (_Vicia faba_ L.) and 130 samples of chickpea
(_Cicer arietinum_ L.) were collected from plants with symptoms
suggestive of a viral infection (leaf rolling, yellowing, and
stunting) during the period 1999-2001 at the Shambat and Hudeiba
Research Stations in Sudan.
Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were used in a tissue-blot immunoassay
(Makkouk & Comeau, 1994) at the Virology Laboratory of ICARDA in
Syria to detect specific viruses in the family Luteoviridae: ATCC
PVAS-647 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) to test for Beet western yellows
polerovirus (BWYV); and ATCC PVAS-650 to test for Soybean dwarf
(SbDV) and 4B10 to test for Bean leaf roll virus (BLRV), 2 unassigned
viruses in the family (Katul, 1992).
Other MAbs (3-2E9 and 2-5H9) were used to test for Faba bean necrotic
yellows nanovirus (FBNYV, genus Nanovirus, family Nanoviridae); the
latter MAb is FBNYV-specific (Franz et al., 1996). A polyclonal
antiserum (provided by H.J. Vetten, BBA, Braunschweig, Germany) was
used to test for Chickpea chlorotic dwarf virus (CpCDV) a tentative
species in the genus Mastrevirus, family Geminiviridae).
CpCDV (leafhopper-transmitted) was detected in 77.0 percent of
chickpea and 15.5 percent of faba bean samples tested, and the
aphid-transmitted FBNYV was found in 95.5 percent of faba bean and
6.2 percent of chickpea samples tested. FBNYV has been reported to
infect food legumes in many countries in West Asia and North Africa,
and reaches epidemic levels in some countries, including Egypt
(Makkouk et al., 1994). Only 2 chickpea samples tested positive for
BWYV, but SbDV and BLRV were not detected in any samples.
Based on the reaction with the FBNYV-specific MAb 2-5H9 and the
characteristic symptoms expressed by infected faba bean and chickpea,
this is the first record of FBNYV affecting these crops in Sudan.

[Cultivated faba bean is used as human food in developing countries
and as animal feed, mainly for pigs, horses, poultry, and pigeons in
industrialized countries. It can be used as a vegetable, either green
or dried, fresh or canned. It is a common breakfast food in the
Middle East, Mediterranean region, China, and Ethiopia (Bond et al.,
1985). Faba bean is one of the most important winter crops for human
consumption in the Middle East. Straw from faba bean harvest commands
a premium in Egypt and Sudan and is considered a cash crop (Bond et
al., 1985). The straw can also be used for brick-making and as a fuel
in parts of Sudan and Ethiopia.
Chickpea is an important food crop in Asia, the Middle East, and
North Africa as well as Southern and Eastern Africa, Europe, the
Americas, and Australia. The small-seeded desi types, which account
for about 85 percent of world production, are grown in the Indian
subcontinent, Ethiopia, Australia, Mexico, Afghanistan, and Iran.
