The Scotts Bluff County Health Department has been notified of a significant increase in positive tularemia cases in the county and eastern Wyoming over the past couple weeks. According to their press release, tularemia, also known as rabbit fever or deer fly fever, is a bacterial disease associated with various animal species. It frequently affects rabbits, hares and rodents and has been associated with rabbit and rodent die-offs.

Humans can be infected with the bacteria through many different sources including through the bite of an infected insect, usually a tick or deerfly, handling infected animal carcasses, consuming contaminated food or water, or by inhalation of the bacteria. Tularemia is treatable with appropriate antimicrobials.

Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after exposure and can include a sudden high fever, headaches, swollen lymph nodes, muscle and joint pain and a sore or lesion at the site where the bacteria entered the body.

To avoid exposure to tularemia, the Scotts Bluff County Health Department encourages people to avoid handling sick or dead animals, wear rubber gloves when skinning or handling animals, cook meat thoroughly, use protective clothing and insect repellents to avoid deer-fly and tick bites, avoid untreated drinking water, and use DEET or other tick repellents during tick season.

[Although not apparently related to bioterrorism in this case, tularemia is a category A bioterrorism agent, and the pneumonic form is likely to be the one associated with intentional spread.

Tularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a small, non-motile, Gram negative intracellular coccobacillus. It can be found in a variety of animal hosts, notably lagomorphs (rabbits and hares), aquatic rodents (muskrats, beavers, and water voles), other rodents (water and wood rats and mice), squirrels, and cats. In the United States an outbreak involving commercially distributed prairie dogs occurred in 2002.

_F. tularensis_ can be recovered from contaminated water, soil, and vegetation as it can persist for weeks under ideal environmental conditions. _F. tularensis_ also can be found in amoebas (such as, _Acanthamoeba_), which can become airborne in some settings, and may represent a significant environmental reservoir for this bacterium.

Humans can become incidentally infected through diverse environmental exposures: bites by infected ticks and deerflies; contact with infectious animal tissues or fluids; direct contact with or ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; and inhalation of infective aerosols. In one case, bacteria were aerosolized from the fur of a dog as it shook itself off after entering a home. Finally, there are several reports of tularemia in humans following bites from infected domestic cats. It is highly infectious, with as few as 10 organisms needed to cause disease. Humans can develop severe and sometimes fatal illness but do not transmit the disease to others. The typical incubation period is 3-5 days, with a range of 1-14 days. - Mod.LL
