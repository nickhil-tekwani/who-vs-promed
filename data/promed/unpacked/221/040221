The parents of 3 young children from North Sumatra's Karo regency who were
earlier reported as exhibiting classic bird flu symptoms plan to sue the
provincial administration and the central government for saying their
children most likely had bird flu.
The plan was disclosed on Friday [4 Aug 2006] when the parents along with
the director of the Legal Aid Institute for Health met Karo Regency
Legislative Council members. Institute director Iskandar Sitorus said the
lawsuit, which is being prepared and is expected to be completed in 3
weeks, would target health minister Siti Fadilah Supari and president
Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The lawsuit will be filed at Central Jakarta
District Court. He said they were also considering suing the World Health
Organization (WHO), the provincial administration, and doctors who treated
his clients' children.
The 3 children, 2 sisters and the son of a neighbor from Sumbul village in
Kabanjahe, were referred to Adam Malik Hospital in Medan on Tuesday after
being treated at Kabanjahe Hospital in Karo. Karo is the site of a cluster
of 8 bird flu fatalities in one family who died in May, the world's largest
single cluster.
But on Thursday, the health minister said that preliminary tests on their
blood samples were negative. However, she warned that the results were
tentative because they were tested when they were showing symptoms of bird
flu, including fever and respiratory difficulties. A 2nd test was being
carried out to confirm the results. "The health minister should be
responsible for her statement that the 3 are suspected of having bird flu
and then that they tested negative. These statements have made the families
of the victims outcasts," he [Iskandar Sitorus] told The Jakarta Post after
the meeting.
Iskandar said it seemed like the central government was not serious in
dealing with bird flu, especially in Karo, as seen by the way it named
people who it suspected had bird flu. "If the government keeps doing this,
it will cause chaos. It simply corrected the statement. This is related to
people's lives so the government should be more careful," he said. The
families, he said, have demanded that the government make a public apology
and compensate them. But he could not provide details of the compensation
demanded. The father of the 2 girls said since the government announced
that his children were possible bird flu patients, his family had been
shunned by neighbors.
