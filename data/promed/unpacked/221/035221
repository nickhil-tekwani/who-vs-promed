[3] Cholera - Angola (European Response)

The European Commission has allocated a further
1.5 million in Angolan currency in emergency
humanitarian aid to fight the increasing
incidence of cholera in Angola. More than 36 000
cases have been reported since the first outbreak
on 13 Feb 2006. Of Angola's 18 provinces, 11 are
now affected, including the capital Luanda. More
than 1300 people have died and, according to
UNICEF, 35 percent of the victims are children
under 5. This new aid comes on top of an initial
emergency grant of the same amount announced by
the Commission on 21 Apr 2006. At that stage, the
Commission already envisaged the possibility of
mobilizing extra resources, should the need arise.
Epidemiologists now expect as many as 30 000 new
cases over the coming 2 to 3 months. Due to the
rapid spread of the disease, relief agencies and
international bodies like WHO have continued to
scale up their operations. The Commission's
contribution is a vital part of this
international effort.

A 2nd cholera outbreak in Guruve in Zimbabwe has
killed 3 more people and infected 26 others,
bringing the cumulative death toll since the
first outbreak in the district 2 weeks ago to 15.
To date, Guruve has recorded a total of 56 cases,
forcing health officials to reconsider their
strategy. The cholera reportedly spread from as
far as Mushumbi Pools in Dande communal lands,
Matsvitsi in Chipuriro communal lands and Guruve
Centre. In an interview yesterday, the Deputy
Minister of Health and Child Welfare, Dr Edwin
Muguti, said 15 of the reported cases had
resulted in fatalities and that his ministry had
since deployed health officials to the affected
areas to assist in combating the outbreak.
Mashonaland Central provincial medical director
Dr Clemence Tshuma said health officials in the
area were on active surveillance to detect and
curb the further spread of the often fatal
disease. Cholera also broke out recently in
Kariba and Chiredzi. Members of the public have
been urged to drink clean water and those who
fetch water from unprotected sources should boil
it to make it safe. Urban dwellers have been
warned against consuming water from burst pipes
as it is often polluted.

More than 500 people have died in a cholera
outbreak in southern Sudan, where 2/3 of the
population drink unclean water, the WHO said Tue,
23 May 2006.
Southern Sudan's towns are overflowing as
hundreds of thousands of people return home after
a peace deal signed in 2005 to end more than 2
decades of civil war. With crowded, unsanitary
conditions, diseases such as cholera and
meningitis are spreading fast.
An outbreak of acute watery diarrhea began in
late Jan 2006, and the first cases of cholera
were confirmed in Feb 2006. Since then, it has
spread to 6 of the 10 southern states.
As of 5 May 2006, there were 516 deaths and 13
852 cases of acute watery diarrhea, WHO said in a
statement Tue, 23 May 2006. It was unclear how
many of those cases tested positive for cholera.
UN agencies are distributing jerrycans, chlorine
and soap to try to prevent the spread of the
outbreak.

Outbreaks of diarrhea, cholera and other diseases
due to the scorching heat of midsummer are
causing a huge rush of patients to different
hospitals in the capital. International Centre
for Diarrhoeal Disease and Research, Bangladesh
(ICDDR,B), Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH),
Mitford and Dhaka Shishu Hospital have been
facing the influx of patients suffering from
these diseases.
Dr Mohammad Shahadat Hossain of ICDDRB told The
Daily Star that though an average of 180-220
patients usually get admitted to the hospital
daily for different waterborne diseases all the
year round, the number increases sharply during
the period of March-May and August-September. On
average, around 450 patients are now hospitalized
daily for diarrheal diseases, he added. Most of
them are children and day-labourers, who work in
the sun.
