During the past week, 3 suspected bird flu patients have died in
North Sumatra, with the latest victim passing away in a Medan
hospital Wednesday morning.
According to the North Sumatra Bird Flu Prevention Team, the 3
victims, all from Kubu Simbelang village in Karo regency, died
several days after being admitted to hospitals in Medan.
The team said 3 other suspected bird flu patients are currently being
treated at Adam Malik Hospital in Medan.
Nur Rasyid Lubis, the head of North Sumatra's Suspected Bird Flu
Patient Management team, said Wednesday the 3 dead victims had eaten
chicken together.
Several days after eating the chicken, "the first, a 29-year-old man,
suspected victim experienced breathing problems and a high fever. The
same symptoms were also suffered by the 2 other victims, an
18-year-old and a 40-year-old,", Nur said.
[The first man] died at Adam Malik Hospital on Wednesday morning,
while the 2nd died at the same hospital Tuesday. This 2nd victim's
father, the 3rd man, passed away 4 May 2006 at Elisabeth Hospital.
Nur, who is also deputy director of medical services at Adam Malik,
said the hospital did everything in its power to treat the patients,
but was unable to save them.
North Sumatra Health Office chief Fatni Sulani said the office was
investigating the cases and had sent blood samples from the 3 to
Jakarta for testing.
"We expect the results of the blood tests to be completed in the next
2 weeks. For the meantime, the 3 victims are still suspected, not
positive, bird flu patients," Fatni said.
She said that North Sumatra has not had a confirmed case of bird flu in humans.
"So far, the bird flu virus in North Sumatra has only affected fowl.
After the virus was found in local birds, 13 regencies/cities have
been put on bird flu alert," Fatni said. She said the cities on bird
flu alert included Binjai, Deli Serdang, Langkat and Medan.
North Sumatra Husbandry Office head Rahim Siregar said Wednesday his
office had added Karo regency to the list of bird flu-prone areas in
the province.
"Fowl in North Sumatra have been affected by bird flu since July
2005, but there have been no confirmed cases in humans," Rahim said.

[Indonesia has continued to have cases of influenza A H5N1, some in
clusters, and these cases are likely to be confirmed. As in earlier
clusters, the likelihood is that these cases share a common exposure
rather than representing person-to-person transmission. Map showing
the location of Medan in North Sumatra:

Further information including virologic confirmation and genetic
testing of the viruses is awaited. - Mod.LM]

Djibouti said on Thursday that one person had tested positive for the
deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus in the first confirmed human case
in the Horn of Africa.
"One patient and 3 domestic chickens have been detected with the H5N1
virus," Health Minister Abdallah Abdillahi Miguil said in remarks
broadcast on state television.
The U.N. World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva confirmed the human case.
"There is a 2-year-old girl who has been infected with H5N1. She is
alive," WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said.
The tiny country of 300 000 at the mouth of the Red Sea is along the
path of migratory birds who have been detected with the deadly strain.
The condition of the girl, who the minister said was still in
hospital, was not immediately known.
The results were tested in conjunction with the WHO at a laboratory
in Egypt, the minister said.
Miguil said that a team of scientists and doctors was meeting to plan
how to contain an outbreak and find out more about how the girl
contracted the disease.
"Investigations are to be made soon in the area where the patient is
living and elsewhere," he said.
The country has also banned the importation of chickens from other
nations, he said.
On the streets of the former French colony's capital, Djibouti,
people were worried.
"(Chicken) is my preferred dish, but now it's the choice between life
or death," street vendor Saada Ahmed said.

The World Health Organization said Thursday that a baby in Djibouti
has contracted the H5N1 virus, the country's first human case of bird
flu.
"I believe the person is still alive. It's a 2-year-old girl," WHO
spokesman Dick Thompson told The Associated Press in Geneva. He said
the girl was confirmed as H5N1-positive by the U.S. Naval Medical
Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) in Cairo, but could not provide any further
details.
The Djibouti government confirmed the human case in the capital and
said 3 chickens also had been infected with the virus.
"Djibouti thus becomes the first country in the Horn of Africa to
have detected a human case and bird cases of H5N1," the government
said on the official Djiboutian Information Agency web site.
It was not clear from the government statement whether the case of
the chickens was related to the human case.
It also did not provide any details on the health of the girl, saying
only that she was tested after showing flu symptoms on 27 Apr 2006.
The Health Ministry said the infection occurred despite a heightened
alert, but that the government would further increase surveillance of
the disease. It told citizens to keep away from any birds showing
symptoms of sickness.
Djibouti is now the 10th country where a person has been infected
with the deadly virus. At least 207 people have contracted the
disease globally and 115 have died over the last 3 years, according
to the U.N. health agency. Virtually all the individuals were exposed
to the disease in poultry.
As of 27 Apr 2006, there had been no reports of H5N1 in poultry or
wild fowl in Djibouti, according to the Paris-based World
Organization for Animal Health.
Health experts fear the bird flu virus could mutate into a form
easily spread among people, potentially sparking a pandemic.
