More than 80 per cent of the 986 horses potentially exposed to the venereal
disease contagious equine metritis have been officially cleared.

United States authorities, in their latest report to the World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE), said this week that 823 of the 986 horses involved
have completed their entire testing and treatment protocol and are negative
for the disease.

That represents 83.5 per cent of the 986 horses that investigations across
nearly all US states revealed had been potentially exposed to the disease,
caused by the bacterium _Taylorella equigenitalis_. More than 90 per cent
of the mares, 645 in total, at the centre of the investigation have been
cleared, 4 of which had originally tested positive for the disease. A total
of 178 stallions, 163 exposed and 15 formerly positive, have now completed
their entire testing and treatment protocol. Another 48 exposed stallions
have had at least one set of negative cultures prior to test breeding.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) said investigations continued to be
conducted by individual state agriculture departments. "The epidemiological
investigation is tracing all shipments of semen from the affected
stallions, all horses which visited the affected index premises since the
arrival of the positive stallions, and all epidemiologically linked horses
to any positive horse." It said all exposed horses that have been located
are currently under quarantine or hold order until determined as negative
for the disease.

Three of the 8 states that have had positive horses -- Georgia, Indiana,
and Kentucky -- have now completed testing and treatment protocols for all
known positive and exposed horses and are currently considered free of the
disease. The operation began in mid-December [2008] when Kentucky confirmed
that a quarter horse stallion on a central Kentucky farm was positive for
the disease. A total of 21 stallions, including one that is now a gelding,
subsequently returned positive tests for the bacteria as the investigation
spread across 48 states. Hawaii and Rhode Island are the only states in
which an exposed or positive horse has not been found [I do not recall
reports of Alaska having any positive horses. - Mod.TG].

"None of the positive horses have yet been identified as the source of the
outbreak; the epidemiologic investigation continues to pursue all available
information relative to determining the origin of this outbreak, but no
conclusions can yet be drawn," the USDA said.

The 21 positive stallions were found in 7 states: one in Georgia, 3 in
Illinois, 3 in Indiana, one in Iowa, 4 in Kentucky, one in Texas, and 8 in
Wisconsin. The 5 positive mares were found in 3 states: 2 in California, 2
in Illinois, and one in Wisconsin.

Contagious equine metritis can cause a vaginal discharge in up to 40 per
cent of affected mares, abortion and infertility. Stallions typically show
no clinical signs. Stallions and mares can become chronic carriers and be
sources of infection for future outbreaks. The transmission rate is high
and naturally occurs by mating, but contaminated instruments and equipment
may be an indirect source of infecting mares and stallions. The bacteria
can also be spread via semen collected for artificial insemination. It can
be treated with disinfectants and antibiotics.

[Progress has been a little slower than authorities would have wished. This
has been a relatively frustrating epidemiological investigation as the
source has not been located.
