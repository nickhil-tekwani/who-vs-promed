Avon, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire Health Protection unit has
received 5 reports of acute Q fever with onset dates between the end
of May and 14 Jun 2007. All 5 confirmed cases are residents of the
town of Cheltenham (Gloucestershire), population 109 800. There had
been no cases reported in Gloucestershire since 2002. The cases
reported in Cheltenham did not have any occupational risk factors.
Although all 5 cases reported possible environmental risk factors, no
common exposures have been identified so far.
Q fever (caused by _Coxiella burnetti_) is thought to account for
approximately one percent of community acquired pneumonia in the UK
each year and can result in serious complications such as
endocarditis. The main reservoir is sheep and other animals that can
shed massive numbers in placental tissues. The main reservoirs are
sheep, goats and cattle. Transmission of Q fever occurs primarily
through inhalation of contaminated aerosols. The organism is robust
and can survive in dust and animal litter for many weeks and in dried
blood for at least 6 months at room temperature. The most infectious
animal materials are the fluids of birth and afterbirth, followed by
blood, milk, urine and feces. Such infectious materials can be
derived from livestock as above or from domestic animals,
particularly parturient cats.
Although Q fever is rare in the UK, it is more common in the
southwest of England and Northern Ireland, probably because of higher
exposure to animal sources. The Health Protection Unit would be
grateful for information on any cases of Q fever who have visited
Gloucestershire during the incubation period (2 to 3 weeks, depending
on the infective dose). Please contact the Consultant Regional
Epidemiologist, Isabel Oliver <Isabel.oliver@hpa.rg.uk>.

Cheltenham is well known for being the home of the flagship race of
British steeplechase horseracing. More information is needed to
assess how these individuals acquired this airborne infection, which
can spread over at least 1/2 mile. - Mod.LL]
