RE IMPORTED RABIES--
At our corporation, I instituted routine pre-exposure immunization with
Human Diploid
Cell Rabies Vaccine(Connaught/Pasteur) for all our expatriate families
moving to Thailand as a precaution. Shortly after moving there one of our
officer's children was bitten by a stray dog and received post-exposure
treatment with vaccine and human
immune globulin. As the incubation period for rabies can range from a few
days to 20 years, globalization and more international travel require
careful attention to this matter. Also, I have had several discussions on
this with Prof. Henry Wilde in Bangkok, whose clinic is the most active I
have seen.
Immunization may be expensive, especially in the USA, but the alternative
risk is unacceptable. Corporations sending expatriate families into
rabies-endemic areas should provide this service to the entire family, along
with focused education on the need for immediate post-exposure treatment,
regardless of previous pre-exposure immunization.
