According to information from the Health SEREMI [las Secretarias
Regionales Ministeriales de Salud; Regional Ministerial Secretariat]
official Claudio Vallejos, the Public Health Institute has confirmed
the 1st hantavirus [infection] cases in the region so far this year
[2011], referring to a 26 year old man who is gradually recuperating
in the Coyhaique Hospital and his 3 year old daughter who has not had
any further complications.

The Health SEREMI reported that, thanks to timely epidemiological
work carried out in the land of the Guadal area by professionals of
this institution, one can be assured that it is very likely that the
infection was acquired in a home located in the La Lomita area of
Guadal. Thus, the neighbors, and the rural population in general, must
constantly assume safe behavior when taking on activities in the
countryside.

The man was admitted this past 1 Mar [2011] to the intensive care
unit of the Regional Hospital, where he was connected to a mechanical
respirator because of severe respiratory insufficiency and acute
pulmonary edema. Following up on this case, samples were taken from
his wife and daughter. The daughter developed respiratory symptoms and
fever on 13 Feb [2011] and received hospital treatment in the Cochrane
locality on 18 Feb [2011]. Both are out of danger.

[Curiously, no mention is made of the 1 Mar 2011 report of a new
possible case of [a] hantavirus infection in a student of about 20
years of age from Osorno, who was admitted to the Cochrane Hospital
with a clinical picture consistent with a hantavirus cardiopulmonary
syndrome. He was later sent to the Coyhaique Regional Hospital, the
same one to which the above 26 year old man was admitted (see
ProMED-mail archive number 20110304.0715).

Perhaps the etiology of the student's illness has not been confirmed.
Or perhaps these refer to the same case, now confirmed, although the
Health SEREMI stated that the student could be the 2nd case of
hantavirus infection so far this summer season.

As is usual, the specific hantavirus involved with suspected or
confirmed cases of hantavirus infection in Chile is not indicated. The
virus most likely to be responsible for the above case is Andes virus,
with the long-tailed pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.
