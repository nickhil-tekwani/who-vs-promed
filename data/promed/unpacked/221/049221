Hendra Virus Infects Australian Veterinarian
----------------------------------------------------
A Thoroughbred veterinarian infected by the killer Hendra virus was
admitted to a hospital in Queensland 27 Aug 2007. The vet contracted
the virus after performing an autopsy on a Thoroughbred in his clinic
last week.
There are reportedly 2 known current cases of Hendra in the
Thoroughbred population in Queensland.
While believed unrelated to the equine influenza (EI) currently
sweeping Australia, an outbreak of Hendra virus has even greater
personal ramifications for humans. Whereas EI cannot kill humans,
Hendra can and has -- trainer Vic Rail was killed by Hendra in 1991.
In June 2006, the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) urged horse
owners in southeast Queensland to keep feed and water under cover and
to stable horses overnight where possible, following the
identification of Hendra virus in a horse on the Sunshine Coast.
An AVA spokesperson at the time said the disease is not highly
contagious, and that the public health risk from the disease is
limited to those who have exposure to [infected] horses' body fluids.
They noted the disease is rare and sporadic. However, the disease can
be transmitted to humans.
Hendra virus causes symptoms of respiratory illness in horses,
including respiratory distress, frothy nasal discharge, and elevated
body temperature and heart rate. Horse owners are urged to stable
horses at night and to call a veterinarian as soon as possible if
they symptoms appear.
It is believed fruit bats are the natural host of the virus, formerly
known as equine morbillivirus. The virus can be lethal when
transmitted to humans and horses.

Hendra first appeared as a deadly horse and human pathogen in 1994 --
see ProMED archive below. The reservoir is thought to be fruit bats
of the genus _Pteropus_., which also carry the related and frequently
fatal Nipah virus to pigs and through them to humans in East
Asia. Nipah virus is thought to be transmitted tby the bats
competing with the pigs for ripe fruit such as mango that has fallen
into open pig pens. The pigs develop a strong cough that transmits
the virus from them to the farm hands who feed them.
Has anyone seen fruit bats feeding in horse troughs, or sharing water
troughs with horses, in Australia? - Mod.JW]
