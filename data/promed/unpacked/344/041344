Racing club on alert for disease
--------------------------------
An outbreak of a potentially fatal horse disease in Hawke's Bay is
unlikely to affect the running of the Hawke's Bay Racing Club's spring
festival -- although officials are monitoring it closely.

"We take these things seriously, are always vigilant and have strict
protocols in place," club chief executive Jason Fleming said today [3
Sep 2009]. "I am quite confident in the procedures."

An outbreak of the equine bacterial disease "strangles" was detected
on a property in the Hastings area in the past week.

"The vets are dealing with it and have isolated it to one property,"
Mr Fleming said.

Highly infectious strangles is spread by direct contact between
horses. It is not an airborne-transmitted virus. The initial symptoms
include high fever, lethargy and a loss of appetite.

Veterinary Services senior veterinarian Richard Lee said about a 5th
of horses affected by strangles could go on to develop complications
including pneumonia, airway obstruction and abscesses in the
intestinal tracts. It could be fatal, especially in young horses. Mr
Lee said vaccination courses were available. He urged "strict
isolation" of horses and said no new horses should be allowed on
properties until the outbreak was dealt with. "Maintenance of strict
biosecurity of horses is by far the most effective way to prevent this
disease," he said.

It is understood the 7 infected horses arrived in the region from
Waikato and were confined to one property.

"They have not been down to the track," Mr Fleming said. He was
satisfied with the isolation steps put in place. The racing fraternity
had been made aware of the outbreak, and equally made aware it had
been contained and was being monitored, he said.

Mr Lee said no other cases had been identified at this stage, which
indicated the outbreak had "thus far" been successfully contained.

The Hawke's Bay Racing Club's spring carnival continues on 19 Sep
2009, with the feature Gold Trail Stakes race, and on 3 Oct 2009 when
the 150th Hawke's Bay Guineas will be staged.

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae
characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses,
donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated-hemolytic
Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary
pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious, and produces high morbidity and
low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via
fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals
are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and
initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease.
Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on
temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme
heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid
secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the
organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn
facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated
for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of
infection is fever (103-106 deg F [39.4-41.1 deg C]). Within 24-48
hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical
of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge,
depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with
retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty
swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal
pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with
residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the
disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic
strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscesses in other
lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the abdomen and, less
frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed
with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days
until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]
can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve
appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately
prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia,
prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss of appetite].
Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (= up
to 24 hr after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation.
The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount
a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to
infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is
indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection,
twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and
brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread
the disease to other horses.
