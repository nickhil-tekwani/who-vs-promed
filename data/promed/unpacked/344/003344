Kern County [California] has seen a dramatic increase in the number of babies born with syphilis over the last 3 years [2013-2016]. For decades, cases of congenital syphilis in the county have been fairly low or nonexistent. It is a problem that has county health officials stressing the importance of prevention, detection and treatment.

Congenital syphilis can be deadly, and if the baby survives they can deal with lifelong issues. "There can be blindness, there can be deafness, long bone deformities," said Denise Smith, director of disease control for Kern County. "There can be some serious problems with the baby."

Last year [2015] in Kern County, 28 babies were diagnosed with congenital syphilis.
6 of them died. The recent spike in the sexually transmitted disease has not been traced back to anything specific.

In 2014, 1.6 percent of women in California were diagnosed with syphilis per 100 000 population [?]. Eighteen percent of men were [?]. The same year in Kern County, cases were reported in 10 percent of women per 100 000 population and 24 percent of men [?]. [See the moderator comments section for the correct data.]

"The crazy thing about syphilis is that you can not have any symptoms at all," said Smith. This becomes a problem because once those initial symptoms clear up, the bacteria can still be passed along to the baby.

In an effort to combat the ongoing issue, the Kern County Public Health Department put on an enhanced surveillance process last year to try to treat pregnant women early enough to prevent the spread to their babies. "We're actually following and sending nurses out to the homes of every female that's been diagnosed with syphilis and especially the pregnant females," said Smith. "We had actually 58 moms that delivered this past year, and 30 of those were prevented before they delivered."

The main thing Smith said they are trying to stress is the importance of prenatal care. "When you go in for your 1st prenatal visit you get all the blood work done," she said. "One of those tests is a syphilis test." The goal of that is to detect the disease in pregnant women so they can be treated at least one month before the baby is born. Smith said getting the diagnosed women to receive full treatment is one of the biggest challenges. "They have to come back for 3 different shots, 7 days apart," she said.

Other Central Valley communities are also seeing the increase in syphilis cases, according to Smith.

[The correct data for primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis in the U.S. state of California and Kern County, California, in 2014 is as follows:

In 2014 California reported 3808 cases of P&S syphilis and the incidence rate was 9.9 per 100 000 population: There were 310 cases in women, which represented 8.1 percent of the total cases of P&S syphilis, and the incidence rate in women was 1.6 per 100 000 population; there were 3496 cases in men, which represented 91.8 percent of the total cases, and the incidence rate in men was 18.3 per 100 000 population (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/STD-Data-LHJ-StateSummary.pdf).

The data for Kern County, California, in 2014 was 141 cases of P&S syphilis and the incidence rate was 16.2 per 100 000 population: There were 37 cases in women, which represented 26.2 percent of the total cases of P&S syphilis, and the incidence rate in women was 8.8 per 100 000 population; there were 104 cases in men, which represented 73.8 percent of the total cases, and the incidence rate in men was 23.0 per 100 000 population (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/STD-Data-LHJ-Kern.pdf).

According to the CDC, after reaching an all time low in 2000, cases of P&S (infectious) syphilis are on the rise in the United States, particularly among men having sex with men. New cases of P&S syphilis in men having sex with men are often characterized by co-infection with HIV. The incidence rate for P&S syphilis in Kern County, California, rose dramatically from 3.0 in 2010 to 16.2 per 100 000 in 2014.

Syphilis can be passed from mother to infant during pregnancy, causing congenital syphilis. Pregnant women with untreated early syphilis experience perinatal death in up to 40 percent of cases. Cases of congenital syphilis in California jumped from 30 in 2012 to 100 in 2014 (http://kvpr.org/post/fresno-kern-counties-have-highest-rates-babies-born-syphilis-california). Fresno and Kern Counties have the highest rates of babies born with syphilis in the state. In 2014, both counties saw an increase of over 300 percent. Health leaders were said to be not sure what's triggering the spike; they say it may be linked to poverty, substance abuse and lack of access to health care (http://kvpr.org/post/fresno-kern-counties-have-highest-rates-babies-born-syphilis-california).
