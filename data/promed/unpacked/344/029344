NEW SALMONELLA STRAIN POSES MAJOR FOOD RISK
DENVER Colo. -- According to this story, _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT104,
which has been found in Canada, the United States, Denmark, Britain,
Germany, France and Austria, could edge out _E. coli_ 0157:H7 as the next
dangerous contaminant in food.
The greatest problem with this bacteria is that it is resistant to common
antibiotics like ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides
and tetracycline.
The story says that Canada reported it in 1970. It was detected in the
United Kingdom in 1984 with 259 human cases. In 1996, the British reported
4,006 cases.
It is more commonly found in dairy herds than beef herds. Mortality among
cattle was reported at 40 to 60 percent, hitting calves the hardest. The
story adds that the bacteria has been found in feces of birds, pigs, sheep,
horses, emu, cats, dogs, mice, coyotes and squirrels.
People probably came in contact with the bacteria from animal products like
beef, pork, poultry or unpasteurized dairy products.
Don Lein, of Cornell University, was quoted as saying, "We'll see a
paradigm shift in antibiotics in food animals. It's pretty hard to say we
will live without antibiotics in our food industry and what catastrophic
events it could lead to."

[This is a typical newspaper report of a possible new emerging danger,
obvious with sensation and short on facts & background. Would any of our
members who are salmonella-savvy care to provide a balanced and rounded
appreciation of why this _Salmonella_ strain has "emerged" and the risks it
may present. - Mod.MHJ ......................................mhj/es
