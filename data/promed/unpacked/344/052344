- 15 Mar 2019. DRC Ebola total rises by 4 as survey shows high vaccine acceptance
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/03/drc-ebola-total-rises-4-survey-shows-high-vaccine-acceptance

Lab tests have confirmed Ebola infections in 4 more people from 4 different locations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the country's health ministry said today [15 Mar 2019]. In other developments, a new survey conducted among residents of the DRC's Ebola-hit region found that the vaccine was well tolerated and had high acceptability.

4 new cases, 4 more deaths
--------------------------
The 4 new cases are in Mandima, Katwa, Butembo, and Kayina. Also, 240 suspected illnesses are under investigation. The new cases push the outbreak total to 936 cases, which includes 871 confirmed and 65 probable infections.

Four more people died from their infections, including 2 in community settings in Mandima and Butembo, an occurrence known to raise the transmission risk. Two of the deaths occurred in Ebola treatment centers, one in Mabalako and one in Beni.

Since the outbreak began, 591 people have died from Ebola.

Some vaccine resistance noted
-----------------------------
In the vaccine survey, researchers from the DRC and Canada administered a 34-item questionnaire to a convenience sample of 96 people in Mangina, where the outbreak began, and Butembo. They reported their findings on 13 Mar 2019 in Vaccine. The study included 90 people who received the VSV-EBOV vaccine and 96 controls who weren't eligible to be vaccinated.

The survey took place from 7-10 Sep 2018. The questions, modeled after earlier studies in Ebola outbreak countries, asked people about their perceptions of the disease and their impressions of response efforts, such as vaccination and safe burials. Regarding the vaccine component, respondents were asked about side effects and whether they would recommend immunization to a friend or family member.

Side effects were reported by 83% of vaccine recipients, but only 5 (7%) reported joint pain and 4 (5%) reported rash. The researchers noted that although side effects were commonly reported, the rate they saw in the survey was lower than that of an earlier clinical study involving healthy volunteers.

Of the people vaccinated, 84% were classified as "promoters", meaning they would recommend it to others. And of the unvaccinated controls, 72% said they'd want to be vaccinated if supply was available. Of both groups combined, 82% said the vaccine was acceptable for family members.

When they looked at people who had negative attitudes about the vaccine, researchers found an association between lower Ebola knowledge, resistance toward Ebola control measures, and negative vaccine attitudes among some people who hadn't received the vaccine. "This finding may signal the presence of a significant sub-group of people in Eastern DRC demonstrating social resistance to EVD control efforts that require special attention, consistent with numerous media reports," the investigators wrote.

Community mistrust has been a feature of past Ebola outbreaks and, along with insecurity, has been a steep challenge in the current outbreak. In a related development, the Paul G Allen Family Foundation recently announced an Ebola response accelerator challenge to identify innovative solutions to address both insecurity and community mistrust.

The challenge closes on 25 Mar 2019, and the group expects to review proposals and make decisions in early April 2019.

[2] Summary

Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo: Disease outbreak news: Update 14 Mar - Fri 15 Mar 2019
[WHO: Disease Outbreak News]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/14-march-2019-ebola-drc/en/

The public health response to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak continues to make gains. During the last 21 days (20 Feb-12 Mar 2019), no new cases have been detected in 10 of the 20 health zones that have been affected during the outbreak (figure 1: see URL above for figures and tables). There have also been fewer new cases observed over the past 5 weeks compared to January 2019 and earlier in the outbreak (figure 2).

Currently, the greatest concern centres on the neighbouring urban areas of Katwa and Butembo, which continue to contribute about 3/4ths of recent cases. Clusters in other areas of North Kivu and Ituri provinces have been linked to chains of transmission in Katwa and Butembo and have thus far been contained to limited local transmissions with relatively small numbers of cases. A total of 74 confirmed cases were reported during the last 21 days from 32 of the 125 health areas affected to date (table 1). Risk of further chains of transmission and spread remains high, as highlighted by the recent spread to Lubero Health Zone, and reintroduction to Biena Health Zone following a prolonged period without new cases.

Response teams are fully operational in all outbreak affected areas, and there are encouraging improvements in community acceptance of the response, despite the challenges of ongoing insecurity caused by armed groups. Seven field laboratories have remained fully operational, sustaining similar testing rates as previous weeks. During the past week, 1213 samples from new suspected cases, community deaths and previously confirmed cases were tested within 48 hours. Outreach teams made up mostly of local volunteers also met with 6000 households during the past week, building local knowledge of Ebola, and referring sick individuals to either Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) or other health facilities as appropriate. In the last 2 weeks, community dialogues were held in several villages in Katwa and Vuhovi to find ways in engaging community members to build trust and ownership in the Ebola response.

Efforts to strengthen case finding and investigation and contact tracing activities are also bearing fruit. Of 74 confirmed cases reported in the last 21 days, 83% (62 cases) have been epidemiologically linked to active chains of transmission; either listed as contacts at illness onset (47 cases) or linked retrospectively to other cases or health centres where they were likely exposed (15 cases). Investigations are ongoing to identify links for the remaining cases.

Challenges include further attacks by armed groups on affected communities and ETCs, elements of community mistrust, and persistent delays in getting people into care in ETCs for various reasons. The ETC in Butembo has been rebuilt following 2 attacks and is treating patients again, and the Katwa Transit Centre remains operational.

Cumulatively, cases have been reported from 125 of 319 health areas across 20 health zones of North Kivu and Ituri provinces (table 1). Overall, 584 deaths (case fatality ratio 63%) have been reported, and 308 patients have been discharged from ETCs.

[3] Control effort
- Fri 15 Mar 2019. CDC's Redfield: It could take another year to control Ebola in DRC [STAT, abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/15/redfield-projection-ebola-drc/ [byline: Helen Branswell]


Controlling the difficult and dangerous Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may take another year or more, Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Fri [15 Mar 2019]. That projection is bleaker than one issued Thu 14 Mar 2019 by the director-general of WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said he hoped the epidemic could be stopped within the next 6 months.

But Redfield, who traveled to the Congo with the WHO director-general last week, said it would be a mistake not to plan for a more prolonged outbreak, given the evident complexity of stopping transmission of the virus in north eastern DRC. "We cannot underestimate this outbreak. We need a long-term strategy," Redfield told STAT. "I would love to see this outbreak end in 6 months, like my friend Tedros continues to hope for. But I think the reality, the practical reality, is this is going to be a longer road. And we need to start planning for it," he said.

That could prove challenging from a funding point of view. WHO and other United Nations agencies involved in the outbreak are already struggling to raise the money needed to finance the response through July of this year [2019]. Agencies and nongovernmental organizations working to stop the virus have estimated their efforts will cost USD 148 million but have only been able to raise about 60 per cent of that amount, Tedros said.

The epidemic, which may date back to late April of last year [2018], was only recognized as an Ebola outbreak in late July 2018. Redfield said he and the WHO director-general visited the outbreak zone to recalibrate the response. More efforts, he said, must be placed on gaining the community's trust so that they will engage with outbreak response teams. "We have not effectively engaged the community as a part of the response. Figuring out how to do that is critical," Redfield said. So is improving the skill sets of the people working on the response, a task CDC will contribute to, Redfield said. Redfield said CDC currently has 3 people in Goma, a major city south of the outbreak zone where the outbreak response is being relocated. He said he hopes to get clearance to expand the CDC's presence there, if the security situation allows for it.

- Sat 16 Mar 2019. North Kivu: training of the 2nd Rapid Response Team against Ebola virus disease
[Digital Congo, online translation; abridged, edited]
https://digitalcongo.net/article/5c8cce43e7d83b000442dd62/

By the beginning of the week, Christophe Ndibeshe Byernero launched the training of the 29th Ebola Rapid Ebola Response Team at the Pallotine Missionary Center in Goma, North Kivu. Ndibeshe praised the support of WHO in building a multi-disciplinary team ready to be quickly deployed to any new outbreak of Ebola.

Forty health professionals made up of epidemiologists, laboratory technicians, psychiatrists, security specialists and experts in communication and social mobilization benefited from this training of the 29th Rapid Response Team against Ebola Virus Disease.

http://radiomotofm.info/lirearticle.php?billet=5553

Persistence of Ebola virus disease in Butembo. The movement fights for change; LUCHA [Lutte pour le Changement; movement for change] breaks its silence. This citizen movement thinks that this responsibility is divided between population, government, CENI [Commission Électorale Nationale Indépendante; Independent National Electoral Commission] and the response team.
