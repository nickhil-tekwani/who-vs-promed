--------------------------------------------------------------------
Amphibians are among the most threatened animal groups. Population declines and extinctions have been linked, in part, to emerging infectious diseases. One such emerging disease has been attributed to Perkinsea-like protists causing mass mortality events in the United States. Using molecular methods, we evaluated the diversity of Perkinsea parasites in livers sampled from a wide taxonomic collection of tadpoles from 6 countries across 3 continents. We discovered a previously unidentified phylogenetically distinct infectious agent of tadpole livers present in a broad range of frogs from both tropical and temperate sites and across all sampled continents. These data demonstrate the high prevalence and global distribution of this infectious protist.

The decline of amphibian populations, particularly frogs, is often cited as an example in support of the claim that Earth is undergoing its 6th mass extinction event. Amphibians seem to be particularly sensitive to emerging diseases (such as, fungal and viral pathogens), yet the diversity and geographic distribution of infectious agents are only starting to be investigated. Recent work has linked a previously undescribed protist with mass-mortality events in the United States, in which infected frog tadpoles have an abnormally enlarged yellowish liver filled with protist cells of a presumed parasite. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this infectious agent was affiliated with the Perkinsea: a parasitic group within the alveolates exemplified by _Perkinsus_ sp., a "marine" protist responsible for mass-mortality events in commercial shellfish populations. Using small subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing, we developed a targeted PCR protocol for preferentially sampling a clade of the Perkinsea. We tested this protocol on freshwater environmental DNA, revealing a wide diversity of Perkinsea lineages in these environments. Then, we used the same protocol to test for Perkinsea-like lineages in livers of 182 tadpoles from multiple families of frogs. We identified a distinct Perkinsea clade, encompassing a low level of SSU rDNA variation different from the lineage previously associated with tadpole mass-mortality events. Members of this clade were present in 38 tadpoles sampled from 14 distinct genera/phylogroups, from 5 countries across 3 continents. These data provide, to our knowledge, the 1st evidence that Perkinsea-like protists infect tadpoles across a wide taxonomic range of frogs in tropical and temperate environments, including oceanic islands.

This study adds to the notion that potential the global amphibian crisis might result from increased susceptibility of frogs to infections due to a disrupted stress-host-parasite interaction. Worldwide amphibian decline has been related to infection with a fungal pathogen (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_) (1). However, evidence indicates that this pathogen is neither a necessary nor a sufficient cause of the on-going declines. The presence of the fungus does not always lead to frog mortality, and in declining populations where the fungus is absent, other macro- and micro-parasites were found at high prevalences (2), as it is the case for these _Perkinsus_-like pathogens. It has also been reported that global warming can degrade toads' condition (3), that toads with less body mass (a sign of weakness) were more likely to die from _B. dendrobatidis_ infection (4), and that frog population crashes due to _B. dendrobatidis_ were preceded by periods of increasing stress (as evidenced by increasing limb asymmetry) (5). 2 recent independent studies found new strong evidence of the link between the stress response and _B. dendrobatidis_ infection. Glucocorticoid release rates were higher in wild populations of 2 frog species infected with _B. dendrobatidis_ than in uninfected populations (6). And an experiment conducted with another frog species under laboratory conditions compared _B. dendrobatidis_ infected frogs with and without clinical sings of disease and found that diseased frogs had elevated baseline glucocorticoid levels and poorer body condition than those with subclinical infections (7). Thus, as has previously been suggested (8, 9), the underlying cause of these declines might be a disrupted stress-host-parasite interaction due to anthropogenic stressors (that is, global climate change, pollutants, land use change, etc).
