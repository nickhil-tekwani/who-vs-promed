New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Silkeborg, West [North Jutland]
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jun 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 3 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Samples were collected on [24 Jun 2020], and _Taylorella equigenitalis_ was detected on [30 Jun 2020] in the 3 stallions. Official restrictions were imposed on the stallions on [30 Jun 2020]. No clinical signs observed. The stallions are subsequently subject for antimicrobial treatment.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 100 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Official restrictions have been imposed on the stallions. The official restrictions include antimicrobial treatment. The stallions must subsequently be tested negative for _T. equigenitalis_.

Control measures
Measures applied: Traceability, quarantine, vaccination permitted (if vaccine exists), treatment of affected animals (antimicrobial treatment)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Statens Serum Institut (national laboratory) / Equidae / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 30 Jun 2020 / Positive

[The event summary and map of the previous contagious equine metritis (CEM) event, which occurred in December 2019, can be seen at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=32688. That event was declared resolved on 20 Feb 2020. The current outbreak is located in the same geographic area of the previous case.

"Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is a highly communicable venereal disease of horses, caused by the bacterium _Taylorella equigenitalis_. This disease can spread widely from a single asymptomatic carrier, particularly a stallion. Infected horses do not become systemically ill or die, but reproductive success is reduced. Additional economic impacts include the cost of pre-breeding tests and treatment in endemic areas, as well as screening before importation into CEM-free countries. Excluding _T. equigenitalis_ from a country can be challenging. Control programs have significantly reduced the incidence of this disease in Thoroughbreds, which were severely affected by outbreaks in the 1970s; however, it also occurs in other breeds, and identifying carriers can be difficult. _T. equigenitalis_ is fastidious and can be difficult to culture, and serological tests are useful only in mares and for short periods.

The geographic distribution of _T. equigenitalis_ is difficult to estimate accurately. This organism has been detected at times in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia and on some islands. In some countries, it may be absent or rare in some breeds of horses (e.g., Thoroughbreds) due to control programs, but present in others. Some nations reported to have eradicated contagious equine metritis include certain European countries, the U.S., Canada, Australia and Japan. There is no evidence that _T. equigenitalis_ infects humans" (Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. 2015. Contagious Equine Metritis.
