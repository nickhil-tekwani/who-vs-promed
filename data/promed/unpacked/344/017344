A young 28-year-old veterinarian was transferred in serious condition to Santiago, after arriving at the Osorno Base Hospital from the Puerto Octay Hospital with respiratory distress. The patient tested negative for coronavirus and hantavirus, but she is suspected of having Q fever. Through social networks, the case of the veterinarian, who worked in the Manuka dairy company in Puerto Octay, was made known. The woman's relatives urgently requested blood donors after she was diagnosed as suspected of Q fever.

Q fever is an infection caused by the bacteria _Coxiella burnetii_. It is transmitted from animals to humans and in its deadliest form can damage vital organs.

The director of the Hospital Base San Jose, Hans Hesse, referred to the clinical condition of the patient. This person was transferred by a team specialized in ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation] -- a rare machine in Chile -- and respiratory support for high-severity patients, to the Las Condes clinic. Meanwhile, the Regional Ministerial Secretary of Health, Alejandro Caroca, assured that they are continuing the diagnostic work. The authority added that if the presence of the bacteria is confirmed, they will take the necessary actions.

In 2017 the alarms were turned on and investigations were initiated that confirmed the presence of the bacteria in the vicinity of the Manuka dairy company. This occurred after workers presented the symptoms of the disease, which can generate serious effects on the health of those affected.

[Severe pneumonia in acute Q fever may occur. ProMED awaits more information about this case and how it relates to the dairy company.

Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with metabolically dormant and spore-like compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.
