Arabica coffee disease on the rise
----------------------------------
Coffee berry disease and leaf rust, which often affect arabica coffee, are
on the increase, the National Crops Resources Research Institute has said.
Africano Kangire disclosed that the diseases are affecting yields and need
urgent attention. In Uganda, arabica constitutes 20 per cent and robusta 80
per cent of the coffee crop.

"The coffee industry is faced with challenges including the intensification
of research in pests and diseases management and global warming resulting
in drought in some areas," Kangire said. He observed that resources are
inadequate and the Government is not seriously investing in coffee research.

[2] Swollen shoot, cocoa - Ghana: control attempts

Cocoa farmers refuse to destroy disease infected farms
------------------------------------------------------
Most cocoa farmers in the Central Region whose farms have been infected
with the swollen shoot disease are refusing to allow the trees to be cut
down for fear of losing their farms to the land owners. When the land
becomes vacant, those who wish to re-crop have to enter into new
negotiations which, in most cases, do not go in favour of the farmer.
Therefore farmers prefer to continue to enjoy the little harvest from their
[diseased] trees.

Samuel Ankomah, Central Regional Cocoa Extension Officer, expressed dismay
about the refusal of the farmers to allow the destruction of their infected
cocoa farms for replanting. He said the situation could have adverse
effects on cocoa production in the country. He said the government had
earmarked money to be paid to farmers whose diseased cocoa trees were cut
down; free hybrid seedlings would also be supplied and technical advice
offered by extension workers. The Ghana Cocoa Board had nursed more than
1000 hybrid cocoa seedlings to be supplied to the affected farmers for
replanting.

[3] Swollen shoot, cocoa - Ivory Coast: spread

Disease to cut Ivorian cocoa harvest by 2 per cent
--------------------------------------------------
Cocoa output from the world's top grower, Ivory Coast, will slip 1.9 per
cent during the 2009-10 season due to the effects of swollen shoot disease,
the West African nation's representative to the International Cocoa
Organisation, Saint-Cyr Djikalou, said.

He said the country's cocoa production has been falling in the past few
years mainly due to an attack by the swollen shoot disease, and some
farmers are switching to growing rubber to diversify their sources of
income. Ivory Coast cocoa output during the 2008-09 season reached just
over 1.22 million tonnes, the lowest output in at least 5 years. The
2009-10 crop would likely come in at 1.2 million tonnes, and output during
the 2010-11 crop could fall even further.

"The government and research partners have intensified efforts to contain
the spread of the disease and we are still waiting for the results," he
said. "But the way things are now, our output could drop to anything
between 1 and 1.1 tonnes next year [2010-11]."

[Coffee
-------
The 2 commercially grown coffee species are _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or
highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee).

Coffee berry disease (CBD; also called green berry anthracnose) is caused
by the fungus _Colletotrichum kahawae_. CBD occurs only in Africa and
affects arabica coffee only with losses of up to 80 per cent. The pathogen
affects flowers, immature coffee berries, and sometimes the beans. Infected
berries display dark sunken spots coalescing into lesions. Berry
development may be arrested resulting in mummified berries on branches.
Infected berries are considered the major source of inoculum, and spores
are spread mainly by wind-blown rain or drops from tree tops. Disease
management includes cultural practices, quarantine, and periodic fungicide
treatments. Some resistant host cultivars exist, and more are being
developed. _C. coffeanum_ causes a similar disease in South America.

Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus
_Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. It also
affects only arabica varieties and has destroyed plantings in many
countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on
the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata; it rarely occurs
on stems or fruit. Spores are spread by wind and rain. Disease management
relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season.
Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer
quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it
particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

Robusta varieties in Uganda are affected by coffee wilt disease (CWD, also
called tracheomycosis) caused by the fungus _Gibberella xylarioides_ (see
ProMED-mail post 20090514.1807).

Cocoa
-----
Swollen shoot disease of cocoa is caused by _Cacao swollen shoot virus_
(CSSV; genus _Badnavirus_) and can lead to severe crop losses. CSSV is
thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees.
Symptoms vary with different viral strains from severe effects on shoots
and roots to no symptoms at all. The virus is spread by several species of
mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and
mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean plant material. Most
affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their
neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and native forests serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant
crop varieties have been initiated.

In Ghana, a westward spread of CSSV led to a serious outbreak in 2008 (see
ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) with the possibility of the involvement of
a new viral strain. In 2008, Cote d'Ivoire launched a 2-year project to
fight swollen shoot (see ProMED-mail post 20080302.0860) including
replanting and rejuvenation programmes. However, doubts have been cast on
the CSSV resistance levels (at least under field conditions) of the new
hybrid varieties.
