Hepatitis A outbreaks in the EU/EEA mostly affecting MSM - 2016/2017
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Epidemiological summary
From June 2016 and as of 28 Apr 2017, 674 confirmed cases have been reported as associated with these outbreaks. Of the 665 cases whose gender is known 531 (95 per cent) are males; of the 622 of these whose age is known, 558 (90 per cent) are between 18 and 50 years of age. The majority of the cases whose sexual orientation is known (n=353, 83 per cent) are men who have sex with men [MSM].

Event 1 [cluster VRD_521_2016]: 336 cases are associated with this cluster, which was 1st reported by the UK in December 2016. 43 cases (20 per cent) of those whose travel history is known travelled abroad during the incubation period; of these, 35 travelled in different EU countries; 18 travelled to Spain.

Event 2 [cluster RIVM-HAV16-090]: 268 cases are associated with this cluster, which was initially reported through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) on 14 Oct 2016 by the Netherlands. Later, the same event was reported through EPIS-FWD on 31 Jan 2017. The 1st 2 Dutch cases reported visiting the EuroPride festival in Amsterdam between 23 Jul and 7 Aug 2016. As of 28 Apr 2017, 63 cases (29 per cent) of those with a travel history available travelled abroad during the incubation period: of these, 49 travelled in different EU countries; 27 travelled to Spain, and 5 to Germany.

Event 3 [cluster V16-25801]: 70 cases are associated with this cluster, which was reported through EPIS-FWD on 11 Jan 2017 by Germany. 10 cases (20 per cent) of those with a travel history available travelled abroad during the incubation period; of these, 7 travelled to different EU countries.

ECDC assessment
The European hepatitis A outbreaks mostly affecting MSM are rapidly spreading and are likely not to have reached their peak yet. The definition of confirmed cases is based on viral RNA sequencing, which is performed on a large proportion of strains and in a timely fashion only in a minority of EU countries. Spain and Italy were reported as 2 of the most affected countries by these outbreaks in the previous ECDC rapid risk assessment; most of the sequencing results from these countries, particularly from Spain, are still pending. The reporting of confirmed cases provides a good indication of the outbreak dynamic. However, due to the challenges in complete and timely reporting of sequencing results, the current figures represent a substantial underestimation of the true extent of these outbreaks.

[Because of specific sexual practices, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to have a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis A and, if not vaccinated in childhood, should be immunized if found to be anti-HAV negative.

In an Italian study (Bordi L, Rozera G, Scognamiglio P, et al. Monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A involving HIV-infected men who have sex with men, Rome, Italy 2008-2009. J Clin Virol. 2012; 54(1): 26-9, abstract available at http://www.journalofclinicalvirology.com/article/S1386-6532(12)00015-7/abstract), a large and long-lasting (18 months or longer) monophyletic outbreak of hepatitis A is reported in the Rome metropolitan area (at least since July 2008), involving a high proportion of HIV-infected MSM. All the infections detected in MSM were attributable to a monophyletic strain of HAV, circulating also in other parts of Europe around the same period. Outbreaks like this can take place despite circulation of heterologous HAV strains in the general population.

The recommendations for HAV vaccination in susceptible adults from the United States' Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] are to vaccinate any person seeking protection from hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection and people with any of the following indications:
- men who have sex with men;
- people who use injected or non-injected illicit drugs;
- people working with HAV-infected primates or with HAV in a research laboratory setting;
- people with chronic liver disease and people who receive clotting factor concentrates;
- people traveling to or working in countries that have high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A; and
- unvaccinated people who anticipate close personal contact (such as household or regular babysitting) with an international adoptee during the 1st 60 days after arrival in the United States from a country with high or intermediate endemicity of hepatitis A. The 1st dose of the 2-dose hepatitis A vaccine series should be administered as soon as adoption is planned, ideally 2 or more weeks before the arrival of the adoptee.

The HAV vaccination history of the cases is not stated. - Mod.LL
