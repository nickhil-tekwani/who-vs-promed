[Infectious hemopoietic necrosis is an acute rhabdovirus infection in fry
and fingerling salmonids that produces high mortality at water temperature
less than or equal to 12 C. Such high mortality may have an economic impact
in certain regions. Affected fish darken, have pale gills, and shed thick
fecal pseudocasts. Both horizontal and waterborne transmissions have been
demonstrated. Asymptomatic carrier fish serve as reservoirs of infection. -
