Enterovirus 71 in Saudi Arabia
------------------------------
I report here the first isolation of Enterovirus 71 from Saudi Arabia. The
virus was identified from tissue culture as enterovirus by RT-PCR (nested
type using 4 primers). The virus type was identified using monoclonal
antibodies from Chemicon Company.
The virus originated from a female child with polio-like paralysis in one
lower limb.

[Recently Enterovirus 71 has been associated mainly with outbreaks of
hand-foot-and-mouth disease in the Asian-Pacific region. However,
Enterovirus 71 is capable of causing severe CNS disease with persisting
flaccid paralysis, and overall it has been the enterovirus predominantly
associated with encephalitis. - Mod.CP
