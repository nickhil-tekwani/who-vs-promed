In winter barley, initial infections with mildew, rhynchosporium, and
net blotch continue in many areas, locally also with leaf rust.
Especially for net blotch, conditions were favourable in the 2nd half
of April 2010. For treatments to protect yield it is important to
keep the youngest 2-3 leaves as well as ears free of fungal infections.

In wheat, 1st infections with _Septoria tritici_ and mildew are
visible but so far restricted to lower leaves. This is mainly due to
favourable conditions at the end of March and in April 2010. The risk
of further infections, especially by septoria, will depend on weather
conditions. Wheat stubble must also be checked for tan spot.

For winter rye, control of leaf rust has priority. Especially warm,
dry conditions will favour spread. In many areas, leaf rust on lower
leaves has spread widely and is already present even on the 3rd leaf.
Monitoring of disease development in these crops should continue.
Mildew and rhynchosporium are also present with 80 to 100 percent of
the crop affected in some locations. However, early infections rarely
spread to the upper leaves, which are important for yield.

Regular monitoring of cereal crops should be carried out, especially
after rains.

[Fungal diseases mentioned are:
Barley: leaf rust (_Puccinia hordei_); net blotch (_Pyrenophora
teres_); scald (_Rhynchosporium secalis_); powdery (_Blumeria
graminis_ f.sp. _hordei_) and/or the less important downy mildew
(_Sclerophthora_ species).

Wheat: Septoria complex (_Mycosphaerella graminicola_ - previously
_Septoria tritici_ - and _Phaeosphaeria nodorum_); powdery (_Erysiphe
graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_, _Blumeria graminis_) and/or downy mildew
(_Sclerophthora macrospora_, crazy top); tan spot (_Pyrenophora
tritici-repentis_).

Rye: leaf rust (_Puccinia recondita_ f.sp. _recondita_); scald
(_Rhynchosporium secalis_); powdery mildew (_Erysiphe graminis_).

These pathogens can seriously affect yield of cereal crops if left
unattended. Management strategies generally include cultural
practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides, use of clean seed, and host
resistance if available. For more information on the diseases see
links below and previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.
