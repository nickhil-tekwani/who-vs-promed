Information received on 8 Feb 2006 from Dr. Mate Brstilo, Director of
the Veterinary Administration, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Zagreb:
End of previous report period: 17 Jan 2006 (see Disease Information,
19 [3], 48, dated 19 Jan 2006).
End of this report period: 8 Feb 2006.
Identification of agent: avian influenza virus serotype H5.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 21 Oct 2005.
Date of start of the event: 19 Oct 2005.
During regular monitoring activities conducted at Ribnjak 1905 fish
pond, samples were taken from 26 wild ducks (_Anas platyrhyncos_) and
sent to the Poultry Centre of the Croatian Veterinary Institute in
Zagreb for analysis. Laboratory testing (after 3 passages in chicken
embryos) revealed that 2 samples were positive for avian influenza
virus subtype H5, but the genetic tests revealed negative results for
N1. The amino-acid chain (PQRTRGL) does not point to a virus of high
pathogenicity. The nucleotide sequence (500 base pairs that encode
for hemagglutinin) resembles that of influenza virus type A (_Anas
platyrhyncos_/Chany Lake/9/03 [H5N3]) isolated in Western Siberia.
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Poultry Centre of
the Croatian Veterinary Institute, Zagreb
Birds examined: 26 wild ducks
Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation in chicken embryos
Date: 7 Feb 2006
Results: H5
Final report: no.

[Please note that the lab report indicates that the isolate was from
ducks and is not the H5N1 virus so prevalent elsewhere but rather
resembles an H5N3 from Western Siberia. Previously, in December 2005,
investigators found an H5N1 in swans from the same pond. December's
H5N1 was fingerprinted and found to be highly similar to virus
subtypes previously identified in Qinghai lake (China), Turkey and
Romania. - Mod.PC]
