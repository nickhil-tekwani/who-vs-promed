Cases of drug-resistant bacteria have slowly increased in Los Angeles
County, baffling doctors because the germs have started striking otherwise
healthy people. Bacteria naturally develop resistance to treatments over
time, but public health officials say the overuse and inappropriate use of
antibiotics has hastened the process. "The infection continues to do its
thing during initial treatment so more
damage can happen," said Dr. David Dassey, deputy chief of Acute
Communicable Disease Control at the county Health Department.
Drug-resistant strains of bacteria are usually confined to people who have
taken antibiotics before, mostly patients in hospitals and nursing homes
where infections hop from bed to bed. However, doctors now say these
so-called super-bacteria are beginning to appear in the general population
among people with no previous hospitalizations. Such was the case with a
67-year-old patient at St. Josephs Medical Center who nearly died from a
recent ear infection caused by a drug-resistant strain of _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_.
First-line antibiotics failed to stop the bug, giving it time to race
through his bloodstream and attack his heart, said Dr. Milton Louie, an
infectious disease specialist who advises epidemiologists at St. Josephs.
The patient, who has not been identified, endured surgery and four weeks of
treatment with vancomycin, one of the most toxic and expensive antibiotics,
before the germ was knocked down. Side effects to vancomycin can include
hearing loss, severe rashes and phlebitis. "I've been in practice for 20
years  and this is something definitely different," Louie said.
In 1998, 24 percent of the 659 _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ cases reported to
the county involved bacteria resistant to penicillin. In the first 6 months
of 1999, that rose to 28.9 percent, according to county health services.
Meantime, Glendale Memorial Medical Center reported a 10 percent increase
in the number of cases of _Staphylococcus aureus_ resistant to
methicillin, the class of antibiotics that includes penicillin, between
1998 and 1999. And _Staphylococcus_ continues to build resistance to
vancomycin, a treatment some doctors consider the last line of defense
against super-bacteria.
"After vancomycin, youre going to see people dead," said Dr. Brian
Johnston, an emergency room physician at White Memorial Medical Center and
a member of the county Department of Health Services Health Advisory
Committee.
