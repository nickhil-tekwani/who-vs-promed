Anthrax claims 20 cows, cattle market closed
--------------------------------------------
A total of 20 cows, which died in Agalpur block [in Balangir,
Orissa], were confirmed to have contracted anthrax bacteria. This was
revealed after the district administration received the post-mortem
report. Alert has been sounded across the area to check spread of
anthrax to humans. Official sources said 3 panchayats [local
government at village level] of Agalpur block -- Jharnipali,
Podapali, and Bharsuja -- are under observation.

The chief district veterinary officer and other officials are camping
in the village to keep off people from animal carcasses. Around 40
000 [doses of vaccine] have been brought for extensive vaccination of animals.

"As part of precautionary measures, we have ordered to close down the
nearby Roth cattle market. Section 144 has been imposed on Roth
market," announced collector RS Gopalan. Official sources, however,
confirmed that no humans have yet been affected.

[OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) has reported outbreaks of
livestock anthrax in Orissa each year since 2004 where outbreaks
consistently affect mainly cattle, or so the Indian reports indicate.
In 2004 there were 6 outbreaks affecting 32 cattle, in 2005, 3 and 23
head, and in 2007, 10 outbreaks affecting 67 cattle and 4 sheep and
goats simultaneously affected with the cattle in one outbreak. The
Orissa authorities would be wise if they initiated a programme of
proactive annual vaccination. This is more cost effective than
mounting the veterinary cavalry each time to try to limit outbreaks
when they occur, as they will regularly with this type of control.
