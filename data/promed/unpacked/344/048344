More than 2000 poultry have died in 4 tambons [local government units in
Thailand; below district (amphoe) and province (changwat), they form the 3rd
administrative subdivision level] in Wang Sai Phun district in the past few
days. The district has been declared an animal disease infection area. [Wang
Sai Phun is situated within the Phichit province; map at

Local livestock officials warned local residents not to eat the meat of
poultry that died suddenly. They were running laboratory tests on samples from
the dead poultry.
Pracha Aswametha, a livestock officer, said initially he suspected _E. coli_
infection was the cause of the mass poultry death.

[No lab results are reported to confirm the suspicion that _E. coli_ is the
etiological agent involved in the poultry mortality. It is not apparent that
H5N1 has been ruled out. A request for laboratory results would be in order. -

[Thailand has meticulously and continuously reported its HPAI status since its
initial official report on the disease on 24 Jan 2004. On 31 Mar 2006,
a "final report" was sent to the OIE, stating the following:
"140 days have elapsed since the last case of highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) in Thailand (on 9 Nov 2005), where stamping-out with
compensation was employed.
In February 2006, the Department of Livestock Development conducted the first
biannual HPAI active surveillance. During the month, 57 461 cloacal swab
samples were collected for virus isolation. To date, no new positive case has
been reported in Thailand."
No other reports have been sent after the above final report. Results of the
current laboratory investigation, hopefully ruling out AI, are indeed
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
