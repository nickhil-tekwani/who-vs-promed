Man in critical condition in ricin case
---------------------------------------
Police in Las Vegas, NV, said a man is in critical condition after
being found unconscious in a motel room with a powder suspected of
being the poison ricin, the Associated Press reported Friday [29 Feb
2008]. He is one of 7 people hospitalized in the incident, but 6 of
them were admitted only as a precaution. The presence of the
unconscious body may have been what alerted the motel's staff that
something was amiss and led to the discovery of the powder, which
preliminary tests identified.

The disclosure of the man's critical condition came as authorities
were conducting definitive tests of the powder. But they said it did
not appear to be intended for use in a terror attack.

"This event does not appear to be terrorism related," a spokesman for
the FBI said in Washington, according to the Associated Press. The
spokesman, Richard Kolko, said the FBI was assisting local police in
the investigation.

Las Vegas police said the substance and castor beans, from which
ricin is derived, were found on Thursday [28 Feb 2008] by a man
clearing out a suite at the Extended Stay America Motel, not far from
the city's famous Strip. The man, whom the police did not identify,
said the substance did not belong to him and when he became
suspicious about it, he took it to the motel manager's office. The
manager called the police, who alerted other 1st responder agencies.
The powder was identified as ricin from preliminary tests.

"Ricin is very serious," said Captain Joseph Lombardo of the Las
Vegas police, according to the website of The Las Vegas Review
Journal. "[An amount] the size the head of a pin can be deadly," he
said at a news conference Thursday evening [28 Feb 2008].

A total of 3 employees of the motel and 3 police officers were
hospitalized as a precaution. None appeared to display any symptoms
of poisoning.

At the news conference, Captain Lombardo said ricin had extremely
limited legitimate uses. "Ricin has no medical uses other than cancer
research," he said. "An individual citizen, other than being involved
in cancer research or cancer prevention, would not have any legal
means or proper means for having that."

Police cordoned off the area and isolated the suite where the powder
was discovered. Television images showed people in hazardous
materials [protection] suits moving about the area.

Man Critical After Ricin Find in Vegas
--------------------------------------
Vials found in the motel room of a man hospitalized in critical
condition tested positive for the deadly toxin ricin, authorities
said Friday [29 Feb 2008]. There was no indication of any link to
terrorist activity, Las Vegas police Deputy Chief Kathy Suey said at
a press conference.

The man was admitted to Spring Valley Hospital in Las Vegas in
critical condition on 14 Feb 2008, hospital spokeswoman Naomi Jones
said. Suey said he had made an emergency call for help because of
breathing problems. His name was not made public.

The investigation of the apparent ricin didn't begin until Thursday
[28 Feb 2008], police said, after someone Suey identified as "a
friend or relative" went to the sick man's hotel room to retrieve his
belongings and found "several" vials of a powder and took them to the
motel manager. Police were ultimately called to the Extended Stay
America Motel several blocks west of the Las Vegas Strip.

A total of 7 people, including the man who found the ricin, the
manager, 2 other motel employees and 3 police officers were
decontaminated at the scene and taken to hospitals for examination
but none have shown any signs of being affected by ricin, Suey said.
All were released overnight.

Ricin is made from processing castor beans and can be extremely
lethal. As little as 500 micrograms, or about the size of the head of
a pin, can kill a human, according to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.

"During our investigation we did find that there was a subject who
had been a previous occupant of that hotel room who is currently
hospitalized in critical condition here locally, as a possible result
of exposure to ricin," Suey said.

2 preliminary tests, one by police and one by the Nevada National
Guard, concluded that the substance was ricin. A 3rd test from a
local lab confirmed the results, Suey said.

"There is no information to lead us to believe that this is the
result of any terrorist activity or related to any possible terrorist
activity," she said. "We don't even know that it was him that was in
possession of the ricin."

Police said the sick man, believed to be in his 40s or 50s, is not
considered to be a criminal suspect. Suey said he was unconscious,
and police had not been able to interview him. Suey would not say how
many vials were found or how much ricin they contained. Officials
said the vials were in a plastic bag, and castor beans also were
found in the room.

Police said they spent 12 hours containing and cleaning up the site.
"My understanding is cleanup has been done. There should not be a
threat to anybody at this time," said Dr. Lawrence Sands, chief
health officer of the Southern Nevada Health District.

Jones, the hospital spokeswoman, said no one else at the hospital is
at risk of exposure. "The patient who has been exposed is not
contagious to anyone else, as ricin has to be injected, ingested or
inhaled. We are following the universal blood-borne pathogen
protocols and cooperating with investigators at this time," Jones said.

The motel manager had begun an eviction process because the sick man
hadn't paid his bill, and the man who found the vial[s] had gone to
the room to retrieve [the sick man's] belongings. Suey said he
claimed to be a relative of the sick man. Suey said there were
several pets in the room when officers arrived. A dog was found dead
but the animal had gone at least a week without food or water, Suey
said, and she did not attribute the death to ricin.

[The manifestations of illness in the affected man are not stated and
it is not clearly known whether the illness is due to ricin. The
following is extracted (citations removed) from: Lutwick LI, Gradon
J, Zellen J: Category B Biotoxins. In Lutwick LI, Lutwick SM (eds),
Beyond Anthrax: Bioterror - The Weaponization of Infectious Diseases.
Springer-Humana, New York (in press):

"Ricin is found in castor beans from the plant _Ricinus communis_ and
is a residual product of the production of castor oil. The oil has
applications as a purgative, an engine lubricant, and as a component
of brake and hydraulic fluid. The industry is no longer active in the
United States but the oil is produced in large quantities in other
areas of the world. Importantly, the oil, if properly prepared, does
not contain the toxin.

"One million tons of castor beans are used each year for producing
the oil. The waste mash from the oil production process can have as
much as 5 percent ricin by weight and is easily and inexpensively
isolated via a simple process in a low technology setting using
materials easily obtainable. Ricin is easily prepared in liquid or
crystalline firms or as a readily aerosolized, lyophilized powder.
The toxin is stable and can be poisonous in its native form in the beans.

"Ricin is a 66 kD [kiloDalton] globular protein with a toxic mode of
action of inhibiting protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The
mechanism is due to the enzymatic removal of a single adenine residue
from (amino acid 4324) close to the 3-prime end of 28S ribosomal RNA.
The removal prevents elongation factor-2 from binding. Structurally
it is made up of 2 approximately equal molecular weight subunits, the
A and B chains, linked by a disulfide bond. The B chain facilitates
binding to cell surfaces and entry into the cell through binding to
terminal galactose moieties of cellular membrane glycolipids and
glycoproteins.

"The clinical presentation of ricin poisoning depends on whether the
exposure is parenteral, inhaled, or ingested. In mice, the dose found
to be lethal to 50 percent (LD50) of animals was found to be 3-5
microg/kg in inhalation or intravenous exposures and 20-25 microg/kg
in intraperitoneal, subcutaneous or intragastric administration. The
time to death in the mice was 60 hours for inhalation, 90 hours for
intravenous and 80-100 hours for the other exposures. It is important
to note that there is a variation of as much as 2 logarithms
[100-fold] in the microg/kg dose of ricin between animals, with the
horse seeming to be the most sensitive and the frog and chicken the
least. The 1st symptoms of toxicity generally occur 6-12 hours after
exposure but can occur as early as 3 hours. This is longer than many
of the chemical agents affecting the lung and more rapid than
infectious agents. In humans, as seemed to have occurred in the
Georgi Markov assassination, multiorgan failure occurred with a
prominently elevated white blood cell count. [Markov was a Bulgarian
communist defector who was killed in London in 2003 by a ricin pellet
injected into his leg from a modified umbrella point -- see:

- Mod.JW]

"As a weapon of bioterrorism, ricin would most likely be dispersed as
an aerosol although contamination of food and water supplies is also
feasible. Although easily obtained, massive quantities of toxin are
necessary to create a large scale effect. Because signs and symptoms
are non-specific, detection of an attack would require a high index
of suspicion based on clinical and epidemiologic factors. The finding
of a geographic cluster of patients with acute lung injury should
arouse suspicion of an attack via an aerosolized agent, although the
list of potential culprits is extensive and includes chemical as well
as biologic agents. Ricin cases do not exhibit mediastinitis, as with
anthrax, and they do not demonstrate any response to antibiotic
therapy as would be expected with an infectious etiology. Pulmonary
edema may develop one to 3 days after ricin exposure, in contrast to
staphyloccocal enterotoxin B or phosgene where time to development of
pulmonary edema is 12 and 6 hours respectively.

"There is limited data describing the outcome from an inhalation
exposure. In the 1940s, sublethal and accidental exposures were said
to have occurred and were manifest 4-8 hours after exposure with
fever, cough, shortness of breath and nausea. Studies in rodents
suggest an inhaled ricin aerosol could lead to necrosis of the upper
and lower airway, respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory
failure. Chest x-ray would be expected to show bilateral infiltrates.
In animal studies death occurred in 36 to 72 hours and was dose
dependent. In primates, symptoms and time to death were also dose
related and associated with alveolar flooding, fibropurulent
pneumonia and necrotizing tracheitis. Death occurred 36 to 48 hours
after challenge following a 8-24 hour preclinical period." - Mod.LL]
