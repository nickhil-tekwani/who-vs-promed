National Public Health Laboratory, Teku [Kathmandu], on [Sun 17 Sep 2017] confirmed 8 hepatitis A cases. It said of the 15 samples received from Besisahar, Lamjung [Province Four], 8 tested positive for hepatitis A. Of them, 5 are female and 3 male.

A team from Epidemiology and Disease Control Division [EDCD] had visited Lamjung after reports of hepatitis outbreak. Samples were collected and brought to Kathmandu for test. "The patients contracted the disease due to contamination of water and food," informed Resham Lamichhane, public health officer at EDCD.

"The hepatitis A virus, which causes infection, spreads when a person ingests faecal matter," informed Dr Bikash Jaishi, DM (hepatology), Liver Unit, Bir Hospital, Kathmandu.

As the virus transmits from contaminated food and water, doctors have advised people to drink boiled water and eat fresh food.
