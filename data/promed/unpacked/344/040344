Teenage boy sparks measles alert
--------------------------------
A teenage boy who is thought to have caught measles while overseas has
sparked a health warning in South Australia (SA). Authorities today [11 Feb
2009] said they would try to check on anyone who had come in contact with
the boy over the past week.

Jane Raupach, from SA Health's Communicable Diseases Control Branch, said
measles was highly contagious among people who were not fully immunised.
"Measles is spread through coughing and sneezing," Dr Raupach said. "The
illness begins with a fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes followed by a
rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the body. Complications
of measles can be severe."

Dr Raupach said immunisation provided the best protection against measles
while most people born before 1966 had had the disease and would,
therefore, be immune. She said SA Health staff were contacting people who
might have been exposed to the latest case between 3 and 7 Feb 2009 by
checking places where the teenager went including a Coles supermarket at
Stirling, in the Adelaide Hills, a deli at suburban Kensington Park, and a
Chemmart Pharmacy in Stirling. They said he also caught public buses
between Kensington Park and Mt Barker before presenting at the Women's and
Children's Hospital on 7 Feb 2009.

Dr Raupach said anyone with suspected measles symptoms should contact their
doctor.
