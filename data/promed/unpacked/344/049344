----------------------------------------------------------------------
A case of severe _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria was diagnosed in August 2018 in a Moroccan man living in Tuscany, Italy. Malaria was initially not considered by the managing clinicians because the patient reported to have not recently visited any endemic country, leading to diagnostic delay and severe anaemia. Here we describe the clinical and epidemiological features of this case and discuss different hypotheses on the possible route of transmission.

Case report
-----------
A previously healthy Moroccan man in his late 40s was admitted to an internal medicine ward of a tertiary hospital in Florence, Italy, in mid-August 2018, with a 3-day history of high fever (higher than 38.5 deg C [101.3 deg F]), headache, and mild cough. At physical examination, jaundice and splenomegaly were observed. Blood tests showed thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, and increased inflammatory markers (Table [available at the source URL above]). A haematological disease was suspected, while malaria was initially not considered, since the patient declared to have not recently visited any endemic area. On Day 4 after admission, investigation for malaria was requested following an infectious diseases consultation. Thin blood smears revealed the presence of _P. falciparum_ trophozoites with a parasitaemia of 0.5%. PCR confirmed _P. falciparum_ mono-infection. The patient was referred to the Infectious and Tropical Diseases Unit with the diagnosis of severe malaria (haemoglobin (Hb) less than 7 g/dL and parasitaemia greater than 0.2%), and intravenous artesunate was administered for 2 days, followed by oral dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for 3 days. 2 units of packed red blood cells were transfused. The patient's condition improved and he was discharged a few days later. The case was notified to public health authorities (malaria is a mandatory notifiable disease in Italy) and microscopically confirmed by the National Institute of Health, Rome, Italy.

Epidemiological discussion
--------------------------
A careful history on possible malaria exposure was collected in collaboration with a Moroccan cultural mediator. The patient was born and had grown up in the Marrakesh-Safi Region, Morocco, before moving to Italy in 1990. He currently lives in an urbanised area of the province of Florence, Italy, about 10 km [6.2 mi] away from the city centre, where has been working, discontinuously, as a construction worker. He denied previous blood transfusions and intravenous drug use. He reported a 1-month travel to Ghana looking for a job in 2014. On that occasion, upon his arrival at Accra airport, he received an injection (probably, yellow fever vaccine) and was provided with some tablets (possibly antimalarial drug) that he took for about one week. During his stay in Ghana and thereafter, he did not present febrile diseases. He reported 2 to 3 travels to Morocco per year, to visit relatives in his village of origin for periods of up to 2 months. He returned from his last travel to Morocco, arriving by plane from Marrakech to Pisa in early June 2018, 73 days before the onset of symptoms. He slept one night in his residence near Florence, then moved by train to Viareggio, and subsequently worked outside as a beach vendor on the Tuscan coast during the summer. He stayed at the seaside and slept outdoors on the beach or in nearby places (for example in the pine forests along the coast, just behind the sand dunes), together with other beach vendors, including persons from Sub-Saharan Africa. The patient remembered many mosquito bites. He changed his location daily gradually moving south, and recalled having worked in beach resorts of Cecina, San Vincenzo, and Piombino, while he was not certain to have reached more southern beaches in the Maremma area. He returned to the starting point in Viareggio in mid-August 2018. Then, he spent some time in a village near Bologna, and finally reached his home, 2 days later when he started to have fever in the afternoon. Over the whole summer, the patient worked and travelled with a group of newly-arrived men from Morocco who returned to their country on the day of fever onset in the patient; according to him all were in good health. No other information about them was available.

Discussion [abridged]
---------------------
The case presented, together with other _P. falciparum_ malaria cases recently reported from Apulia, may suggest the occurrence of sporadic autochthonous _P. falciparum_ during the summer season in Italy. However, considering that the susceptibility to _P. falciparum_ infection of the anthropophilic _Anopheles_ species present in Tuscany area is very low, and that the possibility of unrevealed risk factors for acquiring malaria cannot be completely excluded, the presented case remains cryptic. Some travellers may inadvertently or deliberately fail to mention that they have recently been in an endemic area.

The fact that 4 patients recently diagnosed with _P. falciparum_ malaria in Italy were Moroccan citizens remains difficult to explain, considering that Morocco is a malaria-free country. In our patient, malaria diagnosis was delayed because of the missing history of a recent visit to a malaria endemic area. In this perspective, clinicians should consider malaria as one possible differential diagnosis in patients with compatible clinical and laboratory features, even if they do not report a clear exposure to endemic countries.

[A recent review of malaria in Italy (Benelli G, Pombi M, Otranto D. Malaria in Italy -- Migrants are not the cause. Trends Parasitol. 2018; 34(5): 351-4) points out that it generally believed that the present _Anopheles_ species found in Italy are not able to transmit _Plasmodium falciparum_.

It is puzzling that the patient was from Morocco, as there were 4 cases of _P. falciparum_ malaria in Moroccan nationals in Puglia, Italy in 2017 (see ProMED-mail Malaria - Italy (03): (PU) local transmission, RFI: 20171006.5363068). All 4 lived in the same area and had not visited Morocco for several years. Morocco is currently regarded as malaria free (WHO World Malaria Report 2017; https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2017/en/).

Malaria can be transmitted by blood such as by sharing needles, but asymptomatic cases in non-immunes like people from Morocco, is highly unlikely. A genetic analysis of the _P. falciparum_ from the 4 cases in Moroccans in Puglia in 2017 and this case would show if there is any link. - Mod.EP
