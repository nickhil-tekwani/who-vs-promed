Progress Towards Development of a Human West Nile Virus Vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON: Human trials to test a vaccine against West Nile virus (WNV) could
begin early next year, according to the head of a small British firm
enlisted to help fight the disease. Acambis, a biotechnology firm based in
Cambridge, England, is in the final stages of testing its ChimeriVax (WNV
vaccine) on animals and is gearing up for human trials, the firm's Chief
Executive John Brown told Reuters on Wed 23 May 2001. "In a couple of
months we should be able to say that we have something that is suitable for
human studies and we could have a human trial in the first quarter of next
year," he said.
The mosquito-borne WNV was unknown in North America until 2 years ago, when
it caused the death of 7 people in the New York City area. The [virus,
which can cause inflammation of the brain and most often affects the
elderly and those with weakened immune systems, has since spread along the
East Coast. Now there are fears the virus, which has also infected
thousands of birds and numerous horses, could sweep through the warm,
southeastern states with their large populations [of senior citizens.
Brown cautioned that the Acambis vaccine was still 3 or 4 years from
reaching the market, even if it successfully completed clinical trials. The
firm's research is being funded by a 3-million-dollar US government grant;
the potential market for the vaccine is estimated at 300 million dollars.
The Acambis vaccine is based on the 60-year-old yellow fever vaccine, the
safest anti-viral vaccine known to man, Brown said. Yellow fever [virus is
closely related to WNV and adapting the yellow fever vaccine to protect
against WNV was a relatively simple task for Acambis scientists. "It was a
cut-and-paste job. We took the yellow fever vaccine [virus, and deleted
the structural information region of the genome and substituted the
corresponding WNV sequence ," Brown said. [Yellow fever virus and WNV are
both members of the genus _Flavivirus_. of the family _Flaviviridae_.
However, they belong to distinct serogroups within the genus. WNV is
included in the Japanese encephalitis virus group and yellow fever virus is
a member of the yellow fever virus group. - Mod.CP.

[A vaccine is available in Israel to protect domestic geese against WNV
infection. This vaccine is an attenuated strain of Israel turkey
meningoencephalitis virus (a member of the Ntaya serogroup of the genus
_Flavivirus_), which has been in use in Israel for 24 years in turkeys.
Experience has shown that it can be used safely in geese. This vaccine has
not been used in other vertebrates. - Mod.CP
