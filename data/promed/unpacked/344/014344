The description given might indicate Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, but
it also corresponds to the findings of Dr. A.M. Zaki for a disease referred
to as Saudi Mystery Disease, whose etiologic agent is a flavivirus
antigenically similar to the agent of Kyasanur Forest Disease. The
reference is:
Zaki, A.M.: Isolation of a flavivirus related to the tick borne
encephalitis complex from human cases in Saudi Arabia. Trans. Roy. Soc.
Trop. Med. & Hyg. 9(12): 179-181. 1997.

[In September 1997 ProMED-mail posted a series of messages regarding a
similar illness in Saudi Arabia. At that time the flavivirus that was
associated with those illnesses was reported informally by CDC to be
closely related antigenically to Kyasanur Forest disease virus, a
tick-borne virus first isolated in India but not known to occur in the
Middle East. Because KFD and related viruses must be handled in facilities
having high containment (BSL-4), tests were incomplete. However, results
available were such as to allow the naming of the virus from Saudi Arabia
-- Fakeeh virus.
The cases in Abu Dhabi may be shown to have been caused by this newly
discovered flavivirus but it is more likely, based on probability, that the
etiologic agent of these cases is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
Until we have data in this regard, we shall simply have to wait. If any of
our subscribers has such data, we would appreciate hearing about it. -
