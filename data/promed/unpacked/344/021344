Poliovirus weekly update 6-Sep-2017, World Health Organization
--------------------------------------------------------------
New wild poliovirus cases reported this week: 1
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2017: 10
Total number of wild poliovirus cases in 2016: 37

New cVDPV cases reported this week: 0
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2017: 47
Total number of cVDPV cases in 2016: 5

Headlines
---------
- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: Pakistan: 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case from Karachi (pre-notified last week) and 4 environmental WPV1-positive samples.

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 6. The most recent case in the country had onset of paralysis on [10 Jul 2017], from Zabul province, neighbouring Kandahar province and Pakistan.
- Given the epidemiological situation in the southern Afghanistan, the program has planned a special targeted round in 22 districts of the region during the 2nd week of September [2017]. This will target 1.2 million children aged less than 5 years. Preparations continue to ensure the highest possible vaccination quality.

Pakistan
--------
- Following its pre-notification last week, one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was officially reported in the past week, from Karachi, Pakistan. The case had onset of paralysis on [11 Aug 2017], and is the most recent case in the country. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 is now 4.
- Also reported this week are 4 new WPV1-positive environmental samples, 3 of them also from Karachi.
- Following the reporting of polio cases from Karachi, a filed investigation is underway to determine further details of this latest case, and a response is being planned.
- In follow up to the advice of the Prime Minister of Pakistan during the National Task Force meeting (held in the last week of August [2017]), for all possible actions to stop WPV-1 transmission in Quetta Block and Karachi, the National Emergency Operation Centre leadership is visiting both these places this week. The mission will review the epidemiological situation in both the regions and appraise the status of preparations for the upcoming SIAs [supplementary immunization activities]. The mission will also discuss the implementation of the recommendations from the National Task Force for Polio Eradication held in August 2017.

Nigeria
-------
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.
- In Borno, an emergency response team is to begin reacting to the recent cholera outbreak using polio infrastructure. This may have the benefit of strengthening both responses.

Lake Chad Basin
---------------
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto provinces in Nigeria in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.

Central Africa
--------------
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year remains 8, in 2 separate outbreaks: in Haut Lomami province (6 cases, with onset of paralysis of the most recent case on [20 Jun 2017]); and in Maniema province (2 cases with onset of paralysis on [26 Mar 2017 and 18 Apr 2017], with an additional isolate detected in a healthy individual with sample collection on 2 May [2017]).
- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time. Outbreak response is taking place, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols, targeting more than 750 000 children under the age of 5 across the 2 provinces.
- The 1st mOPV2 round was implemented on [27-29 Jun 2017] in the 2 affected provinces; and the 2nd mOPV2 round ran from [13-15 Jul 2017] in Haut Lomami and [20-22 Jul 2017] in Maniema.
- Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighbouring countries.

Middle East
-----------
- In Syria, no new cases were reported in the past week, maintaining the total number of cases in this outbreak at 39. Onset of paralysis of these cases is between [3 Mar 2017 and 10 Jul 2017]. The bulk of all cases are from Mayadeen, the epicentre of this outbreak.
- Confirmation of additional cases is not unexpected at this time and would not change the operational situation, as outbreak response plans are being finalized and implemented, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. 2 vaccination campaigns are planned for both Deir-Ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates.
- The 1st mOPV2 round in Deir-Ez-Zor was successfully carried out between [22-26 Jul 2017]. Independent post-campaign monitoring reflected coverage of 88.4 percent (based on caregiver recall).
- The 2nd immunization round for Deir-Ez-Zor governorate was completed last week. Monovalent OPV2 was provided for children between 0-59 months of age, and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) for children 2-23 months. In addition to polio vaccines, Aqua Tabs are being provided to families for water purification -- 2.5 tons of water purification tablets for 400 000 people have been disseminated at health centers.
- Plans are being finalized to mitigate the risks of further spread from the outbreak zone to neighbouring areas and countries, including immunization of at-risk populations in northwest Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon.

[The update above adds the case of WPV1 associated polio in Karachi Pakistan that had been mentioned in last week's update. Of note is the mention of 4 positive environmental samples in Pakistan this week, 3 from Karachi and 1 from elsewhere - not specified, As the summary goes on to mention the Quetta block as a high risk zone, one wonders if this isolate was from Quetta.

While there appears to be a lull in reported cVDPV cases in both Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the wording of the above report suggests there are additional probable cases pending laboratory confirmation reports.
