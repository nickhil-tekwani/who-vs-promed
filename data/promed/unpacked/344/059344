A 10-year-old Cambodian girl has died from bird flu, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Monday [28 May 2012], the country's 3rd fatality from the virulent disease this year [2012].

The child developed a fever and shortness of breath on 20 May 2012 and died on Sunday [27 May 2012], the WHO said in a joint statement with the Cambodian Health Ministry.

Hospital tests confirmed she had contracted the H5N1 strain of avian influenza [virus]. There is evidence of recent deaths among poultry in the village, and the patient prepared sick chickens for food prior to becoming sick, the statement said.

The girl, from southwestern Kampong Speu province, is the 21st person in Cambodia to become infected with the H5N1 virus since 2003. 19 of those cases have been fatal.
