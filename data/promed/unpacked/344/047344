84 people at risk after measles exposure
----------------------------------------
Health authorities are now trying to contact 84 people exposed to measles
by a baby who flew from London to Christchurch via Auckland. The baby
arrived in Auckland on Air New Zealand flight NZ1 on Mon 7 Dec 2009, before
travelling to Christchurch on flight NZ509. Auckland and Canterbury health
authorities are trying to contact people sitting near the baby on both
flights; for the international leg, 56 people sitting in rows 56-60 were at
risk while 28 people sitting in rows 13-17 were exposed on the domestic flight.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service medical officer of health Dr Brad
Novak said it was important people in those rows were alerted to the risk
of measles because it was a serious and highly infectious which could
spread rapidly in unimmunised groups.

"These passengers, or their family members, who have symptoms suggestive of
measles are advised to immediately seek advice from a doctor," Dr Novak
said. "Call ahead to alert your doctor or practice nurse about the
possibility of measles as this will allow them to arrange to assess you
safely without infecting others. People who suspect they may have measles
should avoid contact with young children and pregnant women."

Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Ramon Pink said the baby's parents
had taken it to their doctor for cold-like symptoms before travelling. They
were given antibiotics but measles was not suspected. "They've done what
any other parent would do -- they've sought advice and they've followed
that advice," Dr Pink said. It had not become apparent that the baby had
the measles until this week.

Those most at risk of contracting the disease were those who had not had
the measles, mumps, rubella [MMR] vaccine or who had just had one dose of
it. Anyone born before 1969 was likely to be immune without having had the
vaccine [due to prior exposure to measles virus infection. - Mod.CP].

Measles is spread by breathing, coughing and sneezing, and can cause a
rash, high fever, runny nose and sore, watery eyes. It is occasionally
fatal. The measles incubation period is up to 21 days.

[Since the earlier ProMED-mail report (Measles - New Zealand (07):
in-flight exposure, alert 20091217.4267) the alert has been extended to
include 56 people seated in rows 56-60 on the intercontinental flight from
London (UK). Again, since most adults will be immune to measles virus
infection, the risk of transmission of disease is low.
