An emergency situation has been declared in Kotlassky Municipal District after the detection of 6 cases of tularemia and the threat of the disease spreading. Of the 6 cases, 3 are from the town of Kotlas and the other 3 from the village of Shipitsyno.

According to the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], on 17 Aug 2012, there were 3 cases, and to date, there are 6, including an 8-year-old child. All of them have been hospitalized and are undergoing the necessary treatment.

The press service of the regional emergency department reported that in view of the current situation, the district Commission on Emergency Situations will budget the necessary resources to carry out anti-epidemic measures and disinfection treatments. Specialists from Rospotrebnadzor and the Ministry of Health are in the area.

Tularemia is a dangerous infection characterized by intoxication, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Tularemia is most common in rural areas. Human infections are rare in the city and are associated with infected products or animals. Often, the sources of infection are common field and house mice, water rats, rabbits, muskrats, hamsters, and other rodents.

Tularemia infection can occur through contact with sick rodents or their droppings, by consumption of contaminated food or water, from infected secretions from rodents, via airborne dust when processing contaminated cereals and fodder, and by mosquitoes.

One of the characteristics of tularemia is an almost 100 percent susceptibility to the disease regardless of age. There is no person-to-person transmission, and persons who have had the disease acquire immunity to it.

[The manifestations of tularemia in the reported cases are not specified. Tularemia can present in a number of ways based on the mode of acquisition. The acquisition of _F. tularensis_ can be from tick and deer fly bites, skin contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated food or water, laboratory exposure, and inhalation of contaminated dusts or aerosols. - Mod.LL]
