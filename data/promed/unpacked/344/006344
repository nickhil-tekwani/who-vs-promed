[No clinical signs are given nor is there any indication of the situation under which the infection might have been acquired. As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the cases. Cases of hantavirus infection with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from various parts of Argentina in recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Marciel virus (in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_), Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba (in _Oligoryzomys forensi_) and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. chaoensis_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case. It might have been due to infection by the Buenos Aires virus. The rodent host of this virus has not been determined. - Mod.TY
