On 20 Dec 2018, the World Health Organization officially notified 2 cases of human infection of avian influenza A(H9N2) in China, retrospectively confirmed.

The 1st case is a 10-month-old girl from Yunfu, Guangdong province, whose disease started on 16 Oct 2018. The case was benign. She had a history of contact with live poultry. The 2nd case is a 3-year-old boy from Guilin, Guangxi[-Zhuang autonomous region] province, who contracted the disease on 10 Oct 2018. The patient did not have contact with live poultry. These are the 5th and 6th human cases of avian influenza A(H9N2) virus notified by China in 2018.

Previous cases have been reported in Anhui province, Guangdong province, and Beijing province.

A total of 22 human cases infected with the avian influenza A (H9N2) virus have been reported worldwide since December 2015.

The Chinese authorities carry out epidemiological investigations and implement preventive and control measures.

Human cases related to A(H9N2) virus are detected sporadically and are not unexpected in areas where the virus is endemic in the poultry population. Direct contact with infected birds or a contaminated environment is the most likely source of infection. The risk for the European Union is very low, however, cases related to travel to endemic countries cannot be excluded.

[H9N2 influenza viruses of the Eurasian lineage were shown to contribute the 6 internal gene segments of the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus after the 1st human case was reported in 1997. Phylogenetically, the Eurasian H9N2 influenza viruses can be classified into 3 groups represented by prototype viruses, namely A/Quail/Hong Kong/97 (G1 lineage), A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280 (Y280 lineage), and A/Chicken/Korea 38349--p96323/96 (Korean lineage). H9N2 viruses of the G1 lineage have spread throughout the poultry industry of Eurasia and are particularly prevalent in chickens, in which they cause low‚Äêpathogenic inapparent infections unless the birds are coinfected with other poultry disease agents (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6185884/).

According to the WHO monthly risk assessments until November 2018, 38 human cases of avian influenza A/H9N2 had been reported (not including the 2 most recent cases). One of the 2 cases had history of direct contact with live poultry.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human (or animal) health, especially over the coming winter months. Continued vigilance is needed within affected and neighbouring areas to detect infections in animals and humans. Collaboration between the animal and human health sectors is essential. As the extent of virus circulation in animals is not clear, epidemiological and virological surveillance and the follow-up of suspected human cases should remain high.

New guidance on investigation of non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases has been published on the WHO website at http://www.who.int/influenza/resources/publications/outbreak_investigation_protocol/en/. - Mod.UBA
