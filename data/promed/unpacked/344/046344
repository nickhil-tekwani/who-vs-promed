Dr Aileen Plant wrote that animals in Western Australia are more likely to
be adjusted to temperature changes whereas in Victoria these changes are
unusual.We keep the same species of farm animals here in WA as in Victoria.
When temperatures are very hot, not all animals "adapt". If not properly
attended to, they may die.
Perhaps in the Southern parts of Western Australia, the climate is somewhat
similar to Victoria and kinder to farm animals, however Victoria also
regularly has high Summer temperatures as the norm and as elsewhere people
and animals cope as best they can.
Dr Plant writes that the majority of the Australian population lives on the
Eastern Seaboard and this is quite correct. However, Perth is a very urban
city of over 1 million people and we are just as susceptible to salmonella
outbreaks as any other capital city.
Victoria which lies on the Eastern seaboard, while being a small state has
the second highest population in Australia with about 3 million people in
its capital city of Melbourne (a densly populated multicultural capital city).
A major headline in Tuesday April 8th's "Australian" newspaper read "More
food recalled as crisis grows". This article reported that the number of
food inspectors in Victoria has been slashed by almost 40% while
prosecutions of unscrupulous handlers have fallen by more than 70% since the
[current] Victorian government came to power according to a survey of local
councils [our Australian local government authorities].
The survey, conducted by the State Opposition, was released as the Victorian
Health Department confirmed the sixth food contamination scare in less than
a month with the recall of a soft cheese by its manufacturer and a well
known supermarket chain also issued a recall on a type of thin sausage made
in Victoria.
The Australian also reported that "The spate of food contaminations in
Victoria prompted public health officials from Australia and New Zealand
yesterday to renew their support for national uniform standards on food
hygeine, with a draft code expected this month and final standards by the
end of the year."
Also reported was that "A spokeswoman for the Victorian Department of Health
said yesterday the manufacturers of a soft cheese had recalled the cheese as
a precautionary measure after listeria monocytogenes bacteria was detected
during routine quality control checks at the factory." The spokeswoman said
no illness had been reported.
In a seperate incident, a well known supermarket chain recalled all barbeque
thin and thin sausages made by one Victorian manufacturer after traces of
crayon were detected in the products. A spokeswoman for the supermarket said
the sausages turned blue when cooked, but did not pose any threat to public
health as the crayon was non toxic.
A recent survey of 78 councils showed the number of food inspectors had been
cut from 317 to 199, since councils were amalgamated and compulsory
competitive tendering introduced. Some councils had experienced a 60 per
cent drop in environmental health officers. According to the leader of the
Opposition "Areas of public health should be exempted from compulsory
competitive tendering ... where councils reduce the number of inspectors
they have in order to win the bid." He said food prosecutions had fallen
more than 70% from 1877 in 1993 to 543 last year, while penalties imposed in
courts had dropped 68% from 318 in 1993 to 103 last year.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Human Services said the decline in food
prosecutions could be a result of improved food handling procedures within
the industry. She denied that a reduction in the number of food inspectors
was linked to recent food poisonings.
Footnote: My personal belief is that there may well be some correllation
between a decline in food safety in Victoria and the decline in the total
number of food inspectors. It is the general public who suffers most when
cost cutting occurs in areas of health. Ultimately it is usually the very
young or the elderly who suffer most and ultimately, there may be tragic
loss of life.

Subject: Salmonella in Australia
Marguerite Wegner has correctly identified [in a previous posting. MHJ] a
perception in the general community that Victoria has a real problem in
food-borne disease. I have also seen this written in Australia's newspapers.
This has been largely based on comparing the (higher) numbers of reports of
food-borne disease coming out of Victoria recently with the (lower) numbers
of reports coming out of other states of the country.
I would like to make 3 points.
Firstly, not surprisingly, the number of Salmonella outbreaks tend to peak
in summer in Australia. We had a number in South Australia, a few weeks
before Victoria had their lot.
Secondly, only some clusters make the newspapers. These tend to be the ones
that require public warnings or public recalls of foodstuffs. Other states
may have had clusters that have been successfully investigated, that the
public may not be aware of.
Finally, and most importantly, although I don't have the figures, I doubt
that Victoria would have a higher rate of food-borne disease notifications
per capita than the rest of the country. What they do have are a group of
people who are very good at finding clusters in the mass of data that comes
into them. Then they are very good at determining a food that caused the
cluster of cases. In short, because they are good at their job, they are
generating a lot of (often adverse) publicity. The public is then looking at
the number of their successes and is interpreting it as a systemic problem
in food-borne disease in the state.

Subject: Salmonella infections - Australia Victoria
The Victorian Department of Human Services have advised that there were 822
reported cases of salmonellosis in 1996. In the smaller state of South
Australia a typical year results in 200-500 reported cases. There would be
many times more cases not reported and it can be safely concluded that
salmonellosis is a common infection with many thousands of cases occurring
around Australia each year. As has long been the case. If we take away the
ONE major incident in Victoria (bread rolls with 500+ reported cases) the
number of cases in the other Victorian outbreaks is scarcely significant
against the national or even the Victorian background. Against this
background it wouldn't take much of a cranking up of the epidemiology
investigations, anywhere, to uncover more outbreaks - especially in a
situation where exceptionally hot weather could increase the risk of food
poisoning.
So rather than ask what is wrong with the Victorian food safety system a
more logical question is to ask what is so good about the Victorian system
for uncovering outbreaks? Of course a better approach would be to ask
questions about how to deal with the thousands of background cases
experienced nationally. This is currently being addressed, at an industry
level at least, with national proposals for HACCP-based QA systems.

Subject: Two articles re Salmonella outbreaks [Australia]
Ex Victoria news sources
(A) 7th April 1997, Victoria, Australia
Pacific Meat Packers general manager Leo Susko believes the Victorian
salmonella ourbreak has not been caused due to processing. "With inspection
levels these days, the latest outbreak can only be to do with food handling
or lack of training of staff at that end," he said. "It is beyond meatworks
and even after processing of smallgoods, I believe it may have occurred at
the retail outlets. "It is happening outside the rigid standards now in
force in the processing industry,"
Pacific Meat in Thomastown is the first independent, off-site boning room in
Australia and New Zealand to achieve ISO 9002 accreditation for production
quality.

(B) Ex a livestock editor, Victoria , Australia 9th April 1997.
Victoria's meatworks watchdog has ruled out a return to government
inspection in domestic amattoirs following the recent food poisoning
outbreaks. Victorian meat authority chairman John Watson said the state's
company-based inspection system, introduced in 1994, has become the quality
benchmark for abattoirs. Mr Watson said none of the five seperate outbreaks
of salmonella in Melbourne in recent weeks had been traced to domestic
abattoirs, which are underpinned by a compulsory quality assurance scheme,
but had occured during curing, cooking or handling.
The authority has called for the rapid introduction of uniform, national
food hygiene standards for wholesalers and retailers based on the latest
quality assurance guidelines. But in a blow to the domestic processing
sector, retail giant Coles said it was sourcing all its national meat
requirements from two export accredited abattoirs. Coles retail spokesman
Greg Every said the export accreditation was an assurance to customers that
a system met a certain standard. "It is nothing against domestic abattoirs"
he said.
Mr Watson said the domestic abattoirs had become a convenient scapegoat for
unions with a vested interest in seeing a return to regulatory inspection.
"It wouldn't matter if you had 1,000 or 10,000 inspectors out there, they
can't be out there every minute if the day and they can't see these
dangerous pathogens" he said. Mr Watson dismissed claims by the Community
and Public Sector Union last week that domestic inspection systems weren't
up to export standard.
The union's food inspection branch secretary, Felicity Rafferty, said a
CSIRO trial had exposed domestic abattoirs as having much higher incidences
of salmonella bacteria than export abattoirs. But the CSIRO this week
responded to the claims, saying most of the sampling for the trial had taken
place prior to in-house inspection in 1994.
Meanwhile, senior government veterinarians have rejected claims the source
of recent salmonella outbreaks could have been infected cattle.

It should not be overlooked that a common mode of transmission of salmonella
to food animals occurs by rodents (mice, etc.). In particular, this is
believed to be the source of S. typhimurium in poultry. Pigs enjoy a tasty
rat when they come across one, and this is believed to be the source of
trichina in hogs.
Consequently the effects of weather in Victoria may be apropos, not because
of effects on microbiota or stress, but simply due to the effects on the
indigenous rodent population.

> SALMONELLA INFECTIONS - AUSTRALIA (VICTORIA) (04)
RE: Salmonella infections and temperature, supporting Oz:
UK reports that 16% of foodborne infection explosions (= 2 or more patients
involved) are caused "at home". Most problems caused by:
-- poultry
-- desserts
-- meat
-- meatproducts
Most important risk-factors turned out to be (in order of importance):
-- keeping too long time at too high temperature
-- insufficient heating
-- crosscontamination
Most important pathogen involved
-- Salmonella enteritidis 57%
-- Salmonella (other species) 20%
Reported source (in "Nieuwbrief VoedselVeiligheid", April 1997): Comm. Dis.
Report, review number 13, 6-Dec-1996.
A consciousness-raising INQUIRY:
It would be interesting if promed readers would report to me the highest and
lowest measured temperature in their own refrigerator at home.
My own refrigerator, because of its construction (cooled vertical wall at
the back):
>>>> Highest shelf= 12 degC (for beverages)
>>>> Lowest shelf = 3 degC (for meat, milk)
The problem may be that you need 2 thermometers at the same time..
Please fill in your own data and send them back to
>>>>> javr@pi.net
I will report a summary to promed.
