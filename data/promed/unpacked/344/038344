BRUSSELS: A European Union ban on meat-based livestock feed, imposed in
January to halt the spread of BSE, should be left in place until early next
year [2002, the European Commission said yesterday. Alarmed by the
emergence of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in countries across the
continent at the end of last year [2000, EU governments imposed a 6-month
ban on all meat-based livestock feed until the end of June [2001. It was
already outlawed as feed for cattle, but authorities believed abuse of the
rules meant meat-and-bone meal (MBM) had been finding its way into cattle
feed either during manufacture or on the farm.
The Commission said its view on an extension of the embargo was based on a
report drawn up by its officials in Brussels, and a formal proposal would
be drafted soon.
Though the practice of feeding MBM to cattle would remain outlawed, the
report said there was no scientific justification for imposing a permanent
ban on this type of feed for non-ruminants such as poultry and fish, the
Commission added. "A total permanent ban of feeding animal proteins to farm
animals may be appealing from a political point of view, but it would imply
recognition of the failure of member states, industry, and agricultural
interests to implement basic Community legislation," the report concluded.
But the full ban should stay until new laws on animal by-products is
adopted, foreseen for the start of 2002, it said. These will allow only
by-products from animals fit for human consumption to be used in livestock
feed, and would force a complete separation of rendering plants dedicated
to feed production from those processing other animal waste.
The report, which also recommends all existing stocks of MBM be destroyed
before the ban can be lifted, will be discussed by EU farm ministers
meeting next Tuesday in Luxembourg. Keeping the total ban in place for just
another 6 months beyond June [2001 would have advantages, the Commission
noted. It would eventually avoid the huge environmental consequences of
destruction of the 14 million tons of MBM produced in the EU every year.

Tests show BSE symptoms can be produced in cattle by scrapie agent
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[UK Government scientists have found evidence to support the theory that
the BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy epidemic was originally caused
by feeding cattle the rendered carcasses of sheep infected with scrapie.
The theory was dismissed last year as "fallacious" by the BSE inquiry, but
preliminary results of an experiment to test it have revealed that cows
injected with sheep scrapie fall ill with what appears to be BSE. Results
of the experiment were passed this week to the Government's spongiform
encephalopathy advisory committee (SEAC), but further work is needed before
the evidence can be considered conclusive.
Knowing the precise origin of BSE is important because it would reassure
scientists that the measures introduced to prevent a recurrence are
watertight. The experiment involved either feeding or injecting scrapie
into calves to see whether they were susceptible to the disease. So far, 2
calves have succumbed to BSE-type symptoms. Their brains are the subject of
postmortem tests. Scientists from the Veterinary Laboratories Agency near
Weybridge in Surrey began their investigation after criticism by SEAC in
1996 that research into the origins of BSE was sorely lacking.
As part of the current testing, 10 calves have been injected
intracerebrally with material from the brains of sheep that died of scrapie
before 1975, when it was thought there would be no risk of the sheep being
cross-contaminated with BSE. Another 10 calves were similarly injected with
scrapie material from sheep that died after 1990. Since the start of the
experiment in July 1999, one calf in each group has succumbed to BSE-like
symptoms.
Another experiment, started last September [2000, has involved feeding
scrapie material to separate groups of calves to see if the sheep disease
can be transmitted orally to cattle, as the "scrapie hypothesis" predicts.
Danny Matthews, the head of molecular biology at the Veterinary
Laboratories Agency, said that even if the cattle fed on scrapie developed
similar symptoms to cattle with BSE, it would take many years of further
tests on mice before that could be confirmed.
The BSE inquiry dismissed the scrapie hypothesis largely because many other
countries had also rendered sheep carcasses into cattle feed and had not
suffered a BSE epidemic. The inquiry suggested a spontaneous mutation in a
gene for the prion protein implicated in BSE and scrapie. The inquiry
concluded: "BSE probably originated from a novel source early in the 1970s,
possibly a cow or other animal that developed the disease as a consequence
of a gene mutation." However, Dr Matthews criticized the inquiry's
dismissal of the scrapie hypothesis. He said: "It's crazy that they should
have come up with that conclusion...I think the evidence for spontaneity is
pretty thin."
Other research into the origins of BSE is being done by Professor Gabriel
Horn, of Cambridge University, who has been asked by the Department of
Health and Ministry of Agriculture to investigate the idea that the
epidemic was caused by the rendering of a zoo animal carrying an endemic
form of the brain disease. Professor Horn said: "It is important to know
the origins of BSE because if we get some real insight that turns out to be
surprising it might alert us to a way we might act in the future to prevent
such a calamity."

[Producing symptoms of BSE in animals intracerebrally injected with scrapie
tissue is one thing, proving that scrapie is the origin of BSE is another.
