The outbreak of rabies in East Kalimantan, threatens to spread to Tawau and
the State Department of Veterinary Services and Animal Industry is
monitoring the situation.
It's director Datuk Ibrahim Mokhtar said his department is now coordinating
with the Tawau Municipal council to prevent the expected spread of the
disease by shooting stray dogs and taking samples from local dogs in the
border areas to see if these dogs had the rabies virus.
He warned that once the infected dogs from East Kalimantan crossed the
border, they could transmit the virus to other animals in [the] Tawau
district.
"By then, there is no stopping the infected dogs from crossing the border.
We cannot allow the local animals to be in contact with them," he said.
Datuk Ibrahim said the real danger is that Sabah has always been free from
any incident of rabies and the hospitals do not keep the vaccine to treat
infected persons.
