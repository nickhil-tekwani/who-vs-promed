Serbia: meningitis outbreak in Kosovo spreads
---------------------------------------------
Physicians in the Serbian province of Kosovo have registered 553 cases of
meningitis since an epidemic began on 1 Jul 2006. The Kosovo National
Health Institute in Pristina said 123 new cases of meningitis were
registered over the past week, raising the number of people infected with
the disease to 553, Belgrade's Beta news agency reported on Wed 30 Aug 2006.
Drinking water contaminated with waste is the main cause of meningitis
outbreaks in the predominantly ethnic-Albanian province of Kosovo. Ilir
Begolli, Director of the Health Institute, said the number of new cases has
been decreasing but not at a satisfactory pace, the agency said. He said
about 90 patients stricken with meningitis are in Pristina's clinical center.
The epidemic, which is spreading mainly among children, is under control,
and hospitals in Kosovo are well-equipped with doctors, equipment, and
medicine, Begolli said.
