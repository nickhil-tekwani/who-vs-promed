There have been 23 cases of rotavirus reported across the NT in the past few weeks, mostly children.

"Since late May 2018, there have been 23 cases reported, mostly in children from Central Australia, but further spread is likely," Centre for Disease Control Director Dr Vicki Krause said.

"Rotavirus can cause fever, vomiting and watery diarrhea. It is spread when objects, hands or foods contaminated with small amounts of feces from those infected find their way to the mouths of those uninfected, and often this is in very young children.

"Rotavirus mainly affects children under 5 years of age, but adults can also be infected and pass the virus on to others. Very young children are most at risk of becoming severely dehydrated during an infection.

"There are no specific treatments against rotavirus, but it is important that sick people drink plenty of fluids. This can be water, oral rehydration fluids, or fluids such as diluted fruit juice, one part fluid to four parts water. Babies should continue usual feeding and be offered extra boiled and cooled water in-between feeds.

"Babies with symptoms and young children who refuse fluids, are overly sleepy, and anyone who is very unwell should see a doctor. Sometimes hospitalization is necessary to manage dehydration."

The spread of rotavirus infection can be reduced by:
- thorough hand washing especially after using the toilet, changing nappies or handling soiled items and before handling food and drinks
- not letting the runny poo escape from a nappy [diaper] (disposable nappies with elastic around the legs may work better for this), careful nappy disposal and cleaning of nappy change areas
- never change nappies on tables or counters where food is prepared or eaten
- clean books, toys, equipment, furnishings, floors and toilets regularly (including toilet door).

Anyone with diarrhoea should not:
- prepare or handle food that will be eaten by others
- attend childcare/school for 24 hours after the diarrhoea has ceased
- swim, wade, or paddle in public pools.

Rotavirus vaccine is available on the NT immunisation schedule at 6 weeks and 4 months of age and must be given by 14 weeks and 6 days of age for dose 1, and 24 weeks and 6 days of age for dose 2.

Rotavirus vaccination will not prevent all cases of rotavirus, and even if a child is fully vaccinated, they may still develop rotavirus, but the disease will be much milder. Rotavirus vaccine is still recommended for children who have already had rotavirus, as only partial protection is achieved from disease.

[The following is extracted from a CDC webpage on rotavirus https://www.cdc.gov/rotavirus/clinical.html:

Rotavirus has a characteristic wheel-like appearance when viewed by an electron microscope. The name rotavirus is derived from the Latin word rota, meaning "wheel." Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, double-shelled viruses. The genome is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, which code for six structural and five nonstructural proteins. The virus is stable in the environment.

The primary mode of transmission is the fecal-oral route, usually through direct contact between people. Because the virus is stable in the environment, transmission also can occur through ingestion of contaminated water or food and contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. In the United States and other countries with a temperate climate, the disease has a winter and spring seasonal pattern, with annual epidemics occurring from December through June. The highest rates of illness occur among infants and young children, and most children are infected by age 5. Adults can also be infected, though disease tends to be milder.

Diagnosis may be made by rapid detection of rotavirus antigen in stool specimens. Strains may be further characterized by enzyme immunoassay or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, but such testing is not commonly done.

For people with healthy immune systems, rotavirus disease is self-limited, lasting for only a few days. Treatment is nonspecific and consists primarily of oral rehydration therapy to prevent dehydration. Prior to rotavirus vaccine introduction in the United States, about 1 out of 70 children would be infected with rotavirus disease requiring hospitalization for intravenous fluids before their 5th birthday.

The 2 rotavirus vaccines approved for use in infants in the United States were tested in large clinical trials and shown to be safe and effective. For about the 1st year of an infant's life, rotavirus vaccine provided 85 to 98 percent protection against severe rotavirus illness and against hospitalization from rotavirus illness, and 74 to 87 percent protection against rotavirus illness of any severity. - Mod.LL
