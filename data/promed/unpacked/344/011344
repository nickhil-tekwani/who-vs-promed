An 11-year-old girl died of rabies after being in a coma for a week. This is the 2nd case of death caused by rabies reported in Bolivia during May [2017]. The girl was in a coma at the Hospital Ni√±o Mario Ortiz, in Santa Cruz city, where she was hospitalized several days before. After being vaccinated against human papilloma virus, she felt sick and was taken to the hospital.

"Clinical exams and lab tests allow confirming that the cause of death was encephalitis due to rabies, and there is no possibility of this death to be linked to the vaccine against human papilloma virus", said Rodolfo Rocabado, of the Ministry of Health.

According to an official agency (ABI), the girl sheltered stray dogs at her home days before she felt ill.

At the beginning of May [2017], a 14 year-old youngster died of rabies in Santa Cruz.

[Bolivia is amongst the countries with the highest incidence of human rabies transmitted by dogs in the Western hemisphere. Canine rabies control activities require urgent action, but this has been challenging in Bolivia due to social, cultural, and economic factors. - Mod.PMB
