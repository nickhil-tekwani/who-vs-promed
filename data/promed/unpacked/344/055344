There is a rabies alert in a locality in Satu Mare county after a rabid fox played with a dog in a household, then it was found dead.

The analysis showed, without a doubt, the diagnosis. The dog in question was vaccinated against rabies, as well as its owner, and both touched the wild animal. In order not to spread the outbreak, the authorities took preventive measures.

The rabies outbreak was confirmed after a local from the center of Orașu Nou commune found a dead fox in the yard.

Gavril Mailat, mayor of Orașu Nou: "He entered the yard and played with the dog and in the meantime, he died. The citizen announced, the fox was picked up and after analysis, it turned out that there were big problems. The dog was vaccinated, as was the citizen who touched the animal."

Stray dogs will be collected from the area and vaccinated against rabies.

Radu Roca, prefect of Satu Mare: "All animals in the area have been restricted, all stray dogs have been identified and we have started vaccinating them. Protective measures were taken within a radius of 3 kilometers [about 2 mi]."

Specialists advise people to notify veterinarians as soon as they notice something suspicious in their animals' behavior. Untreated, rabies is [almost always] fatal.

[In Europe, the oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of red foxes (_Vulpes vulpes_), the main reservoir of rabies in the continent, was developed in the late 1970s and has demonstrated its effectiveness in the eradication of the disease in Western and some Central European countries. Besides red foxes, rabies is common in raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_, introduced in Europe), and also occurs in grey wolves (_Canis lupus_), arctic foxes (_Alopex lagopus_), badgers (_Meles meles_), pine martens (_Martes martes_), and polecats (_Mustela putorius_). Individuals of other species may occasionally be infected. - Mod.PMB
