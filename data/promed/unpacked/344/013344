[Batken is in southwest Kyrgyzstan bordering the Ferghana valley, which is rife with livestrock anthrax. Naryn is in the center of the country. See: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_physio-2005.jpg

The human cases reported in Batken in 2011 were in different villages -- Pulgon Batken and Toloykon Osh -- but the 2008 outbreak was in Kadamdzhay. I have found no previous reports in recent years of outbreaks in Naryn, though I would not be surprised if they had occurred under the radar. It is interesting to note that Bishkek reported no livestock outbreaks to OIE, Paris for 2014 -- but they did report 5 human cases. - Mod.MHJ
