Kawashima, director, International Animal Health Affairs Office,
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 21 Apr 2008
Date of 1st confirmation of event: 25 Apr 2008
Report date: 29 Apr 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 29 Apr 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2007
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Outbreak 1: Kosaka Town, Akita
Date of start of the outbreak: 21 Apr 2008
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Species: wild species
Susceptible: --
Cases: 4
Deaths: 4
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0
Affected population: swans

Outbreak statistics
Species: wild species
Apparent morbidity rate: **
Apparent mortality rate: **
Apparent case fatality rate: 100 percent
Proportion susceptible animals lost*: **
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,
and/or slaughter
** Total contains unknown quantity

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: the swans, of which 3 had died and one was
emaciated, were found on the shores of Lake Towada in Akita
Prefecture in the north of the country on 21 Apr 2008. Until 28 Apr
2008, the authorities have been monitoring the area but they have not
found any incident with a large number of deaths in wild birds. There
are no chicken farms within the 10-km (6.2 mi)-radius area where the
swans were found and no unusual incidents were observed in other
farms. Following the occurrence of this event, the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan has asked the prefecture
authorities of Akita, Aomori, and Iwate, which share the boundary of
the shores of Lake Towada, to strengthen the monitoring of the farms
in order to prevent the spread of the disease through early detection
and to report the measures applied regarding abnormal chickens, and
the prevention of the entry of wild birds into poultry houses. The
prefecture authorities will visit immediately the 15 chicken farms
for emergency on-site inspections within a 30-km (18.6 mi)-radius
area where the swans were found. They will also monitor the wild
birds around the area and cooperate with the Ministry of Environment
on the surveillance measures of wild birds.

Control measures
Measures applied:
- vaccination prohibited
- no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Akita Chuo Livestock Hygiene Service Center
(prefectural organization) (local laboratory)
Species: wild species
Test: pathogen isolation by egg inoculation
Test date: 25 Apr 2008
Result: positive

Laboratory name and type: National Institute of Animal Health
(national laboratory)
Species: wild species
Test: intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI)
Test date: 29 Apr 2008
Result: positive

Species: wild species
Test: neuraminidase inhibition assay
Test date: 29 Apr 2008
Result: positive

[Akita Prefecture is a popular tourist destination in Japan, located
in the farthest northern reaches of Honshu, which is the largest
island. Lake Towada is a caldera (crater) lake, and is about 450 km
(280 mi) from Tokyo. This location, is far removed from Korea and in
a remote rural part of Japan.

Migration patterns for North American swans, which can be accessed at
<http://www.npwrc.usgs.gov/resource/birds/migratio/patterns.htm>,
indicate movement of swans occurs over great distances. Within a
week, hundreds of miles can be covered -- see Bird Studies Canada
data at <http://www.bsc-eoc.org/lpbo/swans/20180.html>.

Given the above, it would be very useful to compare genetic analysis
of the H5N1 isolates from Japan and Korea, although movement from
Korea to Japan doesn't appear to be a major migratory pathway for swans.
