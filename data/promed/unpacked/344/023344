Measles cases 351.8 percent higher this year
--------------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DoH) released Friday [9 Apr 2010] its
latest data on measles incidence in the country which has reached
1473 since 1 Jan 2010, which is 351.8 percent higher than the number
of cases in the same period last year. Health experts recorded a
total of 3648 suspect measles cases but discarded 1380 as non-measles
while the results of 795 are pending in the laboratory.

The DoH recorded 8 deaths resulting from the disease during the
covered period this year while there were only 3 deaths in 2009 in
the same given period. The DoH said 5 of the fatalities were less
than 12 months of age and 2 cases belonged to the one to 4 years age
group. One case belonged to the 10 to 14 years age range.

The list identified the regions with the most number of measles
cases. These included the National Capital Region (NCR), Calabarzon,
Central Luzon and Bicol. Outbreaks of laboratory-confirmed measles
were also seen in NCR, Ilocos region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon and
CAR. The other day, DoH Secretary Esperanza I. Cabral said cases have
to go down in the following weeks before the DoH can declare that the
measles season is over.

National Epidemiology Center (NEC) chief Dr. Eric Tayag said measles
is transmitted through airborne droplets. Compared to influenza, one
person afflicted with measles can affect 12 to 18 other children or
people. A sick person can transmit the disease to another person even
4 days before the onset of rashes and 5 days after the rashes appear.
The typical incubation period of measles is 10 days.

"Even without the rash, a child with measles is already infectious,"
Tayag warned. Earlier, Tayag disclosed that the most severe
complications caused by measles are disorders of the brain such as
encephalitis and panencephalitis.

[Up to 1990 the Philippines had reported one of the highest measles
rates in this region. Measles rates in the Philippines declined
dramatically after 1990, in parallel with increased vaccination usage
(see the graph at
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/measles-phil.jpg>.

No measles cases were reported from June 2004 to December 2006, a
historic achievement for the Philippines as a consequence of the 2004
Ligtas Tigdas Campaign of the Health Department [a special nationwide
vaccination month for children who were at high risk of getting
measles]. The campaign, which aimed to vaccinate 18 million children
between 9 months and 8 years of age using a door-to-door strategy
nationwide, decreased measles cases in the country by 96 percent and
deaths from measles by 99 percent.

Recently there has been a resurgence in measles cases probably as a
consequence of relaxation of the vaccination programme due to current
financial constraints.
