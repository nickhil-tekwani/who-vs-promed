Yellow fever advances to the south; the number of cases quadruples
------------------------------------------------------------------
While the health authorities discuss measures against swine flu, sylvatic
yellow fever [YF] is progressing to the south and south east of the country
and the number of fatalities caused by the disease has increased 4-fold.
Traditionally endemic in northern and west-central states, yellow fever,
according the Ministry of Health, was this year [2009] only in 2 states:
Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, where 43 people were infected and 16 died
as a consequence of the disease.

In 2008, these 2 states together accounted for only 4 [yellow fever] deaths
(2 in Sao Paulo and 2 in Rio Grande do Sul), a number 4 times lower. Before
that, the last death in Sao Paulo had been recorded in 2000. Up until then,
in Rio Grande do Sul no [YF] deaths had occurred after 1990.

In Sao Paulo, 9 people died between 22 Feb-1 Apr of this year [2009]. In
total, 25 cases of the disease were confirmed. The fatality rate reached 36
per cent.

Among the 25 confirmed cases, 16 (64 per cent) were men. The age ranged
from 8 days of life to 52 years, averaging 30 years. None were vaccinated
against yellow fever and their activities were in rural or forested
environments, the probable location of [acquisition of the] infection.

All symptomatic cases had blood samples collected and laboratory tests are
in progress. The 20 people with mild symptoms are being monitored, awaiting
diagnostic confirmation.

In Rio Grande do Sul, in which up to 2008 the disease had not been known --
was considered a "free area" (free of the disease) -- 18 [YF] cases were
confirmed and 7 people died.

The escalation of the disease prompted the authorities to initiate mass
immunization in the 2 states. In Sao Paulo, where the disease this year
[2009] progressed from the north west region to the south west of the
state, 2.5 million doses of the vaccine were distributed from January-April
and 895 408 doses were given in 44 municipalities, among them Buri,
Saratuia, Itatinga, and Piraju, where cases and deaths were confirmed.

The number of doses, applied up to 22 Apr [2009] corresponds to 89 per cent
of the resident population in 44 municipalities, which up to 2008 were free
of the disease. In the state, 374 municipalities are within the area of
[YF] risk.

In Rio Grande do Sul, where the [case] fatality of the disease reached 39
per cent, mass vaccination continues. According to the Ministry Health, the
State, which until 2008 had no record of the disease, now has a large
endemic area involving 272 municipalities. There are 81 affected
municipalities and 190 in the risk zone, which now involves the [state]
capital, Porto Alegre, where mass vaccination was performed this weekend
[9-10 May 2009], after 2 monkeys were found dead in the neighboring
municipality of Guaiba.

In Sao Paulo, according to Helena Sato, coordinator of immunization of the
state Secretariat of Health, the situation is now relatively calm, but
surveillance is on alert. "But the situation is only thus because we acted
fast; the 1st reported case was on 13 Mar [2009] and on just the next day
we started mass vaccination," she said.

Since 1 Apr [2009] the State has not confirmed any [YF] cases.
Environmentalists explain the advance of yellow fever in other regions of
Sao Paulo as the result of deforestation, mainly that near springs, the
habitat of the _Haemagogus_ mosquito [sylvan or jungle vector of yellow
fever virus. - Mod.TY], but once infected in a forested area, the person
can, in return, serve as a source of infection for _Aedes aegypti_, the
main [urban] transmitter of yellow fever [virus] and urban vector of dengue
[virus].

[As I have commented before, and I repeat: yellow fever does not
"progress", it always has been in the south, but only for reasons not yet
well understood, its transmission intensifies from time to time. - Mod.LJS
